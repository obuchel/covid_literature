An awareness of the ethical aspects of surgical practice that involve non-technical skills and judgment is of vital concern to surgical educators and encompasses disparate issues ranging from adequate supervision of trainees to surgical care access. METHODS: This bibliographical research effort seeks to report on ethical challenges from a sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) perspective as found in the peer-reviewed literature employing African Journals Online, Bioline, and other sources with African information as well as PubMed and PubMed Central. The principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice offer a framework for a study of issues including: access to care (socioeconomic issues and distance from health facilities); resource utilization and decision making based on availability and cost of resources, including ICU and terminal extubation; informed consent (both communication about reasonable expectations post-procedure and research participation); research ethics, including local projects and international collaboration; quality and safety including supervision of less experienced professionals; and those religious and cultural issues that may affect any ethical decision making. The religious and cultural environment receives attention because beliefs and traditions affect medical choices ranging from acceptance of procedures, amputations, to end-of-life decisions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Ethics awareness and ethics education should be a vital component of non-technical skills training in surgical education and medical practice in SSA for trainees. Continuing professional development of faculty should include an awareness of ethical issues.","Tarpley, Margaret J.; Costas-Chavarri, Ainhoa; Akinyi, Beryl; Tarpley, John L.",World J Surg,669,1

In England, a 2018 national strategy on loneliness was published, and public health guidelines recommend participation in social activities. In the absence of existing economic evidence, we modelled the potential cost effectiveness of a service that connects lonely older people to social activities against no-intervention. A 5-year Markov model was constructed from a health and social care perspective. Parameters were drawn from the literature, with the intervention structure based on an existing loneliness alleviation programme implemented in several settings across England. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. The total expected cost per participant in the intervention group is £7131 compared to £6783 in the usual care group with 0.45 loneliness free years (LFY) gained. The incremental cost per LFY gained is £768; in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis the intervention is cost saving in 3.5% of iterations. Potentially such interventions may be cost-effective but are unlikely to be cost-saving even allowing for sustained effects and cumulative adverse health and social care events averted. Empirical studies are needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of these interventions, ideally mapping changes in loneliness to the quality of life, in order to allow the key metric in health economic studies, cost per quality adjusted life year to be estimated.","McDaid, David; Park, A-La",Int J Environ Res Public Health,669,1

Population growth and increasing life expectancies call for effective healthy aging strategies inclusive of immunization to reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, improve quality of life, and mitigate antimicrobial resistance. Based on a review of available literature on the pneumococcal disease, influenza, and herpes zoster epidemiology and economic burden, and the health systems and policy barriers for adult immunization, we identified evidence gaps and considerations for prioritizing adult immunization. The body of evidence for adult immunization and the health and economic burden of adult disease is heavily concentrated in high-income countries. The few countries reporting adult immunization policies generally focus on high-risk groups. Despite robust child immunization programs in most countries, adult immunization programs and policies lag far behind and there is a general lack of appropriate delivery platforms. Global adult disease burden and economic costs are substantial but evidence from low- and middle-income countries is limited. There is a need for a strengthened evidence base and political commitment to drive a comprehensive, global technical consensus on adult immunization.","Sauer, Molly; Vasudevan, Prarthana; Meghani, Ankita; Luthra, Karuna; Garcia, Cristina; Knoll, Maria Deloria; Privor-Dumm, Lois",Vaccine,669,9

Phylogenetic comparisons were made between phylotypes obtained in this study and environmental and clinical phylotypes for establishing the possible origin of selected bacterial species isolated from wet market cutting board ecosystems. The results reveal a strong relationship between wet market bacterial assemblages and environmental and clinically relevant phylotypes. However, our poor knowledge of potential cross-contamination sources within these wet markets is further exacerbated by failing to determine the exact or presumed origin of its identified pathogens. In this study, several clinically relevant bacterial pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus suis and Streptococcus porcinus were linked to cutting boards associated with pork; Campylobacter fetus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and A. caviae in those associated with poultry; and Streptococcus varanii, A. caviae, Vibrio fluvialis, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in those associated with seafood. Identifying non-foodborne clinically relevant pathogens in wet market cutting boards in this study confirms the need for safety approaches for wet market meat, including cold storage. The presented study justifies the need for future systematic epidemiological studies to determine identified microbial pathogens. Such studies should bring about significant improvements in the management of hygienic practices in Hong Kong's wet markets and work towards a One Health goal by recognizing the importance of wet markets as areas interconnecting food processing with animal and clinical environments.","Rao, Subramanya; Ngan, Wing Yui; Chan, Long Chung; Sekoai, Patrick Thabang; Fung, Aster Hei Yiu; Pu, Yang; Yao, Yuan; Habimana, Olivier",One Health,669,22

These receptors trigger inflammatory responses, activate innate immune responses, and prime adaptive immune responses to eradicate invading microbes [1]. TLR are members of a family of pattern-recognition receptors, which recognize molecular structures of bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa (pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs), as well as endogenous structures and proteins released during inflammation (damage/danger-associated molecular patterns or DAMPs). To date, ten different TLR have been identified in humans and twelve in mice. TLR are expressed on all cells of the immune system, but also on parenchymal cells of many organs and tissues. The binding of a PAMP to a TLR results in cellular activation and initiates a variety of effector functions, including cytokine secretion, proliferation’ co-stimulation or phagocyte maturation. To facilitate microbial recognition and to amplify cellular responses, certain TLR require additional proteins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP), CD14, CD36 and high mobility group box-l protein (HMGB-l). In this chapter, the role of CD14 as an accessory receptor for TLR in lung inflammation and infection is discussed. The central role of CD14 in the recognition of various PAMPs and amplification of immune and inflammatory responses in the lung is depicted in Fig. 1.","Anas, A.; Van Der Poll, T.; De Vas, A.

Here, we investigated whether cholesterol is important during the initial steps of SARS‐CoV spike (S) glycoprotein‐mediated entry. Vero cells were treated with the cholesterol sequestering drug methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin (mβCD) and then exposed to SARS‐CoV and Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with SARS‐CoV spike glycoprotein (VSV‐ΔG‐S). Furthermore, a cell‐based binding assay and a binding assay with soluble S protein demonstrated that the binding of S to its receptor angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is affected by cholesterol depletion and that multi‐ligand interactions might be important for the entry process of SARS‐CoV to target cells. Confocal laser microscopy studies and a membrane flotation assay in Vero cells show that the SARS‐CoV receptor is organized within lipid microdomains and cholesterol depletion results in a reduction of ACE2 in the buoyant detergent resistant membrane fraction after Triton‐X 100 solubilization. Further attempts are directed to understand the molecular role of cholesterol during the initial steps of SARS‐CoV life cycle.","Glende, Joerg H; Pfefferle, Susanne; Drosten, Christian; Schwegmann‐Weßels, Christel; Herrler, Georg",FASEB J,669,1

A wide variety of transporter proteins are expressed in apical and basolateral membranes and collectively play complex interactive roles in controlling the entire organism’s overall metabolism of amino acids. Regulation of the transport systems can be manifested at many levels, including gene splicing and promoter regulation, interactions between requisite subunits of oligomers, thermodynamic electrochemical gradients contributed by ion exchangers, overlap of substrate specificity, selective tissue distribution, and specific spatial distribution of transporters leading to net vectorial flow of the amino acids. The next frontier for workers in this field is to uncover a comprehensive molecular understanding of the manner by which epithelial cells signal gene expression of transporters as triggered by substrates, hormones or other triggers, in order to further understand the trafficking and interactions among multimeric transport system proteins, to extend discoveries of novel small drug substrates for oral and ocular delivery, and to examine gene therapy or nanotherapy of diseases using small molecules delivered via amino acid transporters.","Stevens, Bruce R.",Epithelial Transport Physiology,669,12

Given the inherently distressing nature of chronic pain, there is a need to equip individuals with pain education and self-regulatory skills that are shown to improve adaptation and improve their response to medical treatments. Brief, targeted behavioral medicine interventions may efficiently address the key individual factors, improve self-regulation in the context of pain, and reduce the need for opioid therapy. This highlights the critical need for targeted, cost-effective interventions that efficiently address the key psychological factors that can amplify the need for opioids and increased risk for misuse. In this trial, the primary goal is to test the comparative efficacy of a single-session skills-based pain management class to a health education active control group among patients with chronic pain who are taking opioids. METHODS/DESIGN: Our study is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial testing the superiority of our 2-h, single-session skills-based pain management class against a 2-h health education class. We will enroll 136 adult patients with mixed-etiology chronic pain who are taking opioid prescription medication and randomize 1:1 to one of the two treatment arms. We hypothesize superiority for the skills-based pain class for pain control, self-regulation of pain-specific distress, and reduced opioid use measured by daily morphine equivalent. Team researchers masked to treatment assignment will assess outcomes up to 12 months post treatment. DISCUSSION: This study aims to test the utility of a single-session, 2-h skills-based pain management class to improve self-regulation of pain and reduce opioid use. Findings from our project have the potential to shift current research and clinical paradigms by testing a brief and scalable intervention that could reduce the need for opioids and prevent misuse effectively, efficiently, and economically. Further, elucidation of the mechanisms of opioid use can facilitate refinement of more targeted future treatments. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03950791.

However, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe has resulted a newer challenge and paradigm for an evolving socio-scientific priorities. It is generally expected that the impacts of the pandemic would be in shorter time-scale, while the planned time and pathway for attaining the SDG are typically mandated in longer-term, hence may remain mostly unaffected. However, the stringent lockdown measures, isolated economies and financial burden to contain the pandemic emergency have resulted to slowdown of socio-economic development, which if continues for a longer period, would put a question mark on developing plans and pathways to achieve the SDGs, even in decadal-scale. Hence, in these newer times, it is important to understand the real priorities of availability of clean water and air, which are already stressed worldwide and in India, because of various natural and human-influenced triggers. This ongoing pandemic has provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the impact of human development and consequent feedback of nature and human society in pre- and post-COVID scenarios on water–air–human life, which can help to re-think and re-orient the societal development priorities. It is a rare opportunity for scientists to impress the policy-makers with real-time examples on the efficacies of potential mitigation strategies for climate change, water and air pollution, and the importance of enduring investment on environmental causes and consequent benefits that can secure health and development for our future generations. HIGHLIGHTS: Environmental pollution and climate change pose a high risk for human survival. Develop resilience to attain SDGs in spite of economic constraints caused by COVID-19.

Program description: ZFETP was established as a tripartite arrangement between the Zambia MoH, the University of Zambia School of Public Health, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The program runs two tiers: Advanced and Frontline. To date, ZFETP has enrolled three FETP-Advanced cohorts (training 24 residents) and four Frontline cohorts (training 71 trainees). In 2016, ZFETP moved organizationally to the newly established Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI).

These successes attracted investment from the Government of Republic of Zambia (GRZ) and donors, thus accelerating field epidemiology workforce capacity development in Zambia. In its first five years, ZFETP achieved early success due in part to commitment from GRZ, and organizational positioning within the newly formed ZNPHI, which have catalyzed ZFETP´s institutionalization.

We and others have previously reported that an engineered deletion of 183 nucleotides in the nsP3 gene attenuates chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and reduces in vivo viral replication and viremia after challenge in mice, macaques and man. Here, we demonstrated that in vitro transfection of iRNA carrying the nsP3 deletion generated infectious viruses, and after intramuscular injection, the iRNA induced robust antibody responses in mice. The iRNA was superior at eliciting binding and neutralizing antibody responses as compared to a DNA vaccine encoding the same RNA (iDNA) or a non-propagating RNA replicon (RREP) lacking the capsid encoding gene. Subsequent challenge with a high dose of CHIKV demonstrated that the antibody responses induced by this vaccine candidate protected animals from viremia. The iRNA approach constitutes a novel vaccine platform with the potential to impact the spread of CHIKV. Moreover, we believe that this approach is likely applicable also to other positive-strand viruses.","Szurgot, Inga; Ljungberg, Karl; Kümmerer, Beate M.; Liljeström, Peter",Sci Rep,669,10

Aurora-A kinase inhibitors have shown encouraging results in clinical trials but have not gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. An innovative computational workflow named Docking-based Comparative Intermolecular Contacts Analysis (dbCICA) was applied—aiming to identify novel Aurora-A kinase inhibitors—using seventy-nine reported Aurora-A kinase inhibitors to specify the best possible docking settings needed to fit into the active-site binding pocket of Aurora-A kinase crystal structure, in a process that only potent ligands contact critical binding-site spots, distinct from those occupied by less-active ligands. Optimal dbCICA models were transformed into two corresponding pharmacophores. The optimal one, in capturing active hits and discarding inactive ones, validated by receiver operating characteristic analysis, was used as a virtual in-silico search query for screening new molecules from the National Cancer Institute database. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay was used to assess the activity of captured molecules and five promising Aurora-A kinase inhibitors were identified. The activity was next validated using a cell culture anti-proliferative assay (MTT) and revealed a most potent lead 85(NCI 14040) molecule after 72 h of incubation, scoring IC(50) values of 3.5–11.0 μM against PANC1 (pancreas), PC-3 (prostate), T-47D and MDA-MB-231 (breast)cancer cells, and showing favorable safety profiles (27.5 μM IC(50) on fibroblasts).

To address this gap in knowledge we evaluate neural targets defined by activation and functional connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-anchored cognitive control circuit, regions of the default mode network and attention circuit, and interactions with the subgenual anterior cingulate. We evaluate whether these targets and interactions between them change in a dose-dependent manner, whether changes in these neural targets correspond to changes in cognitive behavioral performance, and whether baseline and early change in neural target and cognitive behavioral performance predict subsequent symptom severity, suicidality, and quality of life outcomes. This study is designed as a pragmatic, mechanistic trial partnering with the National Clinical TMS Program of the Veteran’s Health Administration. METHODS: Target enrollment consists of 100 veterans with pharmacoresistant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). All veterans will receive a clinical course of TMS and will be assessed at ‘baseline’ pre-TMS commencement, ‘first week’ after initiation of TMS (targeting five sessions) and ‘post-treatment’ at the completion of TMS (targeting 30 sessions). Veterans will be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a cognitive behavioral performance battery, and established questionnaires. Multivariate linear mixed models will be used to assess whether neural targets change with TMS as a function of dose (Aim 1), whether extent and change of neural target relates to and predicts extent of behavioral performance (Aim 3), and whether extent of neural target change predicts improvement in symptom severity, suicidality, and quality of life (Aim 3). For all three aims, we will also assess the contribution of baseline moderators such as biological sex and age. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, our study will be the first pragmatic, mechanistic observational trial to use fMRI imaging and cognitive-behavioral performance as biomarkers of TMS treatment response in pharmacoresistant MDD. The results of this trial will allow providers to select suitable candidates for TMS treatment and better predict treatment response by assessing circuit connectivity and cognitive-behavioral performance at baseline and during early treatment.

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of a simple rule for QTc estimation, comparing the measurements obtained with those provided by the commonly used equations of Bazett, Fridericia, Framingham, and Hodges. Methods We used the database of a previous observational study, which analyzed patients prospectively with acute pulmonary edema admitted in an emergency service. One hundred four patients were included for QTc assessment, of whom 86 patients underwent two ECG: one ECG <24h and other >24h after admission. Thus, a total of 190 ECGs were analyzed by two observers that manually measured QT and HR. QTc was obtained using the known formulae and the proposed equations: QTc = QT+2 (FC-60) for HR ≤ 90 bpm and QTc=QT+2(FC-60)-10 for HR>90 bpm. Results Bland-Altman plots show good agreement between the simple rule and Hodges equation, with a mean difference of -3,4, SD of 4.96 and 95% limits of agreement from -9,9 to 3.2. There was not a good agreement between the simple method and the other formulae. Conclusion The proposed method has good agreement with the measures of QTc by the equation of Hodges in the HR range of 40 to 130bpm in acutely ill patients. Our method may be a plausible option for quick QT correction in these subjects.","De Oliveira Neto, Nestor R; De Oliveira, William Santos; Campos Pinto, Guilherme D; De Oliveira, Eric Santos R; Da Silveira Barros, Maria das Neves D",,669,1

They created a ‘hybrid governance’ platform in which companies, governments, NGOs, and knowledge institutes can work on achieving common goals through targeted action and serve as the leading global sustainable development framework until 2030. By the year 2020, however, progress towards the goals proved slow, prompting the UN to announce a ‘Decade of Action’. The slow or limited adoption and implementation of the SDG Agenda by MNEs – in close interaction with government policies – is one of the root causes for delayed progress. The question is no longer ‘why’ MNEs should develop sustainability strategies, but rather ‘how’. A number of related questions arise. What have been the roles of MNEs in progress towards the SDGs, what is needed from them in the future, and what can be the role of international business (IB) scholarship in shaping discussion and action? This Special Issue tackles these questions from four angles: (1) identifying and helping to fill theoretical gaps in IB research on the SDGs; (2) asking which SDGs and targets provide promising venues for societally relevant IB research topics; (3) assessing and helping to fill empirical gaps by using, complementing, and upgrading relevant SDG indicators; and (4) showing how IB research and policy practice can become better aligned.","Van Tulder, Rob; Rodrigues, Suzana B.; Mirza, Hafiz; Sexsmith, Kathleen",J Int Bus Policy,669,17

First, mathematics can picture a crisis. This is in accordance with the classic interpretation of mathematical modelling, which highlights that a mathematical model provides a representation of a piece of reality, a reality that could be a critical situation such as, for instance, a pandemic. Second, mathematics can constitute a crisis, meaning that mathematics can form an intrinsic part of the very dynamics of a crisis. This phenomenon can be illustrated by the economic crises that spread around the world in 2008. Third, mathematics can format a crisis. This final formulation refers to a situation where a mathematical reading of a crisis brings about ways of acting in the critical situation that might be adequate, but also counterproductive, if not catastrophic. This is illustrated with reference to the potential crises due to climate changes. As a conclusion, the paper addresses the politics of crises, which refers to the power that can be acted out through a crisis discourse in which mathematics may come to play a deplorable role.","Skovsmose, Ole",Educ Stud Math,669,26

Thereafter, however, contract awards to European companies for trains and aircraft were overturned and given to Japanese or American companies on political grounds. Then, a high profile dispute over compulsory licensing of technology, plus continuing barriers to trade and a decline in trade as patterns shifted following China’s accession to the WTO, together with political concerns over cross-strait tensions, led to a cooling in EU-Taiwan relations.

Technological solutions are a complement that can help citizens to be informed about the risk in their environment. Although measures such as contact traceability have been successful in some countries, their use raises society’s resistance. This paper proposes a variation of the consensus processes in directed networks to create a risk map of a determined area. The process shares information with trusted contacts: people we would notify in the case of being infected. When the process converges, each participant would have obtained the risk map for the selected zone. A consensus simulation has been introduced in an SEIR model to evaluate how having available a risk map could affect the virus’s propagation. The scenario chosen is La Gomera Island: a region where the Spanish government has tested its contact tracing app (RadarCOVID). The paper also compares both strategies joint and separately: contact tracing to detect potential infections, and risk maps to avoid movements into conflictive areas. Contact tracing apps could work with 40% of participants instead of 60%. On the other hand, the elaboration of risk maps could work with just a 20% of active installations. Nevertheless, the effect is to delay the propagation instead of reducing the contagion. With both strategies actives, we significantly reduce infected peoples with a relatively low participant number.","Rebollo, Miguel; Benito, Rosa M.; Losada, Juan C.; Galeano, Javier",Complex Networks & Their Applications IX,669,1

To explore the value of this function this study used a qualitative method, guided by the Socio-Technical Framework, to understand how the CTI function is interpreted by organizations in South Africa. Thematic analysis was used to provide an in-depth view of how each organization implemented its CTI function and what benefits and challenges they’ve experienced. Findings show that CTI tasks tend to be more manual and resource-intensive, but these challenges can be resolved through automation. It was noted that only larger organizations seem to have the budget and resources available to implement the CTI function, whereas smaller organizations put more reliance on tools. It was observed that skills for the CTI function can be learned on the job, but that formal education provides a good foundation. The findings illustrate the value the CTI function can provide an organization but also the challenges, thereby enabling other organizations to improve preparation before such a function is adopted.","Berndt, Anzel; Ophoff, Jacques",Information Security Education,669,1

RECENT FINDINGS: Pediatric tracheostomy is performed in approximately 0.2% of inpatient stays among tertiary pediatric hospitals. Mortality in children with tracheostomies ranges from 10–20% due to significant comorbidities in this population. Tracheostomy-specific mortality and complications are now rare. Recent global initiatives have aimed to optimize decision-making, lower surgical costs, reduce the length of intensive care, and eliminate perioperative wound complications. The safest road to tracheostomy decannulation in children remains to be both patient and provider dependent.

This study investigates the link between luxury goods advertising and expected utility from a biological perspective by looking at males’ hormonal responses to advertising of luxury versus non-luxury branded goods. Using traditional and consumer neuroscience methods, we collected salivary testosterone data pre- and post-ad viewing. Self-reported scores on social and quality value of the brands were compared to salivary testosterone levels from participants placed in different social conditions (Alone versus Together with another person). The results show that higher post-viewing testosterone levels were associated with higher scores on quality, but not on social value and only for branded goods viewed in the Together condition, compared to the Alone condition. These results suggest that changes in testosterone levels reflect a rewarding experience or activate social competitiveness when male consumers appraise the quality but not the social value of the advertised luxury goods and that social context modulates this effect.

An important contribution to the overall success is the effectiveness of the governmental communication strategy in achieving the desired cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes. Analysis of the qualitative data collected from twelve focus group discussions with a total of 60 participants revealed that due to the government’s communication efforts, Vietnamese people have adequate information/knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic, and majority of them experience low emotional levels of anxiety, fear, dread, stress, and panic. Moreover, the communication strategy has helped to form both health-promoting and safety-seeking behaviors among the community. Further, the characteristics of an effective communication strategy such as reliable sources of communication, usages of multiple social media channels, and transparent message contents in the form of infographic or video clips are identified.","Tam, Le Thanh; Ho, Huong Xuan; Nguyen, Dong Phong; Elias, Arun; Le, Angelina Nhat Hanh",Glob J Flex Syst Manag,669,1

METHOD: This observational study from a UK Major Trauma Centre matched a cohort of patients admitted during a 10-week period of the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic (09/03/2020 to 18/05/2020) to a historical cohort admitted during a similar time period in 2019 (11/03/2019 to 20/05/2019). Demographic differences, injury method and severity were compared using Fisher’s and Chi-squared tests. Multivariable logistic regression examined the associated factors predicting 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Of 642 patients, 405 and 237 were in the 2019 and 2020 cohorts respectively. 1.69%(4/237) of the 2020 cohort tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. There was a 41.5% decrease in trauma admissions in 2020. The 2020 cohort was older (median 46 vs.40 years), more comorbid and frailer (p < 0.0015). There was a significant difference in injury method with a decrease in vehicle related trauma, but an increase in falls. There was a 2-fold increased risk of mortality in the 2020 cohort that in adjusted models, was explained by higher injury severity and frailty. Positive SARS-CoV-2 status was not associated with increased mortality on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients admitted during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic were older, frailer, more co-morbid and had an increased risk of mortality.","Adiamah, A; Thompson, A i; Lewis-Lloyd, C; Dickson, E; Blackburn, L; Moody, N; Gida, S; La Valle, A; Reilly, J J; Saunders, J; Brooks, A",Br J Surg,669,1

It is well recognised that there is strong gender disparity in surgery. The wider challenges further experienced by pregnant surgical trainees are also well documented. METHOD: NHS digital data on the surgical workforce and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists COVID-19 guidance for pregnant healthcare workers was reviewed. RESULTS: Women account for 27% of the surgical workforce and the average time taken to complete training is longer for female trainees. Current guidelines for pregnant healthcare workers advise strict social distancing measures up to 28 weeks gestation with avoidance of high-risk areas including operating theatres. A non-patient facing role is advised from 28 weeks onward. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has created additional barriers for women in surgery. Restrictions for pregnant trainees, whilst vital for their wellbeing, has denied access to some essential training opportunities necessary for progression. It will likely further isolate them from the workforce and hinder their advancement into senior roles where they are already underrepresented. Although it is recognised that surgical training in general has been impacted by COVID-19 there is an argument that this disproportionately affects pregnant trainees.","Pendegast, H",Br J Surg,669,1

The effective active ingredients and targets of SCDP were determined from the TCMSP database, and the drug ingredient-target network was constructed using the Cytoscape software. The disease targets related to UC were searched in GeneCards, DisGeNET, OMIM, and DrugBank databases. Then, the drug ingredient and disease targets were intersected to construct a protein-protein interaction network through the STRING database. The Metascape database was used for the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses of the predicted targets of SCDP for UC. The Autodock software was used for molecular docking between the main active ingredient and the core target to evaluate the binding ability. SCDP has 43 effective active ingredients and 134 intersection targets. Core targets included AKT1, TP53, IL-6, VEGFA, CASP3, JUN, TNF, MYC, EGFR, and PTGS2. GO functional enrichment analysis showed that biological process was mainly associated with a cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, response to an inorganic substance, response to a toxic substance, response to lipopolysaccharide, reactive oxygen species metabolic process, positive regulation of cell death, apoptotic signaling pathway, and response to wounding. KEGG enrichment analysis showed main pathway concentrations were related to pathways in cancer, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, bladder cancer, IL-17 signaling pathway, apoptosis, p53 signaling pathway, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The drug active ingredient-core target-key pathway network contains 41 nodes and 108 edges, of which quercetin, wogonin, baicalein, acacetin, oroxylin A, and beta-sitosterol are important active ingredients; PTGS2, CASP3, TP53, IL-6, TNF, and AKT1 are important targets; and the pathways involved in UC treatment include pathways in cancer, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic, apoptosis, IL-17 signaling pathway and herpes simplex infection. The active ingredient has a good binding capacity to the core target. SCDP key active ingredients are mainly quercetin, wogonin, baicalein, acacetin, oroxylin A, and beta-sitosterol, which function mainly by regulating targets, such as PTGS2, CASP3, TP53, IL-6, TNF, and AKT1, and are associated with multiple signaling pathways as pathways in cancer, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, apoptosis, IL-17 signaling pathways.","Niu, Kai; Li, Qifang; Liu, Yuan; Qiao, Yi; Li, Bingbing; Wei, Chao; Wang, Kunrui; Cui, Lu'an; Zheng, Canlei; Wang, Rong; Zhang, Li; Zhang, Honghua; Sun, Bing; Yu, Bin",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,669,1

However, most of such methods analyze the images under only one scale, and the deep learning models are always unexplainable. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based multi-scale and multi-level fusing approach of CNNs for liver lesion diagnosis on magnetic resonance images, termed as MMF-CNN. We introduce a multi-scale representation strategy to encode both the local and semi-local complementary information of the images. To take advantage of the complementary information of multi-scale representations, we propose a multi-level fusion method to combine the information of both the feature level and the decision level hierarchically and generate a robust diagnostic classifier based on deep learning. We further explore the explanation of the diagnosis decision of the deep neural network through visualizing the areas of interest of the network. A new scoring method is designed to evaluate whether the attention maps can highlight the relevant radiological features. The explanation and visualization make the decision-making process of the deep neural network transparent for the clinicians. We apply our proposed approach to various state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","Wan, Yuchai; Zheng, Zhongshu; Liu, Ran; Zhu, Zheng; Zhou, Hongen; Zhang, Xun; Boumaraf, Said",Life (Basel),669,20

Androgen action in target tissues may partially mediate entry of SAR‐CoV‐2 and male patients have been shown to suffer increased severity and mortality compared with females. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive‐age women and is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology. PCOS is associated with obesity and cardiometabolic dysfunctions, both being risk factors associated with severe COVID‐19 pathology. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of hyperandrogenism in a female mouse model of PCOS and to characterize the differences in host machinery required for SARS‐CoV‐2 viral entry in multiple tissues that are affected by COVID‐19 in humans. METHODS: Female mice were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 8 mg) s.c. for 90 days. Body composition was measured by EchoMRI. Fasting glucose was determined by an enzymatic method and the oral glucose tolerance test was performed with an oral glucose load (2g glucose per kg lean mass weight). mRNA and protein levels of ACE2, Tmprss2, Cathepsin L, Furin, Tmprss4, and Adam17 were quantified by RT‐qPCR, Western‐blot, and ELISA in tissues, serum, and urine. All differences are considered significant p<0.05. RESULTS: DHT treatment increased body weight, fat and lean mass. DHT treated females showed altered glucose homeostasis, having increased fasting glucose (201.10 ± 11.11 vs. 152.80 ± 9.23 mg/dL, p<0.05) and an increased area under the curve (209.2 ± 11.0 vs. 160.8 ± 3.5 mg.min/dL, p<0.05) by OGTT. The small intestine was shown to have the greatest relative Ace2 mRNA expression compared with the other tissues. Ace2 mRNA was upregulated in DHT‐treated animals in the lung (1.24‐fold), cecum (4.4‐fold), left ventricle (1.54‐fold), and kidney (2.37‐fold), and was downregulated in DHT‐treated animals in the brain (0.68‐fold) and colon (0.37‐fold). ACE2 protein expression was increased in the small intestine (1.98‐fold), left ventricle (1.30‐fold), and kidney (1.32‐fold). The SARS‐CoV‐2 priming proteases Tmprss2, Cathepsin L, and Furin mRNA were upregulated by DHT in the kidney, and protein TMPRSS2 was increased in the small intestine (1.38‐fold). ACE2 sheddase Adam17 mRNA was upregulated in the kidney by DHT, which corresponded with increased urinary ACE2 in DHT‐treated mice (14.13±3.33 vs. 0.55±0.19 pg/ng creatinine, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the potential for increased cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal dysfunction in PCOS women with COVID‐19. The differences observed in androgen‐treated mice highlight that several mechanisms involved in SARS‐CoV‐2entry may be altered in women with PCOS and translate to the reduced protection of specific target organs known to be susceptible to COVID‐19 injury.","Huffman, Alexandra; Rezq, Samar; Basnet, Jelina; Yanes Cardozo, Licy; Romero, Damian",FASEB J,669,16

Computed tomography (CT) is indicated for treatment refractory or recurrent infiltrates, difficult differential diagnostics, suspected complications and in immunocompromised patients. Thoracic sonography can be used as an alternative method for initial diagnostics and in the intensive care unit to monitor progress. In addition to the detection of infiltrates the radiological classification can help to limit the pathogen spectrum. Radiologically, three forms of pneumonia can principally be differentiated: lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia. Furthermore, there are special forms of pneumonia with certain pathogens, such as aspergilloma, invasive mycosis, postprimary tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteriosis or in a specific clinical context, such as aspiration pneumonia, postinfarction pneumonia, retention pneumonia and septic emboli. The most frequent complications of pneumonia are lung abscesses and pleural empyema. Both can sometimes but not always be seen in the X‑ray image. If clinically suspected the indications for CT should be generously applied. Certain pre-existing diseases, such as immunodeficiency or structural alterations of the lungs can predispose to pulmonary infections, frequently with unusual pathogens or manifestation forms and must be taken into account in the diagnostics.","Dettmer, Sabine; Vogel-Claussen, Jens",Pneumologe (Berl),669,16

The problem and quality of human-robot interaction (HRI) has become a widely debated topic in academia. Especially when HSRs are applied in the hospitality industry, some researchers believe that the current HRI model is not well adapted to the complex social environment. HSRs generally lack the ability to accurately recognize human intentions and understand social scenarios. This study proposes a novel interactive framework suitable for HSRs. The proposed framework is grounded on the novel integration of Trevarthen’s (2001) companionship theory and neural image captioning (NIC) generation algorithm. By integrating image-to-natural interactivity generation and communicating with the environment to better interact with the stakeholder, thereby changing from interaction to a bionic-companionship. Compared to previous research a novel interactive system is developed based on the bionic-companionship framework. The humanoid service robot was integrated with the system to conduct preliminary tests. The results show that the interactive system based on the bionic-companionship framework can help the service humanoid robot to effectively respond to changes in the interactive environment, for example give different responses to the same character in different scenes.","Yang, Jiaji; Chew, Esyin; Liu, Pengcheng",PeerJ Comput Sci,669,1

However, most of these previous studies have focused only on the early stage of succession, uncovering the role of the predecessor and the successor. Only a few studies have made efforts to examine the total lifecycle of succession. The purpose of this study is to explore the process of the transition in successors' behavior and mindset while managing long-lived small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises throughout the lifecycle of succession. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six successors of small and medium-sized manufacturing companies who are more than half a century old. Their answers were analyzed using the Modified-GTA method to construct a hypothetical model. Results: In total, 46 concepts, four categories, 17 subcategories, and one core category were generated. An analysis result diagram using all concepts and categories was formed. From the observation of this diagram, the successors gained confidence in management through the dilemma between autonomy and constraint in the early stage of succession, which was found in previous research. Following the initial stage, the successors responded to the crisis caused by market constraints and created autonomous strategies in their businesses. Conclusions: By experiencing repetitive crises, the successors tend to acquire new perspectives toward the naturally occurring crises. This change of premise by the successors is considered as the process of double-loop learning. Relationships inside and outside the company influence the generation of this viewpoint. From a long-term perspective, a sense of unity with employees, stable employment, and the pursuit of enjoyment constitute the successors' own values in this model.","Suzuki, Hiroo; Kino, Yasunobu",F1000Res,669,16

We aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of Bacillus subtilis DSM29784 (BS) on the treatment of Clostridium perfringens (CP)-induced SNE in broilers. A total of 360 1-day-old broiler chicks were divided into three treatment groups, namely control (Ctr), SNE, and BS treatment (BST) groups, all of which were fed with a basal died for 21days, and then from day 22 onward, only the BST group had a BS supplemented diet (1×10(9) colony-forming units BS/kg). On day 15, all chicks, except the Ctr group, were challenged with a 20-fold dose coccidiosis vaccine and 1ml CP (2×10(8)) on days 18–21 for SNE induction. Beneficial effects were observed on growth performance in BST compared to SNE broilers. BST treatment alleviated intestinal lesions and increased the villus height/crypt depth ratio. Further, BST broilers showed increased maltase activity in the duodenum compared with SNE chicks, and a significantly decreased caspase-3 protein expression in the jejunum mucosa. Moreover, an increased abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Bifidobacterium beneficial gut bacteria and an altered gut metabolome were observed. Taken together, we demonstrate that the manipulation of microbial gut composition using probiotics may be a promising prevention strategy for SNE by improving the composition and metabolism of the intestinal microbiota, intestinal structure, and reducing inflammation and apoptosis. Hence, BS potentially has active ingredients that may be used as antibiotic substitutes and effectively reduces the economic losses caused by SNE. The findings of this study provide a scientific foundation for BS application in broiler feed in the future.","Wang, Yuanyuan; Xu, Yibin; Xu, Shengliang; Yang, Jinyong; Wang, Kaiying; Zhan, Xiuan",Front Microbiol,669,6

Five latent mental wellness profiles emerged, including two ordered profiles (i.e., High Well-Being and Low Well-Being) and three profiles spanning the two ordered profiles. The High Well-Being profile had the most favorable psychological adjustment, and the three moderate well-being range profiles had differentiated functioning. Informing the utility of the MHC-SF, this study also compared the MHC-SF categorical diagnostic criteria with the LPA’s empirical classification approach and found the two classification approaches to be congruent.

In time series analysis problems, we deal with discrete-time, when each observation of a parameter forms a time frame. The same can be said about the behavior of Covid-19 over time. In this paper, we solve the problem of predicting Covid-19 diseases in the world using neural networks. This approach is useful when it is necessary to overcome difficulties related to non-stationarity, incompleteness, unknown distribution of data, or when statistical methods are not completely satisfactory. The problem of forecasting is solved with the help of the analytical platform Deductor Studio, developed by specialists of the company Intersoft Lab of the Russian Federation. When solving this problem, appropriate methods were used to clean the data from noise and anomalies, which ensured the quality of building a predictive model and obtaining forecast values for tens of days ahead.

Because patients auto-emit aerosols containing viable virus, these aerosols can be further propagated when patients undergo certain treatments including continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. This study aimed to assess the degree of viable virus propagated from mask leak in a PAP circuit. METHODS: Bacteriophage PhiX174 (108copies/mL) was nebulised into a custom PAP circuit. Mask leak was systematically varied to 0, 7, 21, 28 and 42 L/min at the mask interface. Plates containing Escherichia coli assessed the degree of viable virus settling on surfaces around the room. In order to contain virus spread a ventilated headboard and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was tested. RESULTS: Increasing mask leak was associated with virus contamination in a dose response manner (χ2= 58.24, df=4, p<0.001). Clinically relevant levels of leak (≥21 L/min) were associated with virus counts equivalent to using PAP with a standard vented mask. Viable viruses were recorded on all plates (up to 3.86m from source). A plastic hood with HEPA filtration significantly reduced viable viruses on all plates. HEPA exchange rates of 170 and 470m3/hr eradicated all evidence of virus contamination. DISCUSSION: Mask leak from PAP circuits may be a major source of environmental contamination and nosocomial spread of infectious respiratory diseases. Subclinical levels of leak should be treated as an infectious risk. Cheap and low-cost patient hoods with HEPA filtration are an effective countermeasure.","Landry, S; Barr, J; MacDonald, M; Hamilton, G; Mansfield, D; Edwards, B; Joosten, S",Sleep Adv,669,5

However, the impact of baseline lipid profile on clinical endpoints in COVID-19 and the potential effect of COVID-19 on lipid profile remain unclear. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we consecutively enrolled 430 adult COVID-19 patients from two Chinese hospitals (one each in Chengdu and Wuhan). The lipid profile before admission and during the disease course and the clinical endpoint including in-hospital death or oropharyngeal swab test positive again (OSTPA) after discharge were collected. We used Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression to explore the lipid risk factors before admission associated with endpoints. Then, we assessed the lipid level change along with the disease course to determine the relationship between pathology alteration and the lipid change. RESULTS: In the Chengdu cohort, multivariable Cox regression showed that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) dyslipidemia before admission was associated with OSTPA after discharge for COVID-19 patients (RR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.19, 5.29, p = 0.006). In the Wuhan cohort, the patients with triglyceride (TG) dyslipidemia had an increased risk of in-hospital death (RR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.08, 3.60, p = 0.016). In addition, in both cohorts, the lipid levels gradually decreased in the in-hospital death or OSTPA subgroups since admission. On admission, we also noticed the relationship between the biomarkers of inflammation and the organ function measures and this lipid level in both cohorts. For example, after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, smoking, and drinking status, the C-reactive protein level was negatively associated with the TC lipid level [β (SE) = -0.646 (0.219), p = 0.005]. However, an increased level of alanine aminotransferase, which indicates impaired hepatic function, was positively associated with total cholesterol (TC) lipid levels in the Chengdu cohort [β (SE) = 0.633 (0.229), p = 0.007]. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline dyslipidemia should be considered as a risk factor for poor prognosis of COVID-19. However, lipid levels may be altered during the COVID-19 course, since lipidology may be distinctly affected by both inflammation and organic damage for SARS-CoV-2.","Jin, Hui; He, Junji; Dong, Chuan; Li, Bin; Ma, Zhiyue; Li, Bilan; Huang, Tiande; Fan, Jiangang; He, Gang; Zhao, Xiaolong",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,669,11

However, for the types of services required to provide an episode of HaH, full Medicare reimbursement is traditionally paid only if care is provided in inpatient facilities. DESIGN This project identifies HaH services that could be reimbursable under Medicare to inform episodic care within fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare. SETTING All data are derived from acute services provided from the Mount Sinai HaH program between 2014 and 2017 as part of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) demonstration program. PARTICIPANTS The sample was limited to patients with one of the following five admitting diagnoses: urinary tract infection (n = 70), pneumonia (n = 60), cellulitis (n = 45), heart failure (n = 37), and chronic lung disease (n = 24) for a total of 236 acute episodes. MEASUREMENTS HaH services were inventoried from three sources: electronic medical records, Medicare billing and itemized vendor billing. For each admitting diagnosis, four reimbursement scenarios were evaluated: (1) FFS Medicare without a home health episode, (2) FFS Medicare with a home health episode, (3) two-sided risk ACO with a home health episode, and (4) two-sided risk ACO without a home health episode. RESULTS Across diagnoses, there were 1.5-1.9 MD visits and 1.5-2.7 nursing visits per episode. The Medicare FFS model without home health care had the lowest reimbursement potential ($964-$1604) per episode. The Medicare fee-for-service within ACO models with home health care had the greatest potential for reimbursement $4519-$4718. There was limited variation in costs by diagnosis. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Though existing payment models might be used to pay for many HaH acute services, significant gaps in reimbursement remain. Extending the benefits of HaH to the Medicare beneficiaries that are likely to derive the greatest benefit will require new payment models for FFS Medicare.","DeCherrie, Linda V; Wardlow, Liane; Ornstein, Katherine A; Crowley, Christopher; Lubetsky, Sara; Stuck, Amy R; Siu, Albert L",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,669,1

PURPOSE To investigate the outcome of endovascular treatment of large and giant aneurysms and the long-term angiographic follow-up results. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of all patients with endovascular treatment of large and giant aneurysms between 1998 and 2009 was performed. There were 90 large or giant aneurysms treated with coiling alone, stent-assisted coiling, covered-stent deployment, or parent artery occlusion (PAO) in 88 patients (female/male, 54/34; age range, 23-92 years; mean age, 56 years). RESULTS Immediately after the initial endovascular embolization procedure, complete occlusion was achieved in 56.7%, near complete occlusion in 37.8%, and incomplete occlusion in 5.5%. The total periprocedural complication rate excluding subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced vasospasm was 10.2% with a mortality rate of 2.3%. Follow-up angiography was performed in all of the aneurysms with the longest follow-up duration of 131 months. Among 38 aneurysms initially treated with coiling alone and 17 initially treated with stent-assisted coiling, 22 (57.9%) and four (23.5%) recurred, respectively, during follow-up. No recurrence occurred in aneurysms initially treated with covered-stent deployment or PAO. Aneurysm recurrence was predominantly seen in older and female patients, in larger aneurysms, and in aneurysms treated with coiling alone. Twenty-three aneurysms were successfully retreated endovascularly. CONCLUSION Endovascular intervention with coiling alone or stent-assisted coiling for large and giant cerebral aneurysms is not very effective, while covered stents are more promising. Better endovascular devices are needed to obtain more secure closure.","Wang, Bing; Gao, Bu-Lang; Xu, Guo-Ping; Xiang, Cheng; Liu, Xiao-Sheng",Acta radiologica,669,30

The first outbreak of PDCoV occurred in the United States in 2014 and was followed by reports of PDCoV in South Korea, China, Thailand, Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Vietnam, leading to economic losses for pig farms and posing a considerable threat to the swine industry worldwide. Our previous studies have shown that PDCoV encodes three accessory proteins, NS6, NS7, and NS7a, but the functions of these proteins in viral replication, pathogenesis, and immune regulation remain unclear. Here, we found that ectopic expression of accessory protein NS6 significantly inhibits Sendai virus-induced interferon beta (IFN-β) production as well as the activation of transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB. Interestingly, NS6 does not impede the IFN-β promoter activation mediated via key molecules in the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway, specifically RIG-I, MDA5, and their downstream molecules MAVS, TBK1, IKKε, and IRF3. Further analyses revealed that NS6 is not an RNA-binding protein; however, it interacts with RIG-I/MDA5. This interaction attenuates the binding of double-stranded RNA by RIG-I/MDA5, resulting in the reduction of RLR-mediated IFN-β production. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ectopic expression of NS6 antagonizes IFN-β production by interfering with the binding of RIG-I/MDA5 to double-stranded RNA, revealing a new strategy employed by PDCoV accessory proteins to counteract the host innate antiviral immune response.IMPORTANCE Coronavirus accessory proteins are species specific, and they perform multiple functions in viral pathogenicity and immunity, such as acting as IFN antagonists and cell death inducers. Our previous studies have shown that PDCoV encodes three accessory proteins. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that PDCoV accessory protein NS6 antagonizes IFN-β production by interacting with RIG-I and MDA5 to impede their association with double-stranded RNA. This is an efficient strategy of antagonizing type I IFN production by disrupting the binding of host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These findings deepen our understanding of the function of accessory protein NS6, and they may direct us toward novel therapeutic targets and lead to the development of more effective vaccines against PDCoV infection.","Fang, Puxian; Fang, Liurong; Ren, Jie; Hong, Yingying; Liu, Xiaorong; Zhao, Yunyang; Wang, Dang; Peng, Guiqing; Xiao, Shaobo",Journal of virology,669,1

Accidental falls are a common and clinically significant adverse event in people living with and beyond cancer and rates are higher than in the rest of the population. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of prescribed or provided exercise for reducing accidental falls, and falls risk factors of strength, flexibility and balance, in people living with and beyond cancer. SEARCH METHODS We searched the following electronic databases from inception to 10 July 2018, with no restrictions: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and seven other databases. We searched clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for ongoing trials, and reference lists of reviews and retrieved articles for additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all randomised controlled trials investigating exercise interventions versus no treatment, usual care or non-exercise interventions on falls incidence or falls risk factors in adults living with and beyond cancer (18 years of age or older at diagnosis). We excluded cross-over studies and studies in acute or inpatient hospice care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS At least two review authors independently completed data extraction for included papers. We used Covidence software to manage screening, data collection and extraction. We assessed evidence using GRADE and presented results in a 'Summary of findings' table. MAIN RESULTS Eleven studies (835 participants) compared exercise to usual care. No studies compared exercise with no treatment or non-exercise interventions. The quality of the evidence was very low for the primary outcome rates of falls, and very low to low for the secondary outcomes. We downgraded the evidence due to study limitations (risk of bias), and issues of imprecision due to small sample sizes, inconsistency and indirectness. All studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel due to inability to blind participants to an exercise intervention. Risk of bias was generally low or unclear for other categories.There was generally little information on the important outcomes comparing exercise to usual care.Rates of falls and number of fallers: one study (223 participants) measured accidental falls, but reported neither the rate of falls or the number of fallers; there was no difference in the number of falls between exercise and usual care (very low-quality evidence).Strength: 10 studies (813 participants) reported on strength outcomes. Two analyses favoured exercise over usual care: quadriceps strength (2 studies, 72 participants; mean difference (MD) 8.99 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 16.70; low-quality evidence), and leg press (4 studies, 388 participants; MD 21.1 kg, 95% CI 8.47 to 33.74; low-quality evidence). In one analysis of the Sit-to-Stand Test, there was no difference between exercise and usual care (4 studies, 214 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.45, 95% CI -1.05 to 0.14; very low-quality evidence).Flexibility: one study (21 participants) reported on flexibility for Sit-and-Reach Distance (MD 2.05 cm, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.51; very low-quality evidence).Balance: five studies (350 participants) measured three different balance outcomes. Two analyses favoured exercise over usual care: postural balance (4 studies, 127 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.44, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.79; very low-quality evidence), and Backward Walk Test (2 studies, 280 participants; SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.01; low-quality evidence). There was no difference between exercise and usual care for the Timed Up-and-Go Test (1 study, 15 participants; MD -0.35 seconds, 95% CI -1.47 to 0.77; low-quality evidence).Number of people sustaining a fall-related fracture: the quality of the evidence for exercise reducing fall-related fractures was very low.Adverse events: a single study (223 participants) noted some temporary muscle soreness on initiation of exercise or when there was an increase in the weight lifted. As no occurrence data were reported, we could not assess this variable further. No studies reported musculoskeletal injury. Analysis indicated that there was very low-quality evidence that exercise did not increase fatigue. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is a paucity of evidence for exercise training to reduce fall rates in people living with and beyond cancer. Exercise training may improve strength, flexibility and balance for people in this population, but the evidence is very low quality.","Williams, Andrew D; Bird, Marie-Louise; Hardcastle, Sibella Gk; Kirschbaum, Mark; Ogden, Kathryn J; Walters, Julia Ae",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,669,24

In colorectal surgery, ERAS pathways reduced perioperative morbidity, hospital stay and costs. Similar concept should be applied for liver surgery. This study presents the specific ERAS Society recommendations for liver surgery based on the best available evidence and on expert consensus. METHODS A systematic review was performed on ERAS for liver surgery by searching EMBASE and Medline. Five independent reviewers selected relevant articles. Quality of randomized trials was assessed according to the Jadad score and CONSORT statement. The level of evidence for each item was determined using the GRADE system. The Delphi method was used to validate the final recommendations. RESULTS A total of 157 full texts were screened. Thirty-seven articles were included in the systematic review, and 16 of the 23 standard ERAS items were studied specifically for liver surgery. Consensus was reached among experts after 3 rounds. Prophylactic nasogastric intubation and prophylactic abdominal drainage should be omitted. The use of postoperative oral laxatives and minimally invasive surgery results in a quicker bowel recovery and shorter hospital stay. Goal-directed fluid therapy with maintenance of a low intraoperative central venous pressure induces faster recovery. Early oral intake and mobilization are recommended. There is no evidence to prefer epidural to other types of analgesia. CONCLUSIONS The current ERAS recommendations were elaborated based on the best available evidence and endorsed by the Delphi method. Nevertheless, prospective studies need to confirm the clinical use of the suggested protocol.","Melloul, Emmanuel; Hübner, Martin; Scott, Michael; Snowden, Chris; Prentis, James; Dejong, Cornelis H C; Garden, O James; Farges, Olivier; Kokudo, Norihiro; Vauthey, Jean-Nicolas; Clavien, Pierre-Alain; Demartines, Nicolas",World journal of surgery,669,1

However, there is an increasing amount and complexity of data available that may lend itself to alternative analytic approaches using machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) methods. We performed a systematic review of the current application of ML or AI approaches to the analysis of EHR and AHD in geriatric mental health. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to identify potential studies. We included all articles that used ML or AI methods on topics related to geriatric mental health utilizing EHR or AHD data. We assessed study quality either by Prediction model Risk OF Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) or Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist. Results: We initially identified 391 articles through an electronic database and reference search, and 21 articles met inclusion criteria. Among the selected studies, EHR was the most used data type, and the datasets were mainly structured. A variety of ML and AI methods were used, with prediction or classification being the main application of ML or AI with the random forest as the most common ML technique. Dementia was the most common mental health condition observed. The relative advantages of ML or AI techniques compared to biostatistical methods were generally not assessed. Only in three studies, low risk of bias (ROB) was observed according to all the PROBAST domains but in none according to QUADAS-2 domains. The quality of study reporting could be further improved. Conclusion: There are currently relatively few studies using ML and AI in geriatric mental health research using EHR and AHD methods, although this field is expanding. Aside from dementia, there are few studies of other geriatric mental health conditions. The lack of consistent information in the selected studies precludes precise comparisons between them. Improving the quality of reporting of ML and AI work in the future would help improve research in the field. Other courses of improvement include using common data models to collect/organize data, and common datasets for ML model validation.","Chowdhury, Mohammad; Cervantes, Eddie Gasca; Chan, Wai-Yip; Seitz, Dallas P",Frontiers in psychiatry,669,19

This study describes several innovative and clinically relevant strategies to manipulate thymic function based on an interventional radiology technique for intrathymic injection of cells or drugs. We show that intrathymic injection of multipotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells into irradiated syngeneic or allogeneic young or aged recipients resulted in efficient and long-lasting generation of functional donor T cells. Persistence of intrathymic donor cells was associated with intrathymic presence of cells resembling long-term hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting a self-renewal capacity of the intrathymically injected cells. Furthermore, our approach enabled the induction of long-term antigen-specific T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity following intrathymic injection of progenitor cells harboring a transgenic T-cell receptor gene. The intrathymic injection of interleukin-7 prior to irradiation conferred radioprotection. In addition, thymopoiesis of aged mice improved with a single intrathymic administration of low-dose keratinocyte growth factor, an effect that was sustained even in the setting of radiation-induced injury. Taken together, we established a preclinical framework for the development of novel clinical protocols to establish lifelong antigen-specific T-cell immunity.","Tuckett, Andrea Z; Thornton, Raymond H; Shono, Yusuke; Smith, Odette M; Levy, Emily R; Kreines, Fabiana M; van den Brink, Marcel R M; Zakrzewski, Johannes L",Blood,669,1

Such employment practices may have an impact on workers' health and well-being. This systematic review explores the impact rotation work has on mental and physical outcomes in rotation workers in the resources and construction sectors. METHOD The PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases were systematically searched on 1 May 2020 to identify quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method studies addressing the health of rotation workers published in peer-reviewed journals. Findings from the studies were summarised narratively. RESULTS Of 6268 studies retrieved, 90 studies were included in the review. Studies suggested higher prevalence of psychological distress in onshore rotation workers and higher overweight/obesity rates among rotation workers as compared with the general population. We found more sleep problems and higher levels of smoking during work periods compared with off-site days; and higher alcohol intake during off-site days compared with on-site days. Workers generally perceived their physical health status as good. High-perceived job demands (such as workload, repetitive work) were associated with mental distress and exhaustion, sleep problems and perceived poor physical health status, while high-perceived job resources (such as job clarity/control, support) were associated with low mental distress and exhaustion, less smoking and alcohol intake, and better sleep. CONCLUSION Rotation work is associated with several poorer health behaviours and outcomes, such as sleep problems, smoking, alcohol consumption and overweight/obesity.

Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to find out whether COVID-19 may cause different manifestations and outcomes in the antepartum and postpartum period or not. MATERIAL AND METHODS We searched databases, including Medline (PubMed), Embase, Scopus, Web of sciences, Cochrane library, Ovid, and CINHAL to retrieve all articles reporting the prevalence of maternal and neonatal complications, in addition to clinical manifestations, in pregnant women with COVID-19 that published with English language January to November 2020. RESULTS Seventy-four studies with total 5560 pregnant women included in this systematic review. The results show that the pooled prevalence of neonatal mortality, lower birth weight, stillbirth, premature birth, and intrauterine fetal distress in women with COVID-19 was 4% (95% Cl: 1 - 9%), 21% (95% Cl: 11 - 31%), 2% (95% Cl: 1 - 6%), 28% (95% Cl: 13 - 43%), and 14% (95% Cl: 4 - 25%); respectively. Moreover, the pooled prevalence of fever, cough, diarrhea, and dyspnea were 56% (95% Cl: 32 - 81%), 29% (95% Cl: 21 - 38%), 9% (95% Cl: 2 - 16%), and 3% (95% Cl: 1 - 6%) in pregnant women with COVID-19. Two studies reported that pregnant women with severe COVID pneumonia have higher levels of d-dimer. Also, COVID pneumonia is more common in pregnant women than non-pregnant. CONCLUSION According to this meta-analysis, pregnant women with COVID-19 with or without pneumonia, are at a higher risk of preeclampsia, preterm birth, miscarriage and cesarean delivery. Furthermore, the risk of LBW and intrauterine fetal distress seems to be increased in neonates. In addition, our evaluations are investigative of higher risk of COVID-19 in the third trimester in pregnant women comparing to the first and second trimester. It can be due to higher BMI in the third trimester causing to increase the likelihood of disease deterioration, which can trigger a cascade of side effects starting with coagulation, pneumonia, hypoxemia affecting the placenta leading to ICU admission, fetal distress, premature birth and higher rates of C-section.","Soheili, Marzieh; Moradi, Ghobad; Baradaran, Hamid Reza; Soheili, Maryam; Mokhtari, Mohammad Mahdi; Moradi, Yousef","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",669,23

Fever may be attributed to both infectious and noninfectious causes, and its development in critically ill adult medical patients is associated with an increased risk for death. Although it is widespread and clinically accepted practice to therapeutically lower temperature in patients with hyperthermic syndromes, patients with marked hyperpyrexia, and selected populations such as those with neurologic impairment, it is controversial whether most medical patients with moderate degrees of fever should be treated with antipyretic or direct cooling therapies. Although treatment of fever may improve patient comfort and reduce metabolic demand, fever is a normal adaptive response to infection and its suppression is potentially harmful. Clinical trials specifically comparing fever management strategies in neurologically intact critically ill medical patients are needed.","Laupland, Kevin B",Critical care medicine,669,24

Herein, we review the results of ultra-fast-track (UFT) extubation, which refers to extubation performed on the operating table just after the operation, or within 1-2 hours after surgery, in patients with congenital cardiac disease. Methods We performed UFT extubation in patients (n=72) with a relatively simple congenital cardiac defect or who underwent a simple operation starting in September 2016. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of our recently introduced UFT extubation strategy, we retrospectively reviewed 195 patients who underwent similar operations for similar diseases from September 2015 to September 2017, including the 1-year periods immediately before and after the introduction of the UFT extubation protocol. Propensity scores were used to assess the effects of UFT extubation on length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), hospital LOS, and medical costs. Results After propensity-score matching using logistic regression analysis, 47 patients were matched in each group. The mean ICU LOS (16.3±28.6 [UFT] vs. 28.0±16.8 [non-UFT] hours, p=0.018) was significantly shorter in the UFT group. The total medical costs (182.6±3.5 [UFT] vs. 187.1±55.6 [non-UFT] ×100,000 Korean won [KRW], p=0.639) and hospital stay expenses (48.3±13.6 [UFT] vs. 54.8±29.0 [non-UFT] ×100,000 KRW, p=0.164) did not significantly differ between the groups. Conclusion UFT extubation decreased the ICU LOS and mechanical ventilation time, but was not associated with postoperative hospital LOS or medical expenses in patients with simple congenital cardiac disease.","Kim, Kang Min; Kwak, Jae Gun; Shin, Beatrice Chia-Hui; Kim, Eung Re; Lee, Ji-Hyun; Kim, Eun Hee; Kim, Jin Tae; Kim, Woong-Han",The Korean journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,669,1

Several factors have been postulated to contribute to this high incidence, including fracture type, displacement, the undulating nature of the physis, and fracture reduction/fixation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the position of percutaneous smooth pins across the physis contributes to physeal bar formation. METHODS The previously validated New Zealand white rabbit model was used. Power analysis determined that 30 animals were required. All animals had a constant 0.045 smooth Kirschner (K) wire placed under fluoroscopic guidance from the distal lateral femur across the physis centrally. A second 0.045 K-wire was placed in a cross-pin configuration from the medial side in one of 2 positions: zone 1--crossing the physis centrally or zone 2--crossing the physis peripherally. Pins were removed after 4 weeks and micro computed tomography was performed at 8 weeks to assess for physeal bar formation. Histologic analysis was performed to confirm bar formation. RESULTS Two physeal bars (7%) were seen after removal of the constant (lateral pin). The peripheral pin resulted in bar formation in 2 animals (13%) and the central pin in 1 animal (7%). A χ² test was performed; there was no statistically significant difference between zones in terms of bar formation (P=0.5428). CONCLUSIONS Injury to the growth plate after distal femoral fracture may be unavoidable. Treatment is aimed to minimize further injury to the physis. Cross-pinning with smooth K-wires results in a low rate of physeal injury. Pins that cross the physis both centrally and peripherally appear to have the same risk for physeal bar formation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE This study reveals that physeal bar formation can be seen with smaller than previously reported cross-sectional damage to the distal femoral physis. This study highlights the need to carefully select and perform fixation of the distal femoral physis with as little additional trauma to the physis as possible.","Dahl, William J; Silva, Selina; Vanderhave, Kelly L",Journal of pediatric orthopedics,669,11

There is a continuing controversy about whether one agent is superior to the other. METHODS In this multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned patients with shock to receive either dopamine or norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor therapy to restore and maintain blood pressure. When blood pressure could not be maintained with a dose of 20 microg per kilogram of body weight per minute for dopamine or a dose of 0.19 microg per kilogram per minute for norepinephrine, open-label norepinephrine, epinephrine, or vasopressin could be added. The primary outcome was the rate of death at 28 days after randomization; secondary end points included the number of days without need for organ support and the occurrence of adverse events. RESULTS The trial included 1679 patients, of whom 858 were assigned to dopamine and 821 to norepinephrine. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death at 28 days (52.5% in the dopamine group and 48.5% in the norepinephrine group; odds ratio with dopamine, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.42; P=0.10). However, there were more arrhythmic events among the patients treated with dopamine than among those treated with norepinephrine (207 events [24.1%] vs. 102 events [12.4%], P<0.001). A subgroup analysis showed that dopamine, as compared with norepinephrine, was associated with an increased rate of death at 28 days among the 280 patients with cardiogenic shock but not among the 1044 patients with septic shock or the 263 with hypovolemic shock (P=0.03 for cardiogenic shock, P=0.19 for septic shock, and P=0.84 for hypovolemic shock, in Kaplan-Meier analyses). CONCLUSIONS Although there was no significant difference in the rate of death between patients with shock who were treated with dopamine as the first-line vasopressor agent and those who were treated with norepinephrine, the use of dopamine was associated with a greater number of adverse events.

Materials and Methods: Eighteen cyclists (V̇O2peak: 57 ± 7 ml·kg-1·min-1) were pair-matched for anaerobic capacity determined by maximal accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD) and allocated to a 4-week interval training in hypoxia (IHT; FiO2 = 14.7% ± 0.5%, n = 9) or interval training in normoxia (NORM; FiO2 = 20.6% ± 0.3%, n = 9). Cyclists completed twice weekly interval training (8 × 1 minutes: ∼120% V̇O2peak, 5 minutes recovery: ∼50% V̇O2peak) in addition to their habitual training. Before and after the intervention, a constant work rate supramaximal time to fatigue and a graded exercise test were used to determine changes in anaerobic capacity/supramaximal work performed and aerobic capacity/peak aerobic power output, respectively. Results: No interaction or main effects were observed. Using indirect calorimetry, anaerobic capacity was not significantly different in either group pre- to postintervention using MAOD (IHT: 4% ± 15%; NORM: -5% ± 12%) or gross efficiency methods (IHT: 7% ± 14%; NORM: -2% ± 9%), and VO2peak was unchanged (IHT: 1% ± 6%; NORM: 1% ± 4%). However, within-group analysis shows that supramaximal work performed improved with IHT (14% ± 13%; p = 0.02; d = 0.42) but not NORM (1% ± 22%), and peak aerobic power output increased with IHT (5% ± 7%; p = 0.04; d = 0.32) but not NORM (2% ± 4%).

OBJECTIVES We sought to identify severe bronchiolitis profiles using a clustering approach and to investigate for the first time their association with allergy/inflammatory biomarkers, nasopharyngeal microbiota, and development of recurrent wheezing by age 3 years. METHODS We analyzed data from a prospective, 17-center US cohort study of 921 infants (age <1 year) hospitalized with bronchiolitis (2011-2014 winters) with posthospitalization follow-up. Severe bronchiolitis profiles at baseline (hospitalization) were determined by using latent class analysis based on clinical factors and viral etiology. Blood biomarkers and nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles were determined by using samples collected within 24 hours of hospitalization. Recurrent wheezing by age 3 years was defined based on parental report of breathing problem episodes after discharge. RESULTS Three severe bronchiolitis profiles were identified: profile A (15%), which was characterized by a history of breathing problems/eczema during infancy and non-respiratory syncytial virus (mostly rhinovirus) infection; profile B (49%), which has the largest probability of respiratory syncytial virus infection and resembled classic respiratory syncytial virus-induced bronchiolitis; and profile C (36%), which was composed of the most severely ill group. Profile A infants had higher eosinophil counts, higher cathelicidin levels, and increased proportions of Haemophilus-dominant or Moraxella-dominant microbiota profiles. Compared with profile B, we observed significantly increased risk of recurrent wheezing in children with profile A (hazard ratio, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.90-3.68) and, to a lesser extent, with profile C (hazard ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.14-2.01). CONCLUSION Although longer follow-up is needed, our results might help identify, among children hospitalized for bronchiolitis, subgroups with particularly increased risk of asthma.","Dumas, Orianne; Hasegawa, Kohei; Mansbach, Jonathan M; Sullivan, Ashley F; Piedra, Pedro A; Camargo, Carlos A",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,669,1

However, the thermal techniques require tumescent anaesthesia, which can be uncomfortable during administration. Non-tumescent, non-thermal techniques would, therefore, have potential benefits. This randomised controlled trial is being carried out to compare the degree of pain that patients experience while receiving mechanochemical ablation or radiofrequency ablation. The early results of this randomised controlled trial are reported here. METHODS Patients attending for the treatment of primary varicose veins were randomised to receive mechanochemical ablation (ClariVein®) or radiofrequency ablation (Covidien® Venefit™). The most symptomatic limb was randomised. The primary outcome measure was intra-procedural pain using a validated visual analogue scale. The secondary outcome measures were change in quality of life and clinical scores, time to return to normal activities and work as well as the occlusion rate. RESULTS One-hundred and nineteen patients have been randomised (60 in the mechanochemical ablation group). Baseline characteristics were similar. Maximum pain score was significantly lower in the mechanochemical ablation group (19.3 mm, standard deviation ±19 mm) compared to the radiofrequency ablation group (34.5 mm ± 23 mm; p < 0.001). Average pain score was also significantly lower in the mechanochemical ablation group (13.4 mm ± 16 mm) compared to the radiofrequency ablation group (24.4 mm ± 18 mm; p = 0.001). Sixty-six percent attended follow-up at one month, and the complete or proximal occlusion rates were 92% for both groups. At one month, the clinical and quality of life scores for both groups had similar improvements. CONCLUSION Early results show that the mechanochemical ablation is less painful than the radiofrequency ablation procedure. Clinical and quality of life scores were similarly improved at one month. The long-term data including occlusion rates at six months and quality of life scores are being collected.","Bootun, R; Lane, T R A; Dharmarajah, B; Lim, C S; Najem, M; Renton, S; Sritharan, K; Davies, A H",Phlebology,669,19

METHODS High-risk patients--body mass index (BMI) > 50 kg/m(2) with at least two major comorbidities: type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), hypertension--undergoing two-stage laparoscopic BPD-DS were retrospectively analysed. The SG pouch volume was 100-150 ml; in the second stage, the common channel and the alimentary loop were 100 cm and 150 cm, respectively. RESULTS Eighty-seven patients (50 female, 57.5%) underwent SG (two open). The mean age was 41.8 +/- 10.22 years with BMI of 55.2 +/- 6.69 kg/m(2). Four patients had Prader-Willy syndrome. Fourteen (16.46%) patients (6 female, 42.8%) had postoperative complications such as bleeding, fistula, pulmonary embolism, transitory acute renal failure, and abdominal abscess. One patient died at postoperative day 5 of pulmonary embolism. One patient was reoperated for hemoperitoneum by laparoscopy. The risk of complications after SG was lower in patients where reinforcement of the suture line was used (0.492), while it was higher in men (1.780). Neither difference was statistically significant [p = not significant (NS)]. After 9-24 months, 27 patients (BMI 43 +/- 8 kg/m(2)) underwent a second stage of BPD-DS (two open). Major postoperative complications were registered in eight patients (29.6%): three bleeding, four duodeno-ileal stenosis and one rhabdomyolysis. Two cases of internal hernia required laparoscopic reoperation. The reoperation rate was 1/85 (1.2%) after SG and 2/27 (7.4%) after second stage. CONCLUSIONS Complications after SG greatly decrease after the learning curve period and can be successfully managed without need of reoperation. Suture-line reinforcement, at least selectively in the middle-upper portion of the staple line and in super-super-obese patients, is recommended to decrease the incidence of specific complications.","Silecchia, G; Rizzello, M; Casella, G; Fioriti, M; Soricelli, E; Basso, N",Surgical endoscopy,669,1

Despite such phenomenal advances in medicinal applications, the clinical implication of native curcumin is hindered due to low solubility, physico-chemical instability, poor bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and poor pharmacokinetics. However, these issues can be overcome by utilizing an efficient delivery system. Active scientific research was initiated in 2005 to improve curcumin's pharmacokinetics, systemic bioavailability, and biological activity by encapsulating or by loading curcumin into nanoform(s) (nanoformulations). A significant number of nanoformulations exist that can be translated toward medicinal use upon successful completion of pre-clinical and human clinical trials. Considering this perspective, current review provides an overview of an efficient curcumin nanoformulation for a targeted therapeutic option for various human diseases. In this review article, we discuss the clinical evidence, current status, and future opportunities of curcumin nanoformulation(s) in the field of medicine. In addition, this review presents a concise summary of the actions required to develop curcumin nanoformulations as pharmaceutical or nutraceutical candidates.","Yallapu, Murali M; Nagesh, Prashanth K Bhusetty; Jaggi, Meena; Chauhan, Subhash C",The AAPS journal,669,14

A lesser-known cause of third nerve dysfunction is ischemia, often due to carotid artery dissection. CASE DESCRIPTION An 80-year-old man presented with an acute ischemic stroke with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of >20 from a high cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection and a tandem ICA terminus embolic occlusion with extension of clot into the adjacent fetal posterior cerebral artery (PCA). We used a stentriever to perform selective PCA thrombectomy, with immediate postthrombectomy development of ipsilateral anisocoria. The anisocoria progressed into complete oculomotor nerve palsy over 8 h after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS The clinical course described in this case is consistent with injury to the third nerve due to mechanical injury or occlusion of perforator supply to the nerve during thrombectomy. Oculomotor nerve palsy is a rare but known complication after ischemia; however, to our knowledge, this is the first case after thrombectomy for a PCA embolus.","Kogan, Michael; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Kim, Nina; Sawyer, Robert N; Snyder, Kenneth V; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Surgical neurology international,669,16

Here, we present a sensor, the Soil Water Profiler (SWaP), which can determine local soil water content (θ) with a precision of 6.10-5 cm3cm-3, an accuracy of 0.002 cm3cm-3, a temporal resolution of 24 minutes and a one-dimensional spatial resolution of 1 cm. The sensor comprises two copper sheets, integrated into a sleeve and connected to a coil, thereby forming a resonant circuit. A vector network analyzer, inductively coupled to the resonant circuit, measures the resonance frequency, against which θ was calibrated. The sensors were integrated into a positioning system, which measures θ along the depth of cylindrical tubes. When combined with modulating light (4-hour period) and resultant modulating plant transpiration, the SWaP enables quantification of the component of root water uptake distribution that varies proportionally with total plant water uptake, and distinguishes it from soil water redistribution via soil pores and roots. Additionally, as a young, growing maize (Zea mays) plant progressively tapped its soil environment dry, we observed clear changes in plant-driven root water uptake and soil water redistribution profiles. Our SWaP setup can measure the root water uptake and redistribution of sandy soil water content with unprecedented precision. The SWaP is therefore a promising device offering new insights into soil-plant hydrology, with applications for functional root phenotyping in non-saline, temperature controlled conditions, at low cost.","van Dusschoten, Dagmar; Kochs, Johannes; Kuppe, Christian; Sydoruk, Viktor A; Couvreur, Valentin; Pflugfelder, Daniel; Postma, Johannes A",Plant physiology,669,19

In the digital investigation, special techniques are required for grouping and screening electronic documents, because it is challenging to analyze relationships between numerous documents in storage devices manually. To this end, although techniques such as keyword search, similarity search, topic modeling, metadata analysis, and document clustering are continually being studied, there are still limitations for revealing the relevance of documents. Specifically, metadata used in previous research are not always values present in the documents, and clustering methods with specific keywords may be incomplete because text-based contents (including metadata) can be easily modified or deleted by users. In this work, we propose a novel method to efficiently group Microsoft Office Word 2007+ (MS Word) files by using revision identifier (RSID). Through a thorough understanding of the RSID, examiners can predict organizations to which a specific user belongs, and further, it is likely to discover unexpected interpersonal relationships. An experiment with a public dataset (GovDocs) provides that it is possible to categorize documents more effectively by combining our proposal with previously studied methods. Furthermore, we introduce a new document tracking method to understand the editing history and movement of a file, and then demonstrate its usefulness through an experiment with documents from a real case.","Joun, Jihun; Chung, Hyunji; Park, Jungheum; Lee, Sangjin",Journal of forensic sciences,669,7

Isolation, scarcity of resources and the lack of social contacts may have produced a negative impact on people's emotions and psychological well-being. This study aims to explore the reasons and the ways through which social distancing generates negative emotions in individuals who experienced the lockdown. To a larger extent, the objective is to check the existence of relations between negative emotions and the satisfaction of basic needs. MATERIALS AND METHODS In Italy 140,656 online interviews were collected from March 22 to April 2, 2020. Data analysis was carried out using mono and bivariate statistical analysis, K-means clustering and the Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The parameters for the identification of six clusters were: the intensity of the respondent's basic emotions and the layers of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. RESULTS The majority of people involved in an emergency situation, implying a collapse of social contacts, experience some kind of emotional reactions. In our study, we found a correlation between basic emotions and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In times of crisis, the most basic needs are the physiological ones. Fear, anger and sadness are predominant in all population groups; anger and disgust mainly appear when people are exposed to the risk of not being able to meet subsistence needs, thus perceiving a lack of economic security. CONCLUSIONS The well-known Maslow's theory of human needs seems to fit well with the outbreak of negative emotions in the context of COVID-19. This study demonstrates the existence of links between negative emotions and primary needs that mainly refer to the first three levels of Maslow's pyramid. As a result of COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, many people have been sucked into the bottom layers of the pyramid. This change in individual basic needs has triggered a relevant transformation in individual emotional status and a shift towards negative emotions.","Cerbara, L; Ciancimino, G; Crescimbene, M; La Longa, F; Parsi, M R; Tintori, A; Palomba, R",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,669,19

BACKGROUND A prior study presented a human operator model to predict human steering performance in the teleoperation of a passenger-sized UGV at constant speeds. To enable applications to varying speed scenarios, the model needs to be extended to incorporate speed control and be able to predict human performance under the effect of accelerations/decelerations and various time delays induced by the teleoperation setting. A strategy is also needed to parameterize the model without human subject data for a truly predictive capability. METHOD This paper adopts the ACT-R cognitive architecture and two-point steering model used in the previous work, and extends the model by incorporating a far-point speed control model to allow for varying speed. A parameterization strategy is proposed to find a robust set of parameters for each time delay to maximize steering performance. Human subject experiments are conducted to validate the model. RESULTS Results show that the parameterized model can predict both the trend of average lane keeping error and its lowest value for human subjects under different time delays. CONCLUSIONS The proposed model successfully extends the prior computational model to predict human steering behavior in a teleoperated UGV with varying speed. APPLICATION This computational model can be used to substitute for human operators in the process of development and testing of teleoperated UGV technologies and allows fully simulation-based development and studies.","Li, Chen; Tang, Yue; Zheng, Yingshi; Jayakumar, Paramsothy; Ersal, Tulga",Human factors,669,1

Single-stage bridging reconstructions have been reported, however, with high rates of recurrence and wound complications. We describe a single-surgeon experience with bridging biologic CVH repair. METHODS We reviewed 37 patients undergoing CVH repair with bridging biologic mesh by the senior author from January 1, 2007 to January 1, 2013. Surgical history and operative characteristics were analyzed for predictors of hernia recurrence and wound complications. RESULTS Average age was 53 ± 15 years, body mass index was 31.1 ± 8.1 kg/m(2), and history of prior repair in 18 patients. Common indications were trauma, intra-abdominal infection, and prior intra-abdominal surgery. Incidence of wound complications was 51.4%, most commonly wound breakdown and infection. With average follow-up of 13 months, recurrence rate was 18.9% at an average of 8.2 months postoperatively. Analysis demonstrated postoperative wound infection as the only predictor of recurrence (odds ratio = 22.1, P = .017). CONCLUSIONS Hernia recurrence rate was 18.9% with bridged biologic CVH repairs, strongly associated with postoperative wound infection. This suggests that patients with postoperative infections may benefit from closer surveillance and more aggressive wound management.","Basta, Marten N; Fischer, John P; Kovach, Stephen J",American journal of surgery,669,1

METHODS Design/setting: internet-based, cross-sectional survey conducted in the Netherlands from July to October 2017. PARTICIPANTS 32 748 women aged 15-45 years, recruited through social media. OUTCOME MEASURES self-reported lost productivity in days, divided into absenteeism and presenteeism; impact of menstrual symptoms; reasons women give when calling in sick; and women's preferences regarding the implications of menstruation-related symptoms for schools and workplaces. RESULTS A total of 13.8% (n=4514) of all women reported absenteeism during their menstrual periods with 3.4% (n=1108) reporting absenteeism every or almost every menstrual cycle. The mean absenteeism related to a woman's period was 1.3 days per year. A total of 80.7% (n=26 438) of the respondents reported presenteeism and decreased productivity a mean of 23.2 days per year. An average productivity loss of 33% resulted in a mean of 8.9 days of total lost productivity per year due to presenteeism. Women under 21 years were more likely to report absenteeism due to menstruation-related symptoms (OR 3.3, 95% CI 3.1 to 3.6). When women called in sick due to their periods, only 20.1% (n=908) told their employer or school that their absence was due to menstrual complaints. Notably, 67.7% (n=22 154) of the participants wished they had greater flexibility in their tasks and working hours at work or school during their periods. CONCLUSIONS Menstruation-related symptoms cause a great deal of lost productivity, and presenteeism is a bigger contributor to this than absenteeism. There is an urgent need for more focus on the impact of these symptoms, especially in women aged under 21 years, for discussions of treatment options with women of all ages and, ideally, more flexibility for women who work or go to school.","Schoep, Mark E; Adang, Eddy M M; Maas, Jacques W M; De Bie, Bianca; Aarts, Johanna W M; Nieboer, Theodoor E",BMJ open,669,7

However, an unpredictably small graft diameter has been a drawback of this technique. Smaller graft diameter has been associated with increased risk of revision, and increasing the number of strands has been reported as a successful technique to increase the graft diameter. Purpose To compare failure rates of 5-strand (5HS) and 6-strand (6HS) hamstring autograft compared with conventional 4-strand (4HS) hamstring autograft. We describe the technique in detail, supplemented by photographs and illustrations, to provide a reproducible technique to avoid the variable and often insufficient 4HS graft diameter reported in the literature. Study Design Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods We retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data of all primary hamstring autograft ACLRs performed at our institution with a minimum 2-year follow-up and 8.0-mm graft diameter. A total of 413 consecutive knees met the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study population was divided into 5HS and 6HS groups as well as a 4HS control group. The primary outcome was failure of ACLR, defined as persistent or recurrent instability and/or revision ACLR. Results The analysis included 224, 156, and 33 knees in the 5HS, 6HS, and 4HS groups, respectively. The overall ACLR failure rate in this study was 11 cases (8%): 5 cases for 5HS, 3 cases for 6HS, and 3 cases for 4HS. No statistically significant differences were found among groups (P = .06). The mean graft diameter was 9 mm, and the mean follow-up was 44.27 months. Conclusion The 5HS and 6HS constructs have similar failure rates to the conventional 4HS construct of 8.0-mm diameter and are therefore safe and reliable to increase the diameter of relatively smaller hamstring autografts. We strongly recommend using this technique when the length of the tendons permits to avoid failures reportedly associated with inadequate graft size.","Attia, Ahmed Khalil; Nasef, Hazem; ElSweify, Kareem Hussein; Adam, Mohammed A; AbuShaaban, Faris; Arun, Kariyal",Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,669,29

This strategy was first used in Mexico by the Catholic Church and many Catholic universities. Advocates, scientists, and feminist organizations, as well as some public universities, have also realized that a grounding in bioethics could help health providers to have an ethical frame that supports the provision of abortion services. Bioethics is also a good framework for supporting the legalization of abortion and for more liberal laws regarding assisted reproduction.

In parallel, the beneficial effect of a high omega-3 PUFA diet on infarct size can be attenuated by increased omega-6 PUFA consumption. The present study was designed to determine if augmented linoleic acid (LA), an omega-6 PUFA administered at the same time, attenuates the cardioprotective action of RvD1. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received 0.1μg RvD1 alone or with one of three LA doses (1, 5 or 10μg) directly into the left ventricle chamber 5min before ischemia. The animals underwent 40min of ischemia by occlusion of the left descending coronary artery followed by 30min or 24h of reperfusion. Infarct size and neutrophil accumulation were evaluated after 24h of reperfusion, while caspase-3, -8 and -9 and Akt activities were assessed at 30min of reperfusion. LA attenuated cardioprotection afforded by RvD1, resulting in significantly increased infarct size. Neutrophil accumulation and Akt activity were similar between groups. Caspase activities, especially caspase-9, which could be activated by ischemia, were stimulated in the presence of LA, suggesting that this omega-6 PUFA accentuates ischemia intensity. The present results indicate that LA significantly attenuates the beneficial effect of RvD1 on infarct size. Therefore, reduction of omega-6 intake should be considered to maintain the protection afforded by RvD1.","Gilbert, Kim; Malick, Mandy; Madingou, Ness; Bourque-Riel, Valérie; Touchette, Charles; Rousseau, Guy",The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,669,1

Despite obvious short-term clinical benefit, long-term social impact and cost-effectiveness have not been fully investigated. AIM Predictive modeling of long-term clinical and social outcomes and the cost-effectiveness analysis of blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring and remote counseling (BPTM) in patients with HTN. MATERIALS AND METHODS A Markov cohort-based (1000 patients in each study arm) model was developed and adopted a 10-year time horizon with 12-month time cycles. Cost and outcome data collected from the three-month study of 240 patients (160 in BPTM group and 80 controls, 48 y.o.). All patients started at a non-complicated HTN well state with a certain possibility of disease progression in a number of health states over a discrete time period. BPTM was compared with usual care in terms of 10-year healthcare costs, quality adjusted life years (QALY) using a Ministry of Health of Russian Federation perspective. RESULTS In the long-term run when compared with usual care BPTM was more effective in terms mortality (67 versus 91 patients lost and 9.6 versus 9.71 life years gained) and costs (cost of illness 102 508 000 RUR versus 145 237 700 RUR). Taking quality of life measures into account, the effect of BPTM was also more pronounced (8.31 versus 7.82 QALYs gained). The resultant incremental cost-utility ratio for BPTM was 275 178.98 RUR/1 QALY gained/1 patient (134 837.70 RUR/0.49 QALY/1 patient). CONCLUSION According to the results of predictive modeling, implementation of BPTM into clinical practice is likely lead to reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a cost-effective way.","Ionov, M V; Zhukova, O V; Zvartau, N E; Konradi, A O",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,669,7

Distribution of pancreatic thickness was used to find the cut-off point of thickness which predicts POPF according to stapler groups.POPF developed in 130 (59.9%) patients (Grade A; n = 86 [66.1%], B; n = 44 [33.8%]). The numbers in each stapler group were 46, 101, and 70, respectively. Mean thickness was higher in POPF cases (15.2 mm vs 13.5 mm, P = 0.002). High body mass index (P = 0.003), thick pancreas (P = 0.011), and high CR (P = 0.024) were independent risk factors for POPF in multivariate analysis. Pancreatic thickness was grouped into <12 mm, 12 to 17 mm, and >17 mm. With pancreatic thickness <12 mm, the POPF rate was lowest with Group II (I: 50%, II: 27.6%, III: 69.2%, P = 0.035).The optimal stapler cartridges with pancreatic thickness <12 mm were those in Group II (Gold, CL: 1.8 mm). There was no suitable cartridge for thicker pancreases. Further studies are necessary to reduce POPF in thick pancreases.","Kim, Hongbeom; Jang, Jin-Young; Son, Donghee; Lee, Seungyeoun; Han, Youngmin; Shin, Yong Chan; Kim, Jae Ri; Kwon, Wooil; Kim, Sun-Whe",Medicine,669,28

Sarcocysts are formed in the muscles or central nervous system of the intermediate host (IH), while sporocysts develop in the small intestine of the definitive host (DH). Various birds of prey have been confirmed to be DH for Sarcocystis spp. Three Sarcocystis species, S. wobeseri, S. halieti and S. falcatula, have been identified in the muscles of birds of prey, of which the latter are known to be pathogenic and can cause encephalitis in various birds. The aim of this study was to identify Sarcocystis spp. in the muscles of birds of prey from Spain. METHODS Between 2019 and 2020, muscle tissue samples taken from 59 birds of prey admitted to the Wildlife Recovery Centre in Ilundain (Navarra, Spain) were examined for the presence of Sarcocystis spp. Sarcocysts in fresh squashed samples were morphologically characterized under the light microscope (LM). Sarcocystis spp. were identified by means of 28S ribosomal RNA and internal transcribed spacer 1 sequence analysis. RESULTS Microscopic examination of squashed tissue samples stained with methylene blue revealed the presence of sarcocysts in three of the 59 (5.1%) birds examined. Only one sarcocyst type was observed under the LM. Sarcocysts were thread-like (1050-2160 × 130-158 μm) and had a thin (0.7-1.4 μm) and smooth cyst wall. Septa divided the cysts into compartments filled with banana-shaped (5.9 × 1.7 μm) bradyzoites. On the basis of DNA sequence results, S. halieti was identified in the western marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and the black kite (Milvus migrans) for the first time. Sarcocysts of S. halieti were shorter and wider compared to those observed in the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and the herring gull (Larus argentatus). According to current knowledge, S. halieti may infect birds belonging to four different orders: Suliformes, Charadriiformes, Strigiformes and Accipitriformes. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report of S. halieti in the western marsh harrier and the black kite as IH. So far, little research has been conducted on birds of prey as IH for Sarcocystis spp. These results indicate that further studies combining morphological, histopathological, and molecular methods are required.","Prakas, Petras; Bea, Antonio; Juozaitytė-Ngugu, Evelina; Olano, Iñaki; Villanúa, Diego; Švažas, Saulius; Butkauskas, Dalius",Parasites & vectors,669,30

This surge created the need for anesthesia services to expand to these areas to provide well tolerated and favorable procedural conditions. The present review describes nonoperating room anesthesia patterns in different parts of the world. RECENT FINDINGS Nonoperating room anesthesia has grown exponentially over the last years. Patients scheduled in these areas are sicker and older compared to the operating room patients. Anesthesiologist-directed care has proven to be well tolerated, with less serious complications and improvement in patients and proceduralist satisfaction. SUMMARY There are marked variations in how anesthesia services are delivered in out of operating room locations in different parts of the world. Although there are some data available from the United States, expansion of minimally invasive procedures across continents will likely lead to the emergence of various models of delivering anesthetic care.","Fernandez-Robles, Claudia; Oprea, Adriana D",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,669,1

METHODS A questionnaire was developed by a review of relevant literature and sports-related questionnaires, and input from five experienced sports dietitians. Item construct and format was adapted and modified from a previous questionnaire. The modified questionnaire sought information on demographics, nutrition knowledge, beliefs, intended practices, information sources and exercise-associated gastrointestinal symptoms. A five-phase validity process was conducted to determine content, face and construct validity, item difficulty and internal reliability of the questionnaire. The Delphi technique was applied with experts over three anonymous rounds. Items were reviewed to determine whether to keep, modify, or delete, rate the relevance of each item using a content validity index (CVI), and provide comments. A content analysis was conducted on all comments after each round. Online interviews were conducted with a pilot group of endurance athletes (n = 15) to assess item difficulty and feasibility. Nutrition knowledge was compared between pilot group of athletes and experts to determine construct validity and internal consistency. A test-retest process was applied to a second pilot group (n = 8) to verify questionnaire reliability. RESULTS High CVI (≥.83) and agreement scores were obtained through the Delphi technique. High reliability (r = .942) and acceptable internal consistency (α = .53-.78) of the questionnaire were obtained.

It can be complicated not only by diverticulitis, but by hemorrhage, perforation, intussusception, volvulus, malabsorption and even small bowel obstruction due to enteroliths formed and expelled from these diverticula. METHODS We describe a case of an occult bleeding jejunal diverticulum, casually discovered in a patient that was taken to surgery for a Dieulafoy's lesion after unsuccessful endoscopic treatment. We performed a gastric resection together with an ileocecal resection.Macroscopic and microscopic examinations confirmed the gastric Dieulafoy's lesion and demonstrated the presence of another source of occult bleeding in asymptomatic jejunal diverticulum. DISCUSSION The current case emphasizes that some gastrointestinal bleeding lesions, although rare, can be multiple and result in potentially life-threatening bleeding. The clinician must be mindful to the possibility of multisite lesions and to the correlation between results of the investigations and clinical condition of the bleeding patient.","Orlando, G; Luppino, I M; Gervasi, R; Lerose, M A; Amato, B; Spagnuolo, R; Marasco, R; Doldo, P; Puzziello, A",BMC surgery,669,31

PubMed was searched multiple times prior to manuscript submissions and revisions, using virus, viral, proteomics; in combination with each keyword. The most recent examples of published works from each search were then analyzed. EXPERT OPINION There has been exponential growth in numbers and types of proteomic analyses in recent years. Continued development of reagents that allow increased multi-plexing and deeper proteomic probing of the cell, at quantitative and functional levels, enhancements that target more important protein modifications, and improved bioinformatics software tools and pathway prediction algorithms will accelerate this growth and usher in a new era of host proteome understanding.","Coombs, Kevin M",Expert review of proteomics,669,1

To better understand the composition of these inequalities and inform planning after the pandemic, we undertook a decomposition of life expectancy inequalities between the most and least deprived quintiles for men and women by age and cause of death and explored trends between 2002 and 2018. STUDY DESIGN Statistical decomposition of life expectancy inequalities by age and cause of death using routine population mortality datasets. METHODS We used routine statistics from the Office for National Statistics for the period 2002-2018 on population and deaths in Wales stratified by age, gender, Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) 2019 quintile and cause of death, categorised by International Classification of Disease, version 10, code into 15 categories of public health relevance. We aggregated data to 3-year rolling figures to account for low numbers of events in some groups annually. Next, we estimated life expectancy at birth by quintile, gender and period using life table methods. Lastly, we performed a decomposition analysis using the Arriaga method to identify the specific disease categories and ages at which excess deaths occur in more disadvantaged areas to highlight potential areas for action. RESULTS Life expectancy inequalities between the most and least WIMD quintiles rose for both genders between 2002 and 2018: from 4.69 to 6.02 years for women (an increase of 1.33 years) and from 6.34 to 7.42 years for men (an increase of 1.08 years). Exploratory analysis of these trends suggested that the following were most influential for women: respiratory disease (1.50 years), cancers (1.36 years), circulatory disease (1.35 years) and digestive disease (0.51 years). For men, the gap was driven by circulatory disease (2.01 years), cancers (1.39 years), respiratory disease (1.25 years), digestive disease (0.79 years), drug- and alcohol-related conditions (0.54 years) and external causes (0.54 years). Contributions for women from respiratory disease, cancers, dementia and drug- and alcohol-related conditions appeared to be increasing, while among men, there were rising contributions from respiratory, digestive and circulatory disease. CONCLUSIONS Life expectancy inequalities in Wales remain wide and have been increasing, particularly among women, with indications of worsening trends since 2010 following the introduction of fiscal austerity. As agencies recover from the pandemic, these findings should be considered alongside any resumption of services in Wales or future health and public policy.","Currie, J; Boyce, T; Evans, L; Luker, M; Senior, S; Hartt, M; Cottrell, S; Lester, N; Huws, D; Humphreys, C; Little, K; Adekanmbi, V; Paranjothy, S",Public health,669,29

However, the disaster risk reduction strategy in the Saudi health care system appears to be a reactive approach focused more on flood hazards than other threats. Given the current unstable political situation in its neighboring countries and Saudi Arabia's key role in providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to those affected by internal conflicts and wars, it is essential to develop a framework for training standards related to complex humanitarian disasters to provide the requisite skills and knowledge in a gradual manner, according to local context and international standards. This framework could also support the World Health Organization's (WHO; Geneva, Switzerland) initiative for establishing a national disaster assistance team in Saudi Arabia. PROBLEM The main aim of this study is to provide Saudi health care providers with a competencies-based course in Basic Principles of Complex Humanitarian Emergency. METHODS The interactive, competencies-based course in Basic Principles of Complex Humanitarian Emergency was designed by five experts in disaster medicine and humanitarian relief in three stages, accordance to international standards and the local context. The course was piloted over five days at the Officers Club of the Ministry of Interior (MOI; Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). The 33 participants were from different health disciplines of the government sectors in-country. The participants completed the pre- and post-tests and attended three pilot workshops for disaster community awareness. RESULTS The overall knowledge scores were significantly higher in the post-test (62.9%) than the pre-test (44.2%). There were no significant differences in the pre- and post-knowledge scores for health care providers from the different government health disciplines. A 10-month, post-event survey demonstrated that participants were satisfied with their knowledge retention. Importantly, three of them (16.6%) had the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice in relation to humanitarian aid response. CONCLUSION Delivering a competencies-based course in Basic Principles of Complex Humanitarian Emergency for health care providers can help improve their knowledge and skills for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, which is crucial for disaster preparedness augmentation in Saudi Arabia.","Bajow, Nidaa A; Alawad, Yousef I; Aloraifi, Samer M",Prehospital and disaster medicine,669,24

Based on the observation that human optimization of RNA virus gene fragments may abolish their ability to stimulate the type I interferon (IFN-I) response, we identified the most biased sequences along the SIV genome and showed that they are the most potent IFN-I stimulators. With the aim of designing an attenuated SIV genome based on a reduced capacity to activate the IFN-I response, we synthesized artificial SIV genomes whose biased sequences were optimized toward macaque average nucleotide composition without altering their regulatory elements or amino acid sequences. A synthetic SIV optimized with 169 synonymous mutations in gag and pol genes showed a 100-fold decrease in replicative capacity. Interestingly, a synthetic SIV optimized with 70 synonymous mutations in pol had a normal replicative capacity. Its ability to stimulate IFN-I was reduced when infected cells were cocultured with reporter cells. IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) transcription factor was required for IFN-I stimulation, implicating cytosolic sensors in the detection of SIV-biased RNA in infected cells. No reversion of introduced mutations was observed for either of the optimized viruses after 10 serial passages. In conclusion, we have designed large-scale nucleotide-modified SIVs that may display attenuated pathogenic potential. IMPORTANCE In this study, we synthesized artificial SIV genomes in which the most hyperbiased sequences were optimized to bring them closer to the nucleotide composition of the macaque SIV host. Interestingly, we generated a stable synthetic SIV optimized with 70 synonymous mutations in pol gene, which had a normal replicative capacity but a reduced ability to stimulate type I IFN. This demonstrates the possibility to rationally change viral nucleotide composition to design replicative and genetically stable lentiviruses with attenuated pathogenic potentials.","Vabret, Nicolas; Bailly-Bechet, Marc; Lepelley, Alice; Najburg, Valérie; Schwartz, Olivier; Verrier, Bernard; Tangy, Frédéric",Journal of virology,669,12

In Japan, a state of emergency was declared on April 7, 2020, which had a significant impact on the life of citizens. This study focused on behaviors like avoiding going out or coming in contact with others and frequent hand-washing to prevent the infection and the spread of COVID-19 among people living in Tokyo. We also examined the factors associated with these behaviors during the declaration of emergency.Methods An online survey was conducted from April 26 to 29, 2020, approximately 20 days after the declaration of the emergency, among men and women aged 20-69 years living in Tokyo. The study framework was based on the protection motivation theory, which explains the risk-reducing behaviors, and focus theory of normative conduct, which explains the effect of others' behavior on one's own behavior. The frequency of behaviors like avoiding going out or coming in contact with others and frequent hand-washing, as well as the perception of the risk of COVID-19 during the week preceding the survey, were assessed. Each preventive action was evaluated based on the following factors: perceived effectiveness (response efficacy), perceived practicability (self-efficacy), necessary cost (response cost), and perceptions of how much should be done (injunctive norm) and how well others are doing it (descriptive norm). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis with these behaviors as outcomes were performed.Results This study included 1,034 participants (50.3% male, mean age 44.82 years, standard deviation 14.00 years). The analyses of the frequency of avoiding going out or coming in contact with others showed that the injunctive norm was positively associated with the behavior (standardized partial regression coefficient (β)=0.343, P<0.001), while the descriptive norm was negatively associated with the behavior (β=-0.074, P=0.010). Furthermore, the two-way interaction between risk perception, response efficacy, and self-efficacy was significant (β=0.129, P<0.001), indicating that risk perception was positively associated with the behavior only when either response efficacy or self-efficacy was low. A similar analysis conducted for hand-washing behavior revealed that injunctive norm (β=0.256, P<0.001) and response efficacy (β=0.132, P<0.001) were positively associated with the behavior, while the response cost (β=-0.193, P<0.001) was negatively associated with the behavior.Conclusion Some variables in the protection motivation theory and the focus theory of normative conduct were related to the behavior for the prevention of COVID-19. The results suggest that the application of these theories is useful in future studies.","Higuchi, Masataka; Arai, Hirokazu; Ito, Taku; Nakamura, Nanako; Kai, Yuko",[Nihon koshu eisei zasshi] Japanese journal of public health,669,31

PURPOSE A case of uncontrolled hypertension nonresponsive to traditional pharmacologic management in a pediatric patient with a ventricular assist device awaiting a heart transplant is reported. SUMMARY A 4-month-old male in heart failure was experiencing uncontrolled hypertension. Because of a lack of hemodynamic stability, he was unable to be listed as a heart transplant candidate. He received multiple antihypertensive agents (calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, and direct-acting vasodilators) as both intermittent and continuous infusions over the course of several days without achieving normotension. The decision was then made to administer intravenous phentolamine as a continuous infusion to pursue a different mechanism than with traditional antihypertensive agents to achieve hemodynamic stability. Within 8 hours of initiation of the continuous phentolamine infusion, the patient became normotensive and was listed for a heart transplant. The continuous phentolamine infusion was administered over the next 4 days to maintain normotension, and on day 4 the patient underwent successful orthotopic heart transplantation. CONCLUSION A 4-month-old male in heart failure with a ventricular assist device, experiencing uncontrolled hypertension nonresponsive to traditional pharmacologic management, was successfully treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of phentolamine.","Hatt, Andrew",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,669,1

In this simulator, we first reconstruct the three-dimension (3D) model of human brains for tissue/instrument interaction. Then a preoperative planning method based on geometry analysis is introduced to find the feasible entry point of LVP operation. A hierarchical bounding-box collision detection approach is proposed to render haptic feedback that is transferred to humans. Finally, a set of experiments on the proposed simulator and 3D printed models of human brains is carried out.

The results indicated that the cotton rat species, S. hispidus and S. fulviventer, were not a useful model for either SARS-CoV infection or disease. This observation was supported by the absence of any signs of illness, the failure to consistently demonstrate virus in the blood and tissues, and the absent of any notable histopathology. However, infected animals were capable of producing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV, suggesting the seroconversion did occur. Further studies are warranted to consider other animal species in efforts to find better animal models for the evaluation of SARS-CoV vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Watts, D M; Peters, C J; Newman, P; Wang, N; Yoshikawa, N; Tseng, C K; Wyde, P R",Vector borne and zoonotic diseases,669,1

The on-line system was versatile, only different monoclonal antibodies, anti-apolipoprotein B-100, anti-CD9, or anti-CD61, were immobilized on monolithic disk columns for isolation of lipoproteins and extracellular vesicles (EVs). The platelet-derived CD61- positive EVs and CD9- positive EVs, isolated by IAC, were further fractionated by AsFlFFF to their size-based subpopulations (e.g. exomeres and exosomes) for further analysis. Field-emission scanning electron microscope elucidated the morphology of the subpopulations, and 20 free amino acids and glucose in EV subpopulations were identified and quantified in ng/mL range using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS). The study revealed that there were significant differences between EV origin and size based subpopulations. The on-line coupled IAC-AsFlFFF system was successfully programmed for reliable execution of 10 sequential isolation and fractionation cycles (37-80 min per cycle) with minimal operator involvement, minimal sample losses, and contamination. The relative standard deviations (RSD) between the cycles for human plasma samples were 0.84-6.6%.","Multia, Evgen; Liangsupree, Thanaporn; Jussila, Matti; Ruiz-Jimenez, Jose; Kemell, Marianna; Riekkola, Marja-Liisa",Analytical chemistry,669,1

Analyses of host defense have focused on the lungs and the respiratory epithelium. Spontaneously inhaled murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) instead infect the olfactory epithelium, where neuronal cilia are exposed to environmental antigens and provide a route across the epithelial mucus. We used MuHV-4 to define how B cells respond to virus replication in this less well-characterized site. Olfactory infection elicited generally weaker acute responses than lung infection, particularly in the spleen, reflecting slower viral replication and spread. Few virus-specific antibody-forming cells (AFCs) were found in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), a prominent response site for respiratory epithelial infection. Instead, they appeared first in the superficial cervical lymph nodes. The focus of the AFC response then moved to the spleen, matching the geography of virus dissemination. Little virus-specific IgA response was detected until later in the bone marrow. Neuroepithelial HSV-1 infection also elicited no significant AFC response in the NALT and a weak IgA response. Thus, olfactory herpesvirus infection differed immunologically from an infection of the adjacent respiratory epithelium. Poor IgA induction may help herpesviruses to transmit via long-term mucosal shedding. IMPORTANCE Herpesviruses are widespread, persistent pathogens against which vaccines have had limited success. We need to understand better how they interact with host immunity. MuHV-4 and HSV-1 inhaled by alert mice infect the olfactory neuroepithelium, suggesting that this is a natural entry route. Its immunology is almost completely unknown. The antibody response to neuroepithelial herpesvirus infection started in the cervical lymph nodes, and unlike respiratory influenza virus infection, did not significantly involve the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue. MuHV-4 and HSV-1 infections also elicited little virus-specific IgA. Therefore, vaccine-induced IgA might provide a defense that herpesviruses are ill-equipped to meet.","Tan, Cindy S E; Stevenson, Philip G",Journal of virology,669,23

The consequences of stigma are worse for racial and/or ethnic minorities compared to racial and/or ethnic majorities since the former often experience other social adversities such as poverty and discrimination within policies and institutions. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing the evidence on the impact of differences in mental illness stigma between racial minorities and majorities. METHODS This systematic review and meta-analysis included cross-sectional studies comparing mental illness stigma between racial minorities and majorities. Systematic searches were conducted in the bibliographic databases of PubMed, PsycINFO and EMBASE until 20th December 2018. Outcomes were extracted from published reports, and meta-analyses, and meta-regression analyses were conducted in CMA software. RESULTS After screening 2787 abstracts, 29 studies with 193,418 participants (N = 35,836 in racial minorities) were eligible for analyses. Racial minorities showed more stigma than racial majorities (g = 0.20 (95% CI: 0.12 ~ 0.27) for common mental disorders. Sensitivity analyses showed robustness of these results. Multivariate meta-regression analyses pointed to the possible moderating role of the number of studies with high risk of bias on the effect size. Racial minorities have more stigma for common mental disorders when compared with majorities. Limitations included moderate to high risk of bias, high heterogeneity, few studies in most comparisons, and the use of non-standardized outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS Mental illness stigma is higher among ethnic minorities than majorities. An important clinical implication of these findings would be to tailor anti-stigma strategies related with mental illnesses according to specific racial and/or ethnic backgrounds with the intention to improve mental health outreach.","Eylem, Ozlem; de Wit, Leonore; van Straten, Annemieke; Steubl, Lena; Melissourgaki, Zaneta; Danışman, Gözde Topgüloğlu; de Vries, Ralph; Kerkhof, Ad J F M; Bhui, Kamaldeep; Cuijpers, Pim",BMC public health,669,29

The aim of the study is to evaluate the outcomes, which are related with surgical technique after total laparoscopic right colectomy (TLRC) and laparoscopic-assisted right colectomy (LARC) for right colon cancer in 30 consecutive patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty patients with right colon cancer, half of which were treated with TLRC and half of which were treated with LARC, were compared with regard to patient demographics, operative and postoperative data, histopathologic findings, follow-up data, and the complications related to the surgical technique. RESULTS There were 16 men and 14 women, median age was 63 years (range 41-86) with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m2 (range 20-33). There were no differences between the groups for BMI, harvested lymph node number, or distal and radial margins. The length of the incision and the length of the postoperative stay was shorter in the TLRC group (p=0.000). Overall complications were higher in the LARC group than in the TLRC group (p=0.014). The median follow-up was 28 months (range 5-99). In the late period, two patients in the LARC group were reoperated on. The cause of reoperation was internal herniation in one patient due to ileal twisting and incisional hernia in the other one. CONCLUSION Our preliminary data indicate that TLRC could result in better outcomes for right colon cancer patients than LARC.","Erguner, Ilknur; Aytac, Erman; Baca, Bilgi; Hamzaoglu, Ismail; Karahasanoglu, Tayfun",Asian journal of surgery,669,26

We sought to define the etiology, clinical presentation, time course and outcomes of children presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with cutaneous manifestations shortly after the first pandemic peak of COVID-19 in Spain. METHODS Prospective, observational study in children <15 years of age evaluated for skin lesions in the ED of three pediatric hospitals. Children underwent a comprehensive work-up including SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and PCR, and serology and PCR tests for other viruses and bacteria. A one-month follow-up visit was conducted. RESULTS From April 14 through May 8, 2020 we enrolled 62 children. Of those 34 had acro-ischemic skin lesions and 28 a variety of skin rashes. Overall 40% of children had mild systemic symptoms. Children with chilblains were older, had pain more frequently and more prolonged duration of skin lesions, while those with non-specific rashes had fever more frequently. Lesions were resolved in 75% of children at follow-up. Five patients demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and none tested positive by PCR. Three additional patients tested positive by PCR for rhinovirus, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS The number of ED visits for chilblains, which are rare in pediatrics, was high soon after the first peak of COVID-19 in Spain. The disease course was self-limited, outcomes were favorable and the possibility of viral transmission was negligible as all patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR.","Oliva Rodríguez-Pastor, Silvia; Martín Pedraz, Laura; Carazo Gallego, Begoña; Galindo Zavala, Rocío; Lozano Sánchez, Gema; de Toro Pseinado, Inmaculada; Rodriguez Benjumea, Margarita; Mejias, Asuncion; Cuadros, Esmeralda Núñez",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,669,16

Hence, we modified the scanning method and position, and evaluated the efficacy of this alternative scanning technique in pediatric cases. We evaluated the gastric contents of 44 pediatric patients aged 4-14 years who were about to undergo elective surgery. Solid food and fluids were prohibited 8 and 2 h before anesthesia, respectively. Before anesthetic induction, we used gastric ultrasonography to measure the antral cross-sectional area in the supine position (supine CSA), irrespective of peristaltic contractions. The gastric volume was then aspirated using a multi-orifice catheter under general anesthesia. Supine CSA measured via this gastric ultrasonography method was positively correlated with gastric volume (r = 0.56, p < 0.0001). We concluded that our alternative method of measuring antral CSA may be applicable for children minimal gastric contents.","Fukunaga, Chikako; Sugita, Michiko; Yamamoto, Tatsuo",Journal of anesthesia,669,16

While routine postoperative duplex ultrasound surveillance can be used for early detection, the optimal timing is unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence and progression of asymptomatic PSVT 1 week and 1 month after LS. METHODS Consecutive patients scheduled for LS for hematologic disease participated in this study. Patients underwent surveillance for PSVT using duplex ultrasonography 1 week and 1 month postoperatively. RESULTS 43 of 48 patients planning to undergo LS in the study period were enrolled, with 3 subsequently excluded, leaving 40 for further analysis. The indications for LS were benign disease in 31 [19 had immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP)] and malignant disease in 9. A hand-assisted technique was used in 12 cases. PSVT was diagnosed in 9/40 patients (22.5%). Seven (77.8%) were diagnosed by 1 week with ultrasound, of whom one had mild symptoms (fever and diarrhea). After anticoagulation, subsequent ultrasounds showed resolution or improvement in all seven patients. Thirty-three patients had a normal ultrasound result at 1 week. One of these patients also had a computed tomography (CT) scan that found a PSVT not seen on ultrasound. Twenty-seven patients returned for follow-up after normal 1-week imaging: 26 patients had an ultrasound at 1 month, with no new PSVT found. One additional patient did not return for subsequent ultrasound until 2 months later, when a new distal SVT was found; ultrasound at 6 months showed complete resolution without treatment. CONCLUSION The 1-week incidence of PSVT after LS was 8/40 (20%). The high incidence justifies ultrasonographic screening on postoperative day 7. If asymptomatic PSVT has not developed at this time, it is unlikely to develop by 1 month, and subsequent screening ultrasound at 1 month is not required.","Tran, Tung; Demyttenaere, Sebastian V; Polyhronopoulos, Gerry; Séguin, Chantal; Artho, Giovanni P; Kaneva, Pepa; Fried, Gerald M; Feldman, Liane S",Surgical endoscopy,669,33

Included participants were employed or self-employed at baseline, alive and aged <65 years in 2020. Poisson regression models were adjusted sequentially for baseline demographic, socioeconomic, work-related, health, and lifestyle-related risk factors to assess risk ratios (RRs) for testing positive in hospital or death due to COVID-19 by three occupational classification schemes (including Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) 2000). RESULTS Of 120 075 participants, 271 had severe COVID-19. Relative to non-essential workers, healthcare workers (RR 7.43, 95% CI 5.52 to 10.00), social and education workers (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.82) and other essential workers (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.45) had a higher risk of severe COVID-19. Using more detailed groupings, medical support staff (RR 8.70, 95% CI 4.87 to 15.55), social care (RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.47 to 4.14) and transport workers (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.00) had the highest risk within the broader groups. Compared with white non-essential workers, non-white non-essential workers had a higher risk (RR 3.27, 95% CI 1.90 to 5.62) and non-white essential workers had the highest risk (RR 8.34, 95% CI 5.17 to 13.47). Using SOC 2000 major groups, associate professional and technical occupations, personal service occupations and plant and machine operatives had a higher risk, compared with managers and senior officials.

METHODS Forty-nine patients with lung cancer (10 primary and 39 metastatic) underwent computed tomography-guided percutaneous RF ablation between June 2005 and October 2013. A total of 112 tumors (101 metastatic and 11 primary non-small cell lung cancer) were treated with RF ablation. Tumor diameter ranged from 0.6 to 4 cm (median 1.5 cm). Effectiveness of treatment, complications, and survival were analyzed. RESULTS Primary success rate was 79.5% and local tumor progression occurred in 23 tumors. Among tumors showing progression, 10 were re-treated with RF ablation and secondary success rate was 87.5%. One-, two-, and three-year overall survival rates of 10 patients with primary lung cancer were 100%, 86%, and 43%, respectively. One-, two-, three-, four-, and five-year overall survival rates for 39 patients with metastatic lung tumors were 90%, 73%, 59%, 55%, and 38%, respectively. One-, two-, three-, and four-year overall survival rates for 16 patients with colorectal pulmonary metastases were 94%, 80%, 68%, and 23%, respectively. Complications occurred in 30 sessions (24.6%). Pneumothorax occurred in 19 sessions with seven requiring image-guided percutaneous chest tube drainage. Tumor status (solitary or multiple) and presence of extrapulmonary metastasis at initial RF ablation were significant prognostic factors in terms of recurrence-free survival.

Our objective was to model the cost-per-HIV infection averted by CVCT in six African countries guided by an HIV prevention cascade framework. The HIV prevention cascade as yet to be applied to evaluating CVCT effectiveness or cost-effectiveness. METHODS We defined a priority population for CVCT in Africa as heterosexual adults in stable couples. Based on our previous experience nationalizing CVCT in Rwanda and scaling-up CVCT in 73 clinics in Zambia, we estimated HIV prevention cascade domains of motivation for use, access and effectiveness of CVCT as model parameters. Costs-per-couple tested were also estimated based on our previous studies. We used these parameters as well as country-specific inputs to model the impact of CVCT over a five-year time horizon in a previously developed and tested deterministic compartmental model. We consider six countries across Africa with varied HIV epidemics (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Tanzania, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone). Outcomes of interest were the proportion of HIV infections averted by CVCT, nationwide CVCT implementation costs and costs-per-HIV infection averted by CVCT. We applied 3%/year discounting to costs and outcomes. Univariate and Monte Carlo multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS We estimated that CVCT could avert between 54% (Sierra Leone) and 62% (South Africa) of adult HIV infections. Average costs-per-HIV infection averted were lowest in Zimbabwe ($550) and highest in South Africa ($1272). Nationwide implementations would cost between 7% (Kenya) and 21% (Ivory Coast) of a country's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) budget over five years. In sensitivity analyses, model outputs were most sensitive to estimates of cost-per-couple tested; the proportion of adults in heterosexual couples and HIV prevention cascade domains of CVCT motivation and access. CONCLUSIONS Our model indicates that nationalized CVCT could prevent over half of adult HIV infections for 7% to 21% of the modelled countries' five-year PEPFAR budgets. While other studies have indicated that CVCT motivation is high given locally relevant promotional and educational efforts, without required indicators, targets and dedicated budgets, access remains low.","Wall, Kristin M; Inambao, Mubiana; Kilembe, William; Karita, Etienne; Chomba, Elwyn; Vwalika, Bellington; Mulenga, Joseph; Parker, Rachel; Sharkey, Tyronza; Tichacek, Amanda; Hunter, Eric; Yohnka, Robert; Streeb, Gordon; Corso, Phaedra S; Allen, Susan",Journal of the International AIDS Society,669,1

Many approaches have hitherto been successfully established to prepare SACs, including impregnation, pyrolysis-involved processes, atom trapping, and coprecipitation. However, under typical reaction conditions, single atoms on catalysts tend to migrate or agglomerate, forming nanoclusters or nanoparticles, which lowers their surface free energy. Efforts are required to develop strategies for improving the thermal stability of SACs while achieving excellent catalytic performance. In this Progress Report, recent advances in the development of thermally durable single-atom heterogeneous catalysts are discussed. Several important preparation approaches for thermally stable SACs are described in this article. Fundamental understanding of the coordination structures of thermally stable single atom prepared by these methods is discussed. Furthermore, the catalytic performances of these thermally stable SACs are reviewed, including their activity and stability. Finally, a perspective of this important and rapidly evolving research field is provided.","Xiong, Haifeng; Datye, Abhaya K; Wang, Yong",Advanced materials,669,31

Its effect could be related to interferon lambda 4 (IFNL4), a protein which seems to confer some paradoxical disadvantages in hepatitis C virus (HCV) immune response. OBJECTIVES To assess the role of IFNL4 rs368234815 polymorphism on the response to antiviral treatment after liver transplantation (LT). STUDY DESIGN IFNL4 and IL28B polymorphisms were genotyped in 86 HCV-infected LT recipients and in their donors; all patients had undergone antiviral treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin after LT. RESULTS IFNL4 polymorphism strongly correlated with IL28B ones (p < 0.001). The favorable IFNL4 genotype (TT/TT) was significantly more frequent among donors than recipients (60% donors vs. 22% recipients, p <0.001). Recipient TT/TT genotype was associated with a higher sustained virological response rate after LT (p = 0.024). Nevertheless, the highest sustained virological response frequency was found when both donors and recipients had favorable genotypes (73% vs. 25%, p = 0.002), suggesting a role for donor genotype. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that IFNL4 rs368234815 polymorphism is an important predictor of response to antiviral treatment in the LT setting. These findings warrant further studies on IFNL4 role in immune response against HCV.","Fernández-Carrillo, Carlos; Coto-Llerena, Mairene; González, Patricia; Crespo, Gonzalo; Mensa, Laura; Caro-Pérez, Noelia; Gambato, Martina; Navasa, Miquel; Forns, Xavier; Pérez-del-Pulgar, Sofía",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,669,19

CNS infections in HIV-infected patients are often challenging to diagnose by traditional microbiological testing, impacting treatment and outcome. RECENT FINDINGS Recent advances in diagnostic techniques, including metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), are changing the landscape of microbiological testing, mainly in resource-rich settings. Pathogen discovery techniques offer a hypothesis-free approach to diagnostic testing, yielding comprehensive analysis of microbial genetic material. Given the extent of genetic material produced, deep sequencing tools not only hold promise in the diagnosis of CNS infections but also in defining key pathogenic steps which have previously been unanswered. Significant challenges remain to implementing pathogen discovery techniques in routine clinical practice including cost, expertise and infrastructure needed including laboratory and bioinformatics support, and sample contamination risk. The use in resource-limited regions where the burden of CNS complications due to HIV/AIDS is highest remains poorly defined. Though, major opportunities utilizing pathogen discovery techniques exist to enhance surveillance and diagnosis and improve our understanding of mechanisms of neuroinvasion in CNS conditions associated with HIV.","Thakur, Kiran T",Current HIV/AIDS reports,669,31

Yet, due to the apprehension of pain induced by nasopharyngeal probing, poor adhesion to those screening campaigns can be observed. To enhance voluntary participation and to avoid unnecessary exposition to SARS-CoV-2, self-swabbing could be proposed. To date, no data have been published concerning pain induced by conventional- or self-swabbing. Thus, the primary objective of the present study was to evaluate pain induced with the conventional swabbing method and compare it to self-swabbing. Secondary objectives focused on swabbing-induced discomfort and acceptability of the two methods. METHODS The study was conducted in Clermont-Ferrand medical school (France). Overall, 190 students were randomised into 2 groups and experienced either self- or conventional-swabbing. Each subject had to rate pain, discomfort and acceptability of such swabbing on a 0-10 numeric rating scale. RESULTS No significant difference was found between the two methods. Mean pain level was 2.5±1.9, 28% rating pain as ≥4/10. Discomfort was 4.8±2.2, 66% indicating significant (≥4/10) discomfort. Higher pain and discomfort were associated with female sex. Acceptability was ≥8/10 for 89.0% of the subjects and all would have accepted to undergo a new test with the same technique if necessary. CONCLUSION Both conventional and self-swabbing induce low levels of pain for most young healthy volunteers whereas discomfort is very frequent. Nonetheless, both methods are indifferently well-accepted in medical students. Future studies among symptomatic subjects are awaited.","Moisset, X; Gautier, N; Godet, T; Parabère, S; Pereira, B; Meunier, E; Gerbaud, L; Lesens, O; Henquell, C; Beytout, J; Clavelou, P",European journal of pain,669,1

This study aimed to compare the characteristics and treatment outcomes in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion relative to the existence or nonexistence of underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-two patients with acute basilar artery occlusion underwent multimodal endovascular therapy. All patients underwent stent-retriever thrombectomy as a first-line endovascular therapy. Patients with underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis underwent additional intracranial angioplasty and stent placement. The clinical and imaging characteristics and treatment outcomes were retrospectively analyzed and compared between patients with and without intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis. RESULTS Underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis was identified at the occlusion site in 15 patients (24.1%). Occlusion in the proximal segment of the basilar artery was more common in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (60% versus 6.4%, P < .001), whereas occlusion in the distal segment was more common in those without it (91.5% versus 26.7%, P < .001). Bilateral thalamic infarction on a pretreatment DWI was less common in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (0% versus 27.7%, P = .027) compared with those without it. There were no significant differences in the rates of successful revascularization, favorable outcome, symptomatic hemorrhage, and mortality between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis was not uncommon in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion. The occlusion segment of the basilar artery and the presence or absence of bilateral thalamic infarction on a pretreatment DWI might be helpful for predicting underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion. Patients with and without underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis who underwent endovascular therapy had similar outcomes.","Lee, Y Y; Yoon, W; Kim, S K; Baek, B H; Kim, G S; Kim, J T; Park, M S",AJNR.

This analysis explored whether availability of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants post-dabigatran approval was associated with changing treatment patterns in China. Methods Global Registry on Long-Term Oral Antithrombotic Treatment in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (GLORIA-AF) collected data on antithrombotic therapy choices for patients with newly diagnosed nonvalvular AF at risk for stroke. In China, enrollment in phase 1 (before dabigatran approval) and phase 2 (after dabigatran approval) occurred from 2011 to 2013 and 2013 to 2014, respectively. Analyses were restricted to sites within China that contributed patients to both phases. The weighted average of the site-specific results was estimated for standardization. Sensitivity analyses used multiple regression. Results Thirteen sites participated in both phase 1 (419 patients) and phase 2 (276 patients), 76.1% and 16.0% were known to be at high risk for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥2) and bleeding (HAS-BLED ≥3); 55.5% were male. In phase 1, 16.7%, 61.6%, and 21.7% of patients were prescribed oral anticoagulants (OACs), antiplatelet agents, and no treatment, respectively. Respective proportions were 26.4%, 40.6%, and 33.0% in phase 2. The absolute increase in the site-standardized proportion of patients prescribed OACs after dabigatran availability was 9.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7%-16.0%). There was a standardized 17.3% (95% CI: -24.3% to -10.4%) absolute decrease in antiplatelet agent use. Conclusions There was an increase in OAC and decrease in antiplatelet agent prescription since dabigatran availability in China.

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-derived phase angle may reflect frailty and functional decline in cancer patients. High-dose vitamin D supplementation may improve phase angle values and physical function. METHODS We conducted an exploratory analysis from a phase II randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of high-dose vitamin D supplementation in prostate cancer patients (age ≥ 60 yrs). Fifty-nine patients were randomized to high-dose vitamin D (600 IU/day plus 50,000 IU/week) or low-dose: RDA for vitamin D (600 IU/day plus placebo weekly) for 24 weeks. Phase angle was measured by BIA. Physical function measures included handgrip strength, 6-minute walk test, Short Performance Physical Battery and leg extension. All testing was completed at baseline, week 12 and week 24. RESULTS Phase angle values were wider over the entire study in the high-dose vitamin D arm indicating healthier muscle cells. The low-dose vitamin D arm had phase angle values consistent with frailty cutoffs in older men (<5.7°). CONCLUSION Patients in the high-dose vitamin D arm experienced wider phase angle values over the course of the study which may indicate less frailty.

While an emphasis has been placed on the importance of PPE, there is debate about the most effective training methods. Circumstances may not allow for a traditional in-person demonstration; an accessible video training may provide a useful alternative. HYPOTHESIS Video training of Emergency Medicine (EM) residents in the donning and doffing of Level C PPE is more effective than in-person training. NULL HYPOTHESIS Video training of EM residents in the donning and doffing of Level C PPE is equally effective compared with in-person training. METHODS A randomized, controlled pilot trial was performed with 20 EM residents as part of their annual Emergency Preparedness training. Residents were divided into four groups, with Group 1 and Group 2 viewing a demonstration video developed by the Emergency Preparedness Team (EPT) and Group 3 and Group 4 receiving the standard in-person demonstration training by an EPT member. The groups then separately performed a donning and doffing simulation while blinded evaluators assessed critical tasks utilizing a prepared evaluation tool. At the drill's conclusion, all participants also completed a self-evaluation survey about their subjective interpretations of their respective trainings. RESULTS Both video and in-person training modalities showed significant overall improvement in participants' confidence in doffing and donning PPE equipment (P <.05). However, no statistically significant difference was found in the number of failed critical tasks in donning or doffing between the training modalities (P >.05). Based on these results, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. However, these results were limited by the small sample size and the study was not sufficiently powered to show a difference between training modalities. CONCLUSION In this pilot study, video and in-person training were equally effective in training for donning and doffing Level C PPE, with similar error rates in both modalities. Further research into this subject with an appropriately powered study is warranted to determine whether this equivalence persists using a larger sample size.","Salway, Richard J; Williams, Trenika; Londono, Camilo; Roblin, Patricia; Koenig, Kristi; Arquilla, Bonnie",Prehospital and disaster medicine,669,1

Despite these challenges, the creation of composite (or mosaic) genes by combination of genetic segments from unrelated gene families was established as an important adaptive phenomena in eukaryotic genomes. In contrast, almost no general studies have been conducted to quantify composite genes in viruses. Although viral genome mosaicism has been well-described, the extent of gene mosaicism and its rules of emergence remain largely unexplored. Applying methods from graph theory to inclusive similarity networks, and using data from more than 3,000 complete viral genomes, we provide the first demonstration that composite genes in viruses are 1) functionally biased, 2) involved in key aspects of the arm race between cells and viruses, and 3) can be classified into two distinct types of composite genes in all viral classes. Beyond the quantification of the widespread recombination of genes among different viruses of the same class, we also report a striking sharing of genetic information between viruses of different classes and with different nucleic acid types. This latter discovery provides novel evidence for the existence of a large and complex mobilome network, which appears partly bound by the sharing of genetic information and by the formation of composite genes between mobile entities with different genetic material. Considering that there are around 10E31 viruses on the planet, gene remodeling appears as a hugely significant way of generating and moving novel sequences between different kinds of organisms on Earth.","Jachiet, Pierre-Alain; Colson, Philippe; Lopez, Philippe; Bapteste, Eric",Genome biology and evolution,669,20

Outcomes stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) are also unknown. A single center retrospective chart review was performed for patients who underwent treatment for CLI from 2006 to 2013. Baseline demographics, procedural data and outcomes were analyzed. HF diagnosis was based on appropriate signs and symptoms as well as results of non-invasive testing. Among 381 CLI patients, 120 (31%) had a history of HF and 261 (69%) had no history of heart failure (no-HF). Within the HF group, 74 (62%) had HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and 46 (38%) had HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The average EF for those with no-HF, HFpEF and HFrEF were 59±13% vs 56±9% vs 30±9%, respectively. The likelihood of having concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) was lowest in the no-HF group (43%), higher in the HFpEF group (70%) and highest in the HFrEF group (83%) ( p=0.001). Five-year survival was on average twofold higher in the no-HF group (43%) compared to both the HFpEF (19%, p=0.001) and HFrEF groups (24%, p=0.001). Long-term survival rates did not differ between the two HF groups ( p=0.50). There was no difference in 5-year freedom from major amputation or freedom from major adverse limb events between the no-HF, HFpEF and HFrEF groups, respectively.

The Ottawa Decision Support Framework (ODSF) has been used for 20 years to assess and address people's decisional needs. The evidence regarding ODSF decisional needs has not been synthesized. Objectives. To synthesize evidence from ODSF-based decisional needs studies, identify new decisional needs, and validate current ODSF decisional needs. Methods. A mixed-studies systematic review. Nine electronic databases were searched. Inclusion criteria: studies of people's decisional needs when making health or social decisions for themselves, a child, or a mentally incapable person, as reported by themselves, families, or practitioners. Two independent authors screened eligibility, extracted data, and quality appraised studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data were analyzed using narrative synthesis. Results. Of 4532 citations, 45 studies from 7 countries were eligible. People's needs for 101 unique decisions (85 health, 16 social) were reported by 2857 patient decision makers (n = 36 studies), 92 parent decision makers (n = 6), 81 family members (n = 5), and 523 practitioners (n = 21). Current ODSF decisional needs were reported in 2 to 40 studies. For 6 decisional needs, there were 11 new (manifestations): 1) information (overload, inadequacy regarding others' experiences with options), 2) difficult decisional roles (practitioner, family involvement, or deliberations), 3) unrealistic expectations (difficulty believing outcome probabilities apply to them), 4) personal needs (religion/spirituality), 5) difficult decision timing (unpredictable), and 6) unreceptive decisional stage (difficulty accepting condition/need for treatment, powerful emotions limiting information processing, lacking motivation to consider delayed/unpredictable decisions). Limitations. Possible publication bias (only peer-reviewed journals included). Possible missed needs (non-ODSF studies, patient decision aid development studies, 3 ODSF needs added in 2006). Conclusion. We validated current decisional needs, identified 11 new manifestations of 6 decisional needs, and recommended ODSF revisions.","Hoefel, Lauren; O'Connor, Annette M; Lewis, Krystina B; Boland, Laura; Sikora, Lindsey; Hu, Jiale; Stacey, Dawn",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,669,33

We investigated the usefulness of systemic immunity markers associated with lymphocytes as predictive markers for PB therapy in patients with HER2-negative ABC. We retrospectively reviewed data from 114 patients with HER2-negative ABC who underwent PB therapy from November 2011 to December 2019. We calculated the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) as representative systemic immunity markers. The time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS) of the patients with high ALC, low NLR, and high LMR were significantly longer compared with those of the patients with low ALC, high NLR, and low LMR. A multivariable analysis revealed that high ALC, low NLR, and low PLR were independent predictors for TTF and high ALC, low NLR, and high LMR were independent predictors for OS. Systemic immunity markers were significantly associated with longer TTF and OS in patients who underwent PB therapy and may represent predictive markers for PB therapy in patients with HER2-negative ABC.","Nakamoto, Shogo; Ikeda, Masahiko; Kubo, Shinichiro; Yamamoto, Mari; Yamashita, Tetsumasa; Notsu, Akifumi",Scientific reports,669,1

The status of the infected cases can be determined basing on the treatment process along with several other factors. This research aims to build a classifier prediction model to predict the status of recovered and death coronavirus CovID-19 patients in South Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS Artificial neural network principle is used to classify the collected data between February 20, 2020 and March 9, 2020. The proposed classifier used different seven variables, namely, country, infection reason, sex, group, confirmation date, birth year, and region. The most effective variables on recovered and fatal cases are analyzed based on the neural network model. RESULTS The results found that the proposed predictive classifier efficiently predicted recovered and death cases. Besides, it is found that discovering the infection reason would increase the probability to recover the patient. This indicates that the virus might be controllable based on infection reasons. In addition, the earlier discovery of the disease affords better control and a higher probability of being recovered. CONCLUSIONS Our recommendation is to use this model to predict the status of the patients globally.","Al-Najjar, H; Al-Rousan, N",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,669,1

This study aims to investigate the accuracy of parental perception of child's weight and related factors as well as how underestimation is associated with the prevalence of childhood obesity. METHODS Data from 793 parents and respective children (6-10 years) were collected during the spring of 2013 and 2014. Height and weight were measured and used to calculate body mass index and obesity was classified using the International Obesity Task Force. Parents' perception of child's weight and socio-demographic characteristics were accessed by a questionnaire. Statistical tests were used, controlling for biological and social covariates. RESULTS About 33% of parents misperceived their child's weight, of which 93% underestimated it. Different factors were found associated with greater parental underestimation according to children's weight status (ie, younger age) and sex (ie, higher mother's BMI, lower parental education, and household income for girls; living in an urban place for boys). Underestimation among girls, compared to boys, was more associated with socio-economic features of the family. For both sexes, children with excess weight were more likely to be underestimated by their parents. Parents who underestimated their child's weight were 10 to 20 times more likely to have an obese child. CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest a social desirability bias in parental reports of child weight status. While some parents recognize their child's weight, others may feel embarrassed to discuss the fact that their child is overweight/obese and may feel reluctant in seeking the advice of a health care professional.","Rodrigues, Daniela; Machado-Rodrigues, Aristides M; Padez, Cristina",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,669,7

Waterfowl and shorebirds are believed to be the reservoir for all influenza A viruses, but this has recently been challenged by the identification of novel influenza A viruses in bats1,2. The major bat influenza A virus envelope glycoprotein, haemagglutinin, does not bind the canonical influenza A virus receptor, sialic acid or any other glycan1,3,4, despite its high sequence and structural homology with conventional haemagglutinins. This functionally uncharacterized plasticity of the bat influenza A virus haemagglutinin means the tropism and zoonotic potential of these viruses has not been fully determined. Here we show, using transcriptomic profiling of susceptible versus non-susceptible cells in combination with genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening, that the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) human leukocyte antigen DR isotype (HLA-DR) is an essential entry determinant for bat influenza A viruses. Genetic ablation of the HLA-DR α-chain rendered cells resistant to infection by bat influenza A virus, whereas ectopic expression of the HLA-DR complex in non-susceptible cells conferred susceptibility. Expression of MHC-II from different bat species, pigs, mice or chickens also conferred susceptibility to infection. Notably, the infection of mice with bat influenza A virus resulted in robust virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, whereas mice deficient for MHC-II were resistant. Collectively, our data identify MHC-II as a crucial entry mediator for bat influenza A viruses in multiple species, which permits a broad vertebrate tropism.","Karakus, Umut; Thamamongood, Thiprampai; Ciminski, Kevin; Ran, Wei; Günther, Sira C; Pohl, Marie O; Eletto, Davide; Jeney, Csaba; Hoffmann, Donata; Reiche, Sven; Schinköthe, Jan; Ulrich, Reiner; Wiener, Julius; Hayes, Michael G B; Chang, Max W; Hunziker, Annika; Yángüez, Emilio; Aydillo, Teresa; Krammer, Florian; Oderbolz, Josua; Meier, Matthias; Oxenius, Annette; Halenius, Anne; Zimmer, Gert; Benner, Christopher; Hale, Benjamin G; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Beer, Martin; Schwemmle, Martin; Stertz, Silke",Nature,669,31

The systemic inflammatory response of SARS-CoV-2 along with the hypercoagulable state that the infection elicits can lead to acute thrombotic complications including ischemic stroke. We present 3 cases of patients with COVID-19 disease who presented with varying degrees of vascular thrombosis. Cases Cases 1 and 2 presented as cerebral ischemic strokes without respiratory failure. Given their exposure risks, they were both tested for COVID-19 disease. Case 2 ultimately developed respiratory failure and pulmonary embolism. Cases 2 and 3 were found to have simultaneous arterial and venous thromboembolism (ischemic stroke and pulmonary embolism) as well as positive antiphospholipid antibodies. Conclusion Our case series highlight the presence of hypercoagulability as an important mechanism in patients with COVID-19 disease with and without respiratory failure. Despite arterial and venous thromboembolic events, antiphospholipid and hypercoagulable panels in the acute phase can be difficult to interpret in the context of acute phase response and utilization of thrombolytics. SARS-CoV-2 testing in patients presenting with stroke symptoms may be useful in communities with a high case burden or patients with a history of exposure.","Mullaguri, Naresh; Hepburn, Madihah; Gebel, James Matthew; Itrat, Ahmed; George, Pravin; Newey, Christopher R",The Neurohospitalist,669,29

These compounds also accumulate in hypoxic cells, where they can act as cytotoxins or imaging agents. However, whether these effects apply to cancer stem cells has not been sufficiently explored. Here we show that the 2-nitroimidazole doranidazole potentiates radiation-induced DNA damage in hypoxic glioma stem cells (GSCs) and confers a significant survival benefit in mice harboring GSC-derived tumors in radiotherapy settings. Furthermore, doranidazole and misonidazole, but not metronidazole, manifested radiation-independent cytotoxicity for hypoxic GSCs that was mediated by ferroptosis induced partially through blockade of mitochondrial complexes I and II and resultant metabolic alterations in oxidative stress responses. Doranidazole also limited the growth of GSC-derived subcutaneous tumors and that of tumors in orthotopic brain slices. Our results thus reveal the theranostic potential of 2-nitroimidazoles as ferroptosis inducers that enable targeting GSCs in their hypoxic niche.","Koike, Naoyoshi; Kota, Ryuichi; Naito, Yoshiko; Hayakawa, Noriyo; Matsuura, Tomomi; Hishiki, Takako; Onishi, Nobuyuki; Fukada, Junichi; Suematsu, Makoto; Shigematsu, Naoyuki; Saya, Hideyuki; Sampetrean, Oltea",Communications biology,669,1

Given that the process of producing new drugs is so long, the strategy of repurposing existing drugs is one of the promising options for the urgent treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. Although FDA has approved Remdesivir for the use in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients suffering from COVID-19, no fully effective and reliable drug has been yet identified worldwide to treat COVID-19 specifically. Thus, scientists are still trying to find antivirals specific to COVID-19. This work reviews the chemical structure, metabolic pathway, mechanism of action of existing drugs with potential therapeutic applications for COVID-19.

It is well known that controls can have counterintuitive effects, such as the honeymoon effect, in which partially effective controls cause not only a greater initial reduction in infection than expected for an infection near its endemic equilibrium, but also large outbreaks during control as a result of accumulation of susceptibles. Unfortunately, many control measures cannot be maintained indefinitely, and the results of cessation are not well understood. Here, we examine the results of stopped or failed non-immunizing control measures in endemic settings. By using a mathematical model to compare the cumulative number of cases expected with and without the control measures, we show that deployment of control can lead to a larger total number of infections, counting from the time that control started, than without any control – the divorce effect. This result is directly related to the population-level loss of immunity resulting from non-immunizing controls and is seen in model results from a number of settings when non-immunizing controls are used against an infection that confers immunity. Finally, we also examine three control plans for minimizing the magnitude of the divorce effect in seasonal infections and show that they are incapable of eliminating the divorce effect. While we do not suggest stopping control programs that rely on non-immunizing controls, our results strongly argue that the accumulation of susceptibility should be considered before deploying such controls against endemic infections when indefinite use of the control is unlikely. We highlight that our results are particularly germane to endemic mosquito-borne infections, such as dengue virus, both for routine management involving vector control and for field trials of novel control approaches. Author Summary Many common endemic infections lack effective, inexpensive vaccinations, and control relies instead on transmission reduction, e.g. mosquito population reduction for dengue. Often, these controls are used with the immediate goal of decreasing the current incidence with little importance placed on what will happen at later points in time, and much less what will happen once the control is stopped. Here, by looking at the cumulative incidence since the beginning of the control period, instead of the instantaneous incidence, we show that when controls are stopped, or fail, the resulting outbreaks can be large enough to completely eliminate any benefit of the control. We call this result the divorce effect. Further, we show that this result is not limited to specific transmission pathways or epidemiological parameters, but is instead tied directly to the reduction of herd immunity inherent in non-immunizing controls. Lastly, by evaluating programs to minimize the magnitude of the divorce effect, we show that without maintaining herd immunity, or successfully continuing control for decades, it is impossible to keep the costs of post-control outbreaks from outweighing the benefits of the control program.","Hollingsworth, Brandon; Okamoto, Kenichi W; Lloyd, Alun L",bioRxiv,669,24

Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were developed and executed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library, and grey literature was searched via international clinical trial registries for relevant studies published in English in the last 20 years. References of relevant systematic reviews and included studies were also scanned. Title/abstract and full-text screening were carried out by pairs of reviewers independently and data charting conducted by a single reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Results were presented narratively. Results: A total of 13 studies with 10,351 participants were included in the review and all studies were randomized control trials conducted between 2006 and 2019. The most common interventions were the trivalent influenza vaccine (n=10), followed by quadrivalent influenza vaccine (n=4). Nine studies included infants/toddlers 6-36 months old and one of these studies also included children and adolescents. In these nine studies, no clinical effectiveness outcomes were reported and no difference was found in local and systemic reactogenicity between dosing strategies. Of the four adult studies ([≥] 18 years), the two studies that reported on effectiveness outcomes found similar results between the half-dose and full-dose vaccination groups and all four studies reported no differences in safety outcomes between groups. Conclusion: The current evidence for the administration of intramuscular influenza vaccines suggests there is no significant difference in safety and clinical effectiveness with the use of low-dose compared to full-dose vaccines, which is promising given the predicted resource constraints in the upcoming influenza season due to the 2019 novel coronavirus. Due to the low number of studies in adults and the lack of studies assessing confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness, there remains a need for further evaluation.","Antony, J.; Rios, P.; Williams, C.; Ramkissoon, N.; Straus, S.

It has long been recognised that some patients have such significant clinical and/or risk needs that those needs cannot be adequately met within standard service delivery models, resulting in a pressing need to consider the best models for this group of people. This paper shares a protocol for a mixed methods study that aims to understand: the profile and history of service users described as having complex needs; the decision-making processes by clinicians that lead to complex needs categorisation; service users and carers experience of service use; and, associated economic impact. This protocol describes a comprehensive evaluation that aims to inform an evidence-based service delivery model for people with complex needs. Methods We will use a mixed methods design, combining quantitative and qualitative methods using in-depth descriptive and inferential analysis of patient records, written medical notes and in-depth interviews with service users, carers, and clinicians. The study will include five components: (1) a quantitative description and analysis of the demographic clinical characteristics of the patient group; (2) an economic evaluation of alternative patient pathways; (3) semi-structured interviews about service user and carer experiences; (4) using data from components 1-3 to co-produce vignettes jointly with relevant stakeholders involved in the care of service users with complex mental health needs; and, (5) semi-structured interviews about clinical decision-making by clinicians in relation to this patient group, using the vignettes as example case studies. Discussion The studys key outcomes will be to: examine the resource use and cost-impact associated with alternative care pathways to the NHS and other sectors of the economy (including social care); explore patient health and non-health outcomes associated with alternative care pathways; and, gain an understanding of a complex service user group and how treatment decisions are made to inform consistent and person-centred future service delivery.","Saini, P.; Martin, A.; McIntyre, J.; Balmer, A.; Burton, S.; Roks, H.; Sambrook, L.; Shetty, A.; Nathan, R.",,669,19

ARMMS-T2D is a multi-center consortium conducting a follow-up study of 4 merged RCTs in 256 patients with baseline Class 1-3 obesity and T2D, randomly assigned to metabolic surgery (MS;Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or gastric banding) or intensive Medical/Lifestyle Intervention (MLI). Three years after randomization, T2D remission rates were higher after MS than MLI (37.5%, 60/160 vs. 2.6%, 2/76, respectively, P<0.001). Adjusting for treatment allocation, baseline HbA1c, and T2D duration, the probability of remission with MS was 41.6% (95% CI, 29.6-58.3%) compared to 1% (95% CI, 0.2-4.0%) with MLI (P<0.001). MS patients experienced greater reductions than MLI in HbA1c (-1.9±2.0 vs. -0.1±2.0%, P<0.001) and fasting plasma glucose (-52 [-105, 5] vs. -12 [-48, 26] mg/dL, P<0.001). Compared to MLI, MS patients had greater reductions in BMI (-22.0±9.4 vs. -4.8±7.9 kg/m2, P<0.001) and waist circumference (-17.5 ±10.2 vs. -2.1±9.6 cm, P<0.001), greater increases in HDL-C (35.5± 27.6 vs. 9.1±24.1, P<0.001), greater reductions in triglycerides (-33[-52, -2] vs. -10 [-36, 14] P<0.001), and similar changes in LDL-C (9.5±41.5 vs. 4.2±31.6 mg/dL). MS and MLI rendered similar reductions in albumin/creatinine ratio (-2 [-13, 1] vs. 0 [-4, 4]) and eGFR (-3.1±16.7 vs. -4.6±19.5 mL/min/1.73 m2). Also, MS patients required fewer medications for diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia compared to MLI (P<0.001). In summary, this 3-year follow-up of the largest cohort of patients randomized to metabolic surgery vs. non-surgical treatment demonstrates that surgery is more effective than intensive medical/lifestyle therapy in achieving extended diabetes remission, BMI reduction, and improved metabolic disease biomarkers while reducing medication requirements.

Understanding correlates of protection post-vaccination can inform immunization and mitigation strategies. Methods: Monthly since January 2021, we tested plasma from 4791 patients receiving dialysis for antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 using a high-throughput assay. We qualitatively assessed the proportion without a detectable RBD response and among those with a response, semiquantitative median IgG index values. Using a nested case-control design, we matched each breakthrough case to five controls by age, sex, and vaccination-month to determine whether peak and pre-breakthrough RBD IgG index values were associated with risk for infection post-vaccination. Results: Among 2563 vaccinated patients, the proportion without a detectable RBD response increased from 6.6% [95% CI 5.5-8.1] in 14-30 days post-vaccination to 20.2% [95% CI 17.1-23.8], and median index values declined from 92.7 (95% CI 77.8-107.5) to 3.7 (95% CI 3.1-4.3) after 5 months. Persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection prior-to-vaccination had higher peak index values than persons without prior infection, but values equalized by 5 months (p=0.230). Breakthrough infections occurred in 56 patients, with samples collected a median of 21 days pre-breakthrough. Peak and pre-breakthrough RBD values <23 (equivalent to <506 WHO BAU/mL) were associated with higher odds for breakthrough infection (OR: 3.7 [95% CI 2.0-6.8] and 9.8 [95% CI 2.9-32.8], respectively). Conclusions: The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination wanes rapidly, and in persons receiving dialysis, the persisting antibody response is associated with risk for breakthrough infection.","Anand, S.; Montez-Rath, M.

The measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have brought various restrictions both in social life and in areas such as education, economy and health. Due to the pandemic and subsequent restrictions, students continuing to higher education are likely to experience some psychological problems such as anxiety and depression. Therefore, studies regarding the anxiety levels of students should be carried out. In line with this need, the aim of the study is to adapt the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) into Turkish in the context of higher education. The sample consisted of 513 undergraduate and graduate students. The data collection tools were the CAS and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The results of the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the factor structure of the original scale and yielded an excellent fit for all the indices. The original factor structure of the CAS was also confirmed, and the scores significantly correlated with gender, state-anxiety and health status of the participants. The scores obtained from the adapted scale were found highly reliable and valid. The increase in the spread of COVID-19, especially after the mutations of the virus have emerged, indicates that its psychological and behavioral consequences and effects might last longer. To this end, the study has valuable implications for higher education policy makers, university administrators and teaching staff.","Mor-Dirlik, Ezgi Akcaoǧlu Mustafa Öztürk Külekçi Erkan",Bartin &amp;Uuml;niversitesi Egitim Fakültesi Dergisi,669,1

We assessed whether the implementation of a home treatment algorithm, designed based upon on a pathophysiologic and pharmacologic rationale, during the initial, mild phase of COVID-19, could effectively reduce hospital admissions. Methods: This fully academic, matched-cohort study evaluated outcomes in 108 consecutive consenting patients with mild COVID-19 managed at home by their family doctors from January 2021 to May 2021, according to the proposed treatment algorithm and in 108 age-, sex-, and comorbidities-matched patients who were given other therapeutic schedules (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04854824). The primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospitalization. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. Results: One (0.9%) patient in the recommended cohort and 12 (11.1%) in the control cohort were admitted to hospital (P=0.0136). The proposed algorithm reduced, by 85%, the cumulative length of hospital stays (from 141 to 19 days) and related costs (from Euro 60.316 to Euro 9.058). Only 9.8 patients needed to be treated with the recommended algorithm to prevent one hospitalization event. The rate of resolution of major symptoms was numerically, but not significantly, higher in the recommended compared to the control cohort (97.2% versus 93.5%, respectively; P=0.322). Other symptoms lingered in a lower proportion of patients in the recommended than in the control cohort (20.4% versus 63.9%, respectively; P<0.001), and for a shorter period. Conclusion: The adoption of the proposed outpatient treatment algorithm during the early, mild phase of COVID-19 reduced the incidence of subsequent hospitalization and related costs.","Consolaro, E.; Suter, F.; Rubis, N.; Pedroni, S.; Moroni, C.; Pasto, E.; Paganini, M.

Objectives: The aim of the systematic review was to evaluate qualitative literature to investigate how implementing time-based-targets for emergency department length-of-stay has influenced the quality of care of patients. Methods: Systematic review of qualitative studies that described knowledge, attitudes to or experiences regarding a time-based-target for emergency department length-of-stay. Searches were conducted in Cochrane library, Medline, Embase, CInAHL, Emerald, ABI/Inform, and Informit. Individual studies were evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. Individual study findings underwent thematic analysis. Confidence in findings was assessed using the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research approach. Results: The review included thirteen studies from four countries, incorporating 617 interviews. Themes identified were: quality of care, access block and overcrowding, patient experience, staff morale and workload, intrahospital and interdepartmental relationships, clinical education and training, gaming, and enablers and barriers to achieving targets. The confidence in findings is moderate or high for most themes. More patient and junior doctor perspectives are needed. Conclusions: Emergency time-based-targets have impacted on the quality of emergency patient care.

Customary agricultural systems built by Kānaka ‘Ōiwi (Indigenous Hawaiian) are now rested within a landscape filled with many different crops tended by farmers from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Value systems dictating farming practices and crop selling decisions differ. In Hawai'i, values of food security or food sovereignty are of particular importance, especially as growing movements seek to increase local production and decrease the state's reliance on imported food in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we systematically compare two different groups of farmers in Hawai'i and their values related to production and distribution. We then analyze the experiences of these two groups of farmers during the COVID-19 pandemic and their responses to them. The study is based on interviews with 22 Indigenous Kānaka ‘Ōiwi (IF) and Non-Indigenous local farmers (LF) from the island of O‘ahu. Ninety percent of IF say values associated with both food security and sovereignty drive their production and distribution decisions, while 75% of LF describe food security as the sole driver. Sixty percent of IF follow a non-profit economic model and emphasize cultural and educational values in their production decisions. LF follow profit-driven models and emphasize the influence the market has in their decisions. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, IF sold or donated the bulk of their crops to the local community through farm pickups, while restaurants were the primary buyers of LF crops. During the pandemic, the local community continues to be the primary recipient for IF, and due to the closure of many restaurants, LF have pivoted their sales to the community as well. Farmer interviews are augmented by three interviews with Hawai'i food system experts and relevant literature to suggest multiple pathways state agencies and local organizations could implement to support farmers from different backgrounds through COVID-19 and into the future. © Copyright © 2021 Hutchins and Feldman.","Hutchins, L.; Feldman, M.",Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,669,1

Well-established principles of response include effective and scalable treatment for individuals affected by PTSD. In England, such responses have combined proactive outreach, screening, and evidence-based interventions (a 'screen-and-treat' approach), but little is known about the cost-effectiveness of this approach. Methods A decision modelling analysis was undertaken to estimate the costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from a screen-and-treat approach compared to treatment-as-usual. Model input variables were drawn from relevant empirical studies in the context of terrorism and the unit costs of health and social care in England. The model was run over a five-year time horizon for a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 exposed adults from the perspective of the National Health Service and Personal Social Services in England. Results The incremental cost per QALY gained was GBP8,297. This would be considered cost-effective 95% of the time at a willingness-to-pay threshold of GBP20,000 per QALY gained, the threshold associated with NICE. Sensitivity analysis confirmed this result was robust. Conclusions A screen-and-treat approach for identifying and treating PTSD in adults following major incidents appears cost-effective in England compared to treatment-as-usual through conventional primary care routes. This finding was in the context of terrorism but can be translatable into other major-incident related scenarios including the current COVID-19 pandemic in lieu of data on the impact of this pandemic.","Davies, M.; Hogan, N.; Knapp, M.; McDaid, D.; Brewin, C.",,669,13

The goal of the problem is to locate the facilities such that the people can be served and at the same time the total social distancing is maximized. We formally call this problem as the Social Distancing-Based Facility Location Problem. We mathematically quantify social distancing for a given allocation of facilities and proposed an optimization model.

Consequently, the need to interpret longitudinal positive SARS-CoV-2 (SCV-2) tests is crucial in guiding clinical decisions regarding infection control precautions and treatment. Although quantitative tests are not routinely used diagnostically, standard diagnostic RT-PCR tests yield Ct values that are inversely correlated with RNA quantity. In this study, we performed a retrospective review of 72,217 SCV-2 PCR positive tests and identified 264 patients with longitudinal positivity prior to vaccination and VOC circulation. Patients with longitudinal positivity fell into two categories: short-term (207, 78%) or prolonged (57, 22%) positivity, defined as <= 28 (range 1-28, median 16) days and >28 (range 29- 152, median 41) days, respectively. In general, Ct values declined over time in both groups; however, 11 short-term positive patients had greater amounts of RNA detected at their terminal test compared to the first positive, and 5 patients had RNA detected at Ct < 35 at least 40 days after initial infection. Oscillating positive and negative results occurred in both groups, although oscillation was seen three times more frequently in prolonged-positive patients. Patients with prolonged positivity had diverse clinical characteristics but were often critically ill and were discharged to high-level care or deceased (22%). Overall, this study demonstrates that caution must be emphasized when interpreting Ct values as a proxy for infectivity, predictor of severity, or a guide for patient care decisions in the absence of additional clinical context.","Hawken, S.

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus, and is the causal agent for coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Due to the urgency of the situation, virtual screening as a computational modeling method offers a fast and effective modality of identifying drugs that may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. There has been an overwhelming abundance of molecular docking against SARS-CoV-2 in the last year. Due to the massive volume of computational studies, this systematic review has been created to evaluate and summarize the findings of existing studies. Herein, we report on computational articles of drugs which target, (1) viral protease, (2) Spike protein-ACE 2 interaction, (3) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and (4) other proteins and nonstructural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Based on the studies presented, there are 55 identified natural or drug compounds with potential anti-viral activity. The next step is to show anti-viral activity in vitro and translation to determine effectiveness into human clinical trials.","Hassanzadeganroudsari, Majid Ahmadi Amir Hossein Rashidi Niloufar Hossain Md Kamal Habib Amanda Apostolopoulos Vasso",Biologics,669,20

This disease is referred to as zoonosis. Covid-19 discourse is generally about zoonotic transmission from animals to humans. Not much attention has been given to the potential transmission from humans to animals. In several countries, cases indicating the exposures of animals with the Coronavirus have been found. Thus, a discussion on the vulnerability of exposure to animals with the Coronavirus is significant to scientifically discussed. Unfortunately, concerns about this problem are still voiced by the mass media. Limited studies have been found, especially in Legal Science. In Indonesia, the Covid-19 incidence has hit more than 200 thousand people, one of the highest in Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, animal protection policy is not part of the national program of Covid-19 Control. Indonesia has several laws and regulations concerning animal welfare and zoonosis control. This article presents our study's findings investigating how the animal welfare law is applicable to protect the animals from Covid-19. Using the method of normative legal analysis, we found several weaknesses in the legal norms. We also observed how the ethics of anthropocentrism and ecocentrism compete in animal welfare laws. © 2021 HALREV. All rights reserved.","Safitri, M. A.; Firman, F.",Hasanuddin Law Review,669,1

Our results show that the relationship dynamics of stock market and cryptocurrency returns both in the short and long run are changing during the COVID-19 crisis period, which justifies our study using the nonlinear and asymmetric model. As far as a sustainable safe haven is concerned, Dash and Ripple are found to be a safe haven for all the five markets before the pandemic. However, all five cryptocurrencies are found to be a safe haven for three emerging markets, such as Brazil, China, and Russia, during the financial crisis. In a comparative framework, gold is found to be a suitable safe haven only for Brazil and Russia.

While stress hyperglycemia (StH) has been established as a risk factor for death in some critically ill cohorts, it is not a well-established risk factor for MV in COVID-19. The COVIDEastDM consortium pooled data from 5 academic hospitals on the East Coast of the US to study the relationship between hyperglycemia and COVID-19 outcomes. Data were obtained retrospectively from electronic records of adults with COVID-19 and either DM or StH (defined in this cohort as day-1 admission blood glucose >180 mg/dl and A1c <6.5%). This analysis included 3,435 individuals, of which 1,001 (29.1%) required MV and 748 (21.8%) died. The mean age was 67 ± 15 yrs., BMI 30.4 ± 7.7 kg/m2, A1c 7.98 ± 2.21 % and glucose 184 ± 104 mg/dl. Additionally, 57% were male, 4 % Asian,19% Black, 52% White, and 28% Hispanic. In a univariate analysis, risk factors for MV included younger age (OR 0.98 [95% CI 0.97, 0.99] per year older), male sex (OR 1.4 [1.2, 1.7]), BMI (OR 1.013 [1.003, 1.023] per kg/m2), Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.16 [1.07, 1.28]) and the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis (n=38) at admission (OR 3.9 [2.0, 7.5]). Patients with StH were more likely to require MV (OR 1.93, [1.10, 3.39]). In a multivariate analysis, this relationship was continuous, with both lower A1c and higher glucose increasing risk of MV (p< 0.01 for higher glucose, p<0.001 for lower A1c). Patients who required MV were more likely to die than those who did not require MV (OR 5.1, [4.3, 6.1]) and StH predicted mortality in the multivariate analysis. Thus, in patients hospitalized with COVID19 infection, StH is a strong predictor of both MV and death in COVID-19 infected adults. While it is unclear if StH is a cause or effect of severe COVID-19, its presence early in the hospital course identifies higher risk patients and could potentially impact management.","McDonnell, Marie E.; Simonson, Donald C.; Cromwell, Grace Gopalakrishnan Geetha Greenfield Margaret Johnson Matthew Katta Sai R.; Lebastchi, Jasmin Mitri Joanna Palermo Nadine E.; Radhakrishnan, Ramya Westcott Gregory P.; Weinstock, Ruth S.; Garg, Rajesh",Diabetes,669,20

Methods: We analyzed the number of ED visits occurred in our breast cancer population between July 1 2019 and August 31 2020 including demographics, stage distribution, treatment type within the month of ED visit, reason, time of the day, day of the week the visit occurred. Results: A total of 101 patients had 162 visits. 38 (38%) had more than 1 ED visit. Majority (36%) had stage 4 disease at the time of ED visit. The top 5 reasons for ED visits were fall and injury (N=30), GI (N=24), cardiac (N=17), respiratory symptoms (N=14) and cancer related pain (N=11). The median age in patients with ED visit due to fall injury/pain was 75 and non-fall injury/pain was 55 years. The most common reasons for chemotherapy induced ED visits were GI related (N=8) and Neutropenic fever (N=7). Cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin was the common regimen associated with neutropenic fever. A total of 72 (44%) visits resulted in hospital admissions. Most common symptom categories requiring hospital admissions were cardiac (82.3%), sepsis/cellulitis (81.8%), respiratory (64%), cancer related pain (54.5%) and GI (50%). Most were on endocrine therapy at the time of their visit (N= 59) and 31 were on no treatment at all. Falls were unrelated to disease or treatment and occurred in patients above age 70. Visits occurred during working hours from 6AM to 5PM, with peak incidence on Mondays and Fridays. Conclusions: Reducing ED visit in cancer patients is a worthwhile endeavor particularly in the context of the COVID pandemic. The main reason for ED visits were falls and injuries that were unrelated to disease or treatment in breast cancer patients. As a result, we are implementing systematic physical therapy assessment for our breast cancer population over age of 60 at our cancer center and call us first campaign, to get an opportunity to intervene prior to going to the ED as majority of the ED visits occurred during working hours.","Patwari, A.; Bhatlapenumarthi, V.; Brann, C.; Waldrip, J.; Caruso, V.; Curtis, A.; Chodkiewicz, C.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,669,30

In the ensemble model, the features of the four images are combined to make a final prediction and, since not every patient possess all types of images, the model is also robust against missing information, which is crucial in these types of models. Although the dataset used is very noisy, the presented system has shown the desired robustness and offers relevant results, showing that ensemble models can generalize better over the data, which leads to a higher accuracy.

However, the delay and/or termination of elective surgery created additional problems, both for patients and the healthcare system. Discontinuation of elective surgery can cause a risk of a backlog;increasing patient morbidity and mortality;poorer quality of life;affecting finances and hospital resources, as well as training and research programs.

Views: In this study, the authors collected data on nutrients that support traditional drug treatment and potentially reduce central nervous system infections, while also indicating the role they play in the central nervous system (CNS). The article points out that long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids, probiotics and prebiotics, as well as vitamin D selenium and zinc play a role in supporting immune function and reducing the risk of CNS infections. It should be noted that, due to the novel nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, limited number of studies evaluating the potential impact of dietary components on COVID-19 risk reduction or their adjunctive effect on treatment are available. Therefore, further clinical studies are needed to confirm these results. Conclusions: The dietary habits and nutrients described in the article support medical care, including vaccination and other therapies. They are likely to reduce the risk of CNS SARS-CoV-2 infection. The functioning of the physiological gut-brain axis supported by probiotics, polyphenols, certain minerals such as zinc, selenium and vitamin D consumed with the diet, can probably reduce the cost of COVID-19 treatment on the CNS.

In the current environment, which is full of uncertainty, many companies have seen their profits decrease, and even the permanence of their businesses endangered due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In such an environment, it is even more necessary to take into account the customer’s opinion about the service received, since once the customer makes use of the hotel’s services, he/she will recommend the hotel to third parties if he/she is satisfied with it. Through customer satisfaction and subsequent recommendations, the hotel thus obtains new clients and retains old ones. This feedback from the client allows for understanding their priorities in order to jointly design a tailor-made service. It is for this reason that this research has been carried out to analyze the service attributes evaluated by customers. In order to achieve the proposed objectives, a survey instrument was used, as well as a longitudinal study procedure applying logistic regression over a period of one year. The descriptive results and the logistic regression show the level of customer satisfaction with the service and the importance given to each of the selected attributes. In this way, the research shows in which areas innovation strategies should be sought. Although the research offers a model composed of five attributes to measure satisfaction through recommendation with a probability of more than fifty percent, it is necessary to take into account the limitations of the current environment due to COVID-19 or the possibility of extending the multidimensionality of the model. It is necessary to continue to work through open innovation platforms to keep contact with the customer and to update the examined attributes in order to obtain customer satisfaction and feedback. © 2021 by the authors.

For example, if you suddenly notice you are about to step on a tack and would prefer not to, the ability to halt your ongoing movement is critical. To address limitations in existing approaches for studying your ability to rapidly terminate your movement (“stopping”), we developed a novel stop task. This task requires termination of ongoing motor programs, provides a direct measure of SSRT, and allows for comparison of the same behavior (stopping) in conditions that elicit either prepared or reactive inhibitory control. Here, we present and evaluate our novel Continuous Movement Stop Task (CMST). We examined several versions of the task in a total of 49 participants. Our data reveal that the CMST is effectively able to dissociate stopping behavior between the planned and unplanned conditions. Additionally, within the subset of participants for which we measured speed, we found that participants initiated stopping (with respect to the stop signal) significantly earlier on planned stop compared to unplanned stop trials. Finally, participants took longer to arrive at full motor arrest (i.e. SSRT) following stop initiation on planned than on unplanned stop trials. This novel task design will enable a more precise quantification of stopping behavior and, in conjunction with neuroscientific methods, could provide more rigorous characterization of brain networks underlying stopping.","Schultz, Kelsey E.; Denning, Dominique; Hufnagel, Vanessa; Swann, Nicole",bioRxiv,669,16

Regionalizing diets and increasing food self-sufficiency contribute greatly to shortening food supply chains and, therefore, to increasing the resilience of the food system. Simultaneously, food supply disturbances can offer a chance for food system transition toward implementing sustainable management practices in agriculture (e.g. organic farming), increasing the sustainability of food production. In this study, we have proposed a foodshed for the cities of Vienna and Bristol, delineating the spatial extent for such a regionalization and self-sufficiency discussion. We used the Metropolitan Foodshed and Self-sufficiency Scenario model to assess the potential self-sufficiency of these areas under different pathways involving more sustainable and resilient food system scenarios by distinguishing: i) The regionalization, ii) production system, iii) food losses and wastage, and iv) population growth until 2050. Furthermore, we have found the main local food policies and studies involving both cities, linking them to the current self-sufficiency levels and proposing pathways to increase them. Our results suggest that the foodsheds proposed are suitable to achieve a high degree of potential self-sufficiency when shifting consumers’ behavior toward sustainably produced regional products, and reducing food wastes in households and food losses in agriculture. This should be accompanied in parallel by an increase in the diversification of regional crop production managed sustainably. We call for the adoption of the foodshed approach – based on the concept of sustainable city region food systems – so that it can be integrated into the food policies to increase food self-sufficiency sustainably.","Vicente-Vicente, José Luis Doernberg Alexandra Zasada Ingo Ludlow David Staszek Damian Bushell Joanna Hainoun Ali Loibl Wolfgang Piorr Annette",Environmental Science &amp; Policy,669,16

Additionally, along with the spread of streaming media, people are spending more and more time on TVs, and Internet Media, leaving less time for exercise, which is an essential factor in promoting healthy life. Current indoor exercising devices are either not fully integrated with the household environment or cannot let people exercise while watching TV. Thus, this paper introduces an electric arm training apparatus, including a housing, an arms training drive structure, an assembly matching structure and a microprocessor, said housing having an arms training drive structure mounted inside, and an assembly matching structure fixed to a lower end face of the housing, said housing having an operating structure at one end, and a mobile phone paired code at one side of the surface of the operating structure, and a voice broadcast being set above the mobile phone paired code. The device is equipped with a training drive structure that allows the user to rewind the connecting rope and handle. The training drive structure allows the user to reel in the stretched cord and handle, thus ensuring that the trainer's arm is contracted and stretched in a cyclic manner, and the assembly and matching structure allows the device to be easily interfaced with the customizable external mounting bracket - the ability to increase the diversity of device assemblies. © 2021 IEEE.","Teng, D.; Yue, Y.; Huang, X.","3rd World Symposium on Artificial Intelligence, WSAI 2021",669,1

Online panic is often manifested earlier than in the real world, leading to an aggravated social response from citizens. This paper conducts sentiment analysis on more than 80,000 comments about COVID-19 obtained from the Chinese Internet and identifies patterns within them. Based on this analysis, we propose an agent-based model consisting of two parts—a revised SEIR model to simulate an offline epidemic and a scale-free network to simulate the Internet community. This model is then used to analyze the effects of the social distancing policy. Assuming the existence of such a policy, online panic is simulated corresponding to different informatization levels. The results indicate that increased social informatization levels lead to substantial online panic during disease outbreaks. To reduce the economic impact of epidemics, we discuss different strategies for releasing information on the epidemic. Our conclusions indicate that announcing the number of daily new cases or the number of asymptomatic people following the peak of symptomatic infections could help to reduce the intensity of online panic and delay the peak of panic. In turn, this can be expected to keep social production more orderly and reduce the impact of social responses on the economy.","Guo, Linjiang Yang Li Sheng Dongfang",Complexity,669,20

Although research addressing this specific question does not exist, we are able to formulate an informed view based on the extensive deception literature. Since nonverbal signs of deception in the face and body are virtually absent, we conclude that medical face mask-wearing or virtual courtroom proceedings will not hamper jurors’ lie detection abilities.

Amid a collective ‘will to include’, this Debate adopts an infrastructural lens to decipher the distributive and governance implications of the complex institutional, financial and digital linkages through which informal workers and consumers are being included in the circuits of contemporary market economies. Looking beyond imaginaries of seamless linkages, the articles in this Debate examine the specific processes through which these inclusive connections engage with informal actors, focusing on how they work and for whom. Articles focus on various types of inclusive infrastructures that connect deprived communities to jobs, resources and social citizenship, ranging from social protection systems to employment linkages and services for hard‐to‐reach populations. With a view to cutting through the ideological blurring of inclusive discourses, this Introduction will examine the strategies of legibility and regulatory restructuring effected through inclusive infrastructures. It reveals the hidden politics of inclusive linkages, reflects on the techniques of governance operating through socio‐technical connections, and examines processes of resistance and failed connections reworking inclusive infrastructures from below.

Previous studies have addressed this question by estimating the average effect of democracy on early-life mortality across all countries. We revisit this debate using a research design that distinguishes between the aggregated effects of democracy across all countries and their individual effects within countries. Using Interrupted Time Series methodology and estimating model parameters in a Bayesian framework, we find the average effect of democracy on early-life mortality to be close to zero, but with considerable variation at the country-level. Democratization was followed by fewer child deaths in 21 countries, an increase in deaths in eight, and no measurable changes in the remaining 32 cases. Transitions were usually beneficial in Europe, neutral or beneficial in Africa and Asia, and neutral or harmful in Latin America. The distribution of country-level effects is not consistent with common arguments about the conditional effects of democratic transitions.

Design/methodology/approach: A prospective controlled trial was conducted at a Thai field hospital and included patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were over the age of 18 and able to use an online communication application. Patients were free to decide whether to participate in the online group. The group provided a space for participants to communicate with each other and a mental health service team. The everyday activities were designed to enable group support via texting or livestreaming through the LINE application. Psychoeducation via video clips or articles regarding stress management were provided. Outcomes were measured by an online self-reported questionnaire based on the twenty-one-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) on the first and fourteenth day of admission to the field hospital. Findings: Forty-six patients participated in this study. Forty participants completed the secondary assessment, with 21 in the intervention group and 19 in the control group. From multilevel mixed-effects regression analysis, adjusted for gender, age and education, participation in the intervention group significantly decreased total DASS scores and anxiety subdomain scores compared to those in the control group (p = 0.038 and 0.008). Originality/value: The online psychological support group offered benefits for patients with COVID-19 who were isolated in the field hospital. It could be an effective alternative measure to distribute psychological care during a pandemic situation.

When this probability crosses 0.95 an outbreak can be declared over with 95% confidence. Our method is easy to compute, only requires knowledge of the incidence curve and the serial interval distribution, and evaluates the statistical lifetime of the outbreak of interest. Using this approach, we rigorously show how the time-varying under-reporting of infected cases will artificially inflate the inferred probability of elimination and hence lead to early (false- positive) end-of-epidemic declarations. Contrastingly, we prove that incorrectly identifying imported cases as local will deceptively decrease this probability, resulting in late (false-negative) declarations. Failing to sustain intensive surveillance during the later phases of an epidemic can therefore substantially mislead policymakers on when it is safe to remove travel bans or relax quarantine and social distancing advisories. World Health Organisation guidelines recommend fixed (though disease-specific) waiting times for end-of-epidemic declarations that cannot accommodate these variations. Consequently, there is an unequivocal need for more active and specialised metrics for reliably identifying the conclusion of an epidemic.","Parag, K. V.; Donnelly, C. A.; Jha, R.; Thompson, R.

Poisonous eggs from Pomacea apple snails have defensive macromolecules for protection. Here we isolated and characterized a novel lectin called PdPV1 that is massively accumulated in the eggs of Pomacea diffusa and seems part of its protective cocktail. The native protein, an oligomer of ca. 256 kDa, has high structural stability, withstanding 15 min boiling and denaturing by sodium dodecyl sulphate. It resists in vitro proteinase digestion and displays structural stability between pH 2.0–12.0 and up to 85 °C. These properties, as well as its subunit sequences, glycosylation pattern, presence of carotenoids, size, and global shape resemble those of its orthologs from other Pomacea. Further, like members of the canaliculata clade, PdPV1 is recovered unchanged in faeces of mice ingesting it, supporting an antinutritive defensive function. PdPV1 also displays a strong hemagglutinating activity specifically recognizing selected ganglioside motifs with high affinity. This activity is only shared with PsSC, a perivitelline from the same clade (bridgesii clade). As a whole, these results indicate that species in the genus Pomacea have diversified their eggs defences: Those from the bridgesii clade are protected mostly by non-digestible lectins that lower the nutritional value of eggs, in contrast with protection by neurotoxins of other Pomacea clades, indicating apple snail egg defensive strategies are clade-specific. The harsh gastrointestinal environment of predators would have favoured their appearance, extending by convergent evolution the presence of plant-like highly stable lectins, a strategy not reported in other animals.

OBJECTIVES: The main objective was to evaluate the feasibility of using OC as the main source of 02 for intensive care patients. We assess the need to use pressurized 02 during the ICU hospitalization. The secondary objectives were to identify the causes of the use of pressurized 02. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We realize an interventional cohort study at the French role 3 hospitals located in the Republic of Djibouti. The criteria of inclusion were all patients aged over 18 years, requiring oxygen and admitted to intensive care. RESULTS: We include 35 patients over 6-month period for 251 days of oxygenation, including 142 days of invasive mechanical ventilation. The population include 21 (60%) men, aged of 35 (30 - 49) years. Twenty-eight (80%) patients benefits of invasive ventilation. Median 02 administration duration was 6 (3-10) days, and the median duration of mechanical ventilation was 3 (1-5) days.

This pathway is activated by interleukin 6 (IL-6), a major mediator of the cytokine storm during shock. To determine its role in the vascular response to shock, we challenged mice lacking SOCS3 in the adult endothelium (SOCS3iEKo) with a non-lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). SOCS3iEKo mice died 16-24 hours post-injection after severe kidney failure. Loss of SOCS3 led to an LPS-induced type I interferon-like program, and high expression of pro-thrombotic and pro-adhesive genes. Consistently, we observed intraluminal leukocyte adhesion and NETosis, as well as retinal venular leukoembolization. Notably, heterozygous mice displayed an intermediate phenotype, suggesting a gene dose effect. In vitro studies were performed to study the role of SOCS3 protein levels in the regulation of the inflammatory response. In HUVEC, pulse-chase experiments showed that SOCS3 protein has a half-life below 20 minutes. Inhibition of SOCS3 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation leads to protein accumulation and a stronger inhibition of IL-6 signaling and barrier function loss. Together, our data demonstrates that the regulation of SOCS3 protein levels is critical to inhibit IL-6-mediated endotheliopathy during shock and provides a promising new therapeutic avenue to prevent MODS though stabilization of endothelial SOCS3.

Methods: Sera from 59 vaccinees were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and virus-neutralising antibodies (VNA) with four IgG assays, a surrogate neutralisation test (sVNT) and a Vero cell-based neutralisation test (cVNT) before and after heterologous (n=31 and 42) or homologous booster vaccination (AZD1222/AZD1222, n=8/9; BNT162b2/BNT162b2, n=8/8). The strength of IgG binding to separate SARS-CoV-2 antigens was measured as avidity. Results: After the first vaccination, prevalence of IgGs antibodies directed against (trimeric) SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)- protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) varied from 55-95 % (AZD1222) to 100% (BNT162b2), depending on the vaccine used and the SARS-CoV-2 antigen used. The booster vaccination resulted in 100 percent seroconversion and appearance of highly avid IgG as well as VNA against a SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (alpha; B.1.1.7) used as antigen in the cVNT. The results of the sVNT basically agree with those of our in-house cVNT, but the sVNT seems to overestimate non- and weakly virus-neutralizing titres. The mean IgG and VNA titres were higher after heterologous vaccination compared to the homologous AZD1222 scheme. Conclusions: The heterologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination leads to a strong antibody response with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and VNA titres at a level comparable to that of a homologous BNT162b2 vaccination scheme. Irrespectively of the chosen immunisation regime, highly avid IgG antibodies can be detected just two weeks after the second vaccine dose indicating the development of a robust humoral immunity.","Rose, R.; Neumann, F.; Grobe, O.; Lorentz, T.; Fickenscher, H.; Krumbholz, A.",,669,11

Its expression induces a physical alteration of surface adhesion molecules, which causes cell rounding and detachment of the infected cells. This phenomenon likely plays a crucial role in viral pathogenicity. In this study, we show that such morphological changes are cell line-dependent as well as dependent on the surface proteins that interact with EBOV-GP in cis and trans. We have generated data showing that natural killer (NK) cell receptors (NCRs: NKp44 and NKp46), selectins (CD62E/P/L) and inhibitory Siglecs function as receptors for Ebola-GP and human papilloma virus (HPV-L1). We used HEK293 cells transfected with Ebola-GP and recombinant fusion proteins containing the extracellular domain of each of these receptors linked to the Fc of human IgG1, which showed significant differences in their virus-binding behavior compared to HEK293 cells transfected with empty vector. Further, to demonstrate that EBOV-GP is a ligand for NKp44 and other NK-receptors, and to investigate their role in immune escape, we also used human HEK-293, HeLa- and hamster CHO-GP-transfectants. Our data show that the NK receptors NKp44 and NKp46 play a key role in recognizing EBOV (Ebolavirus) and strongly suggest that other inhibitory (Siglec-7, Siglec-5) and non-inhibitory homing receptors (P-Selectin, L-Selectin, E-Selectin, and DC-SIGNR/DC-SIGN) take part in the interaction with virus particles. In addition, we show that NKp44, and NKp46, Siglec-7, and -5, and P-, L-, E-selectins as well as of and DC-SIGNR/DC-SIGN bind to the artificial viral envelope of a lentiviral vector that contains EBOV-GP. Altogether we prove that NCRs and a range of other inhibitory and activating receptors can interact with viral envelope/capsid proteins and that such interaction could play an important role in the elimination of virus infected cells. Our findings could be used to develop new strategies for prevention and treatment of infections by these viruses. Author summary The innate immune system is able to recognize specifically certain virus components. Here we show that activating NK-cell receptors (NKp44, and NKp46) are involved in such interaction by using HEK293 and CHOK1 cells transfected with the Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) and by binding studies with purified EBOV-GP. In detail, we have found moderate to strong affinity of Siglecs (Siglec-7, and -5), selectins (P-, L-, E-Selectin) and DC-SIGNR/DC-SIGN to purified EBOV-GP, and to cells transfected with EBOV-GP as well as to the envelope of a lentiviral vector carrying the EBOV-GP. Our findings show that NKp44, and NKp46, Siglec-7, and -5, as well as P-and L-selectins have a strong affinity to EBOV-G.","Jarahian, Mostafa; Marstaller, Katharina; Wurmbäck, Heribert; Banna, Nadine; Ahani, Roshanak; Etemadzadeh, Hossein; Boller, Lea Katharina; Azadmanesh, Kayhan; Cid-Arregui, Angel; Berger, Martin R; Momburg, Frank; Watzl, Carsten",bioRxiv,669,20

In particular, to consider how to hold mass gathering events, it is important to clarify how the local infection prevalence, the number of spectators, the capacity proportion, and the implementation of preventions affect the infection risk. In this study, we used an environmental exposure model to analyse the relationship between infection risk and infection prevalence, the number of spectators, and the capacity proportion at mass gathering events in football and baseball games. In addition to assessing risk reduction through the implementation of various preventive measures, we assessed how face-mask-wearing proportion affects infection risk. Furthermore, the model was applied to estimate the number of infectors who entered the stadium and the number of newly infected individuals, and to compare them with actual reported cases. The model analysis revealed an 86%-95% reduction in the infection risk due to the implementation of face-mask wearing and hand washing. Among the individual measures, face-mask wearing was particularly effective, and the infection risk increased as the face-mask-wearing proportion decreased. A linear relationship was observed between infection risk at mass gathering events and the infection prevalence. Furthermore, the number of newly infected individuals was also dependent on the number of spectators and the capacity proportion independent of the infection prevalence, confirming the importance of considering spectator capacity in infection risk management. These results highlight that it is beneficial for organisers to ensure prevention compliance and to mitigate or limit the number of spectators according to the prevalence of local infection. Both the estimated and reported numbers of newly infected individuals after the events were small, below 10 per 3-4 million spectators, despite a small gap between these numbers.","Yasutaka, T.; Murakami, M.; Iwasaki, Y.; Naito, W.; Onishi, M.; Fujita, T.; Imoto, S.",,669,2

Data was obtained by the attendant physician. 668 patients were included, the median age was 54 years, and 42.7% were female. Male sex and older age were associated with COVID 19 disease and more strongly with severity. Most frequent symptoms were fever and cough followed by dyspnoea, myalgia, odynophagia, headache, anosmia, and diarrhoea. Nonsevere patients had more upper respiratory symptoms while severe patients had mainly lower respiratory symptoms on admission. Most common comorbidities were arterial hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. A great proportion of patients had normal thorax X ray and ground-glass opacity in tomography. In severe patients, radiography and tomography had a predominant ground glass pattern, but normal radiography and tomography on presentation were present in 22% and 5.9%, respectively. The absence of fever and normal radiology on admission neither excluded the disease nor further severity. PCR elevation was related with COVID 19 disease and with severity, while lymphopenia was more related with the disease and leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia with severity. 8, 4% of patients were health care workers.

While genetic programs controlling Tfh cell differentiation have been extensively studied using murine models, studies in humans have been hampered by the lack of a robust in vitro differentiation system for Tfh cells. We characterized epigenomic landscapes across stages of Tfh cell differentiation in a healthy human tonsil using ATAC-Seq and CUT&RUN for selected histone modifications. We combined these epigenomic datasets and integrated them with the reference human protein interactome using a novel network propagation approach. Our approach uncovered subnetworks integral to Tfh cell differentiation. These subnetworks captured known Tfh cell drivers to a greater extent than conventional gene-centric analyses would, and also revealed novel modules that may be required for Tfh cell differentiation. We find that human Tfh cell subnetworks are functionally associated with specific immune signaling cascades including cytokine receptor driven pathways. Analyses of transcriptomic data revealed that in addition to these immune pathways being significantly dysregulated in severe COVID-19, the corresponding Tfh cell subnetworks are also transcriptionally perturbed to a similar extent. This provides a molecular mechanistic basis for the previously observed impaired Tfh cell differentiation and loss of germinal centers in severe COVID-19.","Mahajan, Vinay S; Rahman, Syed A; Viswanadham, Vinayak V; Yuen, Grace J; Sun, Na; Mattoo, Hamid; Pillai, Shiv S; Das, Jishnu",bioRxiv,669,1

This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.","Rainisio, M.",,669,1

With the use of situational management, decision making can be improved to better suit the considered situation. Since the conditions for the development of a pandemic are difficult to predict, situational management becomes important. Taking into account psychological and behavioral factors makes the situation model more accurate and realistic. The paper proposes the use of coalition games for situational management during the hospitalization of sick patients. The game players and coalition participants are hospitals, ambulance teams, patients, and computed tomography centers. The goal of the game is to form a coalition of participants that gives the maximum payoff, which is assessed on the basis of minimizing the time to make a decision. The general scheme of hospitalization, the main sources of information about the situation, the formulation and formalization of the problem are considered.

Due to the small amount of data and the lack of proven models for the development of the situation, heuristic models of the situation development were formed for conducting experiments, based on the analysis of information from open information sources.

However, existing vaccines do not prevent new infections, and vaccinated individuals can spread the infection as intensely as unvaccinated ones. Therefore, it is too early to lift quarantine restrictions in Europe and most other countries. The constant appearance of new cases due to re-infection increases the likelihood of new coronavirus strains, including very dangerous. As existing vaccines are not able to prevent this, it remains to increase the number of tests per registered case.

Methods Female dancers from a ballet company completed a published online dance-specific health questionnaire. Over the study period, dancers recorded wellbeing and training metrics, with menstrual cycle tracking and blood tests. For menstrual cycle hormones AI-based techniques modelled hormone variation over a cycle, based on capillary blood samples taken at two time points. At regular, virtual, clinical interviews with each dancer, findings were discussed, and personalised advice given. Results 14 female dancers (mean age 25.5 years, SD 3.7) participated in the study. 10 dancers recorded positive scores on the dance health questionnaire, suggesting a low risk of relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S). 2 dancers were taking hormonal contraception. Apart from 1 dancer, those not on hormonal contraception reported current eumenorrhoeic status. The initiative of monitoring menstrual cycles and application of AI to model menstrual cycle hormones found that subclinical hormone disruption was occurring in 6 of the 10 dancers reporting regular cycles. 4 of the 6 dancers who received personalised advice, showed improved menstrual hormone function, including one dancer who had planned pregnancy.

The aim of the present article is to report the adaptation of the Medically Necessary Time-Sensitive (MeNTS) scoring system to triage patients who were awaiting urological elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The present study was conducted as a part of a necessary transition of care delivery at a tertiary care institution in order to re-establish urological elective surgery. We triaged all urological elective surgeries with the MeNTS instrument and proposed a cutoff value of 45 points to avoid complications in the COVID-19 crisis while resuming elective procedures. Results A total of 91 patients awaiting elective urological surgery pending to be rescheduled were identified. Their median age was 60.5 years old (interquartile range [IQR]: 46-93). Twenty-five patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I, 51 (56%) were class II, and 12 (13%) were class III. The median MeNTS score was 42 points (IQR: 36-59).

In recent years, with the availability of formulations that allow for total dose infusion, the role of intravenous iron (IVI) has become increasingly appreciated as a rapid, reliable, and safe strategy in addressing IDA. Historically, at our institution and at many others, the path to IVI treatment entails initial referral to hematology, a face-to-face evaluation at a hematology clinic, followed by scheduling for infusion on another visit. The median time from referral to infusion is approximately 35 days, with timing of infusions determined not by clinical considerations, but by chair availability and the whims of non-clinical personnel entrusted with the scheduling. Inappropriate delays are common, and of practical import when occurring, say, in pregnant women approaching their due dates, or patients scheduled for surgery. With the purpose of expediting the above process, capitalizing on a robust e-consult platform already operational at our institution, e-IRON was made available to referring providers as a function in the EPIC EMR, that facilitates an ‘electronic’ referral to hematology, for consideration for IVI. A template-based design ensures that all information required (indication, experience with oral iron, current lab-work, etc.) is included. Following the institutional protocol for e-consults, e-IRON referrals are ‘chart-reviewed’ by a specialist hematologist within 3 business days, and a determination regarding IVI is made. If deemed appropriate, the patient is scheduled for infusion within 10 business days. The specialist also specifies whether a face-to-face hematology appointment is required, and in cases where IVI is not deemed appropriate, will provide guidance as to alternate management. Results During the initial 75 day evaluation period 81 e-IRON referral were received. Indications are listed in table 1, and responses in table 2. The largest subgroup of referrals was from the prenatal clinics, likely as a result of a proactive protocol for management of IDA in pregnancy adopted by the department of obstetrics in conjunction with hematology. Of note, IVI was approved and scheduled for 60 of 81 (74%) patients, of which only 2 were required to be seen by hematology. Reasons for non-approval of IVI varied, but the most common reason cited was an inadequate trial of oral iron, in which case specific instructions were provided for oral iron supplementation. In one notable case, wherein a referred patient's anemia was felt to be discordant with his degree of iron deficiency, a more extensive workup was recommended resulting in a diagnosis of previously unsuspected myeloma. Recommendations were generated within 3 business days for 77 (95%) consults and in 1 day for 47 (58%). Recommended IVI regimens all entailed 1 or 2 infusion days, depending on the estimated iron deficit, and all first infusions were scheduled within 2 weeks of the request. Conclusion The e-IRON pilot project demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of a telemedicine approach in triaging, and expediting the management of patients requiring IVI. Using a template-based e-consult platform, reviewing hematologists are in the vast majority of cases able to rapidly determine appropriate management, and facilitate IVI when appropriate. The platform ensures effective supervision by specialist hematologists, but dispenses with the laborious, costly, and time consuming traditional requirement of a face-to-face visit to the hematology clinic. The value of this paradigm shift in patient care is underscored by lessons learned during the ongoing COVID19 pandemic.

Antimicrobial resistance arises when microbial agentssuch as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites alter their behaviour to make current conventional medicines inefficient. Vaccination is one of the most effective strategies to fight antimicrobial resistance. Vaccines, unlike drugs, are less likely to produce resistance since they are precise to their target illnesses. Vaccines against infectious agents such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae have already been shown to reduce tolerance to antimicrobial medications;however, vaccines against some antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, nosocomial infections, and pulmonary and diarrheal disease viruses require more research and development.

Methods: A survey was conducted among 335 subjects diagnosed with BS and followed at Careggi University Hospital. Moreover, we conducted a case-control study. Cases were described in term of SARS-CoV-2 manifestation and prognosis, changes in disease activity, and in pharmacological therapies. Sars-CoV-2 negative controls matched 1:3 by sex, age and disease duration ± 5 years were randomly selected. Results: Out of 335 BS patients, 12 declared to have/have had SARS-CoV-2 infection (3.6%). Eight were females (median age of 40 years), with a median duration of BS disease of 6 years;five had active disease. Nine patients reported fever, 9 myalgia/arthralgia, 5 gastrointestinal symptoms, 5 anosmia/ageusia, 5 cough, 3 headache, 3 fatigue, 2 breathlessness, panic attacks and dizziness (one each). Before infection, patients were treated with corticosteroids, colchicine, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), traditional DMARDs [azathioprine (n patients = 4), methotrexate (n=1)], and biologics DMARDs [adalimumab (n=6), infliximab (n=2), secukinumab (n=1), and canakinumab (n=1)]. Therapy was suspended for a median time of 33 days in 9patients and resumed after a median time of 5 days from negativation. Regarding SARS-CoV-2 treatment, most patients started or increased corticosteroids, whereas heparin and antipyretic drugs were used in 4 and 5 patients, respectively. Cases were comparable to controls in terms of disease manifestations, activity, and immunomodulating therapy, with the only exception of corticosteroids, whose daily dose was significantly higher in cases (Table 1). Conclusion: Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among Italian BS patients is 3.6%, similarly to the Italian general population (4.2%). Disease activity at time of infection was not associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most patients interrupted biologic DMARDs. However, use of DMARDs, seemed not to be associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while higher doses of corticosteroids resulted to be more common among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to controls. No patient required hospitalization or died. Our experience shows encouraging data about BS patients who do not appear be at greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or complications than the general population.","Mattioli, I.; Bettiol, A.; Urban, M.

A handful of static structures now provide molecular insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV interact with its host target, which is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Molecular recognition, binding and function are dynamic processes. To evaluate this, multiple all atom molecular dynamics simulations of at least 500 ns each were performed to better understand the structural stability and interfacial interactions between the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bound to ACE2. Several contacts were observed to form, break and reform in the interface during the simulations. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilizes unique strategies to achieve stable binding to ACE2. Several differences were observed between the residues of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that consistently interacted with ACE2. Notably, a stable salt bridge between Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Asp30 of ACE2 as well as three stable hydrogen bonds between Tyr449, Gln493, and Gln498 of SARS-CoV-2 and Asp38, Glu35, and Lys353 of ACE2 were observed, which were absent in the SARS-CoV-ACE2 interface. Some previously reported residues, which were suggested to enhance the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2, were not observed to form stable interactions in these simulations. Stable binding to the host receptor is crucial for virus entry. Therefore, special consideration should be given to these stable interactions while designing potential drugs and treatment modalities to target or disrupt this interface.","Ali, Amanat; Vijayan, Ranjit",bioRxiv,669,1

Experimental methods used to determine BCEs are costly and time-consuming. It thus becomes essential to develop computational methods for the rapid identification of BCEs. Though several computational methods have been developed for this task, cross-testing of classifiers trained and tested on different datasets revealed their limitations, with accuracies of 51 to 53%. Results We describe a new method called EpitopeVec, which utilizes residue properties, modified antigenicity scales, and a Protvec representation of peptides for linear BCE prediction with machine learning techniques. Evaluating on several large and small data sets, as well as cross-testing demonstrated an improvement of the state-of-the-art performances in terms of accuracy and AUC. Predictive performance depended on the type of antigen (viral, bacterial, eukaryote, etc.).

It is important to identify factors which are related to this increase.ObjectivesIn present study we investigated how perceived value threat of Covid-19 is related to anxiety and depression symptoms in April – May 2020 during the lockdown in Russia.MethodsThree hundred and four participants were recruited online (Mage=33.18, SD=13.33, 108 males, 194 females). Participants completed the Short Schwartz’s Value Survey (SSVS;Lindeman & Verkasalo, 2010). They were next asked to rate how likely their values could be threatened because of the Covid-19. They also completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1983) and Beck Depression Inventory-II (Beck et al., 1996).ResultsA multiple linear regression model was built to assess how own values and values threatened by Covid-19 explain state anxiety during the lockdown. Threat to openness values was positively related to state anxiety (b=1.07, SE=.49, β=.13, p=.032). Threat to conservation values was only marginally related to state anxiety (b=1.03, SE=.58, β=.13, p=.074). The effects of self-enhancement and self-transcendence values were not significant.ConclusionsWhen Covid-19 is perceived as a threat to openness to change values – hedonism, stimulation and self-direction – people experience higher level of anxiety symptoms. Interestingly, perceived threat of Covid-19 to security, conformity and tradition was only marginally related to anxiety. Future studies might explore how encouraging people to fulfill their openness to change values in a safe mode might decrease the level of anxiety.","Fyodorova, E.; Arina, G.; Iosifyan, M.",European Psychiatry,669,1

Many such tools provide users the ability to search for specific entities (e.g. proteins, diseases) by tracking their mentions in papers.

Machine learning models have been developed to facilitate the semantic indexing of scientific papers. However their performance on the more comprehensive ontologies of biomedical concepts does not reach the levels of typical entity recognition problems studied in NLP. In large part this is due to their low resources, where the ontologies are large, there is a lack of descriptive text defining most entities, and labeled data can only cover a small portion of the ontology. In this paper, we develop a new model that overcomes these challenges by (1) generalizing to entities unseen at training time, and (2) incorporating linking predictions into the mention segmentation decisions.

In contrast, glial cells in the CNS can divide and repopulate themselves under injury or disease conditions. Therefore, many groups around the world have been able to utilize internal glial cells to directly convert them into neurons for neural repair. We have previously demonstrated that ectopic expression of NeuroD1 in dividing glial cells can directly convert reactive glial cells into neurons. However, Wang et al. recently posted an article in bioRxiv challenging the entire field of in vivo glia-to-neuron conversion after using one single highly toxic dose of AAV (2×1013 gc/ml, 1 μl) in the mouse cortex, producing artifacts that are very difficult to interpret. We present data here that reducing AAV dosage to safe level will avoid artifacts caused by toxic dosage. We also demonstrate with Aldh1l1-CreERT2 and Ai14 reporter mice that lineage-traced astrocytes can be successfully converted into NeuN+ neurons after infected by AAV5 GFAP::NeuroD1. Retroviral expression of NeuroD1 further confirms our previous findings that dividing glial cells can be converted into neurons. Together, the incidence of Wang et al. sends an alarming signal to the entire in vivo reprogramming field that the dosage of viral vectors is a critical factor to consider when designing proper experiments. For AAV, we recommend a relatively safe dose of 1×1010 - 1×1012 gc/ml (~1 μl) in the rodent brain for cell conversion experiments addressing basic science questions. For therapeutic purpose under injury or diseased conditions, AAV dosage needs to be adjusted through a series of dose finding experiments. Moreover, we recommend that the AAV results are further verified with retroviruses that mainly express transgenes in dividing glial cells in order to draw solid conclusions.","Chen, Gong; Li, Wen; Xiang, Zongqin; Xu, Liang; Liu, Minhui; Wang, Qingsong; Lei, Wenliang",bioRxiv,669,20

Fluorescence signal and cycle threshold information is critical for the positive and negative detection of target test samples in qPCR systems. To determine viral concentration, the fluorescence intensity of each cycle must be recorded using a qPCR system. In general, the time points of fluorescence excitation and excitation light intensity affect fluorescence intensity. Thus, this study proposed an effective excitation method for enhancing fluorescence intensity. Several parameters, including excitation light intensity, the excitation time point, and the reaction time of the reagent at each temperature stage, were modified in assessing fluorescence performance and determining suitable parameters for fluorescence excitation in a qPCR system. Fluorescence intensity resulted in the most optimal fluorescence performance;specifically, excitation was triggered by using a 30 mA current, and the excitation light was activated when the temperature decreased to 60 °C. Total reaction time was 1 s, and the concentrated fluorescence value and suitable cycle threshold value were obtained. Overall, high efficiency, low fluorescence decay, and high light stability were observed.

Objectives: To analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on RMD patients' and rheumatologists' usage, preferences, and perception of digital health applications (DHAs) in Germany. Methods: A web-based national survey was developed by the Working Group Young Rheumatology of the German Society for Rheumatology and the German League against Rheumatism. The prospective survey was distributed via social media, QR-code, and email. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and regression analyses were performed to show correlations. Results: We analysed the responses of 299 patients and 129 rheumatologists. Most patients (74%) and rheumatologists (76%) believed that DHAs are useful in the management of RMDs and felt confident in their own usage thereof (90%;86%). 38% of patients and 71% of rheumatologists reported that their attitude had changed positively towards DHAs and that their usage had increased due to COVID-19 (29%;48%). The majority in both groups agreed on implementing virtual visits for follow-up appointments in stable disease conditions. The most reported advantages of DHAs were usage independent of time and place (76.6%;77.5%). The main barriers were a lack of information on suitable, available DHAs (58.5%;41.9%), poor usability (42.1% of patients) and a lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of DHAs (23.2% of rheumatologists) (Table 1). Only a minority (<10% in both groups) believed that digitalisation has a negative impact on the patient-doctor relationship. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic instigated an increase in patients' and rheumatologists' acceptance and usage of DHAs, possibly introducing a permanent paradigm shift in the management of RMDs.

The authors examine how lecturers employed a community of inquiry (CoI) in their online classrooms within the context of emergency remote teaching (ERT). The study further aims to ascertain students' feedback concerning current ERT practices at the university toward cultivating a CoI. Doing this would offer more appropriate interventions and support for lecturers and students from, within and for an African context. If not, instructors might risk reproducing and perpetuating the same outdated pedagogies before the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method research design informed by a pragmatist paradigm was used. Primary data were collected from 40 lecturers at the university through online questionnaires of which 10 lecturers responded to e-mail interviews. The original CoI survey was distributed among 150 students in the Faculty of Education at the university. Findings The findings revealed that, despite the rushed and trial nature of the use of ERT, there were instances of a CoI among students. The findings further revealed that the majority of the lecturers were not adequately prepared for ERT as a result of limited experience with asynchronous and synchronous online teaching. There was evidence of an absence of a strong active teaching presence that was found to have negatively influenced the development of social and cognitive presences during ERT. Research limitations/implications Only a single faculty at one university was selected in this single case. Practical implications The results of the study have significant implications for faculties and academic staff who are currently teaching online in response to the teaching challenges paused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings will assist lecturers in developing appropriate pedagogical intervention strategies to enhance strong and active teaching and social presences necessary for cultivating the cognitive presences among students during ERT. Originality/value This is one of the first empirical studies to explore the influence of ERT on the cognitive, social and teaching presences at a university in an African context. The findings and conclusion of the study are novel as they relate to the development of appropriate pedagogical practices and intervention strategies suitable for ERT in response to the current education crisis.","Waghid, Z.; Meda, L.; Chiroma, J.

Yet, it deepened and strengthened over the next few days. In the following week, symptoms accumulated and were strange and fluctuating: an experience with which I would become all too well acquainted in my COVID journey. Two weeks later on a second telemedical appointment a doctor heard me describe the coughing and chest burning I felt—where it almost felt like a sunburn—and told me it sounded like I had COVID. The inhaler she prescribed helped, but I originally dismissed her diagnosis. These were the early days when a test could not be found or taken, so I lacked confirmation that my body would verify to me for the months following through more drastic measures. A year later, after ongoing and prolonged symptoms of costochondritis, fluctuating high heart rates, difficulty breathing, and a multitude of costly hospital and specialist visits—including now being a part of the Post/Long COVID clinic in my state—I am changed.

The immune response via cellular immunity creates superior resistance to viral mutations, which are currently the greatest threat to the global vaccination campaign. Furthermore, we also propose a safer, more facile and physiologically appropriate immunization method using either intra-nasal or oral administration. The underlying technology is an adaptation of synthetic long peptides (SLPs) previously used in cancer immunotherapy. SLPs comprising HLA class I and class II epitopes are used to stimulate antigen cross-presentation and canonical class II presentation by dendritic cells. The result is a cytotoxic T cell-mediated prompt and specific immune response against the virus-infected epithelia and a rapid and robust virus clearance. Peptides isolated from COVID-19 convalescent patients were screened for the best HLA population coverage and were tested for toxicity and allergenicity. 3D peptide folding followed by molecular docking studies provided positive results, suggesting a favourable antigen presentation.","Tîrziu, Alexandru; Păunescu, Virgil",bioRxiv,669,13

The federal-level analysis shows that funding has been marked by diminished support for ""core"" public health functions. The state-level analysis shows tremendous variation in use of state revenues to support public health functions. The combination of these factors results in very different public health capacities across the country, potentially leaving some states more vulnerable, while simultaneously posing a general threat to the nation since public health problems do not honor state borders. On the basis of this analysis, the authors suggest changes in the financing arrangements for public health, designed to assure a more stable funding stream for core public health functions and a more consistent approach to financing public health activities across the country.","Levi, Jeffrey; Juliano, Chrissie; Richardson, Maxwell",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,669,9

Thus far, all of the recombination sites had been localized at the 5' half of the RNA genome. We have now performed a cross between MHV-2, a fusion-negative murine coronavirus, and a temperature-sensitive mutant of the A59 strain of MHV, which is fusion positive at the permissive temperature. By selecting fusion-positive viruses at the nonpermissive temperature, we isolated several recombinants containing multiple crossovers in a single genome. Some of the recombinants became fusion negative during the plaque purification. The fusion ability of the recombinants parallels the presence or absence of the A59 genomic sequences encoding peplomers. Several of the recombinants have crossovers within 3' end genes which encode viral structural proteins, N and E1. These recombination sites were not specifically selected with the selection markers used. This finding, together with results of previous recombination studies, indicates that RNA recombination can occur almost anywhere from the 5' end to the 3' end along the entire genome. The data also show that the replacement of A59 genetic sequences at the 5' end of gene C, which encodes the peplomer protein, with the fusion-negative MHV-2 sequences do not affect the fusion ability of the recombinant viruses. Thus, the crucial determinant for the fusion-inducing capability appears to reside in the more carboxyl portion of the peplomer protein.","Keck, J G; Soe, L H; Makino, S; Stohlman, S A; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,669,4

However, CTL are derived stochastically through the random gene rearrangements to produce T-cell receptors (TCR), and the relative impact of genetic versus stochastic processes on CTL targeting of HIV and immune-driven viral evolution is unclear. Here we evaluate identical twins infected with HIV-1 as neonates from a common blood transfusion, with subsequently similar environmental exposures, thereby allowing controlled comparisons of CTL targeting and viral evolution. Seventeen years after infection, their CTL targeting of HIV-1 was remarkably similar. In contrast, their overall TCR profiles were highly dissimilar, and a dominant epitope was recognized by distinctly different TCR in each twin. Furthermore, their viral epitopes had diverged, and there was ongoing viral phylogenetic divergence between the twins between 12 and 17 years after infection. These results indicate that while CTL targeting is predominately genetically determined, stochastic influences render the interaction of HIV-1 and host immunity, and therefore viral escape and CTL efficacy, unpredictable.","Yang, Otto O; Church, Joseph; Kitchen, Christina M R; Kilpatrick, Ryan; Ali, Ayub; Geng, Yongzhi; Killian, M Scott; Sabado, Rachel Lubong; Ng, Hwee; Suen, Jeffrey; Bryson, Yvonne; Jamieson, Beth D; Krogstad, Paul",Journal of virology,669,11

Pre-clinical medical studies were concomitantly switched to electronic distance learning. OBJECTIVES To explore potential implications of COVID-19 on future pre-clinical medical studies. METHODS We examined responses of pre-clinical medical students to the remote electronic learning in terms of quality of and satisfaction with teaching and technical support, attendance to classes, and the desire to continue electronic learning in the post-epidemic era. A survey of responses from first-year students at the Adelson School of Medicine was conducted. To optimize the reliability of the survey, a single research assistant conducted telephone interviews with each student, using a structured questionnaire concerning aspects of participation and satisfaction with teaching and with technical components of the remote electronic learning. RESULTS With 100% response rate, the students reported high satisfaction with the electronic learning regarding its quality, online interactions, instructions given, technical assistance, and availability of recording for future studies. Most of the students (68.6%) noted a preference to continue < 90% of the learning online in the post-outbreak era. A high level of overall satisfaction and a low rate of technical problems during electronic learning were significantly correlated with the desire to continue online learning (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The high satisfaction and the positive experience with the electronic distance learning imposed by the COVID-19 epidemic implied a successful transition and might induce future changes in pre-clinical medical studies.","Sandhaus, Yoram; Kushnir, Talma; Ashkenazi, Shai",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,669,28

Causal factors of these diseases are important infectious agents and causes of pathological conditions in children, but they are also very important for their parents, as well as for people in their close environment. Greater incidence of infections in infants and young children can be explained in different ways. A cause can be insufficient maturity of their immune system, but also their exposure to infections within collective accommodations (cribs, nurseries, pre-school institutions), where they are, at the same time, exposed to a number of unknown agents. Today, a great emphasis is devoted to the ways and kinds of children's nutrition. The problem of relation between infected young organism and infectious agent itself, is also reflected in a long resistance and excretion of microorganisms in their exterior environment. It is well-known that microorganisms resist and excrete much longer in younger organisms, compared to adults, where their resistance and excretion is much shorter or very rare. Actually, adults have already formed protective immunity against particular infectious agents. It doesn't prevent infections in adults, colonization of pathogens, nor eventual development of disease. Established immunity can shorten the time necessary for excretion of microorganisms in their exterior environment and, if disease gets developed, it is of shorter duration and slower progress.","Zvizdić, Sukrija; Kapić, Elvedina; Hamzić, Sadeta",Bosnian journal of basic medical sciences,669,20

RNA interference (RNAi) is a process in cell to degradation specific target mRNA by double-stranded RNA. In mammalian cells, RNAi can be triggered by short interfering RNA (siRNA). RNA interference of virus-specific genes has emerged as a potential antiviral mechanism. This work evaluated if RNase III-prepared short interfering RNAs can induce specific degradation of SARS-coronavirus mRNAs in human cells. Three of SARS genes, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike and nucleocapsid, were amplified with T7 promoter-flanked primers. Long length double-stranded RNA of these genes were transcribed in vitro and then were cleaved to <30bp length short interfering RNA with E. coli RNase III. These siRNAs were termed esiRNA-R, esiRNA-S and esiRNA-N respectively. RdRp, spike and nucleocapsid DNA fragments were inserted into the plasmid pGL3-Control, obtained plasmids pGL-R, pGL-S and pGL-N can express hybrid mRNAs luciferase-RdRp, spike and -nucleocapsid in cells. Above plasmids and esiRNAs were co-transfected to HEK293F cells with reference plasmid pRL-TK. Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activity were measured. Hybrid mRNAs' abundance was measured using reverse transcription real-time PCR. Firefly luciferase expression of pGL-R was reduced to 13% by esiRNA-R. Expression of pGLS was reduced to 11% by esiRNA-S. Expression of pGL-N was reduced to 40% by esiRNA-N. Control esiRNAs didn't affect luciferase expression; Hybrid mRNAs' abundance was dramatically reduced by corresponding esiRNAs. RNase III-prepared short interfering RNAs induce robust and specific degradation of SARS-coronavirus mRNAs in HEK293F cells. These siRNAs could be used to inhibit SARS-coronavirus in future research.","Zhu, Xu-Dong; Dang, Ying; Feng, Yi; Li, Tao; Huang, Pei-Tang",Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,669,11

SUBJECTS Five hundred and sixty-two women in their first trimester of pregnancy in the high prevalence area and 695 pregnant women in the low prevalence area. RESULTS Women in the high prevalence area had less than half the plasma and RBC folate concentrations (12.2 and 440.0 nmol l- 1, respectively) of women in the low prevalence area (33.5 and 910.4 nmol l- 1, respectively). In the high prevalence area, 40% of rural women were deficient in RBC folate and 50% were deficient in plasma folate; 20% of urban women were deficient in RBC folate and 30% deficient in plasma folate. In contrast, only 4% (RBC folate) and 6% (plasma folate) of rural women, and 2% (RBC folate) and 1% (plasma folate) of urban women, were folate-deficient in the low prevalence area. Less than 10% of rural and about 26% of urban women in the high prevalence area took folic acid periconceptionally, compared with 70% and 60% of women in the low prevalence area. CONCLUSIONS Blood folate deficiency is highly prevalent among pregnant women in an area of China with a very high prevalence of neural tube defects.","Ren, Aiguo; Zhang, Le; Hao, Ling; Li, Zhiwen; Tian, Yihua; Li, Zhu",Public health nutrition,669,10

While healthcare professionals work tirelessly testing for the virus and caring for patients, they too have become casualties of the pandemic. Currently the best way to attempt to curb the spread of the virus, echoed by almost all nation leaders, is to distance ourselves from one another socially or physically. However ideal this may seem, social distancing is not always practical in densely populated lower-income countries with many citizens below the breadline. With the majority of South Africans living in poverty, communities in overcrowded households are unable to distance themselves from one another appropriately. In addition, as a nation we struggle with high HIV and tuberculosis rates, malnutrition and an already overburdened healthcare system, emphasising the extreme vulnerability of our people. These factors, coupled with the fact that many of our healthcare professionals lack the necessary personal protective equipment to prevent them from contracting the virus themselves, highlight the gravity of the damaging repercussions that we may face in the coming months, after the complete national lockdown in force at the time of writing is lifted and we move towards a partial lockdown state. Nationally, there needs to be a shift in mindset towards exploring alternative technology-based preventive measures that may empower the healthcare sector in the long term and enhance social distancing.","Mahomed, S",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,669,24

Although it is a minimally invasive treatment, it is associated with complications, the most common being pneumothorax. Pneumothorax occurs due to the rapid target lobe volume reduction and may be a predictor of clinical benefit despite this complication. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to conduct an exploratory data analysis of patients who developed a pneumothorax following endoscopic valve therapy for emphysema. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study performed a retrospective evaluation of pneumothorax management and the impact of pneumothorax on clinical outcomes in 70 patients following valve therapy in 381 consecutive patients. RESULTS Pneumothorax rate following valve therapy was 18%. Pneumothorax management consisted of chest tube insertion, valve removal, and surgical intervention in 87% (61/70), 44% (31/70), and 19% (13/70) of the patients, respectively. Despite pneumothorax, patients experienced modest but significant improvements in lung function parameters (forced expiratory volume in 1 second: 55±148 mL, residual volume: -390±964 mL, total lung capacity: -348±876; all P<0.05). Persistent lobar atelectasis 3 months after recovering from pneumothorax, which was associated with relevant clinical improvement, was observed in only 21% (15/70) of the patients. CONCLUSION Pneumothorax is a frequent severe complication following valve therapy that requires further intervention. Nevertheless, the pneumothorax does not impair the clinical status in the majority of patients. Patients with lobar atelectasis benefit after recovering from pneumothorax in terms of lung function parameters.","Gompelmann, D; Benjamin, N; Kontogianni, K; Herth, Fjf; Heussel, C P; Hoffmann, H; Eberhardt, R",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,669,1

We screened fecal samples from humans with diarrhea for the presence of torovirus-like particles (TVLPs) by electron microscopy and subsequently used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with bovine torovirus reference reagents to test for the presence of torovirus antigens. To add another selection criterion to this heterologous ELISA, we enriched the TVLPs from the stool specimens by using sucrose density gradients before testing. The results of ELISA and EM correlated significantly, the ELISA having a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 86% (chi-square, P < 0.0001). In the gradient, peaks of ELISA reactivity were found at a buoyant density of 1.16 g/ml and were parallel to those found when using bovine torovirus. Furthermore, in 50% of the ELISA-positive gradients, a hemagglutinin for human group O erythrocytes comigrated with the peaks of ELISA reactivity. We were unable to isolate human TVLPs in human colonic tumor or rectal tumor cells. We cloned and sequenced amplification products obtained by low-stringency polymerase chain reaction amplification using consensus primers mapping to the 3' end of the genome of animal toroviruses, but found no significant homologies with animals torovirus sequences. Rabbits were inoculated with material from the gradient peak fractions of human stool specimens, and their sera were assayed for immunologic comparison with bovine torovirus as a reference. A two-way antigenic cross-reactivity was seen between human TVLP and bovine torovirus reagents when tested by ELISA. The rabbit antisera to human TVLP detected a higher number of electron microscopy-positive stool specimens than did the rabbit antisera to bovine torovirus. The application of these assays and reagents should help to elucidate the roles of TVLPs and toroviruses in diarrheal disease in humans.","Koopmans, M; Petric, M; Glass, R I; Monroe, S S",Journal of clinical microbiology,669,4

METHODS Experience RESULTS: I was managed with Remdesivir, Meropenem, Dexamethasone and Clexane. In the course of the illness, I developed some severe complications including COVID-19 pneumonia and suspected adrenal gland failure. The absence of known predisposing and underlining factors in this case made it unconventional COVID-19 presentation. CONCLUSION We conclude that the presentation with the four stages of COVID-19 including suspected adrenal gland failure is a rare phenomenon.

Initial and persistent respiratory resistance, choking sensation, and discomfort in the mouth and nose areas were recorded for the three different nasal plugs, the N-95 respirator and a surgical mask. Nasal plugs were more convenient and better tolerated than the masks. The ability of the nasal plug material to prevent infection by droplet transmission was also tested. A piece of each material was placed on a blood agar plate, the volunteer coughed onto the plate and the material was removed. Bacterial colonies only grew in the areas not previously covered by the nasal plug material. The cotton ball nasal plug is probably as effective as the N-95 respirator or surgical masks at preventing infection, and is much cheaper.","Huang, J T",The Journal of international medical research,669,16

METHODS Anesthesia was induced by intramuscular administration of ketamine and xylazine followed by infusion of lactated Ringer's solution also containing ketamine and xylazine. Group A rabbits (n = 9) were subjected to multiple anesthesias and were evaluated by echocardiography, thoracic radiography, electrocardiography, determination of serum coronavirus titer, vitamin E concentration, and complete necropsy. Prior to a single acute procedure followed by necropsy, group B rabbits (n = 11) were evaluated by echocardiography only. Group C rabbits (n = 10) had never been anesthetized and were necropsied after euthanasia. Group D rabbits (n = 5) had intermediate anesthesia exposure history and were evaluated by echocardiography only. Myocardial fibrosis was scored semi-quantitatively on a scale of 0 to 4. RESULTS Canine coronavirus test results were negative; hypovitaminosis E was evident, and fibrosis scores were significantly increased in group A, compared with group B or group C, rabbits.

Results: this study showed that orthopaedic surgery plan management was adapted to respond more effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining the continuity of health care and ensuring protection of medical staff and patients. Among the introduced measures, elective surgery was postponed to free-up beds for suspected or COVID-19 positive patients requiring hospitalization. Additionally, the number of outpatient visits was considerably decreased and non-urgent visits were postponed to reduce the flow of patients in and out of hospitals and therefore minimize the risk of contamination. Interestingly, data revealed the willingness of orthopaedic surgeons to take care of COVID-19 positive patients and support their colleagues in intensive care units, if needed. Conclusion: orthopaedic surgery departments have adapted their programs to face the unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Declines in energy expenditure resulting from canceled physical education classes and reduced physical activity may elevate childhood obesity risk. This study estimated the impact of COVID-19 on childhood obesity. METHODS: A microsimulation model simulated the trajectory of a nationally representative kindergarten cohort's body mass index z-scores and childhood obesity prevalence from April 2020 to March 2021 under the control scenario without COVID-19 and under the 4 alternative scenarios with COVID-19-Scenario 1: 2-month nationwide school closure in April and May 2020; Scenario 2: Scenario 1 followed by a 10% reduction in daily physical activity in the summer from June to August; Scenario 3: Scenario 2 followed by 2-month school closure in September and October; and Scenario 4: Scenario 3 followed by an additional 2-month school closure in November and December. RESULTS: Relative to the control scenario without COVID-19, Scenarios 1, 2, 3, and 4 were associated with an increase in the mean body mass index z-scores by 0.056 (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.055-0.056), 0.084 (95%CI: 0.084-0.085), 0.141 (95%CI: 0.140-0.142), and 0.198 (95%CI: 0.197-0.199), respectively, and an increase in childhood obesity prevalence by 0.640 (95%CI: 0.515-0.765), 0.972 (95%CI: 0.819-1.126), 1.676 (95%CI: 1.475-1.877), and 2.373 (95%CI: 2.135-2.612) percentage points, respectively. Compared to girls and non-Hispanic whites and Asians, the impact of COVID-19 on childhood obesity was modestly larger among boys and non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, respectively. CONCLUSION: Public health interventions are urgently called to promote an active lifestyle and engagement in physical activity among children to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19 on unhealthy weight gains and childhood obesity.","An, Ruopeng",J Sport Health Sci,669,20

A homeopatia surge como importante alternativa, sendo aceita nacional e internacionalmente. O objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar o tratamento homeopático com Phytolacca decandra 30CH durante a lactação de vacas com mastite subclínica, utilizando parâmetros de qualidade do leite como Califórnia Mastitis Test (CMT), contagem de células somáticas (CCS) totais, porcentagens de polimorfonucleares (PMN) e de mononucleares (MN), teores de proteína, lactose, gordura, sólidos totais (ST) e extrato seco desengordurado (ESD), além da mensuração da produção leiteira. Foram selecionadas 26 vacas, CMT 2+ e 3+ sem sinais de mastite clínica, entre o terceiro e sexto mês de lactação, pluríparas e divididas em dois grupos, um com tratamentos medicamentosos mensais e outro com tratamentos quinzenais. Mensalmente foram colhidas duas amostras de leite de cada glândula mamária (teto) que apresentava mastite subclínica. Uma das amostras foi utilizada para CCS e análise dos componentes do leite, e a outra para identificação microbiológica. Nos grupos tratados, foi administrado o medicamento homeopático Phytolaca decandra 30CH diluído em água e aspergido nas mucosas oro-nasais e vaginais, enquanto que nos grupos denominados controle foi administrado placebo da mesma maneira. A pesagem da produção láctea de ambos os grupos foi realizada quinzenalmente até o final do experimento. Verificou-se então que não houve diferença significativa entre a produção láctea, CCS e a presença de microrganismos na secreção láctea das glândulas quando comparadas antes e depois do tratamento homeopático, dentro de cada grupo, bem como quando comparados os grupos entre si.

DESIGN: REDcap online-based survey of hospital capacity. SETTING: UK secondary and tertiary hospitals providing head and neck cancer surgery. PARTICIPANTS: One representative per hospital was asked to report the capacity for head and neck cancer surgery in that institution. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The principal measures of interests were new patient referrals, capacity in outpatients, theatres and critical care; therapeutic compromises constituting delay to surgery, de-escalated surgery and therapeutic migration to non-surgical primary modality. RESULTS: Data were returned from approximately 95% of UK hospitals with a head and neck cancer surgery specialist service. 50% of UK head and neck cancer patients requiring surgery have significantly compromised treatments during the second wave: 28% delayed, 10% have received radiotherapy-based treatment instead of surgery, and 12% have received de-escalated surgery. Surgical capacity has been more severely constrained in the second wave (58% of pre-pandemic level) compared with the first wave (62%) despite the time to prepare. CONCLUSIONS: Some hospitals are overwhelmed by COVID-19 and unable to offer essential cancer surgery, but all have neighbouring hospitals in their region retaining good (or even normal) capacity. It is noteworthy that very few patients have been appropriately redirected away from the hospitals most constrained by their burden of COVID-19. The paucity of an effective central or regional strategic response to this evident mismatch between demand and surgical capacity is to the detriment of our head and neck cancer patients.","Shaw, Richard",Clin Otolaryngol,669,24

This is expensive in terms of lost jobs, lost economic productivity, and lost freedoms. So it is of interest to ask: What is the optimal intensity with which to lockdown, and how should that intensity vary dynamically over the course of an epidemic? This paper explores such questions with an optimal control model that recognizes the particular risks when infection rates surge beyond the healthcare system's capacity to deliver appropriate care. The analysis shows that four broad strategies emerge, ranging from brief lockdowns that only ""smooth the curve"" to sustained lockdowns that prevent infections from spiking beyond the healthcare system's capacity. Within this model, it can be optimal to have two separate periods of locking down, so returning to a lockdown after initial restrictions have been lifted is not necessarily a sign of failure. Relatively small changes in judgments about how to balance health and economic harms can alter dramatically which strategy prevails. Indeed, there are constellations of parameters for which two or even three of these distinct strategies can all perform equally well for the same set of initial conditions; these correspond to so-called triple Skiba points. The performance of trajectories can be highly nonlinear in the state variables, such that for various times t , the optimal unemployment rate could be low, medium, or high, but not anywhere in between. These complex dynamics emerge naturally from modeling the COVID-19 epidemic and suggest a degree of humility in policy debates. Even people who share a common understanding of the problem's economics and epidemiology can prefer dramatically different policies. Conversely, favoring very different policies is not evidence that there are fundamental disagreements.","Caulkins, Jonathan P; Grass, Dieter; Feichtinger, Gustav; Hartl, Richard F; Kort, Peter M; Prskawetz, Alexia; Seidl, Andrea; Wrzaczek, Stefan",J Math Econ,669,1

The findings of the study suggest that there exists a strong cross-sectional dependence between Covid-19 cases, deaths, and all the meteorological factors for the countries under study. The findings also reveal that a long-term relationship exists between all the meteorological factors. There exists a bi-directional causality running between the Covid-19 cases and all the meteorological factors. With Covid-19 death cases as the dependent variable, there exists bi-directional causality running between the Covid-19 death cases and Covid-19 confirmed cases, air pressure, humidity, and temperature. Temperature and air pressure exhibit a statistically significant and negative impact on the Covid-19 confirmed cases. Air pollutant PM2.5 also exhibits a significant but positive impact on the Covid-19 confirmed cases. Temperature indicates a statistically significant and negative impact on the Covid-19 death cases. At the same time, Covid-19 confirmed cases and air pollutant PM2.5 exhibit a statistically significant and positive impact on the Covid-19 death cases across the ten countries under study. Hence, it is possible to postulate that cool and dry weather conditions with lower temperatures may promote indoor activities and human gatherings (assembling), leading to virus transmission.

Methods: This study involved a cross-sectional, nonrepresentative, online survey in the United States of individuals tested for COVID-19. Testing survey items measured the performance of conventional contact tracing programs, quantified the stigma related to the notification of COVID-19 close contacts, and assessed the acceptability of a website service for digital contact tracing. Results: A sample of 668 (19.9%) individuals met the inclusion criteria and consented to participation. Among the 95 participants with COVID-19, results were received after a median of 2 days, 63.2% interacted with a contact tracing program a median of 2 days after receiving test results, 62.1% had close contacts, and 37.1% of participants with COVID-19 and close contacts did not disclose their results to all close contacts. Among all participants, 17% had downloaded a mobile application and 40.3% reported interest in a website service. One hundred and nine participants perceived stigma with the disclosure of COVID-19 test results; of these, 58.7% reported that a website service for close contact notification would decrease this stigma. Discussion: Conventional contact tracing programs did not comprehensively contact individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 nor did so within a meaningful time frame. Digital contact tracing innovations may address these shortcomings; however, the low penetration of mobile application services in the United States indicates that a suite of digital contact tracing tools, including website services, are warranted for a more exhaustive coverage of the population. Conclusions: Public health officials should develop a complementary toolkit of digital contact tracing strategies to enable effective pandemic containment strategies.","Trevino, Jesus; Keswani, Meghana; Pourmand, Ali",Telemed. j. e. health,669,16

HIV persists in cellular and anatomical reservoirs that show minimal decay during ART. A large number of studies conducted during the past 20 years have shown that HIV persists in a small pool of cells harboring integrated and replication-competent viral genomes. The majority of these cells do not produce viral particles and constitute what is referred to as the latent reservoir of HIV infection. Therefore, although HIV is not considered as a typical latent virus, it can establish a state of nonproductive infection under rare circumstances, particularly in memory CD4+ T cells, which represent the main barrier to HIV eradication. While it was originally thought that the pool of latently infected cells was largely composed of cells harboring transcriptionally silent genomes, recent evidence indicates that several blocks contribute to the nonproductive state of these cells. Here, we describe the virological and immunological factors that play a role in the establishment and persistence of the pool of latently infected cells and review the current approaches aimed at eliminating the latent HIV reservoir.","Dufour, Caroline; Gantner, Pierre; Fromentin, Rémi; Chomont, Nicolas",J Clin Invest,669,1

Of all the initial symptoms (including fever, cough, abdominal pain, anorexia, chest tightness, diarrhea, dyspnea, expectoration, fatigue, headache, hemoptysis, myalgia, nausea or vomiting, and pharyngalgia) we studied, we found that cough (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-1.7; p < 0.001), fever (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.9; p < 0.001), dyspnea (OR = 6.2, 95% CI: 3.6-10.6; p < 0.001), diarrhea (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.3-4.9; p < 0.001), fatigue (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.3-3.3; p < 0.01), expectoration (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2-2.6; p < 0.01), myalgia (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 0.8-3.1; p < 0.001), hemoptysis (OR = 4.0, 95% CI: 1.5-11.3; p < 0.001), abdominal pain (OR = 7.5, 95% CI: 2.4-23.4; p < 0.001), and anorexia (OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.5-5.1; p < 0.001) had a different distribution in two groups and were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion:COVID-19 patients whose initial manifestation is dyspnea, hemoptysis, anorexia, diarrhea, or fatigue, especially abdominal pain should be closely monitored to prevent disease deterioration.","He, Xiaobo; Cheng, Xiao; Feng, Xudong; Wan, Hong; Chen, Sihan; Xiong, Maoming",Front Public Health,669,16

We reviewed our patient data-base to determine if similar or other novel trends were present. RESULTS: Our Thrombectomy Stroke Center experienced marked declines in ED visits from 2,349 in early March to 1,178 in late April, stroke alerts dropped from 34 to 14 during the same period. Average monthly stroke admissions dropped from 34 in 2019 to 23 in 2020. Nonetheless, in March, we had 12 patients eligible for tPA, which is twice the typical caseload and was unexpected given the low overall stroke presentations. Although the neurointervention caseload was low, the patients were significantly younger. Of the acute intervention patients in March, 5 of the 12 patients were &#8804; 60 years old, and two were in their 30's. These trends are similar to those reported elsewhere but were highly unusual for our center as our catchment area is predominantly Caucasian with 34 % of the population > 65 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Even in low risk centers Covid-19 will likely impart unique stroke presentations. It will be imperative to determine the mechanisms responsible for these changes so we can institute effective strategies for optimal stroke prevention as well as maintain timely acute interventions.","Strasser, Sheryl; Miskolczi, Laszlo; Cunha, John; Justynski, Lori",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,669,16

In an attempt to control its spread and reduce its health impacts, several countries including those in the African continent imposed restrictive measures that was termed “lockdown”. The outcomes of this lockdown have been reported to be beneficial to air quality worldwide. The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of lockdown due to COVID-19 on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels over six major cities in Nigeria. Maps extracted from satellite (Sentinel-5P) were used to indicate the significant reduction in the level of NO2 in the selected cities in Nigeria during two time-intervals, pre-lockdown (December, 2019) and during lockdown (April, 2020). The results show a significant reduction in NO2 levels during the lockdown period compared with its levels during the pre-lockdown period in 2019. The reduction in NO2 concentration levels during lockdown is likely due to less traffic, social distancing and restrictions on business and human activities. There could be an element of uncertainty in the results due to seasonality, as the comparison is done with a different season. However, the magnitude of change due to lockdown is probably much higher than the seasonal variability. Although COVID-19 has negatively impacted the health and economic status of all regions worldwide, it has benefited some aspects of air quality in most countries including Nigeria. This indicates that anthropogenic activities may be managed to reduce air pollution and positively impact the health of human beings.","Johnson, Adedeji Olusola Adebola Adekunle Shote Isaifan Rima J.; Ouigmane, Abdellah",PeerJ,669,10

Around the world, researchers are continuously trying to identify small molecule inhibitors or vaccine candidates by targeting different drug targets. The SARs-CoV-2 macrodomain-I, which helps in viral replication and hijacking the host immune system, is also a potential drug target. Hence, this study targeted viral macrodomain-I by using drug similarity, virtual screening, docking and re-docking approaches. A total of 64,043 compounds were screened, and potential hits were identified based on the docking score and interactions with the key residues. The top six hits were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation and Free energy calculations and repeated three times each. The per-residue energy decomposition analysis reported that these compounds significantly interact with Asp22, Ala38, Asn40, Val44, Phe144, Gly46, Gly47, Leu127, Ser128, Gly130, Ile131, Phe132 and Ala155 which are the critical active site residues. Here, we also used ADPr as a positive control to compare our results. Our results suggest that our identified hits by using such a complicated computational pipeline could inhibit the SARs-CoV-2 by targeting the macrodomain-1. We strongly recommend the experimental testing of these compounds, which could rescue the host immune system and could help to contain the disease caused by SARs-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

This disease quickly evolved into a public health concern and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19's high transmission rate and potential to cause a spectrum of systemic diseases makes it imperative for researchers and clinicians worldwide to collaborate and develop a strategy to manage and contain this disease. Studies have shown a wide range of hematological abnormalities and virus-related coagulopathies in affected patients, resulting in an increased propensity to develop serious thrombotic complications or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in severe cases. The fatal implications of coagulopathy in the form of pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction (MI), and cerebral infarction compelled us to study in-depth the pathophysiology and treatment options related to COVID-19. This analysis reviews published reports on patients with confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection and associated coagulopathy, defined as abnormalities in the coagulation parameters prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), antithrombin time, fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products, and D-dimer. In this review, we present the hematological manifestations of COVID-19, focusing on virus-associated coagulopathy and relevant pathophysiology, clinical outcomes, and treatment.","Khandait, Harshwardhan; Gandotra, Garima; Sachdeva, Sonali; Kramer, Courtney A; Nye, Derek; Golamari, Reshma; Jain, Rohit",SN Compr Clin Med,669,26

Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters has been proposed as a complementary approach for tracing the dynamics of virus transmission within human population connected to wastewater network. The understanding on SARS-CoV-2 transmission through wastewater surveillance, the development of epidemic modeling and the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from contaminated wastewater are largely limited by our knowledge on viral RNA genome persistence and virus infectivity preservation in such an environment. Using an integrity based RT-qPCR assay this study led to the discovery that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can persist under several forms in wastewaters, which provides important information on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewaters and associated risk assessment.","Wurtzer, S; Waldman, P; Ferrier-Rembert, A; Frenois-Veyrat, G; Mouchel, J M; Boni, M; Maday, Y; Marechal, V; Moulin, L",Water Res,669,16

Such outcomes include low mood, suicide, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Studies have mostly looked at the mental health of general citizens, healthcare workers, or infected survivors, with limited research targeting university students. This study aimed to understand the psychological distress experienced by self-quarantined undergraduate university students in Lebanon during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Undergraduate students enrolled at the American University of Beirut were invited to participate in a 47-item online questionnaire. 73 participants completed the questionnaire. Demographic data, data about COVID-19 exposure, stressors during quarantine, understanding the rationale, compliance, and difficulties associated with quarantine, and levels of psychological distress were analysed. RESULTS: 75.3% of the participants were considered as having a high risk of developing acute stress. Undergoing quarantine for more than 14 days, having a chronic medical illness, inadequate access to supplies, and fear of infection were all significantly associated with an increased risk of acute stress. CONCLUSION: Despite being a necessary preventive measure during infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine can be associated with negative psychological effects, particularly in undergraduate students. Providing preventive and effective interventions is of utmost necessity.KEY POINTSDuring COVID-19, three-quarter of students had high risk for acute stress.Females had higher odds of high-risk acute stress compared to males.Having a chronic medical condition was associated with high risk acute stress.Long quarantine and lack of supplies were associated with high risk acute stress.Providing interventions to protect the mental health of students is necessary.","Kassir, Ghida; El Hayek, Samer; Zalzale, Hussein; Orsolini, Laura; Bizri, Maya",Int J Psychiatry Clin Pract,669,1

The starting hypothesis is that the contagion in urban spaces manifests unevenly in the form of clusters of cases that are generated and developed by neighborhood contagion. Methodologically, the spatial distribution of those infected in the study area, the city of Málaga (Spain), is firstly analyzed from the disaggregated and anonymous address information. After defining the concept of neighborhood contagion focus and justifying its morphological parameters, a method to detect and map neighborhood contagion focus in urban settings is proposed and applied to the study case. As the main results, the existence of focuses and micro-focuses in the spatial pattern of contagion is verified. Focuses are considered as an ideal spatial analysis unit, and the advantages and potentialities of the use of mapping focus as a useful tool for health and territorial management in different phases of the epidemic are shown.","Perles, María-Jesús; Sortino, Juan F; Mérida, Matías F",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),669,6

Fortification of food staples with vitamin D provides a solution to alleviate this problem. This research explored the use of pea protein nanoemulsion (PPN) to improve the stability of vitamin D in various food products. PPN was created using a pH-shifting and ultrasonication combined method. The physicochemical properties were studied, including particle size, foaming ability, water holding capacity, antioxidant activity, and total phenolic contents. The fortification of several food formulations (non-fat cow milk, canned orange juice, orange juice powder, banana milk, and infant formula) with vitamin D-PPN was investigated and compared to raw untreated pea protein (UPP) regarding their color, viscosity, moisture content, chemical composition, vitamin D stability, antioxidant activity, and morphology. Finally, a sensory evaluation (quantitative descriptive analysis, and consumer testing) was conducted. The results show that PPN with a size of 21.8 nm protected the vitamin D in all tested products. PPN may serve as a potential carrier and stabilizer of vitamin D in food products with minimum effects on the taste and color. Hence, PPN may serve as a green and safe method for food fortification during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Akkam, Yazan; Rababah, Taha; Costa, Rui; Almajwal, Ali; Feng, Hao; Laborde, Juan E Andrade; Abulmeaty, Mahmoud M; Razak, Suhail",,669,17

A transmission dynamics model fitted to the cumulative case time series data permits us to estimate the effectiveness of interventions implemented in terms of the contact rate, probability of transmission per contact, proportion of isolated contacts, and detection rate. This allows us to calculate the control reproduction number during different phases (which gradually decreased to less than one). From this, we derive the necessary conditions in terms of enhanced social distancing, personal protection, contact tracing, quarantine/isolation strength at each escalation phase for the disease control to avoid a rebound. From this, we quantify the conditions needed to prevent epidemic rebound during de-escalation by simply reversing the escalation process.","Tang, Biao; Scarabel, Francesca; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; McCarthy, Zachary; Glazer, Michael; Xiao, Yanyu; Heffernan, Jane M.; Asgary, Ali; Ogden, Nicholas Hume; Wu, Jianhong",Biology,669,21

The local wind erosion and dust deposition model can be useful for more accurate local wind friction, wind friction threshold, horizontal sand flux and vertical dust flux modeling on Mars. Such a model based on the model of Zender \cite{Zender} is proposed in this article. It includes different methods of threshold wind friction estimation and takes into account the influence of atmospheric electric fields on sand and dust elevation processes. The model parameterized for the Earth was tested on data acquired in Morocco field campaign 2013-2014 (Esposito et al.,) \cite{Esposito}, \cite{Esposito2}. Wind friction, wind friction threshold, horizontal sand flux and vertical dust flux were simulated by using the following inputs measured in the field: wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, air pressure, air humidity, solar irradiation and surface roughness length. The same inputs are supposed to be measured by DREAMs equipment on Mars (except for the surface roughness length which can be estimated for Mars according the method of Hebrard \cite{Hebrard}). Simulated and experimental values have shown a good agreement. The model was adapted to Martian conditions and applied to the data of Viking lander. The local wind erosion and dust deposition model parameterized for Mars may serve 1) to analyze local lander/rovers data, 2) a source of local parameters/inputs (like threshold wind friction velocity, sand and dust fluxes) for the MGCM (Mars Global Circulation Model).","N.Deniskina,",,669,16

Although migraine as such seems an ideal option for telemedicine, a systematic study reviewing feasibility, efficacy, and advantages of current advanced telecommunication technologies in children with migraine is lacking. METHODS: Clinical details of telephonic consultations performed between March 25 and June 4, 2020, including migraine characteristics, analgesic/prophylactic drug regimens, headache frequency/severity/disability, compliance, drug-related/unrelated adverse effects and unavailability of drugs were recorded. Suitable change in the dose/commercial brand of drug regimen and the addition of new drugs were done as required. Voice call, text messages, picture/video messages, and all other possible measures were used to accumulate maximum clinical information in real time. Unless contacted for trivial reasons, most children were later followed up telephonically to ensure health care concern was resolved and to fill up one 6-item trichotomous quality control questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 146 telephone consultations were performed in 51 participants. Thirty-six patients were identified to have 42 significant clinical events (worsening clinical status/partial response to medications [18; 44%], drug-related adverse effects [10; 19%], unrelated systemic complaints [7; 13%], and worsening of headache due to stress/triggers [7; 13%]). In the rest of the patients, the query of the caregiver included concern regarding COVID-19-related symptoms. Twenty-nine children required increment in drug dose or addition of new drug or commercial brand. Around 90% of caregivers were satisfied with the quality of teleconsultation. CONCLUSION: Teleconsultation is a feasible and efficacious option, with excellent caregiver satisfaction for children with migraine.","Sharawat, Indar Kumar; Panda, Prateek Kumar",J Child Neurol,669,26

This study aims to assess the effect of a clinical decision support tool for cancer survivors on cardiovascular health (CVH) discussions, referrals, completed visits with primary care providers and cardiologists, and control of modifiable CVH factors and behaviors. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruption to clinical trial accrual and operations. Studies conducted with potentially vulnerable populations, including cancer survivors, must shift towards virtual consent, data collection, and study visits to reduce risk for participants and study staff. Studies examining cancer care delivery innovations may also need to accommodate the increased use of virtual visits. Methods/design: This group-randomized, mixed methods study will recruit 600 cancer survivors from 12 National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) practices. Survivors at intervention sites will use the AH-HA tool with their oncology provider;survivors at usual care sites will complete routine survivorship visits. Outcomes will be measured immediately after the study visit, with follow-up at 6 and 12 months. The study was amended during the COVID-19 pandemic to allow for virtual consent, data collection, and intervention options, with the goal of minimizing participant-staff in-person contact and accommodating virtual survivorship visits.

By 9th April 2020 Spain was the second country in confirmed cases and in deaths. On March 14, 2020, the Spanish Government declared the state of alarm to limit viral transmission. During such state, citizens must stay confined at home with few justified exceptions. This whole situation drastically changed the life of the population, which can cause a wide range of psychosocial impacts. This study explored the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general adult population (N = 3055) during the first stages of the outbreak in Spain, as well as their anxiety, stress and depression levels. We also examined the extent to which the following variables were associated to participants’ mental health: (1) demographics; (2) degree of concern about the pandemic; (3) environmental conditions during the home confinement, (4) changes in daily life as a consequence of the pandemic; (5) contact with the COVID-19 disease; (6) actual and perceived severity of the crisis; (7) information about the COVID-19, (8) perceived health status and (9) leisure activities conducted within the last 24 h.

While previous studies have demonstrated high predictive power of incorporating air travel data and governmental policy responses in global disease transmission modelling, factors influencing the decision to implement travel and border restriction policies have attracted relatively less attention. This paper examines the role of globalization on the pace of adoption of international travel-related non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the coronavirus pandemic. This study aims to offer advice on how to improve the global planning, preparation, and coordination of actions and policy responses during future infectious disease outbreaks with empirical evidence. METHODS AND DATA: We analyzed data on international travel restrictions in response to COVID-19 of 185 countries from January to October 2020. We applied time-to-event analysis to examine the relationship between globalization and the timing of travel restrictions implementation. RESULTS: The results of our survival analysis suggest that, in general, more globalized countries, accounting for the country-specific timing of the virus outbreak and other factors, are more likely to adopt international travel restrictions policies. However, countries with high government effectiveness and globalization were more cautious in implementing travel restrictions, particularly if through formal political and trade policy integration. This finding is supported by a placebo analysis of domestic NPIs, where such a relationship is absent. Additionally, we find that globalized countries with high state capacity are more likely to have higher numbers of confirmed cases by the time a first restriction policy measure was taken. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the dynamic relationship between globalization and protectionism when governments respond to significant global events such as a public health crisis. We suggest that the observed caution of policy implementation by countries with high government efficiency and globalization is a by-product of commitment to existing trade agreements, a greater desire to 'learn from others' and also perhaps of 'confidence' in a government's ability to deal with a pandemic through its health system and state capacity. Our results suggest further research is warranted to explore whether global infectious disease forecasting could be improved by including the globalization index and in particular, the de jure economic and political, and de facto social dimensions of globalization, while accounting for the mediating role of government effectiveness. By acting as proxies for a countries' likelihood and speed of implementation for international travel restriction policies, such measures may predict the likely time delays in disease emergence and transmission across national borders.","Bickley, Steve J; Chan, Ho Fai; Skali, Ahmed; Stadelmann, David; Torgler, Benno",Global Health,669,20

Previous studies revealed pregnant women with COVID-19 had similar clinical manifestations to nonpregnant women. However, little is known about the outcome of neonates born to infected women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this retrospective study, we studied 29 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection delivered in 2 designated general hospitals in Wuhan, China between January 30 and March 10, 2020, and 30 neonates (1 set of twins). Maternal demographic characteristics, delivery course, symptoms, and laboratory tests from hospital records were extracted. Neonates were hospitalized if they had symptoms (5 cases) or their guardians agreed to a hospitalized quarantine (13 cases), whereas symptom-free neonates also could be discharged after birth and followed up through telephone (12 cases). For hospitalized neonates, laboratory test results and chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) were extracted from hospital records. The presence of antibody of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in the serum of 4 neonates. Among 29 pregnant COVID-19-infected women (13 confirmed and 16 clinical diagnosed), the majority had higher education (56.6%), half were employed (51.7%), and their mean age was 29 years. Fourteen women experienced mild symptoms including fever (8), cough (9), shortness of breath (3), diarrhea (2), vomiting (1), and 15 were symptom-free. Eleven of 29 women had pregnancy complications, and 27 elected to have a cesarean section delivery. Of 30 neonates, 18 were admitted to Wuhan Children's Hospital for quarantine and care, whereas the other 12 neonates discharged after birth without any symptoms and had normal follow-up. Five hospitalized neonates were diagnosed as COVID-19 infection (2 confirmed and 3 suspected). In addition, 12 of 13 other hospitalized neonates presented with radiological features for pneumonia through X-ray or CT screening, 1 with occasional cough and the others without associated symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 specific serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were measured in 4 neonates and 2 were positive. The limited sample size limited statistical comparison between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed COVID-19 or radiological features of pneumonia in some, but not all, neonates born to women with COVID-19 infection. These findings suggest that intrauterine or intrapartum transmission is possible and warrants clinical caution and further investigation.

Selenium (Se) is known for its antioxidant property and can resist several stressors affecting farm animals. The aims of this study were (â ) to determine how excess NH3 exert nephrotoxic effects in pigs and (â ¡) to investigate whether selenomethionine has an alleviative effect on NH3 toxicity. Two diets supplemented with different doses of Se (0.22 mg/kg or 0.50 mg/kg) and two concentrations of NH3 (< 5 mg/m3 or 89.8 mg/m3) were used in a 2 × 2 factorial design trial for a period of 30 days. The results showed that NH3 exposure caused apoptosis and increased the number of apoptotic cells in pig kidneys. Further, the activities of antioxidant enzymes were decreased, and the transcriptional and translational levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes, Bcl-2 and Caspase family members were increased under NH3 exposure. In addition, Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway was suppressed after NH3 treatment. Dietary supplement with selenomethionine appears to offer protection against NH3-induced kidney injury in pigs and the pathologic changes above were alleviated.

Viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured in swine testicle cells. FINDINGS: UV irradiation, vaporized H2O2 and dry heat reduced infectious PRCV by more than three orders of magnitude on mask and respirator coupons and rendered it undetectable in all decontamination assays. CONCLUSION: This is the first description of stable disinfection of face masks and filtering facepiece respirators contaminated with an infectious SARS-CoV-2 surrogate using UV irradiation, vaporized H2O2 and dry heat treatment. The three methods permit demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude of an infectious coronavirus in line with the United States Food and Drug Administration policy regarding face masks and respirators. It presents advantages of uncomplicated manipulation and utilization in a BSL2 facility, therefore being easily adaptable to other respirator and mask types.","Ludwig-Begall, L F; Wielick, C; Dams, L; Nauwynck, H; Demeuldre, P-F; Napp, A; Laperre, J; Haubruge, E; Thiry, E",J Hosp Infect,669,10

DESIGN: Cross-sectional on-line survey conducted between 24 April and 22 July 2020. SETTING: Twenty-one European countries. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 31 964 adults reporting past-year drinking. MEASUREMENTS: Changes in alcohol consumption were measured by asking respondents about changes over the previous month in their drinking frequency, the quantity they consumed and incidence of heavy episodic drinking events. Individual indicators were combined into an aggregated consumption-change score and scaled to a possible range of -1 to +1. Using this score as the outcome, multi-level linear regressions tested changes in overall drinking, taking into account sampling weights and baseline alcohol consumption [Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT-C)] and country of residence serving as random intercept. Similar models were conducted for each single consumption-change indicator. FINDINGS: The aggregated consumption-change score indicated an average decrease in alcohol consumption of -0.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.18, -0.10]. Statistically significant decreases in consumption were found in all countries, except Ireland (-0.08, 95% CI = -0.17, 0.01) and the United Kingdom (+0.10, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.17). Decreases in drinking were mainly driven by a reduced frequency of heavy episodic drinking events (-0.17, 95% CI = -0.20, -0.14). Declines in consumption were less marked among those with low- or average incomes and those experiencing distress. CONCLUSIONS: On average, alcohol consumption appears to have declined during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Both reduced availability of alcohol and increased distress may have affected consumption, although the former seems to have had a greater impact in terms of immediate effects.","Kilian, Carolin; Rehm, Jürgen; Allebeck, Peter; Braddick, Fleur; Gual, Antoni; Barták, Miroslav; Bloomfield, Kim; Gil, Artyom; Neufeld, Maria; O039,; Donnell, Amy; Petruzelka, Benjamin; Rogalewicz, Vladimir; Schulte, Bernd; Manthey, Jakob",Addiction,669,15

Background: Among neurological manifestations, multiple reports reflect emerging evidence for neurotropism of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, including frequent complaints of anosmia, seizures and less common reports of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, acute necrotizing encephalitis etc2. A hypercoagulable state has also been reported in many patients, characterized by thrombocytopenia, elevated fibrinogen and d-dimer levels leading to unusual cases of multifocal pulmonary thrombosis as well as acute ischemic strokes3-6. SARS-CoV-2 virus has also been implicated in autoimmune and auto-inflammatory disease leading to a vasculopathy and/or vasculitides1 among mounting reports of spontaneous coronary artery and cerebral artery dissection in COVID-19 patients without any history of antecedent trauma or connective tissue disorder(7-11). Design/Methods: We report a prospectively followed cohort of all hospitalized cases with confirmed COVID-19 infection (SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive) and CVD (ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke) between March 26th and April 12th, 2020 treated at our comprehensive stroke center located in the New York City Metropolitan area. Diagnosis of CVD was confirmed on neuroimaging with CT, CTA and/or MRI of the brain. Baseline demographics, clinical, laboratory, diagnostic and imaging findings were extracted by a board-certified or board-eligible neurologist. Stroke etiology, according to the TOAST criteria for ischemic stroke, was determined based on available workup. Results: We admitted a total of 48 patients with acute ischemic stroke during the study period, 8 of whom had concomitant COVID-19 and were managed in the COVID Intensive care unit. Conclusions: In conclusion, based on the presumption that the infection with the COVID-19 virus results in a hyperinflammatory cascade, and consequently hypercoagulability, intensivists should have a high index of suspicion for cerebrovascular complications in the setting of this pandemic.","Alshammari, H.; Ali, S.; Galluzza, D.; Rechester, O.; Nouman, R.; Gandhi, C.; Mayer, S.; Al-Muft, F.",Neurology,669,30

The sudden expansion in the need for inpatient and intensive care facilities raised concerns about optimal clinical management and resource allocation. Despite the pressing need for evidence to make context-specific decisions on COVID-19 management, evidence from South Africa remained limited. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalised patients. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study design was used to evaluate the clinical outcomes of hospitalised adult patients (&#8805; 18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness at Mthatha Regional Hospital (MRH), Eastern Cape. RESULTS: Of the 1814 patients tested for COVID-19 between 20 March 2020 and 31 July 2020 at MRH, two-thirds (65.4%) were female. About two-thirds (242) of the 392 patients (21.6%) who tested positive for this disease were hospitalised and one-third (150) were quarantined at home. The mean age of the patients tested for COVID-19 was 42.6 years and there was no difference between males and females. The mean age of hospitalised patients was 55.5 years and the mean age of hospitalised patients who died (61.3 years) was much higher than recovered (49.5 years). Overall, 188 (77.6%) hospitalised patients had clinical comorbidity on admission. Diabetes (36.8%) and hypertension (33.1%) were the most common comorbidities amongst COVID-19 hospitalised patients. CONCLUSION: The majority of the patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19 were elderly and had high baseline comorbidities. Advance age and underlying comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension and HIV) were associated with high mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients.","Kaswa, Ramprakash; Yogeswaran, Parimalaranie; Cawe, Busisiwe",S Afr Fam Pract (2004),669,12

SARS CoV-2 primarily transmits in the air but the persistence of the virus in the water possibly can serve as a secondary source even though current studies do not show this. In this paper, an evaluation of the current literature with regards to the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and biosolids is presented. Treatment efficiencies of WWTPs are compared for viral load reduction on the basis of publicly available data. The results of this evaluation indicate that existing WWTPs are effectively removing 1–6 log10 viable SARS-CoV-2. However, sludge and biosolids provide an umbrella of protection from treatment and inactivation to the virus. Hence, sludge treatment factors like high temperature, pH changes, and predatory microorganisms can effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2.","Saba, Beenish Hasan Shadi W.; Kjellerup, Birthe V.; Christy, Ann D.",Bioresource Technology Reports,669,24

Few studies have investigated its utilityin otolaryngology, and none have assessed its application to the ESBS practice. This study aims to assess the utility oftelemedicine to increase patient access and determine patient satisfaction in this setting. Methods: This project was considered as a quality improvement initiative and was therefore exempt from institutionalreview board review. A retrospective chart review between July 1 and August 31, 2020, extracted demographic and clinicalinformation from new patient telemedicine and in-person visits in our ESBS practice (rhinology and neurosurgery). Aseparate phone survey was conducted in a subset of patients after their visits answering questions related to satisfactionscored on a 5-point Likert scale ([ Fig. 1 ]). Univariate analysis with Mann-Whitney and Fisher's exact tests were performed for continuous and categorical variables. Results: Overall, there were 137 patients who were seen in-person or via telemedicine. Mean age was 52.7 ± 16.2 years, 59(43.1%) were white, and 85 (62.0%) were female. The majority, 115, (84.0%) were seen by an otolaryngologist and 22(16.1%) by a neurosurgeon. One-hundred thirteen (82.5%), 18 (13.1%), and 6 (4.4%) patients underwent in-office, video,and telephone visits, respectively. The median distance from patient residence to the clinic was 12.3 miles (range: 0.6-184.0). The median round-trip drive time was 52 minutes (range: 6.0-420.0;[ Fig. 2 ]). Median expected round-trip drivetime did not significantly differ between telemedicine and in-person visits (58 and 52 minutes, respectively). For those whoreceived phone surveys ( N = 30), the mean age was 50.0 ± 14.7 years, 15 (50.0%) were African American, and 17 (56.7%)were female. Twenty-five (83.3%) and 5 (16.7%) patients had an otolaryngology and neurosurgery appointment,respectively. Seventeen (56.7%), 11 (36.7%), and 2 (6.7%) patients had an in-office, video, and telephone visit,respectively. Half were new and half were return visits. The majority (27/30, 90%) reported overall satisfaction with theirvisit as defined by a score of 4 or 5 on the Likert scale, and 20/30 (66.7%) believed telemedicine to be more convenientthan in person. Nevertheless, the majority (20/30, 66.7%) expressed a preference for a future visit to occur in person.Patient satisfaction was not associated with age, race, mode of visit (telemedicine vs. in person), visit specialty, or visitstatus (new vs. return;p &gt; 0.05, all). Conclusion: Patients with rhinology and skull base pathology would gain better access to care with less travel time usingtelemedicine. Although the majority were satisfied with telemedicine and its convenience, most patients still prefer in-person consultation. Telemedicine could prove useful in screening patients in the tertiary ESBS setting in the post-COVID-19 era prior to in person evaluation.","Du, M.; Adams, D.; Caballero, N.; Portugal, L.; Das, P.; Horowitz, P.; Yamini, B.; Pinto, J.; Roxbury, C.",Journal of Neurological Surgery Part B: Skull Base,669,20

In this work, we performed the first evaluation of the QIAstat-Dx respiratory SARS-CoV-2 panel (QIAstat-SARS) for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This assay is the first rapid multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay, including SARS-CoV-2 detection, and is fully compatible with a non-PCR-trained laboratory or point-of-care (PoC) testing. This evaluation was performed using 69 primary clinical samples (66 nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], 1 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample [BAL], 1 tracheal aspirate sample, and 1 bronchial aspirate sample) comparing SARS-CoV-2 detection with the currently WHO-recommended reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (WHO-RT-PCR) workflow. Additionally, a comparative limit of detection (LoD) assessment was performed for QIAstat-SARS and WHO-RT-PCR using a quantified clinical sample. Compatibility of sample pretreatment for viral neutralization or viscous samples with the QIAstat-SARS system were also tested. The QIAstat-Dx respiratory SARS-CoV-2 panel demonstrated a sensitivity comparable to that of the WHO-recommended assay with a limit of detection at 1,000 copies/ml. The overall percent agreement between QIAstat-Dx SARS and WHO-RT-PCR on 69 clinical samples was 97% with a sensitivity of 100% (40/40) and specificity at 93% (27/29). No cross-reaction was encountered for any other respiratory viruses or bacteria included in the panel.

Until recently, its treatment is mainly based on physical locations and meetings while being face to face. However, laser acupuncture tele-therapy approaches can significantly provide the patient with safety during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as changing the disorder's prognosis. Sixty patients were assigned randomly into 2 groups with 1:1 ratio. Patients in group A are treated remotely by laser acupuncture in addition to methotrexate and a tele-rehabilitation program in the form of aerobic exercise training. Patients in group B are treated by methotrexate and a tele-rehabilitation program in the form of aerobic exercise. There was a statistically significant difference in health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) pre- and post-treatment in group A (p < 0.05). The C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) inflammatory markers as well as the malondialdehyde (MDA) oxidative marker showed a significant reduction pre- and post-treatment in group A (p < 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant increase in the adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) antioxidant marker pre- and post-treatment in group A (p < 0.05).

All-causes mortality in Portugal increased during March and April 2020 compared to previous years, but this increase is not explained by COVID-19 reported deaths. The aim of this study was to analyze and consider other criteria for estimating excessive all-cause mortality during the early COVID-19 pandemic period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Public data was used to estimate excess mortality by age and region between March 1 and April 22, proposing baselines adjusted for the lockdown period. RESULTS: An excess mortality of 2400 to 4000 deaths was observed. Excess mortality was associated with older age groups (over age 65) [corrected]. DISCUSSION: The data suggests a ternary explanation for early excess mortality: COVID-19, non-identified COVID-19 and decrease in access to healthcare. The estimates have implications in terms of communication of non-pharmaceutical actions, for research, and to healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: Despite the inherent uncertainty, the excess mortality occurred between March 1 and April 22 could be 3.5- to 5-fold higher than what can be explained by the official COVID-19 deaths [corrected].","Nogueira, Paulo Jorge; Nobre, Miguel De Araújo; Nicola, Paulo Jorge; Furtado, Cristina; Vaz Carneiro, António",Acta Med Port,669,1

Therefore, investigating the effects of purple seed stain (PSS) on seed quality (germination and vigor) and seed composition (nutrition) is critical. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of PSS on seed harvest index, seed germination, seed vigor, and seed composition components (protein, oil, fatty acids, and sugars). A field experiment was initiated in 2019 in Stoneville, MS, at the Delta Research and Extension Center (DREC) on a Commerce silt loam soil (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Fluventic Epiaquepts). Soybean variety Credenz 4748 LL was used. The results showed that infected (symptomatic) seed had a 5.5% greater Seed Index (based on 100 seed weight) when compared to non-infected (non-symptomatic, as control) seed. Non-infected seed had greater percent germination and seedling vigor when compared to infected seed. Germination was 30.9% greater and vigor was 58.3% greater in non-infected seed. Also, the results showed that infected seed with PSS had higher protein content and some amino acids. No changes in total oil and fatty acids. Sucrose and stachyose were lower in infected seed than in non-infected seed. The research showed that PSS impacted seed health and seed quality (germination and vigor) and seed composition (protein, sugars, and some amino acids). Purple stained seed should be avoided when planting and should be managed properly as low germination is a potential risk. Planting population should be adjusted accordingly due to lack of germination and vigor if PSS is present. This research help growers for purple seed management, and scientists to further understand the potential negative impact on seed quality and nutrition. Further research is needed before conclusive recommendations are made.","Turner, Richard E; Ebelhar, M Wayne; Wilkerson, Teresa; Bellaloui, Nacer; Golden, Bobby R; Irby, J Trenton; Martin, Steve",,669,16

Amplification of viral RNA by (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the current gold standard test for confirmation of infection, although it presents known shortcomings: long turnaround times (3-4 hours to generate results), potential shortage of reagents, false-negative rates as large as 15-20%, the need for certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained personnel. Thus there is a need for alternative, faster, less expensive and more accessible tests. We developed two machine learning classification models using hematochemical values from routine blood exams (namely: white blood cells counts, and the platelets, CRP, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, LDH plasma levels) drawn from 279 patients who, after being admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) emergency-room with COVID-19 symptoms, were screened with the rRT-PCR test performed on respiratory tract specimens. Of these patients, 177 resulted positive, whereas 102 received a negative response. We have developed two machine learning models, to discriminate between patients who are either positive or negative to the SARS-CoV-2: their accuracy ranges between 82% and 86%, and sensitivity between 92% e 95%, so comparably well with respect to the gold standard. We also developed an interpretable Decision Tree model as a simple decision aid for clinician interpreting blood tests (even off-line) for COVID-19 suspect cases. This study demonstrated the feasibility and clinical soundness of using blood tests analysis and machine learning as an alternative to rRT-PCR for identifying COVID-19 positive patients. This is especially useful in those countries, like developing ones, suffering from shortages of rRT-PCR reagents and specialized laboratories.

It is emphasized that if the term from the recent anticancer treatment to the diagnosis of COVID-19 was short, the probability of serious events increased in cancer patients. Therefore, early detection of COVID-19 and prevention of serious events is very important. We aimed to investigate whether it is possible to detect COVID-19 early by positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the images and clinical findings of patients who underwent PET/CT due to malignancy and whose COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test were detected positive subsequently. Results: Eight cancer patients with positive COVID-19 PCR tests were included in the study. PET/CT revealed subpleural ground-glass opacities (GGOs) showing mild fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake that could be compatible with COVID-19 in 4 of 8 patients. The number of affected lobes ranged from 1-4. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR test when symptoms and/or lung findings worsened on the days after PET/CT. The time interval between the last anticancer treatment and COVID-19 diagnosis in five patients was &#8804;7 days. During the follow-up, six of the cases (75%) needed mechanical ventilation and died later. Conclusion: COVID-19 may be recognised early by detecting incidental findings in PET/CT, especially in asymptomatic cancer patients. Potential complications may be prevented by early diagnosis and anticancer therapy changes. Therefore, possible COVID-19 findings in PET/CT should be reported and the patient should be referred to relevant clinician.","Tekin, Duygu; Budak, Emine; Yoldas, Banu; Budak, Adnan",Indian J Cancer,669,26

One of the most important methods for COVID-19 detection is the use of techniques such as real time RT-PCR based on a previous extraction/purification of RNA procedure from nasopharyngeal cells using functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNP). This technique allows the processing of ~ 10,000 tests per day in private companies and around hundreds per day at local Universities guaranteeing to reach a wide range of the population. However, the main drawback of this method is the need for specialized MNP with a strong negative charge for the viral RNA extraction to detect the existence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here we present a simplified low cost method to produce 10 g of nanoparticles in 100 mL of solution that was scaled to one litter by parallelizing the process 10 times in just two days and allowing for the possibility of making ~ 50,000 COVID-19 tests. This communication helps in reducing the cost of acquiring MNP for diverse biomolecular applications supporting developing country budgets constraints and chemical availability specially during the COVID-19 International Health Emergency.","Chacón-Torres, Julio C; Reinoso, C; Navas-León, Daniela G; Briceño, Sarah; González, Gema",Sci Rep,669,1

To inform future disease prevention and control, we analyzed global data to exam the relationship between state vulnerabilities and COVID-19 incidences and deaths. Methods: : Vulnerability was measured using the Fragile States Index (FSI). FSI is created by the Fund for Peace to assess levels of fragility for individual countries. Total FSI score and scores for 12 specific indicators were used as the predictor variables. Outcome variables were national cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths up to September 16, 2020, derived the World Health Organization. Cumulative incidence rates were computed using 2019 National population derived from the World Bank, and case fatality rates were computed as the ratio of deaths/COVID-19 cases. Countries with incomplete data were excluded, yielding a final sample of 146 countries. Multivariate regression was used to examine the association between the predictor and the outcome measures. Results: : There were dramatic cross-country variations in both FSI and COVID-19 epidemiological measurements. FSI total scores were negatively associated with both COVID-19 cumulative incidence rates (ßâ¯=â¯-0.0135, P < 0.001) and case fatality rates (ßâ¯=â¯-0.0147, P < 0.05). Of the 12 FSI indicators, three negatively associated with COVID-19 incidences were E1(Economic Decline and Poverty), E3 (Human Flight and Brain Drain), and S2 (Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons); two positively associated were P1 (State Legitimacy) and X1 (External Intervention). With regard to association with case fatality rates, C1 (Security Apparatus) was positive, and P3 (Human Rights and Rule of Law) and X1 was negative. Conclusions: : With FSI measures by the Fund of Peace, overall, more fragile countries are less likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and even if affected, death rates were lower. However, poor in state legitimacy and lack of external intervention are risk for COVID-19 infection and lack of security apparatus is risky for COVID-19 death. Implications of the study findings are discussed and additional studies are needed to examine the mechanisms underpinning these relationships.","Duan, Yuqi; Ma, Junxiong; Huang, Yangmu; Chen, Xinguang; Zheng, Zhi-Jie",,669,20

Despite a significant mortality rate, the severity of most cases of COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic, and silent infection affects a still-unknown proportion of the general population. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection among patients with cancer receiving anticancer treatment during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 1, 2020, to the end of the same month, 560 consecutive patients with cancer, asymptomatic for COVID-19 and on anticancer treatment at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including the rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G/IgM and the nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in case of seropositivity to identify SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. RESULTS: In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of different type of cancer, stage, and treatment. The Ig-seropositive patients were then tested with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs, and 38% proved to be SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. At an early follow-up, in the 97 SARS-CoV-2-seropositive/RT-PCR-negative patients who continued their anticancer therapies, only one developed symptomatic COVID-19 illness. CONCLUSION: Among patients with cancer, the two-step diagnostics is feasible and effective for SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers detection and might support optimal cancer treatment strategies at both the individual and the population level. The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in cases of RT-PCR-negative patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This is the first study evaluating the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection in actively treated patients with cancer, during the epidemic peak in one of the worst areas of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lacking national and international recommendations for the detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, a pragmatic and effective two-step diagnostics was implemented to ascertain SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. In this series, consisting of consecutive and unselected patients with cancer, the prevalence of both SARS-CoV-2-seropositive patients and silent carriers is substantial (31% and 10%, respectively). The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in case of RT-PCR-negative patients.","Zambelli, Alberto; Chiudinelli, Lorenzo; Fotia, Vittoria; Negrini, Giorgia; Bosetti, Tommaso; Callegaro, Annapaola; Di Croce, Andrea; Caremoli, Elena Rota; Moro, Cecilia; Milesi, Laura; Poletti, Paola; Tasca, Cristina; Mandalà, Mario; Merelli, Barbara; Mosconi, Stefania; Arnoldi, Ermenegildo; Bettini, Anna; Bonomi, Lucia; Messina, Caterina; Ghilardi, Laura; Chirco, Alessandra; Maracino, Michela; Tondini, Carlo",Oncologist,669,16

Low-wage and minority workers are more likely to work in hazardous industries and are thus at greater risk. Within the small business sector, in particular, the health of low-wage and minority workers is threatened by a multitude of complex and interrelated factors that increase their risk for injuries, death, and even chronic disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified these concerns, as many low-wage and minority workers are essential workers, and many small businesses are reopening with little to no guidance. The article describes work-related health risks and reviews current research on occupational and social ecological approaches to improving the health of minority and low-wage workers primarily employed by small businesses. We propose a conceptual framework that integrates the social ecological model with the hierarchy of controls to address work-related health among low-wage and minority workers specifically in the small business sector. Community-based strategies are recommended to engage small business owners and workers in efforts to address their immediate needs, while building towards sustainable policy change over time.

In this study, we aimed to reveal the association of cardiac injury with coagulation dysfunction. We enrolled 181 consecutive patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19, and studied the clinical characteristics and outcome of these patients. Cardiac biomarkers high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-cTnI), myohemoglobin and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) were assessed in all patients. The clinical outcomes were defined as hospital discharge or death. The median age of the study cohort was 55 (IQR, 46-65) years, and 102 (56.4%) were males. Forty-two of the 181 patients (23.2%) had cardiac injury. Old age, high leukocyte count, and high levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), D-dimer and serum ferritin were significantly associated with cardiac injury. Multivariate regression analysis revealed old age and elevated D-dimer levels as being strong risk predictors of in-hospital mortality. Interleukin 6 (IL6) levels were comparable in patients with or without cardiac injury. Serial observations of coagulation parameters demonstrated highly synchronous alterations of D-dimer along with progression to cardiac injury. Cardiac injury is a common complication of COVID-19 and is an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality. Old age, high leukocyte count, and high levels of AST, D-dimer and serum ferritin are significantly associated with cardiac injury, whereas IL6 are not. Therefore, the pathogenesis of cardiac injury in COVID-19 may be primarily due to coagulation dysfunction along with microvascular injury.","Chen, Liang; Hu, Wei; Guo, Xiaoxiao; Zhao, Ping; Tang, Jia; Gu, Yuwei; Huang, Ninghao; Wang, Chao; Cui, An; Zhang, Dian; Hu, Linjie; Feng, Yi; Hu, Shengshou; Chen, Mingquan; Duru, Firat; Xiong, Chenglong",Sci Rep,669,16

This study aimed to assess the effects of liver injuries on the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 1520 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 from Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, were enrolled. Chronic liver disease (CLD) was confirmed by consensus diagnostic criteria. Laboratory test results were compared between different groups. scRNA-seq data and bulk gene expression profiles were used to identify cell types associated with liver injury. RESULTS: A total of 10.98% of patients with severe or critical COVID-19 developed liver injury after admission that was associated with significantly higher rates of mortality (21.74%, p < 0.001) and intensive care unit admission (26.71%, p < 0.001). Pre-existing CLDs were not associated with a higher risk. However, fatty liver disease and cirrhosis were associated with higher risks, supported by evidences from single cell and bulk transcriptome analysis that showed more TMPRSS2+ cells in these tissues. By generating a model, we were able to predict the risk and severity of liver injury during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that liver injury occurring during therapy as well as pre-existing CLDs like fatty liver disease and cirrhosis in patients with COVID-19 is significantly associated with the severity of disease and mortality, but the presence of other CLD is not associated. We provide a risk-score model that can predict whether patients with COVID-19 will develop liver injury or proceed to higher-risk stages during subsequent hospitalizations.","Shao, Jiaofang; Liang, Yuan; Li, Yan; Ding, Rong; Zhu, Mengyan; You, Wenhua; Wang, Ziyu; Huang, Bin; Wu, Min; Zhang, Tingting; Li, Kening; Wu, Wei; Wu, Lingxiang; Wang, Qianghu; Xia, Xinyi; Wang, Shukui; Lu, Ling",Hepatol Int,669,16

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: Studies reporting associations between frailty and outcomes in the setting of COVID-19 diagnosis. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Following review of titles, abstracts and full text, we included 52 studies that contained 118,373 participants with COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic studies tool. Our primary outcome was mortality, secondary outcomes included delirium, intensive care unit admission, need for ventilation and discharge location. Where appropriate, random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool adjusted and unadjusted effect measures by frailty instrument. RESULTS: The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was the most used frailty instrument. Mortality was reported in 37 studies. After confounder adjustment, frailty identified using the CFS was significantly associated with mortality in COVID-19 positive patients (odds ratio 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49-2.14; hazard ratio 1.87, 95% CI 1.33-2.61). On an unadjusted basis, frailty identified using the CFS was significantly associated with increased odds of delirium and reduced odds of intensive care unit admission. Results were generally consistent using other frailty instruments. Patient-reported, cost and experience outcomes were rarely reported. CONCLUSION: Frailty is associated with a substantial increase in mortality risk in COVID-19 patients, even after adjustment. Delirium risk is also increased. Frailty assessment may help to guide prognosis and individualized care planning, but data relating frailty status to patient-reported outcomes are urgently needed to provide a more comprehensive overview of outcomes relevant to older adults.","Dumitrascu, Flavia; Branje, Karina E; Hladkowicz, Emily S; Lalu, Manoj; McIsaac, Daniel I",J. am. geriatr. soc,669,1

Slow wave sleep (SWS) has been implicated in maintaining prospective memories, although which SWS oscillations most benefit this memory type remains unclear. Here, we investigated SWS spectral power correlates of prospective memory. Healthy young adult participants completed three ongoing tasks in the morning or evening. They were then given the prospective memory instruction to remember to press ""Q"" when viewing the words ""horse"" or ""table"" when repeating the ongoing task after a 12-h delay including overnight, polysomnographically recorded sleep or continued daytime wakefulness. Spectral power analysis was performed on recorded sleep EEG. Two additional groups were tested in the morning or evening only, serving as time-of-day controls. Participants who slept demonstrated superior prospective memory compared with those who remained awake, an effect not attributable to time-of-day of testing. Contrary to prior work, prospective memory was negatively associated with SWS. Furthermore, significant increases in spectral power in the delta-theta frequency range (1.56 Hz-6.84 Hz) during SWS was observed in participants who failed to execute the prospective memory instructions. Although sleep benefits prospective memory maintenance, this benefit may be compromised if SWS is enriched with delta-theta activity.","Cunningham, Tony J; Bottary, Ryan; Denis, Dan; Payne, Jessica D",Learn Mem,669,20

No study has evaluated the time required to reverse this downward curve of MI admissions. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis on patients (N = 2415) admitted to the Emergency Departments for acute MI in nine Italian centers. Primary endpoint was the incidence rates (IRs) of MI admissions in the post-lockdown COVID-19 period (case-period: from May 4 to July 12, 2020) vs. the following control periods: January 1-February 19, 2020 (pre-lockdown period); February 20-May 3, 2020 (intra-lockdown period); May 4-July 12, 2019 (inter-year non-COVID-19 period). RESULTS: IR of admissions for MI in the post-lockdown period was higher than the intra-lockdown period (IR ratio, IRR: 1.60, 95% CI 1.42-1.81; p = 0.0001), was lower than the pre-lockdown period (IRR: 0.86, 0.77-0.96; p = 0.009) and similar to the inter-year non-COVID-19 period (IRR: 0.96, 0.87-1.07; p = 0.47). Within the case period, the increase in MI admissions was more pronounced in earlier vs later weeks (IRR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02-1.38, p = 0.024) and, compared to the inter-year control period, was significant for non ST-segment elevation MI (IRR: 1.25, 95% CI 1.08-1.46, p = 0.004), but was not observed for ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI), where hospitalizations were reduced (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.88, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study first indicates an increase in the number of admissions for MI after the removal of the national lockdown for COVID-19 in Italy. This increase was prevalent in the first weeks following the lockdown removal, but was under-represented in STEMI patients.","Rognoni, Andrea; D039,; Ascenzo, Fabrizio; Solli, Martina; Mennuni, Marco G; Galiffa, Vincenzo; Rosso, Roberta; Cavallino, Chiara; Ugo, Fabrizio; De Filippo, Ovidio; Borin, Andrea; Porto, Italo; Fedele, Francesco; Mancone, Massimo; Sardella, Gennaro; Trabattoni, Daniela; Barbero, Umberto; Moncalvo, Cinzia; Verardi, Roberto; Casella, Gianni; Montalto, Claudio; Leonardi, Sergio; Azzolina, Danila; De Ferrari, Gaetano Maria; Patti, Giuseppe",Int J Cardiol,669,21

The Spanish Society of Nephrology conducted a survey directed to the Heads of Nephrology Departments in Spain that addressed the reorganisation of Nephrology departments and activity during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. The survey has been focused on the integration of nephrologists in COVID-19 teams, nephrology inpatient care activities (elective admissions, kidney biopsies), the performance of elective surgeries such as vascular accesses or implantation of peritoneal catheters, the suspension of kidney transplantation programmes and the transformation of nephrology outpatient clinics. This work details the adaptation and transformation of nephrology services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. During this period, elective admissions to Nephrology Services, elective surgeries and biopsies were suspended, and the kidney transplant programme was scaled back by more than 75%. It is worth noting that outpatient nephrology consultations were carried out largely by telephone. In conclusion, the pandemic has clearly impacted clinical activity in Spanish Nephrology departments, reducing elective activity and kidney transplants, and modifying activity in outpatient clinics. A restructuring and implementation plan in Nephrology focused on telemedicine and/or virtual medicine would seem to be both necessary and very useful in the near future.","Soler, María José; Macia Heras, Manuel; Ortiz, Alberto; Del Pino Y Pino, María Dolores; Salgueira Lazo, Mercedes",Nefrologia,669,10

U-Report is a mobile empowerment platform that connects young people all over the world to information that will change their lives and influence decisions. Previous studies of U-Report's effectiveness highlight strengths in the timeliness, low cost and high credibility for collecting and sending information, however they also highlight areas to improve on concerning data representation. EquityTool has developed a simpler approach to assess the wealth quintiles of respondents based on fewer questions derived from large household surveys such as Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Methods: The methodology of Equity Tool was adopted to assess the socio-economic profile of U-Reporters (ie, enrolled participants of U-Report) in Bangladesh. The RapidPro flow collected the survey responses and scored them against the DHS national wealth index using the EquityTool methodology. This helped placing each U-Reporter who completed all questions into the appropriate wealth quintile. Results: With 19% of the respondents completing all questions, the respondents fell into all 5 wealth quintiles, with 79% in the top-two quintiles and only 21% in the lower-three resulting in an Equity Index of 53/100 where 100 is completely in line with Bangladesh equity distribution and 1 is the least in line. An equitable random sample of 1828 U-Reporters from among the regular and frequent respondents was subsequently created for future surveys and the sample has an Equity Index of 98/100. Conclusions: U-Report in Bangladesh does reach the poorest quintiles while the initial recruitment skews to respondents towards better off families. It is possible to create an equitable random sub-sample of respondents from all five wealth quintiles and thus process information and data for future surveys. Moving forward, U-Reporters from the poorly represented quintiles may be incentivized to recruit peers to increase equity and representation. In times of COVID-19, U-Report in combination with the EquityTool has the potential to enhance the quality of crowdsourced data for statistical analysis.","Powell, James; Brooks, Christopher; Watanabe, Miku; Balaji, Lakshmi N",J Glob Health,669,21

Self-neglect is often seen in addition to one or multiple conditions of frailty, mild to severe dementia, poor sleep and depression. While awareness of elder self-neglect as a public health condition and intervention has significantly risen in the past decade as evidenced by the increasing amount of literature available, research on self-neglect still lacks comprehensiveness and clarity since its inception to the medical literature in the late 1960s. With the burgeoning of the older adult population, commonness of self-neglect will most likely increase as the current incidence rate represents only the ""tip of the iceberg"" theory given that most cases are unreported. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the incidence of self-neglect in aged populations and the need for the use of intervention tools for aging adults and geriatric patients living alone, many of which may include in-home artificial intelligence systems. Despite this, little research has been conducted on aspects of self-neglect other than definition and identification. Substantial further study of this disorder's etiology, educating society on early detection, and conceivably preventing this syndrome altogether or at least halting progression and abating its severity is needed. The purpose of this research is to provide a definition of severe self-neglect, identify key concepts related to self-neglect, comprehensively describe this syndrome, present a conceptual framework and analyze the model for its usefulness, generalizability, parsimony, and testability.","Pickens, S.; Daniel, M.; Jones, E.

METHODS: Data were collected for all patients who contacted North East Ambulance Service between 4 March 2019-2 June 2019 and 2 March 2020-31 May 2020 suffering stroke, ST elevation myocardial infarction, allergy, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, falls, intoxication, seizure, sepsis, acute coronary syndrome and OHCA. RESULTS: There were a reduction in incidence of calls, excluding OHCA, resulting in ambulance activation during the pandemic compared with same period in 2019, 16 743 versus 19 639, respectively (-14.74%). The decline in calls was partially reversed by the end of May 2020. Incidence of OHCA at the time of the national lockdown had increased by 13.79% with a peak increase of 73.56% in the second week in April 2020. OHCA deaths peaked in the first 2 weeks in April 2020, 95.65% and 90.07%, respectively, but by the end May 2020, incidence of OHCA and OHCA deaths had returned to prelockdown levels. CONCLUSION: Incidence of emergency calls were reduced during the pandemic compared with 2019. There was a rise in incidence of OHCA and OHCA deaths during the same period; however, these changes appear transient. Further research is required to understand patient behaviour towards seeking help during the pandemic and the long-term consequences of not doing so.","Charlton, Karl; Limmer, Matthew; Moore, Hayley",Emerg Med J,669,20

The occurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax in these patients might be higher than the fact, and we should pay high clinical attention to them. METHOD: Data regarding clinical investigation, laboratory investigation, diagnosis, and treatment measures of 21 COVID-19 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax from January to March of 2020 were collected and analyzed in this study. RESULTS: Seven patients had a history of basic lung diseases. All patients used different methods of oxygen therapy before the occurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax according to the severity of the COVID-19, including 18 patients with ventilator-assisted breathing, 2 patients with bilevel positive airway pressure assisted breathing, and 1 patient with mask oxygen inhalation. All patients were confirmed cases of COVID-19 by chest CT (computed tomography) and virus nucleic acid detection and were found to have spontaneous pneumothorax through physical examination, bedside X-ray, and/or bedside ultrasound. 13 of 21 patients combined with pleural effusion at the same time. All the patients underwent closed thoracic drainage for spontaneous pneumothorax and the pleural effusion, if any. Nine patients died, and 12 patients recovered smoothly. CONCLUSION: Spontaneous pneumothorax might be an overlooked complication of COVID-19 patients and may be associated with poor prognosis.","Guo, Qiannan; Yang, Peiwen; Barnabo Nampoukime, Kan-Paatib; Ma, Ke; Wang, Haihao",Thorac. cardiovasc. surg,669,1

Rapid reviews (RRs) strike a balance between rigour and rapidity to minimise bias and optimise transparency within specified constraints. Methods: This review article appraised the methods and reporting standards of a convenience sample of RR protocols and RRs of COVID-19 clinical management questions, published in the first six-months of 2020. Inclusion criteria were all RR protocols evaluating traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) registered on PROSPERO, and all RRs indexed on PubMed or published on the Oxford COVID-19 Evidence Service. A purpose-specific 9-item reporting checklist reflecting recommended minimum requirements for RRs was applied. Findings were synthesised and narrated in the context of methodological considerations for conducting and reporting RRs of TCIM. Results: Included studies were five RR protocols of TCIM and 16 RRs, of which five considered TCIM. Wide variations in RR methods were proposed or applied, as were the reporting standards. All five RRs that evaluated TCIM had the lowest reporting standards that limited reproducibility and transparency. Despite accepted recommendations, most RRs did not publish a protocol. Conclusions: We propose that specific research disciplines, such as TCIM, have a uniqueness that may lead to unacceptable outputs if minimum methodological standards are not applied. The recommended minimum requirements will optimise the credibility of rapid reviews of TCIM and limit the risk of prematurely disregarding a potentially effective intervention.","Hunter, Jennifer; Arentz, Susan; Goldenberg, Joshua; Yang, Guoyan; Beardsley, Jennifer; Lee, Myeong Soo; Myers, Stephen P",Integr Med Res,669,16

Small non-coding RNAs (snRNAs) play critical roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses by regulating target gene expression, but their roles in drought stress tolerance in apple (Malus domestica) are poorly understood. Here, we identified various snRNAs and their targets from the wild apple species Malus sieversii via high-throughput sequencing and degradome analysis. Forty known microRNAs (miRNAs) and eight new snRNAs were differentially expressed in response to 2 or 4 h of drought stress treatment. We experimentally verified the expression patterns of five selected miRNAs and their targets. We established that one miRNA, mdm-miR171i, specifically targeted and degraded SCARECROW-LIKE PROTEINS 26.1 (MsSCL26.1) transcripts. Both knockout of mdm-miR171i and overexpression of MsSCL26.1 improved drought stress tolerance in the cultivated apple line 'GL-3' (M. domestica Borkh.) by regulating the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes, especially that of MONODEHYDROASCORBATE REDUCTASE (MsMDHAR), which functions in ascorbic acid (AsA) metabolism under drought stress. Transient expression analysis demonstrated that MsSCL26.1 activates MsMDHAR transcription by positively regulating the activity of the P1 region in its promoter. Therefore, the miR171i-SCL26.1 module enhances drought stress tolerance in apple by regulating antioxidant gene expression and AsA metabolism.","Wang, Yantao; Feng, Chen; Zhai, Zefeng; Peng, Xiang; Wang, Yanyan; Sun, Yueting; Li, Jian; Shen, Xiaoshuai; Xiao, Yuqin; Zhu, Shengjiao; Huang, Xuewang; Li, Tian Hong",Plant physiol,669,16

It is urgent to conduct prediction research on the development and spread of the epidemic. In this article, a hybrid artificial-intelligence (AI) model is proposed for COVID-19 prediction. First, as traditional epidemic models treat all individuals with coronavirus as having the same infection rate, an improved susceptible-infected (ISI) model is proposed to estimate the variety of the infection rates for analyzing the transmission laws and development trend. Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public's prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction. The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic. Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52%, 0.38%, 0.05%, and 0.86% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively.","Zheng, Nanning; Du, Shaoyi; Wang, Jianji; Zhang, He; Cui, Wenting; Kang, Zijian; Yang, Tao; Lou, Bin; Chi, Yuting; Long, Hong; Ma, Mei; Yuan, Qi; Zhang, Shupei; Zhang, Dong; Ye, Feng; Xin, Jingmin",IEEE Trans Cybern,669,20

Emergence of antiviral resistance is a major impediment in the control of the coinfection. In this paper, a deterministic mathematical model illustrating the transmission dynamics of influenza pneumonia coinfection is formulated having incorporated antiviral resistance. Optimal control theory is then applied to investigate optimal strategies for controlling the coinfection using prevalence reduction and treatment as the system control variables. Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal control. The derived optimality system is solved numerically using the Runge-Kutta-based forward-backward sweep method. Simulation results reveal that implementation of prevention measures is sufficient to eradicate influenza pneumonia coinfection from a given population.

Our paper addresses a lack of in-depth qualitative research exploring their experiences and perceptions of how life has changed at this time. METHODS: We used qualitative interviews (N = 49) to explore experiences of the pandemic for people with pre-existing mental health conditions. In a participatory, coproduced approach, researchers with lived experiences of mental health conditions conducted interviews and analysed data as part of a multi-disciplinary research team. RESULTS: Existing mental health difficulties were exacerbated for many people. People experienced specific psychological impacts of the pandemic, struggles with social connectedness, and inadequate access to mental health services, while some found new ways to cope and connect to the community. New remote ways to access mental health care, including digital solutions, provided continuity of care for some but presented substantial barriers for others. People from black and ethnic minority (BAME) communities experienced heightened anxiety, stigma and racism associated with the pandemic, further impacting their mental health. CONCLUSION: There is a need for evidence-based solutions to achieve accessible and effective mental health care in response to the pandemic, especially remote approaches to care.

After transmission to animals, the virus accumulates mutations in its genome as adaptation to the new animal host progresses. Therefore, we investigated whether these mutations result in mismatches with the diagnostic PCR assays and suggested proper modifications to the oligo sequences accordingly. A comprehensive bioinformatic analysis was conducted using 28 diagnostic PCR assays and 793 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from animals. Sixteen out of the investigated 28 PCR assays displayed at least one mismatch with their targets at the 0.5% threshold. Mismatches were detected in seven, two, two, and six assays targeting the ORF1ab, spike, envelope, and nucleocapsid genes, respectively. Several of these mismatches, such as the deletions and mismatches at the 3' end of the primer or probe, are expected to negatively affect the diagnostic PCR assays resulting in false-negative results. The modifications to the oligo sequences should result in stronger template binding by the oligos, better sensitivity of the assays, and higher confidence in the result. It is necessary to monitor the targets of diagnostic PCR assays for any future mutations that may occur as the virus continues to evolve in animals.","Elaswad, Ahmed; Fawzy, Mohamed",,669,17

Consequently, preparing the healthy child to use face masks is strongly needed. To obtain maximal compliance, reasons for mask wearing without attempts of removing must be clearly explained. Moreover, child's will must not be forced.Conclusion: On the basis of clinical findings, we think that the universal use of facial masks seems necessary when people have to go out in their everyday lives.

Currently, two real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the upE and ORF1a regions of the MERS-CoV genome are widely used, and these are the standard assays recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The MERS outbreaks to date suggest that rapid diagnosis and subsequent isolation of infected patients, particularly superspreaders, are critical for containment. However, conventional real-time RT-PCR assays require large laboratory instruments, and amplification takes approximately 2 h. These disadvantages limit rapid diagnosis. Here, an ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR test was established comprising a multiplex assay for upE and ORF1a running on a mobile PCR1100 device. As few as five copies of the MERS-CoV RNA can be detected within 20 min using the standard WHO assays in the mobile PCR device, with the sensitivity and specificity being similar to those of a conventional real-time PCR instrument such as the LightCyler, thereby enabling timely intervention to control MERS-CoV infection.","Kazuya, Shirato; Nao, Naganori; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Kageyama, Tsutomu",Jpn J Infect Dis,669,20

This study aims to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 among Syrians in a post-conflict context. METHOD: A cross sectional web-based survey was conducted on the Syrian residents of 16 years and above. It contains questions on knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) with respect to COVID-19. Participants' demographic characteristics are recorded and analyzed. The study is conducted during the global outbreak of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 706 participants (female, 444; male, 262) were enrolled. This study included 405 participants aged between 16 and 29, 204 aged between 30 and 49, and 97 aged above 60 years. There were 642 who have a university degree and 61 who have high school degree. Among the participants 253 were students, 316 were employed, 75 work as freelancers, and 62 were unemployed. Results showed that overall knowledge score towards the disease was about 60% (mean score 3.54 ± 1.20; range 0-6). Knowledge scores significantly differed across age groups (P < 0.05), education levels (P = 0.001), and occupations (P < 0.05). Attitude and practice scores were 2.45 ± 0.81 (range 0-4), 5.90 ± 1.52 (range 0-8), respectively. Attitude scores were significantly different between males and females (P < 0.05), whereas practice scores varied significantly across gender (P < 0.05), age groups (P = 0.01), education levels (P = 0.015), occupations (P < 0.05), and according to knowledge score (P = 0.000). Results from multiple linear regression indicated that lower knowledge scores were significantly associated with lower education level (P < 0.05), whereas poor preventive practices were common among male, young and unemployed participants with significance levels of P < 0.01, P = .000, P < 0.01, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that the Syrian residents demonstrate modest knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 at the time of its global outbreak.

Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the ratio and expression of CD4 and CD8 markers in COVID-19 patients to clarify the immune characterizations of CD4 and CD8 T-cells in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples of 25 COVID-19 patients and 25 normal individuals with similar age and sex as the control group were collected. White blood cells, platelets, and lymphocytes were counted and CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes were evaluated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The number of white blood cells, lymphocytes, and platelets were reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients (P < 0.05). The difference in CD4:CD8 ratio, CD4 T-cell frequency, CD8 T-cell frequency, and CD4 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was not significant between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals (P > 0.05); however, the CD8 MFI increased significantly in COVID-19 infected patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although, there is no significant difference in the ratio of CD4 to CD8 between two groups, the expression level of CD8 in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than the normal individuals. This result suggested that the cellular immune responses triggered by COVID-19 infection were developed through overexpression of CD8 and hyperactivation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.","Ganji, Ali; Farahani, Iman; Khansarinejad, Behzad; Ghazavi, Ali; Mosayebi, Ghasem",Blood Cells Mol Dis,669,20

Blockade of interleukin-6, a key cytokine in COVID-19 pathogenesis, may improve the hypercoagulable state induced by inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor on coagulation parameters. METHODS: Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed moderate to critical COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation, who received a single 324 mg subcutaneous dose of tocilizumab on top of standard of care were enrolled in this analysis. Coagulation parameters were measured before tocilizumab and at day 1, 3, and 7 after treatment. All patients were followed-up for 35 days after admission or until death. RESULTS: 70 patients (mean age 60 years, interquartile range 52-75) were included. Treatment with tocilizumab was associated with a reduction in D-dimer levels (-56%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -68% to -44%), fibrinogen (-48%; 95%CI, -60% to -35%), C-reactive protein (-93%; 95%CI, -99% to -87%), prothrombin time (-4%; 95%CI,-9% to 0.8%), and activated thromboplastin time (-4%; 95%CI,-8.7% to 0.8%), and an increase in platelet count (34%; 95%CI, 23% to 45%). These changes occurred already one day after treatment with sustained reductions throughout day 7.

One key T cell signalling module is mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) which are activated in response to antigen receptor engagement. The activity of ERKs is often used to report antigen receptor occupancy but the full details of how ERKs control T cell activation is not understood. Accordingly, we have used mass spectrometry to explore how ERK signalling pathways control antigen receptor driven proteome restructuring in CD8+ T cells to gain insights about the biological processes controlled by ERKs in primary lymphocytes. Quantitative analysis of >8000 proteins identified 900 ERK regulated proteins in activated CD8+ T cells. The data identify both positive and negative regulatory roles for ERKs during T cell activation and reveal that ERK signalling primarily controls the repertoire of transcription factors, cytokines and cytokine receptors expressed by activated T cells. It was striking that a large proportion of the proteome restructuring that is driven by triggering of the T cell antigen receptor is not dependent on ERK activation. However, the selective targets of the ERK signalling module include the critical effector molecules and the cytokines that allow T cell communication with other immune cells to mediate adaptive immune responses.","Damasio, Marcos P; Marchingo, Julia M; Spinelli, Laura; Hukelmann, Jens; Cantrell, Doreen; Howden, Andrew J M",Biochem. j,669,16

Analyze the clinical presentation, management, and outcomes. DESIGN: Descriptive retrospective observational study. SETTING: Mancha-Centro Hospital (Spain). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Population: Symptomatic pregnant women with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Between the 12th of March and 17th of April 2020, all the symptomatic pregnancies were screened with diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2. Data collection was done by reviewing the medical records and telephone interviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical characteristics, management, treatment, and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty patients with positive COVID-19 diagnostic test out of thirty-four suspected. The most common symptoms were fever (70%), cough (65%) and myalgia (35%). A unique symptom of presentation in 20% of cases. COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed in 30% by chest X-ray and one case had pulmonary embolism associated diagnosed by CT-Scan. Thromboprophylaxis was indicated in 16 out of 20 patients. Eight women finished their pregnancy during the observation period. Type of birth: 25% natural birth, 12.5% assisted vaginal delivery and 62.5% caesarean section. We had three severe cases, two of them with intensive care support. All neonates had negative test for COVID 19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend universal screening of all pregnant woman for COVID-19 during the pandemic because of the limits of the symptomatic screening seen in this studio and the ratio of asymptomatic pregnancies with positive test for COVID-19 recently published.","Ortiz Molina, Elias; Hernandez Pailos, Rafael; Pola Guillen, Maria; Pascual Pedreno, Ana; Rodriguez Rodriguez, Eduardo; Hernandez Martinez, Antonio",Ginekol Pol,669,26

Sooner or later the limitations to their mobility enforce them to bed and to more frequent hospitalizations. We include among these patients at risk those who are negative for the SARS-COV-2 infection, but suffering with COVID-19 pandemic syndrome. Beside managements of psychological symptoms, it is mandatory to offer to the last group physical rehabilitation approaches easy to learn and self-managed at home. Inspired by the proven capability to recover skeletal muscle contractility and strength by home-based volitional exercises and functional electrical stimulation, we suggest also for chronic COVID-19 pandemic syndrome a 10-20 min long daily routine of easy and safe physical exercises that can activate, and recover from weakness, the main 400 skeletal muscles used for every-day mobility activities. Persons can do many of them in bed (Full-Body in-Bed Gym), and hospitalized patients can learn this light training before leaving the hospital. It is, indeed, an extension of well-established cardiovascular-respiratory rehabilitation training performed after heavy surgical interventions. Blood pressure readings, monitored before and after daily routine, demonstrate a transient decrease in peripheral resistance due to increased blood flow of many muscles. Continued regularly, Full-Body in-Bed Gym may help maintaining independence of frail people, including those suffering with the COVID-19 pandemic syndrome.","Carraro, Ugo; Albertin, Giovanna; Martini, Alessandro; Giuriati, Walter; Guidolin, Diego; Masiero, Stefano; Kern, Helmut; Hofer, Christian; Marcante, Andrea; Ravara, Barbara",,669,22

We evaluated implementation of a POCT platform at a large, acute care hospital in the Midwestern United States. Methods: We used lactate testing as part of a sepsis bundle protocol to evaluate compliance and mortality outcomes. Respiratory team members were surveyed to assess perception of efficiency, ease of use, timely patient care, and overall engagement with the POCT system. Annualized cost per test of a benchtop analyzer and a POCT platform were compared across 3 years for each platform. Results: Lactate testing volume increased from 61% to 91%, which was associated with improved sepsis bundle protocol compliance. Employees reported high levels of engagement, improvements in efficiency and time savings, and better patient care with POCT. Average cost per test was $10.02 for the benchtop system and $6.21 for the POCT platform. POCT saved our institution $88,476 annually in labor costs. Discussion: Combined with a robust training program emphasizing the use of lactate testing in the context of the overall clinical picture, POCT enabled adherence to the sepsis bundle protocol and may have contributed to lower mortality. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has provided us with unanticipated benefits of using POCT;it has enhanced our ability to deal with stringent infectious disease protocols, saving time and minimizing patient and staff exposure. Conclusions: Implementation of a POCT platform was associated with improved compliance to our sepsis protocol, reduced sepsis mortality, high employee engagement, and cost savings.","Chase, R.

OBJECTIVES: To determine effectiveness of (a) hand-held narrowband-UVB (NB-UVB) and (b) combination of potent topical corticosteroid (TCS) and NB-UVB compared to TCS, for localised vitiligo. METHODS: Pragmatic, 3-arm, placebo-controlled RCT (9 months' treatment; 12 months' follow-up). Adults and children, recruited from secondary care and community, aged &#8805;5 years with active vitiligo affecting <10% of skin, were randomised 1:1:1 to receive: TCS (mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment + dummy NB-UVB); NB-UVB (NB-UVB + placebo TCS); or combination (TCS + NB-UVB). TCS applied once daily on alternating weeks; NB-UVB administered alternate days in escalating doses, adjusted for erythema. PRIMARY OUTCOME: treatment success at 9 months at target patch assessed using participant-reported Vitiligo Noticeability Scale, with multiple imputation for missing data. RESULTS: 517 participants were randomised: TCS (n=173), NB-UVB (n = 169), combination (n=175). Primary outcome data were available for 370 (72%) participants. Target patch treatment success was 17% (TCS), 22% (NB-UVB) and 27% (combination). Combination treatment was superior to TCS: adjusted between group difference 10.9% (95% CI 1.0% to 20.9%; p= 0.032; NNT=10). NB-UVB alone was not superior to TCS: adjusted between group difference 5.2% (95% CI -4.4% to 14.9%; p= 0.290; NNT=19). Participants using interventions >75% expected were more likely to achieve treatment success, but effects were lost once treatment stopped. Localised grade 3 or 4 erythema was reported in 62 (12%) participants (including 3 with dummy light). Skin thinning was reported in 13 (2.5%) participants (including 1 with placebo ointment). CONCLUSION: Combination treatment with home-based hand-held NB-UVB plus TCS is likely to be superior to TCS alone for treatment of localised vitiligo. Combination treatment was relatively safe and well tolerated but was only successful in around a quarter of participants.","Thomas, K S; Batchelor, J M; Akram, P; Chalmers, J R; Haines, R H; Meakin, G D; Duley, L; Ravenscroft, J C; Rogers, A; Sach, T H; Santer, M; Tan, W; White, J; Whitton, M E; Williams, H C; Cheung, S T; Hamad, H; Wright, A; Ingram, J R; Levell, N J; Goulding, J M R; Makrygeorgou, A; Bewley, A; Ogboli, M; Stainforth, J; Ferguson, A; Laguda, B; Wahie, S; Ellis, R; Azad, J; Rajasekaran, A; Eleftheriadou, V; Montgomery, A A",Br. j. dermatol,669,24

Despite documented kidney tropism of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are no consistent reports of viral detection in urine or correlation with AKI or COVID-19 severity. Here we hypothesize that quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in urine sediment from COVID-19 patients correlates with occurrence of AKI and mortality. Methods SARS-CoV-2 viral load in urine sediments (U-viral load) was quantified by qRT-PCR in 52 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalized between March 15th and June 8th, 2020. Immunolabeling of SARS-CoV-2 proteins Spike and Nucleocapsid was performed in two COVID-19 kidney biopsies and urine sediments. Viral infectivity assays were performed from 32 urine sediments. Results Twenty COVID-19 patients (39%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 U-viral load, of which 17 (85%) developed AKI with an average U-viral load 4-times higher than non-AKI COVID-19 patients. U-viral load was highest (7.7-fold) within two weeks after AKI diagnosis. A higher U-viral load correlated with mortality but not with albuminuria or AKI stage. SARS-CoV-2 proteins partially colocalized with the viral receptor ACE2 in kidney biopsies in tubules and parietal cells, and in urine sediment cells. Infective SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in urine sediments. Conclusion Our results further support SARS-CoV-2 kidney tropism. A higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load in urine sediments from COVID-19 patients correlated with increased incidence of AKI and mortality. Urinary viral detection could inform medical care of COVID-19 patients with kidney injury to improve prognosis.","Caceres, Paulo; Savickas, Gina; Murray, Shannon; Umanath, Kausik; Uduman, Junior; Yee, Jerry; Liao, Tang-Dong; Bolin, Steven; Levin, Albert; Khan, Moomal; Sarkar, Sarah; Fitzgerald, Jamie; Maskey, Dipak; Ormsby, Adrian; Sharma, Yuvraj; Ortiz, Pablo",J.

Here, we proposed a simple but sensitive on-site testing method based on spike protein-conjugated quantum dot (QD) nanotag-integrated lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) to simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG in human serum. Advanced silica-core@dual QD-shell nanocomposites (SiO2@DQD) with superior luminescence and stability were prepared to serve as fluorescent nanotags in the LFA strip and guarantee high sensitivity and reliability of the assay. The performance of the SiO2@DQD-strip was fully optimized and confirmed by using 10 positive serum samples from COVID-19 patients and 10 negative samples from patients with other respiratory diseases. The practical clinical value of the assay was further evaluated by testing 316 serum samples (114 positive and 202 negative samples). The overall detection sensitivity and specificity reached 97.37% (111/114) and 95.54% (193/202), respectively, indicating the huge potential of our proposed method for the rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2-infected persons and asymptomatic carriers.","Wang, Chongwen; Shi, Dawei; Wan, Nan; Yang, Xingsheng; Liu, Haifeng; Gao, Huixia; Zhang, Minli; Bai, Zikun; Li, Dingchen; Dai, Erhei; Rong, Zhen; Wang, Shengqi",Analyst,669,24

Validated surveys can guide improvement and future expansion of telehealth programs. Introduction: This study examines physician and advanced practice provider perspectives and satisfaction using telehealth at UPMC Pinnacle and to assess key predictors of future use in ambulatory care. Methods: A web-based Likert scale survey of UPMC Pinnacle physicians and advanced practice providers was conducted in May-June 2020. Cronbach's alpha was used to measure the survey's internal consistency. Crosstab analysis and multivariate regression were used to analyze the interrelationships between variables. Results: A significant majority (64%) of physicians responded positively that they enjoyed telehealth video visits. A majority (65%) felt that the physician-patient relationship was unimpaired during telehealth visits, but only 29% of the respondents felt they were able to examine the patients properly. Providers who experienced good video and audio quality were 3.68 times more likely to enjoy telehealth visits (p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval 2.05-6.61) than those with less-than-optimal video and audio quality. Logistic regression shows a strong correlation between the audio and image quality and respondents' satisfaction with telehealth. Discussion: The key barriers for patients when using telehealth are perceived to be the ability to use a smartphone app, password management, or video/microphone features. For clinicians, barriers include problems with seeing and hearing on the platform.

METHODS: We performed literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Ovid to identify research articles that studied outcomes of in-hospital cardiac arrest in COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was survival at discharge. Secondary outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and types of cardiac arrest. Pooled percentages with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for the prevalence of outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 7,891 COVID patients were included in the study. There were 621 (pooled prevalence 8%, 95% CI 4-13%) cardiac arrest patients. There were 52 (pooled prevalence 3.0%; 95% CI 0.0-10.0%) patients that survived at the time of discharge. ROSC was achieved in 202 (pooled prevalence 39%;95% CI 21.0-59.0%) patients. Mean time to ROSC was 7.74 (95% CI 7.51-7.98) min.

We analyzed case-data from the United States to investigate effects of temperature, precipitation, and UV Light on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Daily reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 across the United States from 01/22/2020 to 04/03/2020 were analyzed. We used negative binomial regression modelling to investigate whether daily maximum temperature, precipitation, UV Index and the incidence 5 days later were related. We performed sensitivity analyses at 3 days, 7 days and 9 days to assess transmission lags. RESULTS: A maximum temperature greater than 52°F on a given day was associated with a lower rate of new cases at 5 days[IRR: 0.85(0.76,0.96)p=0.009]. Among observations with daily temperatures below 52°F, there was a significant inverse association between the maximum daily temperature and the rate of cases at 5 days [IRR 0.98(0.97,0.99)p=0.001]. The rate of new cases was predicted to be lower for theoretical states that maintained a stable maximum daily temperature above 52°F with a predicted 23-fewer cases per-million per-day by 25 days of the epidemic. A 1-unit higher UV index was associated with a lower rate at 5 days [IRR 0.97(0.95,0.99)p=0.004]. Precipitation was not associated with a greater rate of cases at 5 days [IRR 0.98(0.89,1.08)p=0.65]. CONCLUSION: The incidence of disease declines with increasing temperature up until 52°F and is lower at warmer versus cooler temperatures. However, the association between temperature and transmission is small and transmission is likely to remain high at warmer temperatures.","Sehra, Shiv T; Salciccioli, Justin D; Wiebe, Douglas J; Fundin, Shelby; Baker, Joshua F",Clin. infect. dis,669,16

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Twelve hospitals in northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women with COVID-19-confirmed infection who delivered. EXPOSURE: COVID 19 infection in pregnancy. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-infected women who were admitted and delivered from 1 to 20 March 2020 were eligible. Data were collected from the clinical records using a standardised questionnaire on maternal general characteristics, any medical or obstetric co-morbidity, course of pregnancy, clinical signs and symptoms, treatment of COVID 19 infection, mode of delivery, neonatal data and breastfeeding. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Data on mode of delivery and neonatal outcome. RESULTS: In all, 42 women with COVID-19 delivered at the participating centres; 24 (57.1%, 95% CI 41.0-72.3) delivered vaginally. An elective caesarean section was performed in 18/42 (42.9%, 95% CI 27.7-59.0) cases: in eight cases the indication was unrelated to COVID-19 infection. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 19/42 (45.2%, 95% CI 29.8-61.3) cases: of these, 7/19 (36.8%, 95% CI 16.3-61.6) required oxygen support and 4/19 (21.1%, 95% CI 6.1-45.6) were admitted to a critical care unit. Two women with COVID-19 breastfed without a mask because infection was diagnosed in the postpartum period: their newborns tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 infection. In one case, a newborn had a positive test after a vaginal operative delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Although postpartum infection cannot be excluded with 100% certainty, these findings suggest that vaginal delivery is associated with a low risk of intrapartum SARS-Cov-2 transmission to the newborn.

To take advantage of this, many hypoxia-mimicking scaffolds have been prepared, yet the oxygen access state of implanted artificial small-diameter vascular grafts (SDVGs) has not been investigated. Therefore, the oxygen access state of electrospun PCL grafts implanted into rat abdominal arteries was assessed. The regions proximal to the lumen and abluminal surfaces of the graft walls were normoxic and only the interior of the graft walls was hypoxic. In light of this differential oxygen access state of the implanted grafts and the critical role of vascular regeneration on SDVG implantation success, we investigated whether modification of SDVGs with HIF-1&#945; stabilizer dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) could achieve hypoxia-mimicking responses resulting in improving vascular regeneration throughout the entirety of the graft wall. Therefore, DMOG-loaded PCL grafts were fabricated by electrospinning, to support the sustained release of DMOG over two weeks. In vitro experiments indicated that DMOG-loaded PCL mats had significant biological advantages, including: promotion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) proliferation, migration and production of pro-angiogenic factors; and the stimulation of M2 macrophage polarization, which in-turn promoted macrophage regulation of HUVECs migration and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) contractile phenotype. These beneficial effects were downstream of HIF-1&#945; stabilization in HUVECs and macrophages in normoxic conditions. Our results indicated that DMOG-loaded PCL grafts improved endothelialization, contractile SMCs regeneration, vascularization and modulated the inflammatory reaction of grafts in abdominal artery replacement models, thus promoting vascular regeneration.","Rafique, Muhammad; Wei, Tingting; Sun, Qiqi; Midgley, Adam C; Huang, Ziqi; Wang, Ting; Shafiq, Muhammad; Zhi, Dengke; Si, Jianghua; Yan, Hongyu; Kong, Deling; Wang, Kai",Biomaterials,669,29

To ensure that body donors are ethically acquired and suitable for anatomy education, Anatomical Donation Programs (ADPs) are tasked with the responsibility of acquiring body donors for basic and clinical science curricula. Considering the personal and institutional impact of SARS-CoV-2, a national survey was conducted to examine the current effect of the pandemic on ADP protocols, body donation, and the sustainability of ADPs in the United States (U.S.). Eighty-nine U.S. ADPs were identified and contacted for optional participation in a survey to assess the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on their programs. Survey data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools. Thirty-six ADPs (40.5% response rate) from the nine U.S. Divisions are represented in the survey results. Data were collected on ADP descriptions and demographics, SARS-CoV-2 impact on ADPs and protocols, and body donation and ADP sustainability. Almost all ADPs reported that the pandemic has affected their ADP operations in some way; however, the sustainability for the majority of ADPs appears likely and donor availability remains stable due to a proportional decrease in body donations and body donor requests. As the long-term impact on ADPs has yet to be determined, the authors plan to reevaluate the lasting impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on body donation, ADP sustainability, and anatomical science education throughout the year 2021.","McCumber, Travis L; Latacha, Kimberly S; Lomneth, Carol S",Clin. anat,669,26

This calls for a more disciplined social lifestyle in the future. However, only social distancing and quarantine of the exposed population are found not sufficient enough to end the pandemic in India. Therefore, implementation of other stringent policies like complete lockdown as well as increased testing of susceptible populations is necessary.

We observed a transcriptional upregulation of the Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein (ATR) in infected cells. In addition, we observed enhanced phosphorylation of CHK1, a downstream effector of the ATR DNA damage response, as well as H2AX. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection lowered the expression of TRF2 shelterin-protein complex, and reduced telomere lengths in infected Vero E6 cells.

BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading around the globe and interferes with the provision of dental care for many individuals from different communities and backgrounds. A search for the literature on PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library from March 1, 2020 to December 30, 2020 was conducted. Also, the bibliographies included in the indicated articles were used to identify further literature. Recommendations by health authorities in different countries were also consulted. RESULTS: COVID-19 is causing many fatalities and is disrupting people's daily life and the economy in many countries around the world. Due to the potential of cross-infection through dental treatments, especially dental aerosol generation procedures, the dental profession has been disrupted during this pandemic. Dental care provision has been ceased completely or partially (limited to emergency or urgent treatment) in most countries around the world. Until this pandemic is controlled by new suitable treatments and/or vaccination, there is an urgent need to adopt immediate guidelines and standards for the safe provision of dental care to meet patients' demands, especially for the dental aerosols. CONCLUSION: Guidelines and standards for dental treatment amidst the COVID-19 pandemic are required. This manuscript provides an overview of the COVID-19 pandemic from dental perspectives and presents standards and guidelines of dental care provision based on available research in this field as well as clinical experience and practice.

In the circumstances, many factors make parliamentary oversight of the executive a strategic function for the democratic legitimacy of policy-making. Evaluating the role of parliaments in this domain is the main purpose of this article. It traces and assesses oversight initiatives started by parliaments in Europe in order to evaluate: what types of interaction they are developing with the executives; whether the oversight procedures have been changed, either in a temporary or permanent way; and what sort of influence the oversight function has had on the final outcome of decision-making. The comparative analysis demonstrates that parliaments have followed a realistic and incremental approach to ensure continuity of executive oversight, prioritising the mechanisms that they deemed to be strategic and also feasible in terms of logistical arrangements. Drawing on the lessons learned from this experience, it is questioned whether some of the new oversight (digital) practices should be made permanent. It is argued that prospectively an appropriate and full use of oversight prerogatives will be the marker of parliaments’ ability to create opportunity out of the crisis.","Griglio, Elena",Theo.

METHODS: a rapid review of published and grey literature on COVID-19 pandemic was conducted following predefined eligibility criteria by searching electronic databases, repositories of pre-print articles, websites and databases of international health, and research related institutions and organisations. RESULTS: of 584 initially identified records up to 5 July 2020, 19 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Most of the studies (No. 11) used the reproduction number (Rt) as a measure of effect and in all of them areduction of the estimated value at post-intervention period was found. The implementation of lockdown in 11 European countries was associated with an average 82% reduction of Rt, ranging from a posterior Rt of 0.44 (95%CI 0.26-0.61) for Norway to a posterior Rt of 0.82 (95%CI 0.73- 0.93) for Belgium. Changes in infection rates and transmission rates were estimated in 8 studies. Daily changes in infection rates ranged from -0.6% (Sweden) to -11.3% (Hubei and Guangdong provinces). Additionally, other studies reported a change in the trend of hospitalizations (Italy, Spain) and positive effects on the doubling time of cases (Hubei, China) after lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: results of this rapid review suggest a positive effect of the containment measures on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, with a major effect in countries where lockdown started early and was more restrictive. Rigorous research is warranted to evaluate which approach is the most effective in each stage of the epidemic and in specific social contexts, in particular addressing if these approaches should be implemented on the whole population or target specific risk groups.","Caristia, Silvia; Ferranti, Margherita; Skrami, Edira; Raffetti, Elena; Pierannunzio, Daniela; Palladino, Raffeele; Carle, Flavia; Saracci, Rodolfo; Badaloni, Chiara; Barone-Adesi, Francesco; Belleudi, Valeria; Ancona, Carla",Epidemiol Prev,669,10

This is not the first nor will it be the last time that a member of ß-coronaviruses (CoVs) is waging a full-scale war against human health. Notwithstanding the fact that pneumonia is the primary symptom of the novel coronavirus (2019nCoV; designated as SARS-CoV-2), the emergence of severe disease mainly due to the injury of nonpulmonary organs at the shadow of coagulopathy leaves no choice, in some cases, rather than a dreadful death. Multiple casual factors such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, platelet and complement activation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system derangement, and hypoxemia play a major role in the pathogenesis of coagulopathy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Due to the undeniable role of coagulation dysfunction in the initiation of several complications, assessment of coagulation parameters and the platelet count would be beneficial in early diagnosis and also timely prediction of disease severity. Although low-molecular-weight heparin is considered as the first-line of treatment in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, several possible therapeutic options have also been proposed for better management of the disease. In conclusion, this review would help us to gain insight into the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, and laboratory findings associated with COVID-19 coagulopathy and would summarize management strategies to alleviate coagulopathy-related complications.","Kohansal Vajari, Mahdi; Shirin, Mahsa; Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi, Atieh; Akbari, Mohammad Esmaeil; Abolghasemi, Hassan; Bashash, Davood",Cell biol. int,669,1

Lack of pre-existing immunity against this newly emerging virus has pushed the urgent development of anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines to reduce the spread of the virus and alleviate disease. Appropriate animal models recapitulating the pathogenesis of and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans have and will continue to accelerate this development process. Several animal models including mice, hamsters, ferrets, and non-human primates have been evaluated and actively applied in preclinical studies. However, since each animal model has unique features, it is necessary to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of each according to the goals of the study.

Effective therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to reduce the spread of the virus and its death toll. Here, we assess the possibility of using interferon-lambda (IFN&#955;), a third type of interferon sharing low homology with type I IFNs and IL-10, for treating COVID-19 patients. We discuss the unique role of IFN&#955; in fine-tuning antiviral immunity in the respiratory tract to achieve optimal protection and minimal host damage and review early evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may impair IFN&#955; induction, leading to a delayed type I IFN-dominated response that triggers hyperinflammation and severe disease. We also consider the potential windows of opportunity for therapeutic intervention with IFN&#955; and potential safety considerations. We conclude that IFN&#955; constitutes a promising therapeutic agent for reducing viral presence and hyperinflammation in a single shot to prevent the devastating consequences of COVID-19 such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).","Andreakos, Evangelos; Tsiodras, Sotirios",EMBO Mol Med,669,30

Participants defined educational disruptions as the phenomenon when a plan is created by an individual or school and interrupted by the unplanned with overlapping and intersecting effects along a continuum of physical, social, and emotional well-being that potentially result in individualized trauma. Participants experienced educational disruption through their understandings of: (1) the purpose of education, (2) beliefs about education, (3) curriculum, (4) instruction, (5) assessment, and (6) child guidance and classroom community. Our findings highlight the need for COEs to understand the role of education within community and societies during educational disruptions to meet the needs of diverse students in an ethical and equitable manner.

A panel of geneticists worked on the development of this consensus, in which not only patients with Down syndrome were included, but the search was extended to patients with other types of disabilities, in both pediatric and adult ages in order to contribute to the development of public health measures against the COVID-19 pandemic. The consensus concludes that, given the prevalence of comorbidities associated with Down syndrome, the higher incidence of cases with severe COVID-19 in this population group and a higher mortality, individuals with trisomy 21 should be considered as a high-risk population, and therefore, vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 should have a high priority for all people with Down syndrome regardless of their age (except for the age limit established by the clinical trials of each vaccine), and should be preceded only by the groups of health personnel and adults aged ≥ 60-65 years. Likewise, this group of experts urges health authorities to include people with intellectual disabilities and related conditions as a priority population (other chromosomal abnormalities other than Down syndrome, intellectual disability, congenital anomalies and conditions that cause disability with microcephaly), as well as the caregivers of people with this type of conditions. Vaccination in children with this type of disorders should be considered as part of the first priority group, once safe vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available for use in children and adolescents. © 2021, Sociedad Chilena de Pediatria.

We first created four host-pathogen interaction (HPI)-Outcome postulates, and generated a HPI-Outcome model as the basis for understanding host-coronavirus interactions (HCI) and their relations with the disease outcomes. We hypothesized that ontology can be used as an integrative platform to classify and analyze HCI and disease outcomes. Accordingly, we annotated and categorized different coronaviruses, hosts, and phenotypes using ontologies and identified their relations. Various COVID-19 phenotypes are hypothesized to be caused by the backend HCI mechanisms. To further identify the causal HCI-outcome relations, we collected 35 experimentally-verified HCI protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and applied literature mining to identify additional host PPIs in response to coronavirus infections. The results were formulated in a logical ontology representation for integrative HCI-outcome understanding. Using known PPIs as baits, we also developed and applied a domain-inferred prediction method to predict new PPIs and identified their pathological targets on multiple organs. Overall, our proposed ontology-based integrative framework combined with computational predictions can be used to support fundamental understanding of the intricate interactions between human patients and coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) and their association with various disease outcomes.","Yu, Hong; Li, Li; Huang, Hsin-hui; Wang, Yang; Liu, Yingtong; Ong, Edison; Huffman, Anthony; Zeng, Tao; Zhang, Jingsong; Li, Pengpai; Liu, Zhiping; Zhang, Xiangyan; Ye, Xianwei; Handelman, Samuel K.; Higgins, Gerry; Omenn, Gilbert S.; Athey, Brian; Hur, Junguk; Chen, Luonan; He, Yongqun",,669,1

To examine shelter characteristics and infection prevention practices in relation to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection point prevalence during universal testing at homeless shelters in the United States.Methods. SARS-CoV-2 testing was offered to clients and staff at homeless shelters, irrespective of symptoms. Site assessments were conducted from March 30 to June 1, 2020, to collect information on shelter characteristics and infection prevention practices. We assessed the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence and shelter characteristics, including 20 infection prevention practices by using crude risk ratios (RRs) and exact unconditional 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results. Site assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing results were reported for 63 homeless shelters in 7 US urban areas. Median infection prevalence was 2.9% (range = 0%-71.4%). Shelters implementing head-to-toe sleeping and excluding symptomatic staff from working were less likely to have high infection prevalence (RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.3, 0.8; and RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.4, 0.6; respectively); shelters with medical services available were less likely to have very high infection prevalence (RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.2, 1.0).Conclusions. Sleeping arrangements and staffing policies are modifiable factors that might be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in homeless shelters. Shelters should follow recommended practices to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Self, Julie L; Montgomery, Martha P; Toews, Karrie-Ann; Samuels, Elizabeth A; Imbert, Elizabeth; McMichael, Temet M; Marx, Grace E; Lohff, Cortland; Andrews, Tom; Ghinai, Isaac; Mosites, Emily",Am J Public Health,669,1

Here, we have utilised RNA-seq to define cellular pathways regulated by ILRUN in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of Caco-2 cells. We find that inhibition of ILRUN expression by RNA interference alters transcription profile of numerous cellular pathways, including upregulation of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and several other members of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system. In addition, transcripts of the SARS-CoV-2 co-receptors TMPRSS2 and CTSL were also upregulated. Inhibition of ILRUN also resulted in increased SARS-CoV-2 replication, while overexpression of ILRUN had the opposite effect, identifying ILRUN as a novel antiviral factor for SARS-CoV-2 replication and represents, to our knowledge, the first report of ILRUN as a regulator of the RAAS.IMPORTANCEThere is no doubt that the current rapid global spread of COVID-19 has had significant and far-reaching impacts on our health and economy and will continue to do so. Research in emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is growing rapidly, with new breakthroughs in the understanding of host-virus interactions in order to assist with the development of innovative and exciting therapeutic strategies. Here we present the first evidence that modulation of the human protein-encoding gene ILRUN functions as an antiviral factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, likely through its newly identified role in regulating the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL.

There is growing recognition that digital technologies have the potential to improve the well-being of frontline workers. However, there has been limited development of wellness interventions using mobile health (mHealth) technology. More importantly, little research has been conducted on how frontline workers perceive mHealth-based support to promote their well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore frontline workers' experience of conventional psychological wellness programs and their perceptions of the usefulness of mHealth apps and features for promoting well-being. It also sought to identify factors that could potentially influence uptake and retention of an mHealth-based wellness program. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews using purposive sampling with frontline workers involved in the COVID-19 response. Various visual materials, collated from existing mHealth app features, were presented to facilitate discussion. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis based on grounded theory was undertaken. Themes were subsequently mapped to key nudge strategies-those commonly used for mHealth development-to assess participants' preferences for particular features and their reasoning. RESULTS: A total of 42 frontline workers participated in 12 one-on-one interviews or focus group discussions. Frontline workers generally had a limited ability to identify their own psychological problems and liked the reminders functionality of the app to track their mood over time. A personalized goal-setting feature (ie, tailoring) and in-app resources were generally valued, while frequent coaching and messages (ie, framing) were seen as a distraction. The majority of participants desired a built-in chat function with a counselor (ie, guidance) for reasons of accessibility and protection of privacy. Very few participants appreciated a gamification function. Frontline workers commonly reported the need for ongoing social support and desired access to an in-app peer support community (ie, social influence). There were, however, concerns regarding potential risks from virtual peer interactions. Intrinsic motivational factors, mHealth app technicality, and tangible rewards were identified as critical for uptake and retention. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the potential of mHealth apps with relevant features to be used as wellness tools by frontline health care workers. Future work should focus on developing a nonintrusive and personalized mHealth app with in-app counseling, peer support to improve well-being, and tangible and extrinsic rewards to foster continued use.","Yoon, Sungwon; Goh, Hendra; Nadarajan, Gayathri Devi; Sung, Sharon; Teo, Irene; Lee, Jungup; Ong, Marcus E H; Graves, Nicholas; Teo, Tess Lin",J Med Internet Res,669,3

In the study we analysed the comparison and agreement between the feasibility of using the saliva in comparison to NPS for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A total number of 74 patients were enrolled for this study. We analysed and compared the NPS and saliva specimen collected within 48 h after the symptom onset. We carried out real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), gene sequencing for the detection and determination SARS-CoV-2 specific genes. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to establish the isolation of viral RNA from saliva. We used Bland-Altman model to identify the agreement between two specimens. RESULTS: This study showed a lower cycle threshold (CT ) mean value for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 gene (mean 27.07; 95% CI, 25.62 to 28.52) in saliva methods than that of NPS (mean 28.24; 95% CI, 26.62 to 29.85) specimen although the difference is statistically non-significant (p>0.05). Bland-Altman analysis produced relatively smaller bias and high agreement between these two clinical specimens. Phylogenetic analysis with the RdRp and S gene confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva samples. CONCLUSIONS: Saliva represented a promising tool in COVID-19 diagnosis and the collection method would reduce the exposure risk of frontline health workers which is one of major concerns in primary healthcare settings.

As medical systems continue to develop vaccines and treatments, it is crucial for the public health community to establish nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that can effectively mitigate the rate of SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread across highly populated residential areas, especially among individuals who have close contact with confirmed cases. A community-driven preparedness strategy has been implemented in metropolitan areas in China. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) has required that all COVID-19 confirmed cases be recorded and documented in a national notifiable disease surveillance system (NDSS). After receiving reports of newly confirmed cases, an epidemiological services team at the CCDC or trained medical professionals at local clinical facilities start a case-contact investigation. A task force performs home visits to infected individuals.

Largely ignored are the menstruation-management needs of people experiencing homelessness. We explored these realities in New York City through in-depth interviews with individuals living on the street and in shelters (n = 22), key informant interviews with staff at government agencies, shelters and service provider organizations (n = 15), and field audits of public toilets. This paper explores both pragmatic difficulties presented by inadequate access to toilets, bathing spaces, and laundering services, and pervasive menstrual stigma. Amplifying the difficulties was near-constant pressure ""to pass,"" as someone who was not homeless in order to enable increased access to toilets, and as someone who was not menstruating, in order to engage in the activities of daily living. Our findings highlight the need for improved quality and accessibility of bathrooms for sheltered and street-dwelling homeless, and expedited access to bathing and laundering. Such actions are essential given the steady increase in homelessness in NYC and - under the long shadow of COVID - especially timely.","Sommer, Marni; Gruer, Caitlin; Smith, Rachel Clark; Maroko, Andrew",Health Place,669,16

Physical activity after transplant is the most modifiable nonpharmacological factor for improving cardiovascular outcomes. Few studies have tested walking interventions to enhance daily steps and health outcomes in older kidney recipients. METHODS: Using a pilot feasibility randomized clinical trial design, we tested the feasibility and efficacy of a 6-month SystemCHANGE (Change Habits by Applying New Goals and Experience) + Activity Tracker intervention for recruitment, retention, daily steps, and health outcomes (blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, waist circumference, and physical function). The SystemCHANGE + Activity Tracker intervention taught participants to use a multicomponent intervention that connects person-centered systems solutions combined with visual feedback from a mobile activity tracker to achieve daily step goals. RESULTS: Fifty-three participants (mean age 65 years, 66% male, and 57% white) participated with 27 in the intervention and 26 in the control group. The study protocol was feasible to deliver with high adherence to the protocol in both groups. The intervention group increased daily steps at 3 months (mean difference, 608; standard error = 283, P = .03) compared to the control group. The secondary outcome of heart rate decreased for the intervention group (baseline [mean] 74.4+ 10.8 [standard deviation, SD;] vs 6 months [mean] 67.6+ 11.3 [SD]; P = .002) compared to the control group (baseline [mean] 70.67+ 10.4 [SD]; vs 6 months [mean] 70.2 + 11.1 [SD]; P = .83).

Negative RT-PCR testing associated with positive serology in most cases suggests a post-infectious syndrome. Because the pathophysiology of this syndrome is still poorly understood, extensive virological and immunological investigations are needed. METHODS: We report a series of four pediatric patients admitted to Geneva University Hospitals with persistent fever and laboratory evidence of inflammation meeting published definition of MIS-C related to COVID-19, to whom an extensive virological and immunological workup was performed. RESULTS: RT-PCRs on multiple anatomical compartments were negative whereas anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG were strongly positive by ELISA and immunofluorescence. Both pseudo- and full virus neutralization assays showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies in all children, confirming a recent infection with SARS-CoV-2. Analyses of cytokine profiles revealed an elevation in all cytokines, as reported in adults with severe COVID-19. Although differing in clinical presentation, some features of MIS-C show phenotypic overlap with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). In contrast to patients with primary HLH, our patients showed normal perforin expression and NK cell degranulation. The levels of soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) correlated with the severity of disease, reflecting recent T-cell activation. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that MIS-C related to COVID-19 is caused by a post-infectious inflammatory syndrome associated with elevation in all cytokines, and markers of recent T-cell activation (sIL-2R) occurring despite a strong and specific humoral response to SARS-CoV2. Further functional and genetic analyses are essential to better understand the mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions.","Grazioli, Serge; Tavaglione, Fedora; Torriani, Giulia; Wagner, Noemie; Rohr, Marie; L039,; Huillier, Arnaud G; Leclercq, Charlotte; Perrin, Anne; Bordessoule, Alice; Beghetti, Maurice; Pachlopnik, Jana; Vavassori, Stefano; Perreau, Matthieu; Eberhardt, Christiane; Didierlaurent, Arnaud; Kaiser, Laurent; Eckerle, Isabella; Roux-Lombard, Pascale; Blanchard-Rohner, Geraldine",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,669,23

The problem is not limited to the government's ability to execute, but there are also systemic impediments and overlooked issues in the effective implementation of countermeasures against new coronavirus infection In this paper, we first used a systems thinking technique (causal loop diagram) to visualize the situation related to COVID-19 infection, and confirmed its characteristics as a system Our causal loop diagram consists of an ""infection model"" and an ""incidence response model"" The government and the Council of Experts) have separated the ""infection model"" from the ""incidence model"" with the goal of reducing the number of deaths and, by extension, serious illnesses as much as possible In the process, attention has been paid to avoiding the depletion of medical resources, which is probably one of the reasons why the number of tests has not been able to increase so far However, while this approach is reasonable when each model is taken separately, it turns out that there are serious systemic weaknesses that occur at the interface between the two models For example, raising the testing hurdle will increase the number of mild cases that are active in the city without being tested, increasing the chance of infection and increasing the number of new cases This will create a new spread of infection Considering this, the following two measures need to be implemented It is necessary to implement blockades or other measures to reduce the number of opportunities for infection as soon as possible, or equivalent measures to reduce the number of opportunities for infection (e g , school closures, refraining from going outside, cancellation of events, city blockades, etc ) In order to expand inspections, it is necessary to introduce an inspection system that minimizes the connection with medical resources, such as the combination of drive-through inspections and walk-through inspections, which are famous in Korea, with Internet interviews However, in the current situation where infection is spreading to a certain extent and medical resources are tight, a two-sided strategy, such as increasing the number of tests, is necessary to control the spread of infection by lightly infected people (and subclinical infected people) who spread infection in the city in order to deal with the serious systemic problems at the interface between the two models The causal loop diagram shows that citizens are also required to take measures to prevent infection, such as masks and hand washing, and to change their behavior in order to reduce the chance of infection This case is an example of the importance of system-wide understanding of the situation for both citizens and experts, and of sharing that understanding Translated with www DeepL com/Translator (free version)","Shirabe, Masashi; Toriya, Masako; Koizumi, Amane",Japanese Journal of Science Communication,669,24

Research into the mechanisms of these conditions has proposed that some of their causes (eg, macular degeneration/glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease) could be symptoms of an underlying common cause. Research into sensory-cognitive aging has provided data that sensory decline may be linked to the progression of dementia through reduced sensory stimulation. While hearing loss rehabilitation may have a beneficial effect on cognitive functioning, there are no data available on whether low vision rehabilitation, specifically for reading, could have a beneficial effect on cognitive health. OBJECTIVE: The research questions are: (1) Does low vision rehabilitation reduce reading effort? (2) If so, does reduced reading effort increase reading activity, and (3) If so, does increased reading activity improve cognitive functioning? The primary objective is to evaluate cognition before, as well as at 6 months and 12 months after, 3 weeks of low vision reading rehabilitation using magnification in individuals with age-related macular degeneration, with or without coexisting hearing impairments. We hypothesize that improvements postrehab will be observed at 6 months and maintained at 12 months for participants with vision loss and less so for those with dual sensory loss. The secondary objective is to correlate participant characteristics with all cognitive outcomes to identify which may play an important role in reading rehabilitation. METHODS: We employ a quasiexperimental approach (nonrandomized, pre-post intervention study). A 3x3 design (3 groups x 3 time points) allows us to examine whether cognitive performance will change before and after 6 months and 12 months of a low vision reading intervention, when comparing 75 low vision and 75 dual sensory impaired (vision & hearing) participants to 75 age-matched healthy controls. The study includes outcome measures of vision (eg, reading acuity and speed), cognition (eg, short-term and long-term memory, processing speed), participant descriptors, demographics, and clinical data (eg, speech perception in noise, mental health). RESULTS: The study has received approval, and recruitment began on April 24, 2019. As of March 4, 2021, 38 low vision and 7 control participants have been enrolled. Lockdown forced a pause in recruitment, which will recommence once the COVID-19 crisis has reached a point where face-to-face data collection with older adults becomes feasible again. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of protective effects caused by reading rehabilitation will have a considerable impact on the vision rehabilitation community and their clients as well as all professionals involved in the care of older adults with or without dementia. If we demonstrate that reading rehabilitation has a beneficial effect on cognition, the demand for rehabilitation services will increase, potentially preventing cognitive decline across groups of older adults at risk of developing macular degeneration.

In contrast with much of the existing literature which assumes coefficients to evolve according to a random walk, a hierarchical mixture model on the TVPs is introduced. The resulting model closely mimics a random coefficients specification which groups the TVPs into several regimes. These flexible mixtures allow for TVPs that feature a small, moderate or large number of structural breaks. We develop computationally efficient Bayesian econometric methods based on the singular value decomposition of the KT regressors. In artificial data, we find our methods to be accurate and much faster than standard approaches in terms of computation time. In an empirical exercise involving inflation forecasting using a large number of predictors, we find our models to forecast better than alternative approaches and document different patterns of parameter change than are found with approaches which assume random walk evolution of parameters.","Hauzenberger, Niko; Huber, Florian; Koop, Gary; Onorante, Luca",,669,16

In this regard, the contribution of sleep to innate and acquired immunity has attracted the attention of researchers. It has been shown that lack of sleep significantly increases the risk of adenovirus infection in healthy young people. For example, people who slept 5-6 hours were 4 times more likely to have a viral infection compared to those who slept 7 hours or more. Several studies have examined the effect of partial sleep deprivation on vaccine effectiveness. Subjects who adhered to a normal, 7-8-hour sleep schedule had a 2.5-fold higher antibody titer for the H1N1 influenza virus than those who slept 4 hours. Studies using polysomnography demonstrated that lack of sleep at night immediately after immunization against hepatitis A virus reduced both humoral and cellular immunity.

The 3D-printed face shield was evaluated in 31 interventional procedures in terms of ability to perform the assigned intervention as usual, quality of visual comfort and tolerance using a Likert scale (from 1, as very good to 5, as extremely poor). RESULTS: The mean rating for ability to perform the assigned intervention as usual was 1.7±0.8 (SD) (range: 1-4). The mean visual tolerance rating was 1.6±0.7 (SD) (range: 1-4). The mean tolerability rating was 1.4±0.7 (SD) (range: 1-3). CONCLUSION: The 3D-printed protective face shield is well accepted in various interventions. It may become an additional option for protection of interventional radiologists.","Sapoval, M; Gaultier, A L; Del Giudice, C; Pellerin, O; Kassis-Chikhani, N; Lemarteleur, V; Fouquet, V; Tapie, L; Morenton, P; Tavitian, B; Attal, J P",Diagn Interv Imaging,669,6

OBJECTIVE: By investigating this relationship through a multi-omics approach, we sought to ascertain whether patients with skin conditions are more susceptible to COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an epidemiological study and then compared gene expression across nine different inflammatory skin conditions and SARS-CoV-2 infected bronchial epithelial cell lines, then performed a GWAS trans-disease meta-analysis between COVID-19 susceptibility and two skin diseases (psoriasis and atopic dermatitis). RESULTS: Skin conditions, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, increase the risk of COVID-19 (OR=1.55, p=1.4x10-9), but decrease the risk of mechanical ventilation (OR=0.22, p=8.5x10-5). We observed significant overlap in gene expression between the infected normal bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) and inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. For genes that are commonly induced in both the SARS-CoV-2 infection and skin diseases, there are four S100 family members located in the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC), and we also identified the 'IL-17 signaling pathway' (p=4.9x10-77) as one of the most significantly enriched pathways. Furthermore, a shared genome-wide significant locus in the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) was identified between psoriasis and SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the lead marker being a significant eQTL for S100A12 (p=3.3x10-7). CONCLUSION: Together our findings suggest association between inflammatory skin conditions and higher risk of COVID-19, but with less severe course, and highlight shared components involved in anti-COVID19 immune response.","Patrick, Matthew T; Zhang, Haihan; Wasikowski, Rachael; Prens, Errol P; Weidinger, Stephan; Gudjonsson, Johann E; Elder, James T; He, Kevin; Tsoi, Lam C",J. allergy clin. immunol,669,10

Samples should be collected for cytological investigation and culture, and then the external ear should be cleaned and dried (if required). Myringotomies should be performed under general anaesthesia and, wherever possible, using a video otoscope; the enhanced view and instrument ports facilitate the technique and reduce the risk of complications. The myringotomy incision should be made in the caudoventral quadrant of the TM using an appropriately sized urinary catheter to collect samples and flush the middle ear cavity.

Since the pandemic outbreak, the general public has been responsive to the national call to stay at home in quarantine. However, since doubts and anxiety related to the disease have been detected in the general public, in this study, we established the WeChat platform ""Coronavirus Disease 2019 Voluntary Assistance Group in Sichuan and Chongqing regions"" in January 2020, which was committed to providing professional consultation and psychological counseling services for residents in Sichuan and Chongqing during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak. Our aim was to analyze the consultation practices of residents in the WeChat assistance group and provide a reference for the similar ""non-contact"" voluntary service platforms aiming to implement consultations during the late pandemic period. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using the records containing the consultation content from the WeChat assistance groups in Sichuan and Chongqing between January 30 and March 1, 2020. Data on consultation content, changes in a number of consultation items, answers, knowledge on popular science, and expert advice were summarized, and the Pareto chart was used to analyze the primary and secondary factors of consultation content. RESULTS: The constituent ratio of ""respiratory symptoms, masks, and disinfection"" in consultation content ranked as the top three factors. Cumulatively, they occupied 49.77% of the content, thus resulting as the primary factors in the consultation content. The number of consultation items suddenly increased from 10 on the first day to 116 on the 7th day, resulting in a 1060% increased rate. There were 151 consultation factors, among which 130 (86.1%) were related to the Coronavirus Disease 2019, and 21 (13.9%) were unrelated to the Coronavirus Disease 2019.

In order to determine the duration of infectivity and its correlation with reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) results and time since initial positive PCR test in this population, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 cell infectivity in nasopharyngeal samples longitudinally obtained from asymptomatic carriers who disembarked from a cruise ship during a COVID-19 outbreak. Of 166 nasopharyngeal samples collected from 39 asymptomatic carriers every 48 h until two consecutive negative PCR test results were obtained, SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from 9 PCR-positive samples which were obtained from 7 persons (18%; 7/39). Viable viruses were isolated predominantly within 7 days after the initial positive PCR test, except for one person who shed viable virus until day 15. The median crossing point (Cp) value of RT-PCR of culture-positive samples was 24.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 20.4 to 25.8; range, 17.9 to 30.3), and Cp values were significantly associated with isolation of viable virus (odds ratio, 0.496; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.329 to 0.747; P value, 0.001), which was consistent with existing data for symptomatic patients. Genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 samples consecutively obtained from a person who shed viable virus for 15 days identified the emergence of two novel single nucleotide variants (C8626T transition and C18452T transition) in the sample collected on day 15, with the latter corresponding to an amino acid substitution in nonstructural protein 14. The impact of these mutations on prolonged viable-virus shedding is unclear. These findings underscore the potential role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission.IMPORTANCE A growing number of studies suggest the potential role of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers as a major driver of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, virological assessment of asymptomatic infection has largely been limited to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), which can be persistently positive without necessarily indicating the presence of viable virus (e.g., replication-competent virus). Here, we evaluated the infectivity of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers by detecting SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects on Vero cells using longitudinally obtained nasopharyngeal samples from asymptomatic carriers. We show that asymptomatic carriers can shed viable virus until 7 days after the initial positive PCR test, with one outlier shedding until day 15. The crossing point (Cp) value of RT-PCR was the leading predictive factor for virus viability. These findings provide additional insights into the role of asymptomatic carriers as a source of transmission and highlight the importance of universal source control measures, along with isolation policy for asymptomatic carriers.","Murata, Takayuki; Sakurai, Aki; Suzuki, Masahiro; Komoto, Satoshi; Ide, Tomihiko; Ishihara, Takuma; Doi, Yohei",MSphere,669,24

The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-MPro) cleaves the long polyprotein chains to release functional proteins required for replication of the virus and thus is a potential drug target to design new chemical entities in order to inhibit the viral replication in human cells. The current study employs state of art computational methods to design novel molecules by linking molecular fragments which specifically bind to different constituent sub-pockets of the SARS-CoV-2-MPro binding site. A huge library of 191678 fragments was screened against the binding cavity of SARS-CoV-2-MPro and high affinity fragments binding to adjacent sub-pockets were tailored to generate new molecules. These newly formed molecules were further subjected to molecular docking, ADMET filters and MM-GBSA binding energy calculations to select 17 best molecules (named as MP-In1 to MP-In17), which showed comparable binding affinities and interactions with the key binding site residues as the reference ligand. The complexes of these 17 molecules and the reference molecule with SARS-CoV-2-MPro, were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations, which assessed the stabilities of their binding with SARS-CoV-2-MPro. Fifteen molecules were found to form stable complexes with SARS-CoV-2-MPro. These novel chemical entities designed specifically according to the pharmacophoric requirements of SARS-CoV-2-MPro binding pockets showed good synthetic feasibility and returned no exact match when searched against chemical databases. Considering their interactions, binding efficiencies and novel chemotypes, they can be further evaluated as potential starting points for SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery.

Masks are essentially air filters worn on the face, that should filter out as many of the dangerous particles as possible. Here the dangerous particles are the droplets containing virus that are exhaled by an infected person. Woven fabric is unlike the material used in standard air filters. Woven fabric consists of fibres twisted together into yarns that are then woven into fabric. There are therefore two lengthscales: the diameters of: (i) the fibre and (ii) the yarn. Standard air filters have only (i). To understand how woven fabrics filter, we have used confocal microscopy to take three dimensional images of woven fabric. We then used the image to perform Lattice Boltzmann simulations of the air flow through fabric. With this flow field we calculated the filtration efficiency for particles around a micrometre in diameter. We find that for particles in this size range, filtration efficiency is low ($\sim 10\%$) but increases with increasing particle size. These efficiencies are comparable to measurements made for fabrics. The low efficiency is due to most of the air flow being channeled through relatively large (tens of micrometres across) inter-yarn pores. So we conclude that our sampled fabric is expected to filter poorly due to the hierarchical structure of woven fabrics.","Anda, Ioatzin Rios de; Wilkins, Jake W.; Robinson, Joshua F.; Royall, C.

Recently, more and more studies reported that the degree of liver damages was associated with the severity of COVID-19. Although the exact mechanism of liver injury in COVID-19 patients is unknown, recent studies have made some explorations and investigations. In this review, we summarized the potential mechanisms of liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients gleaned from recently published research reports, which suggested that the progression of pre-existing liver diseases, direct damage of liver by SARS-CoV-2, systemic inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-viral drug toxicity, and hypoxia-reperfusion may be associated with liver injury in patients with COVID-19. Hypoxic liver injury due to ischemia and shock, cholestasis-related liver injury due to altered bile metabolism, and hepatocellular injury due to drug toxicity or overwhelming inflammation might occur in severe COVID-19 patients with sepsis. To understand the pathogenesis of liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, further research is needed to focus on liver-related comorbidities, the evidence of viral replication in hepatocytes and bile duct cells, histological features of liver injury, and the influence of hepatotoxic antiviral drugs. We also suggested that special attention should be paid to monitoring inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia for the prevention and treatment of liver injury in severe COVID-19 patients. A deep understanding of the mechanism of liver injury is helpful for the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Huang, Chenlu; Li, Qiang; Xu, Wei; Chen, Liang",Discov Med,669,20

We define a metric, Effective ReBreathed Volume (ERBV), that encapsulates how infectious pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, transport in air. ERBV separates environmental transport from other factors in the chain of infection, allowing quantitative comparisons among situations. Particle size affects transport, removal onto surfaces, and elimination by mitigation measures, so ERBV is presented for a range of exhaled particle diameters: 1, 10, and 100 µm. Pathogen transport depends on both proximity and confinement. If interpersonal distancing of 2 m is maintained, then confinement, not proximity, dominates rebreathing after 10-15 min in enclosed spaces for all but 100 µm particles. We analyze strategies to reduce this confinement effect. Ventilation and filtration reduce person-to-person transport of 1 µm particles (ERBV1) by 13-85% in residential and office situations. Deposition to surfaces competes with intentional removal for 10 and 100 µm particles, so the same interventions reduce ERBV10 by only 3-50%, and ERBV100 is unaffected. Prior knowledge of size-dependent ERBV would help identify transmission modes and effective interventions. This framework supports mitigation decisions in emerging situations, even before other infectious parameters are known.","Bond, Tami C; Bosco-Lauth, Angela; Farmer, Delphine K; Francisco, Paul W; Pierce, Jeffrey R; Fedak, Kristen M; Ham, Jay M; Jathar, Shantanu H; VandeWoude, Sue",Environ Sci Technol,669,21

Method This is a cross-sectional report part of a major nationwide and longitudinal project. All attendants responded to digital sociodemographics and COVID-19 questionnaires, the Extended Physician Well-Being Index (EPWBI), and the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) TOP-8 index. Results Of the 507 health workers that participated, 70.02% of them were at risk of burnout according to the Extended Well-Being Index and 57.31, 7.91 and 2.77% had a mild, moderate, and severe risk of PTSD, respectively. The most affected were the female health workers, from metropolitan or central areas of the country, and those diagnosed with COVID-19 or exposed to a person with the diagnosis. Discussion and conclusion Mexican health workers attending mindfulness sessions presented high frequencies of PTSD symptoms and burnout. Female workers at urban hospitals could be at a special risk for developing PTSD or Well-ness alterations, and thus, they must be cared for closely, particularly those having direct contact with COVID 19 positive persons.

Unlike SARS-CoV, the cause of SARS, several SARS-CoV-2 spike glycans contain sialic acid residues. In contrast to the SARS secreted glycoprotein (SGP), SARS-CoV-2 SGP are thus potential ligands for Sialic acid-binding Siglecs on host immune cells, known to regulate immune function. Such SARS-CoV-2 glycoproteins would contribute to immune deviation. CD33-related Siglecs are important immune regulators. Siglec-5 and −14 are paired receptors with opposed actions on the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is critical in early viral clearance. SGP binding in persons of Siglec-14 null genotype (30–70% in Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) persons, 10% in North Europeans) would induce unopposed inhibitory signalling, causing viral persistence through inflammasome inhibition. Siglec-3 (CD33) and Siglec-5 are expressed on CD33 myeloid derived suppressor cells (CD33 MDSC). Immunosuppressive CD33 MDSC populations are increased in all groups at risk of severe Covid-19 infection. CD33 expression is increased in persons with the CD33 rs3865444 CC allele, associated with Alzheimer's disease, who would thus show enhanced susceptibility. Viral SGP ligation of CD33, potentially in conjunction with Siglec-5, would promote expansion of CD33 MDSC cells, as occurs in cancers but at much greater scale. CD33 is expressed on CNS microglia, potentially activated by SGP penetration through the porous cribriform plate to cause anosmia. Genotyping of severe or fatal Covid-19 cases can confirm or refute this pathophysiological mechanism. Early data have confirmed extremely high-level increase of CD33 MDSC numbers in severe Covid-19 infection, consistent with the proposed mechanism.","Murch, Simon H.",Med. Hypotheses,669,22

Many have speculated on the pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of these disturbances; however, no definite answers have been produced on the topic. With this systematic review, we aimed to collect all the available evidence regarding the prevalence of OGD, the timing of their onset and their resolution, their rate of recovery and their role as diagnostic and prognostic tools for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods: A systematic review comprising all the observational studies that reported the prevalence and/or the longitudinal trajectories of OGD in COVID-19 patients, as self-reported by patients or measured through objective psychophysical tests. Results: After the selection process, 155 studies were included, with a total of 70920 patients and 105291 not-infected individuals. Prevalence reports were extremely variable across studies, with wide ranges for OD (0% - 98%) and GD (0-89%) prevalence. OGD occurred early during the disease course and only rarely preceded other symptoms; out of 30 studies with a follow-up time of at least 20 days, only in 5 studies OGD fully resolved in more than 90% of patients. OGD had low sensitivity and high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accuracy of OD and GD for infection identification was higher than 80% in 10 out of 33 studies and in 8 out of 22 studies considered, respectively. 28 out of 30 studies that studied the association between OGD and disease severity found how OGD were associated with lower rates of severe pneumonia, hospitalization and mortality. Conclusions: OGD seem to be highly prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They occur early, concomitantly with other symptoms and often persist after recovery, in some cases for months; whether a full recovery eventually occurs in all cases is not clear yet. OGD are good predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with a milder disease course.","Boscutti, A; Delvecchio, G; Pigoni, A; Cereda, G; Ciappolino, V; Bellani, M; Fusar-Poli, P; Brambilla, P",Brain Behav Immun Health,669,21

Imposed restrictions and treatment precautions may have also influenced OHCA processes-of-care. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic period on incidence, characteristics, and survival from OHCA in Victoria, Australia. METHODS: Using data from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry, we compared 380 adult OHCA patients who received resuscitation between 16th March 2020 and 12th May 2020, with 1218 cases occurring during the same dates in 2017-2019. No OHCA patients were COVID-19 positive. Arrest incidence, characteristics and survival rates were compared. Regression analysis was performed to understand the independent effect of the pandemic period on survival. RESULTS: Incidence of OHCA did not differ during the pandemic period. However, initiation of resuscitation by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) significantly decreased (46.9% versus 40.6%, pâ¯=â¯0.001). Arrests in public locations decreased in the pandemic period (20.8% versus 10.0%; pâ¯<â¯0.001), as did initial shocks by public access defibrillation/first-responders (pâ¯=â¯0.037). EMS caseload decreased during the pandemic period, however, delays to key interventions (time-to-first defibrillation, time-to-first epinephrine) significantly increased. Survival-to-discharge decreased by 50% during the pandemic period (11.7% versus 6.1%; pâ¯=â¯0.002). Survivors per million person-years dropped in 2020, resulting in 35 excess deaths per million person-years. On adjusted analysis, the pandemic period remained associated with a 50% reduction in survival-to-discharge. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic period did not influence OHCA incidence but appears to have disrupted the system-of-care in Australia. However, this could not completely explain reductions in survival.","Ball, J; Nehme, Z; Bernard, S; Stub, D; Stephenson, M; Smith, K",Resuscitation,669,1

We provide a review of medical-grade facial protection (surgical masks, N95 respirators and face shields) for healthcare workers, the safety and efficacy of decontamination methods, and the utility of alternative strategies in emergency shortages or resource-scarce settings. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of PubMed and grey literature related to facial protection and potential adaptation strategies in the setting of PPE shortages (January 2000 to March 2020). Limitations included few COVID-19-specific studies and exclusion of non-English language articles. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the evidence based on relevant healthcare settings to increase practical utility in decision-making. RESULTS: We retrieved 5462 peer-reviewed articles and 41 grey literature records. In total, we included 67 records which met inclusion criteria. Compared with surgical masks, N95 respirators perform better in laboratory testing, may provide superior protection in inpatient settings and perform equivalently in outpatient settings. Surgical mask and N95 respirator conservation strategies include extended use, reuse or decontamination, but these strategies may result in inferior protection. Limited evidence suggests that reused and improvised masks should be used when medical-grade protection is unavailable. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to critical shortages of medical-grade PPE. Alternative forms of facial protection offer inferior protection. More robust evidence is required on different types of medical-grade facial protection. As research on COVID-19 advances, investigators should continue to examine the impact on alternatives of medical-grade facial protection.","Garcia Godoy, Laura R; Jones, Amy E; Anderson, Taylor N; Fisher, Cameron L; Seeley, Kylie M L; Beeson, Erynn A; Zane, Hannah K; Peterson, Jaime W; Sullivan, Peter D",,669,21

As the COVID-19 pandemic has now affected the whole planet, even countries with moderate to strong healthcare support and expenditure have struggled to contain disease transmission and casualties. Countries affected by COVID-19 have different demographics, socioeconomic, and lifestyle health indicators. In this context, it is important to find out to what extent these parametric variations are modulating disease outcomes. To answer this, this study selected demographic, socioeconomic, and health indicators e.g., population density, percentage of the urban population, median age, health expenditure per capita, obesity, diabetes prevalence, alcohol intake, tobacco use, case fatality of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as independent variables. Countries were grouped according to these variables and influence on dependent variables e.g., COVID-19 positive tests, case fatality, and case recovery rates were statistically analyzed. The results suggested that countries with variable median age had a significantly different outcome on positive test rate (P < 0.01). Both the median age (P = 0.0397) and health expenditure per capita (P = 0.0041) showed a positive relation with case recovery. An increasing number of tests per 100 K of the population showed a positive and negative relationship with the number of positives per 100 K population (P = 0.0001) and the percentage of positive tests (P < 0.0001), respectively. Alcohol intake per capita in liter (P = 0.0046), diabetes prevalence (P = 0.0389), and NCDs mortalities (P = 0.0477) also showed a statistical relation to the case fatality rate. Further analysis revealed that countries with high healthcare expenditure along with high median age and increased urban population showed more case fatality but also had a better recovery rate. Investment in the health sector alone is insufficient in controlling the severity of the pandemic. Intelligent and sustainable healthcare both in urban and rural settings and healthy lifestyle acquired immunity may reduce disease transmission and comorbidity induced fatalities, respectively.","Ahmed, Asif; Haque, Tasnima; Rahman, Mohammad Mahmudur",Front Public Health,669,30

The masks help mitigate the risk of cross-infection via respiratory droplets; however, there are no specific guidelines on mask materials and designs that are most effective in minimizing droplet dispersal. While there have been prior studies on the performance of medical-grade masks, there are insufficient data on cloth-based coverings, which are being used by a vast majority of the general public. We use qualitative visualizations of emulated coughs and sneezes to examine how material-and design-choices impact the extent to which droplet-laden respiratory jets are blocked. Loosely folded face masks and bandana-style coverings provide minimal stopping-capability for the smallest aerosolized respiratory droplets. Well-fitted homemade masks with multiple layers of quilting fabric, and off-the-shelf cone style masks, proved to be the most effective in reducing droplet dispersal. These masks were able to curtail the speed and range of the respiratory jets significantly, albeit with some leakage through the mask material and from small gaps along the edges. Importantly, uncovered emulated coughs were able to travel notably farther than the currently recommended 6-ft distancing guideline. We outline the procedure for setting up simple visualization experiments using easily available materials, which may help healthcare professionals, medical researchers, and manufacturers in assessing the effectiveness of face masks and other personal protective equipment qualitatively.","Verma, Siddhartha; Dhanak, Manhar; Frankenfield, John",Phys.

In this study, we aimed to reveal the loss of sense of taste and smell in COVID-19 patients and to investigate whether these sensory losses are permanent in the healing process of the disease. METHOD: This prospective study included 94 COVID-19 patients. Smell and taste tests were applied to all patients. Ten days after the first test, a second test was applied to the patients with an impaired sense of smell to compare the results. RESULTS: Of the 94 patients, 55.3% were male, and the mean age was 53 ± 19.6 (21-90) years. There were 67 patients with smell and taste impairment, of whom 34 (50.7%) had smell impairment only, 3 (4.4%) had taste impairment only, and 30 (44.7%) had both smell and taste impairment. It was found that the smell scores of 55 patients with smell and taste impairment in the first evaluation were significantly higher at the second measurement; and their tasting period was significantly shortened compared to the first measurement (pË0.001). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients may present to medical centers with a broad variety signs and symptoms. This study shows that impairment in the senses of smell and taste is common in this disease and strongly associated with COVID-19 infection. However, smell and taste impairment is mostly temporary and improves during the recovery period.","Salcan, Ismail; Karakeçili, Faruk; Salcan, Sara; Ünver, Edhem; Akyüz, Sümeyye; Seçkin, Ender; Cingi, Cemal",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,669,1

This study assessed changes in mental health and help-seeking since COVID-19 restrictions in young Australians, including gender differences. METHODS: Data were drawn from a recent subsample (n = 443; 60% female; Mage = 22.0) of a prospective cohort originally recruited in secondary school to complete annual surveys. The subsample completed an additional COVID-19 survey during COVID-19 restrictions (May-June 2020), which was compared to responses from their latest annual survey (August 2019-March 2020). Mixed effect models with time and gender as the primary predictors were conducted for: (i) scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression 9-item (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) modules assessed before and during COVID-19 restrictions, and (ii) self-reported help-seeking from a health professional in February 2020, and the month preceding May-June 2020. RESULTS: Mean symptom scores increased from before to during COVID-19 restrictions on the PHQ-9 (coefficient: 1.29; 95% CI 0.72-1.86) and GAD-7 (0.78; 95% CI 0.26-1.31), but there was no increase in help-seeking over time (odds ratio 0.50; 95% CI 0.19-1.32). There was no evidence of differential changes by gender. CONCLUSIONS: This study found increases in depression and anxiety symptoms but not greater help-seeking among young Australian adults during the first wave of the pandemic. Increasing availability and awareness of accessible treatment options and psychoeducation is critical, as well as further research into risk and protective factors to help target treatment to this vulnerable age group.","Upton, Emily; Clare, Philip J; Aiken, Alexandra; Boland, Veronica C; Torres, Clara De; Bruno, Raimondo; Hutchinson, Delyse; Kypri, Kypros; Mattick, Richard; McBride, Nyanda; Peacock, Amy",Psychol Med,669,2

In this paper, we explore the role of animal farming and meat consumption in the emergence and amplification of infectious diseases. First, we discuss how meat production increases epidemic risks, either directly through increased contact with wild and farmed animals or indirectly through its impact on the environment (e.g., biodiversity loss, water use, climate change). Traditional food systems such as bushmeat and backyard farming increase the risks of disease transmission from wild animals, while intensive farming amplifies the impact of the disease due to the high density, genetic proximity, increased immunodeficiency, and live transport of farmed animals. Second, we describe the various direct and indirect costs of animal-based infectious diseases, and in particular, how these diseases can negatively impact the economy and the environment. Last, we discuss policies to reduce the social costs of infectious diseases. While existing regulatory frameworks such as the ""One Health"" approach focus on increasing farms' biosecurity and emergency preparedness, we emphasize the need to better align stakeholders' incentives and to reduce meat consumption. We discuss in particular the implementation of a ""zoonotic"" Pigouvian tax, and innovations such as insect-based food or cultured meat.","Espinosa, Romain; Tago, Damian; Treich, Nicolas",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),669,26

The process can either be automatic, semi-automatic, or manual, the first often not being sufficiently precise or easily reproducible, and the last being excessively time consuming when involving large districts with high-resolution acquisitions. A high-resolution CT of the chest is composed of hundreds of images, and this makes the manual approach excessively time consuming. Furthermore, the parenchymal alterations require an expert evaluation to be discerned from the normal appearance; thus, a semi-automatic approach to the segmentation process is, to the best of our knowledge, the most suitable when segmenting pneumonias, especially when their features are still unknown. For the studies conducted in our institute on the imaging of COVID-19, we adopted 3D Slicer, a freeware software produced by the Harvard University, and combined the threshold with the paint brush instruments to achieve fast and precise segmentation of aerated lung, ground glass opacities, and consolidations. When facing complex cases, this method still requires a considerable amount of time for proper manual adjustments, but provides an extremely efficient mean to define segments to use for further analysis, such as the calculation of the percentage of the affected lung parenchyma or texture analysis of the ground glass areas.","Cattabriga, Arrigo; Cocozza, Maria Adriana; Vara, Giulio; Coppola, Francesca; Golfieri, Rita",J. vis. exp,669,1

We implemented management protocols based on the best available evidence and consensus among multidisciplinary teams. The current study reports our experience and outcomes using this protocol-based management strategy. METHODS: We included single or bilateral LT patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab between March 1, 2020, to December 15, 2020 (n = 25; median age: 60, range 20-73 years; M: F 17:8). A group of patients with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection during 2016-18 were included to serve as a comparator group (n = 36). RESULTS: As compared to RSV, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to present with constitutional symptoms, spirometric decline, pulmonary opacities, new or worsening respiratory failure, and need for ventilator support. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were less likely to receive a multimodality treatment strategy, and they experienced worse post-infection lung function loss, functional decline, and three-month survival. A significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 needed readmission for worsening allograft function (36.4%), and chronic kidney disease at initial presentation was associated with this complication. Lower pre-morbid FEV1 appeared to increase the risk of new or worsening respiratory failure, which was associated with worse outcomes. Overall hospital survival was 88% (n = 22). Follow-up data was available for all discharged patients (median: 43.5 days, range 15-287 days).

Os IP foram: (i) intervalo de pastejo fixo aos 30 dias (30-IP) e (ii) quando o dossel interceptou 95% de radiação fotossinteticamente ativa (95-IL). Foram utilizadas vacas mestiças Holandês x Zebu (548 ± 61,0 kg PV), multíparas e com 70 ± 18,1 dias em lactação. O ajuste da capacidade de lotação por piquete foi feito de acordo com a técnica put-and-take, visando um resíduo pós-pastejo de 20 cm de altura. O intervalo de pastejo para o tratamento de 30-IP foi aproximadamente seis dias mais longo (P=0,01) comparado ao de 95-IL, a interceptação da luz pelo dossel forrageiro 2% maior. A massa total de forragem, colmo e massa morta por área foi maior (P<0,01) para o 30-IP em comparação com o 95- IL. No entanto, a taxa de lotação foi 11,3% maior (P=0,02) para o tratamento de 95- IL do que o de 30-IP. No período de pré-pastejo, o manejo de 95-IL apresentou maior (P<0,01) proporção de folhas e relação folha/colmo. A produtividade diária de leite e seus componentes foram de 16 a 28% maior (P<0,01) para 95-LI comparado a 30-IP, respectivamente. O conteúdo de matéria seca digestível in vitro e a concentração de PB no extrato pastejável foi maior (P0,02) para 95-IL em relação à 30-IP. A FDA e FDN no extrato pastejável foram maiores para 30-IP (P<0,01) em relação à 95-IL. O potencial de produção de gases a partir de carboidratos não fibrosos foi 9,4% superior para 30-IP. A produção de metano (CH4) expressa em g/kg de MSD foi maior (P<0,01) para 30-IP em comparação a 95-IL. A oferta de forragem foi maior (P<0,01) para 30-IP em comparação a 95-IL. O consumo de PB, a produção de leite, de lactose e sólidos totais foi maior (P<0,05) para 95-IL em comparação a 30-IP. Todavia os teores de gordura, de proteína, e sólidos totais foram maiores para 30-IP em comparação 95-IL. As emissões entéricas de CH4 in vivo e o consumo de água não foram influenciados pelo manejo (P>0,5). A média de consumo foi de 58 kg de água/d. Estes resultados sugerem que o manejo de 95-IL para o capim de Marandu, possibilitou a redução do intervalo de pastejo, melhora do valor nutritivo da forragem e aumento da produção e produtividade do leite em comparação à 30-IP. Entretanto a redução da produção de metano pelo melhor manejo da pastagem necessita ser mais investigado.","MOURA, ANDRE MORAIS",,669,17

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the rates and clinical relevance of PMI using different definitions in patients with left main coronary artery disease randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in the EXCEL (Evaluation of XIENCE versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization) trial. METHODS: The pre-specified protocol definition of PMI (PMIProt) required a large elevation of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), with identical threshold for both procedures. The Third Universal Definition of MI (types 4a and 5) (PMIUD) required lesser biomarker elevations but with supporting evidence of myocardial ischemia, different after PCI and CABG. For the PMIUD, troponins were used preferentially (available in 49.5% of patients), CK-MB otherwise. The multivariable relationship between each PMI type and 5-year mortality was determined. RESULTS: PMIProt occurred in 34 of 935 (3.6%) patients after PCI and 56 of 923 (6.1%) patients after CABG (difference -2.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.4% to -0.5%; p = 0.015). The corresponding rates of PMIUD were 37 (4.0%) and 20 (2.2%), respectively (difference 1.8%; 95% CI: 0.2% to 3.4%; p = 0.025). Both PMIProt and PMIUD were associated with 5-year cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.18 [95% CI: 1.13 to 4.23] and 2.87 [95% CI: 1.44 to 5.73], respectively). PMIProt was associated with a consistent hazard of cardiovascular mortality after both PCI and CABG (pinteraction = 0.86). Conversely, PMIUD was strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality after CABG (adjusted HR: 11.94; 95% CI: 4.84 to 29.47) but not after PCI (adjusted HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.35 to 3.67) (pinteraction = 0.004). Results were similar for all-cause mortality and with varying PMIUD biomarker definitions. Only large biomarker elevations (CK-MB &#8805;10× upper reference limit and troponin &#8805;70× upper reference limit) were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of PMI after PCI and CABG vary greatly with different definitions. In the EXCEL trial, the pre-specified PMIProt was associated with similar hazard after PCI and CABG, whereas PMIUD was strongly associated with mortality after CABG but not after PCI.

METHODS: We reviewed chest X-ray (CXR) features, clinical, and laboratory data of patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. The relationship with mortality was investigated by fitting a logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 246 patients were included (170 males; mean age, 63 y). Most of the patients had 1 or more comorbidity (62%); fever (95%), and cough (60%) were the most common symptoms; CXR detected abnormalities in 88.6%, mainly showing ground-glass opacities (GGO) (90%) with bilateral (64%) and peripheral (46%) distribution.Multivariate analysis showed that age (P < 0.001; mortality of 59% in patients >66 y old; 5% at a younger age) and consolidation at CXR (P = 0.001; mortality of 11% with positive CXR; 2% in those without) represented the 2 most significant independent risk factors of mortality. Chronic pathologies, such as diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and peripheral GGO at CXR also showed a significant correlation with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We identified predictive factors for the fatal outcome of COVID-19 patients. The prognostic value of these findings can be useful for optimal patient management and resource allocation.","Cellina, Michaela; Gibelli, Daniele; Valenti Pittino, Carlo; Toluian, Tahereh; Marino, Pietro; Oliva, Giancarlo",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,669,22

This paper introduces a model of the immune response to a virus. This is based upon the same sort of mean-field dynamics as used in epidemiology. However, in place of the location, clinical status, and other attributes of people in an epidemiological model, we consider the state of a virus, B and T-lymphocytes, and the antibodies they generate. Our aim is to formalise some key hypotheses as to the mechanism of resistance. We present a series of simple simulations illustrating changes to the dynamics of the immune response under these hypotheses. These include attenuated viral cell entry, pre-existing cross-reactive humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity, and enhanced T-cell dependent immunity. Finally, we illustrate the potential application of this sort of model by illustrating variational inversion (using simulated data) of this model to illustrate its use in testing hypotheses. In principle, this furnishes a fast and efficient immunological assay-based on sequential serology-that provides a (1) quantitative measure of latent immunological responses and (2) a Bayes optimal classification of the different kinds of immunological response (c.f., glucose tolerance tests used to test for insulin resistance). This may be especially useful in assessing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Parr, Thomas; Bhat, Anjali; Zeidman, Peter; Goel, Aimee; Billig, Alexander J; Moran, Rosalyn; Friston, Karl J",Sci Rep,669,16

In this study, we describe the use of immersive virtual reality (iVR) as a teaching aid for veterinary medicine students during their orthopedics clinical rotation. Student sentiments were assessed using voluntary electronic surveys taken by veterinary students before and after the rotation. The most noteworthy benefits students reported were improved engagement with the course content, information retention, radiographic interpretation, and clinical reasoning skills. Obstacles encountered during the initial stages of the program included financial and temporal investment in equipment and content development, technical troubleshooting, and motion sickness. Though it is unlikely that iVR will ever fully replace hands-on learning experiences, it presents an educational opportunity to supplement traditional learning methods, motivate students, and fill information gaps. As iVR technology continues to evolve and improve, potential applications in the veterinary curriculum grow, making the modality's use progressively more advantageous. Although this study describes its application in an orthopedic setting, the versatility of the iVR modality lends the potential for it to be implemented in a number of clinical and didactic settings.","McCaw, Katherine; West, Andrew; Duncan, Colleen; Frey, Danielle; Duerr, Felix",J Vet Med Educ,669,20

The diversity of themes identified in this paper can be grouped into the following categories of disease mapping: spatiotemporal analysis, health and social geography, environmental variables, data mining, and web-based mapping. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 is essential for its mitigation, as it helps to clarify the extent and impact of the pandemic and can aid decision making, planning and community action. Health geography highlights the interaction of public health officials, affected actors and first responders to improve estimations of disease propagation and likelihoods of new outbreaks. Attempts at interdisciplinary correlation examine health policy interventions for the siting of health/sanitary services and controls, mapping/tracking of human movement, formulation of appropriate scientific and political responses and projection of spatial diffusion and temporal trends. This review concludes that, to fight COVID-19, it is important to face the challenges from an interdisciplinary perspective, with proactive planning, international solidarity and a global perspective. This review provides useful information and insight that can support future bibliographic queries, and also serves as a resource for understanding the evolution of tools used in the management of this major global pandemic of the 21 Century. It is hoped that its findings will inspire new reflections on the COVID-19 pandemic by readers.","Franch-Pardo, Ivan; Napoletano, Brian M; Rosete-Verges, Fernando; Billa, Lawal",Sci Total Environ,669,16

Tracheostomy is an essential procedure in critically ill COVID-19 patients; however, it is an aerosol-generating technique and thus carries the risk of infection transmission. We report our experience with percutaneous tracheostomy and its safety in a real medical setting. Methods: During the COVID-19 outbreak, 13 critically ill patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Daegu Catholic University Medical Center between February 24 and April 30, 2020. Seven of these patients underwent percutaneous tracheostomy using Ciaglia Blue Rhino. The medical environment, percutaneous tracheostomy method, and COVID-19 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were retrospectively reviewed. After treatment, the COVID-19 infection status of healthcare personnel was investigated by RT-PCR. Results: The ICU contained negative pressure cohort areas and isolation rooms, and healthcare personnel wore a powered air-purifying respirator system. We performed seven cases of percutaneous tracheostomy in the same way as in patients without COVID-19. Five patients (71.4%) tested positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR at the time of tracheostomy. The median cycle threshold value for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was 30.60 (interquartile range [IQR], 25.50-36.56) in the nasopharynx and 35.04 (IQR, 28.40-36.74) in sputum. All healthcare personnel tested negative for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Conclusion: Percutaneous tracheostomy was performed with conventional methods in the negative pressure cohort area. It was safe to perform percutaneous tracheostomy in an environment of COVID-19 infection.","Kim, Eun Jin; Yoo, Eun-Hyung; Jung, Chi Young; Kim, Kyung Chan",,669,21

METHODS: This was an observational study on a cohort of 418 patients admitted to three regional hospitals in Catalonia, Spain. As primary outcomes, we studied the evolution of SAFI in the first 48hours of treatment and the time to discharge. The results were compared between patients treated and untreated with glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 1-2mg/kg/day o dexamethasone 20-40mg/day) through sub-cohort analyses matched for multiple clinical and prognostic factors, as well as through Cox multivariate models adjusted for prognostic factors. The simultaneous use of different treatments for COVID-19 was taken into account, both in sub-cohorts matching and in Cox regression. RESULTS: There were 187 patients treated with glucocorticoids; of these, 25 patients could be matched with an equivalent number of control patients. In the analysis of these matched sub-cohorts, no significant difference was observed in time to discharge (log-rank: p=0.291) or the increment in SAFI at 48hours of treatment (glucocorticoides: -0.04; controls: +0.37; p=0.095). Multivariate models using Cox regression showed a significantly longer time to discharge in patients treated with glucocorticoids (hazard ratio: 7.26; 95% IC: 3.30-15.95).

Due to environmental issues and quality of life concerns, communities are reclaiming street spaces for active modes and slowing the speeds in their downtown. Moreover, tactical urbanism, i.e., use of street space for innovative purposes other than moving automobile traffic, is becoming attractive due to reduced automobile travel demand and the need for outdoor activities in the age of COVID-19 pandemic. This study provides details of modeling an urban downtown network (the City of San Jose) using microscopic traffic simulation. The model is then applied to evaluate the effectiveness of street design changes at varying demand scenarios. The microsimulation approach was chosen because it allows for detailed modeling and visualization of the transportation networks, including movements of individual vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. The street design change demonstrated here involves one-way to two-way street conversion, but the framework of network-wide impact evaluation may also be used for complete street conversions. The base conditions network was also tested under different travel demand reduction scenarios (10%, 20%, and 30%) to identify the corridors in the city network on which the tactical urbanism strategies (e.g., open-air dining) may be best accommodated. The study provides the framework for using a microscopic model as part of a decision support system to evaluate and effectively implement complete streets/tactical urbanism strategies.","Liu, Bernice Molan Amirarsalan Mehrara Pande Anurag Howard Jonathan Alexander Serena Lou Zhiliang Transportation Research Board",,669,16

Several cytokines implicated in the COVID-19–associated cytokine storm predominantly signal through the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway. Ruxolitinib is a selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 that has been explored in small studies of patients with COVID-19–associated cytokine storm. Early clinical data from these trials, combined with a body of preclinical and clinical evidence in other inflammatory conditions, support exploration of the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in these patients in larger, well-controlled trials. Here we describe the designs of three such ongoing clinical trials. RUXCOVID is a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of ruxolitinib 5 mg twice daily (BID) vs placebo (both plus standard of care) in patients with COVID-19–associated cytokine storm. 369-DEVENT is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of ruxolitinib 5 or 15 mg BID vs placebo (all plus standard of care) in patients with COVID-19–associated acute respiratory distress syndrome who require mechanical ventilation. Patients with severe COVID-19–associated cytokine storm who are ineligible for these trials can receive ruxolitinib through an Expanded Access Program (EAP) in the United States and similar programs outside of the United States. RUXCOVID and 369-DEVENT will provide insight into the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in hospitalized patients prior to or during ventilator use.

These may have serious adverse effects and potential drug interactions with psychotropic agents. We reviewed the common agents being used across the world for the treatment of COVID-19 and investigated their drug interaction potential with psychotropic agents using several drug interaction databases and resources. A preliminary search identified the following drugs as being used to treat COVID-19 symptoms: atazanavir (ATV), azithromycin (AZI), chloroquine (CLQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCLQ), dipyridamole, famotidine (FAM), favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), nitazoxanide, remdesivir, ribavirin and tocilizumab. Many serious adverse effects and potential drug interactions with psychotropic agents were identified. The most problematic agents were found to be ATV, AZI, CLQ, HCLQ, FAM and LPV/r in terms of both pharmacokinetic as well as serious pharmacodynamic drug interactions, including QTc prolongation and neutropenia. Significant caution should be exercised if using any of the medications being trialled for the treatment of COVID-19 until robust clinical trial data are available. An even higher threshold of vigilance should be maintained for patients with pre-existing conditions and older adults due to added toxicity and drug interactions, especially with psychotropic agents.","Bishara, Delia; Kalafatis, Chris; Taylor, David",Ther.

Gastrointestinal (GI) tract can also be involved. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old man was hospitalised for COVID-19-associated pneumonia. A rapid recovery of respiratory and general symptoms was observed after 1 week of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine and broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam plus teicoplanin). No GI symptoms were reported during hospitalisation, but a lung contrast-enhancement CT (CE-CT) excluding thromboembolism showed, as collateral finding, intraperitoneal free bubbles not present on a previous CT examination; the subsequent abdominal CE-CT described pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) involving the caecum and the right colon. Ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole was started, and the 2-week follow-up CT showed the complete resolution of PI. DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of PI is poorly understood. PI involving the caecum and right colon has been described for HIV and Cytomegalovirus infections, but, to our best knowledge, never before in COVID-19. We hypothesise a multifactorial aetiopathogenesis for PI, with a possible role of the bowel wall damage and microbiota impairment due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we suggest a conservative management in the absence of symptoms.","Meini, Simone; Zini, Chiara; Passaleva, Maria Teresa; Frullini, Anna; Fusco, Francesca; Carpi, Roberto; Piani, Fiorella",,669,16

METHODS: A literature search of articles from January 2000 until April 2020 was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library to assess in vitro data of current or putative therapies for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Although in vitro studies are scarce, data regarding chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, ivermectin, lopinavir, homoharringtonine, and emetine seem promising. CONCLUSION: Scientists all over the world should work together and increase their efforts in order to find feasible and efficient solutions against this new global viral threat.","Anastasiou, Ioanna A; Eleftheriadou, Ioanna; Tentolouris, Anastasios; Tsilingiris, Dimitrios; Tentolouris, Nikolaos",Curr Med Chem,669,16

Data regarding the immunogenicity of anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 messenger RNA (anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA) vaccines in dialysis patients were published recently. We assessed the immunogenicity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in dialysis patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred-nine patients on hemodialysis (n = 85) or peritoneal dialysis (n = 24) have received two injections of 30-µg doses of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), that were administered intramuscularly 28 days apart. Those who were still seronegative after the second dose were given a third dose one month later. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were tested before and after vaccination. RESULTS: Ninety-one out of the 102 patients who had at least a one-month follow-up after the second (n = 97) or the third (n = 5) vaccine doses had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroconversion rate was 88.7% (86 out of 97 patients) among SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patients at the initiation of vaccination. Receiving immunosuppressive therapy was an independent predictive factor for non-response to vaccination. CONCLUSION: Due to high immunogenicity and safety of mRNA vaccines, we strongly recommend prioritizing a two-doses vaccination of dialysis patients. A third dose can be required in non-responders to two doses. When possible, patients waiting for a kidney transplantation, should be offered the vaccine before transplantation.","Longlune, Nathalie; Nogier, Marie Béatrice; Miedougé, Marcel; Gabilan, Charlotte; Cartou, Charles; Seigneuric, Bruno; Del Bello, Arnaud; Marion, Olivier; Faguer, Stanislas; Izopet, Jacques; Kamar, Nassim",Nephrol. dial. transplant,669,12

Here, we develop a mathematical model that quantifies the probability of post-quarantine transmission incorporating testing into travel quarantine, quarantine of traced contacts with an unknown time of infection, and quarantine of cases with a known time of exposure. We find that testing on exit (or entry and exit) can reduce the duration of a 14-day quarantine by 50%, while testing on entry shortens quarantine by at most one day. In a real-world test of our theory applied to offshore oil rig employees, 47 positives were obtained with testing on entry and exit to quarantine, of which 16 had tested negative at entry; preventing an expected nine offshore transmission events that each could have led to outbreaks. We show that appropriately timed testing can make shorter quarantines effective.","Wells, Chad R; Townsend, Jeffrey P; Pandey, Abhishek; Moghadas, Seyed M; Krieger, Gary; Singer, Burton; McDonald, Robert H; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C; Galvani, Alison P",Nat Commun,669,10

In our study, we explore the dynamics of these two measures to test whether the virus has reached its equilibrium point and to identify the main factors explaining R and CFR variability across countries. DesignA retrospective study of publicly available country-level data. SettingFifty countries having the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at the end of July 2021. ParticipantsAggregated data including 182 085 182 COVID-19 cases confirmed in the selected fifty countries from the start of the epidemic to July 31, 2021. Primary and secondary outcome measuresThe daily values of COVID-19 R and CFR measures were estimated using country-level data from the Our World in Data website. ResultsThe mean values of country-level moving averages of R and CFR went down from 1.114 and 5.51%, respectively, on July 31, 2020 to 1.059 and 2.35% on January 31, 2021 and to 1.010 and 2.17% by July 31, 2021. In parallel, the cross-country variance of R and CFR moving averages decreased from 0.015 and 0.19%, respectively, on July 31, 2020, to 0.004 and 0.02% on January 31, 2021, and stayed on a similar level by July 31, 2021. ConclusionsThe continuous decrease in the country-level moving averages of R, down to the level of 1.0, accompanied by repeated outbreaks (""waves"") in various countries, may indicate that COVID-19 has reached its point of a stable endemic equilibrium. Only a prohibitively high level of herd immunity (about 70%) can stop the endemic by reaching a stable disease-free equilibrium. Also, the average percentage of fully vaccinated population appears to be the only statistically significant factor associated with country-specific CFR, bringing it close to the level of a seasonal flu (about 0.1%) after vaccinating more than a half of a countrys population. Thus, while the currently available vaccines prove to be effective in reducing the mortality from the existing COVID-19 variants, they are unlikely to stop the spread of the virus in the foreseeable future. It is noteworthy that no statistically significant effects of government measures restricting the peoples behavior (such as lockdowns) were found in the analyzed data.

After entry into cells, corona viruses (CoV) activate aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhRs) by an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1)-independent mechanism, bypassing the IDO1-kynurenine-AhR pathway. The IDO1-kynurenine-AhR signaling pathway is used by multiple viral, microbial and parasitic pathogens to activate AhRs and to establish infections. AhRs enhance their own activity through an IDO1-AhR-IDO1 positive feedback loop prolonging activation induced by pathogens. Direct activation of AhRs by CoV induces immediate and simultaneous up-regulation of diverse AhR-dependent downstream effectors, and this, in turn, results in a ""Systemic AhR Activation Syndrome"" (SAAS) consisting of inflammation, thromboembolism, and fibrosis, culminating in multiple organ injuries, and death. Activation of AhRs by CoV may lead to diverse sets of phenotypic disease pictures depending on time after infection, overall state of health, hormonal balance, age, gender, comorbidities, but also diet and environmental factors modulating AhRs. We hypothesize that elimination of factors known to up-regulate AhRs, or implementation of measures known to down-regulate AhRs, should decrease severity of infection. Although therapies selectively down-regulating both AhR and IDO1 are currently lacking, medications in clinical use such as dexamethasone may down-regulate both AhR and IDO1 genes, as calcitriol/vitamin D3 may down-regulate the AhR gene, and tocopherol/vitamin E may down-regulate the IDO1 gene. Supplementation of calcitriol should therefore be subjected to epidemiological studies and tested in prospective trials for prevention of CoV infections, as should tocopherol, whereas dexamethasone could be tried in interventional trials. Because lack of physical exercise activates AhRs via the IDO1-kynurenine-AhR signaling pathway increasing risk of infection, physical exercise should be encouraged during quarantines and stay-at-home orders during pandemic outbreaks. Understanding which factors affect gene expression of both AhR and IDO1 may help in designing therapies to prevent and treat humans suffering from Covid-19.","Turski, Waldemar A; Wnorowski, Artur; Turski, Gabrielle N; Turski, Christopher A; Turski, Lechoslaw",Restor Neurol Neurosci,669,1

We build document classifiers using monolingual target data, e.g., provided by the customers to select parallel training data from Web crawled data. Finally, we train MT models on our automatically selected data, obtaining a system specialized to the target domain.

This allows us to model the human behavior and the impact of public health policies on the dynamics of the curve of active infected individuals during a COVID-19 epidemic outbreak. After proving the existence and global asymptotic stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points of the model with constant parameters, we consider a family of Cauchy problems, with piecewise constant parameters, and prove the existence of pseudo-oscillations between a neighborhood of the disease-free equilibrium and a neighborhood of the endemic equilibrium, in a biologically feasible region. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this pseudo-periodic solutions are related to the emergence of epidemic waves. Then, to capture the impact of mobility in the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics, we propose a complex network with six distinct regions based on COVID-19 real data from Portugal. We perform numerical simulations for the complex network model, where the objective is to determine a topology that minimizes the level of active infected individuals and the existence of topologies that are likely to worsen the level of infection. We claim that this methodology is a tool with enormous potential in the current pandemic context, and can be applied in the management of outbreaks (in regional terms) but also to manage the opening/closing of borders.","Silva, Cristiana J; Cantin, Guillaume; Cruz, Carla; Fonseca-Pinto, Rui; Passadouro, Rui; Soares Dos Santos, Estevão; Torres, Delfim F M",J Math Anal Appl,669,20

In order to detect changes in cognitive function, cognitive tests should be performed repeatedly. Currently existing cognitive tests come in only a single version, so the subject is likely to remember the contents with repeated testing. And, under the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in-person assessment should be avoided. This study was performed to develop a new cognitive test (brain assessment, BA) that has 5 versions and can be performed on a personal computer (PC) through the Internet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five thousand subjects performed the online BA, which consisted of 5 subtests: number memory, word memory, mental rotation test, N-back test, and judgment test. We standardized the raw scores (cognitive scores, CSs) using mean and standard deviation, which were 50 and 10, respectively. Then, we calculated the mean CS for each sex and age, plotted the relationships between ages and mean CSs on figures, and calculated the formula of cognitive changes during normal aging. RESULTS: The CSs of all subtests decreased with aging. The regression coefficient was from -0.31 to -0.45. It is noteworthy that in most subtests, the CSs started to increase at 85 years of age. DISCUSSION: Our BA has 5 versions and can be done on a PC using the Internet. We tested the BA in a large number of subjects, and the standard values of CSs were measured in individuals up to 89 years of age. By performing this test repeatedly, subjects can evaluate the degree of their cognitive decline. If the rate of cognitive decline is greater than that predicted using the normalized formula, the subjects can undertake strategies to improve their control of lifestyle-related diseases or other habits of daily living. CONCLUSION: The BA can be easily taken online using a PC, and its scores linearly declined with normal aging. The BA will be useful for detecting longitudinal cognitive changes and comparing them to the pattern seen in normal aging.","Satoh, Masayuki; Tabei, Ken-Ichi; Fujita, Saiko; Ota, Yoshinori",Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,669,16

Why do we need Cultural Studies in the midst of this nightmarish period? Aside from reactivating and thinking with disciplinary specificities, the COVID crisis has fairly quickly prompted a realization from the early days of the pandemic that a situation far exceeding public health has emerged, with frightening epidemiological, social, cultural, and geopolitical implications. We issued a call for critical, short, and punchy thought pieces in May 2020 and received an overwhelming number of responses globally.

The frames that we focus on include: the articulation of a cultural lifeworld of the pandemic (in a conscious attempt to connect with the lessons about the force of signification and public political deliberation learned from other pandemics, especially global AIDS);the manner in which COVID has been weaponized in government manoeuvres and in virulent forms of racialization;and the affective and bodily registers that mark our collective vulnerability.

The recovery from the COVID-19 crisis also coincides with a critical opportunity to fight against ecosystem degradation and climate change. In this opinion article, I put in perspective that by investing in ecological restoration, governments do not have to choose between economic priorities and environmental concerns. First, I describe the restoration economy and give real-world examples of how investing in restoration activities can simultaneously ease pressure on the environment and create immediate jobs and revenues. Then I suggest that to obtain political attraction, a successful restoration strategy will require a triple-bottom-line approach to ensure that in addition to environmental objectives, stakeholders integrate socioeconomic outcomes in decision-making. Finally, I conclude that a new economic approach that prioritizes investment in our ecological capital will necessitate transdisciplinary policies to build bridges across the different silos of the economy and the environment.","Mansuy, Nicolas",,669,10

Patients with thoracic cancers have been reported at higher risk to develop severe disease, and die from COVID-19. In this setting, clinical practice recommendations for the management of patients were published. We report here how these guidelines were implemented in a routine practice setting. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the characteristics, treatment regimen and modification, as well as COVID-19 status and death for all patients with thoracic malignancies scheduled for an appointment at Institute Curie from March 23rd to April 17th 2020. RESULTS: A total of 339 patients were included. Treatment strategy was modified for a total of 110 (32 %) patients because of COVID-19; these modifications were in accordance with guidelines for 92 % of patients. The majority of dose modifications were related to immune checkpoint inhibitors, for which switch to flat dosing every 4-6 weeks was made. A total of 5 (1.5 %) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 disease, 1 of whom died from disease complication. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a unique insight in the decision making for patients with thoracic malignancies in the setting of COVID-19 outbreak, showing how guidelines were implemented in the clinic, and what may be optimized in the clinical practice of thoracic oncology in the future.","Basse, Clémence; Daniel, Catherine; Livartowski, Alain; Beaucaire-Danel, Sophie; Girard, Nicolas",Lung Cancer,669,24

The current study aimed to further examine the possible impact of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on in hospital mortality. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of health insurance claims data from the second largest insurance fund in Germany, BARMER. Patients hospitalised for ST elevation (STEMI) and non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction, acute limb ischaemia (ALI), aortic rupture, acute stroke, or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) between 1 January 2017, and 31 October 2020, were included. Admission rates per 10 000 insured and mortality were compared between March - June 2017 - 2019 (pre-COVID) and March - June 2020 (COVID). Mortality rates were determined by the occurrence of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: A total of 316 718 hospitalisations were included (48.7% female, mean 72.5 years), and 21 191 (6.7%, 95% CI 6.6% - 6.8%) deaths occurred. In hospital mortality increased during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with the three previous years for patients with acute stroke from 8.3% (95% CI 8.0 - 8.5) to 9.6% (95% CI 9.1 - 10.2), while no statistically significant changes were observed for STEMI, NSTEMI, ALI, aortic rupture, and TIA. When comparing patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (2.4%, 95% CI 2.3 - 2.5) vs. non-infected patients, a higher in hospital mortality was observed for acute stroke (12.4% vs. 9.0%), ALI (14.3% vs. 5.0%), and TIA (2.7% vs. 0.3%), while no statistically significant differences were observed for STEMI, NSTEMI, and aortic rupture. CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis of claims data has provided hints of an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and increased in hospital mortality in patients with acute stroke. Furthermore, confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased mortality in patients with stroke, TIA, and ALI. Future studies are urgently needed to better understand the underlying mechanism and relationship between the new coronavirus and acute stroke.","Behrendt, Christian-Alexander; Seiffert, Moritz; Gerloff, Christian; L039,; Hoest, Helmut; Acar, Laura; Thomalla, Götz",Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,669,16

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the similarities and differences of TCM syndrome distribution in different age groups to promote the optimization of treatment strategies. Methods: This study was based on a real-world survey conducted in 3 hospitals in China. There are 1262 collected cases of MS meeting the inclusion criteria, which were divided into the young group, middle-aged group, and elderly group. Factor analysis (FA) was conducted for syndrome element extraction, and K-means cluster analysis was processed for syndrome type classification. Frequency analysis and Chi-square test were used to compare the syndrome characteristics of each group. Results: Common factors extracted were assigned to 18 syndrome elements including 11 nature syndrome elements and 7 location syndrome elements. Phlegm and dampness are the most frequent syndrome elements in general. Compared with the middle-aged group and elderly group, the young group has more obvious nature syndrome elements in heat and Qi deficiency, and location syndrome elements in the stomach. As for the middle-aged group, the frequency of location syndrome in kidney syndrome was higher than that in other groups. When it comes to the elderly group, it is shown that the symptoms of Yin deficiency and blood deficiency increase with age and the old patients may have more location syndrome elements in the lung and gallbladder. Conclusion: The TCM syndrome of MS is complex in that there may be the characteristics of deficiency and excess syndrome simultaneously. The main pathological factors of MS were phlegm and dampness. Besides, MS patients at different age periods may have their own syndrome distribution features. So, it is reasonable to adhere to the method of resolving phlegm and removing dampness and, at the same time, adopt the ways of clearing heat, promoting Qi, nourishing Yin, supplementing blood as well as regulating the liver, promoting the lung, transporting the spleen, nourishing the heart, and nourishing the kidney based on the syndrome feature of MS in different age stages.","Xia, Shujie; Cai, Jing; Chen, Jianxin; Lin, Xuejuan; Chen, Shujiao; Gao, Bizhen; Li, Candong",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,669,1

To investigate the potential intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed spike glycoprotein sequences from different animals, with particular emphasis on bats. We performed phylogenetic analysis and structural reconstruction of the spike glycoproteins with subsequent alignment and comparison. Our phylogenetic results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was more similar to the bats' betacoronavirus isolates: HKU5-related from Pipistrellus abramus and HKU4-related from Tylonycteris pachypus. We also identified a yak betacoronavirus strain, YAK/HY24/CH/2017, as the closest match in the comparison of the structural models of spike glycoproteins. Interestingly, a set of unique features has been described for this particular strain of the yak betacoronavirus. Therefore, our results suggest that the human SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the current outbreak of COVID-19, could also come from yak as an intermediate host.","Dabravolski, Siarhei Alexander; Kavalionak, Yury Kazimirovich",J. med. virol,669,10

These activities performed by port labour are deemed to be crucial for the EU and European ports, since 75% of the EU external trade and 30% of intra-EU transport goods are moved by waterborne transport. As a response to the global lockdown and the vulnerability of global supply chains, the majority of international organisations and maritime ports networks have shortlisted measures necessary to keep the severe effects of the lockdown to a minimum. One of the key measures identified is how to limit physical interaction. As an effect, millions of people and organisations across the globe have had to use and/or increase their deployment of digital technologies, such as digital documentation, tracing information systems and digital group-working platforms. Hence, blockchain and data-enabling systems have become to be recognised as a core element maintaining the uninterrupted flow of goods and services at ports. In pursuing uninterrupted trade and keeping ports open and running, this research paper addresses how the current situation afflicts the small and medium-sized ports located on the Baltic Sea which are argued to be critical actors of the port-centric logistics' ecosystem. Given the topicality of this research and addressing the research gap, the authors suggest a conceptual capacity-building framework for port employees. This suggested framework is based on empirical insights: primary and secondary data collected from the project Connect2SmallPorts, part-financed by the Interreg South Baltic Programme 2014-2020 from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The conceptual framework aims towards a practical training programme dedicated to fill in the missing skills or expand the limited competence of human resources and ports' capacity when adapting or advancing digitalisation in the ports' ecosystems. In particular, specific areas of capacity building are addressed and individual solutions suggested to foster a digital transformation of ports. The conceptual training framework is designed as a training tool indicating opportunities to help ports upgrade their competences with the blockchain technology, and to advance their transportation, environmental and economic performance with improved digitalisation. For this purpose, the conducted research employed mixed methods and applied concepts and approaches based on the field of management. For example, the construct of absorptive capacity, organisational learning, transformation, resource-based view and the concept of dynamic capabilities are included in the ecosystem discourse and are linked with open innovation and service design. The research presented in this article provides both theoretical and practical contributions, in which the affected stakeholders can test and utilise the developed tool as well as transfer it to other regions. © 2021 Christopher Meyer et al., published by Sciendo 2021.","Meyer, C.; Gerlitz, L.; Henesey, L.",TalTech Journal of European Studies,669,6

The Centers for Disease Control has consistently recommended frequent handwashing, avoiding crowds, wearing masks, and staying home as much as possible to prevent the spread of the virus. Additionally, 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico issued stay-at-home orders in the spring of 2020. Length of stay-at-home orders varied and states have also diverged on policies that mandate masks in public places. Through the lens of signaling theory and the emotion as social information model, the current research sheds light on how governors' differing policies and communication have influenced COVID-19 behavior and outcomes. Governor press briefings between January 7, 2020, and January 1, 2021, were run through the linguistic inquiry and word count software. Results indicated that states with longer stay-at-home orders and a stronger mask mandate reported fewer COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, negative emotion in governor press briefings was related to fewer cases and this relationship was mediated by individuals spending less time away from home for an extended period (3?6?h).

Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of the predicted climatic scenarios for the year 2100 on the metabolic adjustments of P. aff. brevis . Specifically, the rate of oxygen uptake, electron transport system capacity, glycogen and lactate content and the role of Na+K+-ATPases and H+-ATPase were evaluated. P. aff. brevis individuals were exposed for 15 days to the simulated climatic scenarios in climate scenario rooms, where temperature and CO2 in the air were controlled. Two rooms were used to simulate the climatic scenarios predicted by the IPCC (2014): moderate (RCP 6; 2.5 °C and 400 µatm CO2 above current levels) and extreme (RCP 8.5; 4.5 °C and 900 µatm CO2 above current levels), in addition to the ""control room"" that represents the current scenario. There was an increase in the metabolic rate (MO2) in the animals acclimated to the climate change scenarios (RCP 6 and RCP 8.5) compared to the current scenario. These responses showed a typical effect of temperature on energy demand in relation to the increase in temperature and CO2. Our data showed an increase in O2 consumption (MO2), lactate levels and H+-ATPase activity of the animals acclimated to the moderate and extreme climate change scenarios. Such adjustments presented a clear metabolic imbalance, an alteration that may imply challenges for survival, growth, distribution and reproduction in the face of the expected environmental changes for the year 2100.","Almeida-Silva, J; Campos, D F; Almeida-Val, V M F",J Therm Biol,669,10

Effective orchestration leading up to a severe weather event is a complex undertaking requiring capacity that is matched to needs. However, under the compound hurricane-pandemic scenario, the demands for evacuation assistance and the capacity to meet demands change. Pre-event planning must be adjusted and transit modified to reduce risks posed to evacuees and essential workers. This study explores how visualizations of redistributed vulnerability and transportation resources influence planning. The research identifies how transportation, emergency management, and public health officials are adapting hurricane evacuation resources during the COVID-19 pandemic using original data from compound hazard workshops and participatory stakeholder focus groups. Findings show that by the peak of hurricane season, local evacuation recommendations were favored by officials, contracts were in place for noncongregate options, and public resources were adjusted to account for those requiring congregate sheltering. A need remained for coordinating interjurisdictional information about real-time weather, resources, staffing, and traffic as well as local knowledge of roadway flooding with ongoing hazard planning.","Hill, Saige Hutton Nicole S.; Whytlaw, Jennifer L.; Juita-Elena, Yusuf Behr Joshua G.; Landaeta, Eduardo Diaz Rafael",Natural Hazards Review,669,16

Wounds can be a source of infection by allowing unconstrained entry of microorganisms into the body, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. The development of new antimicrobials (particularly antibiotics) is not keeping pace with the evolution of resistant microorganisms and novel ways of addressing this problem are urgently required. One such initiative has been the development of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes, which educate healthcare workers, and control the prescribing and targeting of antimicrobials to reduce the likelihood of AMR. Of great importance has been the European Wound Management Association (EWMA) in supporting AMS by providing practical recommendations for optimising antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of wound infection. The use of wound dressings that use a physical sequestration and retention approach rather than antimicrobial agents to reduce bacterial burden offers a novel approach that supports AMS. Bacterial-binding by dressings and their physical removal, rather than active killing, minimises their damage and hence prevents the release of damaging endotoxins. AIM: Our objective is to highlight AMS for the promotion of the judicious use of antimicrobials and to investigate how dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC)-coated dressings can support AMS goals. METHOD: MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Google Scholar were searched to identify published articles describing data relating to AMS, and the use of a variety of wound dressings in the prevention and/or treatment of wound infections. The evidence supporting alternative wound dressings that can reduce bioburden and prevent and/or treat wound infection in a manner that does not kill or damage the microorganisms (for example, by actively binding and removing intact microorganisms from wounds) were then narratively reviewed. RESULTS: The evidence reviewed here demonstrates that using bacterial-binding wound dressings that act in a physical manner (for example, DACC-coated dressings) as an alternative approach to preventing and/or treating infection in both acute and hard-to-heal wounds does not exacerbate AMR and supports AMS. CONCLUSION: Some wound dressings work via a mechanism that promotes the binding and physical uptake, sequestration and removal of intact microorganisms from the wound bed (for example, a wound dressing that uses DACC technology to successfully prevent/reduce infection). They provide a valuable tool that aligns with the requirements of AMS (for example, reducing the use of antimicrobials in wound treatment regimens) by effectively reducing wound bioburden without inducing/selecting for resistant bacteria.","Rippon, Mark G; Rogers, Alan A; Ousey, Karen",J Wound Care,669,22

There is hardly any country in any of the seven continents of the world where this virus has not spread out. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak as pandemic. Since then, with the aim of curbing the spread of this infection, many governments have been implementing lockdowns in their respective countries, along with a number of new and altogether different rules and regulations in various aspects like travelling to abroad or even interstate journeys. Many instructions are being given to the citizens so as to avoid this infection. Out of these, frequent handwashing, wearing a mask, and social distancing are the three golden rules. Aims and Objectives: After permission from Screening Ethical Committee of the Institute, this study was carried out having the novel idea to assess the awareness about the various concepts regarding the proper use of masks among the frontline health workers, that is, medicos and paramedicos, amidst this corona virus (CoV) pandemic. Materials and Methods: The participation was purely volunteer in this cross-sectional study. In this online survey, a total of 490 subjects participated. The subjects were asked to fill one questionnaire that included a total of 21 questions, out of which actually 17 questions were actually to assess the knowledge about masks. The whole study was kept anonymous. Results: The results showed that the medicos and paramedicos were sufficiently aware of the proper usage of masks, though the level of knowledge must be enhanced further and further by everyone. Conclusion: As at this time, there are no specific vaccines or medicine as treatments for CoVs, so the statement – prevention is better than cure, gains much importance. The masks are just one of the various preventive measures against COVID-19.","Arora, Jyoti; Roy, Vijay Kumar; Garg, Sumit; Kaur, Nimarpreet; Mehta, Pankaj; Gandhi, Asha",Natl. J. Physiol. Pharm.

This is a term popularized during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it is one of the most important measures to prevent the spread of this virus. However, the term 'social distancing' can be misleading, as it may imply that individuals should stop socializing. However, socializing in a safe context (i.e. over the phone, video-chat, etc.) is especially important during this time of crisis. Therefore, in this narrative review, we suggest the term 'distant socializing' as more apt expression, to promote physical distancing measures while also highlighting the importance of maintaining social bonds. Further, articles discussing the practice, implementation, measurement, and mental health effects of physical distancing are reviewed. Physical distancing is associated with psychiatric symptoms (such as anxiety and depression), suicidal ideation, and domestic violence. Further, unemployment and job insecurity have significantly increased during COVID-19, which may exacerbate these negative mental health effects. Governments, medical institutions, and public health bodies should therefore consider increasing mental health resources both during and after the pandemic, with a specific focus on frontline workers, COVID-19 survivors, and marginalized communities.","Pandi-Perumal, Seithikurippu R; Vaccarino, Sophie R; Chattu, Vijay Kumar; Zaki, Nevin F W; BaHammam, Ahmed S; Manzar, Dilshad; Maestroni, G J M; Suchecki, Deborah; Moscovitch, Adam; Zizi, Ferdinand; Jean-Louis, Girardin; Narasimhan, Meera; Ramasubramanian, Chellamuthu; Trakht, Ilya; Seeman, Mary V; Shneerson, John M; Maes, Michael; Reiter, Russel J; Kennedy, Sidney H",Pathog Glob Health,669,21

Endothelial dysfunction is partially responsible for many of the organic dysfunctions in critical illness. Reactive hyperaemia is a vascular response of the endothelium that can be measured by peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT). We aimed to assess if reactive hyperaemia is affected by critical illness and if it correlates with outcomes. Prospective study with a cohort of consecutive patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. RH-PAT was accessed on admission and on the 7th day after admission. Early and late survivors were compared to non-survivors. The effect of RH-PAT variation on late mortality was studied by a logistic regression model. The association between RH-PAT and severity scores and biomarkers of organic dysfunction was investigated by multivariate analysis. 86 patients were enrolled. Mean ln(RHI) on admission was 0.580 and was significantly lower in patients with higher severity scores (p < 0.01) and early non-survivors (0.388; p = 0.027). The model for prediction of early-mortality estimated that each 0.1 decrease in ln(RHI) increased the odds for mortality by 13%. In 39 patients, a 2nd RH-PAT measurement was performed on the 7th day. The variation of ln(RHI) was significantly different between non-survivors and survivors (- 24.2% vs. 63.9%, p = 0.026). Ln(RHI) was significantly lower in patients with renal and cardiovascular dysfunction (p < 0.01). RH-PAT is correlated with disease severity and seems to be an independent marker of early mortality, cardiovascular and renal dysfunctions. RH-PAT variation predicts late mortality. There appears to be an RH-PAT impairment in the acute phase of severe diseases that may be reversible and associated with better outcomes.","Malheiro, Luis Filipe; Gaio, Rita; Vaz da Silva, Manuel; Martins, Sandra; Sarmento, António; Santos, Lurdes",J. clin. monit. comput,669,0

In many cases these do not reflect real-life diagnostic sensitivities. Therefore, manufacturer-independent quality checks of available AgPOCTs are needed, given the potential implications of false-negative results. ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to develop a scalable approach for direct comparison of the analytical sensitivities of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antigen point-of-care tests (AgPOCTs) in order to rapidly identify poor performing products. MethodsWe present a methodology for quick assessment of the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow test stripes suitable for quality evaluation of many different products. We established reference samples with high, medium and low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads along with a SARS-CoV-2 negative control sample. Test samples were used to semi-quantitatively assess the analytical sensitivities of 32 different commercial AgPOCTs in a head-to-head comparison. ResultsAmong 32 SARS-CoV-2 AgPOCTs tested, we observe sensitivity differences across a broad range of viral loads ([~]7.0*108 to [~]1.7*105 SARS-CoV-2 genome copies per ml). 23 AgPOCTs detected the Ct25 test sample ([~]1.4*106 copies/ ml), while only five tests detected the Ct28 test sample ([~]1.7*105 copies/ ml). In the low range of analytical sensitivity we found three saliva spit tests only delivering positive results for the Ct21 sample ([~]2.2*107 copies/ ml). Comparison with published data support our AgPOCT ranking. Importantly, we identified an AgPOCT offered in many local drugstores and supermarkets, which did not reliably recognize the sample with highest viral load (Ct16 test sample with [~]7.0*108 copies/ ml) leading to serious doubts in its usefulness in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. ConclusionThe rapid sensitivity assessment procedure presented here provides useful estimations on the analytical sensitivities of 32 AgPOCTs and identified a widely-spread AgPOCT with concerningly low sensitivity.","Denzler, Anna; Jacobs, Max L.; Witte, Viktoria; Schnitzler, Paul; Denkinger, Claudia M.; Knop, Michael",,669,26

Several studies have indicated increased prevalence of strokes among coronavirus patients. However, the role of past history of stroke in COVID19 patients is still unclear. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate and summarize the level of evidence on past history of stroke in COVID19 patients. METHODS: A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines was performed in PubMed, Embase, EBSCO Host, Scopus, Science Direct, Medline, and LILACS. Eligibility criteria: We evaluated studies including patients with diagnosis of COVID 19 and a past history of stroke. Risk of bias: was evaluated with the Newcastle- Ottawa Scale (NOS) and experimental studies were evaluated using the ROBINS-I scale. RESULTS: Seven articles out of the total 213 articles were evaluated and included, involving 3244 patients with SARS VOC 2 Disease (COVID19) of which 198 had a history of cerebrovascular disease. Meta-analysis of the data was performed, observing an increase in mortality in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease compared to those with different comorbidities or those without underlying pathology (OR 2.78 95 % CI [1.42-5.46] pâ¯=â¯0.007; I2â¯=â¯49 %) showing adequate heterogeneity. The presence of publication bias was evaluated using the Egger test in a funnel plot, showing adequate. Asymmetry, indicating that there is no publication bias; however, due to the low number of included studies, we could not rule out or confirm the presence of bias.

While this reasoning mode is used regularly by physicists and physics instructors, how students make sense of and use it remains unclear. We present evidence from reasoning inventory items which indicate that many students are sense making with tools from prior math instruction, that could be developed into expert ``goes like'' thinking with direct instruction. Recommendations for further work in characterizing student sense making as a foundation for future development of instruction are made.","Zimmerman, Charlotte; Olsho, Alexis; Boudreaux, Andrew; Smith, Trevor; Eaton, Philip; Brahmia, Suzanne White",,669,1

This study investigates the association of meteorology and the new daily COVID-19 confirmed cases and the effects of the city lockdown on the variation in criteria air pollutants (CAPs) in Daegu. Ambient temperature and relative humidity were negatively correlated to the new daily cases and played an important role in the spread of COVID-19. Wind speed could enhance the virus transmission through the inhalation of aerosols and/or droplets and contact with fomites. The lockdown has directly decreased the concentrations of CAPs. In particular, reductions of 3.75% (PM10), 30.9% (PM2.5), 36.7% (NO2), 43.7% (CO), and 21.3% (SO2) between the period before and during the outbreak were observed over the entire city. An increase in O3 (71.1%) was affected by natural processes and photochemical formation other than the lockdown effects. The three central districts were the areas most affected by the virus and showed the highest reductions in CAPs (except for O3) during the outbreak. Apart from the influence of the lockdown, the decreasing trend in CAPs may be a result of the actions taken by the government to mitigate air pollutants nationwide since 2019. The results of this study can be useful for government and medical organizations to understand the behavior of the virus in the atmosphere. Further studies are necessary to explore the detailed influences of the lockdown on the environment and public life.","Vuong, Quang Tran; Thang, Phan Quang; Park, Min-Kyu; Choi, Sung-Deuk",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,669,13

Aberrant lipid metabolism in morbidly obese individuals adversely affects the COVID-19 immune response and increases disease severity. Such observations are in line with the importance of lipid metabolism in COVID-19, and point to the gut as a site for intervention as well as a therapeutic target in treating the disease. Formation of complex lipid membranes and palmitoylation of coronavirus proteins are essential during viral replication and assembly. Inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and restoration of lipid catabolism by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) impede replication of coronaviruses closely related to SARS-coronavirus-2 (CoV-2). In vitro findings and clinical data reveal that the FASN inhibitor, orlistat, and the AMPK activator, metformin, may inhibit coronavirus replication and reduce systemic inflammation to restore immune homeostasis. Such observations, along with the known mechanisms of action for these types of drugs, suggest that targeting fatty acid lipid metabolism could directly inhibit virus replication while positively impacting the patient's response to COVID-19.","Tanner, Jerome E; Alfieri, Caroline",Viruses,669,16

This variability has a substantial impact on morbidity and mortality and limits the generalizability of clinical trial results. This review aims to highlight recent studies that have proposed new innovative approaches to decipher this heterogeneity, in particular, by attempting to optimize disease classification. RECENT FINDINGS: The historical dichotomy limited/diffuse subsets based on cutaneous involvement has been challenged by studies highlighting an underestimated heterogeneity between these two subtypes and showing that presence of organ damage and autoantibody profiles markedly influenced survival beyond skin extension. Advanced computational methods using unsupervised machine learning analyses of clinical variables and/or high-throughput omics technologies, clinical variables trajectories modelling overtime or radiomics have provided significant insights on key pathogenic processes that could help defining new subgroups beyond the diffuse/limited subsets. SUMMARY: We can anticipate that a future classification of SSc patients will integrate innovative approaches encompassing clinical phenotypes, variables trajectories, serological features and innovative omics molecular signatures. It nevertheless seems crucial to also pursue the implementation and standardization of readily available and easy to use tools that can be used in clinical practice.","Sobanski, Vincent; Lescoat, Alain; Launay, David",Curr Opin Rheumatol,669,12

METHODS: This was a retrospective case series of patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across a pediatric healthcare network, including clinical features and outcomes of those with positive test results. RESULTS: Of 7256 unique children tested for SARS-CoV-2, 424 (5.8%) tested positive. Patients aged 18-21 years had the highest test positive rate (11.2%), while those aged 1-5 years had the lowest (3.9%). By race, 10.6% (226/2132) of black children tested positive vs 3.3% (117/3592) of white children. By indication for testing, 21.1% (371/1756) of patients with reported exposures or clinical symptoms tested positive vs 3.8% (53/1410) of those undergoing preprocedural or preadmission testing. Of 424 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 182 (42.9%) had no comorbidities, 87 (20.5%) had asthma, and 55 (13.0%) were obese. Overall, 52.1% had cough, 51.2% fever, and 14.6% shortness of breath. Seventy-seven (18.2%) SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were hospitalized, of whom 24 (31.2%) required respiratory support. SARS-CoV-2-targeted antiviral therapy was given to 9 patients, and immunomodulatory therapy to 18 patients. Twelve (2.8%) SARS-CoV-2-positive patients required mechanical ventilation, and 2 patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Two patients died. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of pediatric patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, the rate of infection was low but varied by testing indication. The majority of cases were mild and few children had critical illness.","Otto, William R; Geoghegan, Sarah; Posch, Leila C; Bell, Louis M; Coffin, Susan E; Sammons, Julia S; Harris, Rebecca M; Odom John, Audrey R; Luan, Xianqun; Gerber, Jeffrey S",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,669,1

Currently, there is no specific drug or vaccine besides symptomatic supportive therapy. Taking full advantage of the clinical experience of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) in preventing and controlling major epidemics such as SARS, it is an important mission for TCM to propose effective formula with immediate response and solid evidence by using modern biomedical knowledge and techniques(molecular docking assisted TCM formulation for short). In view of the high homology between the gene sequences of the novel coronavirus and SARS virus, and the similarities between the two in terms of pathogenic mechanism and clinical manifestations, our team established a rapid screening and optimization model for the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus based on clinical experience and molecular docking technology. Firstly, the clinical team and the research team pre-developed and screened TCM formula by using &quot;back-to-back&quot; manner. Then, the formula was optimized and determined by comparing and analyzing the results of the two groups. The results showed that the research team screened out 46 active ingredients from candidate TCMs that could act on the novel coronavirus S-protein-binding site of human ACE2 protein, which were mainly attributed to 7 herbs such as Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and Mori Folium. The result was largely consistent with the formula raised by the clinical group, verifying and supporting its rationality. This provides evidence for the scientific and potential efficacy of the TCM prescription from the perspective of treatment target analysis, and also suggests that the TCM prescription has the potential to directly inhibit viral infection in addition to improving clinical symptoms or syndromes. Based on this, our team optimized and formed a new anti-coronavirus TCM prescription &quot;Keguan Yihao&quot;, immediately providing the TCM prescription with certain clinical experience and objective evidence support for the prevention and treatment of new emergent infectious diseases in our hospital. The TCM prescription was combined with modern medicine symptomatic supportive treatment for clinical treatment, preliminary results showed better effect than symptomatic supportive therapy alone. This research has innovated the method mode in clinical practice and basic research integration of traditional Chinese medicine for the prevention and control of new emerging infectious diseases.

This study aims to determine time and motion in the operating room in emergent, urgent and scheduled cesarean section surgeries among pregnant COVID-19 patients. Methodology. A time and motion performance evaluation study was done by computing the following parameters: pre-induction time, pre-incision time, opening time, closing time, for both decision-to-delivery interval (DDI) and overall operative time. Results. During the study period, emergent DDI average was 2 hours and 38 minutes, emergent overall operative time was 1 hour and 31minutes, urgent DDI average was 3 hours and 51 minutes, and urgent overall operative time of 1 hour and 57 minutes. However, in both urgent and emergent cases, the recommended DDI of 30 minutes, and the average duration of 44.3 minutes for CS were not feasible. Conclusion. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the provision of surgical obstetric care and OR utilization. Due to the new safety protocol for healthcare workers and patients, there was a significant delay in DDI and overall operative time. The causes were preparation, anesthesia factors or obstetrician factors. Identifying modifiable obstacles may improve the DDI, overall operative time, and the quality of maternal and child birth care during this pandemic. © 2021 University of the Philippines Manila.

Design and method: The FLAHS 2020 survey was performed in July/August 2020 by a self-administered questionnaire sent to 6,000 individuals aged 35 years and over from Kantar Health's Métascope permanent sampling base (a representative panel of the population living in metropolitan France). A subject was declared ill with COVID if he answered Yes to the question: Have you been ill with COVID-19 with a diagnosis confirmed or not by a doctor? The representativeness of the results for the metropolitan French population was performed by adjusting the data on geographical area, living conditions, socioeconomic category, gender and age. Results: Among the 4069 adults aged 35 years and older, symptomatic COVID-19 was reported by 2.2% [CI95:1.9-2.5] of respondents. The prevalence was 2.7% [CI95:1.4-4.0] among those treated with antihypertensive medication, 2.0% [1.7-2.3] among those not treated, 1.9% [1.3-2.5] among men and 2.5% [1.9-3.1] among women. Among subjects reporting COVID-19. During lockdown, 61.9% of treated hypertensive patients [60.6-63.2] were able to have medical contact, of which 9.8% [8.5-11.1] was by telephone and 5.9% [4.6-7.2] by videoconsultation, which was more frequent in the 35-54 age group with 13.1% [12.5-16.7] than in the 75+ age group with 3.5% [1.2-5.5]. 81.4% [2.8-5.4] of treated hypertensive patients visited the pharmacy at least once, and 4.1% [2.8-5.4] had their treatment delivered at home. Discontinuation of usual treatment was reported by 0.9% [0-2.2] of hypertensive patients, with a higher frequency in those aged 75 years and over (1.7% [0-4.0]). Conclusions: In the first half of 2020 in metropolitan France, COVID-19 in its symptomatic and self-reported form concerned treated hypertensive patients and the general population in a similar way. During lockdown there was no obvious disruption of care in the treated hypertensive patients and teleconsultation had a significant development, particularly for the visio-consultation in the 35-54 age group.","Hanon, O.; Pathak, A.; Silhol, F.; Wimart, M.

We therefore analysed outcome beyond 90 days in ICU patients with COVID-19, with special focus on differences between men and women. METHODS: We identified all patient &#8805; 18 years with COVID-19 admitted between March 6 and June 30, 2020, in the Swedish Intensive Care Registry. Patients were followed until death or study end-point October 22, 2020. Association with patient sex and mortality, in addition to clinical variables, was estimated using Cox regression. We also performed a logistic regression model estimating factors associated with 90-day mortality. RESULTS: In total, 2354 patients with COVID-19 were included. Four patients were still in the ICU at study end-point. Median follow-up time was 183 days. Mortality at 90-days was 26.9%, 23.4% in women and 28.2% in men. After 90 days until end of follow-up, only 11 deaths occurred. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, male sex (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.54) remained significantly associated with mortality even after adjustments. Additionally, age, COPD/asthma, immune deficiency, malignancy, SAPS3 and admission month were associated with mortality. The logistic regression model of 90-day mortality showed almost identical results. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide study of ICU patients with COVID-19, men were at higher risk of poor long-term outcome compared to their female counterparts.

While there have been discussions that COVID-19 will accelerate the 'end of globalization and multilateralism', we have already seen the high costs of non-cooperation in responding to the virus resulting in sub-optimal use of resources, rapid spread of the virus between countries, and, ultimately, significant loss of life. In spite of their favorable demographic structures and relatively young populations, countries in the Global South are still harshly affected in both epidemiological and economic terms. Nations must find innovative ways to address health concerns and regional bodies are possible mechanisms for facilitating international cooperation on health. We delineate how regional organizations can support how countries address health threats namely by serving as a bridge between the global and national policy levels; strengthening disease surveillance; mobilizing supply chains and facilitating trade; supporting the production and procurement of medicines and supplies; and coordinating policies and work with other actors. We finalize by arguing that mechanisms for regional cooperation must be strengthened themselves in order to effectively contribute to positive health outcomes within member states.","Amaya, Ana B; De Lombaerde, Philippe",Global Health,669,10

METHODS: Data came from an online survey of United States pregnant women (n = 715), conducted in May 2020. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale were used to assess depressive symptoms, thoughts of self-harm, and moderate or severe anxiety. Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the associations of COVID-19 experiences with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Participants were racially diverse. The prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes was 36% for probable depression, 20% for thoughts of self-harm, and 22% for anxiety. Women who reported family members dying from COVID-19 had four times higher odds of having thoughts of self-harm than women who did not experience family death. Depression was more prevalent among women who canceled or reduced medical appointments. Women were more likely to have worse mental health outcomes if they expressed worry about getting financial or emotional/social support, about their pregnancy, or about family or friends. Strict social distancing was positively associated with depression. A higher proportion of adults working from home was inversely associated with depression and thoughts of self-harm. CONCLUSION: High percentages of pregnant women had symptoms of depression or anxiety, suggesting an urgent need to screen and treat mental health conditions among pregnant women during the pandemic. Pandemic-related risks and protective factors are relevant to developing tailored interventions to address the mental health of pregnant women during pandemic circumstances.","Liu, Jihong; Hung, Peiyin; Alberg, Anthony J; Hair, Nicole L; Whitaker, Kara M; Simon, Jessica; Taylor, Sherri K",Birth,669,4

Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) infects cattle and wild ruminants, both as a respiratory and enteric pathogen, and possesses a significant economic threat to the cattle industry. Transcription factors are proteins that activate or inhibit transcription through DNA binding and have become new targets for disease therapies. This study utilized in silico tools to identify potential transcription factors that can serve as biomarkers for regulation of BCoV pathogenesis in cattle, both for testing and treatment. A total of 11 genes were identified as significantly expressed during BCoV infection through literature searches and functional analyses. Eleven transcription factors were predicted to target those genes (AREB6, YY1, LMO2, C-Rel, NKX2-5, E47, RORAlpha1, HLF, E4BP4, ARNT, CREB).

ET is not synthesized by animals, including humans, but is avidly taken up from the diet, especially from mushrooms. In the current study, we elucidated the effect of ET on the hCMEC/D3 human brain endothelial cell line. Endothelial cells are exposed to high levels of the cholesterol oxidation product, 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), in patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and this process is thought to mediate pathological inflammation. 7KC induces a dose-dependent loss of cell viability and an increase in apoptosis and necrosis in the endothelial cells. A relocalization of the tight junction proteins, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-5, towards the nucleus of the cells was also observed. These effects were significantly attenuated by ET. In addition, 7KC induces marked increases in the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1ß IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#945; and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), as well as COX2 enzymatic activity, and these were significantly reduced by ET. Moreover, the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of ET were significantly reduced by co-incubation with an inhibitor of the ET transporter, OCTN1 (VHCL). This shows that ET needs to enter the endothelial cells to have a protective effect and is unlikely to act via extracellular neutralizing of 7KC. The protective effect on inflammation in brain endothelial cells suggests that ET might be useful as a nutraceutical for the prevention or management of neurovascular diseases, such as stroke and vascular dementia. Moreover, the ability of ET to cross the blood-brain barrier could point to its usefulness in combatting 7KC that is produced in the CNS during neuroinflammation, e.g. after excitotoxicity, in chronic neurodegenerative diseases, and possibly COVID-19-related neurologic complications.","Koh, Sally Shuxian; Ooi, Samantha Chia-Yi; Lui, Natalie Man-Yin; Qiong, Cao; Ho, Leona Ting-Yuke; Cheah, Irwin Kee-Mun; Halliwell, Barry; Herr, Deron R; Ong, Wei-Yi",Neuromol. med.

The impacts of lockdown policies on joint surgeries are unknown. Therefore, we assessed the effects of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions on the number of emergency and elective hip joint surgeries, and explored whether these procedures are more/less affected by lockdown restrictions than other hospital care.Patients and methods - In 1,344,355 persons aged &#8805; 35 years in the Norwegian emergency preparedness (BEREDT C19) register, we studied the daily number of persons having (1) emergency surgeries due to hip fractures, and (2) electively planned surgeries due to hip osteoarthritis before and after COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were implemented nationally on March 13, 2020, for different age and sex groups. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) reflect the after-lockdown number of surgeries divided by the before-lockdown number of surgeries.Results - After-lockdown elective hip surgeries comprised one-third the number of before-lockdown (IRR â¼0.3), which is a greater drop than that seen in all-cause elective hospital care (IRR â¼0.6). Men aged 35-69 had half the number of emergency hip fracture surgeries (IRR â¼0.6), whereas women aged &#8805; 70 had the same number of emergency hip fracture surgeries after lockdown (IRR â¼1). Only women aged 35-69 and men aged &#8805; 70 had emergency hip fracture surgery rates after lockdown comparable to what may be expected based on analyses of all-cause acute care (IRR â¼0.80)Interpretation - It is important to note for future pandemics management that lockdown restrictions may impact more on scheduled joint surgery than other scheduled hospital care. Lockdown may also impact the number of emergency joint surgeries for men aged &#8805; 35 but not those for women aged &#8805; 70.","Magnusson, Karin; Helgeland, Jon; Grøsland, Mari; Telle, Kjetil",Acta Orthop,669,30

Service planning and policy making for recovery from the pandemic and beyond should draw not only on COVID-19 experiences, but also on the substantial research evidence accumulated prior to this. OBJECTIVE: To conduct an umbrella review of systematic reviews of research literature and evidence-based guidance on tele-mental health, including both qualitative and quantitative literature. METHODS: Three databases were searched between January 2010 and August 2020 for systematic reviews meeting pre-defined criteria. Reviews retrieved were independently screened and those meeting inclusion criteria were synthesised and assessed for risk of bias. Narrative synthesis was used to report findings. RESULTS: Nineteen systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen examined clinical effectiveness, eight reported on aspects of tele-mental health implementation, ten reported on acceptability to service users and clinicians, two on cost-effectiveness and one on guidance. Most reviews were assessed as low quality. Findings suggested that video-based communication could be as effective and acceptable as face-to-face formats, at least in the short-term. Evidence was lacking on the extent of digital exclusion and how it can be overcome, and on some significant contexts such as children and young people's services and inpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS: This umbrella review suggests that tele-mental health has potential to be an effective and acceptable form of service delivery. However, we found limited evidence on impacts of large-scale implementation across catchment areas. Combining previous evidence and COVID-19 experiences may allow realistic planning for future tele-mental health implementation.","Barnett, P.; Goulding, L.; Casetta, C.; Jordan, H.; Sheridan-Rains, L.; Steare, T.; Williams, J.; Wood, L.; Gaughran, F.; Johnson, S.",J Med Internet Res,669,24

Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed. This paper describes the timeline of a live forecasting exercise with massive potential implications for planning and decision making and provides objective forecasts for the confirmed cases of COVID-19.","Petropoulos, Fotios; Makridakis, Spyros",PLoS One,669,26

However, COVID-19 associated cardiovascular manifestations are limited at present. The main purpose of this study was to identify potential candidate genes involved in COVID-19-associated heart damage by bioinformatics analysis. Differently expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using transcriptome profiles (GSE150392 and GSE4172) downloaded from the GEO database. After gene and pathway enrichment analyses, PPI network visualization, module analyses, and hub gene extraction were performed using Cytoscape software. A total of 228 (136 up and 92 downregulated) overlapping DEGs were identified at these two microarray datasets. Finally, the top hub genes (FGF2, JUN, TLR4, and VEGFA) were screened out as the critical genes among the DEGs from the PPI network. Identification of critical genes and mechanisms in any disease can lead us to better diagnosis and targeted therapy.

The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on cancer healthcare from the perspective of patients with cancer. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between June 19, 2020, to August 7, 2020, using a questionnaire designed by patients awaiting cancer surgery. We examined the impact of COVID-19 on five domains (financial status, healthcare access, stress, anxiety, and depression) and their relationship with various patient-related variables. Factors likely to determine the influence of COVID-19 on patient care were analyzed. RESULTS: A significant adverse impact was noted in all five domains (p = < 0.05), with the maximal impact felt in the domain of financial status followed by healthcare access. Patients with income levels of INR < 35 K (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.61, p < 0.05), and 35K- 100 K (AOR = 1.96, p < 0.05), married patients (AOR = 3.30, p < 0.05), and rural patients (AOR = 2.82, p < 0.05) experienced the most adverse COVID-19-related impact. CONCLUSION: Delivering quality cancer care in low to middle-income countries is a challenge even in normal times. During this pandemic, deficiencies in this fragile healthcare delivery system were exacerbated.

EXPERT OPINION: Recommendations on vaccination are still based on expert recommendations and have not been updated in recent years. Specific recommendations for each mAb have not been addressed in the current literature. The aim of this comprehensive review was to collect all the therapeutic mAbs approved up to 1 January 2020 and, based on previous recommendations and the pharmaceutical characteristics of each drug, to propose an updated guide with recommendations on vaccination. Influenza, sequential pneumococcal and Hepatitis B vaccination in patients with negative serology were the only consistent recommendations. Hepatitis A vaccination was proposed for mAbs with special hepatotoxic characteristics. Other vaccines are reviewed and discussed. Several non-immunosuppressive mAbs were detected and, therefore, vaccinations not recommended. We hope that this review can serve as a starting point for compiling updated vaccination recommendations and collecting all the therapeutic mAbs approved up to 2020.","Rivera-Izquierdo, Maria; Valero-Ubierna, Maria Del Carmen; Nieto-Gómez, Pelayo; Martínez-Bellón, María Dolores; Fernández-Martínez, Nicolás Francisco; Barranco-Quintana, José Luis",Expert Rev Vaccines,669,16

In the US, COVID-19 is now the third leading cause of death among those aged 45 through 84. Lung transplant (LTx) recipients may be at increased risk for fulminant novel SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 infection due to their immunosuppressed state. Within solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, the reported mortality rate has ranged from 5% to 40%. Observational studies of LTx recipients have noted a mortality rate of 10% to 34%. To further understand the mortality rate in LTx recipients, we retrospectively evaluated LTx patients at our center with COVID-19. Method: We identified LTx recipients infected with COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab at our institution in the Bay Area. Baseline demographics and clinical data were obtained through review of the electronic medical record (EMR) from 3/20/2020 to 12/18/20. Results: Eighteen LTx recipients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. The mean age was 55.1 years (SD ± 3.0) and the majority were male (Table 1). Eightynine percent of patients had 2 or more comorbidities, which included hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. Clinical presentation ranged from mild to severe, 11% of patients were monitored at home and 89% required hospitalization. Of those hospitalized, 50% were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). The survival rate of COVID-19 in this population was 94%. One patient who recovered from COVID-19 later died in hospice care related to other comorbidities. Conclusion: Lung transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 were mostly male and most had two or more comorbidities. Most patients had severe infection requiring hospitalization and of these, half necessitated ICU level care. The overall survival rate, however, was higher than has been reported in LTx recipients at other centers. Favorable survival outcomes may be due to disease education and prompt access to healthcare in this LTx population. Additionally, during this study period, the Bay Area did not experience the same overwhelming surge of COVID-19 cases that has been seen in other regions of the United States. Further studies are needed to evaluate factors affecting COVID-19 mortality rate in LTx patients. .","Seijo, L. L.; Perez, A.; Shah, R. J.; Kolaitis, N. A.; Venado, A.; Leard, L.

We aimed to immunophenotype peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in RRMS patients cross-sectionally and examine the characteristics and modifications of lymphopenia over time. METHODS: Characterization of PBMC was done by multiparametric flow cytometry. Patients had been on treatment for up to 4 years and were grouped into lymphopenic (DMF-L) and non-lymphopenic (DMF-N) patients. RESULTS: Lymphopenia affected the cell population changes over time, with other patient characteristics (gender, age, and previous treatment status) also having significant effects. In both lymphopenic and non-lymphopenic patients, PBMC percentages were reduced over time. While overall T and B cells frequencies were not affected, males, older patients and untreated patients had significant changes in B cell subpopulations over time. CD4+ to CD8+T cell ratio increased significantly in lymphopenic patients over time. CD4-CD8-T cell population was similarly reduced in both lymphopenic and non-lymphopenic patients, over time. While the monocyte and NK overall populations were not changed, non-classical monocyte subpopulation decreased over time in lymphopenic patients. We also found CD56-CD16+ and CD56-CD16- NK cells frequencies changed over time in lymphopenic patients. Immune populations showed correlations with clinical outcomes measured by EDSS and relapse rate. Analysis of the overall immunophenotype showed that, while groups divided by other patient characteristics showed differences, the lymphopenia status overrode these differences, resulting in similar immunophenotype within DMF-L. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that under the same therapy, lymphopenia affects how the immunophenotype changes over time and can override the differences associated with other patient characteristics and possibly mask other significant changes in the immune profile of patients.","Lee, Chieh-Hsin; Jiang, Bei; Nakhaei-Nejad, Maryam; Barilla, David; Blevins, Gregg; Giuliani, Fabrizio",Mult Scler Relat Disord,669,1

The higher functionalized quinolines can be obtained in a synthetically acceptable yield, when the above ensembles are treated with the second molecule of acylacetylenes. Thus, the further insertion of second molecule of the acetylenes into the quinoline scaffold occurs as a much slower process indicating a strong adverse substituent effect of the remote chalcone moiety.","Belyaeva, Kseniya V; Nikitina, Lina P; Afonin, Andrei V; Trofimov, Boris A",Tetrahedron,669,20

The disease is rapidly transmitting in the community. Imposed lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic have effectively delayed the transmission in the community but the transmissibility in households needs to be explored. The aim of this study was to estimate the household transmission of COVID-19 and assess the factors affecting transmission. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study where the data were collected from a single isolation center, was conducted. Patients were contacted by phone. Information regarding number of COVID-19-positive cases in the family, their demographic details, along with number of rooms in their household was collected. Results: A total of 369 families of COVID-19-positive patients were contacted. Nineteen families with a single member were excluded. Out of 350 families with a total 2126 members, 480 (22.5%) were COVID-19 positive. Mean age was 30.12 years (±14.39) and majority of them were males (68.9%). Majority of the cases (67.3%) were in the age group (19–49 years). Mean rooms per person were 0.51± 0.20 (0.14 to 1.50). Mild negative correlation was seen between number of positive COVID-19 cases and rooms per person (r= −0.138, p=0.008) while moderate negative correlation with number of family members and proportion of family members being COVID-19 positive (r= −0.542, p≤0.0001). Conclusion: One in four family members got infected with COVID-19, they were majority males and in the working age group. Negative correlation of positive cases with number of family members and mild negative correlation between rooms per person and proportion of family member affected indicates some other factors may be responsible for household transmission than these factors.","Dutta, S.; Kaur, R.

This will greatly impact cleft palate patients as it will limit their chance to receive timely care and have persistent follow-up, and that could in turn delay its management so significantly that it could cause much more considerable complications. To mitigate the issue, it seems necessary to start integrating modern-day technologies into the everyday practice of physicians and to benefit from the opportunities it provides. Much of medical decision making is cognitive, and telemedicine can provide easy access to specialists who are not immediately available. With wide internet access, this task is more than feasible. Telemedicine and other modern facilities are very promising platforms that could fill the gap that has been made by social distancing.

We present data on the experiences and actions of producers, consumers, and community organisers. The data were collected by adapting ongoing research to include surveys, interviews and online workshops focused on the pandemic. Actors' responses to the pandemic foreshadow how enduring change to food systems can be achieved. We identify support required to enable these transformations and argue that it is vital that these opportunities are embedded in food justice principles which promote people-centred approaches to avoid exacerbating injustices prevalent pre-crisis.

BACKGROUND: Lombardy was the Italian region with the highest coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) prevalence, at the end of March 2020 accounting for 20% of all worldwide deaths. Joint Gastro-Intestinal societies released recommendations for Endoscopy Units to reduce the risk of the contagion. However, there are few data from high-prevalence areas on adherence to these recommendations and on their efficacy. METHODS: A survey was designed by the Lombardy section of SIED to analyze (a) changes in activity and organization, (b) adherence to recommendations, (c) rate of health care professionals' (HCP) infection during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: In total, 35/61 invited centers (57.4%) participated; most modified activities were according to recommendations and had filtering face piece 2/filtering face piece 3 and water-repellent gowns available, but few had negative-pressure rooms or provided telephonic follow-up; 15% of HCPs called in sick and 6% had confirmed COVID-19. There was a trend (P=0.07) toward different confirmed COVID-19 rates among endoscopists (7.9%), nurses (6.6%), intermediate-care technicians (3.4%), and administrative personnel (2.2%). There was no correlation between the rate of sick HCPs and COVID-19 incidence in the provinces and personal protective equipment availability and use, whereas an inverse correlation with hospital volume was found. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to recommendations was rather good, though a minority were able to follow all recommendations. Confirmed COVID-19 seemed higher among endoscopists and nurses, suggesting that activities in the endoscopy rooms are at considerable viral spread risk.","Capurso, Gabriele; Archibugi, Livia; Vanella, Giuseppe; Testoni, Sabrina G G; Petrone, Maria C; Fanti, Lorella; Greco, Salvatore; Cavenati, Sergio; Gaffuri, Nicola; Lella, Fausto; Pace, Fabio; Cengia, Gianpaolo; Spada, Cristiano; Lovera, Mauro; Missale, Guido; Rosato, Stenio; Radaelli, Franco; Buscarini, Elisabetta; Parente, Fabrizio; Pilati, Stefano; Luigiano, Carmelo; Passoni, Giovanni R; Salerno, Raffaele; Bargiggia, Stefano; Penagini, Roberto; Cantù, Paolo; Fregoni, Fiorenza; Giannetti, Aurora; Devani, Massimo; Manes, Gianpiero; Fiori, Giancarla; Fontana, Paola; Gambitta, Pietro; Masci, Enzo; Mutignani, Massimiliano; Gatti, Mario; Canani, Marcella B; Vailati, Cristian; Dinelli, Marco Emilio; Marzo, Vincenza; Alvisi, Costanza; Caramia, Vitantonio; Di Sabatino, Antonio; Mauro, Aurelio; De Grazia, Federico; Balzarini, Marco; Segato, Sergio; Nella, Giovanni A; Giannini, Patrizia; Leoni, Piera",J. clin. gastroenterol,669,1

Acoustic micrographs obtained at 420 MHz clearly resolve the weld lines with morphological deformations and microelastic heterogenity. This is also where terahertz (THz) measurements, carried out in support of the SAM study, reveal enhanced birefringence corresponding to the location of these lines enabling verification of the SAM results. Rayleigh surface acoustic waves (RSAW), quantified by V(z) curves (with defocusing distance of 85 µm), are found to propagate slower in regions close to the weld lines than in regions distant from these lines. The discrepancy of about 100 m/s in the velocity of RSAW indicates a large variation in the micro-elastic properties between areas close to and distant from the weld lines. The spatial variations in velocity (VR) of RSAWs indicate anisotropic propagation of the differently polarized ultrasonic waves.","Ahmed Mohamed, Esam T; Zhai, Min; Schneider, G; Kalmar, R; Fendler, M; Locquet, Alexandre; Citrin, D S; Declercq, N F",Micron,669,24

Remdesivir has got FDA approval as the first COVID-19 anti-viral agent in adult and paediatric patients (aged ≥12 years and weighing at least 40 kg) requiring hospitalization. Objective: The present prospective, observational, cross sectional study was planned to evaluate the impact of early initiation of Remdesivir on clinical outcomes in moderate to severe COVID 19 patients requiring ICU care. Materials and Methods: In this study, 100 consecutive symptomatic RT-PCR positive COVID 19 patients requiring admission to Intensive care unit based on predefined criteria were included for evaluation. All such moderate to severely ill patients were given Remdesivir intravenously as a 200-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by a 100-mg maintenance dose for the next four days along with other standard care. The main outcome measure analysed was the impact of early initiation of Remdesivir on recovery assessed by number of days in hospital, recovery, biochemical improvements and death. Results: Out of total 100 patients, 84 patients recovered with Remdesivir along with supportive treatment and were discharged from the hospital. Mean age of patients at presentation 53.5± 14.8 years with 5:1 male preponderance. Mean duration of hospital stay was 11.6 ± 5.9 days. D-dimer, CRP, Ferritin, IL-6 decreased significantly post treatment with P values <0.05, <0.001, <0.001, <0.01 respectively when compared to values at admission. No significant side effects were seen with remdesivir infusion. Conclusion: This real-world experience suggests that in the subset of hospitalized patients with moderate to severe pneumonia, early use of Remdesivir can lead to better clinical outcomes and help in reduction of associated mortality and morbidity of COVID-19. © 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

Inspired by the ability, a circulated air curtain composed of end-to-end plane jets generated by a relay of air pillars is proposed to confine exhaled contaminants in this study. Furthermore, the optimization study of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is conducted to explore cutting-off performance and find better design parameters under different conditions, i.e., human-curtain distance, enclosure shape, jet velocity from air pillar, and exhalation modes. The multidirectional blockage and vortex-like rotative transmission routes of exhaled airflow are observed when air curtain exists. Results indicate that contaminants are concentrated around the source. The average mole fraction of exhaled contaminants outside air curtain under different human-curtain distance decreases 4.3%-19.6% compared to mixing ventilation with same flux. Shortening the human-curtain distance can improve the performance of air curtain and may change the direction of exhaled airflow. Moreover, It has better performance when the enclosure shape is close to a circle. Higher jet velocity is better for improving the confinement performance, but the trend is not very obvious as velocity increases. For exhalation modes, it is more challenging to control exhaled contaminants for intense exhalation activity (such as coughing) in steady simulation, but results in transient simulation show better performance when coughing only once. These results can provide a reference for the subsequent design and improvement in applying air curtain in hospital wards or other places, especially during the period of flu outbreak.

The Lombardy region reported the highest COVID-19 crude mortality rate (141.0 x 100,000) 70-days after the onset of the epidemic, followed by the Community of Madrid (132.8 x 100,000) New York State (120.7 x 100,000). The large variation in COVID-19 mortality and case-fatality rates for COVID-19 in different age strata suggested a more accurate analysis and interpretation of the epidemic dynamics after standardization of the rates by age. The share of elder populations (>70 years) over total population varies widely in the considered study settings, ranging from 6.9% in Catalonia to 17.0% in Lombardy. When taking age distribution into consideration the highest standardized mortality rate was observed in the State of New York (257.9 x 100,000); with figures in most of the European regions concentrated between 123.3 x 100,000 in Greater London and 177.7 x 100,000 in Bruxelles-Capital, lower in French and Danish regions. We also report and critical appraise, when available, COVID-19 mortality figures in capital cities, nursing homes, as well as excess mortality at country level.

The title compound in centrosymmetric space group Cmcm contains dimers of two ScO6 octahedra sharing corners with three bridging WO4 tetrahedra. Three pairs of opposite terminal WO4 tetrahedra are additionally linked by AgO2 dumbbells to form {Ag3[Sc2(WO4)9]}9- groups, which together with some rubidium ions are packed in pseudohexagonal glaserite-like layers parallel to (001), but stacking of the layers is different in these three structures. In the title structure, the layers stack with a shift along the b axis and their interlayer space contains disordered Rb+ cations partially substituted by Ag+ ions. Almost linear chains of incompletely filled close Rb3a-Rb3d positions (the shortest distances Rb-Rb are 0.46 to 0.64â Å) are found to locate approximately along the b axis.

The impact of the pandemic and the consequent lockdown on medical emergencies other than those SARS-CoV 2 pandemic related is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiologic impact of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on hospital admission for severe emergent cardiovascular diseases (SECDs) in a single Northern Italy large tertiary referral center. Methods and Results We quantified SECDs admissions to the Cardiology Division of Udine University Hospital between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2020 and compared them with those of the same time frame during 2019. Compared with March 2019, we observed a significant reduction in all SECDs admissions: -30% for ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndromes, -66% for non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndromes and -50% for severe bradyarrhythmia. Conclusions A significant decrease in all SECDs admissions has been observed during the SARS-CoV 2. pandemic and was unlikely caused by a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Fear of contagion may have contributed to the unpredictable drop of SECDs. Social education about early recognition of symptoms of life-threatening cardiac conditions requiring appropriate care in a timely fashion may help to reduce this counterproductive phenomenon.","Toniolo, Mauro; Negri, Francesco; Antonutti, Marco; Masè, Marco; Facchin, Domenico",J Am Heart Assoc,669,1

Here, the architecture's performance and characteristics are evaluated in comparison with the dynamic factor model (DFM), currently a popular choice in the field of economic nowcasting. LSTMs are found to produce superior results to DFMs in the nowcasting of three separate variables; global merchandise export values and volumes, and global services exports. Further advantages include their ability to handle large numbers of input features in a variety of time frequencies. A disadvantage is the inability to ascribe contributions of input features to model outputs, common to all ANNs.

However, most patients included in those studies underwent polysomnography because of symptoms, so the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in this population is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in children with myelomeningocele using screening polysomnography. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, all children with myelomeningocele seen in a multi-disciplinary spina bifida clinic between 2016 and 2020 were referred for polysomnography regardless of clinical symptoms. Included children had not previously undergone polysomnography. The primary outcome for this study was presence of sleep disordered breathing, defined as Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI, number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour of sleep) greater than 2.5. Clinical and demographic variables relevant to myelomeningocele were also prospectively collected and tested for association with presence of sleep apnea. RESULTS: A total of 117 participants underwent polysomnography (age 1 mo to 21 yr, 49% male). The majority were white, non-Hispanic. Median AHI was 1.9 (interquartile range 0.6-4.2). A total of 49 children had AHI 2.5 or greater, yielding a sleep disordered breathing prevalence of 42% (95% CI 33%-51%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, children with more rostral neurological lesion levels had higher odds of sleep disordered breathing (OR for thoracic, mid-lumbar, and low-lumbar: 7.34, 3.70, 4.04, respectively, compared to sacral level, P = .043). CONCLUSION: Over 40% of a sample of children with myelomeningocele, who underwent screening polysomnography, had significant sleep disordered breathing.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to investigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the school setting. MethodsLiterature searches from April, 2021 and repeated on May, 15th 2021 yielded a total of 1088 publications: screening, contact tracing and seroprevalence studies. MOOSE guidelines were followed and data analyzed using random-effects models. ResultsFrom screening studies involving more than 120,000 subjects, we estimated 0.31% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.05-0.81%) SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence in schools. Contact tracing studies, involving a total of 112,622 contacts of children and adults, showed that onward viral transmission was limited (2.54%; 95%CI 0.76-5.31). Young index cases were found to be 74% significantly less likely than adults to favor viral spread (Odds Ratio [OR]=0.26; 95%CI 0.11-0.63) and were less susceptible to infection (OR=0.60; 95% CI 0.25-1.47). Finally, from seroprevalence studies, with a total of 17,879 subjects involved, we estimated that children are 43% significantly less likely than adults to test positive for antibodies (OR=0.57; 95%CI: 0.49-0.68). In conclusion, testing all subjects in schools, independently of symptoms, students less likely than adults favor viral spread and SARS-CoV-2 circulation in schools was found to be limited.

Dromedary camels are the source of zoonotic infection. Over 70% of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-infected dromedaries are found in Africa but no zoonotic disease has been reported in Africa. We aimed to understand whether individuals with exposure to dromedaries in Africa had been infected by MERS-CoV. METHODS: Workers slaughtering dromedaries in an abattoir in Kano, Nigeria, were compared with abattoir workers without direct dromedary contact, non-abattoir workers from Kano, and controls from Guangzhou, China. Exposure to dromedaries was ascertained using a questionnaire. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were tested for MERS-CoV specific neutralising antibody and T-cell responses. FINDINGS: None of the participants from Nigeria or Guangdong were MERS-CoV seropositive. 18 (30%) of 61 abattoir workers with exposure to dromedaries, but none of 20 abattoir workers without exposure (p=0·0042), ten non-abattoir workers or 24 controls from Guangzhou (p=0·0002) had evidence of MERS-CoV-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in PBMC. T-cell responses to other endemic human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, HKU-1, and NL-63) were observed in all groups with no association with dromedary exposure. Drinking both unpasteurised camel milk and camel urine was significantly and negatively associated with T-cell positivity (odds ratio 0·07, 95% CI 0·01-0·54). INTERPRETATION: Zoonotic infection of dromedary-exposed individuals is taking place in Nigeria and suggests that the extent of MERS-CoV infections in Africa is underestimated. MERS-CoV could therefore adapt to human transmission in Africa rather than the Arabian Peninsula, where attention is currently focused.

The exactly mechanism of such hypoxemia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not well described. It has been suggested that microthrombosis contributes to this mechanism, increasing pulmonary dead space. However, dead spaces would not be sensible to oxygen supplementation, and also, enlargement of pulmonary vessels it has been evidenced. Shunt mechanism by vasodilatation, instead, could explain decubitus dependence in oxygenation by blood redistribution as observed in these patients, and moreover, would be more sensible to oxygen supplementation than dead spaces. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 causes an intrapulmonary vascular dilatation (IPVD), determining a shunt mechanism by vasodilatation. We performed contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography to search IPVD shunt in patients with confirmed COVID-19, hospitalized in an intensive care unit. Ten patients were recruited; one patient was excluded due to low quality of echocardiographic image, and nine patients were included. IPVD was found in seven (78%) patients, with different grades, including patient with normal compliance and the one without invasive ventilation. We demonstrated that shunt by IPVD is present among patients with COVID-19, and this mechanism is probably implicated in significant hypoxemia observed.","Brito-Azevedo, Anderson; Pinto, Eduardo Costa; de Cata Preta Corrêa, Gabriel Angelo; Bouskela, Eliete",J. med. virol,669,21

X-ray machines are widely available worldwide and can quickly provide images that can be used for diagnosis.

This paper explores the robustness and generalization ability of convolutional neural network models in diagnosing Covid-19 disease from frontal-view (AP/PA), raw chest X-ray images that were lung field cropped. Some concerning observations are made about high performing models that have learned to rely on confounding features related to the data source, rather than the patient's lung pathology, when differentiating between Covid-19 positive and negative labels. Specifically, these models likely made diagnoses based on confounding factors such as patient age or image processing artifacts, rather than medically relevant information.","Ahmed, Kaoutar Ben; Hall, Lawrence O.; Goldgof, Dmitry B.; Goldgof, Gregory M.; Paul, Rahul",,669,16

Emerging COVID-19 infection, caused by the novel SARS-CoV2, is now a pandemic, bringing a substantial burden to human health. Interferon (IFN), combined with other antivirals and various treatments, has been used to treat and prevent MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 infections. We aimed to assess the clinical efficacy of IFN-based treatments and combinational therapy with antivirals, corticosteroids, traditional medicine, and other treatments. Major healthcare databases and grey literature were investigated. A three-stage screening was utilized, and included studies were checked against the protocol eligibility criteria. Risk of bias assessment and data extraction were performed, followed by narrative data synthesis. Fifty-five distinct studies of SARS-CoV2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV were spotted. Our narrative synthesis showed a possible benefit in the use of IFN. A good quality cohort showed lower CRP levels in Arbidol (ARB) + IFN group vs. IFN only group. Another study reported a significantly shorter chest X-ray (CXR) resolution in IFN-Alfacon-1 + corticosteroid group compared with the corticosteroid only group in SARS-CoV patients. In a COVID-19 trial, total adverse drug events (ADEs) were much lower in the Favipiravir (FPV) + IFN-&#945; group compared with the LPV/RTV arm (P = 0.001). Also, nausea in patients receiving FPV + IFN-&#945; regimen was significantly lower (P = 0.03). Quantitative analysis of mortality did not show a conclusive effect for IFN/RBV treatment in six moderately heterogeneous MERS-CoV studies (log OR = -0.05, 95% CI: (-0.71,0.62), I2 = 44.71%). A meta-analysis of three COVID-19 studies did not show a conclusive nor meaningful relation between receiving IFN and COVID-19 severity (log OR = -0.44, 95% CI: (-1.13,0.25), I2 = 31.42%). A lack of high-quality cohorts and controlled trials was observed. Evidence suggests the potential efficacy of several combination IFN therapies such as lower ADEs, quicker resolution of CXR, or a decrease in inflammatory cytokines; Still, these options must possibly be further explored before being recommended in public guidelines. For all major CoVs, our results may indicate a lack of a definitive effect of IFN treatment on mortality. We recommend such therapeutics be administered with extreme caution until further investigation uncovers high-quality evidence in favor of IFN or combination therapy with IFN.","Saleki, Kiarash; Yaribash, Shakila; Banazadeh, Mohammad; Hajihosseinlou, Ehsan; Gouravani, Mahdi; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Eur J Pharmacol,669,24

In this study, the occurrence and distribution of five categories of DBPs, including six trihalomethanes (THMs), nine haloacetic acids (HAAs), two haloketones, nine nitrosamines, and nine aromatic halogenated DBPs, in domestic wastewater effluent, tap water, and surface water were investigated. The results showed that the total concentration level of measured DBPs in wastewater effluents (78.3 µg/L) was higher than that in tap water (56.0 µg/L, p = 0.05), followed by surface water (8.0 µg/L, p < 0.01). Moreover, HAAs and THMs were the two most dominant categories of DBPs in wastewater effluents, tap water, and surface water, accounting for >90%, respectively. Out of the regulated DBPs, none of the wastewater effluents and tap water samples exceeded the corresponding maximum guideline values of chloroform (300 µg/L), THM4 (80 µg/L), NDMA (100 ng/L), and only 2 of 35 tap water samples (67.6 and 63.3 µg/L) exceeded the HAA5 (60 µg/L) safe limit. HAAs in wastewater effluents showed higher values of risk quotient for green algae. This study illustrates that the elevated use of disinfectants within the guidance ranges during water disinfection did not result in a significant increase in the concentration of DBPs.","Li, Zhigang; Song, Gaofei; Bi, Yonghong; Gao, Wei; He, Anen; Lu, Yao; Wang, Yawei; Jiang, Guibin",Environ. sci. technol,669,16

In this paper, we explore how governments can fulfill an important need as suppliers of liquidity. Building on the financing advantage view of state ownership, we theorize how state-owned enterprises (SOEs) may provide capital by offering trade credit to customer firms. The data indicate a positive relation between the level of state ownership and the provision of trade credit. Using an institution-focused framework, we further determine that the nation's institutional environment systematically affects the opportunities and motivations for SOEs to grant trade credit. Specifically, we find that SOEs grant more trade credit in countries with less developed financial markets, weaker legal protection of creditors, less comprehensive information-sharing mechanisms, more collectivist societies, left-wing governments, and higher levels of unemployment. Firm-level factors also influence the credit-granting decisions of SOEs, with SOEs with lower levels of state ownership and higher extents of internationalization offering lower amounts of trade credit. Overall, our study offers novel insights regarding the important role of state-owned firms as providers of liquidity.","Chen, Ruiyuan; El Ghoul, Sadok; Guedhami, Omrane; Kwok, Chuck C Y; Nash, Robert",J Int Bus Stud,669,16

The importation of the cases owing to enormous international travels from the affected countries is the foremost reason for local cycle of transmission. For a country like India, the second most populous country in the world with ~ 1.35 billion population, the management and control of 2019-nCoV domestic spread heavily relied on effective screening and strict quarantine of passengers arriving at various international airports in India from affected countries. Here, by extracting the data from FLIRT, an online airline database for more than 800 airlines, and scanning more than 180,000 flights and 39.9 million corresponding passenger seats during 4th - 25th March, we show that India experienced the highest risk index of importing the passengers from middle eastern airports. Contrary to perception, travelers from China imposed lowest risk of importing the infected cases in India. This is clearly evident form the fact that while the number of infected cases were on the peak in China India was one of the least affected countries. The number of cases in India started exhibiting a sharp increase in the infected cases only after the European countries and USA recorded large number of infected cases. We further argue that while the number of cases in middle eastern countries may still be very low, the airports in middle eastern countries, particularly Dubai, being one of the largest transit hubs for international passengers, including arriving in India, might have posed a higher risk of getting infected with 2019-nCoV. We suggest that any future travel related disease infection screening at the airports should critically assess the passengers from major transit hubs in addition to affected country of origin.","Gunthe, Sachin S; Patra, Satya S",Global Health,669,10

A one-step RT-ddPCR multiplex assay was developed for simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 E, RdRp and N viral RNA, and human Rpp30 DNA and GUSB mRNA, for internal nucleic acid (NA) extraction and RT-PCR control. Dilution series of viral RNA transcripts were prepared in water and total NA extract of Covid-19-negative patients. As reference assay, an E-GUSB duplex RT-PCR was used. GUSB mRNA detection was used to set validity criteria to assure viral RNA and RT-PCR assay quality and to enable quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In a background of at least 100 GUSB mRNA copies, 5 copies of viral RNA are reliably detectable and 10 copies viral RNA copies are reliably quantifiable. It was found that assay sensitivity of the RT-ddPCR was not affected by the total NA background while assay sensitivity of the gold standard RT-PCR assay is drastically decreased when SARS-CoV-2 copies were detected in a background of total NA extract compared with water. The present study describes a robust and sensitive one-step ddRT-PCR multiplex assay for reliable quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. By determining the fractional abundance of viral RNA with respect to a human housekeeping gene, viral loads from different samples can be compared, what could be used to investigate the infectiveness and to monitor Covid-19 patients.","de Kock, Remco; Baselmans, Mieke; Scharnhorst, Volkher; Deiman, Birgit",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,669,16

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data records of 50 patients with COVID-19 who were evaluated by the neurology services from March 1, 2020 - April 30, 2020. Patients were categorized into 2 groups based on timing of developing neurological manifestations: the ""Neuro first"" group had neurological manifestations upon initial assessment, and the ""COVID first"" group developed neurological symptoms greater than 24 h after hospitalization. The demographics, comorbidities, disease severity and neurological symptoms and diagnoses of both groups were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients (48% African American and 24% Latino) were included in the analysis. Most common neurological manifestations observed were encephalopathy (n = 30), cerebrovascular disease (n = 20), cognitive impairment (n = 13), seizures (n = 13), hypoxic brain injury (n = 7), dysgeusia (n = 5), and extraocular movement abnormalities (n = 5).

However, we report the following new findings from the variants: (1) Residues GLY15, VAL157, and PRO184 have mutated more than once in SARS CoV-2; (2) the D48E variant has lead to a novel ""TSEEMLN"""" loop at the binding pocket; (3) inactive apo Mpro does not show signs of dissociation in 100 ns MD; (4) a non-canonical pose for PHE140 widens the substrate binding surface; (5) dual allosteric pockets coinciding with various stabilizing and functional components of the substrate binding pocket were found to display correlated compaction dynamics; (6) high betweenness centrality values for residues 17 and 128 in all Mpro samples suggest their high importance in dimer stability-one such consequence has been observed for the M17I mutation whereby one of the N-fingers was highly unstable. (7) Independent coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations suggest a relationship between the rigidity/mutability and enzymatic function. Our entire approach combining database preparation, variant retrieval, homology modeling, dynamic residue network (DRN), relevant conformation retrieval from 1-D kernel density estimates from reaction coordinates to other existing approaches of structural analysis, and data visualization within the coronaviral Mpro is also novel and is applicable to other coronaviral proteins.","Sheik Amamuddy, Olivier; Verkhivker, Gennady M; Tastan Bishop, Özlem",,669,24

The current study aims to investigate and analyze the people top concerns and sentiment dynamics expressed in physician online reviews (PORs). (2) Methods: Text data were collected from four U.S.-based PRWs during the three time periods of 2018, 2019 and 2020. Based on the dynamic topic modeling, hot topics related to different aspects of healthcare were identified. Following the hybrid approach of aspect-based sentiment analysis, the social network of prevailing topics was also analyzed whether people expressed positive, neutral or negative sentiments in PORs. (3) Results: The study identified 30 dominant topics across three different stages which lead toward four key findings. First, topics discussed in Stage III were quite different from the earlier two stages due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Second, based on the keyword co-occurrence analysis, the most prevalent keywords in all three stages were related to the treatment, questions asked by patients, communication problem, patients' feelings toward the hospital environment, disease symptoms, time spend with patients and different issues related to the COVID-19 (i.e., pneumonia, death, spread and cases). Third, topics related to the provider service quality, hospital servicescape and treatment cost were the most dominant topics in Stages I and II, while the quality of online information regarding COVID-19 and government countermeasures were the most dominant topics in Stage III. Fourth, when zooming into the topic-based sentiments analysis, hot topics in Stage I were mostly positive (joy be the dominant emotion), then negative (disgust be the dominant emotion) in Stage II. Furthermore, sentiments in the initial period of Stage III (COVID-19) were negative (anger be the dominant emotion), then transformed into positive (trust be the dominant emotion) later. The findings also revealed that the proposed method outperformed the conventional machine learning models in analyzing topic and sentiment dynamics expressed in PRWs. (4) Conclusions: Methodologically, this research demonstrates the ability and importance of computational techniques for analyzing large corpora of text and complementing conventional social science approaches.","Shah, Adnan Muhammad; Naqvi, Rizwan Ali; Jeong, Ok-Ran",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),669,26

RT-PCR data are traditionally analyzed by estimating the threshold cycle (CT ) at which the fluorescence signal produced by emission of a probe crosses a baseline level. Current models used to estimate the CT value are based on approximations that do not adequately account for the stochastic variations of the fluorescence signal that is detected during RT-PCR. Less common deviations become more apparent as the sample size increases, as is the case in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this work, we employ a method independent of CT value to interpret RT-PCR data. In this novel approach, we built and trained a deep learning model, qPCRdeepNet, to analyze the fluorescent readings obtained during RT-PCR. We describe how this model can be deployed as a quality assurance tool to monitor result interpretation in real time. The model's performance with the TaqPath COVID19 Combo Kit assay, widely used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, is described. This model can be applied broadly for the primary interpretation of RT-PCR assays and potentially replace the CT interpretive paradigm.","Alouani, David J; Rajapaksha, Roshani R P; Jani, Mehul; Rhoads, Daniel D; Sadri, Navid",J. clin. microbiol,669,6

Nepalese people are rich in traditional medicine especially in folk medicine (ethnomedicine), and this system is gaining much attention after 1995. The use of medicinal plants has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as a private behavior (not under the control of government). A lot of misinterpretations of the use of medicinal plants to treat or prevent COVID-19 have been spreading throughout Nepal which need to be managed proactively. In this context, a research was needed to document medicinal plants used, their priority of use in society, their cultivation status, and the source of information people follow to use them. This study aimed to document the present status of medicinal plant use and make important suggestion to the concerned authorities. METHODS: This study used a web-based survey to collect primary data related to medicinal plants used during COVID-19. A total of 774 respondents took part in the survey. The study calculated the relative frequencies of citation (RFC) for the recorded medicinal plants. The relationship between plants recorded and different covariates (age, gender education, occupation, living place, and treatment methods) was assessed using Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon test. The relationship between the information sources people follow and the respondent characteristics was assessed using chi-square test. RESULTS: The study found that the use of medicinal plants has increased during COVID-19 and most of the respondents recommended medicinal plants to prevent COVID-19. This study recorded a total of 60 plants belonging to 36 families. The leaves of the plants were the most frequently used. The Zingiber officinale was the most cited species with the frequency of citation 0.398. Most of the people (45.61%) were getting medicinal plants from their home garden. The medicinal plants recorded were significantly associated with the education level, location of home, primary treatment mode, gender, and age class. The information source of plants was significantly associated with the education, gender, method of treatment, occupation, living with family, and location of home during the lockdown caused by COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: People were using more medicinal plants during COVID-19 claiming that they can prevent or cure COVID-19. This should be taken seriously by concerned authorities. The authorities should test the validity of these medicinal plants and control the flow of false information spread through research and awareness programs.","Khadka, Dipak; Dhamala, Man Kumar; Li, Feifei; Aryal, Prakash Chandra; Magar, Pappu Rana; Bhatta, Sijar; Thakur, Manju Shree; Basnet, Anup; Cui, Dafang; Shi, Shi",J Ethnobiol Ethnomed,669,16

However, the underlying biological mechanisms of how prenatal PM2.5 exposure affects the lungs are incompletely understood, which explains the lack of an ideal in vitro lung development model. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been successfully employed for in vitro developmental toxicity evaluations due to their unique ability to differentiate into any type of cell in the body. In this study, we investigated the developmental toxicity of diesel fine PM (dPM2.5) exposure during hPSC-derived alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) differentiation and three-dimensional (3D) multicellular alveolar organoid (AO) development. We found that dPM2.5 (50 and 100 µg/mL) treatment disturbed the AEC differentiation, accompanied by upregulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases and inflammation. Exposure to dPM2.5 also promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during AEC and AO development via activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling, while dPM2.5 had no effect on surfactant protein C expression in hPSC-derived AECs. Notably, we provided evidence, for the first time, that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a receptor to mediate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus clade 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry into target cells, and the cofactor transmembrane protease serine 2 were significantly upregulated in both hPSC-AECs and AOs treated with dPM2.5. In conclusion, we demonstrated the potential alveolar development toxicity and the increase of SARS-Cov-2 susceptibility of PM2.5. Our findings suggest that an hPSC-based 2D and 3D alveolar induction system could be a useful in vitro platform for evaluating the adverse effects of environmental toxins and for virus research.","Kim, Jung-Hyun; Kim, Jeeyoung; Kim, Woo Jin; Choi, Yung Hyun; Yang, Se-Ran; Hong, Seok-Ho",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),669,26

Short of a truly effective preventive or curative vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it is becoming increasingly clear that multiple pathophysiologic processes seen with COVID-19 as well as SARS-CoV-2 itself should be targeted. Because alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) embraces a panoply of biologic activities that may antagonize several pathophysiologic mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize that this naturally occurring molecule is a promising agent to ameliorate COVID-19. We posit at least seven different mechanisms by which AAT may alleviate COVID-19. First, AAT is a serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) shown to inhibit TMPRSS-2, the host serine protease that cleaves the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a necessary preparatory step for the virus to bind its cell surface receptor ACE2 to gain intracellular entry. Second, AAT has anti-viral activity against other RNA viruses HIV and influenza as well as induces autophagy, a known host effector mechanism against MERS-CoV, a related coronavirus that causes the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Third, AAT has potent anti-inflammatory properties, in part through inhibiting both nuclear factor-kappa B (NF&#954;B) activation and ADAM17 (also known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme), and thus may dampen the hyper-inflammatory response of COVID-19. Fourth, AAT inhibits neutrophil elastase, a serine protease that helps recruit potentially injurious neutrophils and implicated in acute lung injury. AAT inhibition of ADAM17 also prevents shedding of ACE2 and hence may preserve ACE2 inhibition of bradykinin, reducing the ability of bradykinin to cause a capillary leak in COVID-19. Fifth, AAT inhibits thrombin, and venous thromboembolism and in situ microthrombi and macrothrombi are increasingly implicated in COVID-19. Sixth, AAT inhibition of elastase can antagonize the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a complex extracellular structure comprised of neutrophil-derived DNA, histones, and proteases, and implicated in the immunothrombosis of COVID-19; indeed, AAT has been shown to change the shape and adherence of non-COVID-19-related NETs. Seventh, AAT inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis may limit the endothelial injury linked to severe COVID-19-associated acute lung injury, multi-organ dysfunction, and pre-eclampsia-like syndrome seen in gravid women. Furthermore, because both NETs formation and the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies are increased in both COVID-19 and non-COVID pre-eclampsia, it suggests a similar vascular pathogenesis in both disorders. As a final point, AAT has an excellent safety profile when administered to patients with AAT deficiency and is dosed intravenously once weekly but also comes in an inhaled preparation. Thus, AAT is an appealing drug candidate to treat COVID-19 and should be studied.","Bai, Xiyuan; Hippensteel, Joseph; Leavitt, Alida; Maloney, James P; Beckham, David; Garcia, Cindy; Li, Qing; Freed, Brian M; Ordway, Diane; Sandhaus, Robert A; Chan, Edward D",Med Hypotheses,669,16

From a review of a limited number of studies, the common methods for forecasting tour traffic demand appear to be regression analysis, econometric modeling, time-series modeling, artificial neural networks, and gray theory. In this study, a two-step procedure is used to build a predictive model for public transport. In the first step of this study, regression analysis is used to find the correlations between two or more variables and their associated directions and strength, and the regression function is used to predict future changes. In the second step, the regression analysis and artificial neural network methods are assessed and the results are compared. The artificial neural network is more accurate in prediction than regression analysis. The study results can provide useful references for transportation organizations in the development of business operation strategies for managing sustainable smart cities.","Chen, Y. S.; Lin, C.

Although pregnancy may be a risk factor in respiratory virus infections, there are no considerable differences regarding COVID-19 severity observed between pregnant and nonpregnant women. In these circumstances, an emergent concern is the possibility of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric harm for the offspring of infected mothers. Currently, there is no stronger evidence indicating vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, the exacerbated inflammatory response observed in the disease could lead to several impairments in the offspring's brain.

Given the rapid acceleration of new cases and the common sense of global urgency, COVID-19 is subject to thorough measurement on a country-by-country basis. The world is witnessing an increasing demand for reliable data and impactful information on the novel disease. Can we trust the data on the COVID-19 spread worldwide? This study aims to assess the reliability of COVID-19 global data as disclosed by local authorities in 202 countries. It is commonly accepted that the frequency distribution of leading digits of COVID-19 data shall comply with Benford's law. In this context, the author collected and statistically assessed 106,274 records of daily infections, deaths, and tests around the world. The analysis of worldwide data suggests good agreement between theory and reported incidents. Approximately 69% of countries worldwide show some deviations from Benford's law. The author found that records of daily infections, deaths, and tests from 28% of countries adhered well to the anticipated frequency of first digits. By contrast, six countries disclosed pandemic data that do not comply with the first-digit law. With over 82 million citizens, Germany publishes the most reliable records on the COVID-19 spread. In contrast, the Islamic Republic of Iran provides by far the most non-compliant data. The author concludes that inconsistencies with Benford's law might be a strong indicator of artificially fabricated data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by local authorities. Partially consistent with prior research, the United States, Germany, France, Australia, Japan, and China reveal data that satisfies Benford's law. Unification of reporting procedures and policies globally could improve the quality of data and thus the fight against the deadly virus.","Farhadi, Noah",Sci Prog,669,16

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine whether posterior lumbar interbody fusion with cortical bone trajectory screw fixation (CBT-PLIF) is inferior to PLIF using traditional trajectory screw fixation (TT-PLIF) regarding early fusion status and whether the titanium-coated polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage (TP cage) improves early fusion status compared with the same shape pure PEEK cage (P cage). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: We recently reported that the fusion rate was relatively lower after CBT-PLIF than after TT-PLIF, although no significant difference was found and that compared with the carbon PEEK cage, the TP cage significantly reduced the incidence of vertebral endplate cysts (cyst signs) and slightly improved the early fusion rate at 1 year after CBT-PLIF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjects were 37 patients undergoing TT-PLIF using P cages (TT-P group), 24 patients undergoing CBT-PLIF using P cages (CBT-P group), 32 patients undergoing TT-PLIF using TP cages (TT-TP group), and 20 patients undergoing CBT-PLIF using TP cages (CBT-TP group). On multiplanar reconstruction computed tomography at 6 months after surgery, cyst signs were evaluated and classified into diffuse or local cysts. Early fusion status was assessed using both dynamic plain radiographs and multiplanar reconstruction computed tomography at 1-year postoperatively. RESULTS: The incidence of the diffuse cyst was 27.0% in the TT-P group, 29.2% in the CBT-P group, 25.0% in the TT-TP group and 25.0% in the CBT-TP group (P>0.05). The early fusion rate was 75.7% in the TT-P group, 75.0% in the CBT-P group, 71.9% in the TT-TP group and 75.0% in the CBT-TP group (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CBT-PLIF resulted in the equivalent early fusion status to TT-PLIF and that compared with the same shape P cage, the TP cage did not improve early fusion status after both TT-PLIF and CBT-PLIF.","Sakaura, Hironobu; Ikegami, Daisuke; Fujimori, Takahito; Sugiura, Tsuyoshi; Mukai, Yoshihiro",Clin. spine surg.

In this qualitative study, we examined the patterns of adherence to mitigation measures and reasons underpinning these behaviors. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 participants from BAME and low-income White backgrounds. The topic guide was designed to explore how individuals are adhering to social distancing and self-isolation during the pandemic and to explore the reasons underpinning this behavior. RESULTS: We identified three categories of adherence to lockdown measures: (i) caution-motivated super-adherence (ii) risk-adapted partial-adherence and (iii) necessity-driven partial-adherence. Decisions about adherence considered potential for exposure to the virus, ability to reduce risk through use of protective measures and perceived importance of/need for the behavior. CONCLUSIONS: This research highlights a need for a more nuanced understanding of adherence to lockdown measures. Provision of practical and financial support could reduce the number of people who have to engage in necessity-driven partial-adherence.

Several viral proteins domain swap to increase their structural complexity or functional avidity. The main protease (Mpro) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus proteolyzes viral polyproteins and has been a target for anti-SARS drug design. Domain swapping in the &#945;-helical C-terminal domain of Mpro (MproC) locks Mpro into a hyperactive octameric form that is hypothesized to promote the early stages of viral replication. However, in the absence of a complete molecular understanding of the mechanism of domain swapping, investigations into the biological relevance of this octameric Mpro have stalled. Isolated MproC can exist as a monomer or a domain-swapped dimer. Here, we investigate the mechanism of domain swapping of MproC using coarse-grained structure-based models and molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations recapitulate several experimental features of MproC folding. Further, we find that a contact between a tryptophan in the MproC domain-swapping hinge and an arginine elsewhere forms early during folding, modulates the folding route, and promotes domain swapping to the native structure. An examination of the sequence and the structure of the tryptophan containing hinge loop shows that it has a propensity to form multiple secondary structures and contacts, indicating that it could be stabilized into either the monomer- or dimer-promoting conformations by mutations or ligand binding. Finally, because all residues in the tryptophan loop are identical in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, mutations that modulate domain swapping may provide insights into the role of octameric Mpro in the early-stage viral replication of both viruses.","Terse, Vishram L; Gosavi, Shachi",Biophys J,669,26

It is crucial we understand the epidemiological trends and impact of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs), such as lockdowns for effective management of the disease and control of its spread. We develop and validate a novel intelligent computational model to predict epidemiological trends of COVID-19, with the model parameters enabling an evaluation of the impact of NPIs. By representing the number of daily confirmed cases (NDCC) as a time-series, we assume that, with or without NPIs, the pattern of the pandemic satisfies a series of Gaussian distributions according to the central limit theorem. The underlying pandemic trend is first extracted using a singular spectral analysis (SSA) technique, which decomposes the NDCC time series into the sum of a small number of independent and interpretable components such as a slow varying trend, oscillatory components and structureless noise. We then use a mixture of Gaussian fitting (GF) to derive a novel predictive model for the SSA extracted NDCC incidence trend, with the overall model termed SSA-GF. Our proposed model is shown to accurately predict the NDCC trend, peak daily cases, the length of the pandemic period, the total confirmed cases and the associated dates of the turning points on the cumulated NDCC curve. Further, the three key model parameters, specifically, the amplitude (alpha), mean (mu), and standard deviation (sigma) are linked to the underlying pandemic patterns, and enable a directly interpretable evaluation of the impact of NPIs, such as strict lockdowns and travel restrictions. The predictive model is validated using available data from China and South Korea, and new predictions are made, partially requiring future validation, for the cases of Italy, Spain, the UK and the USA. Comparative results demonstrate that the introduction of consistent control measures across countries can lead to development of similar parametric models, reflected in particular by relative variations in their underlying sigma, alpha and mu values. The paper concludes with a number of open questions and outlines future research directions.","Ren, Jinchang; Yan, Yijun; Zhao, Huimin; Ma, Ping; Zabalza, Jaime; Hussain, Zain; Luo, Shaoming; Dai, Qingyun; Zhao, Sophia; Sheikh, Aziz; Hussain, Amir; Li, Huakang",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,669,24

Impact of nutrition interventions on the outcomes have been scientifically assessed and reported. The role of nutrition in limiting the infection related morbidity and mortality does not appear to be a debatable question but nutrition interventions do not appear to be an essential part of current COVID-19 management strategies. Given the nature of pandemic and lack of organism-specific evidence, variability in nutrition interventions and lack of nutrition interventions is not unexpected. However, delay in realization of the crucial need of nutrition interventions to limit the immediate and long term outcomes at personal and community level may aggravate health related issues that can have long term impact on quality of life and economy. Due to existing undernutrition and lack of nutrition related awareness and competence, need for timely and appropriate interventions is much more critical for developing countries. This manuscript highlights the need and feasibility of various nutrition interventions to assure optimum quality of life during and after COVID-19 pandemic. Available evidence provides enough guidance for nutrition interventions that are safe and promise to accrue various degrees of benefits with almost no likelihood of harm. Nutrition interventions suggested by author are: 1) population level efforts for promoting better use of existing resources; 2) quicker augmentation of nutrition status of high risk people and non-hospitalized cases by use of supplement and individualized guidance and 3) nutritional support of sever case by timely and adequate enteral and parenteral feeding.","Hakeem, Rubina; Sheikh, Muhammad Adil",Pak.

It is vital to know the characteristics of its users in order to be able to meet their needs and understand the coverage of this service in a context where there is reduced accessibility to the health system. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the profile of the citizens who use the eConsulta tool and the reasons for their use, as well as to gain an understanding of the elements that characterize their decision to use it while distinguishing between those who used it before and those who have used it since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A descriptive, observational study based on administrative data was performed. This study differentiates between the COVID-19 pandemic era and the period preceding it, considering the day the state of emergency was declared in Spain (ie, March 12, 2020) as the cut-off point. It also differentiates between eConsulta users who send messages and those who only receive them. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the number of unique users of this teleconsultation service had almost tripled, with up to 33.10 visits per 1000 inhabitants per month reported in the first three months. For the two user profiles analyzed, most users since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak were predominantly female, systematically younger, more actively employed, and with less complex pathologies. Furthermore, eConsulta users received more messages proactively from the health professionals. There was also a relative decrease in the number of conversations initiated by higher-income urban users and an increase in conversations initiated by users in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has helped to generalize the use of telemedicine as a tool to compensate, to some extent, for the decline in face-to-face visits, especially among younger citizens in Catalonia. Telemedicine has made it possible to maintain contact between citizens and the health care system in the context of maximum complexity.","Solans, Oscar; Vidal-Alaball, Josep; Roig Cabo, Pasqual; Mora, Núria; Coma, Ermengol; Bonet Simó, Josep Maria; Hermosilla Pérez, Eduardo; Saigí-Rubió, Francesc; Olmos Domínguez, Carmen; Piera-Jiménez, Jordi; Abizanda González, Mercè; López Seguí, Francesc",J Med Internet Res,669,24

Objective: To provide a pooled estimate of GI symptoms, liver enzyme levels outside reference ranges, and fecal tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 among patients with COVID-19. Data Sources: An electronic literature search was performed for published (using MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase) and preprint (using bioRxiv and medRxiv) studies of interest conducted from November 1, 2019, to March 30, 2020. Search terms included ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS-Cov-2,"" and/or ""novel coronavirus."" Study Selection: Eligible studies were those including patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who reported GI symptoms. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data on patients with GI symptoms (ie, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting), liver enzyme level changes, and fecal shedding of virus were extracted. Quality of studies was examined using methodological index for nonrandomized studies. Pooled estimates (%) were reported with 95% CIs with level of heterogeneity (I2). Main Outcomes and Measures: Study and patient characteristics with pooled detection rates for diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, liver enzyme levels outside reference ranges, and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in feces tests were analyzed. Results: Of 1484 records reviewed, 23 published and 6 preprint studies were included in the analysis, with a total of 4805 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.2 [14.8] years; 1598 [33.2%] women) with COVID-19. The pooled rates were 7.4% (95% CI, 4.3%-12.2%) of patients reporting diarrhea and 4.6% (95% CI, 2.6%-8.0%) of patients reporting nausea or vomiting. The pooled rate for aspartate aminotransferase levels outside reference ranges was 20% (95% CI, 15.3%-25.6%) of patients, and the pooled rate for alanine aminotransferase levels outside reference ranges was 14.6% (95% CI, 12.8%-16.6%) of patients. Fecal tests that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 were reported in 8 studies, and viral RNA shedding was detected in feces in 40.5% (95% CI, 27.4%-55.1%) of patients. There was high level of heterogeneity (I2 = 94%), but no statistically significant publication bias noted. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that that 12% of patients with COVID-19 will manifest GI symptoms; however, SAR-CoV-2 shedding was observed in 40.5% of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. This highlights the need to better understand what measures are needed to prevent further spread of this highly contagious pathogen.","Parasa, Sravanthi; Desai, Madhav; Thoguluva Chandrasekar, Viveksandeep; Patel, Harsh K; Kennedy, Kevin F; Roesch, Thomas; Spadaccini, Marco; Colombo, Matteo; Gabbiadini, Roberto; Artifon, Everson L A; Repici, Alessandro; Sharma, Prateek",JAMA Netw Open,669,23

In patients with severe symptoms of the disease, pneumonia develops due to Covid-19 virus. This causes intense involvement and damage in lungs. Although the emergence of the disease occurred a short time ago, many literature studies have been carried out in which these effects of the disease on the lungs were revealed by the help of lung CT imaging. In this study, 1.396 lung CT images in total (386 Covid-19 and 1.010 Non-Covid-19) were subjected to automatic classification. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), one of the deep learning methods, was used which suggested automatic classification of CT images of lungs for early diagnosis of Covid-19 disease. In addition, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to compare the classification successes of deep learning with machine learning. Within the scope of the study, a 23-layer CNN architecture was designed and used as a classifier. Also, training and testing processes were performed for Alexnet and Mobilenetv2 CNN architectures as well. The classification results were also calculated for the case of increasing the number of images used in training for the first 23-layer CNN architecture by 5, 10, and 20 times using data augmentation methods. To reveal the effect of the change in the number of images in the training and test clusters on the results, two different training and testing processes, 2-fold and 10-fold cross-validation, were performed and the results of the study were calculated. As a result, thanks to these detailed calculations performed within the scope of the study, a comprehensive comparison of the success of the texture analysis method, machine learning, and deep learning methods in Covid-19 classification from CT images was made.

The model simulates an infection process in which they were exposed to the risk of transmission of the novel coronavirus. The results of the experiments showed that individual infection prevention measures (commuting, teleworking, class closing, contact rate reduction, staying at home after fever) alone or partially combined them do not produce significant effects. On the other hand, if comprehensive measures were taken, it was confirmed that the number of deaths, the infection rate, and the number of severe hospitalised patients per day were decreased significantly at the median and maximum respectively.","Kurahashi, Setsuya",Trans.

Its rapid global spread has resulted in a major public health emergency, necessitating commensurately rapid research to improve control strategies. In particular, the ability to effectively retrace transmission chains in outbreaks remains a major challenge, partly due to our limited understanding of the virus' underlying evolutionary dynamics within and between hosts. We used high-throughput sequencing whole-genome data coupled with bottleneck analysis to retrace the pathways of viral transmission in two nosocomial outbreaks that were previously characterised by epidemiological and phylogenetic methods. Additionally, we assessed the mutational landscape, selection pressures, and diversity at the within-host level for both outbreaks. Our findings show evidence of within-host selection and transmission of variants between samples. Both bottleneck and diversity analyses highlight within-host and consensus-level variants shared by putative source-recipient pairs in both outbreaks, suggesting that certain within-host variants in these outbreaks may have been transmitted upon infection rather than arising de novo independently within multiple hosts. Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of combining within-host diversity and bottleneck estimations for elucidating transmission events in SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, provide insight into the maintenance of viral genetic diversity, provide a list of candidate targets of positive selection for further investigation, and demonstrate that within-host variants can be transferred between patients. Together these results will help in developing strategies to understand the nature of transmission events and curtail the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","San, J. E.; Ngcapu, S.; Kanzi, A.

It has been assumed, but insufficiently examined, that trait changes occur gradually over the years through the accumulation of daily experiences. The current longitudinal measurement burst study examined (a) how changes in average momentary stress reactivity are coupled with changes in trait neuroticism, (b) the extent to which this coupling is specific to stress reactivity and neuroticism, and (c) the extent to which there are age differences in the association between changes in stress reactivity and changes in neuroticism. Participants (N = 581; 50% male) between 14 and 86 years of age completed up to 3 waves (T1-T3) of Big Five trait questionnaires and experience-sampling assessments during 6 years. During each three-week experience-sampling period, participants reported their momentary affect and occurrences of hassles on average 55 times. Latent change models showed that increases over time in affective reactivity to daily hassles were associated with increases in neuroticism. This effect was consistent from T1 to T2 as well as from T2 to T3, and most pronounced in young adulthood. Importantly, the results were specific to associations between stress reactivity and neuroticism because changes in frequency of hassles in daily life did not predict changes in neuroticism, and stress reactivity did not consistently predict changes in the other Big Five traits. The findings help to inform theoretical models that outline how short-term states might contribute to gradual longer-term changes in traits like neuroticism.

CASE REPORT: The patient was an 11-year-old girl referred to a children hospital with a dry cough, fever, and headache symptoms, without comorbidity. She was hospitalized following the results of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). The patient was treated with ceftriaxone 1 g every 12 h and the oseltamivir capsule 45 mg every 12 h and azithromycin 250 mg tablet once daily and 200 mg hydroxychloroquine tablet every 12 h for a total of 5 days. After 5 days, the patient had suitable chest status and then was discharged. Azithromycin for 5 days and hydroxychloroquine for 10 days were prescribed for the patient to take at home. The patient’s polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative at baseline through the nasopharyngeal swap, but HRCT of the patient’s was completely consistent with COVID-19 accompanied by consolidation and ground-glass opacity in the left lower and right upper lobes. CONCLUSION: The numerous technical errors in taking the nasopharyngeal swap were the main reasons for the negative PCR. The main lesson from this case report is the high sensitivity and specificity of HRCT compared to the PCR.","Nasimfar, Amir; Valizadeh, Rohollah; Nanbakhsh, Mohammad",Open Access Maced. J. Med.

To date, no work has assessed how this guidance differs across governments. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to contribute to a rational and consistent global response to infectious disease by determining how guidelines differ across nations and regions. METHODS: A content analysis of health agency mask guidelines on agency websites was performed in late March 2020 among 25 countries and regions with large numbers of COVID-19 cases. Countries and regions were assigned across the coding team by language proficiency, with Google Translate used as needed. When available, both the original and English language version of guidance were reviewed. RESULTS: All examined countries and regions had some form of guidance online, although detail and clarity differed. Although 9 countries and regions recommended surgical, medical, or unspecified masks in public and poorly ventilated places, 16 recommended against people wearing masks in public. There were 2 countries that explicitly recommended against fabric masks. In addition, 12 failed to outline the minimum basic World Health Organization guidance for masks. CONCLUSIONS: Online guidelines for face mask use to prevent COVID-19 in the general public are currently inconsistent across nations and regions, and have been changing often. Efforts to create greater standardization and clarity should be explored in light of the status of COVID-19 as a global pandemic.","Laestadius, Linnea; Wang, Yang; Ben Taleb, Ziyad; Kalan, Mohammad Ebrahimi; Cho, Young; Manganello, Jennifer",JMIR Public Health Surveill,669,23

Data to assess risk factors for illness severity among pregnant women with COVID-19 are limited. This study aimed to determine risk factors associated with COVID-19 illness severity among pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: Pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by molecular testing were reported during 29 March 2020-5 March 2021 through the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET). Criteria for illness severity (asymptomatic, mild, moderate-to-severe, or critical) were adapted from National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization criteria. Crude and adjusted risk ratios for moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness were calculated for selected demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Among 7950 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness was associated with age 25 years and older, healthcare occupation, prepregnancy obesity, chronic lung disease, chronic hypertension, and pregestational diabetes mellitus. Risk of moderate-to-severe or critical illness increased with the number of underlying medical or pregnancy-related conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and having underlying medical conditions were associated with increased risk of moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness among pregnant women. This information might help pregnant women understand their risk for moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness and can inform targeted public health messaging.","Galang, Romeo R; Newton, Suzanne M; Woodworth, Kate R; Griffin, Isabel; Oduyebo, Titilope; Sancken, Christina L; Olsen, Emily O039; Malley,; Aveni, Kathryn; Wingate, Heather; Shephard, Hanna; Fussman, Chris; Alaali, Zahra S; Silcox, Kristin; Siebman, Samantha; Halai, Umme-Aiman; Lopez, Camille Delgado; Lush, Mamie; Sokale, Ayomide; Barton, Jerusha; Chaudhary, Ifrah; Patrick, Paul H; Schlosser, Levi; Reynolds, Bethany; Gaarenstroom, Nicole; Chicchelly, Sarah; Read, Jennifer S; de Wilde, Leah; Mbotha, Deborah; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Hall, Aron J; Tong, Van T; Ellington, Sascha; Gilboa, Suzanne M",Clin Infect Dis,669,16

Although placental COVID-19 infection has been documented in some cases during the second- and third-trimesters, no reports are available for the first trimester of pregnancy, and no SARS-CoV-2 protein has been found in fetal tissues. We studied the placenta and fetal organs from an early pregnancy miscarriage in a COVID-19 maternal infection by immunohistochemical, reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy methods. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, viral RNA, and particles consistent with coronavirus were found in the placenta and fetal tissues, accompanied by RNA replication revealed by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) positive immunostain. Prominent damage of the placenta and fetal organs were associated with a hyperinflammatory process identified by histological examination and immunohistochemistry. The findings provided in this study document that congenital SARS-CoV-2 infection is possible during the first trimester of pregnancy and that fetal organs, such as lung and kidney, are targets for coronavirus. The infection and multi-organic fetal inflammation produced by SARS-CoV-2 during early pregnancy should alert clinicians in the assessment and management of pregnant women for possible fetal consequences and adverse perinatal outcomes.","Valdespino-Vázquez, María Y; Helguera-Repetto, Cecilia A; León-Juárez, Moises; Villavicencio-Carrisoza, Oscar; Flores-Pliego, Arturo; Moreno-Verduzco, Elsa R; Díaz-Pérez, Diana L; Villegas-Mota, Isabel; Carrasco-Ramírez, Elba; López-Martínez, Irma E; Giraldo-Gómez, David M; Lira, Rosalia; Yocupicio-Monroy, Martha; Rodríguez-Bosch, Mario; Sevilla-Reyes, Edgar E; Cortés-Bonilla, Manuel; Acevedo-Gallegos, Sandra; Merchant-Larios, Horacio; Cardona-Pérez, Jorge Arturo; Irles, Claudine",J Med Virol,669,6

Peri-urban settings in Kenya have been reported to exhibit higher rates of maternal death during labor and childbirth as compared to the general Kenyan population. Although research indicates that women in Kenya have increased access to facility-based birth in recent years, a small percentage still give birth outside of the health facility due to access challenges and poor maternal health service quality. Most studies assessing facility-based births have focused on the sociodemographic determinants of birthing location. Few studies have assessed women's user experiences and perceptions of quality of care during childbirth. Understanding women's experiences can provide different stakeholders with strategies to structure the provision of maternity care to be person-centered and to contribute to improvements in women's satisfaction with health services and maternal health outcomes. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted, whereby 70 women from the peri-urban area of Embakasi in the East side of Nairobi City in Kenya were interviewed. Respondents were aged 18 to 49 years and had delivered in a health facility in the preceding six weeks. We conducted in-depth interviews with women who gave birth at both public and private health facilities. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated for analysis. Braune and Clarke's guidelines for thematic analysis were used to generate themes from the interview data. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged from the analysis. Women had positive experiences when care was person-centered-i.e. responsive, dignified, supportive, and with respectful communication. They had negative experiences when they were mistreated, which was manifested as non-responsive care (including poor reception and long wait times), non-dignified care (including verbal and physical abuse lack of privacy and confidentiality), lack of respectful communication, and lack of supportive care (including being denied companions, neglect and abandonment, and poor facility environment). CONCLUSION: To sustain the gains in increased access to facility-based births, there is a need to improve person-centered care to ensure women have positive facility-based childbirth experiences.","Oluoch-Aridi, Jackline; Afulani, Patience A; Guzman, Danice B; Makanga, Cindy; Miller-Graff, Laura",Reprod Health,669,16

Certain individuals have a greater tendency of negative behavioral aspects including aggression. The quest to identify tunderlying genetic causes has led to identification of a number of genetic markers, one of them is the monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) gene. Objective: We aimed to genotype a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) in the promoter region and a functional SNP within this gene (T941G, dbSNP ID: rs6323) in the recruited cohort of 482 subjects. Methods: After DNA isolation, genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP and the results were confirmed by sequencing. Results: For VNTRs, the results showed, highest frequency of 3.5 repeats in males and 4 repeats in females in the promoter region. The genotype frequencies for the SNP in cases were GG=16.3%, TG=20.6% and TT=63.1%, while in controls, the frequencies were GG=12.7%, TG=6.3%, and TT=81.0%. The allele frequencies were significantly different between cases and controls (p=0.015; OR=1.51; CI=1.085-2.102). Conclusion: The selected VNTR and SNP appeared to be significantly associated with aggression. These VNTRs and SNP have not been studied previously in the Pakistani population, hence they represent a unique ethnic group. These results, however, would have to be replicated in larger cohorts.","Sarwar, Sumbal; Hasnain, Shahida",Afr Health Sci,669,5

While these apps can be very effective in stopping the transmission chain and saving lives, their adoption remains under the expected critical mass. The public debate about contact tracing apps emphasizes general privacy reservations and is conducted at an expert level, but lacks the user perspective related to actual designs. To address this gap, we explore user preferences for contact tracing apps using market research techniques, and specifically conjoint analysis. Our main contributions are empirical insights into individual and group preferences, as well as insights for prescriptive design. While our results confirm the privacy-preserving design of most European contact tracing apps, they also provide a more nuanced understanding of acceptable features. Based on market simulation and variation analysis, we conclude that adding goal-congruent features will play an important role in fostering mass adoption.","Naous, Dana; Bonner, Manus; Humbert, Mathias; Legner, Christine",,669,24

Here we document population-wide shifts in dietary interests in 12 countries in 2020, as revealed through timeseries of Google search volumes. We find that during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic there was an overall surge in food interest, larger and longer-lasting than the surge during typical end-of-year holidays. The changes were strongly associated with population-wide mobility patterns. Using a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design, we estimate that the shock of decreased mobility manifested as a drastic increase in interest in consuming food at home, with interest in recipes and related entities increasing by 90% on average across countries, and a corresponding decrease in consuming food outside of home, with the interest in restaurants decreasing by 54% on average. We find that, in addition to the volume of searched foods, the nature of searched foods also changed. The most drastic (up to threefold) increases occurred for calorie-dense carbohydrate-based foods such as pastries, bakery products, bread, pies, and desserts. In terms of the relative share (rather than absolute volume) of search interest, the most prominent increases occurred for carbohydrate-based foods, whereas the share of interest in other food categories on average remained robust. The observed shifts in dietary interests have the potential to affect food consumption and health outcomes of people worldwide. These findings can inform governmental and organizational decisions regarding measures to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on diet and nutrition, and thus on population health.","Gligoric, Kristina; Chiolero, Arnaud; Kiciman, Emre; White, Ryen W.; West, Robert",,669,7

The purpose of this study was to assess spine surgeon reliance on virtual medicine during the pandemic and to discuss the future of virtual medicine in spine surgery. METHODS: A comprehensive survey addressing demographic data and virtual medicine practices was distributed to spine surgeons worldwide between March 27, 2020, and April 4, 2020. RESULTS: 902 spine surgeons representing seven global regions responded. 35.6% of surgeons were identified as ""high telehealth users,"" conducting more than half of clinic visits virtually. Predictors of high telehealth utilization included working in an academic practice (OR = 1.68, p = 0.0015) and practicing in Europe/North America (OR 3.42, p < 0.0001). 80.1% of all surgeons were interested in online education. Dedicating more than 25% of one's practice to teaching (OR = 1.89, p = 0.037) predicted increased interest in online education. 26.2% of respondents were identified as ""virtual medicine surgeons,"" defined as surgeons with both high telehealth usage and increased interest in online education. Living in Europe/North America and practicing in an academic practice increased odds of being a virtual medicine surgeon by 2.28 (p = 0.002) and 1.15 (p = 0.0082), respectively. 93.8% of surgeons reported interest in a centralized platform facilitating surgeon-to-surgeon communication.

In Mexico, the conditions requiring the declaration of a sanitary emergency were reached by the last week of March 2020, and health authorities' limited mobility and imposed social isolation were the main strategies to keep the virus from spreading. Thus, daily living conditions changed drastically in a few days, generating a stressful situation characterized by an almost complete lack of mobility, social isolation, and forced full-time interactions with family members. Soon, complaints of sleep disturbances, anxiety, and symptoms of depression were reported. The present study reports the results of an online survey performed during the first two months of isolation. Questionnaires exploring sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression were sent to people who responded to an open invitation. A total of 1230 participants filled out the sleep questionnaire, 812 responded to the anxiety questionnaire, and 814 responded to the depression questionnaire. Both men and women reported poor sleep quality, but women showed a higher proportion (79%) than men (60%); young women were more likely to be affected by social isolation. Concerning anxiety and depression, both sexes reported high similar symptoms. These data suggest that stressful conditions related to social isolation and the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic may induce mental health disturbances, which may become worse with sleep restriction.","Terán-Pérez, Guadalupe; Portillo-Vásquez, Angelica; Arana-Lechuga, Yoaly; Sánchez-Escandón, Oscar; Mercadillo-Caballero, Roberto; González-Robles, Rosa Obdulia; Velázquez-Moctezuma, Javier",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),669,1

Healthcare professionals and students globally are experiencing an increasingly 'VUCA' (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) healthcare and educational climate. Our future medical workforce needs skillsets to manage the personal and emotional challenges of work, uncertainty and change. These include organization, time management, proactive and consistent clinical skill development, effective communication, person-centred approaches, self-reflection and self-care. This is critical for success during undergraduate medical education and ongoing clinical practice to build personal resilience, provide the best possible clinical care in a different healthcare ecosystem, innovate for better healthcare systems and advocate for more vulnerable communities. Our faculty and students have been eager to learn and apply solution-oriented coaching skills to help to mitigate against burnout, hold more rewarding, person-centred conversations in clinical practice and enable them personally to respond flexibly and adapt constructively to change.

Drawing from the motivational design model of the ARCS (i.e., attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction), this study attempts to fill the gap to evaluate effectiveness of blended learning from a multi‐dimensional perspective. Participants were randomly assigned into three experimental groups (i.e., face‐to‐face, pure online, and blended). A questionnaire survey was administered in each group after the trial courses. The data was analysed by using the one‐way ANOVA with post hoc tests. The results showed that blended learning outperformed pure online learning in enhancing students' attention, confidence, and satisfaction perceptions. Additionally, blended learning had a higher level of satisfaction perception than face‐to‐face learning. Follow‐up interviews were also conducted to provide an in‐depth understanding of how blended learning motivated students during the learning process. Considering that blended learning may become a new normal in higher education after the Covid‐19 pandemic, the findings of the present study provide evidences to support the effectiveness of the blended learning approach in addressing students' motivational needs.

A scale has been recently designed to assess COVID-19-related phobic reactions named the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S). The present study aimed to evaluate factor structure, reliability, and validity of the Persian version of the C19P-S (Persian-C19P-S) in patients with anxiety disorders and to compare COVID-19-related phobia among these patients. Three hundred patients with anxiety disorders completed the Persian-C19P-S and other scales assessing anxiety traits (e.g., the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI), the Health Concerns Questionnaire-54 (HCQ-54), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4)) and COVID-19-related distress (e.g., the COVID Stress Scales (CSS) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19)). The results showed that the Persian-C19P-S replicated the four-factor structure of the original C19P-S. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability coefficients evidenced the reliability of the scale. The validity of the scale (convergent and discriminant validity) was confirmed. Patients who had generalized anxiety and panic disorders showed higher phobic reactions related to COVID-19 than those with social anxiety disorder and specific phobia. This study indicates that the Persian version of the C19P-S is a valid scale to be used in Iranian patients with anxiety disorders to evaluate COVID-19-related phobia. Moreover, COVID-19-related phobic reactions are higher in some specific types of anxiety disorders.","Samimi Ardestani, Seyed Mehdi; Khosravani, Vahid; Sharifi Bastan, Farangis; Baloglu, Mustafa",Int J Ment Health Addict,669,23

We evaluated the effectiveness and implementation of a community-delivered group-based functional power training (FPT) program for frail older adults within their neighborhoods. A two-arm, multicenter assessor-blind stratified randomized controlled trial was conducted at four local senior activity centers in Singapore. Sixty-one community-dwelling older adults with low handgrip strength were randomized to intervention (IG) or control (CG) group. The IG underwent the FPT program (power and balance exercises using simple equipment) delivered by a community service provider. The 12-week program comprised 2 × 60 min sessions/week. CG continued usual activities at the centers. Functional performance, muscle strength, and frailty status were assessed at baseline and 3 months. Program implementation was evaluated using RE-AIM framework. The program was halted due to Coronavirus Disease 2019-related suspension of senior center activities. Results are reported from four centers, which completed the program. IG showed significantly greater improvement in the Short Physical Performance Battery test as compared to CG (p = 0.047). No effects were found for timed up and go test performance, muscle strength, and frailty status. The community program exhibited good reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation. Our study demonstrated that FPT was associated with greater improvement in physical function in pre-frail/frail participants as compared to exercise activities offered at local senior activity centers.

Participants and MethodsFrom July 2019 to June 2020, we surveyed Health Care Workers (HCW) pre and post COVID19 in an independent local community hospital for burnout with the Health Care Provider Wellness Assessment tool. Linear regression and means comparison were used to identify overall job demand and resource perception with burnout, unique stressor portraits by provider subtype and mean survey scores between those who did or did not voluntarily complete at least 14 days of a 28 day novel self-help intervention tool. ResultsRegarding the pre COVID-19 data, of 73 respondents, there was statistically significant (p<.01) correlation between overall job demands (directly) and resources (inversely) with burnout intensity. With respect to the HCW stressor characteristic analyses there was statistical significance (p<.05) between the mean frequency occurrence of the top 5 stressors identified by respondent subtype when compared to the mean occurrence of overall individual responses within the corresponding subtype. Finally, although limited by a low number of respondents, the intervention tool analysis suggested a therapeutic trend toward disruption of the stress-burnout relationship. Regarding the post COVID-19 data, 18 respondents did not show statistically significant characterizable stressor portraits (ie stressors were present but not patternable). ConclusionUnique stressor portraits were identified by HCW subtype which correlated with more intense burnout self-perception. Additionally, there was a trend toward self-help tool efficacy in mitigating burnout.","Sels, Jessica; Carroll, Dylan; Duffee, Douglas",,669,24

Guidelines regarding face mask use have evolved from the time when COVID-19 first emerged. Practices for face mask use in the United States vary widely. METHODS: Clinical and nonclinical staff from a pediatric health care system were invited to complete a survey regarding perceptions and practices of face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall results were analyzed, and subgroup analyses were conducted to compare clinical and nonclinical staff, and clinical staff who do and do not provide direct patient care. RESULTS: The response rate was approximately 24% (1,128 of 4,698). Most respondents were clinical staff who provide patient care. A surgical/procedure mask was most often worn for patient care by 72% (P < .001). Most respondents (70%) reported wearing a cloth mask when not in the hospital (P < .001). Cloth masks were worn for a mean of 3.4 ± 3.9 d before washing. Frequent hand hygiene before putting on the mask, before removing, and after removing was reported as 56%, 44%, and 62%, respectively. The most common challenges reported were glasses fogging (69%), skin irritations (45%), and headaches (31%). Qualitative data revealed themes of feeling unsafe, beliefs and practices about COVID-19 and masks, mandates and enforcement of wearing masks, availability of personal protective equipment, and care delivery challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Practices and perceptions of face masks varied among staff in a pediatric health care system. Some staff did not feel that masks are effective in preventing virus spread, and others did not feel safe in performing job duties. Hand hygiene for mask handling was not practiced consistently. A large number of staff reported having experienced challenges or health issues when wearing a mask. Clinical staff who provide direct patient care reported more issues than both nonclinical and clinical staff who do not provide care.","Willis, L Denise; Lovenstein, Austin; Spray, Beverly J; Honeycutt, Michele; Walden, Marlene",Respir. care,669,23

The whole process of vaccination was monitored by clinical pharmacists, and the occurrence, types, severity of adverse reactions were recorded in detail. Through the investigation and analysis on the safety of COVID-19 vaccination of the 2305 people, the important role and value of clinical pharmacists in the vaccination process was elaborated. Common adverse reactions included local pain, dizziness and fatigue, with the incidence rates of 2.09%, 0.67% and 0.49%, respectively. Others such as headache, nausea, skin itching, cough, palpitation, dry mouth, hand anesthesia, local induration, muscle soreness, local rash, and chill had incidence rates of less than 0.30%. Three cases of serious adverse events that occurred in this vaccination returned to normal after treatment, with no subsequent discomfort. Clinical pharmacists played an important role in the safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination. The safety of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine is good.

While little information is available, research is currently in progress to comprehensively understand the general biology and immune response mechanism against SARS-CoV-2. The spike proteins (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 perform a crucial function in viral infection establishment. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 play a pivotal role in viral entry. Upon viral entry, the released pro-inflammatory proteins (cytokines and chemokines) cause the migration of the T cells, monocytes, and macrophages to the infection site. IFNÏ released by T cells initiates a loop of pro-inflammatory feedback. The inflammatory state may further enhance with an increase in immune dysfunction responsible for the infection's progression. A treatment approach that prevents ACE2-mediated viral entry and reduces inflammatory response is a crucial therapeutic intervention strategy, and nanomaterials and their conjugates are promising candidates. Nanoparticles can inhibit viral entry and replication. Nanomaterials have also found application in targeted drug delivery and also in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we briefly summarize the origin, transmission, and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2. We then discussed the immune response mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we further discussed nanotechnology's potentials as an intervention strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. All these understandings will be crucial in developing therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.","Mba, Ifeanyi Elibe; Sharndama, Hyelnaya Cletus; Osondu-Chuka, Goodness Ogechi; Okeke, Onyekachi Philomena",Infect Dis (Lond),669,1

Regulators in numerous countries have authorised or approved COVID-19 vaccines for human use, with more expected to be licensed in 2021. Yet having licensed vaccines is not enough to achieve global control of COVID-19: they also need to be produced at scale, priced affordably, allocated globally so that they are available where needed, and widely deployed in local communities. In this Health Policy paper, we review potential challenges to success in each of these dimensions and discuss policy implications. To guide our review, we developed a dashboard to highlight key characteristics of 26 leading vaccine candidates, including efficacy levels, dosing regimens, storage requirements, prices, production capacities in 2021, and stocks reserved for low-income and middle-income countries. We use a traffic-light system to signal the potential contributions of each candidate to achieving global vaccine immunity, highlighting important trade-offs that policy makers need to consider when developing and implementing vaccination programmes. Although specific datapoints are subject to change as the pandemic response progresses, the dashboard will continue to provide a useful lens through which to analyse the key issues affecting the use of COVID-19 vaccines. We also present original data from a 32-country survey (n = 26 758) on potential acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, conducted from October to December, 2020.

METHODS: We used a qualitative, narrative study design to explore perceptions surrounding caregiver identification badges via unstructured interviews. RESULTS: We identified key hospital and family stakeholders. Unstructured interviews supported the theory that badge optimization could improve communication and patient care. Our initiative, however, was abruptly interrupted by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Communication with patients and families is crucial across medical disciplines. The optimization of caregiver identification badges to facilitate the use of preferred names and pronouns will ultimately lead to the more effective and safer delivery of high-quality care.","Duan, Lucy; Hadjinicolaou, Aris; Kraus, Raphaël; Lirette, Marie-Pier; Beck, Carolyn E; Gardam, Michael",Healthc Q,669,24

Thus native conformational RBD protein may facilitate biochemical identification of RBD and provide valuable support of drug and vaccine design for curing COVID-19. We attempted to express RBD under CMV promoter in vitro, but failed. RBD-specific mRNA cannot be detected in cell transfected with recombinant plasmids, in which CMV promoter governs the RBD transcription. Additionally, the pCMV-Tag2B-SARS_CoV2_RBD trans-inactivates CMV promoter transcription activity. Alternatively, we identified that both Chicken ß-actin promoter and Vaccinia virus-specific medium/late (M/L) promoter (pSYN) can highly precede SARS_CoV2 RBD expression.

To examine this phenomenon, this study compared the sedentary behavior (SB) of Thai adults before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. The 2019 and 2020 datasets of Thailand's Surveillance on Physical Activity (SPA) were employed. A total of 5379 (SPA2019) and 6531 (SPA202020) persons age 18-64 years who had access to the Internet were included in the analysis. Measures imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19 infection were significantly associated with lower opportunity of Thai adults for work-related physical movement, and that increased their SB, particularly with the shift from onsite to online working platforms. Cumulative SB increased from 824 (before the pandemic) to 875 min/day during the pandemic. The odds of accumulating >13 h/day of SB was highest among females, young adults, those who completed post-secondary education, unemployed or working in the non-agriculture sector, having a chronic disease/condition, residing in an urban area, and living in a 'higher-risk' pandemic zone. The insignificant association of physical activity (PA) and the Fit from Home (FFH) intervention in reducing SB during the pandemic suggests that PA is not directly associated with SB, and that the FFH intervention was insufficient to prevent SB.","Katewongsa, Piyawat; Potharin, Danusorn; Rasri, Niramon; Palakai, Rungrat; Widyastari, Dyah Anantalia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),669,21

Through a qualitative analysis it was found that the major themes associated with empowerment are community, decisions, family and values thus showcasing the economic and social implications.Research Questions/ObjectivesCan the concept of women empowerment be de-urbanized?Do women through formalized initiatives feel empowered and experience heightened self-esteem?Can the setting up of micro-entrepreneurial ventures at the village level provide an impetus to alter the existing social structures and power inequalities?Links to Theory:Women Empowerment, group approach and power, self-esteemPhenomenon Studied and Case Context:The Didis of the community kitchen were members registered as self-help groups with the Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society. These community kitchens or Ajeevika Didi kitchens were essentially started and implemented during the COVID pandemic period in a five-phase manner for a period of 3 months from April to June 2020. There were around 450 women who got associated in running these community kitchens. The discourses by these Didis on their association with the micro-entrepreneurial venture and their feelings of empowerment are portrayed in the case.Findings:Semi-structured interviews for the sample respondents were conducted and then auto-coded themes, namely, community, decisions, family and values were obtained using the NVivo software. The sentiment analysis of the transcribed interview conversations revealed more of positive sentiments that were centred around the belief that such micro-entrepreneurial opportunities can largely improve their lives and ease out the inequalities that are experienced by them on the power and control fronts. On an overall basis it was observed that when the financial and psychological aspirations were met, fulfilment and satisfaction were the primary outcomes for the study participants.Discussions:The present case is aimed for discussion in the entrepreneurship classes of management, especially related to social entrepreneurship, women empowerment and contribution of women to the economy and society. The case highlights that woman?s contribution towards the society and family could be impacted through a woman?s own sense of self-worth and self-esteem. This case highlights further that micro-enterprises that are community level are both a social and economic phenomenon, manifesting benefits for the individual as well as the society.","Mahato, Madhuri Vardhan Julie",South Asian Journal of Business and Management Cases,669,1

The derivation of this model is a common topic for upper-level chemistry courses. But, due to its abstract nature, this derivation can often seem like a mathematical exercise detached from the molecular origins of absorption. Here, we present an activity centered around a simulation of absorption using spheres and cylinders. By interacting with variables in the simulation in a guided-inquiry format, students can connect the submicroscopic interactions between photons and molecules with the mathematical relationships that ultimately give rise to the Beer-Lambert Law. The activity presented here was implemented as a virtual lab for a cohort of analytical chemistry students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our evaluation of student responses shows the promise of this activity for encouraging students to engage in the scientific practice of modeling the submicroscopic nature of absorption to understand the development of Beer's Law. In addition, we discuss how patterns observed in student responses have informed improvements to the activity for future implementations and identify some additional learning contexts to which the interactive simulation can be applied. © 2021 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.","Spitha, N.; Doolittle, P.

The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate numbers of admissions in incident and prevalent atrial fibrillation and flutter (AF) and to analyse care pathways in comparison to 2019. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of claims data of 74 German Helios hospitals was performed to identify consecutive patients hospitalized with a main discharge diagnosis of AF. A study period including the start of the German national protection phase (13 March 2020 to 16 July 2020) was compared to a previous year control cohort (15 March 2019 to 18 July 2019), with further sub-division into early and late phase. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated. Numbers of admission per day (A/day) for incident and prevalent AF and care pathways including readmissions, numbers of transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), electrical cardioversion (CV), and catheter ablation (CA) were analysed. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in total AF admissions both in the early (44.4 vs. 77.5 A/day, IRR 0.57 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.61], P < 0.01) and late (59.1 vs. 63.5 A/day, IRR 0.93 [95% CI 0.90-0.96], P < 0.01) phases, length of stay was significantly shorter (3.3 ± 3.1 nights vs. 3.5 ± 3.6 nights, P < 0.01), admissions were more frequently in high-volume centres (77.0% vs. 75.4%, P = 0.02), and frequency of readmissions was reduced (21.7% vs. 23.6%, P < 0.01) compared to the previous year. Incident AF admission rates were significantly lower both in the early (21.9 admission per day vs. 41.1 A/day, IRR 0.53 [95% CI 0.48-0.58]) and late (35.5 vs. 39.3 A/day, IRR 0.90 [95% CI 0.86-0.95]) phases, whereas prevalent admissions were only lower in the early phase (22.5 vs. 36.4 A/day IRR 0.62 [95% CI 0.56-0.68]), but not in the late phase (23.6 vs. 24.2 A/day IRR 0.97 [95% CI 0.92-1.03]). Analysis of care pathways showed reduced numbers of TEE during the early phase [34.7% vs. 41.4%, odds ratio (OR) 0.74 [95% CI 0.64-0.86], P < 0.01], but not during the late phase (39.9% vs. 40.2%, OR 0.96 [95% CI 0.88-1.03], P = 0.26). Numbers of CV were comparable during early (40.6% vs. 39.7%, OR 1.08 [95% CI 0.94-1.25], P = 0.27) and late (38.6% vs. 37.5%, OR 1.06 [95% CI 0.98-1.14], P = 0.17) phases, compared to the previous year, respectively. Numbers of CA were comparable during the early phase (21.6% vs. 21.1%, OR 0.98 [95% CI 0.82-1.17], P = 0.82) with a distinct increase during the late phase (22.9% vs. 21.5%, OR 1.05 [95% CI 0.96-1.16], P = 0.28). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, AF admission rates declined significantly, with a more pronounced reduction in incident than in prevalent AF. Overall AF care was maintained during early and late pandemic phases with only minor changes, namely less frequent use of TEE. Confirmation of these findings in other study populations and identification of underlying causes are required to ensure optimal therapy in patients with AF during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ueberham, Laura; König, Sebastian; Pellissier, Vincent; Hohenstein, Sven; Meier-Hellmann, Andreas; Kuhlen, Ralf; Hindricks, Gerhard; Bollmann, Andreas",Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes,669,16

We develop an extension of the SEIR epidemic model that captures the effects of changes in human mobility on the spread of the disease. The parameters of the model are learned using a multitask learning approach that leverages both data on the number of deaths across a set of regions, and cellphone data on individuals' mobility patterns specific to each region. Using this model, we propose a nonlinear optimal control problem aiming to find the optimal mobility-based intervention strategy that curbs the spread of the epidemic while obeying a budget on the economic cost incurred. We also show that the solution to this nonlinear optimal control problem can be efficiently found, in polynomial time, using tools from geometric programming. Furthermore, in the absence of a straightforward mapping from human mobility data to economic costs, we propose a practical method by which a budget on economic losses incurred may be chosen to eliminate excess deaths due to over-utilization of hospital resources. Our results are demonstrated with numerical simulations using real data from the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philadelphia metropolitan area.","Hayhoe, Mikhail; Barreras, Francisco; Preciado, Victor M",Annual reviews in control,669,0

In response, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has issued guidance on which groups should be prioritized to receive vaccines. For the first phase of vaccine allocation, the ACIP recommended healthcare personnel and long-term care facility residents as recipients. This recommendation was based on risks endemic to these populations, as well as ethical principles related to benefits and harms, mitigating health inequalities, and promoting justice. Commercial truck drivers have played a vital and underappreciated role during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the indispensable role that commercial drivers play in distributing vaccines, they have not been recommended for vaccine allocation in the next phase (1b) by the ACIP. However, the rationale and ethical principles cited for the first vaccine phase suggest that these workers should be recommended for inclusion. By doing so, the acquisition and transmission of COVID-19 may be mitigated, which would benefit both these workers and the US public. Further, persistent vulnerabilities render commercial truck drivers susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection; therefore, vaccination during the next phase is imperative to curb the exacerbation of extant health inequities. Finally, because present-day COVID-19 vulnerabilities in these workers have been shaped by unjust policies over the past several decades, and because COVID-19 public health policies have excluded and potentially exacerbated the impacts of the pandemic for these workers, allocating vaccines to commercial truck drivers is a necessary step toward promoting justice.","Lemke, Michael K",Am J Ind Med,669,1

Radiation oncology institutions (ROI) deliver a major component of cancer treatment, with protocols that might span over several weeks, with the result of increasing susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and presenting with a more severe clinical course when compared with the general population. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate the impact of ROI protocols and performance on daily practice in the high-risk cancer patients during this pandemic. METHODS: We addressed the incidence of positive COVID-19 cases in both patients and health care workers (HCW), in addition to the protective measures adopted in ROIs in Germany, Austria and Switzerland using a specific questionnaire. RESULTS: The results of the questionnaire showed that a noteworthy number of ROIs were able to complete treatment in SARS-CoV­2 positive cancer patients, with only a short interruption. The ROIs reported a significant decrease in patient volume that was not impacted by the circumambient disease incidence, the type of ROI or the occurrence of positive cases. Of the ROIs 16.5% also reported infected HCWs. About half of the ROIs (50.5%) adopted a screening program for patients whereas only 23.3% also screened their HCWs. The range of protective measures included the creation of working groups, instituting home office work and protection with face masks. Regarding the therapeutic options offered, curative procedures were performed with either unchanged or moderately decreased schedules, whereas palliative or benign radiotherapy procedures were more often shortened. Most ROIs postponed or cancelled radiation treatment for benign indications (88.1%). The occurrence of SARS-CoV­2 infections did not affect the treatment options for curative procedures. Non-university-based ROIs seemed to be more willing to change their treatment options for curative and palliative cases than university-based ROIs. CONCLUSION: Most ROIs reported a deep impact of SARS-CoV­2 infections on their work routine. Modification and prioritization of treatment regimens and the application of protective measures preserved a well-functioning radiation oncology service and patient care.","Matuschek, Christiane; Fischer, Johannes C; Combs, Stephanie E; Fietkau, Rainer; Corradini, Stefanie; Zänker, Kurt; Bölke, Edwin; Djiepmo-Njanang, Freddy-Joel; Tamaskovics, Balint; Fischer, Joachim E; Stuschke, Martin; Pöttgen, Christoph; Förster, Robert; Zwahlen, Daniel R; Papachristofilou, Alexandros; Ganswindt, Ute; Pelka, Rainer; Schneider, E Marion; Feldt, Torsten; Jensen, Björn Erik Ole; Häussinger, Dieter; Knoefel, Wolfram Trudo; Kindgen-Milles, Detlef; Pedoto, Alessia; Grebe, Olaf; van Griensven, Martijn; Budach, Wilfried; Haussmann, Jan",Strahlenther Onkol,669,1

In addition to conventional infectious diseases with which we are familiar, emerging infectious diseases, such as Zika virus infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have also been suggested to be associated with GBS. GBS is mainly categorized into a demyelinating subtype known as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) and an axonal subtype known as acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). Most patients who develop GBS after Zika virus infection or COVID-19 have AIDP. The concept of molecular mimicry between pathogens and human peripheral nerve components was established through studies of AMAN with anti-ganglioside GM1 antibodies occurring after Campylobacter jejuni infection. Although such mimicry between specific pathogens and myelin or Schwann cell components has not been clearly demonstrated in AIDP, a similarity of Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2 proteins to human proteins has been suggested. With the development of global commerce and travel, emerging infectious diseases will continue to threaten public health. From this viewpoint, the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs is important to prepare for and control emerging infectious diseases. Although a decrease in the number of patients after the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic increased the difficulty in conducting phase 3 trials for Zika virus vaccines, the efficacy and safety of new vaccines have recently been demonstrated for COVID-19. In general, vaccines can decrease the risk of infectious disease by stimulating the immune system, and discussions regarding an increased risk of autoimmune disorders, such as GBS, have been ongoing for many years. However, the risk of GBS is not considered a legitimate reason to limit the administration of currently available vaccines, as only a trivial association or no association with GBS has been demonstrated.","Koike, Haruki; Chiba, Atsuro; Katsuno, Masahisa",,669,1

Therapeutic benefits of using RDS for both disease control and prevention, in the effort to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have been shown. However, the biochemically active constituents of RDS and their mechanisms of action are still unclear. The goal of the present study is to clarify the material foundation and action mechanism of RDS. METHODS: To conduct an analysis of RDS, an integrative analytical platform was constructed, including target prediction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and cluster analysis; further, the hub genes involved in the disease-related pathways were identified, and the their corresponding compounds were used for in vitro validation of molecular docking predictions. The presence of these validated compounds was also measured in samples of the RDS formula to quantify the abundance of the biochemically active constituents. In our network pharmacological study, a total of 26 bioinformatic programs and databases were used, and six networks, covering the entire Zang-fu viscera, were constructed to comprehensively analyze the intricate connections among the compounds-targets-disease pathways-meridians of RDS. RESULTS: For all 1071 known chemical constituents of the nine ingredients in RDS, identified from established TCM databases, 157 passed drug-likeness screening and led to 339 predicted targets in the constituent-target network. Forty-two hub genes with core regulatory effects were extracted from the PPI network, and 134 compounds and 29 crucial disease pathways were implicated in the target-constituent-disease network. Twelve disease pathways attributed to the Lung-Large Intestine meridians, with six and five attributed to the Kidney-Urinary Bladder and Stomach-Spleen meridians, respectively. One-hundred and eighteen candidate constituents showed a high binding affinity with SARS-coronavirus-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), as indicated by molecular docking using computational pattern recognition. The in vitro activity of 22 chemical constituents of RDS was validated using the 3CLpro inhibition assay. Finally, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in data-independent analysis mode, the presence of seven out of these 22 constituents was confirmed and validated in an aqueous decoction of RDS, using reference standards in both non-targeted and targeted approaches. CONCLUSION: RDS acts primarily in the Lung-Large Intestine, Kidney-Urinary Bladder and Stomach-Spleen meridians, with other Zang-fu viscera strategically covered by all nine ingredients. In the context of TCM meridian theory, the multiple components and targets of RDS contribute to RDS's dual effects of health-strengthening and pathogen-eliminating. This results in general therapeutic effects for early COVID-19 control and prevention.","Zhang, Zi-Jia; Wu, Wen-Yong; Hou, Jin-Jun; Zhang, Lin-Lin; Li, Fei-Fei; Gao, Lei; Wu, Xing-Dong; Shi, Jing-Ying; Zhang, Rong; Long, Hua-Li; Lei, Min; Wu, Wan-Ying; Guo, De-An; Chen, Kai-Xian; Hofmann, Lewis A; Ci, Zhong-Hua",J Integr Med,669,19

Its cleavage action is an essential activation step for the endothelial pathogenicity of several viruses including SARS-CoV-2. This Furin-mediated endothelial tropism seems to underlie the multi-organ system involvement of COVID-19; which is a feature that was not recognized in the older versions of coronaviridae. Obese and diabetic patients, males, and the elderly, have increased serum levels of Furin, with its increased cellular activity; this might explain why these subgroups are at an increased risk of COVID-19 related complications and deaths. In contrast, smoking decreases cellular levels of Furin, this finding may be at the origin of the decreased severity of COVID-19 in smokers. Chinese herbal derived luteolin is suggested to be putative Furin inhibitor, with previous success against Dengue Fever. Additionally, Furin intracellular levels are largely dependent on concentration of intracellular ions, notably sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Consequently, the use of ion channel inhibitors, such as Calcium Channel blockers or Potassium Channel blockers, can prevent cellular transfection early in the course of the illness. Nicotine patches and Colchicine have also been suggested as potential therapies due to Furin mediated inhibition of COVID-19.","AbdelMassih, Antoine Fakhry; Ye, Jianping; Kamel, Aya; Mishriky, Fady; Ismail, Habiba-Allah; Ragab, Heba Amin; El Qadi, Layla; Malak, Lauris; Abdu, Mariam; El-Husseiny, Miral; Ashraf, Mirette; Hafez, Nada; AlShehry, Nada; El-Husseiny, Nadine; AbdelRaouf, Nora; Shebl, Noura; Hafez, Nouran; Youssef, Nourhan; Afdal, Peter; Hozaien, Rafeef; Menshawey, Rahma; Saeed, Rana; Fouda, Raghda",Obes.

The study is unique in a large number of nations examined, the range of vaccine controls, in testing effects of combinations of vaccinations, and in examining the relationship of COVID-19 and vaccination rates to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Analysis of Italian regions and the states of the United States were also performed. Significant positive correlations were found between IPD (but not lower respiratory infections) and COVID-19 rates, while significant negative correlations were found between pneumococcal vaccination and COVID-19 rates. Influenza and MMR vaccination rates were negatively correlated with lower respiratory infection (LRI) rates and may synergize with pneumococcal vaccination rates to protect against COVID-19. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination rates were independent of other vaccination rates. These results suggest that endemic rates of bacterial pneumonias, for which pneumococci are a sentinel, may set regional and national susceptibility to severe COVID-19 disease and death.","Root-Bernstein, Robert",Vaccines,669,26

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Specimens were collected from 200 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (disease group) and 200 normal children (control group) in our hospital. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood nucleated cells in both groups to detect the gene polymorphisms rs2069830 and rs2069836 of IL-6, as well as rs3024489 and rs3024493 of IL-10. Then, the content of serum IL-6 and IL-10 was determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: It was found that there were differences in the distribution of alleles of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 (p=0.000) and IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024493 (p=0.007) between the disease group and control group. The frequency of T allele of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 was higher, while that of IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024493 was lower in the disease group. Besides, the differences in the distribution of genotypes of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 (p=0.000) and IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024493 (p=0.000) were also observed between the disease group and control group. Moreover, the disease group had higher frequencies of TT genotype of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 and TA genotype of IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024493. The frequencies of dominant model of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 (p=0.048) and recessive model of IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024493 (p=0.000) in the disease group were different from those in the control group. In addition, the frequency of CC + CT dominant model of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 was lower, and the frequency of TA + AA recessive model of IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024493 was higher in the disease group. There were differences in haplotypes CG (p=0.001), CT (p=0.007), and TG (p=0.000) of IL-6 gene, as well as haplotypes AA (p=0.002) and AT (p=0.005) of IL-10 gene between disease group and control group. Furthermore, the content of IL-6 in the serum was associated with the genotypes of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 (p<0.05), whereas the children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia carrying CT genotype had remarkably higher content of serum IL-6. The genotypes of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 was notably related to white blood cell (WBC) (p=0.002), and the WBC level was higher in children with CT genotype. The genotypes of IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024489 had prominent correlations with platelet (PLT) (p=0.043), and the children with AA genotype had a higher PLT level. In addition, the genotypes of IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024493 were evidently correlated with hemoglobin, which was significantly higher in children carrying TA genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The gene polymorphisms of IL-6 and IL-10 are significantly correlated with the susceptibility to and pathogenesis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","Liu, R-T; Wang, X-X; Sun, J-R; Gao, N; Yu, W-Z",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,669,30

METHODS: We conducted a scoping review through different search strategies in MEDLINE and Google Scholar to identify the available literature reporting data on implementation and usefulness of various modalities of telemedicine during the current pandemic. We summarized the included studies according to field and mode of implementation in a narrative way. RESULTS: We included 45 studies that fulfilled selection criteria. About 38% of the studies were conducted in the United States of America (USA), followed by 15.5% in India and 15.5% in China. Most studies (73%) were cross-sectional studies based on historical records. All publications were written in English with the exception of 1 studied published in Spanish. The majority of reports focused on use of telemedicine for outpatient care, followed by in-hospital care. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has promoted the use of telemedicine, a tool that has transformed the provision of medical services. Several modes of implementation are useful to overcome difficulties for patient care during the pandemic. Its benefits are specific to different fields of medical practice. Such benefits, along with the guidance and reported experiences should invite health systems to work for an effective and comprehensive implementation of telemedicine in various fields.","Hincapié, María Alejandra; Gallego, Juan Carlos; Gempeler, Andrés; Piñeros, Jorge Arturo; Nasner, Daniela; Escobar, María Fernanda",J Prim Care Community Health,669,33

A retrospective analysis of patients with cervicofacial infection of dental aetiology referred to maxillofacial surgery during the initial six weeks of COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 was carried out and compared with the equivalent period in the two preceding years. Unexpectedly, during COVID-19 lockdown, there was a reduction in patients seen with cervicofacial infection of dental aetiology. This may have resulted from patient adherence to government guidelines ""Stay at home"", successful triaging of patients in primary care and emergency treatment provided by urgent dental care centres.

But we also need auxiliary data of all kinds, including data related to how populations are talking about the unfolding pandemic through news and stories.

We determine importance through our allotaxonometric instrument, rank-turbulence divergence. We make some basic observations about some of the time series, including a comparison to numbers of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 over time. We broadly observe across all languages a peak for the language-specific word for 'virus' in January 2020 followed by a decline through February and then a surge through March and April. The world's collective attention dropped away while the virus spread out from China. We host the time series on Gitlab, updating them on a daily basis while relevant.

Considering the limiting character of resource allocation, all other medical conditions must compete with the top spot of health security matters, as we currently see with the outbreak of COVID-19. Surgery is an integral part of universal health offering life-saving therapy for a variety of illnesses. Amidst the increasing nexus of infectious diseases and health security and in the view of Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC), is there a risk of global surgery falling behind? Subject and Methods: While the global undersupply of surgical care is well recorded, contextual explanations are absent. Our research introduces the constructivist concept of securitization according to the Copenhagen School to explain the structural handicap of global surgery and by that presents a structural explanation. We investigate the securitizing potential of surgical diseases in comparison to infectious diseases. Results: Surgical conditions are non-contagious without the risk for disease outbreaks, hardly preventable and their treatment is often infrastructurally demanding. These key features mark their low securitizing potential. Additionally, as PHEIC is the only securitizing institution in the realm of health, infectious diseases have a privileged role in health security. Conclusion: Surgery substantially lacks securitizing potential in comparison to communicable diseases and by that is structurally given an inferior position in a securitized health order.","Metelmann, Isabella B; Flessa, Steffen; Busemann, Alexandra",Z Gesundh Wiss,669,1

As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable human-to-human transmission in England. We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of COVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to inform population sizes and movements, together with parameter estimates from the outbreak in China. We predict that the epidemic will peak 126 to 147 days (approx. 4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in the absence of controls. Assuming biological parameters remain unchanged and transmission persists from February, we expect the peak to occur in June. Starting location and model stochasticity have a minimal impact on peak timing. However, realistic parameter uncertainty leads to peak time estimates ranging from 78 to 241 days following sustained transmission. Seasonal changes in transmission rate can substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic. We provide initial estimates of the epidemic potential of COVID-19. These results can be refined with more precise parameters. Seasonal changes in transmission could shift the timing of the peak into winter, with important implications for healthcare capacity planning.

If the government decides to impose a lockdown, it has to determine its intensity, timing and duration. We find that there are two competing effects that push the decision in opposite directions. An early lockdown is beneficial not only to slow down the spread of the disease, but creates beneficial habit formation (such as social distancing, developing hygienic habits) that persists even after the lockdown is lifted. Against this benefit of an early lockdown, there is a cost from loss of information about the virulence and spread of the disease in the population in addition to a direct cost to the economy. Based on the prior probability of the disease being virulent, we characterize the timing, intensity and duration of a lockdown with the above mentioned tradeoffs. Specifically, we show that as the precision of learning goes up, a government tends to delay the imposition of lockdown. Conversely, if the habit formation parameter is very strong, a government is likely to impose an early lockdown.","Bandyopadhyay, Siddhartha; Chatterjee, Kalyan; Das, Kaustav; Roy, Jaideep",J Math Econ,669,10

By allowing remote communication, teleconsultation may help limit the spread of the virus while maintaining the crucial patient-provider relationship. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the value of teleconsultation compared to in-person visits in the management of elective orthopedic and spinal procedures. METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study of 853 patients receiving orthopedic and spinal care at a private outpatient clinic in New Zealand. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: (1) patients receiving telephone consultation remotely, and (2) patients receiving in-person office consultations at the outpatient clinic. All patients received telephone consultations for 4 weeks during the mandated COVID-19 lockdown, followed by 4 weeks of telephone or in-person consultation. Patient preference, satisfaction, and duration of visit were recorded. Comparisons of patient preference between groups, visit type, sex, and location were performed using chi-square tests; similarly, satisfaction scores and visit durations were compared using a general linear model. RESULTS: We report that 91% (353/388) of patients in the telephone group preferred teleconsultation over in-person office visits during the COVID-19 lockdown (P<.001). A combined-group analysis showed that 55.3% (446/807) of all patients preferred teleconsultation compared to 31.2% (252/807) who preferred in-person office visits (P<.001). Patients in the telephone group reported significantly higher satisfaction scores (mean 9.95, SD 0.04, 95% CI 9.87-10.03) compared to patients in the in-person group (mean 9.53, SE 0.04, 95% CI 9.45-9.62; P<.001). Additionally, in-person consultations were significantly longer in duration compared to telephone consultations, with a mean visit time of 6.70 (SE 0.18) minutes, 95% CI 6.32-7.02, compared to 5.10 (SE 0.17) minutes, 95% CI 4.73-5.42 (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who use telephone consultations are more likely to prefer it over traditional, in-person visits in the future. This increased preference, coupled with higher patient satisfaction scores and shorter duration of visits, suggests that teleconsultation has a role in orthopedic surgery, which may even extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Melian, Christina; Frampton, Christopher; Wyatt, Michael Charles; Kieser, David",JMIR Form Res,669,16

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six electronic databases and partial gray literature were searched without date or language restrictions until September 2020. Prospective and retrospective observational cohort and case-control studies were included. The risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the checklists from the Joanna Briggs Institute and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE tool. To complement the case-control studies, the odds ratio (OR) of the individuals with allergies/asthma to develop root resorption was calculated. RESULTS: Six studies were included. One study with low RoB, one with moderate, and one with high RoB stated that allergic patients did not report a greater chance of developing OIIRR (OR = 1.17 to 2.10, p = 0.1 to 1), while only one study with low RoB reported that individuals with allergies tend to develop root resorption (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.08-5.37). Three studies with low RoB and one with moderate showed no significant association between asthma and OIIRR (OR = 1.05 to 3.42, p = 0.12 to 0.94). No association was identified between the type of malocclusion and the degree of OIIRR. Uniradicular dental units and a prolonged treatment time seem to be associated with an increased risk of resorption. The certainty of the evidence was considered low for both exposure factors. CONCLUSION: Evidence with a low level of certainty indicates that individuals with allergies or asthma are not more predisposed to OIIRR. Uniradicular teeth and long-term orthodontic treatments are associated with a higher risk of OIIRR.

(preprint),17.42745,2.642161,2021,"Quantitative assessment of the growth of biological organisms has produced many mathematical equations. Many efforts have been given on statistical identification of the correct growth model from experimental data. Every growth equation is unique in terms of mathematical structures; however, one model may serve as a close approximation of the other by appropriate choice of the parameter(s). It is still a challenging problem to select the best estimating model from a set of model equations whose shapes are similar in nature. Our aim in this manuscript is to develop methodology that will reduce the efforts in model selection. This is achieved by utilizing an existing model selection criterion in an innovative way that reduces the number of model fitting exercises substantially. In this manuscript, we have shown that one model can be obtained from the other by choosing a suitable continuous transformation of the parameters. This idea builds an interconnection between many equations which are scattered in the literature. We also get several new growth equations; out of them large number of equations can be obtained from a few key models. Given a set of training data points and the key models, we utilize the idea of interval specific rate parameter (ISRP) proposed by Bhowmick et al (2014) to obtain a suitable mathematical model for the data. The ISRP profile of the parameters of simpler models indicates the nature of variation in parameters with time, thus, enable the experimenter to extrapolate the inference to more complex models. Our proposed methodology significantly reduces the efforts involved in model fitting exercises. The proposed idea is verified by using simulated and real data sets. In addition, theoretical justifications have been provided by investigating the statistical properties of the estimators.","Karim, Md Aktar Ul; Bhagat, Supriya Ramdas; Bhowmick, Amiya Ranjan",,669,33

ARDS patients display elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and innate immune cells, and T and B cell lymphocytes have been implicated in this dysregulated immune response. Mast cells are abundant resident cells of the respiratory tract and are able to release different inflammatory mediators rapidly following stimulation. Recently, mast cells have been associated with tissue damage during viral infections, but their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. In this study, we examined the profile of mast cell activation markers in the serum of COVID-19 patients. We noticed that SARS-CoV-2-infected patients showed increased carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) and decreased serotonin levels in their serum when compared with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. CPA3 levels correlated with C-reactive protein, the number of circulating neutrophils, and quick SOFA. CPA3 in serum was a good biomarker for identifying severe COVID-19 patients, whereas serotonin was a good predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, our results show that serum CPA3 and serotonin levels are relevant biomarkers during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The recent economic downturn resulted not from overleverage and the kind of "" wild west"" behavior observed in the early to mid-2000s, but from the deliberate shut down of the US economy in an effort to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.

Although these studies provide very important information about the causes of CO2 emissions and environmental degradation, some deficiencies remain in the related literature. The agricultural sector activities, which are an important sector at a global level and have significant potential impacts on CO2 emissions, have not been adequately studied. In order to fill this gap, the effects of agriculture and renewable energy on CO2 emissions were examined for lucky-seven countries during the period 1995-2014. The results of panel cointegration reveal the presence of long-run nexus among the variables. While the findings indicate that agriculture increases CO2 emissions, renewable energy is a very important catalyst in reducing CO2 emissions in lucky-seven countries. We also found that economic growth and energy consumption enhance CO2 emissions and trade openness decreases.

Overall, histologically complete resection (R0) was achieved in 77.2% (CI 69.8-83.6%) while histologically proven full-wall excidate was confirmed in 90.0% (CI 85.1-93.7%). Of the resectates obtained (n = 210), 190 were resected en bloc (90.5%). We did not observe a clear improvement of technical success and R0 resection rate over time by the performing endoscopists. Altogether, procedure-related complications were observed in 17.5% (mostly moderate) including 2 cases of acute gangrenous appendicitis requiring operation. DISCUSSION: In this pooled analysis, eFTR represents a feasible, effective, and safe minimally invasive endoscopic technique.","Krutzenbichler, Irmengard; Dollhopf, Markus; Diepolder, Helmut; Eigler, Andreas; Fuchs, Martin; Herrmann, Simon; Kleber, Gerhard; Lewerenz, Björn; Kaiser, Christoph; Lilje, Tilman; Rath, Timo; Agha, Ayman; Vitali, Francesco; Schäfer, Claus; Schepp, Wolfgang; Gundling, Felix",Surg. endosc,669,16

Coronavirus has become an issue of transnational concern. The importance of the media in the coverage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nigeria and its implications among Nigerian populace cannot be overestimated. This study evaluates how Nigerian media depict the coronavirus pandemic and how the depictions shape people's perception and response to the pandemic. Methods: The study employed a quantitative design (newspaper content analysis and questionnaire). The content analysis examines the nature of media coverage of coronavirus in Nigeria and China using four major national newspapers (The Sun, The Vanguard, The Guardian and The Punch). The period of study ranged from January 2020 to March 2020. A total of 1070newspaper items on coronavirus outbreak were identified across the four newspapers and content-analysed. Results: The finding shows that the coverage of the pandemic was dominated by straight news reports accounting for 763 or (71.3%) of all analysed items. This was followed by opinions 169(15.8%), features 120 (11.2%) and editorials 18 (1.7%) respectively. The Punch 309 (28.9%)reported the outbreak more frequently than The Sun 266 (24.9%), The Guardian 258 (24.1%), and Vanguard 237 (22.1%). Finding further suggests that the framing pattern adopted by the newspapers helped Nigerians to take precautionary measures. Conclusion: Continuous reportage of COVID-19 has proved effective in creating awareness about safety and preventive measures thereby helping to 'flatten the curve' and contain the spread of the virus. However, the newspapers should avoid creating fear/panic in reporting the pandemic.","Nwakpu, Ekwutosi Sanita; Ezema, Valentine Okwudilichukwu; Ogbodo, Jude Nwakpoke",Health Promot Perspect,669,0

DESIGN: Multinational network cohort study. SETTING: Hospital electronic health records from the United States, Spain, and China, and nationwide claims data from South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: 303 264 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 from January 2020 to December 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prescriptions or dispensations of any drug on or 30 days after the date of hospital admission for covid-19. RESULTS: Of the 303 264 patients included, 290 131 were from the US, 7599 from South Korea, 5230 from Spain, and 304 from China. 3455 drugs were identified. Common repurposed drugs were hydroxychloroquine (used in from <5 (<2%) patients in China to 2165 (85.1%) in Spain), azithromycin (from 15 (4.9%) in China to 1473 (57.9%) in Spain), combined lopinavir and ritonavir (from 156 (<2%) in the VA-OMOP US to 2,652 (34.9%) in South Korea and 1285 (50.5%) in Spain), and umifenovir (0% in the US, South Korea, and Spain and 238 (78.3%) in China). Use of adjunctive drugs varied greatly, with the five most used treatments being enoxaparin, fluoroquinolones, ceftriaxone, vitamin D, and corticosteroids. Hydroxychloroquine use increased rapidly from March to April 2020 but declined steeply in May to June and remained low for the rest of the year. The use of dexamethasone and corticosteroids increased steadily during 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple drugs were used in the first few months of the covid-19 pandemic, with substantial geographical and temporal variation. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and umifenovir (in China only) were the most prescribed repurposed drugs. Antithrombotics, antibiotics, H2 receptor antagonists, and corticosteroids were often used as adjunctive treatments. Research is needed on the comparative risk and benefit of these treatments in the management of covid-19.","Prats-Uribe, Albert; Sena, Anthony G; Lai, Lana Yin Hui; Ahmed, Waheed-Ul-Rahman; Alghoul, Heba; Alser, Osaid; Alshammari, Thamir M; Areia, Carlos; Carter, William; Casajust, Paula; Dawoud, Dalia; Golozar, Asieh; Jonnagaddala, Jitendra; Mehta, Paras P; Gong, Mengchun; Morales, Daniel R; Nyberg, Fredrik; Posada, Jose D; Recalde, Martina; Roel, Elena; Shah, Karishma; Shah, Nigam H; Schilling, Lisa M; Subbian, Vignesh; Vizcaya, David; Zhang, Lin; Zhang, Ying; Zhu, Hong; Liu, Li; Cho, Jaehyeong; Lynch, Kristine E; Matheny, Michael E; You, Seng Chan; Rijnbeek, Peter R; Hripcsak, George; Lane, Jennifer Ce; Burn, Edward; Reich, Christian; Suchard, Marc A; Duarte-Salles, Talita; Kostka, Kristin; Ryan, Patrick B; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel",BMJ,669,0

We aimed to describe the epidemiology of cardiac arrhythmias in ICU patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study including all ICU patients with an airway sample positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 from March 1st to June 1st in the Capital Region of Denmark (1.8 million inhabitants). We registered cardiac arrhythmias in ICU, potential risk factors, interventions used in ICU and outcomes. RESULTS: From the seven ICUs we included 155 patients with COVID-19. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in the ICU was 57/155 (37%, 95% confidence interval 30-45), and 39/57 (68%) of these patients had this as new-onset arrhythmia. Previous history of tachyarrhythmias and higher disease severity at ICU admission were associated with cardiac arrhythmias in the adjusted analysis. Fifty-four of the 57 (95%) patients had supraventricular origin of the arrhythmia, 39/57 (68%) received at least one intervention against arrhythmia (eg amiodarone, IV fluid or magnesium) and 38/57 (67%) had recurrent episodes of arrhythmia in ICU. Patients with arrhythmias in ICU had higher 60-day mortality (63%) as compared to those without arrhythmias (39%). CONCLUSION: New-onset supraventricular arrhythmias were frequent in ICU patients with COVID-19 and were related to previous history of tachyarrhythmias and severity of the acute disease. The mortality was high in these patients despite the frequent use of interventions against arrhythmias.","Wetterslev, Mik; Jacobsen, Peter Karl; Hassager, Christian; Jøns, Christian; Risum, Niels; Pehrson, Steen; Bastiansen, Anders; Andreasen, Anne Sofie; Tjelle Kristiansen, Klaus; Bestle, Morten H; Mohr, Thomas; Møller-Sørensen, Hasse; Perner, Anders",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,669,22

Guidelines for managing the dead have been issued and implemented by various local administrations, in accordance with national and international guidelines. This questionnaire-based research aims to develop an understanding of the knowledge, perceptions and practices of forensic practitioners from India as regards the management of the dead during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This Pan-India study included 278 forensic medicine experts (249 males and 29 females) working in various hospitals and medical institutions across the country. The questionnaire included various issues involving the management of dead bodies in cases involving coronavirus disease 2019, such as infection control practices, body screening, handling and autopsy, disposal practices, local administrative policies, and available infrastructure and resources. We found that guidelines are mostly being followed across India, barring disparity in issues relating to testing in the dead bodies, the role of local administration in the body disposal, and the use of personal protective equipment while handling bodies and during autopsies.

However, AIS has not been described as a late sequelae in patients without respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. Objective: To assess AIS experienced by adults 50 years or younger in the convalescent phase of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case series prospectively identified consecutive male patients who received care for AIS from public health hospitals in Singapore between May 21, 2020, and October 14, 2020. All of these patients had laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic COVID-19 infection based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 serological (antibodies) test result. These patients were individuals from South Asian countries (India and Bangladesh) who were working in Singapore and living in dormitories. The total number of COVID-19 cases (54 485) in the worker dormitory population was the population at risk. Patients with ongoing respiratory symptoms or positive SARS-CoV-2 serological test results confirmed through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction nasopharyngeal swabs were excluded. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical course, imaging, and laboratory findings were retrieved from the electronic medical records of each participating hospital. The incidence rate of AIS in the case series was compared with that of a historical age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched national cohort. Results: A total of 18 male patients, with a median (range) age of 41 (35-50) years and South Asian ethnicity, were included. The median (range) time from a positive serological test result to AIS was 54.5 (0-130) days. The median (range) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 5 (1-25). Ten patients (56%) presented with a large vessel occlusion, of whom 6 patients underwent intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular therapy. Only 3 patients (17%) had a possible cardiac source of embolus. The estimated annual incidence rate of AIS was 82.6 cases per 100â¯000 people in this study compared with 38.2 cases per 100â¯000 people in the historical age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched cohort (rate ratio, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.36-3.48; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: This case series suggests that the risk for AIS is higher in adults 50 years or younger during the convalescent period of a COVID-19 infection without respiratory symptoms. Acute ischemic stroke could be part of the next wave of complications of COVID-19, and stroke units should be on alert and use serological testing, especially in younger patients or in the absence of traditional risk factors.","Tu, Tian Ming; Seet, Christopher Ying Hao; Koh, Jasmine Shimin; Tham, Carol Huilian; Chiew, Hui Jin; De Leon, Jasmyn Angon; Chua, Christopher Yuan Kit; Hui, Andrew Che-Fai; Tan, Shaun Shi Yan; Vasoo, Shawn Sushilan; Tan, Benjamin Yong-Qiang; Umapathi, N Thirugnanam; Tambyah, Paul Anantharajah; Yeo, Leonard Leong Litt",JAMA Netw Open,669,33

The available data on routine laboratory parameters were collected by routine blood tests before the treatment, at three months, and at the final evaluation. RESULTS: When the changes in routine laboratory parameters were evaluated by treatment, it was found that the NLR and CRP values decreased statistically significantly in the anti-TNF group compared to the IL inhibitor group. In addition, strong suppression of these inflammation parameters means strong suppression of the immune system response. In addition, AST, ALT, and creatinine values were found to be statistically significantly higher in the anti-TNF group compared to the IL inhibitor group. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, anti-TNF treatments are shown to be more effective in reducing inflammation parameters while IL antagonists are safer in terms of biochemical parameters.","Ataseven, Arzu; Temiz, Selami Aykut; Eren, Güllü; Özer, Ilkay; Dursun, Recep",J Dermatolog Treat,669,30

Both aging and diseases of inflammaging are associated with severe COVID-19 disease, and a dysfunctional thymus may be a predisposing factor. In addition, insults on the thymus during childhood may lead to abnormal thymic function and may explain severe COVID-19 disease among younger individuals; therefore, measurement of thymic function may assist COVID-19 care.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) or camostat mesylate administered within 72 h of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult individuals with pre-existing risk factors at higher risk of getting seriously ill with COVID-19. Camostat mesylate acts as an inhibitor of the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2 and prevents the virus from entering the cell. CP represents another antiviral strategy in terms of passive immunization. The working hypothesis to be tested in the RES-Q-HR study is that the early use of CP or camostat mesylate reduces the likelihood of disease progression to (modified) WHO stages 4b-8 in SARS-CoV-2-positive adult patients at high risk of moderate or severe COVID-19 progression. TRIAL DESIGN: This study is a 4-arm (parallel group), multicenter, randomized (2:2:1:1 ratio), partly double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) or camostat mesylate with control or placebo in adult patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and high risk for progression to moderate/severe COVID-19. Superiority of the intervention arms will be tested. PARTICIPANTS: The trial is conducted at 10-15 tertiary care centers in Germany.

Patients with organ or bone marrow transplant in the three months prior to screening visit INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomized to the following 4 groups: 1) Convalescent plasma (CP), 2 units at screening/baseline visit (day 0) or day 1; CP is defined by the presence of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with titers &#8805; 1:160; individuals with body weight &#8805; 150 kg will receive a third unit of plasma on day 3 2) Camostat mesylate (200 mg per capsule, one capsule taken each in the morning, afternoon and evening on days 1-7) 3) Standard of care (SOC, control for CP) 4) Placebo (identical in appearance to camostat mesylate capsules, one capsule taken each morning, afternoon and evening on days 1-7; for camostat mesylate control group) Participants will be monitored after screening/baseline on day 3, day 5, day 8, and day 14. On day 28 and day 56, telephone visits and on day 90, another outpatient visit are scheduled. Adverse events and serious adverse events will be monitored and reported until the end of the study. An independent data safety monitoring committee will review trial progression and safety. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint of the study is the cumulative number of individuals who progress to or beyond category 4b on the modified WHO COVID-19 ordinal scale (defined as hospitalization with COVID-19 pneumonia and additional oxygen demand via nasal cannula or mask) within 28 days after randomization. RANDOMIZATION: Participants will be randomized using the Alea-Tool ( aleaclinical.com ) in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to the treatment arms (1) CP, (2) camostat mesylate, (3) standard of care (SoC), and (4) placebo matching camostat mesylate. Randomization will be stratified by study center. BLINDING (MASKING): The camostat mesylate treatment arm and the respective placebo will be blinded for participants, caregivers, and those assessing outcomes. The treatment arms convalescent plasma and standard of care will not be blinded and thus are open-labeled, unblinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): Overall, n = 994 participants will be randomized to the following groups: n = 331 to convalescent plasma (CP), n = 331 to camostat mesylate, n = 166 to standard of care (SoC), and n = 166 to placebo matching camostat mesylate.

This reactivation is orchestrated by the interplay of sleep slow oscillations, spindles, and theta, which are in turn modulated by certain neurotransmitters like GABA to enable long-lasting plastic changes in the memory store. Here we asked whether the GABAergic system and associated changes in sleep oscillations are functionally related to memory reactivation during sleep. We administered the GABAA agonist zolpidem (10 mg) in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. To specifically focus on the effects on memory reactivation during sleep, we experimentally induced such reactivations by targeted memory reactivation (TMR) with learning-associated reminder cues presented during post-learning slow-wave sleep (SWS). Zolpidem significantly enhanced memory performance with TMR during sleep compared with placebo. Zolpidem also increased the coupling of fast spindles and theta to slow oscillations, although overall the power of slow spindles and theta was reduced compared with placebo. In an uncorrected exploratory analysis, memory performance was associated with slow spindle responses to TMR in the zolpidem condition, whereas it was associated with fast spindle responses in placebo. These findings provide tentative first evidence that GABAergic activity may be functionally implicated in memory reactivation processes during sleep, possibly via its effects on slow oscillations, spindles and theta as well as their interplay.","Carbone, Julia; Bibián, Carlos; Reischl, Patrick; Born, Jan; Forcato, Cecilia; Diekelmann, Susanne",Learn Mem,669,1

This review aims to summarize the incidence, risk factors, possible pathophysiology, and proposed management of neurological manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or neuro-PASC based on the published literature. RECENT FINDINGS: The National Institutes of Health has noted that PASC is a multi-organ disorder ranging from mild symptoms to an incapacitating state that can last for weeks or longer following recovery from initial infection with SARS-CoV-2. Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed as the culprit for the development of PASC. These include, but are not limited to, direct or indirect invasion of the virus into the brain, immune dysregulation, hormonal disturbances, elevated cytokine levels due to immune reaction leading to chronic inflammation, direct tissue damage to other organs, and persistent low-grade infection. A multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of neuro-PASC will be required to diagnose and address these symptoms. Tailored rehabilitation and novel cognitive therapy protocols are as important as pharmacological treatments to treat neuro-PASC effectively. With recognizing the growing numbers of COVID-19 patients suffering from neuro-PASC, there is an urgent need to identify affected individuals early to provide the most appropriate and efficient treatments. Awareness among the general population and health care professionals about PASC is rising, and more efforts are needed to understand and treat this new emerging challenge. In this review, we summarize the relevant scientific literature about neuro-PASC.","Moghimi, Narges; Di Napoli, Mario; Biller, José; Siegler, James E; Shekhar, Rahul; McCullough, Louise D; Harkins, Michelle S; Hong, Emily; Alaouieh, Danielle A; Mansueto, Gelsomina; Divani, Afshin A",Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,669,24

Although controlled transmission is crucial, further investigation into air quality traits that contribute to the lethality of COVID-19 in infected persons enables risk stratification and optimization of the allocation of resources. There is a need for a valid basis for the proactive identification of indicators of COVID-19 severity in air quality that allow for the implementation of systematic environmental improvements aimed at preventing COVID-19 mortality. In this paper, chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM) is identified as a source of disrupted activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; it is therefore, a contributable variable to COVID-19 mortality.","Deek, Sarah A",Med Hypotheses,669,1

We aimed to assess analytical and diagnostic performance of 8 (semi-)quantitative assays detecting anti-nucleocapsid IgG (Euroimmun, Id-Vet) or total Ig (Roche), anti-spike protein IgG (Euroimmun, Theradiag, DiaSorin, Thermo Fisher) or both (Theradiag) and 2 rapid lateral flow assays (LFA) (AAZ-LMB and Theradiag). METHODS: Specificity was evaluated using a cross-reactivity panel of 85 pre-pandemic serum samples. Sensitivity was determined at both the manufacturer's and a 95% specificity cut-off level, using 81 serum samples of patients with a positive rRT-PCR. Sensitivity was determined in function of time post symptoms onset. RESULTS: Specificity for all assays ranged from 92.9% to 100% (Roche and Thermo Fisher) with the exception of the Theradiag IgM LFA (82.4%). Sensitivity in asymptomatic patients ranged between 41.7% and 58.3%. Sensitivity on samples taken <10 days since symptom onset was low (23.3%-66.7%) and increased on samples taken between 10 and 20 days and > 20 days since symptom onset (80%-96% and 92.9%-100%, respectively). From 20 days after symptom onset, the Roche, Id-vet and Thermo Fisher assays all met the sensitivity (>95%) and specificity (>97%) targets determined by the WHO. Antibody signal response was significantly higher in the critically ill patient group. CONCLUSION: Antibody detection can complement rRT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19, especially in the later stage, or in asymptomatic patients for epidemiological purposes. Addition of IgM in LFAs did not improve sensitivity.","Mylemans, Marnix; Van Honacker, Eveline; Nevejan, Louis; Van Den Bremt, Stefanie; Hofman, Laura; Poels, Jeroen; Cattoir, Lien; Boel, An; Van Hoovels, Lieve",J Immunol Methods,669,1

Nowadays, no efficacious therapy is available, and vaccines and drugs are underdeveloped to cure or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in many countries. Some vaccines candidates have been approved; however, a number of people are still skeptical of this coronavirus vaccines. Probably because of issues related to the quantity of the vaccine and a possible long-term side effects which are still being studied.

Stock markets and the significance of the COVID-19 pandemic,17.136765,2.6390657,2021,"Bats are primary reservoirs for multiple lethal human viruses, such as Ebola, Nipah, Hendra, rabies, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, most recently, SARS-CoV-2. The innate immune systems of these immensely abundant, anciently diverged mammals remain insufficiently characterized. While bat genomes contain many endogenous retroviral elements indicative of past exogenous infections, little is known about restrictions to extant retroviruses. Here, we describe a major postentry restriction in cells of the yinpterochiropteran bat Pteropus alecto Primate lentiviruses (HIV-1, SIVmac) were potently blocked at early life cycle steps, with up to 1,000-fold decreases in infectivity. The block was specific, because nonprimate lentiviruses such as equine infectious anemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus were unimpaired, as were foamy retroviruses. Interspecies heterokaryons demonstrated a dominant block consistent with restriction of incoming viruses. Several features suggested potential TRIM5 (tripartite motif 5) or myxovirus resistance protein 2 (MX2) protein restriction, including postentry action, cyclosporine sensitivity, and reversal by capsid cyclophilin A (CypA) binding loop mutations. Viral nuclear import was significantly reduced, and this deficit was substantially rescued by cyclosporine treatment. However, saturation with HIV-1 virus-like particles did not relieve the restriction at all. P. alecto TRIM5 was inactive against HIV-1 although it blocked the gammaretrovirus N-tropic murine leukemia virus. Despite major divergence in a critical N-terminal motif required for human MX2 activity, P. alecto MX2 had anti-HIV activity. However, this did not quantitatively account for the restriction and was independent of and synergistic with an additional CypA-dependent restriction. These results reveal a novel, specific restriction to primate lentiviruses in the Pteropodidae and advance understanding of bat innate immunity.IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic suggests that bat innate immune systems are insufficiently characterized relative to the medical importance of these animals. Retroviruses, e.g., HIV-1, can be severe pathogens when they cross species barriers, and bat restrictions corresponding to retroviruses are comparatively unstudied. Here, we compared the abilities of retroviruses from three genera (Lentivirus, Gammaretrovirus, and Spumavirus) to infect cells of the large fruit-eating bat P. alecto and other mammals. We identified a major, specific postentry restriction to primate lentiviruses. HIV-1 and SIVmac are potently blocked at early life cycle steps, but nonprimate lentiviruses and foamy retroviruses are entirely unrestricted. Despite acting postentry and in a CypA-dependent manner with features reminiscent of antiretroviral factors from other mammals, this restriction was not saturable with virus-like particles and was independent of P. alecto TRIM5, TRIM21, TRIM22, TRIM34, and MX2. These results identify a novel restriction and highlight cyclophilin-capsid interactions as ancient species-specific determinants of retroviral infection.","Morrison, James H; Miller, Caitlin; Bankers, Laura; Crameri, Gary; Wang, Lin-Fa; Poeschla, Eric M",mBio (Online),669,1

Emerging adulthood is a developmental phase wherein individuals experience unique vulnerability to the development of psychopathology given their exposure to repeated stressors and their disruptions in routine, making them a population worthy of investigation. OBJECTIVE: This prospective study aims to leverage multimodal assessments to examine the feasibility of an individualized approach to understanding contextual factors relevant to changes in daily affect, sleep, physiology, and activities in the service of using event mining to predict changes in mental health. METHODS: Recruited participants (expected final N = 20) will be monitored for a period of time (between 3 and 12 months). Participants will download the Personicle application on their smartphone to track activities (e.g., home events, cycling) and be given wearable sensor devices to wear continuously (monitors sleep, physiology, and physical activity). They will be asked to report daily mood and complete weekly open-ended text responses as well as a battery of questionnaires every 3 months. RESULTS: Our study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board and is currently undergoing data collection. Adjustments were made due to the COVID-19 pandemic to enable remote data collection and assess for COVID-19-related stress.

Objective: To investigate the association between ACEIs/ARBs and severity of illness and mortality in patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 1178 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 15 to March 15, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and epidemiologic, clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and drug therapy data were analyzed in all patients. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs was compared between those with severe vs nonsevere illness and between survivors vs nonsurvivors. Results: Of the 1178 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.5 years (interquartile range, 38-67 years) and 545 (46.3%) were men. The overall in-hospital mortality was 11.0%. There were 362 patients with hypertension (30.7% of the total group; median age, 66.0 years [interquartile range, 59-73 years]; 189 [52.2%] were men), of whom 115 (31.8%) were taking ACEI/ARBs. The in-hospital mortality in the patients with hypertension was 21.3%. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs did not differ between those with severe and nonsevere infections (32.9% vs 30.7%; P = .65) nor did it differ between nonsurvivors and survivors (27.3% vs 33.0%; P = .34). Similar findings were observed when data were analyzed for patients taking ACEIs and those taking ARBs. Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides clinical data on the association between ACEIs/ARBs and outcomes in patients with hypertension hospitalized with COVID-19 infections, suggesting that ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19 in such patients.

Several patients with severe COVID-19 infection can develop a coagulopathy according to the ISTH criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) with fulminant activation of coagulation, resulting in widespread microvascular thrombosis and consumption of coagulation factors. We conducted a meta-analysis in order to explore differences in coagulopathy indices in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. An electronic search was performed within PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus electronic databases between December 2019 (first confirmed Covid-19 case) up to April 6th, 2020. The primary endpoint was the difference of D-dimer values between Non-Severe vs Severe disease and Survivors vs Non-Survivors. Furthermore, results on additional coagulation parameters (platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time) were also analyzed. The primary analysis showed that mean d-dimer was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with non-severe disease than in those with severe (SMD - 2.15 [- 2.73 to - 1.56], I2 98%, P < 0.0001). Similarly, we found a lower mean d-dimer in Survivors compared to Non-Survivors (SMD - 2.91 [- 3.87 to - 1.96], I2 98%, P < 0.0001). Additional analysis of platelet count showed higher levels of mean PLT in Non-Severe patients than those observed in the Severe group (SMD 0.77 [0.32 to 1.22], I2 96%, P < 0.001). Of note, a similar result was observed even when Survivors were compared to Non-Survivors (SMD 1.84 [1.16 to 2.53], I2 97%, P < 0.0001). Interestingly, shorter mean PT was found in both Non-Severe (SMD - 1.34 [- 2.06 to - 0.62], I2 98%, P < 0.0002) and Survivors groups (SMD - 1.61 [- 2.69 to - 0.54], I2 98%, P < 0.003) compared to Severe and Non-Survivor patients. In conclusion, the results of the present meta-analysis demonstrate that Severe COVID-19 infection is associated with higher D-dimer values, lower platelet count and prolonged PT. This data suggests a possible role of disseminated intravascular coagulation in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease complications.","Polimeni, Alberto; Leo, Isabella; Spaccarotella, Carmen; Mongiardo, Annalisa; Sorrentino, Sabato; Sabatino, Jolanda; De Rosa, Salvatore; Indolfi, Ciro",Sci Rep,669,14

However, available data cannot clearly characterize the correlation between cardiac injury and COVID-19. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of recent studies to 1) explore the prevalence of cardiac injury in different types of COVID-19 patients and 2) evaluate the association between cardiac injury and worse prognosis (severe disease, admission to ICU, and mortality) in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Literature search was conducted through PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and MedRxiv databases. A meta-analysis was performed with Stata 14.0. A fixed-effects model was used if the I2 values &#8804; 50%, otherwise the random-effects model was performed. The prevalence of cardiac injury was 19% (95% CI: 0.15-0.22, and p < 0.001) in total COVID-19 patients, 36% (95% CI: 0.25-0.47, and p < 0.001) in severe COVID-19 patients, and 48% (95% CI: 0.30-0.66, and p < 0.001) in non-survivors. Furthermore, cardiac injury was found to be associated with a significant increase in the risk of poor outcomes with a pooled effect size (ES) of 8.46 (95% CI: 3.76-19.06, and p = 0.062), severe disease with an ES of 3.54 (95% CI: 2.25-5.58, and p < 0.001), admission to ICU with an ES of 5.03 (95% CI: 2.69-9.39, and p < 0.001), and mortality with an ES of 4.99 (95% CI: 3.38-7.37, and p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of cardiac injury was greatly increased in COVID-19 patients, particularly in patients with severe disease and non-survivors. COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury are more likely to be associated with poor outcomes, severity of disease, admission to ICU, and mortality.","Huang, Zhen; Huang, Pan; Du, Binbin; Kong, Lingyao; Zhang, Wenyuan; Zhang, Yanzhou; Dong, Jianzeng",Nutr. metab. cardiovasc. dis,669,16

Although person-to-person transmission of the etiologic agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been confirmed, it is not known whether COVID-19 may be transmitted by blood transfusion. Notwithstanding the urgent requirement of blood, it is critical to know whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted by blood transfusion because many individuals may be asymptomatic carriers and may donate blood. Several cases in which specific viral RNA could be detected in the serum from patients with COVID-19 have already been reported; these findings suggest that blood donation may be an unexplored route of transmission. However, the American Association of Blood Banks and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not recommended any specific SARS-CoV-2-related actions to be taken at blood collection centres at this time. In this report, we describe a case of a 21-year-old man with very severe aplastic anaemia who received apheresis platelet transfusion from an individual who was subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19.

This study aimed to further confirm the relationship between different blood groups on the vulnerability, symptoms, cure period, and severity among COVID-19 recovered patients. Subjects and Methods: This cross-sectional study approached the participants from the Arab community via social media (mainly Facebook and WhatsApp). The data were collected through two Google Form questionnaires, one for COVID-19 recovered patients (COVID-19 group, n = 726), and the other for the healthy people (Control group, n = 707). Results: The subjects with blood group O were the least likely to be infected with the COVID-19 virus, while those with blood group A were not likely to be the most susceptible. There were significant differences among different ABO blood groups regarding the distribution of oxygen saturation percentage, myalgia, and recovery time after COVID-19 infection (p < 0.01, 0.01, and 0.05, respectively). The blood group A showed the highest percentage of patients who experienced an oxygen saturation range of 90-100%, whereas the blood group O showed the highest percentage of patients who experienced an oxygen saturation range of 70-80%. The blood group A showed the lowest percentage of patients who required artificial respiration, whereas the blood group O showed the highest percentage of patients who required artificial respiration. The blood group B showed the lowest percentage of patients who experienced myalgia and exhibited the lowest percentage of patients who needed 3 weeks or more to recover. Conclusion: The people of blood group O may be the least likely to be infected with COVID-19, however, they may be the more in need of treatment in hospital and artificial respiration compared to the other blood groups.","El-Shitany, Nagla A; El-Hamamsy, Manal; Alahmadi, Ahlam A; Eid, Basma G; Neamatallah, Thikryat; Almukadi, Haifa S; Arab, Rana A; Faddladdeen, Khadija A; Al-Sulami, Khayria A; Bahshwan, Safia M; Ali, Soad S; Harakeh, Steve; Badr-Eldin, Shaimaa M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),669,20

This study explored the independent and combined effects of the COVID-19 and economy-related variables on stress and anxiety among Lebanese adults in a developing country facing a severe socio-economic crisis and political turmoil. A cross-sectional study was conducted online between May 10 and 20, 2020, using the snowball sampling technique. All individuals over 18 were eligible. The final sample included 502 respondents. Higher stress and anxiety were associated with younger age, female gender, previous higher socio-economic status, having a family member with a chronic disease, fear of not getting access to treatment, fear of COVID-19, and physical violence at home. However, financial wellness and higher family satisfaction were significantly associated with lower stress. The multivariate analysis showed a significant interaction between fear of COVID-19 and financial wellness on estimated marginal means of stress and anxiety. The combined presence of fear of the pandemic and financial hardship is associated with higher stress and anxiety, particularly among women and younger Lebanese adults with difficult home circumstances. Thus, healthcare professionals need to screen for mental health problems among subgroups presenting multiple risk factors.","Salameh, Pascale; Hajj, Aline; Badro, Danielle A; Abou Selwan, Carla; Aoun, Randa; Sacre, Hala",Psychiatry Res,669,23

Historically, the bronchoscopist is accompanied with a technician and a nurse for the procedure. Fear of increasing personnel exposure has been concerning. We present our protocol to prevent exposure during bronchoscopy.Methods:Patients with COVID-19, on mechanical ventilation requiring bronchoscopy were selected between March 2020 and October 2020. Instead of having the whole bronchoscopy team involved, and need for decontamination of equipment post procedure, a disposable bronchoscope was used, and the bronchoscopist was the only person to perform the procedure.Results:A total of 94 bronchoscopies were performed mostly for the evaluation of non-resolving or worsening infiltrates and respiratory failure. All procedures were completed with a single operator in the room, and the use of topical anesthesia through the ETT. The procedure time was less than five minutes, there was no desaturation, no immediate complications, and all procedures were performed with the recommended safety precautions including masks and contact protection garment. Importantly, there was no operator conversion to positive COVID-19 status.Conclusion:we conclude that in patients with Covid-19 receiving mechanical ventilation, oneperson bronchoscopy procedure is highly effective, safe and decreases staff exposure to COVID-19 .","Bechara, R.

The aim of the current study was to determine the needs and concerns of Black communities in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and to highlight the importance of collecting race-based COVID-19 data early on to address these needs. METHODS: Six qualitative interviews were conducted with local community health centre leaders who serve a high population of racialized communities within the GTA. Content analysis was used to extract the main themes and concerns raised during the interviews. RESULTS: The findings from this study provide further evidence of the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has had on Black and other racialized communities. Difficulty self-isolating due to overcrowded housing, food insecurity, and less social support for seniors were concerns identified by community health leaders. Also, enhanced financial support for front-line workers, such as Personal Support Workers (PSWs), was an important concern raised. In order to lessen the impact of the pandemic on these communities, leaders noted the need for greater accessibility of testing centres in these areas and a greater investment in tailored health promotion approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings point to the importance of collecting race-based data to ensure an equitable response to the pandemic. The current ""one size fits all"" response is not effective for all individuals, especially Black communities. Not all populations have access to the same resources, nor do they live in the same conditions (Kantamneni, J Vocal Behav 119:103439, 2020). A deeper consideration of the social determinants of health are needed when implementing COVID-19 policies and responses. Also, a lack of attention to Black communities only continues to perpetuate the under-acknowledged issue of anti-Black racism prevalent in Canada.","Ahmed, R.; Jamal, O.; Ishak, W.; Nabi, K.; Mustafa, N.",Tropical Diseases Travel Medicine &amp; Vaccines,669,16

Therefore, the main intent of this study was to estimate the prevalence of trauma among young adults exposed to violent and stressful events of armed conflict. Method: This was a cross-sectional study conducted on the prevalence of trauma in all the 10 districts of Kashmir Valley using multistage sampling technique. Data were collected from 693 students by means of the Demographic Information Questionnaire and Kashmir Conflict Exposure Checklist (KCEC). Results: Findings revealed that one third of the respondents were exposed to high traumatic exposure (33.3%), close to quarter of the participants reported extremely high traumatic exposure (23.7%), over one third of the respondents were exposed to moderate traumatic exposure (33.5%), and about one tenth of the sample were exposed to low traumatic exposure (9.5%) in the context of the Kashmir conflict. The prevalence of trauma was 100% in both males and females. The traumatic events with highest rate of prevalence were ""feeling stressed"" (97.3%), followed by ""fear of search operations, crackdowns or curfews"" (89.2%); ""witnessing a protest or being part of it"" (88.3%); ""a family member, relative or friend being hit with a bullet, pellet, or any other explosive"" (76.5%); and ""exposure to violent media portrayals"" (74.3%). Thirteen of 17 traumatic events were significantly associated with gender wherein males reported significantly higher prevalence in all of these events than females, except one. Conclusions: The findings of the current study revealed a very disturbing picture regarding the prevalence of traumatic experience of Kashmiri young adults and recommends that educational institutions and nongovernment organizations in Kashmir should pay attention toward guiding the young adults of Kashmir in the right direction for their growth, safety, and welfare, in addition to providing mental health support services, to enhance psychological competence, prevent the development of psychiatric disorders, and utilize the potentials of youth for nation building.

Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity increase the chances of fatal disease, but they alone do not explain why age is an independent risk factor. Here, we present the molecular differences between young, middle-aged and older people that may explain why COVID-19 is a mild illness in some but life-threatening in others. We also discuss several biological age clocks that could be used in conjunction with genetic tests to identify both the mechanisms of the disease and individuals most at risk. Finally, based on these mechanisms, we discuss treatments that could increase the survival of older people, not simply by inhibiting the virus, but by restoring patients' ability to clear the infection and effectively regulate immune responses.","Mueller, Amber L; McNamara, Maeve S; Sinclair, David A",Aging (Albany NY),669,1

A few reports have showed that mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 is higher in elderly patients and other active comorbidities including cancer. To date, no effective treatment has been identified and management for critically ill patients relies on management in intensive care units. Patients with lung cancer are at risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19. Furthermore, the use of chemotherapy might have a negative impact in patient's outcome. Therefore, the risk/benefit ratio of systemic anticancer treatment (SACT) has to be considered. For each patient, several factors including age and comorbidities, as well as the number of hospital visits for treatment, can influence this risk. Each hospital around the world has issued some internal policy guidelines for oncologists, aiming to limit risks during this difficult time. We hereby propose a tool to support oncologists and physicians in treatment decision for patients with lung cancer. There are several variables to consider, including the extent of the epidemic, the local healthcare structure capacity, the risk of infection to the individual, the status of cancer, patients' comorbidities, age and details of the treatment. Given this heterogeneity, we have based our suggestions bearing in mind some general factors There is not easy, universal solution to oncological care during this crisis and, to complicate matters, the duration of this pandemic is hard to predict.

However, uncertainty remains around several details regarding face masks, including the potential for transmission of bioaerosols depending on the type of mask and secondary spread by face masks. Thus, understanding the interplay between face mask structure and harmful bioaerosols is essential for protecting public health. Here, we evaluated the microbial survival rate at each layer of commercial of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and surgical masks (SMs) using bacterial bioaerosols. The penetration efficiency of bacterial particles for FFRs was lower than that for SMs; however, the microbial survival rate for all tested masks was >13%, regardless of filtration performance. Most bacterial particles survived in the filter layer (44%-77%) (e.g., the core filtering layer); the outer layer also exhibited significant survival rates (18%-29%). Most notably, survival rates were determined for the inner layers (<1% for FFRs, 3%-16% for SMs), which are in contact with the respiratory tract. Our comparisons of the permeability and survival rate of bioaerosols in each layer will contribute to bioaerosol-face mask research, while also providing information to facilitate the establishment of a mask-reuse protocol.","Jeong, Sang Bin; Heo, Ki Joon; Ko, Hyun Sik; Ahn, Jae Pyoung; Lee, Seung-Bok; Jung, Jae Hee",Indoor air,669,14

Reported cognitive assessment is often limited to orientation alone. Further assessment may seem an inappropriate burden in acute COVID-19 cases characterized by fatigue and confusion as well as examiner safety. OBJECTIVE: Objective: To assess cognition in COVID-19 cases as comprehensively as possible in a brief format, all while observing safety; and to establish clear-face value of its external validity. METHODS: Method: We adapted a brief cognitive assessment, previously applied to liver transplant candidates and medical/surgical inpatients, for remote use in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment. Collecting quality assurance data from telephone-administered assessments, this report presents a series of six COVID-19 case vignettes to illustrate the 5-Minute Assessment use in diagnosis and treatment of brain effects. Primary medical teams referred the cases for neuropsychiatric consultation. RESULTS: Results: Varying over four decades in age, none were able to engage meaningfully with their surroundings on admission. On follow-up exam 6 to 10 days later, four of the six had recovered Working Memory, and only one had recovered calculation ability. Two were capable of complex Judgment responses while none of the cases completed frontal executive function testing in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: Cognitive assessment in COVID-19 cases, using this remote examination, reveals patterns of cognitive recovery that vary among cases and are far more complex than loss of orientation. In this series, testing specific temporal, parietal, and three frontal lobe functions suggests that calculation ability, judgment, and especially frontal executive functions, may characterize COVID-19 brain effects. Used widely, and serially, this exam method can potentially inform our understanding of COVID-19 brain effects with healing from the virus.

COVID-19 has cost many human lives and created an enormous economic burden. Although many drugs/vaccines are in different stages of clinical trials, still none is clinically available. We have screened a marine seaweed database (1110 compounds) against 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 using computational approaches. High throughput virtual screening was performed on compounds, and 86 of them with docking score < - 5.000 kcal mol-1 were subjected to standard-precision docking. Based on binding energies (< - 6.000 kcal mol-1), 9 compounds were further shortlisted and subjected to extra-precision docking. Free energy calculation by Prime-MM/GBSA suggested RC002, GA004, and GA006 as the most potent inhibitors of 3CLpro. An analysis of ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties of RC002, GA004, and GA006 indicated that only RC002 (callophysin A, from red alga Callophycus oppositifolius) passed Lipinski's, Veber's, PAINS and Brenk's filters and displayed drug-like and lead-like properties. Analysis of 3CLpro-callophysin A complex revealed the involvement of salt bridge, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. callophysin A interacted with the catalytic residues (His41 and Cys145) of 3CLpro; hence it may act as a mechanism-based competitive inhibitor. Docking energy and docking affinity of callophysin A towards 3CLpro was - 8.776 kcal mol-1 and 2.73 × 106 M-1, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the stability of the 3CLpro-callophysin A complex. The findings of this study may serve as the basis for further validation by in vitro and in vivo studies.","Muteeb, Ghazala; Alshoaibi, Adil; Aatif, Mohammad; Rehman, Md Tabish; Qayyum, M Zuhaib",Appl Biol Chem,669,20

METHODS: The study was conducted from June 1st to June 14th, 2020. All the recommended national and international indications on infection control measures were followed. Two hundred and three HCWs were included in the study and tested by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and rapid serological test (RST). Descriptive statistical analyses were used to summarize the data. RESULTS: Of the 203 HCWs, 29 (14.3 %) tested positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thirty-seven (18.2 %) HCWs tested positive with RST: 20 with both IgM and IgG; 14 with IgM only, and 3 with IgG only. Age, gender, and/or occupation were not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Point prevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic HCWs in ED of tertiary care facility is 14.3 % by RT-PCR.

DESIGN.: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING.: ICU of an academic county hospital in Los Angeles, CA admitted from March 15-June 20, 2020. PATIENTS.: 77 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. 75 patients met inclusion criteria. RESULTS.: 21% of patients with severe COVID-19 sustained barotrauma (33% of patients receiving IMV, 8% of patients receiving (NIV). There were no differences between the barotrauma and non-barotrauma groups regarding demographics, illness severity, or medications received, nor tidal volume or average/peak airway pressures in those receiving IMV. In the barotrauma group there was a greater proportion of patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (81% vs. 47%, p = 0.023) and ventilated using airway pressure release ventilation mode (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.043). Barotrauma was associated with increased likelihood of receiving a tracheostomy (OR 2.58 [0.23-4.9], p = 0.018]), longer median ICU length of stay (17 days vs. 7 days, p = 0.03), and longer median length of hospitalization (26 days vs. 14 days, p < 0.001). There was also a trend toward prolonged median duration of IMV (12.5 days vs 7 days, p = 0.13) and higher average mortality (56% vs 37%, p = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS.: Barotrauma is seen in 5-12% of patients with ARDS receiving IMV and is exceedingly rare in patients receiving NIV. We report a high incidence of barotrauma observed in critically ill patients with COVID-19 requiring either NIV or IMV. While there was a trend toward increased mortality in patients with barotrauma, this did not reach statistical significance. The increased incidence of barotrauma with COVID-19 may be a product of the pathophysiology of this disease state and a heightened inflammatory response causing rampant acute lung injury.

Surprisingly, many do not take advantage of existing methods to increase security and reliability. Analyzing 1,388 Alerting Authorities, backed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), we are alarmed by three major findings. First, 50% of the domain names are registered under generic top-level domains, which simplifies phishing. Second, only 8% of the domain names are secured by DNSSEC and about 15% of all hosts fail to provide valid certificates.

This is a single-center observational retrospective study that included 29 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the San Matteo Hospital Foundation between February and May 2020, with a diagnosis of PE, and a control population of 23 non-COVID-19 patients admitted at our hospital during the same time lapse in 2019. We calculated the patient-related delay (i.e., the time between the onset of the symptoms and the first medical examination), and the physician-related delay (i.e., the time between the first medical examination and the diagnosis of PE). The overall diagnostic delay significantly correlated with the physician-related delay (p &lt; 0.0001), with the tendency to a worse outcome in long physician-related diagnostic delay (p = 0.04). The delay was related to the presence of fever, respiratory symptoms and high levels of lactate dehydrogenase.

One reason is that the challenges underneath sequencing SARS-CoV-2 directly from clinical samples have not been completely tackled, i.e., sequencing samples with low viral load often results in insufficient viral reads for analyses. METHODS: We applied a novel multiplex PCR amplicon (amplicon)-based and hybrid capture (capture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual variations of SARS-CoV-2 from serials dilutions of a cultured isolate, and eight clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral loads. We also examined and compared the sensitivity, accuracy, and other characteristics of these approaches in a comprehensive manner. RESULTS: We demonstrated that both amplicon and capture methods efficiently enriched SARS-CoV-2 content from clinical samples, while the enrichment efficiency of amplicon outran that of capture in more challenging samples. We found that capture was not as accurate as meta and amplicon in identifying between-sample variations, whereas amplicon method was not as accurate as the other two in investigating within-sample variations, suggesting amplicon sequencing was not suitable for studying virus-host interactions and viral transmission that heavily rely on intra-host dynamics. We illustrated that meta uncovered rich genetic information in the clinical samples besides SARS-CoV-2, providing references for clinical diagnostics and therapeutics. Taken all factors above and cost-effectiveness into consideration, we proposed guidance for how to choose sequencing strategy for SARS-CoV-2 under different situations. CONCLUSIONS: This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work systematically investigating inter- and intra-individual variations of SARS-CoV-2 using amplicon- and capture-based whole-genome sequencing, as well as the first comparative study among multiple approaches. Our work offers practical solutions for genome sequencing and analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viruses.","Xiao, Minfeng; Liu, Xiaoqing; Ji, Jingkai; Li, Min; Li, Jiandong; Yang, Lin; Sun, Wanying; Ren, Peidi; Yang, Guifang; Zhao, Jincun; Liang, Tianzhu; Ren, Huahui; Chen, Tian; Zhong, Huanzi; Song, Wenchen; Wang, Yanqun; Deng, Ziqing; Zhao, Yanping; Ou, Zhihua; Wang, Daxi; Cai, Jielun; Cheng, Xinyi; Feng, Taiqing; Wu, Honglong; Gong, Yanping; Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jian; Xu, Xun; Zhu, Shida; Chen, Fang; Zhang, Yanyan; Chen, Weijun; Li, Yimin; Li, Junhua",Genome Med,669,24

SOR Model Perspective,17.114319,2.5785618,2021,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Nursing home (NH) residents are a vulnerable population, susceptible to respiratory disease outbreaks such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Poor outcome in COVID-19 is at least partly attributed to hypercoagulability, resulting in a high incidence of thromboembolic complications. It is unknown whether commonly used antithrombotic therapies may protect the vulnerable NH population with COVID-19 against mortality. This study aimed to investigate whether the use of oral antithrombotic therapy (OAT) was associated with a lower mortality in NH residents with COVID-19. DESIGN: A retrospective case series. SETTING: Fourteen NH facilities from the NH organization Envida, Maastricht, the Netherlands PARTICIPANTS: A total of 101 NH residents with COVID-19 were enrolled. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The association between age, sex, comorbidity, OAT, and mortality was assessed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall mortality was 47.5% in NH residents from 14 NH facilities. Age, comorbidity, and medication use were comparable among NH residents who survived and who died. OAT was associated with a lower mortality in NH residents with COVID-19 in the univariable analysis (odds ratio (OR) = 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.41-1.95). However, additional adjustments for sex, age, and comorbidity attenuated this difference. Mortality in males was higher compared with female residents (OR = 3.96; 95% CI = 1.62-9.65). Male residents who died were younger compared with female residents (82.2 (standard deviation (SD) = 6.3) vs 89.1 (SD = 6.8) years; P < .001). CONCLUSION: NH residents in the 14 facilities we studied were severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a mortality of 47.5%. Male NH residents with COVID-19 had worse outcomes than females. We did not find evidence for any protection against mortality by OAT, necessitating further research into strategies to mitigate poor outcome of COVID-19 in vulnerable NH populations.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to HV-KP is uncommon and details of its clinical and microbiological features are limited. We report the first case of CAP due to capsular genotype K2-ST86 HV-KP in Okinawa, Japan and review infections caused by the K2-ST86 strain. A 79-year-old woman presenting with fever and productive cough persisting for the past three days was admitted to hospital. Her vital signs indicated septic shock. Lung examination by auscultation revealed holo-crackle and lobar pneumonia in chest radiography, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was suspected. However, sputum and blood cultures revealed Gram-negative coccus identified as K. pneumoniae. Genetic analysis identified the isolated strain as the K2 serotype harboring rmpA, iutA, entB, and mrkD. Therefore, we identified the isolated strain as hypervirulent. The isolate belonged to ST86 as determined by multilocus sequence typing. The case was not complicated by predisposing factors such as diabetes mellitus and malignancy related to HV-KP infection; thus, this CAP-causing HV-KP strain may differ from the typical HV-KP strain that induces liver abscess. A literature review identified only nine cases with CAP due to HV-KP. In all cases, the disease mainly occurred in older males with diabetes mellitus, which makes the present case unusual, and had high rates of septic shock and death. No case, including ours, was complicated by metastatic infection, suggesting that CAP due to HV-KP poses little distant metastasis risk, even in patients with bloodstream infection. In our review, consistent with our case, K2-ST86 was the most common strain of HV-KP in patients with CAP. Therefore, studies are needed to elucidate the clinical and microbiological features of HV-KP CAP, with a focus on the K2-ST86 strain. Physicians should always consider K. pneumoniae in cases of sepsis CAP with lobar pneumonia.","Hirai, Jun; Sakanashi, Daisuke; Kinjo, Takeshi; Haranaga, Shusaku; Fujita, Jiro",Infect Drug Resist,669,5

METHODS: Between pre-pandemic ELSA-Brasil assessments in 2008-2010 (wave-1), 2012-2014 (wave-2), 2016-2018 (wave-3) and three pandemic assessments in 2020 (COVID-19 waves in May-July, July-September, and October-December), rates of common psychiatric symptoms, and depressive, anxiety, and common mental disorders (CMDs) were compared using the Clinical Interview Scheduled-Revised (CIS-R) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Multivariable generalized linear models, adjusted by age, gender, educational level, and ethnicity identified variables associated with an elevated risk for mental disorders. RESULTS: In 2117 participants (mean age 62.3 years, 58.2% females), rates of CMDs and depressive disorders did not significantly change over time, oscillating from 23.5% to 21.1%, and 3.3% to 2.8%, respectively; whereas rate of anxiety disorders significantly decreased (2008-2010: 13.8%; 2016-2018: 9.8%; 2020: 8%). There was a decrease along three wave-COVID assessments for depression [ß = -0.37, 99.5% confidence interval (CI) -0.50 to -0.23], anxiety (ß = -0.37, 99.5% CI -0.48 to -0.26), and stress (ß = -0.48, 99.5% CI -0.64 to -0.33) symptoms (all ps < 0.001).

We investigated the immunological differences between two types of vaccines—spike protein from the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus and inactivated influenza virus vaccine, in combination with a single-stranded RNA adjuvant—administered through various routes (intramuscular, intradermal, and intranasal) to BALB/c mice. Intramuscular immunization with the RNA adjuvant-formulated spike protein elicited the highest humoral immune response, characterized by IgG1 and neutralizing antibody production. Although intranasal immunization did not elicit a humoral response, it showed extensive T-cell activation through large-scale induction of interferon-γ-and interleukin-2-secreting cells, as well as CD4+ T-cell activation in mouse splenocytes. Moreover, only intranasal immunization induced IgA production. When immunized with the inactivated influenza vaccine, administration of the RNA adjuvant via all routes led to protection after viral challenge, regardless of the presence of a vaccine-specific antibody. Therefore, the inoculation route should depend on the type of immune response needed; i.e., the intramuscular route is suitable for eliciting a humoral immune response, whereas the intranasal route is useful for T-cell activation and IgA induction.","Kim, Hye-Jung; Kwak, Hye Won; Kang, Kyung Won; Bang, Yoo-Jin; Lee, Yu-Sun; Park, Hyeong-Jun; Kim, Jae-Yong; Park, Hyo-Jung; Hwang, Kyung-Ah; Lee, Sang-Myeong; Nam, Jae-Hwan",Pharmaceutics,669,22

Methods: Using Baidu Index Platform (http://index.baidu.com) and the website of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention as data resources, we obtained the search volume (SV) of keywords for symptoms associated with COVID-19 from January 1 to February 20 in each year from 2017 to 2020, in Hubei province and other top 10 impacted provinces in China and the epidemic data. Data of 2020 were compared with the previous three years. Data of Hubei province were compared with confirmed cases. The differences and characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlation between the SV of COVID-19 and new confirmed or suspected cases were analyzed and the hysteresis effects were discussed. R3.6.2 software was used to analyze the data. Results: Compared the data from January 1 to February 20, 2020, with the SV for the same period of previous three years, Hubei's SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea and other symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P<0.001). The SV of COVID-19 in Hubei province was significantly correlated with new confirmed or suspected cases (r(confirmed)=0.723, r(suspected)=0.863, all P<0.001). The results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who retrieved relevant symptoms on the internet may begin to see a doctor in 2-3 days later and be diagnosed in 3-4 days later. Conclusions: The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms is higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the SV of diarrhea also increases significantly.

We use a unique panel survey of a representative sample households in Addis Ababa to study both food security and food consumption during the pandemic. In contrast to some other countries in the region, Ethiopia never went into a full lockdown severely restricting movement. Despite subjective income measures suggesting a large proportion of households have been exposed to job loss or reduced incomes, we find that relative to a survey conducted in August and September of 2019, food consumption and household dietary diversity are largely unchanged or slightly increased by August 2020. We find some changes in the composition of food consumption, but they are not related to shocks found in previous phone surveys conducted with the same households. The results therefore suggest the types of subjective questions about income typically being asked in COVID-19 phone surveys may not appropriately reflect the magnitude of such shocks. They also imply, at least indirectly, that in the aggregate food value chains have been resilient to the shock associated with the pandemic.","Hirvonen, Kalle; de Brauw, Alan; Abate, Gashaw T",American journal of agricultural economics,669,29

In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a Twitter-based campaign centered on using the hashtag #DHPSP to promote the visibility of the DHPSP initiative. Thus, tweets containing #DHPSP were monitored for five weeks for the period 20.10.2020-24.11.2020 and were analyzed with Symplur Signals (social media analytics tool). In the study period, a total of 11,005 tweets containing #DHPSP were posted by 3,020 Twitter users, generating 151,984,378 impressions. Analysis of the healthcare stakeholder-identity of the Twitter users who used #DHPSP revealed that the most of participating user accounts belonged to individuals or doctors, with the top three user locations being the United States (501 users), the United Kingdom (155 users), and India (121 users). Analysis of co-occurring hashtags and the full text of the posted tweets further revealed that the major themes of attention in the #DHPSP Twitter-community were related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), medicine and health, digital health technologies, and science communication in general. Overall, these results indicate that the #DHPSP initiative achieved high visibility and engaged a large body of Twitter users interested in the DHPSP focus area. Moreover, the conducted campaign resulted in an increase of DHPSP member enrollments and website visitors, and new scientific collaborations were formed. Thus, Twitter campaigns centered on a dedicated hashtag prove to be a highly efficient tool for visibility-promotion, which could be successfully utilized by healthcare-related open innovation platforms or initiatives.","Kletecka-Pulker, Maria Mondal Himel Wang Dongdong Gonzalo Parra R.; Yusif Maigoro, Abdulkadir Lee Soojin Garg Tushar Mulholland Eoghan J.; Prasad Devkota, Hari Konwar Bikramjit Patnaik Sourav S.; Lordan, Ronan Nawaz Faisal A.; Tsagkaris, Christos Rayan Rehab A.; Maria Louka, Anna De Ronita Badhe Pravin Schaden Eva Willschke Harald Maleczek Mathias Kumar Boyina Hemanth Khalid Garba M.; Sahab Uddin, Md Sanusi Khan Johra Odimegwu Joy I.; Wai Kan Yeung, Andy Akram Faizan Siva Sai Chandragiri Bucher Sherri Kumar Paswan Shravan Singla Rajeev K.; Shen, Bairong Di Lonardo Sara Tosevska Anela Simal-Gandara Jesus Zec Manja González-Burgos Elena Habijan Marija Battino Maurizio Giampieri Francesca Tikhonov Aleksei Cianciosi Danila Forbes-Hernandez Tamara Y.; Quiles, José L.; Mezzetti, Bruno Babiaka Smith B.; E.

Cell stress is an established mechanism known to be associated with infection and cancer. Different proteins crucial for cellular response to stress are reported to be a possible target to stop the infection and to reduce the chemo-resistance in cancer. Heat shock protein (HSP) families of chaperones play an essential role in cells both in normal state and under stress. The upregulation of HSP5A, also termed GRP78 or Bip, is reported in different viral infections.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) to prevent circuit clotting is mandatory but monitoring is complicated by (pseudo)-heparin resistance. In this observational study, we compared two different activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assays and a chromogenic anti-Xa assay in COVID-19 patients on CRRT or ECMO in relation to their UFH dosages and acute phase reactants. Materials and Methods The aPTT (optical [aPTT-CS] and/or mechanical [aPTT-STA] clot detection methods were used), anti-Xa, factor VIII (FVIII), antithrombin III (ATIII), and fibrinogen were measured in 342 samples from 7 COVID-19 patients on CRRT or ECMO during their UFH treatment. Dosage of UFH was primarily based on the aPTT-CS with a heparin therapeutic range (HTR) of 50-80s. Associations between different variables were made using linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Results Dosage of UFH was above 35,000IU/24 hours in all patients. aPTT-CS and aPTT-STA were predominantly within the HTR. Anti-Xa was predominantly above the HTR (0.3-0.7 IU/mL) and ATIII concentration was >70% for all patients; mean FVIII and fibrinogen were 606% and 7.5 g/L, respectively. aPTT-CS correlated with aPTT-STA ( r 2 = 0.68) with a bias of 39.3%. Correlation between aPTT and anti-Xa was better for aPTT-CS (0.78 &#8804; r 2 &#8804; 0.94) than for aPTT-STA (0.34 &#8804; r 2 &#8804; 0.81). There was no general correlation between the aPTT-CS and ATIII, FVIII, fibrinogen, thrombocytes, C-reactive protein, or ferritin. Conclusion All included COVID-19 patients on CRRT or ECMO conformed to the definition of heparin resistance. A patient-specific association was found between aPTT and anti-Xa. This association could not be explained by FVIII or fibrinogen.","Streng, Alexander S; Delnoij, Thijs S R; Mulder, Mark M G; Sels, Jan Willem E M; Wetzels, Rick J H; Verhezen, Paul W M; Olie, Renske H; Kooman, Jeroen P; van Kuijk, Sander M J; Brandts, Lloyd; Ten Cate, Hugo; Lorusso, Roberto; van der Horst, Iwan C C; van Bussel, Bas C T; Henskens, Yvonne M C",TH Open,669,24

In this report, we focus our attention on the Veneto Region, in the North-East of Italy, which is one of the areas that were first affected by the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. We aim to evaluate the trend of all-cause mortality and to give a description of the characteristics of the studied population. METHODS: Data used in the analyses were released by the majority of municipalities and cover the 93% of the total population living in the Veneto Region. We evaluated the trend of overall mortality from Jan.01 to Jun.30. 2020. Moreover we compared the COVID-19-related deaths to the overall deaths. RESULTS: From March 2020, the overall mortality rate increased exponentially, affecting males and people aged > 76 the most. The confirmed COVID-19-related death rate in the Veneto region between Mar.01 and Apr.302020 is 30 per 100,000 inhabitants. In contrast, the all-cause mortality increase registered in the same months in the municipalities included in the study is 219 per 100,000 inhabitants. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has a primary role in the increase in mortality but does not entirely explain such a high number of deaths. Strategies need to be developed to reduce this gap in case of future waves of the pandemic.","Gallo, Elisa; Prosepe, Ilaria; Lorenzoni, Giulia; Acar, Aslihan Sentürk; Lanera, Corrado; Berchialla, Paola; Azzolina, Danila; Gregori, Dario",BMC Public Health,669,16

IA-CEPA, which takes effect from 5 July 2020, is a comprehensive partnership between Indonesia - Australia in the fields of trade in goods, investment, services, and also economic cooperation. This research is qualitative in nature by collecting data through literature study. The analysis knife in this research is international cooperation and bilateral relations. Apart from discussing trade in goods, the IA-CEPA agreement also encourages strategic partnerships in the fields of investment, economy, health, increasing labor capacity, trade in services, transportation, tourism and so on. The results of this study conclude that the IA-CEPA made a real contribution to economic recovery during the Covid-19 period. In the investment and trade sector, Australia provides loans to Indonesia to help the business world. In the health sector, cooperation is focused on the production of masks, medical devices and medical personnel. Meanwhile, in the field of tourism, the two countries are trying to increase the return of tourist visits by still paying attention to health, safety and tourism needs. Thus, the signing of the IA-CEPA illustrates the realization of good bilateral relations in which the two countries contribute to economic recovery during the Covid-19 period. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected by means of an online survey among people working in organizations with a minimum of 10 employees (N = 1,033) and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings Results show that informational and relational communication as organizational resources have a significant but distinct influence on how employees support their employer during the crisis. While informational communication influences employees' acceptance of managerial decisions, relational communication exerts most influence on affective commitment, which is the strongest driver of job engagement. Research limitations/implications The cross-sectional design, specific crisis situation and geographic location are limitations of the study. Practical implications Delivering relevant information to employees quickly and reliably is important. Yet, relationship-oriented communication that demonstrates appreciation and allows for participation has even stronger effects on job engagement, which is essential to mastering challenges arising from a crisis. Social implications During the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations demanded much from their employees.

There is an urgent need for specific treatments. One potential treatment is chloroquine and its derivatives, including hydroxychloroquine, which have both antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. These compounds are effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, but in vivo data are lacking. Although some encouraging outcomes have been reported, and these results have been received enthusiastically, we recommend careful and critical evaluation of current evidence only when all methods and data are available for peer review. Chloroquine is safe and cheap. However, further evidence from coordinated multicentre trials is required before it can be confidently said whether it is effective against the current pandemic.","Sturrock, Beattie Rh; Chevassut, Timothy Jt",,669,10

METHODS: The clinical manifestations, laboratory parameters, and CT imaging findings were analyzed in 34 COVID-19 patients, confirmed by RT-PCR from January 20 to February 4 in Hainan Province. CT scores were compared between the discharged patients and the ICU patients. RESULTS: Fever (85%) and cough (79%) were most commonly seen. Ten (29%) patients demonstrated negative results on their first RT-PCR. Of the 34 (65%) patients, 22 showed pure ground-glass opacity. Of the 34 (50%) patients, 17 had five lobes of lung involvement, while the 23 (68%) patients had lower lobe involvement. The lesions of 24 (71%) patients were distributed mainly in the subpleural area. The initial CT lesions of ICU patients were distributed in both the subpleural area and centro-parenchyma (80%), and the lesions were scattered. Sixty percent of ICU patients had five lobes involved, while this was seen in only 25% of the discharged patients. The lesions of discharged patients were mainly in the subpleural area (75%). Of the discharged patients, 62.5% showed pure ground-glass opacities; 80% of the ICU patients were in the progressive stage, and 75% of the discharged patients were at an early stage. CT scores of the ICU patients were significantly higher than those of the discharged patients. CONCLUSION: Chest CT plays a crucial role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly for those patients with a negative RT-PCR. The initial features in CT may be associated with prognosis. KEY POINTS: â¢ Chest CT is valuable for the early diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly for those patients with a negative RT-PCR. â¢ The early CT findings of COVID-19 in ICU patients differed from those of discharged patients.","Chen, Hui Juan; Qiu, Jie; Wu, Biao; Huang, Tao; Gao, Yunsuo; Wang, Zhen Ping; Chen, Yang; Chen, Feng",Eur Radiol,669,22

This study aimed to explore the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in non-COVID-19 patients with ESRD undergoing in-center hemodialysis (HD). A mixed-methods study was conducted with a purposive sample recruited from one dialysis unit in Portugal. Quantitative data were collected retrospectively from patients' medical records from February 2020 (T1-before the outbreak) and from April 2020 (T2-during lockdown). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 patients (66.9 ± 11.9 years old) undergoing HD for an average of 46.1 months (±39.5) in April 2020. Overall results suggested that dialysis adequacy and serum albumin levels decreased significantly at T2, while phosphorus levels increased. The findings from thematic analysis suggested several psychosocial negative impacts and impacts on disease and treatment-related health behaviors (eg, difficulties managing dietary restrictions during the lockdown and diminished physical activity), which can partially explain these quantitative results. However, some patients were also able to find positive impacts in this experience and problem-focused and emotional strategies were identified to cope with the demands of COVID-19. Several recommendations have been made to mitigate patients' emotional, relational, and educational unmet needs during the current pandemic and in the event of new outbreaks.","Sousa, Helena; Ribeiro, Oscar; Costa, Elísio; Frontini, Roberta; Paúl, Constança; Amado, Leonilde; Miranda, Vasco; Ribeiro, Fernando; Figueiredo, Daniela",Sem. dial,669,5

We reported on the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children cases to help health workers better understand and provide timely diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Retrospectively, two research centers' case series of 67 consecutive hospitalized cases including 53 adult and 14 children cases with COVID-19 between 23 Jan 2020 and 15 Feb 2020 from Jinan and Rizhao were enrolled in this study. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children and adults were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Most cases in children were mild (21.4%) and conventional cases (78.6%), with mild clinical signs and symptoms, and all cases were of family clusters. Fever (35.7%) and dry cough (21.4%) were described as clinical manifestations in children cases. Dry cough and phlegm were not the most common symptoms in children compared with adults (p = 0.03). In the early stages of the disease, lymphocyte counts did not significantly decline but neutrophils count did in children compared with adults (p = 0.02). There was a lower level of CRP (p = 0.00) in children compared with adults. There were 8 (57.1%) asymptomatic cases and 6 (42.9%) symptomatic cases among the 14 children cases. The age of asymptomatic patients was younger than that of symptomatic patients (p = 0.03). Even among asymptomatic patients, 5 (62.5%) cases had lung injuries including 3 (60%) cases with bilateral involvement, which was not different compared with that of symptomatic cases (p = 0.58, p = 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of children are mild, there is substantial lung injury even among children, but that there is less clinical disease, perhaps because of a less pronounced inflammatory response, and that the occurrence of this pattern appears to inversely correlate with age.","Du, Wenjun; Yu, Jinhong; Wang, Hui; Zhang, Xiaoguo; Zhang, Shouwei; Li, Qiang; Zhang, Zhongfa",Infection,669,19

Yet we are unaware of resources that provide country-specific Covid-19 incidence data. Methods: We undertook a descriptive analysis of the global impact of Covid-19 using data reported on March 17, 2020. The prevalence of Covid-19 cases, fatalities attributed to Covid-19, and the case fatality rate for each of the 238 countries were accessed from the World Health Organization global Covid-19 tracking site, and we additionally calculated Covid-19 incidence based on country-specific population data. We determined the country-specific point prevalence and incidence of Covid-19 and associated deaths while using geocoded data to display their spatial distribution with geographic heat maps. Results: The analysis included 193,197 Covid-19 cases and 7859 associated deaths. The point prevalence was highest in China (80,881), Italy (31,506), Iran (16,169), and Spain (11,312); no other country reported more than 10,000 cases. The incidence (per million population) was highest in San Marino (3389) followed by Iceland (645) and Italy (521); no other country had an incidence above 400 per million population. Conclusion: Countries with a high Covid-19 prevalence may not have a high incidence, and vice versa.

Almost all known approaches to vaccine design were applied for this purpose, including inactivated viruses, mRNA and DNA-vaccines, vaccines based on various viral vectors, synthetically generated peptides and recombinant proteins produced in cells of insects and mammals. This review considers one of the promising vaccine platforms based on messenger RNA. Until recent years, mRNA-vaccination was out of practical implementation due to high sensitivity to nuclease degradation and consequent instability of drugs based on mRNA. Latest technological advances significantly mitigated the problems of low immunogenicity, instability, and difficulties in RNA-vaccine delivery. It is worth noting that mRNA-vaccines can efficiently activate both components of the immune system, i. e. T-cell and humoral responses. The essential advantage of mRNAvaccines includes fast, inexpensive, scalable and uniform production providing a large output of desirable products in vitro. Synthesis and purification processes significantly simplify the process technology of mRNA drugs with injectable purity. Thus, mRNA production via in vitro transcription is more advantageous as compared with DNA-vaccines since it is a chemical process without the use of cells. mRNA techniques make it possible to pass all the phases of vaccine development much faster in comparison with the production of vaccines based on inactivated viruses or recombinant proteins. This property is critically important when designing vaccines against viral pathogens as the main problem of disease control includes a time gap between an epidemic and vaccine development. This paper discusses studies on the development of vaccines against coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 with special attention to the mRNA technique.","Ilyichev, A. A.; Orlova, L. A.; Sharabrin, S.

Background: The COVID-19-pandemic is an unprecedented, exceptional situation and necessitates numerous adaptations of structures and processes in the acute inpatient setting. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore how acute inpatient care was influenced by the pandemic and which implications may result for the future from nursing managers' and hygiene specialists' point of view. METHODS: Qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with five nursing managers and three hygiene specialists in four German acute care hospitals. Interviews were interpreted by using content analysis. RESULTS: Interviewees described how everyday routines in their hospitals were adapted to the prioritized care for COVID-19 patients. Main challenges were uncertainty and anxiety among staff, relative scarcity of equipment and workforce resources and rapid implementation of new requirements for treatment capacities. This was addressed by targeted communication and information, large efforts to ensure resources and coordinated control of all processes by cross-department, interprofessional task forces. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptations made to the structures and procedures of care delivery during the pandemic hold potential for future improvements of routine care, e. g. new workplace and skill mix models. To identify detailed practical implications, a renewed and deepened data analysis is needed at a later point of time, with a larger distance to the period of the pandemic.","Silies, Katharina; Schley, Angelika; Sill, Janna; Fleischer, Steffen; Müller, Martin; Balzer, Katrin",Pflege,669,6

A patient requiring multiorgan support is at a higher risk for pressure injuries related to immobility, sedation, vasopressors, and hypoxia. To mitigate pressure injuries, our hospital utilizes a bundle approach to prevent skin injury. However, despite efforts to prevent pressure injuries, we found our patients in the ICU with the diagnosis of COVID-19 went on to develop significant pressure and mucosal injuries. This is a case report of 4 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who developed significant skin and mucosal injuries during their ICU admissions in the month of March 2020. We found that patients developed skin conditions that were initially thought to be deep-tissue injuries (DTIs) early in the admission. The DTIs progressed over the course of the admission in the ICU and evolved to thick adherent eschar that appeared to be unstageable pressure injuries, which extended beyond the soft tissue directly over the bony prominence. We also found that skin damage to the mucosa of the nares, tongue, lips, and urethra presented first as inflammation and then progressed to thick eschar. Despite maximum pressure relief with the use of a pressure-relieving turn and position system, bordered foam dressings, fluidized positioners, specialty beds, and leadership support for twice-a-week skin checks, our patients diagnosed with COVID-19 developed extensive skin damage across the fleshy portion of the buttocks and on the mucosa of the nares, tongue, lips, and urethra during minimal exposure to pressure. Although the initial presentation of the skin damage appeared to be related to pressure, the extent of the skin damage suggests a vascular inflammatory process beyond skin damage related to pressure.","Singh, Charleen; Tay, Jafar; Shoqirat, Noordeen",J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,669,5

The existing therapies are limited in dealing with SARS-CoV-2 due to the sudden appearance of the virus. Therefore, vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need. We took immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S), membrane glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. Allergenicity, toxicity, physiochemical properties analysis and stability were examined to confirm the specificity and selectivity of the epitope candidates. We identified a total of five B cell epitopes in RBD of S protein, seven MHC class-I, and 18 MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes from S, M and N protein which showed non-allergenic, non-toxic and highly antigenic features and non-mutated in 55,179 SARS-CoV-2 virus strains until June 25, 2020.

We present an analysis using a spherical harmonic model to determine the level of anisotropy in the first LIGO/Virgo transient catalog. We find that the ten binary black hole mergers within the first transient catalog are consistent with an isotropic distribution. We carry out a study of simulated events to assess the prospects for future probes of anisotropy.

Due to the limited effectiveness of current therapies, new treatment strategies are needed. Our aim was to examine the effect of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) on obesity and its associated diseases in a diet-induced obese (DIO) animal model. C57BL6 mice were fed with either high fat diet (HFD) or CHOW diet for 15 weeks. Obese and lean mice were then subjected to two doses of AD-MSCs intraperitoneally. Mice body weight and composition; food intake; blood glucose levels; glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) were measured. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-&#945; and interleukin-6, were also determined. AD-MSCs treatment reduced blood glucose levels, HbA1c and AIP as well as improved glucose tolerance in DIO mice. In addition, MSCs caused significant attenuation in the levels of inflammatory mediators in HFD-fed mice. Taken together, AD-MSCs were effective in treating obesity-associated diabetes in an animal model as well as protective against cardiovascular diseases as shown by AIP, which might be partly due to the attenuation of inflammatory mediators. Thus, AD-MSCs may offer a promising therapeutic potential in counteracting obesity-related diseases in patients.","Jaber, Hala; Issa, Khodr; Eid, Ali; Saleh, Fatima A",Sci Rep,669,26

Functional relevance of genetic variations in Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), two crucial host factors for viral entry, might explain some of this variation. Methods: In this comparative study in Indian subjects, we recruited 510 COVID-19 patients and retrieved DNA from 520 controls from a repository. Associations between variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with disease severity were identified by whole exome sequencing (WES, nâ¯=â¯20) and targeted genotyping (nâ¯=â¯1010). Molecular dynamic simulations (MDS) were performed to explore functional relevance of the variants. Cleavage of spike glycoprotein by wild and variant TMPRSS2 was determined in HEK293T cells. Potential effects of confounders on the association between genotype and disease severity were tested (Mantel-Haenszel test). Results: WES identified deleterious variant in TMPRSS2 (rs12329760, Gâ¯>â¯A, p. V160M). The minor allele frequency (MAF) was 0·27 in controls, 0·31 in asymptomatic, 0·21 in mild-to-moderately affected and 0·19 in severely affected COVID-19 patients. Risk of severity increased with decreasing MAF: Asymptomatic: Odds ratio-0·69 (95% CI-0·52-0·93; pâ¯=â¯0·01); mild-to-moderate: Odds ratio-1·89 (95% CI-1·22-2.92;pâ¯=â¯0·004) and severe: Odds ratio-1·79 (95% CI-1·11-2.88;pâ¯=â¯0·01). No confounding effect of diabetes and hypertension were observed on the risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease with respect to genotype. MDS revealed decreased stability of TMPRSS2 with 160â¯M variant. Spike glycoprotein cleavage by TMPRSS2 reduced ~2·4-fold in cells expressing 160â¯M variant. Conclusion: We demonstrate association of TMPRSS2 variant rs12329760 with decreased disease severity in COVID-19 patients from India.","Ravikanth, Vishnubhotla; Sasikala, Mitnala; Naveen, Vankadari; Latha, Sabbu Sai; Parsa, Kishore Venkata Laxmi; Vijayasarathy, Ketavarapu; Amanchy, Ramars; Avanthi, Steffie; Govardhan, Bale; Rakesh, Kalapala; Kumari, Daram Sarala; Srikaran, Bojja; Rao, Guduru Venkat; Reddy, D Nageshwar",Meta Gene,669,1

STUDY DESIGN: Children with MIS-C admitted to pediatric intensive care units in New York City between April 23 and May 23, 2020, were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. RESULTS: Of 33 children with MIS-C, the median age was 10 years; 61% were male; 45% were Hispanic/Latino; and 39% were black. Comorbidities were present in 45%. Fever (93%) and vomiting (69%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 63% of patients with median ejection fraction of 46.6% (IQR, 39.5-52.8). C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, d-dimer, and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in all patients. For treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 18 (54%), corticosteroids in 17 (51%), tocilizumab in 12 (36%), remdesivir in 7 (21%), vasopressors in 17 (51%), mechanical ventilation in 5 (15%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 1 (3%), and intra-aortic balloon pump in 1 (3%).

Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) may provide time efficient means of rapid multiparametric quantitative MRI. The accuracy of MRF, however, relies on adequate control over system imperfections, such as eddy currents and $B_1^+$, which are different and not as well established on MRL systems compared to diagnostic systems. In this study we investigate the technical feasibility of gradient spoiled 2D MRF on a 1.5T MRL. We show with phantom experiments that the MRL generates reliable MRF signals that are temporally stable during the day and have good agreement with spin-echo reference measurements. Subsequent in-vivo MRF scans in healthy volunteers and a patient with a colorectal liver metastasis showed good image quality, where the quantitative values of selected organs corresponded with the values reported in literature. Therefore we conclude that gradient spoiled 2D MRF is feasible on a 1.5T MRL with similar performance as on a diagnostic system. The precision and accuracy of the parametric maps are sufficient for further investigation of the clinical utility of MRF for online quantitatively MRI-guided radiotherapy.","Bruijnen, Tom; van der Heide, Oscar; Intven, Martijn P W; Mook, Stella; Lagendijk, Jan J W; Van den Berg, Cornelis A T; Tijssen, Rob H N",Phys. med. biol,669,1

Understanding ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 by ophthalmologists and others may facilitate the diagnosis and prevention of transmission of the disease. Objective: To investigate ocular manifestations and viral prevalence in the conjunctiva of patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case series, patients with COVID-19 treated from February 9 to 15, 2020, at a hospital center in Hubei province, China, were retrospectively reviewed for ocular manifestations. During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Of the 38 included patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, 25 (65.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 65.8 (16.6) years. Among them, 28 patients (73.7%) had positive findings for COVID-19 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and of these, 2 patients (5.2%) yielded positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in their conjunctival as well as nasopharyngeal specimens. A total of 12 of 38 patients (31.6%; 95% CI, 17.5-48.7) had ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms. In addition, 11 of 12 patients with ocular abnormalities (91.7%; 95% CI, 61.5-99.8) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Of these, 2 (16.7%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from both conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, one-third of patients with COVID-19 had ocular abnormalities, which frequently occurred in patients with more severe COVID-19. Although there is a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in tears, it is possible to transmit via the eyes.","Wu, Ping; Duan, Fang; Luo, Chunhua; Liu, Qiang; Qu, Xingguang; Liang, Liang; Wu, Kaili",JAMA Ophthalmol,669,16

Considerable efforts are also directed at detecting and preventing different modes of community transmission. Among them is the rapid detection of virus presence on different surfaces with which people may come in contact. Detection based on non-contact optical techniques is very helpful in managing the spread of the virus, and to aid in the disinfection of surfaces. Nanomaterial-based methods are proven suitable for rapid detection. Given the immense need for science led innovative solutions, this manuscript critically reviews recent literature to specifically illustrate nano-engineered effective and rapid solutions. In addition, all the different techniques are critically analyzed, compared, and contrasted to identify the most promising methods. Moreover, promising research ideas for high accuracy of detection in trace concentrations, via color change and light-sensitive nanostructures, to assist fingerprint techniques (to identify the virus at the contact surface of the gas and solid phase) are also presented.","Rabiee, Navid; Bagherzadeh, Mojtaba; Ghasemi, Amir; Zare, Hossein; Ahmadi, Sepideh; Fatahi, Yousef; Dinarvand, Rassoul; Rabiee, Mohammad; Ramakrishna, Seeram; Shokouhimehr, Mohammadreza; Varma, Rajender S",Int. j. mol. sci.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a follow-up survey to assess changes in PPE-preparedness across six Asia-Pacific countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A prospective follow-up cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted between 10/08/2020 to 01/09/ 2020, five months after the initial Phase 1 survey. The survey was sent to the same 231 intensivists across the six Asia-Pacific countries (Australia, Hong Kong, India, New Zealand, Philippines, and Singapore) that participated in Phase 1. The main outcome measure was to identify any changes in PPE-preparedness between Phases 1 and 2. FINDINGS: Phase 2 had responses from 132 ICUs (57%). Compared to Phase 1 respondents reported increased use of PPE-based practices such as powered air-purifying respirator (40.2% vs. 6.1%), N95-masks at all times (86.4% vs. 53.7%) and double-gloving (87.9% vs. 42.9%). The reported awareness of PPE stocks (85.6% vs. 51.9%), mandatory showering policies following PPE-breach (31.1% vs. 6.9%) and safety perception amongst HCWs (60.6% vs. 28.4%) improved significantly during Phase 2. Despite reported statistically similar adoption rate of the buddy system in both phases (42.4% vs. 37.2%), there was a reported reduction in donning/doffing training in Phase 2 (44.3% vs. 60.2%). There were no reported differences HCW training in other areas, such as tracheal intubation, intra-hospital transport and safe waste disposal, between the 2 phases. CONCLUSIONS: Overall reported PPE-preparedness improved between the two survey periods, particularly in PPE use, PPE inventory and HCW perceptions of safety. However, the uptake of HCW training and implementation of low-cost safety measures continued to be low and the awareness of PPE breach management policies were suboptimal. Therefore, the key areas for improvement should focus on regular HCW training, implementing low-cost buddy-system and increasing awareness of PPE-breach management protocols.","Gullapalli, Navya; Lim, Zheng Jie; Ramanathan, Kollengode; Bihari, Shailesh; Haji, Jumana; Shekar, Kiran; Wong, Wai Tat; Rajamani, Arvind; Subramaniam, Ashwin",Aust. crit. care,669,16

This was a prospective observational study of SARS-CoV2 positive critically ill patients treated in a multidisciplinary ICU. Thirty (30) Greek patients were included, in whom 25(OH)D was measured on ICU admission. Eighty (80%) percent of patients had vitamin D deficiency, and the remaining insufficiency. Based on 25(OH)D levels, patients were stratified in two groups: higher and lower than the median value of the cohort (15.2 ng/mL). The two groups did not differ in their demographic or clinical characteristics. All patients who died within 28 days belonged to the low vitamin D group. Survival analysis showed that the low vitamin D group had a higher 28-day survival absence probability (log-rank test, p = 0.01). Critically ill COVID-19 patients who died in the ICU within 28 days appeared to have lower ICU admission 25(OH)D levels compared to survivors. When the cohort was divided at the median 25(OH)D value, the low vitamin D group had an increased risk of 28-day mortality. It seems plausible, therefore, that low 25(OH)D levels may predispose COVID-19 patients to an increased 28-day mortality risk.","Vassiliou, Alice G; Jahaj, Edison; Pratikaki, Maria; Orfanos, Stylianos E; Dimopoulou, Ioanna; Kotanidou, Anastasia",Nutrients,669,30

Multidisciplinary strategies across socio-economic and psychological levels may be needed to mitigate the mental health burden of COVID-19. Preliminary evidence from the rapidly progressing field of psychedelic science shows that psilocybin therapy offers a promising transdiagnostic treatment strategy for a range of disorders with restricted and maladaptive habitual patterns of cognition and behaviour, notably depression, addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder. The COMPASS Pathways (COMPASS) phase 2b double-blind trial of psilocybin therapy in antidepressant-free, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is underway to determine the safety, efficacy and optimal dose of psilocybin. Results from the Imperial College London Psilodep-RCT comparing the efficacy and mechanisms of action of psilocybin therapy to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram will soon be published. However, the efficacy and safety of psilocybin therapy in conjunction with SSRIs in TRD is not yet known. An additional COMPASS study, with a centre in Dublin, will begin to address this question, with potential implications for the future delivery of psilocybin therapy. While at a relatively early stage of clinical development, and notwithstanding the immense challenges of COVID-19, psilocybin therapy has the potential to play an important therapeutic role for various psychiatric disorders in post-COVID-19 clinical psychiatry.","Kelly, J R; Crockett, M T; Alexander, L; Haran, M; Baker, A; Burke, L; Brennan, C; O039,; Keane, V",Ir J Psychol Med,669,1

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess two decades of research on the efficacy of MBIs in reducing binge eating severity. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library for trials assessing the use of MBIs to treat binge eating severity in both clinical and non-clinical samples. The systematic review and meta-analysis was pre-registered at PROSPERO (CRD42020182395). RESULTS: Twenty studies involving 21 samples (11 RCT and 10 uncontrolled samples) met inclusion criteria. Random effects meta-analyses on the 11 RCT samples (nâ¯=â¯618: MBIs nâ¯=â¯335, controls nâ¯=â¯283) showed that MBIs significantly reduced binge eating severity (gâ¯=â¯-0.39, 95% CI -0.68, -0.11) at end of trial, but was not maintained at follow-up (gâ¯=â¯-0.06, 95% CI, -0.31, 0.20, kâ¯=â¯5). No evidence of publication bias was detected. On the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2, trials were rarely rated at high risk of bias and drop-out rates did not differ between MBIs and control groups. MBIs also significantly reduced depression, and improved both emotion regulation and mindfulness ability. CONCLUSION: MBIs reduce binge eating severity at the end of trials. Benefits were not maintained at follow-up; however, only five studies were assessed. Future well-powered trials should focus on assessing diversity better, including more men and people from ethnic minority backgrounds.","Grohmann, Dominique; Laws, Keith R",J Psychosom Res,669,1

Endothelial cells participate in the formation of blood vessels and play an important role in the whole process of wound healing. Recent studies suggested that exosomes contribute to the intercellular communication through paracrine pathways, and sustained release of exosomes from hydrogel-based materials provide a promising strategy for curing wound defects. In this study, we isolated exosomes derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and found that HUVECs derived exosomes (HUVECs-Exos) could promote the proliferation and migration activities of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which are two important effector cells for skin regeneration. Then we developed gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel as the wound dressing to incorporate HUVECs-Exos and applied it to the full-thickness cutaneous wounds. It demonstrated that GelMA scaffold could not only repair the wound defect, but also achieve sustained release of exosomes. The in vivo results showed accelerated re-epithelialization, promotion of collagen maturity and improvement of angiogenesis. Collectively, our findings suggested that HUVECs-Exos could accelerate wound healing and GelMA mediated controlled release of HUVECs-Exos might offer a new method for repairing cutaneous wound defects.","Zhao, Danyang; Yu, Zhencheng; Li, Yun; Wang, Yu; Li, Qingfeng; Han, Dong",J. mol. histol,669,16

We assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurotrauma presentations in the first 3 months after shutdown throughout Pennsylvania. METHODS: The Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation was queried for registry data from the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcomes Study between March 12 and June 5 in each year from 2017 to 2020. RESULTS: After the COVID-19 shutdown, there was a 27% reduction in neurotrauma volume, from 2680 cases in 2017 to 2018 cases in 2020, and a 28.8% reduction in traumatic brain injury volume. There was no significant difference in neurotrauma phenotype incurred relative to total cases. Injury mechanism was less likely to be motor vehicle collision and more likely caused by falls, gunshot wound, and recreational vehicle accidents (P < 0.05). Location of injury was less likely on roads and public locations and more likely at indoor private locations (P < 0.05). The proportion of patients with neurotrauma with blood alcohol concentration >0.08 g/dL was reduced in 2020 (11.4% vs. 9.0%; P < 0.05). Mortality was higher during 2020 compared with pre-COVID years (7.7% vs. 6.4%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During statewide shutdown, neurotrauma volume and alcohol-related trauma decreased and low-impact traumas and gunshot wounds increased, with a shift toward injuries occurring in private, indoor locations. These changes increased mortality. However, there was not a change in the types of injuries sustained.","Algattas, Hanna N; McCarthy, David; Kujawski, Brandon; Agarwal, Nitin; Brown, Joshua; Forsythe, Raquel M; Leonardo, Jody; Walsh, Kevin; Gross, Bradley A; Friedlander, Robert M; Okonkwo, David O; Whiting, Donald; Miele, Vincent J",World neurosurgery (Online),669,12

These symptoms have mainly been assessed in single-task setting, which might not represent activities of daily living accurately. Therefore, a dual-task protocol, consisting of the simultaneous performance of cognitive and motor tasks, was developed. This protocol assesses cognitive and motor performance in general, as well as cognitive-motor interference in specific. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The motor component of the 2BALANCE protocol consists of a static and dynamic postural task. These motor tasks are combined with different cognitive tasks assessing visuospatial cognition, processing speed, working memory and response inhibition. First, test-retest reliability will be assessed with an interval of 2 weeks in a group of young adults. Second, the 2BALANCE protocol will be validated in persons with bilateral vestibulopathy. Finally, the protocol will be implemented in persons with unilateral vestibular loss. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The 2BALANCE project aims to elucidate the impact of vestibular dysfunction on cognitive and motor performance in dual-task setting. This protocol represents everyday situations better than single-task protocols, as dual-tasks such as reading street signs while walking are often encountered during daily activities. Ultimately, this project could enable individualised and holistic clinical care in these patients, taking into account single as well as dual-task performance. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The current study was approved by the ethics committee of Ghent University Hospital on 5 July 2019 with registration number B670201940465. All research findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at vestibular as well as multidisciplinary international conferences and meetings.

India started the lockdown on 24 March 2020. We analyzed the air quality of three megacities of India, namely Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, during the lockdown phase and compared it with the pre-lockdown and post-lockdown scenarios. We considered seven major air pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, NH3, SO2, CO, and O3. We analyzed the data acquired from 56 automatic air-monitoring stations (AAMS) under the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) spread across the megacities. The air pollution level in the eastern part of Mumbai and the western part of Delhi and Kolkata usually remains high. Delhi was the worst polluted megacity, followed by Kolkata and Mumbai. The stop of vehicular movements and industrial lockdown across the nation has substantial effects on the environment, especially in the atmosphere near the Earth's surface. Our analysis showed significant improvements in air quality during the period of lockdown (25 March to 14 April 2020) compared to the pre-lockdown phase (3 March to 23 March 2020) and the same time window of the previous year (25 March to 14 April 2019). The post-lockdown (15 April to 5 May) phase exhibited mixed results. We mapped the spatial pattern of these pollutants and the air quality index (AQI). According to CPCB, PM2.5, PM10, and CO are the major air pollutants in India that reduced by 47%, 41%, and 27% in Mumbai;52%, 39%, and 13% in Delhi;and 49%, 37%, and 21% in Kolkata, respectively, in the lockdown phase. PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 exhibited significant correlations across the three megacities. This study shows that occasional short-term lockdowns can effectively refresh the air in these megacities.","Mandal, Jayatra Samanta Sourav Chanda Abhra Halder Sandip",Atmospheric Research,669,16

IoT is increasingly being implemented in distributed settings, making footprints in almost every sector of our life. Unfortunately, for healthcare systems, the entities connected to the IoT networks are exposed to an unprecedented level of security threats. Relying on a huge volume of sensitive and personal data, IoT healthcare systems are facing unique challenges in protecting data security and privacy. Although blockchain has posed to be the solution in this scenario thanks to its inherent distributed ledger technology (DLT), it suffers from major setbacks of increasing storage and computation requirements with the network size. This paper proposes a holochain-based security and privacy-preserving framework for IoT healthcare systems that overcomes these challenges and is particularly suited for resource constrained IoT scenarios. The performance and thorough security analyses demonstrate that a holochain-based IoT healthcare system is significantly better compared to blockchain and other existing systems.","Zaman, Shakila; Khandaker, Muhammad R.

To understand AD, there have been many trials establishing AD animal models. Although various trials to establish AD animal models have been existed, even the mechanisms of AD in animal models are not enough clarified. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed AD characteristics induced in Nishiki-nezumi Cinnamon/Nagoya (Nc/Nga) mice following trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB) treatment for different periods and house dust mite (HDM) treatment to compare each model's immunological patterns, especially with cytokine antibody array tool. METHODS: In this study, we exposed Nc/Nga mice to TNCB or HDM extract to induce AD. Nc/Nga mice were divided into 4 groups: control, TNCB 2 weeks-treated, TNCB 8 weeks-treated, and HDM-treated groups. After AD induction, all mice were evaluated by serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentration and serum cytokine antibody assays, scoring of skin lesions, scoring of scratching frequency, and histological analysis. RESULTS: The results showed significant differences between groups in serum IgE concentration, skin lesion scores, and scratching frequency. The analysis results for serum cytokine antibody arrays showed that in the TNCB 8 weeks- and HDM-treated groups, but not in the TNCB 2 weeks-treated group, expressions of genes related to the immune response were enriched. Among the histological results, the skin lesions in the HDM-treated group were most similar to those of AD. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that immunological pattern of AD mice was markedly different between HDM and TNCB treated groups. In addition, the immunological pattern was quietly different dependent on TNCB treated duration.","Kim, Yoon Hwan; Kim, Tae Hyeong; Kang, Min Soo; Ahn, Jin Ok; Choi, Jung Hoon; Chung, Jin Young",J Vet Sci,669,20

It is important to understand youth attitudes toward and experience of virtual services. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the attitudes toward and experiences of virtual mental health and substance use services among youth drawn from clinical and non-clinical samples. METHOD: Four hundred nine youth completed a survey including questions about their attitudes toward and experience of virtual services. The survey included quantitative and open-ended questions on virtual care, as well as a mental health and substance use screener. RESULTS: The majority of youth with mental health or substance use challenges would be willing to consider individual virtual services, but fewer would consider group virtual services. However, many have not received virtual services. Youth are interested in accessing a wide variety of virtual services and other supportive wellness services. Advantages and disadvantages of virtual services are discussed, including accessibility benefits and technological barriers. DISCUSSION: As youth mental health and substance use services have rapidly gone virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential that we hear the perspectives of youth to promote service utilization among those in need. Diverse, accessible, technologically stable virtual services are required to meet the needs of different youth, possibly with in-person options for some youth. Future research, engaging youth in the research process, is needed to evaluate the efficacy of virtual services to plan for the sustainability of some virtual service gains beyond the pandemic period.","Hawke, Lisa D; Sheikhan, Natasha Y; MacCon, Karen; Henderson, Joanna",BMC Health Serv Res,669,20

From a total of 210 RNA samples extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs using spin columns, the Lyo-CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit detected 105/105 (100%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 96.55-100) positive samples and 104/105 (99.05%; 95% CI: 94.81-99.97) negative samples that were previously tested using commercial RT-qPCR. The estimated overall Kappa index was 0.991, reflecting an almost perfect concordance level between the two diagnostic tests. An initial validation test was also performed on 30 nasopharyngeal samples collected in lysis buffer, in which the Lyo-CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit detected 20/21 (95.24%; 95% CI: 76.18-99.88) positive samples and 9/9 (100%; 95% CI: 66.37-100) negative samples. The estimated Kappa index was 0.923, indicating a strong concordance between the test procedures. The Lyo-CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit was suitable for detecting a wide range of RT-qPCR-positive samples (cycle threshold range: 11.45-36.90) and dilutions of heat-inactivated virus (range: 2.5-100 copies/µL); no cross-reaction was observed with the other respiratory pathogens tested. We demonstrated that the performance of the Lyo-CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit was similar to that of commercial RT-qPCR, as the former was highly sensitive and specific, timesaving (1.5 h), inexpensive, and did not require sophisticated equipment. The use of this kit would reduce the time taken for diagnosis and facilitate molecular diagnosis in low-resource laboratories.","Curti, Lucía Ana; Primost, Ivana; Valla, Sofia; Ibañez Alegre, Daiana; Olguin Perglione, Cecilia; Repizo, Guillermo Daniel; Lara, Julia; Parcerisa, Ivana; Palacios, Antonela; Llases, María Eugenia; Rinflerch, Adriana; Barrios, Melanie; Pereyra Bonnet, Federico; Gimenez, Carla Alejandra; Marcone, Débora Natalia",Viruses,669,18

Serum ferritin generally represents a biomarker of choice when iron deficiency is suspected. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase-protein exhibiting elevated serum concentration in various inflammatory diseases. Here we focus on the role of serum ferritin for diagnostic and clinical management of patients with COVID-19 in comparison with other infectious and non-infectious diseases. METHODS: We examined scientific articles listed in PubMed reporting on ferritin in various infectious and non-infectious diseases. We then compared these results with nine current COVID-19 ferritin reports published in 2020. RESULTS: Several non-infectious, as well as non-COVID-19 infectious diseases, are characterised by a partly dramatic elevation of serum ferritin levels. All COVID-19 studies published between February and May 2020, which documented laboratory serum ferritin, indicate ferritin as a biomarker of COVID-19 severity in hospitalised patients. CONCLUSIONS: Serum ferritin may be considered both a prognostic and stratifying biomarker that can also contribute to therapeutic decision-making concerning patients with COVID-19. It should be emphasised, however, that most scientific reports refer to cohorts in the Asian region. Further validation in other cohorts is urgently required.","Kappert, Kai; Jahic, Amir; Tauber, Rudolf",Biomarkers,669,1

Recently, the guidelines for the management of Chinese HCC patients were updated. Objective: The past decade has witnessed a great improvement in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study reviews the recommendations in the 2019 Chinese guidelines and makes comparison with the practices from the Western world. Evidence Review: The updated recommendations on the surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment algorithm of HCC in the 2019 Chinese guidelines were summarized, and comparisons among the updated Chinese guidelines, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines were made. Findings: Besides imaging and pathological diagnoses, novel biomarkers like the seven-micro-RNA panel are advocated for early diagnoses and therapeutic efficacy evaluation in the updated Chinese guidelines. The China liver cancer (CNLC) staging system, proposed in the 2017 guidelines, continues to be the standard model for patient classification, with subsequent modifications and updates being made in treatment allocations. Compared to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system, the CNLC staging system employs resection, transplantation, and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for more progressed HCC. TACE in combination with other regional therapies like ablation or with systemic therapies like sorafenib are also encouraged in select patients in China. The systemic treatments for HCC have evolved considerably since lenvatinib, regorafenib, carbozantinib, ramucirumab and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)were first prescribed as first-line or second-line agents. Conclusions and Relevances: Novel biomarkers, imaging and operative techniques are recommended in the updated Chinese guideline. More aggressive treatment modalities are suggested for more progressed HBV-related HCC in China.","Xie, Di-Yang; Ren, Zheng-Gang; Zhou, Jian; Fan, Jia; Gao, Qiang",Hepatobiliary Surg Nutr,669,14

Specific attention was paid to respondents' exposure to different news media channels (public vs. commercial). We used data from a two-wave panel study with a 3-week interval (W1 at the start and W2 at the peak of the pandemic) and a large sample of the adult population in Flanders, Belgium (n = 870). The results of mixed ANOVAs indicate that besides a time-effect there was also a significant effect of the different types of news media exposure and respondents' support for protective health measures and behaviors. Whereas, perceived vulnerability to disease, feelings of loneliness, and solidarity were mostly determined by respondents' overall frequency of media exposure, support of governmental measures and self-reported health behaviors were mostly determined by the type of news media exposure. Respondents with a predominantly public/quality news media diet had the highest scores on these variables. A stepwise linear regression analysis with individual's change scores demonstrated that (self-)protective behavior was positively determined by respondents' age, solidarity, and the belief that the measures are necessary, but negatively determined by one's cumulative exposure to commercial/tabloid news media. This longitudinal study provides a new perspective on the role of news media in times of a public health crisis. It offers support for (A) the ""double bind hypothesis"" (i.e., while news media consumption encourages (self-)isolation, it fosters feelings of loneliness); and (B) the ""dual effects hypothesis"" (i.e., exposure to commercial/tabloid news media generates different outcomes than exposure to public/quality news media). Affective responses and socio-psychological perceptions are influenced by overall news media exposure, whereas support for the government and its handling of the crisis are mainly determined by one's selection of media channels, whereby audiences of public news media evaluate these outcomes more positively than the audiences of commercial news media channels.","Frissen, Thomas; De Coninck, David; Matthys, Koenraad; d039,; Haenens, Leen",Front Public Health,669,24

We report diverse virological characteristics of UK intensive care patients enrolled in the Immunoglobulin Domain of the REMAP-CAP randomised controlled trial that potentially influence treatment outcomes. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs collected pre-treatment was quantified by PCR. Antibody status was determined by spike-protein ELISA. B.1.1.7 was differentiated from other SARS-CoV-2 strains using allele-specific probes or restriction site polymorphism (SfcI) targeting D1118H. RESULTS: Of 1274 subjects, 90% were PCR-positive with viral loads 118-1.7x10 11 IU/ml. Median viral loads were 40-fold higher in those seronegative for IgG antibodies (n=354; 28%) compared to seropositives (n=939; 72%). Frequencies of B.1.1.7 increased from <1% in early November, 2020 to 82% of subjects in January 2021. Seronegative individuals with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher viral loads than seropositives (medians 5.8x10 6 and 2.0 x10 5 IU/ml respectively; p=2x10 -15). However, viral load distributions were elevated in both seronegative and seropositive subjects infected with B.1.1.7 (4.0x10 6 and 1.6x10 6 IU/ml respectively). CONCLUSIONS: High viral loads in seropositive B.1.1.7-infected subjects and resistance to seroconversion indicate less effective clearance by innate and adaptive immune responses.

During this ""quarantine"" period, it is important to understand the volume and types of emergency/trauma radiology cases to better prepare for the continuing and future pandemics. This study demonstrates new trends in pathologies and an overall increase in positive exams. METHODS: A retrospective review of emergency department's imaging during the initial two weeks of this state's quarantine period, 3/23/2020-4/5/2020 was compared to similar dates of the previous year (""pre-quarantine"" period), 3/25/2019-4/7/2019. One thousand emergency radiology and 991 trauma cases were evaluated. Of the emergency radiology cases 500 studies from each period were assessed, and from the trauma cases, 783 cases from pre-quarantine and 315 from the quarantine period were examined. Chi-square analysis was performed to assess for statistical significance. RESULTS: Overall there were 43.0% fewer emergency radiology studies performed during the quarantine period (n = 4530) compared to pre-quarantine period (n = 2585). Additionally, the number of positive cases was significantly higher (P = 0.0001) during the quarantine period (43.0%) compared to the pre-quarantine period (30.2%). Several trends in types of trauma were observed, including a significant increase in domestic violence during the quarantine period (P = 0.0081). DISCUSSION: Different volumes and types of emergency/trauma imaging cases were observed during the recent quarantine period.

Concurrent infection, which may require administration of a potentially nephrotoxic agent, can worsen AKI and lead to poor outcomes. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacillus associated with nosocomial infections, especially in severely immunocompromised and debilitated patients. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combination (TMP/SMX) is considered the treatment of choice but can itself lead to AKI, posing a significant challenge in the management of patients with concomitant COVID-19 and S. maltophilia pneumonia. CASE REPORT A 64-year-old male with end-stage renal disease and post renal transplant presented with severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 and was intubated upon admission. His renal functions were normal at the time of admission. The patient subsequently developed superimposed bacterial pneumonia with S. maltophilia requiring administration of TMP/SMX. However, TMP/SMX led to the development of AKI, which continued to worsen despite appropriate management including hemodialysis. This coincided with and most likely resulted in the patient's clinical deterioration and ultimate death. CONCLUSIONS The etiology of kidney disease involvement in patients with COVID-19 is still evolving and appears to be multifactorial. The condition can significantly worsen especially when nephrotoxic agents are given, probably due to a cumulative or synergistic effect. Great caution should be taken when administering nephrotoxic agents in the setting of COVID-19 as it can lead to adverse patient outcomes.","Mohamed, Mohamed A; Kaur, Jasleen; Wani, Farah; Kichloo, Asim; Bhanot, Ravinder",Am J Case Rep,669,20

METHODS: The most efficient pool size was determined to be five specimens using a web-based application. From this analysis, 25 experimental pools were created using 50 µL from one SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens (50 µL each) for a total volume of 250 µL. Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Positive pools were consequently split into individual specimens and tested by extraction and PCR. This method was also tested on an unselected group of 60 nasopharyngeal specimens grouped into 12 pools. RESULTS: All 25 pools were positive with cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0 and 5.03 Ct of the original individual specimens. The analysis of 60 specimens determined that 2 pools were positive followed by identification of 2 individual specimens among the 60 tested. This testing was accomplished while using 22 extractions/PCR tests, a savings of 38 reactions. CONCLUSIONS: When the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 10% or less, group testing will result in the saving of reagents and personnel time with an overall increase in testing capability of at least 69%.","Abdalhamid, Baha; Bilder, Christopher R; McCutchen, Emily L; Hinrichs, Steven H; Koepsell, Scott A; Iwen, Peter C",Am J Clin Pathol,669,32

Significant efforts to improving safety have beenemployed, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), preoperative COVID-19 testing, and recently the useof a modified surgical mask barrier. The objective of our cadaveric study is to reduce the risks of pathogen transmissionwith the use of readily available and innovative equipment as a means of creating a three-dimensional (3D) printed mask inaddition to a trocar system for use during endoscopic skull base surgery. Methods: Our study presents the ventilated upper airway endoscopic procedure mask (VPM), a 3D-printed mask with ananterior aperture fitted with a surgical glove with ports designed to allow for surgical instrumentation and side ports toaccommodate suction ventilation and an endotracheal tube. As an alternative, a modified laparoscopic surgery trocar servedas a port for instruments, and, on the contralateral side, rubber tubing was used over the endoscrub sheath to create anairtight seal. On cadaveric models, various surgical approaches were performed which each device to assess for surgicalmaneuverability including septoplasty, maxillary antrostomy, total ethmoidectomy, frontal sinusotomy, and sphenoidotomy.Surgical freedom (SF) and aerosolization were tested in both modalities. Results: The VPM allowed the unimpeded performance of the above-mentioned surgical approaches, using both two- andfour-handed techniques, with excellent surgical maneuverability and access, while maintaining a continuous facial seal.Debris and smoke were ventilated with a size 8-Frazier tip suction, and ambient gas was additionally suctioned by thenegative-pressure VPM. SF with the VPM was equivalent (1.0 cm2 ) to the SF with no mask. With the presence of a posterior septectomy, the endoscopic endonasal trocar (EET) system was effective for posteriorsurgical procedures, allowing access to critical paramedian structures (clivus, sella, and tuberculum), and afforded asuperior surgical seal, but was limited in terms of visualization and maneuverability during anterior approaches. For thisreason, aerosolization studies were only performed in the posterior nasal cavity with the EET. SF was found to be reducedby 55% (SF = 0.45 cm2 ), and surgery anterior to the sphenoid rostrum was limited when using the trocar system. Aerosolization was reduced using both the VPM and EET. During anterior surgery, the VPM reduced particle spillage by 86%.During posterior surgery, the VPM reduced overall particle spillage by 71%, while the EET reduced spillage by 97%.Conclusion: The VPM mask allows for a sealed surgical barrier during endoscopic skull base surgery and may play a criticalrole in advancing skull base surgery in the COVID-19 era. The EET may be a useful alternative for binarial procedures in theposterior nasal cavity and in instances where 3D printing is not available. Additionally, considering the ongoing pandemic,PPE shortage is a serious concern. The VPM may serve as a renewable alternative with various applications. In the future,our team will be performing studies to validate these preliminary findings.","Soriano, R. M. M.; Helman, S. N.; Tomov, M. L.; Serpooshan, V.; Levy, J. M.; Pradilla, G.; Solares, C.

This study investigated the relationship between serum interleukin (IL)-18, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and alpha defensin levels and the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 100 patients who were admitted to the chest diseases department and intensive care unit of our hospital and diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal swab samples between March 24 and May 31, 2020. The control group consisted of 50 nonsymptomatic health workers with negative real-time PCR results in routine COVID-19 screening in our hospital. RESULTS: Serum alpha defensin, IL-1Ra, and IL-18 levels were significantly higher in patients who developed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to patients who did not (p < .001 for all). Alpha defensin, IL-1Ra, and IL-18 levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with and without MAS or ARDS when compared to the control group (p < .001 for all). When the 9 patients who died were compared with the 91 surviving patients, IL-1Ra and IL-18 levels were found to be significantly higher in the nonsurvivors (p < .001).

This case report with a literature review emphasizes a unique presentation of COVID-19 that is highly important for health care providers to consider when treating their patients. CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old Caucasian male patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of dyspnea on exertion after his wife's recent diagnosis of COVID-19. He additionally had experienced a couple of episodes of self-resolving diarrhea a few days before presentation. Based on the patient's clinical presentation and the laboratory workup identifying an elevated D-dimer, a computed tomography angiogram of the chest was obtained, which was significant for moderately large, bilateral pulmonary emboli with a saddle embolus, and an associated small, left lower lobe, pulmonary infarct. Ultrasound of the lower extremity showed non-occlusive deep vein thrombosis at the distal left femoral vein to the left popliteal vein. The patient was additionally diagnosed with COVID-19 when the results of the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test returned as positive. The patient was admitted to the COVID unit, and he was started on an intravenously administered, unfractionated heparin drip for management of his bilateral pulmonary emboli and deep vein thrombosis. The patient's clinical condition improved significantly with anticoagulation, and he was observed in the hospital for 3 days, after which he was discharged home on the enoxaparin bridge with warfarin. Post-discharge telephone calls at day 10 and week 4 revealed that the patient was appropriately responding to anticoagulation treatment and had no recurrence of his symptoms related to venous thromboembolism and COVID-19. CONCLUSION: As COVID-19 continues to lead to significant mortality, more data is emerging that is exposing its perplexing pathogenicity. Meanwhile, the presentation of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 remains an unusual finding. It is imperative for health care providers to be mindful of this unique association to make necessary diagnostic evaluations and provide appropriate treatment for the patients.","Bhatt, Harshil; Singh, Sandeep",J Med Case Rep,669,16

It is possible that it is behavioural relevance rather than object plausibility per se which drives this effect. Here, we manipulated the biological relevance of objects (face or a non-face) and tested whether object relevance affects behavioural sensitivity and neural responses to depth-position. In a first experiment, we presented human observers with disparity-defined faces and non-faces, and observers were asked to judge the depth position of the target under signal-noise and clear (fine) task conditions. In the second experiment, we concurrently measured behavioural and fMRI responses to depth. We found that behavioural performance varied across stimulus conditions such that they were significantly worse for the upright face than the inverted face and the random shape in the SNR task, but worse for the random shape than the upright face in the feature task. Pattern analysis of fMRI responses revealed that activity of FFA was distinctly different during depth judgments of the upright face versus the other two stimuli, with its responses (and to a stronger extent, those of V3) appearing functionally-relevant to behavioural performance. We speculate that FFA is not only involved in object analysis, but exerts considerable influence on stereoscopic mechanisms as early as in V3 based on a broader appreciation of the stimulus' behavioural relevance.Significance StatementWe asked how disparity sensitivity is modulated by object (biological) relevance using behavioural and neuroimaging paradigms. We show that behavioural sensitivity to depth-position changes in biological (face) vs non-biological (random surface) contexts, and that these changes are task-dependent. Imaging results highlight a potentially key role of the fusiform region for governing the modulation of stereo encoding by object relevance. These findings highlight powerful interactions between object recognition mechanisms and stereoencoding, such that the utility of disparity information may be up/down weighed depending on the biological relevance of the object.","Chou, Idy W Y; Ban, Hiroshi; Chang, Dorita H F",ENeuro,669,16

COVID-19 vaccination programme success will rely on public willingness to be vaccinated. METHODS: We used a multi-methods approach - involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews - to investigate parents' and guardians' views on the acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine. 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16 + years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey participants were interviewed. FINDINGS: Most survey participants reported they would likely accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Definitely 55.8%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%) and their child/children (Definitely 48.2%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%). Less than 4% of survey participants reported that they would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Survey participants were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves than their child/children. Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were almost 3 times more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children than White British, White Irish and White Other participants. Survey participants from lower-income households were also more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine. In open-text survey responses and interviews, self-protection from COVID-19 was reported as the main reason for vaccine acceptance. Common concerns identified in open-text responses and interviews were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, mostly prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine. CONCLUSION: Information on how COVID-19 vaccines are developed and tested, including their safety and efficacy, must be communicated clearly to the public.

Aiming to understand a host genetic component of COVID-19, we focused on variants in genes encoding proteases and genes involved in innate immunity that could be important for susceptibility and resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of sequence data of coding regions of FURIN, PLG, PRSS1, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes in 143 unrelated individuals from Serbian population identified 22 variants with potential functional effect. In silico analyses (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutPred2 and Swiss-Pdb Viewer) predicted that 10 variants could impact the structure and/or function of proteins. These protein-altering variants (p.Gly146Ser in FURIN; p.Arg261His and p.Ala494Val in PLG; p.Asn54Lys in PRSS1; p.Arg52Cys, p.Gly54Asp and p.Gly57Glu in MBL2; p.Arg47Gln, p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His in OAS1) may have predictive value for inter-individual differences in the response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, we performed comparative population analysis for the same variants using extracted data from the 1000 Genomes project. Population genetic variability was assessed using delta MAF and Fst statistics. Our study pointed to 7 variants in PLG, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes with noticeable divergence in allelic frequencies between populations worldwide. Three of them, all in MBL2 gene, were predicted to be damaging, making them the most promising population-specific markers related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Comparing allelic frequencies between Serbian and other populations, we found that the highest level of genetic divergence related to selected loci was observed with African, followed by East Asian, Central and South American and South Asian populations. When compared with European populations, the highest divergence was observed with Italian population. In conclusion, we identified 4 variants in genes encoding proteases (FURIN, PLG and PRSS1) and 6 in genes involved in the innate immunity (MBL2 and OAS1) that might be relevant for the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Klaassen, Kristel; Stankovic, Biljana; Zukic, Branka; Kotur, Nikola; Gasic, Vladimir; Pavlovic, Sonja; Stojiljkovic, Maja",Infect Genet Evol,669,16

We supposed radioiodinated CO-1686 would function as a useful tool for monitoring EGFR L858R/T790M mutations. To aid in patient selection before therapy with EGFR-TKIs, this study aimed to develop a 125I-labeled derivative of CO-1686, N-{3-[(2-{[4-(4-acetylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-methoxyphenyl]amino}-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidine-4-yl] amino}-5-([125I]iodophenyl)acrylamide ([125I]ICO1686) and evaluate its selectivity toward EGFR L858R/T790M. Radiosynthesis was performed by iododestannylation of the corresponding tributylstannyl precursor with [125I]NaI and N-chlorosuccinimide. The selectivity of the tracer for detecting EGFR L858R/T790M was evaluated using three relevant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines-H1975, H3255 and H441 overexpressing the dual mutation EGFR L858R/T790M, active mutant EGFR L858R and wild-type EGFR, respectively. The nonradioactive ICO1686 and the precursor compound were successfully synthesized. A novel radiolabeled probe, [125I]ICO1686, was prepared with high radiochemical yield (77%) and purity (>99%). ICO1686 exhibited high cytotoxicity toward H1975 (IC50 0.20 ± 0.05 µM) and H3255 (IC50 0.50 ± 0.21 µM), which is comparable to that of CO-1686. In contrast, the cytotoxicity of ICO1686 toward H441 was 10-fold lower than that toward H1975. In the cell uptake study, the radioactivity uptake of [125I]ICO1686 in H1975 was 101.52% dose/mg, whereas the uptakes in H3255 and H441 were 33.52 and 8.95% dose/mg, respectively. The uptake of [125I]ICO1686 in H1975 was greatly reduced to 45.61% dose/mg protein by treatment with excess CO-1686. In vivo biodistribution study of the radiotracer found that its accumulation in H1975 tumor (1.77 ± 0.43% ID/g) was comparable to that in H3255 tumor (1.63 ± 0.23% ID/g) and the accumulation in H1975 tumor was not reduced by pretreatment with an excess dose of CO-1686. Although this radiotracer exhibited highly specific in vitro uptake in target cancer cells, structural modification is required to improve in vivo biodistribution.","Fawwaz, Muammar; Mishiro, Kenji; Nishii, Ryuichi; Sawazaki, Izumi; Shiba, Kazuhiro; Kinuya, Seigo; Ogawa, Kazuma",Molecules (Basel),669,29

Classification of patients with influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) using the current definitions for invasive fungal diseases has proven difficult, and our aim was to develop case definitions for IAPA that can facilitate clinical studies. METHODS: A group of 29 international experts reviewed current insights into the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of IAPA and proposed a case definition of IAPA through a process of informal consensus. RESULTS: Since IAPA may develop in a wide range of hosts, an entry criterion was proposed and not host factors. The entry criterion was defined as a patient requiring ICU admission for respiratory distress with a positive influenza test temporally related to ICU admission. In addition, proven IAPA required histological evidence of invasive septate hyphae and mycological evidence for Aspergillus. Probable IAPA required the detection of galactomannan or positive Aspergillus culture in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or serum with pulmonary infiltrates or a positive culture in upper respiratory samples with bronchoscopic evidence for tracheobronchitis or cavitating pulmonary infiltrates of recent onset. The IAPA case definitions may be useful to classify patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), while awaiting further studies that provide more insight into the interaction between Aspergillus and the SARS-CoV-2-infected lung. CONCLUSION: A consensus case definition of IAPA is proposed, which will facilitate research into the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of this emerging acute and severe Aspergillus disease, and may be of use to study CAPA.","Verweij, Paul E; Rijnders, Bart J A; Brüggemann, Roger J M; Azoulay, Elie; Bassetti, Matteo; Blot, Stijn; Calandra, Thierry; Clancy, Cornelius J; Cornely, Oliver A; Chiller, Tom; Depuydt, Pieter; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Janssen, Nico A F; Kullberg, Bart-Jan; Lagrou, Katrien; Lass-Flörl, Cornelia; Lewis, Russell E; Liu, Peter Wei-Lun; Lortholary, Olivier; Maertens, Johan; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Nguyen, M Hong; Patterson, Thomas F; Rogers, Thomas R; Schouten, Jeroen A; Spriet, Isabel; Vanderbeke, Lore; Wauters, Joost; van de Veerdonk, Frank L",Intensive care med,669,15

Currently, there are few preclinical animal models that suitably represent infection, as the main point of entry to human cells is via human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is not present in typical preclinical mouse strains. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 is highly virulent and unsafe for use in many research facilities. Here we describe the development of a preclinical animal model using intranasal administration of ACE2 followed by non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PsV) challenge. METHODS: To specifically generate our SARS-CoV-2 PsV, we used a lentivirus system. Following co-transfection with a packaging plasmid containing HIV Gag and Pol, luciferase-expressing lentiviruses, and a plasmid carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 PsVs can be isolated and purified. To better understand and maximize the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 PsV, we generated PsV carrying spike protein variants known to have varying human ACE2 binding properties, including 19 deletion (19del) and 19del + D614G. RESULTS: Our system demonstrated the ability of PsVs to infect the respiratory passage of mice following intranasal hACE2 transduction. Additionally, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo manipulability of our system using recombinant receptor-binding domain protein to prevent PsV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our PsV system is able to model SARS-CoV-2 infections in a preclinical mouse model and can be used to test interventions or preventative treatments.

The impact of the disease, while it has been relatively low in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as of May 2020, is feared to be potentially devastating given the less developed and fragmented healthcare system in the continent. In addition, most emergency measures practised may not be effective due to their limited affordability as well as the communal way people in SSA live in relative isolation in clusters of large as well as smaller population centres. METHODS: To address the acute need for estimates of the potential impacts of the disease once it sweeps through the African region, we developed a process-based model with key parameters obtained from recent studies, taking local context into consideration. We further used the model to estimate the number of infections within a year of sustained local transmissions under scenarios that cover different population sizes, urban status, effectiveness and coverage of social distancing, contact tracing and usage of cloth face mask. RESULTS: We showed that when implemented early, 50% coverage of contact tracing and face mask, with 33% effective social distancing policies can bringing the epidemic to a manageable level for all population sizes and settings we assessed. Relaxing of social distancing in urban settings from 33% to 25% could be matched by introduction and maintenance of face mask use at 43%. CONCLUSIONS: In SSA countries with limited healthcare workforce, hospital resources and intensive care units, a robust system of social distancing, contact tracing and face mask use could yield in outcomes that prevent several millions of infections and thousands of deaths across the continent.","Siraj, Amir; Worku, Alemayehu; Berhane, Kiros; Aregawi, Maru; Eshetu, Munir; Mirkuzie, Alemnesh; Berhane, Yemane; Siraj, Dawd",,669,16

Benchmark calculations of the absolute reduction potential of ferricenium/ferrocene couple, the IUPAC-proposed reference in nonaqueous solution, include the B3LYP/6-31G(d)/LanL2TZf protocol. We used this procedure to calculate ionization energies and reduction potentials for a comprehensive set of ferrocene derivatives. The protocol works very well for a number of derivatives. However, a significant discrepancy (>1 V) between experimental and calculated data was detected for selected cases. Three variables were assessed to detect an origin of the observed failure: density functional, basis set, and solvation model. It comes out that the Hartree-Fock exchange fraction in hybrid-DFT methods is the main source of the error. The accidental errors were observed for other hybrid models like PBE0, BHandHLYP, and M06-2X. Therefore, hybrid DFT methods should be used with caution, or pure functionals (BLYP or M06L) may be used instead.","Toma, Mateja; Kuvek, Tea; Vrcek, Valerije",J Phys Chem A,669,22

Recognizing this, the Global Initiative for Asthma neither recommends SABA monotherapy nor regards this formulation as a preferred reliever. Many health systems and healthcare professionals (HCPs) experience practical issues in implementing guidelines. Clear quality standards can drive improvements in asthma care and encourage implementation of global and national medical guidelines. METHODS: A steering group of global asthma experts came together between May and September 2019 to develop quality statements codifying the minimum elements of good quality asthma care. These statements were either evidence based (when robust evidence was available) or reflected a consensus based on clinical expertise and experience of the group. RESULTS: The quality statements (and associated essential criteria) developed emphasize key elements concerning (1) objective diagnosis specific to individual symptoms, (2) treatment appropriate to the long-term management of asthma as an inflammatory disease, consistent with evidence-based recommendations, (3) controlled dispensing of SABA canisters and monitoring to prevent overuse, (4) regular review of patients after treatment initiation or change, and (5) follow-up of patients in primary care after treatment for an exacerbation in a hospital or an emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: The steering group proposes quality statements that national and local clinical groups can implement as quantitative quality standards that are appropriate to their local circumstances, including during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. By translating these statements into locally relevant quality standards, primary care physicians and HCPs can encourage optimal management and reduce preventable healthcare interactions. The evidence-based evolution of care encapsulated in these statements will further engender high-quality, patient-centered holistic management that addresses asthma as an inflammatory disease. In particular, the statements empower self-management by patients and encourage health-promoting behaviors, which are essential to reduce exacerbations, the primary goal of asthma management.","Kaplan, Alan G; Correia-de-Sousa, Jaime; McIvor, Andrew",Adv Ther,669,7

Therefore, they are given priority for the COVID-19 vaccine in the national COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Indonesia. However, while the daily number of new COVID-19 cases remains high, and data regarding the efficacy of the vaccine in healthcare settings remain unavailable, vaccinated HCWs remain at risk of COVID-19 infection and further transmission. OBJECTIVE: To identify cases of COVID-19 among vaccinated HCWs at Siloam Teaching Hospital, Indonesia via active and passive surveillance conducted by the hospital's COVID-19 infection prevention and control unit. RESULTS: Of 1040 HCWs who had received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, 13 (1.25%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction between 2 and 11 days (median 5 days) after the second vaccination. CONCLUSION: Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among vaccinated HCWs soon after the second vaccination indicates that HCWs remain at risk of COVID-19. Therefore, the presence of symptoms soon after full vaccination cannot be considered as vaccine-related symptoms, and regular COVID-19 testing should be conducted among HCWs.","Cucunawangsih, Cucunawangsih; Wijaya, Ratna Sari; Lugito, Nata Pratama Hardjo; Suriapranata, Ivet",Int J Infect Dis,669,16

Methods: Two healthy volunteers were randomized to control (six liters per minute by low-flow nasal cannula), NIPPV, or HFNC using block randomization. NIPPV conditions were studied using continuous positive airway pressures of 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O with an FiO2 of 1.0 delivered via full-face mask. HFNC conditions included flow rates of 30 and 40 liters per minute with an FiO2 of 1.0 with and without coughing. HFNC and low-flow nasal cannula conditions were repeated with and without participants wearing a surgical mask. Six aerosol sizes (0.3, 1.0, 2.5, 5, and 10 µm) and total aerosol mass were measured at two feet and six feet from the participant's nasopharynx. Results: There was no significant difference in aerosol production between either HFNC or NIPPV and control. There was also no significant difference with the use of procedural mask over the HFNC. There was significant variation between the two participants, but in neither case was there a difference compared to control. There was an aerosol-time trend, but there does not appear to be a difference between either flow rate, pressure, or control. Furthermore, there was no accumulation of total aerosol particles over the total duration of the experiment in both HFNC and NIPPV conditions. Conclusions: HFNC and NIPPV did not increase aerosol production compared to six liters per minute by low-flow nasal cannula in this experiment involving healthy volunteers.This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS: Keyword searches of the Nexis Uni database identified 2,039 NH-related articles published from September 2018 to June 2020. Trends in the frequency of NH coverage and its tone (negative) and prominence (average words, daily article count, opinion piece) were examined. RESULTS: Findings indicate a dramatic rise in the number of NH articles published in the months following the first COVID-19 case, far exceeding previous levels. NH coverage became considerably more prominent, as the average number of words and daily articles on NHs increased. The proportion of negative articles largely remained consistent, though volume rose dramatically. Weekly analysis revealed acceleration in observed trends within the post-COVID-19 period itself. These trends, visible in all papers, were especially dramatic in The New York Times. DISCUSSION: Overall, findings reveal marked growth in the frequency and number of prominent and negative NH articles during the COVID-19 crisis. The increased volume of coverage has implications for the relative saliency of NHs to other issues during the pandemic. The increased prominence of coverage has implications for the perceived importance of addressing pre-existing deficits and the devastating consequences of the pandemic for NHs.","Miller, Edward Alan; Simpson, Elizabeth; Nadash, Pamela; Gusmano, Michael",,669,16

Pulmonary rehabilitation is aimed to improve dyspnoea, relieve anxiety and depression, reduce the incidence of related complications, as well as prevent and improve dysfunction. However, the impact of respiratory rehabilitation on discharged patients with COVID-19 is currently unclear, especially on patients who have been mechanically ventilated over 24 hours. Therefore, we aim to investigate the efficacy of respiratory rehabilitation programmes, initiated after discharge from the intensive care unit, on the physical and mental health and health-related quality of life in critical patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We have registered the protocol on PROSPERO and in the process of drafting it, we strictly followed the checklist of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Potocols. We will search the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, VIP information databases and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database. Additionally, ongoing trials in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov and ISRCTN registry will be searched as well. Studies in English or Chinese and from any country will be accepted regardless of study design. Two review authors will independently extract data and assess the quality of included studies. Continuous data are described as standard mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs. Dichotomous data from randomised controlled trials are described as risk ratio(RR) with 95% CIs; otherwise, it is described as odds ratio(OR) with 95% CIs. I2 and the Cochrane's Q statistic will be used to conduct heterogeneity assessment. The quality of evidence of main outcomes will be evaluated according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation(GRADE) criteria. When included studies are sufficient, we will conduct subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis; the publication bias will be statistically analysed using a funnel plot analysis and Egger's test.

Pathogen-resistant individuals will always remain in the host population. In turn, the virus can never completely eliminate the host population, because evolutionarily such an event is a dead end for the virus as an obligate intracellular parasite. A certain existential balance exists in the virus-host relationship. Against this backdrop, viral epidemics and pandemics only become manifest and egregious to human beings when tens and hundreds of thousands of people die and the question emerges what caused the high mortality peaks on the death chart. The answer seems clear; the emerging strain of the virus is new to the host population, and new mutations of the virus and natural selection will lead to a survival of only genetically resistant individuals in a host population. The dangers inherent to a novel virus are due to new features generally inthe molecular structure of proteins, which enable the virus to infect the cells of the host organism more intensively, dramatically challenging host immunity, and thus be transmitted more readily in the host population. In this article, we will concentrate on the facts currently available about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and try to predict its development and consequences based on the virus-host relationship. In fact, only two scenarios will occur simultaneously in the very near future: people who are genetically resistant to the virus will get sick, recover, and develop immunity, while people who are sensitive to the virus will need drugs and vaccines, which will have to be researched and developed if they are to recover. If the pandemic does not stop, in a few decades it is anticipated that SARS-CoV-2 will become as safe as the four non-severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E) currently circulating but causing low mortality in the human population.","Oberemok, Volodymyr V; Laikova, Kateryna V; Yurchenko, Kseniya A; Fomochkina, Irina I; Kubyshkin, Anatolii V",Inflamm Res,669,16

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Tracheostomy has an essential role in managing COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. However, limited data are available on how tracheostomy affects COVID-19 outcomes, and uncertainty surrounding risk of infectious transmission has led to divergent recommendations and practices. METHODS: It is a multicenter, retrospective study; data were collected on all tracheostomies performed in COVID-19 patients at 7 hospitals in 5 tertiary academic medical systems from February 1, 2020 to September 4, 2020. RESULT: Tracheotomy was performed in 118 patients with median time from intubation to tracheostomy of 22âdays (Q1-Q3: 18-25). All tracheostomies were performed employing measures to minimize aerosol generation, 78.0% by percutaneous technique, and 95.8% at bedside in negative pressure rooms. Seventy-eight (66.1%) patients were weaned from the ventilator and 18 (15.3%) patients died from causes unrelated to tracheostomy. No major procedural complications occurred. Early tracheostomy (&#8804;14âdays) was associated with decreased ventilator days; median ventilator days (Q1-Q3) among patients weaned from the ventilator in the early, middle and late groups were 21 (21-31), 34 (26.5-42), and 37 (32-41) days, respectively with P = 0.030. Compared to surgical tracheostomy, percutaneous technique was associated with faster weaning for patients weaned off the ventilator [median (Q1-Q3): 34 (29-39) vs 39 (34-51) days, P = 0.038]; decreased ventilator-associated pneumonia (58.7% vs 80.8%, P = 0.039); and among patients who were discharged, shorter intensive care unit duration [median (Q1-Q3): 33 (27-42) vs 47 (33-64) days, P = 0.009]; and shorter hospital length of stay [median (Q1-Q3): 46 (33-59) vs 59.5 (48-80) days, P = 0.001]. CONCLUSION: Early, percutaneous tracheostomy was associated with improved outcomes compared to surgical tracheostomy in a multi-institutional series of ventilated patients with COVID-19.","Mahmood, Kamran; Cheng, George Z; Van Nostrand, Keriann; Shojaee, Samira; Wayne, Max T; Abbott, Matthew; Nettlow, Darrell; Parish, Alice; Green, Cynthia L; Safi, Javeryah; Brenner, Michael J; De Cardenas, Jose",Ann Surg,669,17

METHODS: In this retrospective study we analyzed data from patients seen at three EDs and tested for COVID-19 between April 6 through May 4, 2020. The primary outcome was the test positivity rate by race and ethnicity, and the secondary outcome was 30 day in-hospital mortality. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine associations with COVID-19 test positivity. RESULTS: There were 526 patients tested for COVID-19, of whom 95 (18.1%) tested positive. The mean age of patients tested was 54.2 years, 54.7% were male, and 76.1% had at least one medical comorbidity. Black patients accounted for 40.7% of those tested but 16.8% of the positive tests, and Latinx patients accounted for 26.4% of those tested but 58.9% of the positive tests. The test positivity rate among Latinx patients was 40.3% (56/139) compared with 10.1% (39/387) among non-Latinx patients (p < 0.001). Latinx ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 test positivity (adjusted odds ratio 9.6, 95% confidence interval: 3.5-26.0). Mortality among Black patients was higher than non-Black patients (18.7% vs 1.3%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We report a significant disparity in COVID-19 adjusted test positivity rate and crude mortality rate among Latinx and Black patients, respectively. Results from ED-based testing can identify racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 testing, test positivity rates, and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection and can be used by health departments to inform policy.","Misa, Nana-Yaa; Perez, Berenice; Basham, Kellie; Fisher-Hobson, Essence; Butler, Brittany; King, Kolette; White, Douglas A E; Anderson, Erik S",Am. j. emerg. med,669,26

Initially, most COVID-19 cases were in China, but the virus has spread to more than 184 countries worldwide, and the United States currently has more cases than any other country. OBJECTIVE: With person-to-person spread expanding in the United States, we describe hospital preparedness for managing suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey focused on various elements of respiratory disease preparedness. SETTING: Critical access hospitals (CAHs) and acute-care hospitals (ACHs) in Idaho. METHODS: The electronic survey was sent to infection preventionists (IPs) and nurse administrators in 44 hospitals in Idaho. RESULTS: Overall, 32 (73%) hospitals responded to the survey. Participating facilities reported their preparedness with respect to existing, formalized structures for managing infectious disease incidents-specifically COVID-19-as well as availability of resources, such as isolation rooms and personal protective equipment, for safely managing suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals covered by the survey had varying levels of preparedness for managing COVID-19 cases, with differences across the various categories of interest in this study. Although the study reveals strengths, including in application of emergency management and infection control frameworks, it also suggests that other areas, such as consistent implementation of federal guidelines and requirements for infection prevention, are potential areas for strengthening preparedness for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens with pandemic potential.","Kanwar, Anubhav; Heppler, Susan; Kanwar, Kalpana; Brown, Christopher K",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,669,22

If the DL algorithm achieves a performance equivalent to that achieved by physicians in chest radiography (CR) diagnoses with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, the automatic interpretation of the CR with DL algorithms can significantly reduce the burden on clinicians and radiologists in sudden surges of suspected COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the DL algorithm for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on CR compared with formal radiology reports. This is a retrospective study of adult patients that were diagnosed as positive COVID-19 cases based on the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction among all the patients who were admitted to five emergency departments and one community treatment center in Korea from February 18, 2020 to May 1, 2020. The CR images were evaluated with a publicly available DL algorithm. For reference, CR images without chest computed tomography (CT) scans classified as positive for COVID-19 pneumonia were used given that the radiologist identified ground-glass opacity, consolidation, or other infiltration in retrospectively reviewed CR images. Patients with evidence of pneumonia on chest CT scans were also classified as COVID-19 pneumonia positive outcomes. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the DL algorithm for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on CR were 95.6%, and 88.7%, respectively. The area under the curve value of the DL algorithm for the detection of COVID-19 with pneumonia was 0.921. The DL algorithm demonstrated a satisfactory diagnostic performance comparable with that of formal radiology reports in the CR-based diagnosis of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. The DL algorithm may offer fast and reliable examinations that can facilitate patient screening and isolation decisions, which can reduce the medical staff workload during COVID-19 pandemic situations.","Jang, Se Bum; Lee, Suk Hee; Lee, Dong Eun; Park, Sin-Youl; Kim, Jong Kun; Cho, Jae Wan; Cho, Jaekyung; Kim, Ki Beom; Park, Byunggeon; Park, Jongmin; Lim, Jae-Kwang",PLoS One,669,22

We also reviewed our chronic dialysis cohort and renal transplant recipients who tested positive to assess incidence and outcomes. All patients presenting to nephrology services at the four main public hospitals were included. Information regarding demographics, co-morbidities, medical care, laboratory data, and outcomes were recorded. There were 86 patients referred with AKI, 48 required dialysis, and 47 died. There were 52 patients admitted to the intensive care unit with AKI (37 received dialysis, 1 of whom survived). In those presenting with AKI, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and HIV were the most common comorbidities.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, users get exposed to a massive amount of information about a new topic having a high level of uncertainty. In this paper, we analyze two social media that enforced opposite moderation methods, Twitter and Gab, to assess the interplay between news consumption and content regulation concerning COVID-19. We compare the two platforms on about three million pieces of content analyzing user interaction with respect to news articles. We first describe users' consumption patterns on the two platforms focusing on the political leaning of news outlets. Finally, we characterize the echo chamber effect by modeling the dynamics of users' interaction networks. Our results show that the presence of moderation pursued by Twitter produces a significant reduction of questionable content, with a consequent affiliation towards reliable sources in terms of engagement and comments. Conversely, the lack of clear regulation on Gab results in the tendency of the user to engage with both types of content, showing a slight preference for the questionable ones which may account for a dissing/endorsement behavior. Twitter users show segregation towards reliable content with a uniform narrative. Gab, instead, offers a more heterogeneous structure where users, independently of their leaning, follow people who are slightly polarized towards questionable news.","Etta, Gabriele; Cinelli, Matteo; Galeazzi, Alessandro; Valensise, Carlo Michele; Conti, Mauro; Quattrociocchi, Walter",,669,33

It has been suggested that many patients with positive RT-PCR 'missed' by antigen testing might be non-infectious. METHODS: In a real-world high-throughput setting for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, 494 patients were tested using RT-PCR as well as a single lateral flow antigen test (Ecotest, AssureTech, China). Where the results differed, virus viability was evaluated by cell culture. The test parameters were calculated with RT-PCR and RT-PCR adjusted on viability as reference standards. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of the used antigen test related to the RT-PCR only was 76.2%, specificity was 97.3%. However, 36 out of 39 patients 'missed' by the antigen test contained no viable virus. After adjusting on that, the sensitivity grew to 97.7% and, more importantly for disease control purposes, the negative predictive value reached 99.2%.

As regards number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related hospital submissions, deaths, and infected health care workers Denmark is not the hardest hit country compared to others. This cannot be explained by hardness of the restrictions alone. Several aspects concerning the person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood and require more experimental studies. The dogma is that virus transmission happens through either respiratory droplets or contact routes. However, it is likely not the whole truth, as we describe scenarios where droplets and/or direct contact cannot alone explain how all patients were infected. Aspects of the physiology of airborne transmission is considered, as several parameters are in play beyond particle size and respiratory rate.

However, these representations do not allow quick identifications of significant changes in the outbreak;a key information for estimating the needs for hospital and ICU beds, for decision-making, and resource allocation. Moreover, an epidemic is characterised by a heterogeneous evolution that depends on many unpredictable factors, coming from the virus itself or from its ecosystem. Simulations are very complex and based on hypotheses that are impossible to certify a priori, since each outbreak is different and has specific characteristics. A validation phase is necessary that may delay the usefulness of these tools. We tested a simpler method for monitoring the epidemic and rapidly predicting the peak. RESULTS: We present here a simple and easy-to-draw figure by plotting the daily rate of change in the number of patients as a function of time. This allows: (1) to rapidly identify the changes in the infection growth, (2) to extrapolate the regression lines for predicting the peaks, and (3) to use simple statistical models for identifying the significant inflexions and deriving the uncertainties. This figure predicted confidently the peak epidemic of the three waves in France. CONCLUSION: Plotting the daily rate of change in the number of patients as a function of time is a simple tool for monitoring an epidemic growth, allowing to quickly identify significant changes and to help in predicting the peak of the infection, with its confidence interval.","Squara, P.",Ann Intensive Care,669,23

Migrant populations are particularly vulnerable to these infections. Yet, literature is still scarce on the epidemiology of HIV-TB co-infection among migrants. In this study, we characterized native and migrant HIV patients followed in Portuguese hospitals who were diagnosed with TB, regarding their sociodemographic, clinical and genomic characteristics. Among 67 patients with HIV and TB diagnoses, there were 24 migrants, most from sub-Saharan Africa. Most patients had CD4+ T cell counts below 350 cells/µL, and were diagnosed simultaneously for HIV and TB. When compared to natives, migrants presented a higher proportion of non-B HIV-1 infections. Patients infected with these non-B HIV-1 strains presented higher viral loads, which can have an important impact for the transmissibility and pathogenicity of both diseases. Future studies should investigate different HIV strains and consequences for TB and HIV transmission and disease outcomes, especially among vulnerable populations.","Tavares, Ana; Pingarilho, Marta; Batista, Judite; Viveiros, Miguel; Dias, Sónia; Toscano, Cristina; Gomes, Perpétua; Abecasis, Ana B",AIDS res. hum. retroviruses,669,24

Methods: Descriptive study of a nosocomial COVID-19 outbreak registered in March-April 2020 at medical ward of onco-hematological patients in an Spanish hospital. Confirmed cases were hospitalized patients, healthcare and non-healthcare workers who tested positive by PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab. Results: Twenty-two COVID-19 cases (12 workers and 10 inpatients) were laboratory-confirmed. Initial cases were a healthcare provider and a visitor who tested positive. The median patients age was 73 years (range 62-88). The main reason of admission was haematological in 8 patients and oncologic in 2. All patients followed an immunosuppressive treatment, 5/10 with high-flow oxygen nebulizations. Five patients presented a moderate/serious evolution, and 5 patients died. The mean workers age was 42.1±10.9. One healthworker required Intensive Care Unit admission, and all of them recovered completely. Conclusions: In the hospital setting, close patients surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is essential, especially in immunosuppressed patients. Replacing nebulizations or high-flow oxygen therapies, when other equivalent options were available, to reduce dispersion, and controlling ventilation ducts, together with hygiene measures and an active follow-up on inpatients, visitors and workers appear to be important in preventing nosocomial outbreaks.","Bestilleiro, Rocío Seijo; Señaris, Diana Martinez; Rodríguez, María José Pereira; Vázquez, Rita Galeiras; Rodríguez, Raquel García; Rodriguez, María Teresa García; Martín, Cristina González; Pillado, María Teresa Seoane; Barreiro, Vanesa Balboa; Valiña, Valentín Valdés; Díaz, Sonia Pértega",Int J Med Sci,669,16

While these instances are minority responses to these orders, they nonetheless raise questions about the rationality of ecclesial belonging in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, I draw on the work of William James and W. E. B. Du Bois to articulate a conception of ecclesial belonging as a social epistemological process engaging a complex, fluid multiplicity of knowers of various scales. I argue that, in this view, ecclesial rationality involves the construction of a concatenation of internal and external practices individual believers and groups can traverse so long as they consistently satisfy a plurality of desiderata. I suggest that what is irrational about religious-based defiance of COVID-19 guidelines is the church-sanctioned severance of internal from external practices. I suggest that this behavior is supported by a failure to grasp the demands of ecclesial rationality rather than embrace them, and that this conception of rationality may have been eroded by the value-neutral skepticism of secular rationality. © 2021 Walter Scott Stepanenko, published by De Gruyter 2021.","Stepanenko, W.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the characteristics of COVID-19 disease in pregnant women and non-pregnant women are very similar. However, pregnant women with COVID-19 in the third trimester are more likely than their non-pregnant counterparts to require intensive care, though this may reflect a lower threshold for intervention in pregnant women rather than more serious disease. Compared with pregnant women without COVID-19, pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital have worse maternal outcomes, including death, although the absolute risk remains very low. Outcomes of neonates born to women positive for COVID-19 are generally very good, though iatrogenic preterm birth is more common.

However, its shortcomings such as broad torque ripple and variable switching frequency have offered several improvements like Space Vector Modulation (SVM) strategy, multilevel inverter (MLI) topology, etc. The conventional DTC which is fed by the two-level inverter has limited voltage vector, results in some difficulties to optimize the operation, especially at low operating speed. In contrast to MLI, the abundant of voltage vector has provided various amplitudes and angles that can overcome the problem of conventional DTC. Thus, this paper introduces the selected optimal voltage vector obtained from five-level Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) inverter that employs in DTC hysteresis-based to achieve better optimization that similar to the DTC-SVM. Initially, the research work begins with an investigation on the performance comparison between a DTC hysteresis-based between two-level inverter (conventional method) and a five-level CHB inverter (proposed method). Here, a DC generator acted as a load is employed to control the operating speed instead of the speed controller (speed controller is negligible). Hence, the DTC method is optimized by minimizing the torque ripple as well as retaining the torque control capability at constant torque region on several operating speed. The selected optimal vector from the look-up table DTC of five-level CHB inverter must be dynamically appropriate to any change of torque (increased or decreased torque). For simplicity, this paper will only discuss the experimental results for both topologies of drive system. From the experimental results, it is verified that the torque ripples by the proposed method have achieved 10% and 50% reduction at high and low operating speed respectively. It is found that the DTC hysteresis-based result simpler control method than DTC-SVM while maintaining similar output performance.","Tarusan, Siti Azura Ahmad; Jidin, Auzani; Jamil, Mohd Luqman Mohd",ISA Trans,669,22

There are various reports on neurological manifestations of COVID-19, which have attracted broad attention. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare complication of influenza and other viral infections and has been related to intracranial cytokine storm, which results in breach in blood-brain barrier leading to encephalitis like presentation. We report an unusual case of acute necrotizing encephalitis as a solitary presentation of COVID-19. Case description: We report a case of 35-year-old man from Bihar, presented to our emergency department in unconscious state, with high-grade fever and vomiting since last 5 days. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed a left parasellar-middle cranial fossa mass looks most likely like an invasive meningioma. Urgent noncontrast computed tomography scan (NCCT) brain showed that mass as well as hypodensities in both thalami and left caudate nucleus. As per our institutional protocol, clinical management of raised intracranial pressure was initiated. As there is no current evidence from any randomized control trails (RCTs) to recommend any specific treatment for suspected or confirmed patients with COVID-19 with acute necrotizing encephalitis.

Although men are primarily detected to be slightly more vulnerable in succumbing to the ongoing COVID-19 contagion, many researchers have recognized that women are facing more of the devastating brunt in secondary terms. Aside gendered health and social impacts, women are more disproportionately disadvantaged than men in economic terms, as they are predominantly found in the part-time and informal occupations, which have been closed down for months now since the emergence of the current global crisis. Also, since women form the vast proportion of the caregivers within the health sector, their role in handling the pandemic as frontline respondents at the hospitals put them in higher risks of contracting the disease. Despite this higher risk of infection, the peculiar attentions to women's health in the planning and rolling out of actions to contain the virus have been overlooked. Additionally, their unpaid domestic care works have also increased due to closure of schools and businesses, which have forced family members to stay at home for as long as movement control orders remain in place. In this confined state, the domestic violence against women have been recorded to be on the increase. To recommend measures that consider gendered dimensions of the current crisis, we have reviewed the various sex-based burdens and impacts of the pandemic, and proceeded to suggest necessary response actions to handle the situation. Particular emphasis is placed on the effects of the outbreak on women, and how the gendered flaws in the current response strategies could be avoided in managing future global crises.","Ayittey, Foster Kofi; Dhar, Bablu Kumar; Anani, Gideon; Chiwero, Nyasha Bennita",Health Care Women Int,669,1

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) infect only through the basolateral surface of these polarized epithelial cells and not through the apical surface. Prior infection with influenza virus rendered the cell susceptible to infection by VSV or SFV through either surface. The presence of both a permissive and a restrictive surface for virus entry in the same cell allowed us to determine how the influenza infection enhanced the subsequent infection of a second virus. Biochemical and morphological evidence showed that influenza haemagglutinin on the apical surface serves as a receptor for the superinfecting virus by binding to its sialic acid-bearing envelope proteins. Influenza virus also facilitates secondary virus infection in non-epithelial cells; baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21), which are normally resistant to infection by the coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus MHV-A59), could be infected via the haemagglutinin-sialic acid interaction. Facilitation of secondary virus infection requires only the sialic acid-binding properties of the haemagglutinin since the uncleaved haemagglutinin could also mediate virus entry.","Fuller, S D; von Bonsdorff, C H; Simons, K",The EMBO journal,669,1

Current guidelines recommend Rezum for prostates < 80 cc, but little data exist describing outcomes in patients with prostates ≥ 80 cc. We compare outcomes after Rezum between men with small < 80 cc (SP) and large ≥ 80 cc prostates (LP). METHODS: Patients undergoing Rezum between Jan 2017–Feb 2020 were subdivided by prostate volume (< 80, ≥ 80 cc). Outcomes were documented pre- and postoperatively. Descriptive analyses of urodynamics data (Qmax, PVR), symptom scores (AUA-SS, SHIM), disease management (medications, catheterization, retreatments), and clinical outcomes were conducted. RESULTS: 36 (17.6%) men had prostates ≥ 80 cc (LP mean prostate size 106.8 cc). LP men had improved Qmax and PVR postoperatively; those with longitudinal follow-up exhibited improved Qmax, PVR, and AUA-SS. After one year, alpha-blocker usage decreased significantly (LP 94.44–61.11%, p = 0.001, SP 73.96–46.15%, p = 0.001); other medication usage and self-catheterization rates remained unchanged. Compared to SP patients, differences in passing trial void (LP 94.44%, SP 93.45%), postoperative UTI (LP 19.44%, SP 10.12%), ED visits (LP 22.22%, SP 17.86%), readmissions (LP 8.33%, SP 4.76%), and retreatment (LP 8.33%, SP 4.76%) were insignificant. However, mean days to foley removal (LP 9, SP 5.71, p = 0.003) and urosepsis rates (LP 5.56%, SP 0.00%, p = 0.002) differed. CONCLUSION: In select LP patients, Rezum provided short-term symptomatic relief and improved voiding function comparable to SP patients. Postoperatively, though alpha-blocker usage decreased significantly, use of other medications did not change, and nearly two-thirds of patients still needed alpha-blockade. Further efforts should explore the possibility of expanding Rezum’s inclusion criteria.","Garden, Evan B.; Shukla, Devki; Ravivarapu, Krishna T.; Kaplan, Steven A.; Reddy, Avinash K.; Small, Alexander C.; Palese, Michael A.",World J Urol,669,16

However, vaccine-associated myocarditis has been reported. Two typical cases in terms of young age and after the second vaccination were admitted to our hospital with symptoms of worsening chest pain, ST elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and creatine kinase elevation. Emergency coronary angiography revealed no coronary arteries, and an endomyocardial biopsy showed no remarkable findings. Their symptoms were resolved within a few days of sufficient rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The ECG of Patient 1 showed typical change; therefore, the diagnosis of myocarditis was easy. However, the ECG of Patient 2 did not show typical change for myocarditis, and there was no abnormality in the wall motion on echocardiography. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), strain analysis by speckle-tracking echocardiography and serial ECG were useful for the diagnosis of myocarditis. This work shows that conducting early examinations with multimodality imaging and sufficient rest are needed to prevent the worsening of vaccine-associated myocarditis.

In Canada, investigations of zoonotic disease incidents are often conducted by public health inspectors (PHIs). However, little is known about PHIs' knowledge of transmission of zoonotic pathogens, their perceptions of zoonotic disease importance or their education regarding zoonotic diseases. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the knowledge, perceptions and education of Canadian PHIs regarding zoonotic diseases. Data were collected from December 2008–January 2009 using an internet‐based survey distributed to members of the Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors national listserv. Responses were received from 229 PHIs in four provinces, with a response rate of approximately 20%. The majority of respondents reported at least 10 years of experience in the public health sector, 80% (181/225) were in frontline positions, and 62% (137/222) were routinely involved in investigations of infectious diseases. Two‐thirds believed that the importance of zoonotic diseases with regards to public health would increase in the next 5 years. Whilst most respondents were able to correctly identify animals capable of directly transmitting common zoonotic pathogens, there were gaps in knowledge, particularly with regard to rabies and transmission of gastrointestinal pathogens by companion animals. PHIs tended to feel that their training on zoonotic diseases prior to working as PHIs was deficient in some areas, or left some room for improvement. Their responses also suggested that there is a need for improvement in both the quantity and the quality of continuing education on zoonotic diseases. In particular, less than one‐third of PHIs received ongoing continuing education regarding zoonotic diseases, and of those that did, nearly two‐thirds rated the quantity and quality as only fair.","Snedeker, K.

With ongoing uncertainty, key factors to appreciate for patient and population health include the continued touchstones of empathy and compassion, the use of effective risk communication with shared clinical decision-making when appropriate, attention to resource stewardship and vulnerable populations, importance of health literacy and need for critical assessment of media and medical literature to mitigate misinformation, and the hidden costs of the pandemic on children. Although there has been some international concern for allergic reactions to the recently approved Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, neither the United States Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorizations exclude patients without a specific allergy to a vaccine component from receiving vaccination. SUMMARY: Practical adjustments to practice during COVID-19 are feasible and acceptable.

As with the more extensively studied murine and human DCs, porcine DC can be generated from bone marrow haematopoietic cells or monocytes, and have been analysed in various immunological and non-immunological tissues. Both conventional DC (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) have been characterized. The function of porcine monocyte-derived DC has not only been characterized in terms of antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation, but also their response to various ligands of pattern recognition receptors. These have been characterized in terms of the induction of DC maturation and pro-inflammatory, Th1-like or Th2-like cytokines secretion. Porcine pDC most effectively sense virus infections and are characterized by their capacity to produce large quantities of IFN-α and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-12. As such, the DC family as a whole is a powerful ally in the host battle against pathogen attack. Nevertheless, DC in particular tissue environments or under particular stimuli can down-regulate immune response development. This is not only important for preventing over-activation of the immune system and also for ensuring tolerance against self or “friendly” substances including food components, but may also be used as a mechanism of pathogens to evade immune responses.","Summerfield, Artur; McCullough, Kenneth C.",Dev Comp Immunol,669,24

METHODS: We collected paired NP and OP swabs separately from pediatric and adult patients with influenza-like illness or severe acute respiratory illness at two respiratory surveillance sites in Kenya. The specimens were tested for eight respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Positivity for a specific virus was defined as detection of viral nucleic acid in either swab. RESULTS: Of 2,331 paired NP/OP specimens, 1,402 (60.1%) were positive for at least one virus, and 393 (16.9%) were positive for more than one virus. Overall, OP swabs were significantly more sensitive than NP swabs for adenovirus (72.4% vs. 57.6%, p<0.01) and 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (91.2% vs. 70.4%, p<0.01). NP specimens were more sensitive for influenza B virus (83.3% vs. 61.5%, p = 0.02), parainfluenza virus 2 (85.7%, vs. 39.3%, p<0.01), and parainfluenza virus 3 (83.9% vs. 67.4%, p<0.01). The two methods did not differ significantly for human metapneumovirus, influenza A (H3N2) virus, parainfluenza virus 1, or respiratory syncytial virus. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivities were variable among the eight viruses tested; neither specimen was consistently more effective than the other. For respiratory disease surveillance programs using qRT-PCR that aim to maximize sensitivity for a large number of viruses, collecting combined NP and OP specimens would be the most effective approach.","Kim, Curi; Ahmed, Jamal A.; Eidex, Rachel B.; Nyoka, Raymond; Waiboci, Lilian W.; Erdman, Dean; Tepo, Adan; Mahamud, Abdirahman S.; Kabura, Wamburu; Nguhi, Margaret; Muthoka, Philip; Burton, Wagacha; Breiman, Robert F.; Njenga, M.

We sought to identify individuals with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the early weeks of the US epidemic. METHODS: All of Us study participants in all 50 US states provided blood specimens during study visits from 2 January to 18 March 2020. Participants were considered seropositive if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies with the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 ELISA in a sequential testing algorithm. The sensitivity and specificity of these ELISAs and the net sensitivity and specificity of the sequential testing algorithm were estimated, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The estimated sensitivities of the Abbott and EUROIMMUN assays were 100% (107 of 107 [95% CI: 96.6%–100%]) and 90.7% (97 of 107 [83.5%–95.4%]), respectively, and the estimated specificities were 99.5% (995 of 1000 [98.8%–99.8%]) and 99.7% (997 of 1000 [99.1%–99.9%]), respectively.

Soluble endothelial protein C receptor (sEPCR), which is the soluble form of EPCR, reduces the anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory activity of activated protein C. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between sEPCR and the laboratory parameters and thorax computed tomography (CT) findings in the course of COVID-19. Twenty-five laboratory-confirmed [reverse transcription-quantitative polimerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) positive] and 24 clinically diagnosed (RT-qPCR negative) COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the study. Blood specimens were collected for sEPCR and haematological and biochemical parameter measurement. Thorax CT was performed to detect COVID-19 findings. These parameters from RT-qPCR positive and negative patients were then compared. Although there was no difference between the groups in terms of symptoms, the time between the onset of symptoms and the admission time was shorter in RT-qPCR positive group (Pâ=â0.000). sEPCR levels were significantly higher in the RT-qPCR positive group (Pâ=â0.011). Patients with ground-glass opacity and bilateral involvement on thorax CT have higher serum sEPCR levels (Pâ=â0.012 and 0.043, respectively).

Most of the industries within the catchment area of river Damodar have been closed; as a result, significant changes have been reflected throughout the stretch of river Damodar. The main objective of the study is to analyze the impact of lockdown on the water quality of river Damodar. A total of 55 samples was collected from eleven different confluence sites of nallas with the main river channel during and pre-lockdown period. The relevant methods like WQI, TSI, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and “t” test have been applied to evaluate the physical, chemical, and biological status of river water. The result of “t” test indicated that there are significant differences (α = 0.05) of each parameter between pre and during lockdown. Water quality index (WQI) is used for analysis of drinking water quality suitability followed by BIS. The values of WQI showed “very poor” (S1, S2, S3, S6, S7, and S11) to “unfit for drinking” (S4, S5, S8, S9, and S10) of river water during pre-monsoon season. The nutrient enrichment status of the river was analyzed by Trophic State Index (TSI) method and it shows the “High” eutrophic condition with a heavy concentration of algal blooms in almost an entire stretch. During lockdown, nutrient supplies like TN and TP have been reduced and is designated as “Low” (S1, S2) to “Moderate” (S3 to S11) eutrophic condition of middle stretch of Damodar.

Data from the Prospective Pediatric CRRT (ppCRRT) registry observed children < 10 kg had a lower survival rate than children > 10 kg (44% vs. 64%, p < 0.001). A CKRT device designed specifically for small children could improve outcomes. The Cardio-Renal Pediatric Dialysis Emergency Machine (CARPEDIEM™) is specifically dedicated to providing CKRT for newborns and small infants. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis comparing patient severity of illness and outcomes between the ppCRRT and CARPEDIEM registries, involving 6 Italian pediatric intensive care units. Thirty-eight subjects from the CARPEDIEM registry and 84 subjects from the ppCRRT registry < 10 kg were screened for comparison. We compared patient outcomes with a weight-matched cohort (< 5 kg) of 34 patients from the CARPEDIEM registry and 48 patients from the ppCRRT registry. RESULTS: The ppCRRT subjects had higher rates of vasoactive medication at CKRT initiation. Survival to CKRT termination was higher for CARPEDIEM subjects (33/34 vs. 21/48, p < 0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression showed that CARPEDIEM registry cohort was the only variable to retain an association with survival to CKRT discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest children receiving CKRT using CARPEDIEM have excellent survival.

COVID-19 has claimed more than two million lives globally and over 450,000 in the United States. Two of the leading vaccines, which have provided hope that an end to the devastating effects of the pandemic may be in sight, are messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines, a novel vaccine platform that has received authorization for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). To overcome the inherent instability of the mRNA molecule under physiological conditions, mRNA is first modified and then encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that effectively deliver the mRNA into cells at the injection site and the draining lymph nodes for translation into viral protein by the host protein synthesis machinery [1–3]. Placing the mRNA, which contains N1-methylpseudouridine instead of uridine, between two untranslated regions (UTRs) protects it from degradation, and its polyadenylation, or the addition of adenosine monophosphates, at the 3’end, further stabilizes the molecule; at the 5’end, the addition of a trinucleotide cap 1 analog ((m2 7,3′-O)Gppp(m2′-O) ApG) serves as a recognition signal for the efficient binding of host cellular ribosomes that translate the mRNA [4]. The transiently expressed, mainly by dendritic cells and subcapsular sinus macrophages, membrane-bound spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is then recognized by immune cells as a foreign antigen, eliciting both T-cell and B-cell responses to generate neutralizing antibodies, which are thought to contribute to protection against COVID-19 [3].","Hatziantoniou, Sophia; Maltezou, Helena C.; Tsakris, Athanasios; Poland, Gregory A.; Anastassopoulou, Cleo",Vaccine,669,16

Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious, air-borne, emerging, viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic affected more than 210 countries and territories worldwide including Saudi Arabia. There are contradictory research papers about the correlation between meteorological parameters and incidence of COVID-19 in some countries worldwide. The current study investigates the impact of outdoor and indoor meteorological conditions on the daily recorded COVID-19 cases in western region (Makkah and Madinah cities) of Saudi Arabia over a period of 8 months from March to October 2020. Reports of the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from the webpage of Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) were used. Considering, the incubation period of COVID-19 which ranged from 2 to 14 days, the relationships between daily COVID-19 cases and outdoor meteorological factors (temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed) using a lag time of 10 days are investigated. The results showed that the highest daily COVID-19 cases in Makkah and Madinah were reported during the hottest months of the year (April–July 2020) when outdoor temperature ranged from 26.51 to 40.71 °C in Makkah and of 23.89–41.20 °C in Madinah, respectively. Partial negative correlation was detected between outdoor relative humidity and daily recorded COVID-19 cases. No obvious correlation could be demonstrated between wind speed and daily COVID-19 cases. This indicated that most of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in the cool, air-conditioned, dry, and bad-ventilated indoor environment in the investigated cities. These results will help the epidemiologists to understand the correlation between both outdoor and indoor meteorological conditions and SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. These findings would be also a useful supplement to assist the local healthcare policymakers to implement and apply a specific preventive measures and education programs for controlling of COVID-19 transmission.","Habeebullah, Turki M.; Abd El-Rahim, Ibrahim H.A.; Morsy, Essam A.",J Environ Manage,669,16

This study was aimed to quantify serum IgG and IgA neutralizing antibodies after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in baseline SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthcare workers. METHODS: The study population consisted of 181 SARSCoV-2 seronegative healthcare workers (median age 42 years, 59.7% women), receiving two doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (Comirnaty). Serum samples were collected before receiving the first vaccine dose, 21 days (before the second vaccine dose) and 50 days afterwards. We then measured anti-spike trimeric IgG (Liaison XL, DiaSorin), anti-spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG (Access 2, Beckman Coulter) and anti-spike S1 subunit IgA (ELISA, Euroimmun). Results were presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). RESULTS: Vaccine administration elicited all anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies measured. Thirty days after the second vaccine dose, 100% positivization occurred for anti-spike trimeric IgG and anti-spike RBD IgG, whilst 1.7% subjects remained anti-spike S1 IgA negative. The overall increase of antibodies level ratio over baseline after the second vaccine dose was 576.1 (IQR, 360.7-867.8) for anti-spike trimeric IgG, 1426.0 (IQR, 742.0-2698.6) for anti-spike RBD IgG, and 20.2 (IQR, 12.5-32.1) for anti-spike S1 IgA. Significant inverse association was found between age and overall increase of anti-spike trimeric IgG (r=-0.24; p=0.001) and anti-spike S1 IgA (r=-0.16; p=0.028), but not with anti-spike RBD IgG (r=-0.05; p=0.497). CONCLUSIONS: mRNA COVID-19 vaccination elicits sustained serum levels of anti-spike trimeric IgG and anti-spike RBD IgG, while also modestly but significantly increasing those of anti-spike S1 IgA.","Salvagno, Gian Luca; Henry, Brandon M.; di Piazza, Giovanni; Pighi, Laura; de Nitto, Simone; Bragantini, Damiano; Gianfilippi, Gian Luca; Lippi, Giuseppe",J Med Biochem,669,14

There have been no studies on the types of ethical conflicts encountered most frequently and that are of most concern to clinicians in Spain. The aim of this study is to report the most common ethical conflicts faced by Spanish internists, as well as the importance that the practitioners attribute to each conflict. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our observational cross-sectional study employed a voluntary and anonymous survey aimed at Spanish medical internists and distributed through an ad hoc platform of the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine. RESULTS: The most common and relevant ethical issues for Spanish internists are related to patients’ end of life (decisions limiting therapeutic effort, use of palliative treatments, the establishment of do-not-resuscitate orders), the conflicts arising within the doctor-patient/family relationship, and making decisions with noncompetent patients. These results are similar to those of other English and European series. The ethical problems further complicate the healthcare activity of clinicians who more often notice these problems (50.3%) than those who do not notice them (16%). CONCLUSIONS: The most common and relevant ethical conflicts among Spanish internists are related to managing patients’ end of life, followed by those related to the doctor-patient relationship and the management of noncompetent patients. It is essential that training programs be designed to better address and recognise these problems.","Blanco Portillo, A.; García-Caballero, R.; Real de Asúa, D.; Herreros Ruíz-Valdepeñas, B.",Rev Clin Esp,669,1

As plastic-based PPE such as disposable face masks and gloves have become widely used, human exposure to PPE-derived pollutants may occur through indirect and direct pathways. This review explores the potential health impacts related to plastic-based PPE through these pathways. Face masks release microplastics, which are directly inhaled during use or transported through the environment. The latter can adsorb chemical contaminants and harbor pathogenic microbiota, and once consumed by organisms, they can translocate to multiple organs upon intake, potentially causing detrimental and cytotoxic effects.

The mobility restriction has disrupted all types of business; causing a devastating impact on countries' economies; and pushing millions of people into extreme poverty. Scientists have been assessing the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on various fronts but there is limited scholarship in the forestry sector. We navigated the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the forestry sector by taking Gandaki Province (21,974 km(2)) of Nepal as a case. Employing semi-structured interviews (n = 62) with all ten stakeholder groups, literature review and media analysis, our study revealed that the COVID-19 lockdown suspended all types of forestry and ecotourism businesses; obstructed research and monitoring activities; halted capacity development and extension services; impacted forest development work; and increased incidences of illegal logging and poaching and trafficking of wildlife. Because of the complete shutdown of businesses, the forestry sector of Gandaki province lost 9.6 million USD and 3.2 million man-days of employment during the lockdown period. The economic cost of the lockdown was 1.73 million USD for NTFPs traders, 1.26 million USD for ecotourism entrepreneurs, 0.55 million USD for the community forest user groups and 0.24 million USD for the smallholder or private forest owner. We suggested four post-COVID recovery pathways, including sustainable forest management, nature-based tourism, improvement of forest products value chain and community-based natural resource management to bounce back from the loss. As the current pandemic is most likely to derail the Sustainable Development Pathways of several countries, including Nepal and necessitates the need for an immediate response, the finding and recommendation of our study may inform decision-makers to reimage post-pandemic recovery and leverage sustainable development.","Laudari, Hari Krishna; Pariyar, Shiva; Maraseni, Tek",For Policy Econ,669,16

Samples were obtained from patients 60 years of age or above who were newly admitted to Sorlandet Hospital Arendal, Norway. The patients were interviewed for current symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. Using rayon swabs and nylon flocked swabs, comparable sets of mucosal samples were harvested from the nasopharynx and the oropharynx. The samples were analysed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. A total of 223 patients (mean age 74.9 years, standard deviation [SD] 9.0 years) were swabbed and a virus was recovered from 11% of the symptomatic patients. Regardless of the sampling site, a calculated 4.8 times higher viral load (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–17, p = 0.017) was obtained using the nylon flocked swabs as compared to the rayon swabs. Also, regardless of the type of swab, a calculated 19 times higher viral load was found in the samples from the nasopharynx as compared to the oropharynx (95% CI 5.4–67.4, p < 0.001). When swabbing for respiratory viruses in elderly patients, nasopharyngeal rather than oropharyngeal samples should be obtained.

Several dengue-endemic countries reported similar clinical and laboratory features between COVID-19 and dengue in the early incubation period, and thus discerning the infection is difficult. As a dengue-endemic country, Indonesia also poses the same challenge during the COVID-19 outbreak. This current study analyzed the IgG and IgM profiles from COVID-19 patients by using a serological SARS-CoV-2 and dengue rapid test. In addition, 38 sera from healthy individuals (pre-COVID-19 date) were analyzed using a dengue rapid test. Among 120 samples, 4 samples indicated dengue IgG positive. However, IgM, NS1, and RT-PCR analyses showed negative results. Interestingly, regarding seropositivity of NS1 and DENV IgG from healthy individuals (pre COVID-19 infection), two samples were positive DENV IgG, while one of them was positive NS1. This suggested that in the dengue-endemic area, many people have already experienced dengue and have immunity against dengue virus. There is also the possibility of antibody cross-reactivity between COVID-19 and dengue infection.

With the advent of coronavirus disease 2019 as a major health event, radiation oncologists in some situations need to alter the manner in which they act with individual patients. The well-being of health care workers and society as a whole needs to be considered in management decisions. During the time of a pandemic, ethics principles may be based more on a utilitarian approach that emphasizes the common good. Thus, at times treatment decisions might result in delays in initiating therapy, modifying the radiation treatment course (such as to a short course rather than a long course of therapy), and the sequence of therapies, all to minimize viral exposure. It is important that altered therapy is based as much as possible on institutional or departmental decisions and, to the extent possible, not on a case-by-case basis.

Community perceptions were elicited to present how the changes felt and how they affected aquatic food system and small-scale fisheries and found devastating impact. Sudden illness, reduced income, complication to start production and input collection, labor crisis, transportation abstraction, complexity in food supply, weak value chain, low consumer demand, rising commodity prices, creditor’s pressure were identified as the primary affecting drivers. Dependent people felt the measures taken by the Government should be based on protecting both the health and food security.

Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of the Otago exercise programme (OEP) on physical function and mental health among elderly with cognitive frailty during COVID‐19. BACKGROUND: Lockdowns and restrictions during the COVID‐19 pandemic result in longer‐term sedentary behaviours related disease and mental problem. Older people with cognitive frailty are more vulnerable to be influenced. Timely intervention may achieve better outcomes, OEP exercise was designed as a balance and muscle‐strengthening programme for elderly people. DESIGN: A parallel‐group, assessor‐blinded randomised controlled trial was performed according to CONSORT guidelines. METHODS: This study was conducted from July 2020 to October 2020 among 62 elderly people with cognitive frailty from a nursing home. Participants were randomly divided into an OEP group (n = 31) or a control group (n = 31). Both groups received sleep‐ and diet‐related health education. The OEP group also received a 12‐week group exercise programme. The Five Times Sit to Stand Test (FTSST), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT) were used to assess physical function. The Geriatric Depression Scale‐15 (GDS‐15) and the 12‐Item Short Form Health Survey Mental Component Summary (SF‐12 MCS) were used to assess mental health. Outcomes were measured at 6 and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Physical function and mental health were similar in the two groups at baseline. At 12 weeks, the OEP group (difference in change from baseline: FTSST, −2.78; TUGT, −3.73; BBS, 2.17; GDS‐15, −0.72; SF‐12 MCS, 2.58; all p < .001) exhibited significantly greater improvements than the control group (difference in change from baseline: FTSST, 1.55; TUGT, 1.66; BBS, −0.10; GDS‐15, 1.07; SF‐12 MCS, −5.95; all p < .001). CONCLUSION: Our findings showed the OEP group had better physical function and mental health outcomes than the control group. OEP can be used to improve the physical and mental function among elderly people with cognitive frailty during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

By using a computational methodology, we aimed to explain the molecular paths of COVID-19 associated neuropsychiatric symptoms, based on the mimicry of the human protein interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Methods: Available 11 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins’ structures have been extracted from Protein Data Bank. HMI-PRED (Host-Microbe Interaction PREDiction), a recently developed web server for structural PREDiction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between host and any microbial species, was used to find the “interface mimicry” through which the microbial proteins hijack host binding surfaces. Classification of the found interactions was conducted using the PANTHER Classification System. Results: Predicted Human-SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions have been extensively compared with the literature. Based on the analysis of the molecular functions, cellular localizations and pathways related to human proteins, SARS-CoV-2 proteins are found to possibly interact with human proteins linked to synaptic vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, axonal transport, neurotransmission, growth factors, mitochondrial and blood-brain barrier elements, in addition to its peripheral interactions with proteins linked to thrombosis, inflammation and metabolic control. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions may lead to the development of delirium, psychosis, seizures, encephalitis, stroke, sensory impairments, peripheral nerve diseases, and autoimmune disorders. Our findings are also supported by the previous in vivo and in vitro studies from other viruses. Further in vivo and in vitro studies using the proteins that are pointed here, could pave new targets both for avoiding and reversing neuropsychiatric presentations.","Yapici-Eser, Hale; Koroglu, Yunus Emre; Oztop-Cakmak, Ozgur; Keskin, Ozlem; Gursoy, Attila; Gursoy-Ozdemir, Yasemin",Front Hum Neurosci,669,1

The scores were 0 = no, 1 = a little bit, 2 = much, 3 = very much. Relatives were free to comment about these points. Sixteen of 25 screened family members were interviewed. Most family members had a good impression, providing scores of 2 or 3 for the first three items. However, the real presence bedside (forth question) was considered irreplaceable.

The physical and psychological complaints associated with obesity point to the importance of implementing effective interventions. Innovative mHealth applications appear to be promising in helping provide a continuous and flexible support during the intervention. Since research on mHealth interventions is still relatively sparse, the main goal of the current study is to assess the effectiveness of an mHealth obesity intervention in terms of weight reduction, health behaviours as well as health-related quality of life. In addition, the study aims to investigate various psychological explicit and implicit processes associated with physical activity behaviour. METHODS: The study includes quantitative and qualitative methods. Regarding the quantitative methods, the goal is to recruit up to 450 individuals at baseline in different obesity centres across Germany with some of these centres offering an mHealth intervention. All individuals who agree to take part in the mHealth intervention will be assigned to the intervention group, while all other individuals will be assigned to the control group. The mHealth obesity intervention consists of three stays at an obesity centre, with approximately six months between stays during which patients are supported by the digital platform CASPAR. The study includes three measurements with a baseline measurement and two follow-up measurements, one after six months and one after twelve months. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention, body weight, physical activity behaviour, eating behaviour as well as health related quality of life will be assessed. In addition, motivation, intentions, self-efficacy, enjoyment, and habit will be used to assess the psychological processes related with physical activity behaviour. A multivariate analysis of variance with repeated measurement and latent growth curve models will be used to compare the development of the variables within the two groups. In relation to the qualitative methods, interviews with individuals of the intervention group will be conducted to shed light on the applicability, acceptance, and usability of the mHealth intervention. DISCUSSION: This study may provide a valuable insight into the potential of mHealth obesity interventions and the psychological processes related to physical activity behaviour.

Also, the role of the over-activated immune system is noteworthy, leading to severe tissue injury via the cytokine storms. Thus it would be feasible to modulate the immune system response in order to attenuate the disease severity, as well as treating the patients. Today different medicines are being administered to the patients, but regardless of the efficacy of these treatments, adverse effects are pretty probable. Meanwhile, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) prove to be an effective candidate for treating the patients suffering from COVID-19 pneumonia, owing to their immunomodulatory and tissue-regenerative potentials.

RESULTS: A total of 57% of women were vitamin D deficient with higher vitamin D deficiency found among premenopausal women (64.7%) compared to postmenopausal women (49%). The median serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (IQR) were 16.7 ng/ml (IQR 9.8–30.0). Factors associated with vitamin D deficiency were lower socioeconomic status (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.15–3.48), younger age with highest vitamin D deficiency found in < 35 years of age group (OR 3.11; 95% CI 1.76–5.51), and winter season (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.07–2.15) after adjusting for multiple confounders. The use of vitamin D supplement (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38–0.92) and vigorous exercise (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05–0.80) were protective against vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, with detrimental health effects, among younger women belonging to lower socioeconomic status and during the winter season. The use of vitamin D supplements and vigorous exercise were protective measures. Public health campaigns are needed for education and awareness about vitamin D deficiency to improve vitamin D status for younger women living in poor environments.

Despite the need for more engagement with care, people who inject drugs (PWID) are hard to reach with HCV testing and treatment. We initiated a study to evaluate the efficacy for testing and linkage to care among PWID consulting peer-based testing at a mobile clinic in Copenhagen, Denmark. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this intervention study, we will recruit participants at a single community-based, peer-run mobile clinic. In a single visit, we will first offer participants a point-of-care HCV antibody test, and if they test positive, then they will receive an HCV RNA test. If they are HCV-RNA+, we will administer facilitated referrals to designated ‘fast-track’ clinics at a hospital or an addiction centre for treatment. The primary outcomes for this study are the number of tested and treated individuals. Secondary outcomes include individuals lost at each step in the care cascade. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The results of this study could provide a model for targeting PWID for HCV testing and treatment in Demark and other settings, which could help achieve WHO HCV elimination targets. The Health Research Ethics Committee of Denmark and the Danish Data Protection Agency confirmed (December 2018/January 2019) that this study did not require their approval.

Further issues remain to be clarified, including whether the genotype of rabbit HEV differs from human and swine HEV genotype 3 and whether rabbit HEV can infect human and other animals. HEV was found in farmed rabbits in several geographic areas of China, in USA and more recently in France. The prevalence of antibodies against HEV was 36%, 57% and 55% in rabbits from Virginia (USA), Gansu Province and Beijing (China), respectively. HEV RNA was detected in 16.5% of serum samples from farmed rabbits in Virginia, 7.5% in Gansu Province and 7.0% in Beijing. HEV RNA was detected in 7% of bile samples from farmed rabbits and in 23% of liver samples from wild rabbits in France. The full-length genomic sequences analysis indicates that all the rabbit strains belong to the same clade. Nucleotide sequences were 72.2–78.2% identical to HEV genotypes 1–4. Comparison with HEV sequences of human strains circulating in France and reference sequences identified a human strain closely related to rabbit HEV. A 93-nucleotide insertion in the X domain of the ORF1 of the human strain and in all the rabbit HEV strains was found. Moreover, the ability of rabbit HEV to cause cross-species infection in a pig model has recently been demonstrated. Rabbit HEV can replicate efficiently in human cell lines. Collectively, these data support the possibility of zoonotic transmission of HEV from rabbits.","Lhomme, Sébastien; Dubois, Martine; Abravanel, Florence; Top, Sokunthea; Bertagnoli, Stéphane; Guerin, Jean-Luc; Izopet, Jacques",J Clin Virol,669,26

Looking back at the year as a whole, she explores the impact of ongoing trauma on the therapeutic couple. She discusses the creative ways that clinicians have found to navigate the losses and differences between co‐present and distance treatment, including holding an internal paradox of immersion in telepresence and the maintenance of a reflective distance, to be shared and explored with the patient. She examines the effects that differing hardware such as telephone or computer screen have on our intimate communication, how the intrusion of the personal environments of both clinician and patient may have affected the dynamics of the therapeutic couple, and the personal and global experience of loss and bereavement for both therapist and patient, particularly when it has to be processed remotely. Finally, the BJP asks her to give her thoughts on the future and whether the ‘new normal’ will include more hybrid forms of training and treatment.","Isaacs Russell, Gillian",Br J Psychother,669,27

This study proposes a novel crowdsourcing model for the ride-sharing system where light vehicles such as scooters and bikes are crowdsourced. The proposed model is expected to solve the problem of charging and maintaining a large number of light vehicles where these efforts will be the responsibility of the crowd of suppliers. The proposed model consists of three entities: suppliers, customers, and a management party responsible for receiving, renting, booking, and demand matching with offered resources. It can allow suppliers to define the location of their private e-scooters/e-bikes and the period of time they are available for rent. Using a dataset of over 9 million e-scooter trips in Austin, Texas, we ran an agent-based simulation six times using three maximum battery ranges (i.e., 35, 45, and 60 km) and different numbers of e-scooters (e.g., 50 and 100) at each origin.

Although this has reversed some of the progress made in reducing the global burden of tuberculosis (TB) disease, there is an opportunity to incorporate lessons learned to improve TB programmes going forward. APPROACH: We use Pakistan as a case study to discuss three important adaptations in light of COVID-19: bringing care closer to patients; strengthening primary health care systems; and proactively addressing stigma and fear. FINDINGS: COVID-19 control in Pakistan has restricted people’s ability to travel and this has forced the TB programme to reduce the need for in-person health facility visits and bring care closer to patients’ homes. Strategies that may be useful for providing more convenient care to patients in the future include: : remote treatment support using telemedicine; collaborating with private healthcare providers; and establishing community medicine collection points. As part of the response to COVID-19 in Pakistan, the out-patient departments of major tertiary and secondary care hospitals were closed, and this highlighted the importance of strengthening primary healthcare for both better pandemic and TB control. Finally, stigma associated with COVID-19 and TB can be addressed using trusted community-based health workers, such as Lady Health Workers in Pakistan.","Fatima, Razia; Akhtar, Nasim; Yaqoob, Aashifa; D Harries, Anthony; S Khan, Mishal",Int J Infect Dis,669,16

Hasta la fecha, incluimos la conjuntivitis viral, una conjuntivitis inmunomediada y parálisis oculomotoras (POM). Se discute la posibilidad de retinopatía pero no se ha publicado ningún caso. La conjuntivitis viral puede aparecer aislada o asociada al cuadro sistémico, principalmente pulmonar, antes o después del inicio de los síntomas respiratorios. Puede ser tanto unilateral como bilateral, es típica la presencia de folículos, y presenta una duración variable entre 5 y 20 días. La conjuntivitis inmunomediada consiste en un enrojecimiento ocular acompañada de eritrodermia y febrícula. Aparece más frecuentemente en los niños y se ha asociado a un cuadro “Kawasaki-like” y síndrome del shock tóxico. Las POM pueden presentarse de forma aislada, o formando parte de un síndrome de Miller- Fisher, junto con ataxia e hiporreflexia.

Abstract In this review, a summary is presented of the main reports regarding the potential ocular manifestations of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Scientific evidence is based on letters to the editor, clinical cases and case series, cross-sectional, and a few longitudinal studies. To date, it includes viral conjunctivitis, immune conjunctivitis, and oculomotor palsies (OCP) due to the novel coronavirus. Retinopathy is discussed, but no cases have been published yet. A viral conjunctivitis outbreak can be isolated or associated with the systemic picture, mainly pulmonary, before or after the onset of respiratory symptoms. It can be both unilateral and bilateral, follicles are typical, and duration is variable between 5 and 21 days. Immune-mediated conjunctivitis consists of eye redness, together with erythroderma and fever. It appears more frequently in children, and has been associated with a ""Kawasaki-like"" disease and toxic shock syndrome. OCP can present on its own, or as part of Miller-Fisher syndrome, along with ataxia, and hyporeflexia.

The 13‐item CORC (COVID [or coronavirus] Rule‐out Criteria) rule had good overall diagnostic accuracy in retrospective derivation and validation. The objective of this study was to prospectively test the inter‐rater reliability and diagnostic accuracy of the CORC score and rule (score ≤ 0 negative, > 0 positive) and compare the CORC rule performance with physician gestalt. METHODS: This noninterventional study was conducted at an urban academic ED from February 2021 to March 2021. Two practitioners were approached by research coordinators and asked to independently complete a form capturing the CORC criteria for their shared patient and their gestalt binary prediction of the SARS‐CoV‐2 test result and confidence (0%–100%). The criterion standard for SARS‐CoV‐2 was from reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction performed on a nasopharyngeal swab. The primary analysis was from weighted Cohen's kappa and likelihood ratios (LRs). RESULTS: For 928 patients, agreement between observers was good for the total CORC score, κ = 0.613 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.579–0.646), and for the CORC rule, κ = 0.644 (95% CI = 0.591–0.697). The agreement for clinician gestalt binary determination of SARs‐CoV‐2 status was κ = 0.534 (95% CI = 0.437–0.632) with median confidence of 76% (first–third quartile = 66–88.5). For 425 patients who had the criterion standard, a negative CORC rule (both observers scored CORC < 0), the sensitivity was 88%, and specificity was 51%, with a negative LR (LR−) of 0.24 (95% CI = 0.10–0.50). Among patients with a mean CORC score of >4, the prevalence of a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 test was 58% (95% CI = 28%–85%) and positive LR was 13.1 (95% CI = 4.5–37.2). Clinician gestalt demonstrated a sensitivity of 51% and specificity of 86% with a LR− of 0.57 (95% CI = 0.39–0.74).

A cross-sectional study was carried out among students at Astana Medical University (N = 888, Kazakhstan) in March 2021. Only 2% of the participants were currently vaccinated, and 22.4% showed the potential for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The following barriers were the most important in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance: concern about possible side effects of vaccination (73%), absence of sufficient evidence on the effectiveness and safety (57%) and quality (42%), the belief that the immune system will cope with COVID-19 even without vaccination (38%), and lack of trust in the effectiveness of vaccination against COVID-19 (33%). Moreover, this study identified the following factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance: contextual influences (e.g., communication and media environment, socio-demographic factors, vaccination policies, and perception of the pharmaceutical industry), individual and group influences (e.g., personal experience with vaccination, attitudes about health and prevention, trust in the health system and providers, perceived risk), and specific issues on COVID-19 vaccine/vaccination (e.g., choice of vaccine can reduce vaccine hesitancy by 30%). A developed 12-item 6-factor model of COV-VHS showed good validity and reliability. In conclusion, there was a low-level potential for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among medical students in Kazakhstan.

However, no research analyzed the spatial dependency and temporal dynamics of 2019-nCoV. Consequently, this research aims to detect the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2019-nCoV epidemic using spatio-temporal analysis methods at the county level in Hubei province. The Mann–Kendall and Pettitt methods were used to identify the temporal trends and abrupt changes in the time series of daily new confirmed cases, respectively. The local Moran’s I index was applied to uncover the spatial patterns of the incidence rate, including spatial clusters and outliers. On the basis of the data from January 26 to February 11, 2020, we found that there were 11 areas with different types of temporal patterns of daily new confirmed cases. The pattern characterized by an increasing trend and abrupt change is mainly attributed to the improvement in the ability to diagnose the disease.

This change creates space for new narratives towards resilience. The resilience perspective implies preparing for shocks as well as various futures that might evolve. Thus, more sustainable food systems cannot only be built to be pandemic proof. This preparation can be facilitated by co-designing contrasting future narratives, identifying means for developing capacity to adapt to those futures and developing tools to enhance that capacity, such as demonstrated here. The capacity of food systems to adapt and transform is enhanced by dialogue, transparency and collective learning in food value chains and networks, sovereignty over resources, and built-in diversity in response to change. In market-led global food chains, supplier-buyer diversity is important, while in public-led regions with some market protection, farm and crop diversity might matter more in response to variability in weather, price and policies. During, for example, an international conflict, or the time of a pandemic, diverse food sourcing from local producer-consumer cooperatives to community-supported and urban agriculture could secure food for citizens. Assessments of critical diversity in response to shocks and volatility can help actors to tailor effective diversity to manage resilience while avoiding the long-feared trade-off between diversity and resource-use efficiency. The interdependence of humanity deserves attention, as food systems are only as resilient as their weakest actor. A truly resilient global food system implies not only preparedness for coming shocks and changes but also a foundation that makes shocks less probable and critical.","Kahiluoto, Helena",Food Secur,669,20

Drug repositioning has become a promising treatment strategy in COVID-19 crisis because it can shorten drug development process, reduce pharmaceutical costs and reposition approval drugs. Existing computational methods only focus on single information, such as drug and virus similarity or drug-virus network feature, which is not sufficient to predict potential drugs. In this paper, a sequence combined attentive network embedding model SANE is proposed for identifying drugs based on sequence features and network features. On the one hand, drug SMILES and virus sequence features are extracted by encoder–decoder in SANE as node initial embedding in drug-virus network. On the other hand, SANE obtains fields for each node by attention-based Depth-First-Search (DFS) to reduce noises and improve efficiency in representation learning and adopts a bottom-up aggregation strategy to learn node network representation from selected fields. Finally, a forward neural network is used for classifying. Experiment results show that SANE has achieved the performance with 81.98% accuracy and 0.8961 AUC value and outperformed state-of-the-art baselines. Further case study on COVID-19 indicates that SANE has a strong predictive ability since 25 of the top 40 (62.5%) drugs are verified by valuable dataset and literatures. Therefore, SANE is powerful to reposition drugs for COVID-19 and provides a new perspective for drug repositioning.","Su, Xiaorui; You, Zhuhong; Wang, Lei; Hu, Lun; Wong, Leon; Ji, Boya; Zhao, Bowei",Appl Soft Comput,669,16

Aiming at this problem, this paper incorporates psychological capital and social panic into the model from the perspective of the organizational safety climate and constructs a theoretical model of the mechanism of the effect on nursing staff’s willingness to stay in the context of the outbreak. Through a questionnaire survey in an aged care agency in Anhui Province, a total of 321 valid questionnaires were collected for empirical analysis. The results show that: (1) the safety climate of the organization has a significant positive impact on the transactional psychological capital and interpersonal psychological capital of nursing staff in the aged care industry and their willingness to stay; (2) transactional psychological capital and social panic have a significant positive impact on the willingness to stay of nursing staff, while interpersonal psychological capital has no significant impact on the willingness to stay; (3) the mediating role of transactional psychological capital and interpersonal psychological capital between the safety climate and the willingness to stay is established, and the moderating role of social panic between psychological capital and willingness to stay is also established.

Here, we investigate the glycosylation of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins from five different laboratories and compare them against S protein from infectious virus, cultured in Vero cells. We find patterns that are conserved across all samples, and this can be associated with site-specific stalling of glycan maturation that acts as a highly sensitive reporter of protein structure. Molecular dynamics simulations of a fully glycosylated spike support a model of steric restrictions that shape enzymatic processing of the glycans. These results suggest that recombinant spike-based SARS-CoV-2 immunogen glycosylation reproducibly recapitulates signatures of viral glycosylation.","Allen, Joel D.; Chawla, Himanshi; Samsudin, Firdaus; Zuzic, Lorena; Shivgan, Aishwary Tukaram; Watanabe, Yasunori; He, Wan-ting; Callaghan, Sean; Song, Ge; Yong, Peter; Brouwer, Philip J.

METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of individuals with persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19, collecting clinical data, pulmonary function tests, and plasma samples used for multiplex profiling of inflammatory, metabolic, angiogenic, and fibrotic factors. RESULTS: Sixty-one participants were enrolled across 2 academic medical centers at a median of 9 weeks (interquartile range, 6–10 weeks) after COVID-19 illness: n = 13 participants (21%) had mild COVID-19 and were not hospitalized, n = 30 participants (49%) were hospitalized but were considered noncritical, and n = 18 participants (30%) were hospitalized and in the intensive care unit (ICU). Fifty-three participants (85%) had lingering symptoms, most commonly dyspnea (69%) and cough (58%). Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) declined as COVID-19 severity increased (P < 0.05) but these values did not correlate with respiratory symptoms. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis of plasma biomarker profiles clustered participants by past COVID-19 severity. Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), MMP-7, and HGF identified by our analysis were significantly higher in the ICU group (P < 0.05), inversely correlated with FVC and DLCO (P < 0.05), and were confirmed in a separate validation cohort (n = 53). CONCLUSION: Subjective respiratory symptoms are common after acute COVID-19 illness but do not correlate with COVID-19 severity or pulmonary function.

Initial reports suggest that depression and anxiety are elevated during COVID-19, but no prior study has explored changes at the within-person level. The current study explored changes in depression and anxiety symptoms from before the pandemic to soon after it first peaked in Spring 2020 in a sample of adolescents and young adults (N = 451) living in Long Island, New York, an early epicenter of COVID-19 in the U.S. METHODS: Depression (Children's Depression Inventory) and anxiety symptoms (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Symptoms) were assessed between December 2014 and July 2019, and, along with COVID-19 experiences, symptoms were re-assessed between March 27th and May 15th, 2020. RESULTS: Across participants and independent of age, there were increased generalized anxiety and social anxiety symptoms. In females, there were also increased depression and panic/somatic symptoms. Multivariable linear regression indicated that greater COVID-19 school concerns were uniquely associated with increased depression symptoms. Greater COVID-19 home confinement concerns were uniquely associated with increased generalized anxiety symptoms, and decreased social anxiety symptoms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents and young adults at an early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. experienced increased depression and anxiety symptoms, particularly amongst females. School and home confinement concerns related to the pandemic were independently associated with changes in symptoms. Overall, this report suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is having multifarious adverse effects on the mental health of youth.","Hawes, Mariah T.; Szenczy, Aline K.; Klein, Daniel N.; Hajcak, Greg; Nelson, Brady D.",Psychological medicine,669,9

Repurposing of existing drugs indicated for other conditions seems to be the first choice for immediate therapeutic management. The quality of early evidence favoring the different treatment options needs to be apprised for informed decision-making. METHODS: In this systematic literature review, we apprised the quality of available evidence for different therapeutic options and also the basis for different treatment guidelines. To include all studies that are in different stages of publication, we also included studies from the preprint servers BioRxiv and MedRxiv and published studies from PubMed. RESULTS: We retrieved 5621 articles and included 22 studies for the systematic review. Based on our study, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, remdesivir, corticosteroids, convalescent sera, ritonavir/lopinavir, tocilizumab and arbidol were evaluated as therapeutic options. The data from different study designs reveal contradictory findings except for convalescent sera for which the evidence available is only from case series. Based on this early evidence, various national guidelines recommend remdesivir, convalescent sera, corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine in different subsets of patients. CONCLUSION: Establishing consensus with respect to the end points to be assessed for respiratory viruses may enhance the quality of evidence in case of future pandemics. The systematic review highlighted the lacuna and methodologic deficiency in early clinical evidence and included an update on different therapeutic management guidelines. Further clinical evidence from the ongoing trials may lead to evolution of treatment guidelines with the addition of more therapeutic options.","Subramanian, Kaushik; Nalli, Anuradha; Senthil, Vinitha; Jain, Saurabh; Nayak, Aravind; Bhat, Amit",Adv Ther,669,16

It is suggested that lymphopenia serves as a useful predictor for prognosis in the patients. It is also hypothesized that lymphopenia is related to glucocorticoids and apoptosis. However, the ordering between lymphopenia and apoptosis appears different between SARS and COVID‐19 patients, ie, lymphopenia is prior to apoptosis in SARS patients whereas apoptosis is prior to lymphopenia in COVID‐19 patients. This paper attempts to figure out this contradiction through three players, lymphopenia, glucocorticoids, and apoptosis. Although the literature does not provide a solid explanation, the level of glucocorticoids could determine the ordering between lymphopenia and apoptosis because the administration of high doses of glucocorticoids could lead to lymphopenia whereas low doses of glucocorticoids could benefit patients. In the meantime, this paper raises several questions, which need to be answered in order to better understand the whole course of COVID‐19.","Yan, Shaomin; Wu, Guang",FASEB J,669,20

Good surveillance systems should be coordinated, comprehensive, and adaptive. They should generate data in real time for immediate analysis and intervention, whether for endemic diseases or potential epidemics. Such systems are especially needed in low-resource settings where disease burden is the highest, but tracking systems are the weakest here due to competing priorities and constraints on available resources. In this article, using the examples of 3 large, and mostly successful, infectious disease surveillance studies in Bangladesh, we identify 2 core limitations—the pathogen bias and the vaccine bias—in the way current surveillance programs are designed for low-resource settings. We highlight the strengths of the current Global Invasive Bacterial Vaccine Preventable Disease Surveillance Network of the World Health Organization and present case studies from Bangladesh to illustrate how this surveillance platform can be leveraged to overcome its limitations. Finally, we propose a set of criteria for building a comprehensive infectious disease surveillance system with the hope of encouraging current systems to use the limited resources as optimally as possible to generate the maximum amount of knowledge.","Saha, Senjuti; Saha, Samir K",J Infect Dis,669,22

As a result, enormous efforts are necessary to restore and strengthen regulatory and enforcement regimes, and transcend deepened political cleavages on such matters.

Sedation, airway obstruction, and lung diseases impair respiration and gas exchange. The restitution of normal respiration takes place in the recovery room. Nonetheless, there is no evidence on the necessary observation time. We systematically reviewed current guidelines on bronchoscopy regarding sedation, monitoring and recovery. METHODS: This review was registered at the PROSPERO database (CRD42020197476). MEDLINE and awmf.org were double-searched for official guidelines, recommendation or consensus statements on bronchoscopy from 2010 to 2020. The PICO-process focussed on adults (Patients), bronchoscopy with maintained spontaneous breathing (Interventions), and recommendations regarding the intra- and postprocedural monitoring and sedation (O). The guideline quality was graded. A catalogue of 54 questions was answered. Strength of recommendation and evidence levels were recorded for each recommendation. RESULTS: Six guidelines on general bronchoscopy and three expert statements on special bronchoscopic procedures were identified. Four guidelines were evidence-based. Most guidelines recommend sedation to improve the patient’s tolerance. Midazolam combined with an opioid is preferred. The standard monitoring consists of non-invasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry, furthermore electrocardiogram in cardiac patients. Only one guideline discusses hypercapnia and capnometry, but without consensus. Two guidelines discuss a recovery time of two hours, but a recommendation was not given because of lack of evidence. CONCLUSION: Evidence for most issues is low to moderate. Lung-diseased patients are not represented by current guidelines. Capnometry and recovery time lack evidence.

However, little has been reported regarding the impact on blood utilization. We quantified the impact of COVID‐19 on blood utilization and discards among facilities reporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network Hemovigilance Module. METHODS: Facilities continuously reporting data, during January 2016–June 2020, on transfused and discarded blood components, stratified by component type (red blood cells [RBC], platelets and plasma), were included. Interrupted time‐series analysis with generalized estimating equations, adjusting for facility surgical volume and seasonality, was used to quantify changes in blood utilization and discards relative to a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services notification delaying non‐essential medical procedures (March 2020). RESULTS: Seventy‐two facilities included in the analyses, on average, transfused 44,548 and discarded 2202 blood components monthly. Following the March 2020 notification and after multivariable adjustment, RBC and platelet utilization declined, −14.8% (p < 0.001) and − 16.6% (p = 0.017) respectively. Discards increased for RBCs (49.0%, p = 0.013) and platelets (60.4%, p = 0.002). No statistically significant change in plasma was found. Following these abrupt changes, blood utilization and discards rebounded towards baseline with RBC use increasing by 5.7% (p < 0.001), and platelet and RBC discards decreasing −16.4% (<0.001) and − 12.7 (p = 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: Following notification delaying elective surgical procedures, blood utilization declined substantially while blood discards increased, resulting in substantial wastage of blood products. Ongoing and future pandemic response efforts should consider the impact of interventions on blood supply and demand to ensure blood availability. This article is protected by copyright.

The state-of-the-art on these constraints’ limits to a specific region, state, or a context; thus, the knowledge is scattered and not forming a global perspective on how and why communities’ engagement in urban development has been hindered. Having a sound understanding of the existing barriers and challenges to community inclusive decision-making process is paramount for finding solutions for transforming current practices towards equitable urban development. Accordingly, this comprehensive, structured literature review aims to consolidate literature of the current challenges and barriers to community-driven decision-making in urban development and of the potential solutions to overcome them. A structured literature review covering indexed publications from 2010 to 2020 was carried out to identify and classify barriers/challenges and solutions that exist at present. Following a systematic filtering process, a total of 63 out of 1324 research contributions have been considered for an in-depth analysis. The study found 48 barriers and challenges regarding the current context, available infrastructure for community engagement, and current decision-making processes. Of all, the lack of communities’ knowledge and awareness, absence of meaningful community engagement, and ill-defined aims and purpose of community engagement were identified as the topmost constraints. By synthesising the current research, the study found that these barriers can potentially be overcome through attitude transformation and capacity building of both community and professionals, investment in community engagement, and changes to present stakeholder engagement processes and policies.","Geekiyanage, Devindi; Fernando, Terrence; Keraminiyage, Kaushal",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,669,26

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 1003 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was conducted. Longitudinal liver function tests and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Abnormal liver function parameters were observed, both at admission (ALT 13.2%, AST 8.5%, ALP 2.0%, GGT 7.4%, LDH 37.6%, TBIL 4.0%, DBIL 7.8%, Albumin 10.1%) and peak hospitalization (ALT 29.4%, AST 17.5%, ALP 2.6%, GGT 13.4%, LDH 49.4%, TBIL 10.1%, DBIL 18.0%, Albumin 30.6%) in patients with COVID-19. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients had markedly higher liver function parameters from baseline to 30 days after hospital admission. Abnormal ALT and LDH at hospital admission and some medications use (Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and Traditional Chinese medicines) were associated with peak hospitalization ALT > 5× the upper limit unit of normal (ULN). On multivariate analysis, age >60 years, male, obesity, comorbidity, abnormal LDH and albumin at hospital admission and peak hospitalization were associated with progression to severe COVID-19 (OR > 1; p < 0.05). COX analysis revealed that ALT > 2 ULN (HR=7.0, p=0.011), AST > 2 ULN (HR=34.7, p < 0.001), and TBIL > 2 ULN (HR=54.6, p < 0.001) were associated with a higher mortality.

Nano-/microparticles and/or hydrogels can be now engineered to improve the administration and intra-articular delivery of specific drugs, targeting molecular pathways and pathogenic mechanisms involved in OA progression and remission. In order to summarize the current state of this field, a systematic review of the literature was performed and 45 relevant studies were identified involving both animal models and humans. We found that polymeric nanoparticles loaded with anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e., dexamethasone or celecoxib) are the most frequently investigated drug delivery systems, followed by microparticles and hydrogels. In particular, the nanosystem most frequently used in preclinical research consists of PLGA-nanoparticles loaded with corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Overall, improvement in histological features, reduction in joint inflammation, and improvement in clinical scores in patients were observed. The last advances in the field of nanotechnology could offer new opportunities to treat patients affected by knee OA, including those with previous meniscectomy. New smart drug delivery approaches, based on nanoparticles, microparticles, and hydrogels, may enhance the therapeutic potential of intra-articular agents by increasing the permanence of selected drugs inside the joint and better targeting specific receptors and tissues.","Gambaro, Francesco Manlio; Ummarino, Aldo; Torres Andón, Fernando; Ronzoni, Flavio; Di Matteo, Berardo; Kon, Elizaveta",Int J Mol Sci,669,33

Though most European countries have overcome the first epidemic wave, it remains of high priority to quantify the efficiency of different NPIs to inform preparedness for an impending second wave. In this study, combining capture-recapture methods with Bayesian inference in an age-structured mathematical model, we use a unique European dataset compiled by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) to quantify the efficiency of 24 NPIs and their combinations (referred to as public health responses, PHR) in reducing SARS-Cov-2 transmission rates in 32 European countries. Of 166 unique PHR tested, we found that median decrease in viral transmission was 74%, which is enough to suppress the epidemic. PHR efficiency was positively associated with the number of NPIs implemented. We found that bans on mass gatherings had the largest effect among NPIs, followed by school closures, teleworking, and stay home orders. Partial implementation of most NPIs resulted in lower than average response efficiency. This first large-scale estimation of NPI and PHR efficiency against SARS-COV-2 transmission in Europe suggests that a combination of NPIs targeting different population groups should be favored to control future epidemic waves.","Garchitorena, A.; Gruson, H.; Cazelles, B.; ROCHE, B.",,669,28

We utilize an Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) device to provide an effective method for mobile phone disinfection and survey HCPs about infection risk. METHODS: Environmental swabs were used to culture HCPs’ personal mobile phone surfaces. Four cultures were obtained per phone: before and after the UV-C device's 30-second disinfecting cycle, at the beginning and end of a 12-hour shift. Surveys were administered to participants pre- and post-study. RESULTS: Total bacterial colony forming units (CFUs) were reduced by 90.5% (p=0.006) after one UV-C disinfection cycle, and by 99.9% (p=0.004) after two cycles. Total pathogenic bacterial CFUs were decreased by 98.2% (p=0.038) after one and >99.99% (p=0.037) after two disinfection cycles. All survey respondents were willing to use the UV-C device daily to weekly, finding it convenient and beneficial. DISCUSSION: This novel UV-C disinfecting device is effective in reducing pathogenic bacteria on mobile phones. HCPs would frequently use a phone disinfecting device to reduce infection risk. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a standardized approach to phone disinfection may be valuable in preventing healthcare-associated infections.","Malhotra, Sanchi; Wlodarczyk, Jordan; Kuo, Christopher; Ngo, Catherine; Glucoft, Marisa; Sumulong, Ivan; Smit, Michael A.; Bender, Jeffrey M.",Am J Infect Control,669,24

We also quantify the impact of misclassification error bias on publicly reported case data in Maryland. Using a stratified random sampling approach, 50,000 individuals were selected from a simulated Maryland population to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19. We examined the situation when the true prevalence is low (0.07%-2%), medium (2%–5%) and high (6%–10%). Bayesian models informed by published validity estimates were used to account for misclassification error when estimating COVID-19 prevalence. Adjustment for misclassification error captured the true prevalence 100% of the time, irrespective of the true prevalence level. When adjustment for misclassification error was not done, the results highly varied depending on the population’s underlying true prevalence and the type of diagnostic test used. Generally, the prevalence estimates without adjustment for misclassification error worsened as the true prevalence level increased. Adjustment for misclassification error for publicly reported Maryland data led to a minimal but not significant increase in the estimated average daily cases. Random sampling and testing of COVID-19 are needed with adjustment for misclassification error to improve COVID-19 prevalence estimates.","Sahlu, Ida; Whittaker, Alexander B",Am J Epidemiol,669,3

Initial guidance advised that patients undergoing elective surgery isolate for 14 days prior to their operation. As we learnt more about COVID-19 and its incubation period, at the Princess Royal University Hospital this guidance has been decreased to 72 h. We collected retrospective data for two patient cohorts that underwent elective surgery in June and September 2020, isolating for 14 days and 72 h, respectively. We followed-up these patients with several questions allowing us to categorise the cohorts into three groups based on their compliance with isolation measures and also to assess their satisfaction with the isolation process. Our data shows that only 16% of the June cohort and 53% of the September cohort isolated in accordance with the guidelines whilst patient satisfaction was 16% and 64% respectively. These results highlight a suboptimal compliance to pre-operative guidelines as well as an adverse effect on patient mental health and raise the issue of both patient and NHS staff safety. With the possibility of a COVID-19 second wave and for future pandemics, a clear evidence-based plan for pre-operative isolation is vital.

Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed medical practice and severely disrupted the training of medical residents worldwide. The Spanish Society of Neurology conducted a study to assess its impact on the training of neurology residents in Spain. Methods We performed a descriptive, cross-sectional study through a survey distributed by e-mail to all neurology residents belonging to the Society. The survey included questions on demographic variables, care activity, and personal and educational impact of the pandemic, as well as respondents’ expectations for the future of their work in the post-pandemic era. Results Of 422 surveys sent, we received a total of 152 responses (36%); 79 respondents (52%) were women and 73 (48%) were men. By year of residency, 51 respondents (33.6%) were in the fourth year, 45 (29.6%) in the third year, 28 (18.4%) in the second year, and 28 (18.4%) in the first year.

The situation is considerably worse among millions of older (forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals or FDMNs) Rohingya adults, and the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may exacerbate the already existing precarious situation. The present study investigated depressive symptoms and their associated factors in older adult Rohingya FDMNs in Cox Bazar, Bangladesh, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A total of 416 older adults aged 60 years and above residing in Rohingya camps situated in the South Eastern part of Bangladesh were interviewed using a 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) in Bengali language. Chi-square test was performed to compare the prevalence of depressive symptoms within different categories of a variable and a binary logistic regression model was performed to determine the factors associated with depressive symptoms. RESULTS: More than 41% of Rohingya older adults had depressive symptoms (DS). Socio-demographic and economic factors such as living alone, dependency on family for living, poor memory, feelings of being left out, difficulty in getting medicine and routine medical care during COVID-19, perception that older adults are at highest risk of COVID-19 and pre-existing non-communicable chronic conditions were found to be significantly associated with developing DS. Higher DS was also evident among older female Rohingya FDMNs. CONCLUSION: DS are highly prevalent in older Rohingya FDMNs during COVID-19.

Although RNA synthesis and virus assembly occur in the cytoplasm, HRSV is known to induce nuclear responses in the host cell as replication alters global gene expression. Quantitative proteomics was used to take an unbiased overview of the protein changes in transformed human alveolar basal epithelial cells infected with HRSV. Underpinning this was the use of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS, which allowed the direct and simultaneous identification and quantification of both cellular and viral proteins. To reduce sample complexity and increase data return on potential protein localization, cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. This resulted in the identification of 1,140 cellular proteins and six viral proteins. The proteomics data were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to identify defined canonical pathways and functional groupings. Selected data were validated using Western blot, direct and indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, and functional assays. The study served to validate and expand upon known HRSV-host cell interactions, including those associated with the antiviral response and alterations in subnuclear structures such as the nucleolus and ND10 (promyelocytic leukemia bodies). In addition, novel changes were observed in mitochondrial proteins and functions, cell cycle regulatory molecules, nuclear pore complex proteins and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking proteins. These data shed light into how the cell is potentially altered to create conditions more favorable for infection. Additionally, the study highlights the application and advantage of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS for the analysis of virus-host interactions.","Munday, Diane C.; Emmott, Edward; Surtees, Rebecca; Lardeau, Charles-Hugues; Wu, Weining; Duprex, W.

DESIGN: We performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of quarantine strategies when one or more SARS-CoV-2 tests were administered during the quarantine. Simulations were based on statistical models for the transmissibility and viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the sensitivities of available testing methods. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of perturbations in model assumptions on the outcomes of optimal strategies. RESULTS: We found that SARS-CoV-2 testing can effectively reduce the length of a quarantine without compromising safety. A single reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) test performed before the end of quarantine can reduce quarantine duration to 10 days. Two tests can reduce the duration to 8 days, and three highly sensitive RT-PCR tests can justify a 6-day quarantine. More strategic testing schedules and longer quarantines are needed if tests are administered with less-sensitive RT-PCR tests or antigen tests. Shorter quarantines can be used for applications that tolerate a residual postquarantine transmission risk comparable to a 10-day quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: Testing could substantially reduce the length of isolation, reducing the physical and mental stress caused by lengthy quarantines. With increasing capacity and lowered costs of SARS-CoV-2 tests, test-assisted quarantines could be safer and more cost-effective than 14-day quarantines and warrant more widespread use.","Peng, Bo; Zhou, Wen; Pettit, Rowland W; Yu, Patrick; Matos, Peter G; Greninger, Alexander L; McCashin, Julie; Amos, Christopher I",BMJ Open,669,20

Notwithstanding a number of successful case studies, previous works have shown that using different mobility data sources, such as mobile phone data or census surveys, to parametrize infectious disease models can generate divergent outcomes. Thus, it remains unclear to what extent epidemic modelling results may vary when using different proxies for human movements. Here, we systematically compare 658 000 simulated outbreaks generated with a spatially structured epidemic model based on two different human mobility networks: a commuting network of France extracted from mobile phone data and another extracted from a census survey. We compare epidemic patterns originating from all the 329 possible outbreak seed locations and identify the structural network properties of the seeding nodes that best predict spatial and temporal epidemic patterns to be alike. We find that similarity of simulated epidemics is significantly correlated to connectivity, traffic and population size of the seeding nodes, suggesting that the adequacy of mobile phone data for infectious disease models becomes higher when epidemics spread between highly connected and heavily populated locations, such as large urban areas.","Panigutti, Cecilia; Tizzoni, Michele; Bajardi, Paolo; Smoreda, Zbigniew; Colizza, Vittoria",R Soc Open Sci,669,1

Shortages of surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirators has led to the extended use or re-use of single-use respirators and surgical masks by frontline healthcare workers. The evidence base underpinning such practices has been questioned. Objectives To summarise guidance and synthesise systematic review evidence on extended use, re-use or reprocessing of single-use surgical masks or filtering facepiece respirators. Methods A targeted search of the World Health Organization, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Public Health England websites was conducted to identify guidance. Four databases (Medline, Pubmed, Epistemonikos, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) and three preprint repositories (Litcovid, MedRxiv and Open Science Framework) were searched for relevant systematic reviews. Record screening and data extraction was conducted by two reviewers. Quality of included systematic reviews was appraised using the AMSTAR-2 checklist. Findings were integrated and narratively synthesised to highlight the extent to which key claims in guidance documents were supported by research evidence. Results Six guidance documents were identified. All note that extended use or re-use of single-use surgical masks and respirators (with or without reprocessing) should be considered only in situations of critical shortage. Extended use was generally favoured over re-use because of reduced risk of contact transmission. Four high-quality systematic reviews were included: three focused on reprocessing (decontamination) of N95 respirators and one focused on reprocessing of surgical masks. There was limited evidence on the impact of extended use on masks and respirators. Vaporised hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation were highlighted as the most promising reprocessing methods, but evidence on the relative efficacy and safety of different methods was limited. We found no well-established methods for reprocessing respirators at scale. Conclusions: There is limited evidence on the impact of extended use and re-use of surgical masks and respirators. Where extended use or re-use is being practiced, healthcare organisations should ensure that policies and systems are in place to ensure these practices are carried out safely and in line with available guidance.","Toomey, Elaine; Conway, Yvonne; Burton, Christopher; Smith, Simon; Smalle, Michael; Chan, Xin-Hui; Adisesh, Anil; Tanveer, Sarah; Ross, Lawrence; Thomson, Iain; Devane, Declan; Greenhalgh, Trish",,669,0

This article highlights four key considerations that scholars of wellness should consider when exploring the impact of the LE or designing interventions to modify the environment. These include 1) a thoughtful definition and theoretical conceptualization of the LE, 2) clarity about the study variables that are essential to the study question(s), 3) thoughtful and appropriate measurement of those variables, and 4) a study design that balances quality with feasibility. We provide a practical illustration of how these considerations can be applied in studies exploring the intersection of wellness and the LE.","Gruppen, Larry D; Fogarasi, Miklos C",Glob Adv Health Med,669,16

The further prevalence of the disease can be prevented by correct management of society and increasing knowledge, practices, and attitudes of the people. The present research aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and preventive behaviors of people in Hormozgan in the south of Iran toward COVID-19. SUBJECT AND METHODS: The present cross-sectional research was conducted over 2 months (March 2020–April 2020). The online questionnaire comprised four sections: demographic information, knowledge, attitude, and behavior toward COVID-19. Knowledge included 36 items, attitude eight items, and behavior ten items. The collected data were analyzed statistically using SPSS ver. 22. The split-half method was used to test the reliability of knowledge and the estimated value was 0.84. That of attitude and behavior was estimated via Cronbach’s alpha and was found to be 0.81 and 0.75, respectively. RESULTS: A total number of 2024 participants with an average age of 33.94 years took part in this research. Of all participants, 64.4% were female. According to the results, 65.8% enjoyed a good level of knowledge and 34.2% enjoyed an average level. In addition, 63.2% demonstrated a good attitude and 36.8% an average level. A large percentage of participants (90.6%) had good practices and only 9.4% had an average level of practices. CONCLUSION: The present findings show that participants had a relatively good level of knowledge, positive attitude, and good behavior concerning COVID-19.","Shahabi, Nahid; Kamalzadeh Takhti, Hesamaddin; Hassani Azad, Mehdi; Ezati Rad, Roghayeh; Ghaffari, Hamid Reza; Mohseni, Shokrollah; Aghamolaei, Teamur; Norozian, Fatemeh",Z Gesundh Wiss,669,27

This conundrum occurs because common air samplers can inactivate virions through their harsh collection processes. We sought to resolve the question whether viable SARS-CoV-2 can occur in aerosols using VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water-vapor condensation principle. METHODS: Air samples collected in the hospital room of two COVID-19 patients, one ready for discharge, the other newly admitted, were subjected to RT-qPCR and virus culture. The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 collected from the air and isolated in cell culture were sequenced. RESULTS: Viable SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from air samples collected 2 to 4.8 m away from the patients. The genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from the material collected by the air samplers was identical to that isolated from the newly admitted patient. Estimates of viable viral concentrations ranged from 6 to 74 TCID(50) units/L of air. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 produce aerosols in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures that contain viable SARS-CoV-2, and these aerosols may serve as a source of transmission of the virus.","Lednicky, John A.; Lauzardo, Michael; Hugh Fan, Z.; Jutla, Antarpreet; Tilly, Trevor B.; Gangwar, Mayank; Usmani, Moiz; Shankar, Sripriya Nannu; Mohamed, Karim; Eiguren-Fernandez, Arantza; Stephenson, Caroline J.; Alam, Md.

While pneumococcal infection remains the predominant cause of bacterial pneumonia, the review highlights the importance of other co‐ and secondary bacterial and viral infections associated with influenza, and the emergence of newly identified dual infections associated with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain. Severe influenza‐associated pneumonia is often bacterial and will necessitate antibiotic treatment. In addition to the well‐known bacterial causes, less common bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila may also be associated with influenza when new influenza strains emerge.

Existing quarantine policies led to large-scale lock-downs because of the slow tracking of the infection paths, and indeed we see new waves of the disease. This can be solved by contact tracing combined with efficient testing policies. Since the number of daily tests is limited, it is crucial to exploit them efficiently to improve the outcome of contact tracing (technological or human-based epidemiological investigations). We develop a controlled testing framework to achieve this goal. The key is to test individuals with high probability of being infected to identify them before symptoms appear. These probabilities are updated based on contact tracing and test results. We demonstrate that the proposed method could reduce the quarantine and morbidity rates compared to existing methods by up to a 50%. The results clearly demonstrate the necessity of accelerating the epidemiological investigations by using technological contact tracing. Furthermore, proper use of the testing capacity using the proposed controlled testing methodology leads to significantly improved results under both small and large testing capacities. We also show that for small new outbreaks controlled testing can prevent the large spread of new waves.

Surfaces and objects contaminated by saliva or nose secretions represent a risk for indirect transmission of COVID-19. We assayed surfaces from hospital and living spaces to identify the presence of viral RNA and the spread of fomites in the environment. Anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids was monitored by detecting the microbiota signature using multiplex RT-PCR on selected species and massive sequencing on 16S-amplicons. A total of 92 samples (flocked swab) were collected from critical areas during the pandemic, including indoor (3 hospitals and 3 public buildings) and outdoor surfaces exposed to anthropic contamination (handles and handrails, playgrounds). Traces of biological fluids were frequently detected in spaces open to the public and on objects that are touched with the hands (>80%). However, viral RNA was not detected in hospital wards or other indoor and outdoor surfaces either in the air system of a COVID-hospital, but only in the surroundings of an infected patient, in consistent association with droplets traces and fomites. Handled objects accumulated the highest level of multiple contaminations by saliva, nose secretions and faecal traces, further supporting the priority role of handwashing in prevention. In conclusion, anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids is widespread in spaces open to the public and can be traced by RT-PCR.

The patients may be asymptomatic and clinical symptoms represent a wide range of neurologic manifestations and nonspecific neuropsychiatric disorders. We report an unusual case of Fahr’s syndrome which was asymptomatic and incidentally diagnosed by generalized tonic-clonic seizure in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 (COVİD-19) pneumonia.

There is a dearth of knowledge on developing evidence-based interventions that address comorbid NCDs using a task-shifting approach. The Friendship Bench, a brief psychological intervention for common mental disorders delivered by trained community grandmothers, is a promising intervention for comorbid NCDs. Although task-shifting appears to be a rational approach, evidence suggests that it may bring about tension between existing professionals from whom tasks are shifted. A Theory of Change approach is an effective way of managing the unintended tension by bringing together different stakeholders involved to build consensus on how to task shift appropriately to the parties involved. We aimed to use a theory of change approach to formulating a road map on how to successfully integrate diabetes and hypertension care into the existing Friendship Bench in order to come up with an integrated care package for depression, hypertension and diabetes aimed at strengthening NCD care in primary health care systems in Zimbabwe. METHOD: A theory of change workshop with 18 stakeholders from diverse backgrounds was carried out in February 2020. Participants included grandmothers working on the Friendship Bench project (n = 4), policymakers from the ministry of health (n = 2), people with lived experience for the three NCDs (n = 4), health care workers (n = 2), and traditional healers (n = 2). Findings from earlier work (situational analysis, desk review, FGDs and clinic-based surveys) on the three NCDs were shared before starting the ToC. A facilitator with previous experience running ToCs led the workshop and facilitated the co-production of the ToC map. Through an iterative process, consensus between the 18 stakeholders was reached, and a causal pathway leading to developing a framework for an intervention was formulated. RESULTS: The ToC singled out the need to use expert clients (people with lived experience) to promote a patient-centred care approach that would leverage the existing Friendship Bench approach. In the face of COVID-19, the stakeholders further endorsed the use of existing digital platforms, notably WhatsApp, as an alternative way to reach out to clients and provide support. Leveraging existing community support groups as an entry point for people in need of NCD care was highlighted as a win-win by all stakeholders. A final framework for an NCD care package supported by Friendship Bench was presented to policymakers and accepted to be piloted in five geographical areas. CONCLUSIONS: The ToC can be used to build consensus on how best to use using an existing intervention for common mental disorders to integrate care for diabetes and hypertension. There is a need to evaluate this new intervention through an adequately powered study.

Drug binding to HSA is an important consideration when developing new therapeutic molecules, and it also aids in understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern their pharmacological effects. This study aims to investigate the molecular binding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapeutic candidate molecules to HSA and to identify their putative binding sites. Binding energies and interacting residues were used to evaluate the molecular interaction. Four drug candidate molecules (β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine, Chloroquine, Disulfiram, and Carmofur) demonstrate weak binding to HSA, with binding energies ranging from -5 to -6.7 kcal/mol. Ivermectin, Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Arbidol, and other twenty drug molecules with binding energies ranging from -6.9 to -9.5 kcal/mol demonstrated moderate binding to HSA. The strong HSA binding drug candidates consist of fourteen molecules (Saquinavir, Ritonavir, Dihydroergotamine, Daclatasvir, Paritaprevir etc.) with binding energies ranging from -9.7 to -12.1 kcal/mol. All these molecules bind to different HSA subdomains (IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, and IIIB) through molecular forces such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Various pharmacokinetic properties (gastrointestinal absorption, blood-brain barrier permeation, P-glycoprotein substrate, and cytochrome P450 inhibitor) of each molecule were determined using SwissADME program. Further, the stability of the HSA-ligand complexes was analyzed through 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations considering various geometric properties. The binding free energy between free HSA and compounds were calculated using Molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) approach.The findings of this study might be useful in understanding the mechanism of COVID-19 drug candidates binding to serum albumin protein, as well as their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.","Bahadur Gurung, Arun; Ajmal Ali, Mohammad; Lee, Joongku; Abul Farah, Mohammad; Mashay Al-Anazi, Khalid; Sami, Hiba",Saudi J Biol Sci,669,26

The disease has claimed many fatalities as it has transcended from one country to another since it was first discovered in China in late 2019. To prevent further morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, most of the countries initiated a countrywide lockdown. While physical distancing and lockdowns helped in curbing the spread of this novel coronavirus, it led to massive economic losses for the nations. Positive impacts have been observed due to lockdown in terms of improved air quality of the nations. In the current research, ten tropical and subtropical countries have been analysed from multiple angles, including air pollution, assessment and valuation of health impacts and economic loss of countries during COVID-19 lockdown. Countries include Brazil, India, Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Validated Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) binning model is used on data collated from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) for particulate matters with a diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM(2.5)) for all the countries for the month of January to May 2019 and 2020. The concentration results of PM(2.5) show that air pollution has drastically reduced in 2020 post lockdown for all countries. The highest average concentration obtained by converting aerosol optical depth (AOD) for 2020 is observed for Thailand as 121.9 μg/m(3) and the lowest for Mexico as 36.27 μg/m(3). As air pollution is found to decrease in the April and May months of 2020 for nearly all countries, they are compared with respective previous year values for the same duration to calculate the reduced health burden due to lockdown.

Findings suggest a number of critical research and evidence gaps, including the need for reviews on occupational groups potentially exposed to or impacted by the negative work and health effects of COVID-19 in addition to health care workers, the long-term consequences of transitioning to the post-COVID-19 economy on work and health, and research with an equity or social determinants of health lens.","Fan, Jonathan; Senthanar, Sonja; Macpherson, Robert A.; Sharpe, Kimberly; Peters, Cheryl E.; Koehoorn, Mieke; McLeod, Christopher B.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,669,20

Based on individual records of 1178 potential SARS-CoV-2 infectors and their 15,648 contacts in Hunan, China, we estimated key transmission parameters. The mean generation time was estimated to be 5.7 (median: 5.5, IQR: 4.5, 6.8) days, with infectiousness peaking 1.8 days before symptom onset, with 95% of transmission events occurring between 8.8 days before and 9.5 days after symptom onset. Most transmission events occurred during the pre-symptomatic phase (59.2%). SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to infection increases with age, while transmissibility is not significantly different between age groups and between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Contacts in households and exposure to first-generation cases are associated with higher odds of transmission. Our findings support the hypothesis that children can effectively transmit SARS-CoV-2 and highlight how pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission can hinder control efforts.","Hu, Shixiong; Wang, Wei; Wang, Yan; Litvinova, Maria; Luo, Kaiwei; Ren, Lingshuang; Sun, Qianlai; Chen, Xinghui; Zeng, Ge; Li, Jing; Liang, Lu; Deng, Zhihong; Zheng, Wen; Li, Mei; Yang, Hao; Guo, Jinxin; Wang, Kai; Chen, Xinhua; Liu, Ziyan; Yan, Han; Shi, Huilin; Chen, Zhiyuan; Zhou, Yonghong; Sun, Kaiyuan; Vespignani, Alessandro; Viboud, Cécile; Gao, Lidong; Ajelli, Marco; Yu, Hongjie",Nat Commun,669,20

We hypothesize that high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation will reduce risk of hospitalization/death among those with recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection and will reduce risk of COVID-19 infection among their close household contacts. Methods We report the rationale and design of a planned pragmatic, cluster randomized, double-blinded trial (N = 2700 in total nationwide), with 1500 newly diagnosed individuals with COVID-19 infection, together with up to one close household contact each (~1200 contacts), randomized to either vitamin D3 (loading dose, then 3200 IU/day) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio and a household cluster design. The study duration is 4 weeks. The primary outcome for newly diagnosed individuals is the occurrence of hospitalization and/or mortality. Key secondary outcomes include symptom severity scores among cases and changes in the infection (seroconversion) status for their close household contacts. Changes in vitamin D 25(OH)D levels will be assessed and their relation to study outcomes will be explored. Conclusions The proposed pragmatic trial will allow parallel testing of vitamin D3 supplementation for early treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. The household cluster design provides a cost-efficient approach to testing an intervention for reducing rates of hospitalization and/or mortality in newly diagnosed cases and preventing infection among their close household contacts.","Wang, Rui; DeGruttola, Victor; Lei, Quanhong; Mayer, Kenneth H.; Redline, Susan; Hazra, Aditi; Mora, Samia; Willett, Walter C.; Ganmaa, Davaasambuu; Manson, JoAnn E.",Contemp Clin Trials,669,22

Blood samples (309) were randomly collected from pigs at farms throughout T&T. Serum samples were tested for the presence of antibodies to the aforementioned viruses using commercial ELISA kits, and the circulating strains of SwIV were identified by the hemagglutination inhibition test (HIT). Antibodies against SwIV were detected in 114 out of the 309 samples (37%). Out of a total of 26 farms, 14 tested positive for SwIV antibodies. HI testing revealed high titers against the A/sw/Minnesota/593/99 H3N2 strain and the pH1N1 2009 pandemic strain. Antibodies against PPV were detected in 87 out of the 309 samples (28%), with 11 out of 26 farms testing positive for PPV antibodies.

In children without DS, SARS-CoV-2 can rarely cause severe COVID-19 pneumonia, or an even rarer and more typically pediatric condition, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Although the underlying mechanisms are still unknown, MIS-C is thought to be primarily immune-mediated. Here, we describe an atypical, severe form of MIS-C in two infant girls with DS who were hospitalized for over 4 months. Immunological evaluation revealed pronounced neutrophilia, B cell depletion, increased circulating IL-6 and IL-8, and elevated markers of immune activation ICAM1 and FcɣRI. Importantly, uninfected children with DS presented with similar but less stark immune features at steady state, possibly explaining risk of further uncontrolled inflammation following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Peripheral blood smear (PBS) is a simple and available method to investigate blood cells’ morphologic changes. In this study, we aimed to determine the morphologic changes and abnormalities of COVID-19 patients and their relation to the patients’ clinical course. In this prospective cross-sectional study, we included 89 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients. A pathologist examined the PBS findings of these patients. The patients’ clinical course, including severity, outcome, intubation, and ICU admission, was extracted from their profiles. The statistical analyses were done to find out the relation between PBS findings and patients’ clinical course. Results showed that smudge cells are the most frequent abnormality in our participants. Other findings were schistocyte; atypical lymphocytes; and increased large granular lymphocytes, shift to left of granulocytes, giant platelets, and leukoerythroblastic reaction. Our results did not show any statistically significant relationship between PBS findings and their clinical course.

The hybrid protein carrying the wild-type repressor domain is mostly secreted to the cell surface, whereas hybrid proteins with amino acid substitutions that cause the repressor domain to be thermodynamically unstable are retained intracellularly. Surprisingly, the retained hybrids are found in the vacuole, where the repressor moiety is degraded by vacuolar proteases. The following observations indicate that receptor-mediated recognition of the mutant repressor domain in the Golgi lumen targets these hybrid fusions to the vacuole. (a) The invertase-repressor fusions, like wild-type invertase, behave as soluble proteins in the ER lumen. (b) Targeting to the vacuole is saturable since overexpression of the hybrids carrying mutant repressor increases the fraction of fusion protein that appears at the cell surface. (c) Finally, deletion of the VPS10 gene, which encodes the transmembrane Golgi receptor responsible for targeting carboxypeptidase Y to the vacuole, causes the mutant hybrids to be diverted to the cell surface. Together these findings suggest that yeast have a salvage pathway for degradation of nonnative luminal proteins by receptor- mediated transport to the vacuole.",,J Cell Biol,669,5

To date, few data on immunologic features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. Methods In this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Tongji hospital were included from Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020. The immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases. Results Of the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million/L) than moderate cases (11000 million/L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U/L, 567.2 U/L, 135.2 mg/L and 1734.4 ug/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U/L, 234.4 U/L, 51.4 mg/L and 880.2 ug /L). IL-2R, TNF-α and IL-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg/mL, 10.9 pg/mL and 10.9 pg/mL) than moderate cases (441.7 pg/mL, 7.5 pg/mL and 6.6 pg/mL). Absolute number of total T lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million/L) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million/L). The expressions of IFN-γ by CD4+T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%). Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+T cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN-γ production, which may be associated with disease severity. Together with clinical characteristics, early immunologic indicators including diminished T lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may serve as potential markers for prognosis in COVID-19.","Chen, Guang; Wu, Di; Guo, Wei; Cao, Yong; Huang, Da; Wang, Hongwu; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Xiaoyun; Chen, Huilong; Yu, Haijing; Zhang, Xiaoping; Zhang, Minxia; Wu, Shiji; Song, Jianxin; Chen, Tao; Han, Meifang; Li, Shusheng; Luo, Xiaoping; Zhao, Jianping; Ning, Qin",,669,16

However, few studies have explored research recruitment and retention challenges in the context of personality disorders. AIM: To provide an analysis of the factors affecting participant recruitment and retention in a study of borderline personality disorder among general psychiatric inpatients. METHODS: Adult inpatients in a tertiary psychiatric hospital were approached about participating in a cross-sectional study of borderline personality disorder. Recruitment rates, retention rates, and reasons for declining participation or withdrawing from the study were collected. Demographic characteristics were compared between participants and non-participants and between patients who remained in the study and those who withdrew. RESULTS: A total of 71 participants were recruited into the study between January 2018 and March 2020. Recruitment and retention rates were 45% and 70%, respectively. Lack of interest was the most commonly cited reason for non-participation, followed by scheduling conflicts and concerns regarding mental/physical well-being.

However, suspect interviews in child sexual abuse (CSA) investigations is an understudied research area. In the present mixed-methods study, we examine Swedish (n = 126) and Norwegian (n = 52) police interviewers' self-reported goals, tactics, and emotional experiences when conducting interviews with suspected CSA offenders. The quantitative analyses found associations between the interviewers' self-reported goals, tactics, and emotions during these types of suspect interviews. Interviewers who reported experiencing more negative emotions were more likely to employ confrontational tactics. Specifically, anger was positively associated with the goal of obtaining a confession and with aggressive tactics like raising one's voice and emphasizing the seriousness of the crime. Frustration and disgust displayed similar patterns. Somewhat contrasting these quantitative results, the thematic analysis identified a strong consensus that emotions should not and do not affect the police interviewers' work. Furthermore, the police interviewers described a range of strategies for managing emotions during the interview and for processing their emotional reactions afterwards. The present findings highlight the relevance of emotional processes in CSA suspect interviews and provide an initial exploration of the potentially complex relationship between the goals, tactics, and emotional experiences of police interviewers who question CSA suspects.","Magnusson, Mikaela; Joleby, Malin; Luke, Timothy J.; Ask, Karl; Lefsaker Sakrisvold, Marthe",Front Psychol,669,30

Consumers ability to search, find, appraise and use health information from the internet is known as eHealth literacy skill. eHealth literacy is a congregate set of six basic skills (traditional literacy, health literacy, information literacy, scientific literacy, media literacy and computer literacy). The aim of this study was to assess eHealth literacy level and associated factors among internet user chronic patients in North-west Ethiopia. METHODS: Institutional based cross-sectional study design was conducted. Stratified sampling technique was used to select 423 study participants among chronic patients. The eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) was used for data collection. The eHEALS is a validated eight-item Likert scaled questionnaire used to asses self-reported capability of eHealth consumers to find, appraise, and use health related information from the internet to solve health problems. Statistical Package for Social science version 20 was used for data entry and further analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between the eHealth literacy skill and associated factors. Significance was obtained at 95% CI and p < 0.05. RESULT: In total, 423 study subjects were approached and included in the study from February to May, 2019. The response rate to the survey was 95.3%. The majority of respondents 268 (66.3%) were males and mean age was 35.58 ± 14.8 years. The multivariable logistic regression model indicated that participants with higher education (at least having the diploma) are more likely to possess high eHealth literacy skill with Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 3.48, 95% CI (1.54, 7.87). similarly, being government employee AOR: 1.71, 95% CI (1.11, 2.68), being urban resident AOR: 1.37, 95% CI (0.54, 3.49), perceived good health status AOR: 3.97, 95% CI (1.38, 11.38), having higher income AOR: 4.44, 95% CI (1.32, 14.86), Daily internet use AOR: 2.96, 95% CI (1.08, 6.76), having good knowledge about the availability and importance of online resources AOR: 3.12, 95% CI (1.61, 5.3), having positive attitude toward online resources AOR: 2.94, 95% CI (1.07, 3.52) and higher level of computer literacy AOR: 3.81, 95% CI (2.19, 6.61) were the predictors positively associated with higher eHealth literacy level. CONCLUSION: Besides the mounting indication of efficacy, the present data confirm that internet use and eHealth literacy level of chronic patients in this setting is relatively low which clearly implicate that there is a need to fill the skill gap in eHealth literacy among chronic patients which might help them in finding and evaluating relevant online sources for their health-related decisions.","Shiferaw, Kirubel Biruk; Tilahun, Binyam Chakilu; Endehabtu, Berhanu Fikadie; Gullslett, Monika Knudsen; Mengiste, Shegaw Anagaw",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,669,33

In this study, we constructed a recombinant baculovirus (S-Bac) expressing full-length spike protein of the virulent epidemic genotype 2b (G2b) PEDV strain for serological studies of infected pigs. We found that most spike-specific antibodies produced upon PEDV infection in pigs are conformation-specific and they could be detected on S-Bac-infected insect cells by immunofluorescent assay, but they were insensitive to Western blot analysis, the typical method for antiserum analysis. These results indicated that spike conformation is crucial for serum recognition. Since it is difficult to purify trimeric spike membrane protein for conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we used S-Bac to generate a novel cell-based ELISA for convenient PEDV detection. We analyzed 100 pig serum samples, and our cell-based ELISA exhibited a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 97%, and almost perfect agreement [Cohen’s kappa coefficient value (κ) = 0.98] with immunocytochemical staining results. Our cell-based ELISA rapidly presented antigen for proper detection of conformation-specific antibodies, making PEDV detection more convenient, and it will be useful for detecting many viral diseases in the future.","Hsu, Wei-Ting; Chang, Chia-Yu; Tsai, Chih-Hsuan; Wei, Sung-Chan; Lo, Huei-Ru; Lamis, Robert John S.; Chang, Hui-Wen; Chao, Yu-Chan",Viruses,669,1

METHODS: The effect of favipiravir (FPV) in treating SFTS was evaluated by an integrated analysis on data collected from a single-arm study (n=428), a surveillance study (n=2350) and published data from a randomized controlled trial study (n=145). A 1:1 propensity score matching was performed to include 780 patients: 390 received FPV and 390 received supportive therapy only. Case fatality rates (CFRs), clinical progress, and adverse effects were compared. FINDINGS: FPV treatment had significantly reduced CFR from 20.0% to 9.0% (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.65), however showing heterogeneity when patients were grouped by age, onset-to-admission interval, initial viral load and therapy duration. The effect of FPV was significant only among patients aged ≤70 years, with onset-to-admission interval ≤5 days, therapy duration ≥5 days or baseline viral load ≤1 × 10(6) copies/mL. Age-stratified analysis revealed no benefit in the aging group >70 years, regardless of their sex, onset-to-admission interval, therapy duration or baseline viral load. However, for both ≤60 and 60-70 years groups, therapy duration and baseline viral load differentially affected FPV therapy efficiency.

Early squamous cell neoplasia (ESCN) in the oesophagus is a highly treatable condition. Lesions confined to the mucosal layer can be curatively treated endoscopically. We build a computer-assisted detection (CADe) system that can classify still images or video frames as normal or abnormal with high diagnostic accuracy. Methods. We present a new benchmark dataset containing 68K binary labeled frames extracted from 114 patient videos whose imaged areas have been resected and correlated to histopathology. Our novel convolutional network (CNN) architecture solves the binary classification task and explains what features of the input domain drive the decision-making process of the network. Results. The proposed method achieved an average accuracy of 91.7 % compared to the 94.7 % achieved by a group of 12 senior clinicians. Our novel network architecture produces deeply supervised activation heatmaps that suggest the network is looking at intrapapillary capillary loop (IPCL) patterns when predicting abnormality. Conclusion. We believe that this dataset and baseline method may serve as a reference for future benchmarks on both video frame classification and explainability in the context of ESCN detection. A future work path of high clinical relevance is the extension of the classification to ESCN types.,"Garcia-Peraza-Herrera, Luis C.; Everson, Martin; Lovat, Laurence; Wang, Hsiu-Po; Wang, Wen Lun; Haidry, Rehan; Stoyanov, Danail; Ourselin, Sebastien; Vercauteren, Tom",International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,669,1

Nanobodies are especially useful as components for multivalent constructs as they allow increased valency while maintaining a small molecule size. We here describe a novel, rapid method for the generation of bi- and multivalent nanobody constructs with oriented assembly by Cu-free strain promoted azide-alkyne click chemistry (SPAAC). We used sortase A for ligation of click chemistry functional groups site-specifically to the C-terminus of nanobodies before creating C-to-C-terminal nanobody fusions and 4-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) tetrameric nanobody constructs. We demonstrated the viability of this approach by generating constructs with the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobody Ty1. We compared the ability of the different constructs to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and infectious virus in neutralization assays. The generated dimers neutralized the virus similarly to a nanobody-Fc fusion variant, while a 4-arm PEG based tetrameric Ty1 construct dramatically enhanced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, with an IC(50) in the low picomolar range.","Moliner-Morro, Ainhoa; J.

This study described how, in the context of the early stages of the pandemic, clinicians used telemedicine for OUD in conjunction with in-person care, barriers encountered, and implications for quality of care. Methods In April 2020, we conducted semistructured interviews with clinicians waivered to prescribe buprenorphine. We used maximum variation sampling. We used standard qualitative analysis techniques, consisting of both inductive and deductive approaches, to identify and characterize themes. Results Eighteen clinicians representing 10 states participated. Nearly all interview participants were doing some telemedicine, and more than half were only doing telemedicine visits. Most participants reported changing their typical clinical care patterns to help patients remain at home and minimize exposure to COVID-19. Changes included waiving urine toxicology screening, sending patients home with a larger supply of OUD medications, and requiring fewer visits. Although several participants were serving new patients via telemedicine during the early weeks of the pandemic, others were not. Some clinicians identified positive impacts of telemedicine on the quality of their patient interactions, including increased access for patients. Others noted negative impacts including less structure and accountability, less information to inform clinical decision-making, challenges in establishing a connection, technological challenges, and shorter visits. Conclusions In the context of the pandemic, buprenorphine prescribers quickly transitioned to providing telemedicine visits in high volume; nonetheless, there are still many unknowns, including the quality and safety of widespread use of telemedicine for OUD treatment.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Sousa, Jessica; Raja, Pushpa; Mehrotra, Ateev; Barnett, Michael; Huskamp, Haiden A.",J Subst Abuse Treat,669,20

Despite its prevalence, optimal treatment strategies remain unclear. This article provides a comprehensive review of PVOD treatment options and provides evidence‐based recommendations for their use. METHODS: A systematic review of the Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases was completed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies with defined olfactory outcomes of patients treated for PVOD following medical, surgical, acupuncture, or olfactory training interventions were included. The Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual and Conference on Guideline Standardization (COGS) instrument recommendations were followed in accordance with a previously described, rigorous, iterative process to create an evidence‐based review with recommendations. RESULTS: From 552 initial candidate articles, 36 studies with data for 2183 patients with PVOD were ultimately included. The most common method to assess olfactory outcomes was Sniffin’ Sticks. Broad treatment categories included: olfactory training, systemic steroids, topical therapies, a variety of heterogeneous non‐steroidal oral medications, and acupuncture. CONCLUSION: Based on the available evidence, olfactory training is a recommendation for the treatment of PVOD. The use of short‐term systemic and/or topical steroids is an option in select patients after careful consideration of potential risks of oral steroids. Though some pharmacological investigations offer promising preliminary results for systemic and topical medications alike, a paucity of high‐quality studies limits the ability to make meaningful evidence‐based recommendations for the use of these therapies for the treatment of PVOD.","Hura, Nanki; Xie, Deborah X.; Choby, Garret W.; Schlosser, Rodney J.; Orlov, Cinthia P.; Seal, Stella M.; Rowan, Nicholas R.",Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,669,26

Diabetes increases susceptibility to infection and worsens outcomes for some of the world’s major infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, melioidosis and dengue, but the relationship between diabetes and many neglected tropical diseases is yet to be accurately characterised. There is some evidence that chronic viral infections such as hepatitis B and HIV may predispose to the development of type 2 diabetes by chronic inflammatory and immunometabolic mechanisms. Helminth infections such as schistosomiasis may be protective against the development of diabetes, and this finding opens up new territory for discovery of novel therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. A greater understanding of the impact of diabetes on risks and outcomes for infections causing significant diseases in LMIC is essential in order to develop vaccines and therapies for the growing number of people with diabetes at risk of infection, and to prioritise research agendas, public health interventions and policy. This review seeks to give an overview of the current international diabetes burden, the evidence for interactions between diabetes and infection, immune mechanisms for the interaction, and potential interventions to tackle the dual burden of diabetes and infection.","Dunachie, Susanna; Chamnan, Parinya",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,669,26

AIMS: To assess the magnitude of the psychological status and associated risk factors among nurses in the pandemic center in Wuhan, China. METHODS: In this study, we enrolled nurses from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. The questionnaire was designed to obtain basic information of the participants, and included four psychological assessment scales. We issued the questionnaires at two different points of time. We conducted the first survey on January 29 to February 2 (outbreak period) with 709 eligible responses, and the second survey on February 26 to February 28 (stable period) with 621 eligible responses. The nurses from Wuchang Fangcang shelter hospital were also enrolled in the second survey. RESULTS: During the pandemic, over one-third of nurses suffered from depression, anxiety, and insomnia. In the outbreak period, the nurses showed significantly higher risks for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms than those in the stable period (P < 0.01). Notably, the nurses from the Fangcang shelter hospitals were more likely to present psychological problems than those from other frontline or non-frontline (all P < 0.001) units, especially for insomnia (38.3% with severe insomnia). The nurses from the frontline, with worse physical condition and uncertain concerns about this pandemic as compared to the others, were more likely to bear psychological problems. Thus, online psychological information and sufficient protection conditions were effective interventions to help mitigate psychological distress. The nurses from Fangcang shelter hospitals suffered a significantly higher risk of psychological problems than those from other units. CONCLUSION: The psychological status of nurses needs more attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those who fought in the frontline during the peak of the outbreak.","Zhongxiang, Cai; Qin, Cui; Zhongchun, Liu; Juanjuan, Li; Xuan, Gong; Jingfang, Liu; Zhiying, Wan; Xiaoping, Yuan; Xiaofen, Li; Chuang, Chen; Gaohua, Wang",J Psychiatr Res,669,16

In Lebanon, the pandemic overlapped with an economic crisis, which threatened to exacerbate food insecurity (FI). The present study aims to evaluate the trends and projections of FI in Lebanon due to overlapping health and economic crises. Data from Gallup World Poll (GWP) 2015–2017 surveys conducted in Lebanon on nationally representative adults (n = 3000) were used to assess FI trends and explore its sociodemographic correlates. Predictive models were performed to forecast trends in FI (2018–2022), using GWP data along with income reduction scenarios to estimate the impact of the pandemic and economic crises. Pre crises, trend analyses showed that FI could reach 27% considering wave year and income. Post crises, FI was estimated to reach on average 36% to 39%, considering 50–70% income reduction scenarios among Lebanese population. FI projections are expected to be higher among females compared to males and among older adults compared to younger ones (p < 0.05). These alarming findings call for emergency food security policies and evidence-based programs to mitigate the burden of multiple crises on the FI of Lebanese households and promote resilience for future shocks.","Kharroubi, Samer; Naja, Farah; Diab-El-Harake, Marwa; Jomaa, Lamis",Nutrients,669,16

With the continuing human outbreak of H5N1 beginning in 2003 and the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, focus on influenza and other respiratory viruses has been increased. It has been accepted for decades that international travel via jet aircraft is a major vector for global spread of influenza, and epidemiological differences between tropical and temperate regions observed. Thus we wanted to study how indoor environmental conditions (enclosed locations) in the tropics and winter temperate zones contribute to the aerosol spread of influenza by travelers. To this end, a survey consisting of 632 readings of temperature (T) versus relative humidity (RH) in 389 different enclosed locations air travelers are likely to visit in 8 tropical nations were compared to 102 such readings in 2 Australian cities, including ground transport, hotels, shops, offices and other publicly accessible locations, along with 586 time course readings from aircraft. RESULTS: An influenza transmission risk contour map was developed for T versus RH. Empirical equations were created for estimating: 1. risk relative to temperature and RH, and 2. time parameterized influenza transmission risk. Using the transmission risk contours and equations, transmission risk for each country's locations was compared with influenza reports from the countries. Higher risk enclosed locations in the tropics included new automobile transport, luxury buses, luxury hotels, and bank branches. Most temperate locations were high risk. CONCLUSION: Environmental control is recommended for public health mitigation focused on higher risk enclosed locations. Public health can make use of the methods developed to track potential vulnerability to aerosol influenza. The methods presented can also be used in influenza modeling. Accounting for differential aerosol transmission using T and RH can potentially explain anomalies of influenza epidemiology in addition to seasonality in temperate climates.","Hanley, Brian P; Borup, Birthe",Virol J,669,10

METHODS: This study was institutional review board approved. Reports for CT studies with findings of newly diagnosed diverticulitis within Henry Ford Health System during the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 were reviewed and compared with the same time period in 2019. Total cases of diverticulitis on CT were compared, as well as the prevalence of an associated abscess. A chi-squared analysis was performed to determine the statistical significance of the percentage of patients presenting with an abscess in each year. RESULTS: During the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, 120 patients were identified with CT findings of newly diagnosed diverticulitis with 11.7% of those patients (14 patients) presenting with an associated abscess. During the same time period in 2019, many more CT studies with newly diagnosed diverticulitis were obtained (339), and, compared to 2020, less than half the percentage of those patients had an associated abscess (4.4% or 15 patients). CONCLUSION: Patients with urgent health concerns avoided appropriate and necessary care during the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic. While non-COVID-19 emergency visits were diminished, patients who did present with diverticulitis were more likely to present with greater disease severity as manifested by an associated abscess. Patients must be encouraged to seek care when appropriate and need reassurance that hospitals and their emergency departments are safe to visit. Furthermore, emergency physicians and radiologists in particular should be vigilant during times when emergency volumes are low, such as a future surge in coronavirus patients, other pandemics, snow storms, and holidays as the patients who do present for care are more likely to present at later stages and with serious complications.","Zintsmaster, Michael P.; Myers, Daniel T.",Emerg Radiol,669,24

The origin of the exacerbated cytokine response is unclear. As observed previously, uncontrolled influenza virus replication could strongly influence cytokine production. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between host cytokine responses and viral levels in pandemic influenza critically ill patients. METHODS: Twenty three patients admitted to the ICU with primary viral pneumonia were included in this study. A quantitative PCR based method targeting the M1 influenza gene was developed to quantify pharyngeal viral load. In addition, by using a multiplex based assay, we systematically evaluated host cytokine responses to the viral infection at admission to the ICU. Correlation studies between cytokine levels and viral load were done by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Fifteen patients needed of intubation and ventilation, while eight did not need of mechanical ventilation during ICU hospitalization. Viral load in pharyngeal swabs was 300 fold higher in the group of patients with the worst respiratory condition at admission to the ICU. Pharyngeal viral load directly correlated with plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12p70, IFN-γ, the chemotactic factors MIP-1β, GM-CSF, the angiogenic mediator VEGF and also of the immuno-modulatory cytokine IL-1ra (p < 0.05). Correlation studies demonstrated also the existence of a significant positive association between the levels of these mediators, evidencing that they are simultaneously regulated in response to the virus. CONCLUSIONS: Severe respiratory disease caused by the 2009 pandemic influenza virus is characterized by the existence of a direct association between viral replication and host cytokine response, revealing a potential pathogenic link with the severe disease caused by other influenza subtypes such as H5N1.","Almansa, Raquel; Anton, Andres; Ramirez, Paula; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Banner, David; Pumarola, Tomás; Xu, Luoling; Blanco, Jesús; Ran, Longsi; Lopez-Campos, Guillermo; Martin-Sanchez, Fernando; Socias, Lorenzo; Loza, Ana; Andaluz, David; Maravi, Enrique; Gordón, Mónica; Gallegos, Maria C; Fernandez, Victoria; León, Cristobal; Merino, Pedro; Marcos, Maria Ángeles; Gandía, Francisco; Bobillo, Felipe; Resino, Salvador; Eiros, Jose Mª; Castro, Carmen; Mateo, Paula; Gonzalez-Rivera, Milagros; Rello, Jordi; de Lejarazu, Raul Ortiz; Kelvin, David J; Bermejo-Martin, Jesus F",BMC Infect Dis,669,24

Remdesivir is a broad‐spectrum nucleotide prodrug shown to be effective against enzootic coronaviruses. The pharmacokinetics (PKs) of remdesivir in plasma have recently been described. However, the distribution of its active metabolite nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) to the site of pulmonary infection is unknown in humans. Our objective was to use existing in vivo mouse PK data for remdesivir and its metabolites to develop a mechanism‐based model to allometrically scale and simulate the human PK of remdesivir in plasma and NTP in lung homogenate. Remdesivir and GS‐441524 concentrations in plasma and total phosphorylated nucleoside concentrations in lung homogenate from Ces1c (−/−) mice administered 25 or 50 mg/kg of remdesivir subcutaneously were simultaneously fit to estimate PK parameters. The mouse PK model was allometrically scaled to predict human PK parameters to simulate the clinically recommended 200 mg loading dose followed by 100 mg daily maintenance doses administered as 30‐minute intravenous infusions. Simulations of unbound remdesivir concentrations in human plasma were below 2.48 μM, the 90% maximal inhibitory concentration for SARS‐CoV‐2 inhibition in vitro. Simulations of NTP in the lungs were below high efficacy in vitro thresholds. We have identified a need for alternative dosing strategies to achieve more efficacious concentrations of NTP in human lungs, perhaps by reformulating remdesivir for direct pulmonary delivery.","Hanafin, Patrick O.; Jermain, Brian; Hickey, Anthony J.; Kabanov, Alexander V.; Kashuba, Angela DM.; Sheahan, Timothy P.; Rao, Gauri G.",CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol,669,1

We conducted a detailed global study of Internet search patterns related to COVID-19 symptoms in multiple languages across 32 countries on six continents. We found that Internet search patterns reveal a robust temporal pattern of disease progression for COVID-19: Initial symptoms of fever, dry cough, sore throat and chills are followed by shortness of breath an average of 5.22 days [95% CI 3.30-7.14] after symptom onset, matching the precise clinical course reported in the medical literature. Furthermore, we found that increases in COVID-19-symptom-related searches predict increases in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths 18.53 days [95% CI 15.98-21.08] and 22.16 days [95% CI 20.33-23.99] in advance, respectively. This is the first study to show that Internet search patterns can be used to reveal the detailed clinical course of a disease. These data can be used to track and predict the local spread of COVID-19 before widespread laboratory testing becomes available in each country, helping to guide the current public health response.","Lu, T.; Reis, B.

It is unknown what effect this has had on the physical and mental health of student athletes. Objective: Identify the impact of playing a sport during the CoVID19 pandemic on the health of student athletes. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Sample recruited via email. Patients or Other Participants: 559 Wisconsin high school athletes (age=15.7+1.2 yrs., female=44%) from 44 high schools completed an online survey in October 2020. A total of 171 (31%) athletes played (PLY) a fall sport, while 388 (69%) did not play (DNP). Main Outcome Measure(s): Demographics included: sex, grade and sports played. Assessments included the General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. Univariable comparisons between the two groups were made via t-tests or chi-square tests. Means for each continuous outcome measure were compared between the groups by ANOVA models that controlled for Age, Sex, Teaching method (Virtual, Hybrid, or In-person), and the % of students eligible for free lunch. RESULTS: PLY group participants were less likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety (PLY=6.6%, DNP=44.1%, p<0.001) and depression (PLY=18.2%, DNP=40.4%, p<0.001). PLY athletes reported higher (better) PFABS scores (mean: [95%CI]), (PLY=23.2[22.0,24.5], DNP=16.4[15.0,17.8], p <0.001) and higher (better) PedsQL total scores (PLY=88.4[85.9,90.9], DNP=79.6[76.8,82.4], p <0.001).

Here we report a proteomic screen for cellular factors that interact with the cytoplasmic tail of S. We confirm interactions with the COPI and COPII vesicle coats, ERM family actin regulators, and the WIPI3 autophagy component. The COPII binding site promotes exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, and although binding to COPI should retain S in the early Golgi where viral budding occurs, there is a suboptimal histidine residue in the recognition motif. As a result, S leaks to the surface where it accumulates and can direct the formation of multinucleate syncytia. Thus, the trafficking signals in the tail of S indicate that syncytia play a role in the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle.","Cattin-Ortolá, Jérôme; Welch, Lawrence G.; Maslen, Sarah L.; Papa, Guido; James, Leo C.; Munro, Sean",Nat Commun,669,1

METHODS: Observational analysis of the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey from 2005 to 2015. Primary outcomes were hospital-based ED closure and merger. Secondary outcomes were yearly ED visits per hospital-based ED and yearly hospital admissions per hospital bed. RESULTS: The total number of hospital-based EDs decreased from 4,500 in 2005 to 4,460 in 2015, with 200 closures, 138 mergers, and 160 new hospital-based EDs. While yearly ED visits per hospital-based ED exhibited a 28.6% relative increase (from 25,083 to 32,248), yearly hospital admissions per hospital bed had a 3.3% relative increase (from 45.4 to 43.9) from 2005 to 2015. The number of hospital admissions and hospital beds did not change significantly in urban areas and declined in rural areas. ED visits grew more uniformly across urban and rural areas.

The authors report that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had significant virus reducing effects, and that dual treatment of both HCQ and azithromycin further enhanced virus reduction. This data has triggered speculation whether these drugs should be considered as candidates for the treatment of severe COVID-19. However, questions have been raised regarding the study's data integrity, statistical analyses, and experimental design. We therefore reanalysed the original data to interrogate the main claims of the paper. Here we apply Bayesian statistics to assess the robustness of the original papers claims by testing four variants of the data: 1) The original data; 2) Data including patients who deteriorated; 3) Data including patients who deteriorated with exclusion of untested patients in the comparison group; 4) Data that includes patients who deteriorated with the assumption that untested patients were negative. To ask if HCQ monotherapy is effective, we performed an A/B test for a model which assumes a positive effect, compared to a model of no effect. We find that the statistical evidence is highly sensitive to these data variants. Statistical evidence for the positive effect model ranged from strong for the original data (BF ~11), to moderate when including patients who deteriorated (BF ~4.35), to anecdotal when excluding untested patients (BF ~2), and to anecdotal negative evidence if untested patients were assumed positive (BF ~0.6). To assess whether HCQ is more effective when combined with AZ, we performed the same tests, and found only anecdotal evidence for the positive effect model for the original data (BF ~2.8), and moderate evidence for all other variants of the data (BF ~5.6). Our analyses only explore the effects of different assumptions about excluded and untested patients. These assumptions are not adequately reported, nor are they justified in the original paper, and we find that varying them causes substantive changes to the evidential support for the main claims of the original paper. This statistical uncertainty is exacerbated by the fact that the treatments were not randomised, and subject to several confounding variables including the patients' consent to treatment, different care centres, and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, while the viral load measurements were noisy, showing multiple reversals between test outcomes, there is greater certainty around other clinical outcomes such as the 4 patients who seriously deteriorated. The fact that all of these belonged to the HCQ monotherapy group should be assigned greater weight when evaluating the potential clinical efficacy of HCQ. Randomised controlled trials are currently underway, and will be critical in resolving this uncertainty as to whether HCQ and AZ are effective as a treatment for COVID-19.","Hulme, Oliver J; Wagenmakers, Eric-Jan; Damkier, Per; Madelung, Christopher Fugl; Siebner, Hartwig Roman; Helweg-Larsen, Jannik; Gronau, Quentin; Benfield, Thomas Lars; Madsen, Kristoffer H",,669,28

We analyze data from the Sentinel-5P and the Himawari-8 satellites to examine concentrations of NO2, HCHO, SO2, and CO, and the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the BTH, Wuhan, Seoul, and Tokyo regions in February 2019 and February 2020. Results show that most of the concentrations of pollutants are lower than those of February 2019. Compared to other pollutants, NO2 experienced the most significant reductions by almost 54%, 83%, 33%, and 19% decrease in BTH, Wuhan, Seoul, and Tokyo, respectively. The greatest reductions in pollutants occurred in Wuhan, with a decrease of almost 83%, 11%, 71%, and 4% in the column densities of NO2, HCHO, SO2, and CO, respectively, and a decrease of about 62% in the AOD. Although NO2, CO, and formaldehyde concentrations decreased in the Seoul and Tokyo metropolitan areas compared to the previous year, concentrations of SO2 showed an increase in these two regions due to the effect of transport from polluted upwind regions. We also show that meteorological factors were not the main reason for the dramatic reductions of pollutants in the atmosphere. Moreover, an investigation of the HCHO/NO2 ratio shows that in many regions of East China, particularly in Wuhan, ozone production in February 2020 is less NOX saturated during the daytime than it was in February 2019. With large reductions in the concentrations of NO2 during lockdown situations, we find that significant increases in surface ozone in East China from February 2019 to February 2020 are likely the result of less reaction of NO and O3 caused by significantly reduced NOX concentrations and less NOX saturation in East China during the daytime.","Ghahremanloo, Masoud; Lops, Yannic; Choi, Yunsoo; Mousavinezhad, Seyedali",Sci Total Environ,669,24

By using ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively, the presence of extracellular hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), e antigen (HBeAg), and HBV DNA were measured. The levels of intracellular HBV DNA and mRNA were determined by using Southern blot or reverse-transcription-PCR, respectively. Intracellular distribution of antigen were measured by Western blot. A 1995 μmol/L concentration of the commercially-available hepatitis B drug, adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), was required to achieve 50% cytotoxicity against cultured cells (CC(50)) by day nine; in contrast, only 1747 μmol/L of Compound 1 was required for the same result. Treatment of HepG2.2.15 cells with Compound 1 effectively suppress the secretion of HBV antigens and HBV DNA in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner.

The political process is often seen as integral to bringing about change, largely due to orthodox understandings of the ‘nature’ of law, in which law is made by parliaments and capable of revision in only limited instances. In recent years, theorists such as Bruno Latour (2013, 2009), Andreas Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos (2015) and Serge Gutwirth (2015) have taken a more expansive view of the nature of law and its effects. According to these theorists, law also emerges from outside the political process, including through various practices such as those of professionals working within legal systems, and those engaged in resistance, navigation and subversion (Seear 2020). This article explores these processes using Karen Barad's (2015) work on lightning. As we will explain, Barad presents lightning as a ‘queer’, non-linear, uncertain and indeterminate phenomenon, using it to understand causation in new ways. Along with Barad's ideas, the article draws on interview data (N = 35) collected for two research projects in Canada. These interviews were conducted with senior drug use-related policy makers, service providers, advocates and lawyers based in British Columbia and Ontario, Canada. The interviews explore how key Canadian experts view drug law, debates about law and policy and whether they support reform. We also explore how these experts navigate the criminalisation of drugs and whether any insights can be drawn from their practices, including their attempts to navigate, subvert or change the law. First we consider experts’ concern about current prohibitionist legal frameworks, finding it widespread, along with appetite for change. Second, we examine experts’ accounts of strategies used for working around or challenging punitive frameworks. We find that change, like lightning, is complicated and messy; simplistic approaches to changes are not always possible, and may in fact make matters worse. There are multiple, unpredictable effects in engaging and resisting law, and thus difficulty in tackling criminalisation in any clear and simple way. Practices and processes of responding to and resisting drug-use criminalisation can thus be understood in terms that reflect the ‘queer’, indeterminate, unpredictable and multidirectional nature of Barad's lightning. In concluding, we note that this way of understanding legal processes and resistance has implications for the future of Canadian drug policy, including debates about whether it is possible to work within a framework of overarching criminalisation.","Seear, Kate; Fraser, Suzanne; Boyd, Susan",Int J Drug Policy,669,24

High levels of social restrictions were implemented for the third time in January 2021 to control the second wave and resulting increases in hospitalisations and deaths. Easing those restrictions must balance multiple challenging priorities, weighing the risk of more deaths and hospitalisations against damage done to mental health, incomes and standards of living, education and provision of non‐Covid‐19 healthcare. METHODS: Weekly and monthly officially published data for 2020/21 were used to estimate the influence of seasonality and social restrictions on the spread of COVID‐19 by age group, on the economy and on healthcare services. These factors were combined with the estimated impact of vaccinations and immunity from past infections into a model that retrospectively reflected the actual numbers of reported deaths closely both in 2020 and early 2021. The model was applied prospectively to the next 6 months to evaluate the impact of different speeds of easing social restrictions. RESULTS: The results show vaccinations as significantly reducing the number of hospitalisations and deaths. The central estimate is that relative to rapid easing, the avoided loss of 57 000 life‐years from a strategy of relatively slow easing over the next several months comes at a cost in terms of GDP reduction of around £0.4 million/life‐year loss avoided. This is over 10 times higher than the usual limit the NHS uses for spending against Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) saved. Alternative assumptions for key factors affecting the spread of the virus give significantly different trade‐offs between costs and benefits of different speeds of easing. Disruption of non‐Covid‐19 Healthcare provision also increases in times of higher levels of social restrictions. CONCLUSION: In most cases, the results favour a somewhat faster easing of restrictions in England than current policy implies.","Miles, David K.; Heald, Adrian H.; Stedman, Michael",Int J Clin Pract,669,27

An alternative is to develop filter media for air conditioners that have biocidal properties. This study aimed to verify the biocidal effect of a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter medium modified with the deposition of nanoparticles on its surface. For this purpose, Ag, TiO(2), and Ag/TiO(2) nanoparticles were used and the antimicrobial activities of these nanomaterials against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans microorganisms were evaluated, as well as the biocidal efficacy of the modified HEPA filter with these nanomaterials in a real environment. The percentages of elimination obtained for the Ag, TiO(2), and Ag/TiO(2) nanomaterials, respectively, were 53%, 63%, and 68% (E. coli); 67%, 67%, and 69% (S. aureus); and 68%, 73%, and 75% (C. albicans). The HEPA filter media had their surfaces modified by aspersion and deposition of Ag, TiO(2), and Ag/TiO(2) nanomaterials. We could conclude that the nanoparticles adhered to the filter medium do not affect its permeability. The modified filters were arranged in an internal environment (bathroom) for the collection of the bioaerosols, and after the collection, the filter cake was plated and arranged to grow in a liquid medium.

There is also little information on the temporal components of this relationship.

We also show that the inclusion of spatially-distributed variables reduces uncertainty in mortality rate predictions in each census year when compared with a baseline model. Our results suggest that geographic mortality models should incorporate nonlocal information (e.g., spatial neighbors) to lower the variance of their mortality estimates, and point to a more in-depth analysis of sociospatial spillover effects on mortality rates.","Alshaabi, Thayer; Dewhurst, David R.; Bagrow, James P.; Dodds, Peter S.; Danforth, Christopher M.",PLoS One,669,16

In response, severely affected countries have had to impose a range of public health strategies achieved via nonpharmaceutical interventions. Broadly, these strategies have fallen into two categories: 1) “mitigation,” which aims to achieve herd immunity by allowing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus to spread through the population while mitigating disease burden, and 2) “suppression,” aiming to drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and halt endogenous transmission in the target population. Using an age-structured transmission model, parameterized to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United Kingdom, we assessed the long-term prospects of success using both of these approaches. We simulated a range of different nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios incorporating social distancing applied to differing age groups. Our modeling confirmed that suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is possible with plausible levels of social distancing over a period of months, consistent with observed trends. Notably, our modeling did not support achieving herd immunity as a practical objective, requiring an unlikely balancing of multiple poorly defined forces. Specifically, we found that 1) social distancing must initially reduce the transmission rate to within a narrow range, 2) to compensate for susceptible depletion, the extent of social distancing must be adaptive over time in a precise yet unfeasible way, and 3) social distancing must be maintained for an extended period to ensure the healthcare system is not overwhelmed.","Brett, Tobias S.; Rohani, Pejman",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,669,16
