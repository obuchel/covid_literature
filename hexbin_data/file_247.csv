918,Pulmonary sequelae in a patient recovered from swine flu,2012,"The pandemic of swine flu (H1N1) influenza spread to involve the whole world rapidly. Many patients manifested a mild clinical illness but some developed pneumonia and respiratory failure. High mortality was observed in patients with severe disease. Among survivors, studies are limited. Ground-glass opacities on a high-resolution computerized tomography scan and reduced diffusion capacity were noted after 3 months in a study. But long-term complications in patients with swine flu pneumonia have not been studied well. We are presenting an unusual case of swine flu pneumonia who developed interstitial lung disease after recovery.","Singh, Virendra; Sharma, Bharat Bhushan; Patel, Vivek",Lung India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3424870/,247
1290,Strategies for Designing Transgenic DNA Constructs,2013-03-08,"Generation and characterization of transgenic mice are important elements of biomedical research. In recent years, transgenic technology has become more versatile and sophisticated, mainly because of the incorporation of recombinase-mediated conditional expression and targeted insertion, site-specific endonuclease-mediated genome editing, siRNA-mediated gene knockdown, various inducible gene expression systems, and fluorescent protein marking and tracking techniques. Site-specific recombinases (such as PhiC31) and engineered endonucleases (such as ZFN and Talen) have significantly enhanced our ability to target transgenes into specific genomic loci, but currently a great majority of transgenic mouse lines are continuingly being created using the conventional random insertion method. A major challenge for using this conventional method is that the genomic environment at the integration site has a substantial influence on the expression of the transgene. Although our understanding of such chromosomal position effects and our means to combat them are still primitive, adhering to some general guidelines can significantly increase the odds of successful transgene expression. This chapter first discusses the major problems associated with transgene expression, and then describes some of the principles for using plasmid and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) for generating transgenic constructs. Finally, the strategies for conducting each of the major types of transgenic research are discussed, including gene overexpression, promoter characterization, cell-lineage tracing, mutant complementation, expression of double or multiple transgenes, siRNA knockdown, and conditional and inducible systems.","Liu, Chengyu",Lipoproteins and Cardiovascular Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3815551/,247
4433,Analgosedation for diagnostic and interventional procedures: a countrywide survey of pediatric centers in Germany,2020-02-03,"BACKGROUND: As more and more diagnostic and interventional options are becoming available for use in pediatric patients, techniques of procedural sedation analgesia (PSA) are being administered in considerably growing numbers as well. AIMS: The objective of this research effort was to conduct the first countrywide survey on the status quo of sedation analgesia as delivered to children and adolescents in Germany. METHODS: We dispatched letters to all pediatric hospital settings in Germany (n = 305), including a questionnaire that had been developed with existing guidelines taken into account. Its items were designed to elucidate the current practice of PSA throughout these pediatric centers regarding (a) organizational structures and (b) standards of medication and staffing. RESULTS: A total of 138 centers returned the questionnaire, hence the response rate was 45.2%. Numerous centers had implemented adequate structures and staffing standards. Deficits were nevertheless identified, most notably in terms of on-location equipment and staff provided to deliver sedations. Essential items of equipment were not provided in up to 26.8% of centers. Adequate staffing was not provided in up to 44.2% of centers, depending on the diagnostic or interventional procedures for which the PSA was delivered. The most widely used sedative agents were midazolam, ketamine/esketamine, and propofol. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate care structures for the management of procedural sedation analgesia have been implemented by many pediatric centers in Germany. On the downside, these findings also reveal deficits that will take efforts to be eliminated.","Sauer, Harald; Lobenhofer, Marie; Abdul-Khaliq, Hashim",Ital J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6998146/,247
4445,Approaches for patients with very high MELD scores,2019-02-23,"In the era of the “sickest first” policy, patients with very high model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores have been increasingly admitted to the intensive care unit with the expectation that they will receive a liver transplant (LT) in the absence of improvement on supportive therapies. Such patients are often admitted in a context of acute-on-chronic liver failure with extrahepatic failures. Sequential assessment of scores or classification based on organ failures within the first days after admission help to stratify the risk of mortality in this population. Although the prognosis of severely ill cirrhotic patients has recently improved, transplant-free mortality remains high. LT is still the only curative treatment in this population. Yet, the increased relative scarcity of graft resource must be considered alongside the increased risk of losing a graft in the initial postoperative period when performing LT in “too sick to transplant” patients. Variables associated with poor immediate post-LT outcomes have been identified in large studies. Despite this, the performance of scores based on these variables is still insufficient. Consideration of a patient’s comorbidities and frailty is an appealing predictive approach in this population that has proven of great value in many other diseases. So far, local expertise remains the last safeguard to LT. Using this expertise, data are accumulating on favourable post-LT outcomes in very high MELD populations, particularly when LT is performed in a situation of stabilization/improvement of organ failures in selected candidates. The absence of “definitive” contraindications and the control of “dynamic” contraindications allow a “transplantation window” to be defined. This window must be identified swiftly after admission given the poor short-term survival of patients with very high MELD scores. In the absence of any prospect of LT, withdrawal of care could be discussed to ensure respect of patient life, dignity and wishes.","Artru, Florent; Samuel, Didier",JHEP Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7001538/,247
4600,Labral calcification plays a key role in hip pain and symptoms in femoroacetabular impingement,2020-02-28,"The use of vaccines have resulted in a remarkable improvement in global health. It has saved several lives, reduced treatment costs and raised the quality of animal and human lives. Current traditional vaccines came empirically with either vague or completely no knowledge of how they modulate our immune system. Even at the face of potential vaccine design advance, immune-related concerns (as seen with specific vulnerable populations, cases of emerging/re-emerging infectious disease, pathogens with complex lifecycle and antigenic variability, need for personalized vaccinations, and concerns for vaccines' immunological safety -specifically vaccine likelihood to trigger non-antigen-specific responses that may cause autoimmunity and vaccine allergy) are being raised. And these concerns have driven immunologists toward research for a better approach to vaccine design that will consider these challenges. Currently, immunoinformatics has paved the way for a better understanding of some infectious disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, immune system response and computational vaccinology. The importance of this immunoinformatics in the study of infectious diseases is diverse in terms of computational approaches used, but is united by common qualities related to host–pathogen relationship. Bioinformatics methods are also used to assign functions to uncharacterized genes which can be targeted as a candidate in vaccine design and can be a better approach toward the inclusion of women that are pregnant into vaccine trials and programs. The essence of this review is to give insight into the need to focus on novel computational, experimental and computation-driven experimental approaches for studying of host–pathogen interactions and thus making a case for its use in vaccine development.","Oli, Angus Nnamdi; Obialor, Wilson Okechukwu; Ifeanyichukwu, Martins Ositadimma; Odimegwu, Damian Chukwu; Okoyeh, Jude Nnaemeka; Emechebe, George Ogonna; Adejumo, Samson Adedeji; Ibeanu, Gordon C",Immunotargets Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7049754/,247
5713,American College of Chest Physicians and American Association for Bronchology Consensus Statement: Prevention of Flexible Bronchoscopy-Associated Infection,2015-12-29,"The immune genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are classical examples for high levels of genetic diversity and non-neutral evolution. This is particularly true for the regions containing the antigen-binding sites as, for instance, in the exon 2 of the MHC class II gene DRB. We surveyed, for the first time in the order Chiroptera, the genetic diversity within this exon in the sac-winged bat Saccopteryx bilineata. We detected 11 alleles among 85 bats, of which 79 were sampled in one population. Pairwise comparisons revealed that interallelic sequence differences ranged between 3 and 22%, although nucleotide substitutions were not evenly distributed along the exon sequence. This was most probably the result of intragenic recombination. High levels of sequence divergence and significantly more nonsynonymous than synonymous substitutions (d(N)/d(S)>1) suggest long-term balancing selection. Thus, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that recombination gives rise to new alleles at the DRB locus of the sac-winged bat, and these are maintained in the population through balancing selection. In this respect, the sac-winged bat closely resembles other mammalian species.","Mayer, F; Brunner, A",Heredity (Edinb),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094720/,247
7446,The enteric flora in childhood disease —diarrhea,1977-11-11,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are quite sensitive to low pH. To determine whether this characteristic might be a therapeutic target, we evaluated the sensitivity of HRV to low-pH buffers in vitro and in vivo. Our findings confirm that low pH inhibited replication of most HRVs and reduced the replication of influenza virus. Preliminary experiments verified that the surface pH of the human nasopharynx could be transiently lowered to pH ∼4.0 by topical administration of citrate/phosphate (CP) buffers, which was well tolerated. In a pilot experimental colds study, intranasal administration of CP buffer, compared with normal saline, reduced viral shedding by 1 log unit (10(3) vs. 10(4) 50%tissue culture infective dose/mL; P < .01), although respiratory symptoms were not significantly reduced. These findings demonstrate that low-pH buffers have antiviral activity in vivo and suggest that a larger clinical trial is warranted to determine whether this approach could reduce rates of viral transmission.","Gern, James E.; Mosser, Anne G.; Swenson, Cheri A.; Rennie, Paul J.; England, R.

8511,Primum Non Nocere,2015-12-16,"We studied the macromolecular permeability of segments of jejunum from 2-wk-old piglets after the animals had been experimentally infected with an invasive enteric virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Jejunal segments were mounted in Ussing chambers at stages of the infection, and permeability was measured using three probe molecules of differing molecular weights. In control tissue, permeability to horseradish peroxidase was 2.6 times higher across segments with Peyer's patches than across segments without Peyer's patches, whereas polyethylene glycol 4000 and mannitol permeabilities were the same in patch and nonpatch segments. Twelve hours after infection, when virus had invaded the mucosa causing a structural lesion, and before diarrhea had begun, horseradish peroxidase permeability increased in non-patch-containing segments to equal that across patch-containing tissue. At this early 12-h stage, polyethylene glycol 4000 and mannitol permeation were unchanged in patchcontaining segments compared with controls. Ninety-six hours after transmissible gastroenteritis infection, when diarrhea was severe, horseradish peroxidase permeability in patch-free segments had returned to normal and patch-containing tissue permeability was diminished below control levels. Increased macromolecular permeability appears to occur only in the very early invasive stage of this viral enteritis and only in patch-free segments. Any consideration of the immunologic relevance of these complex phenomena must take into account the specialized function of the Peyer's patch regions of the small intestine.","Keljo, David J.; Butler, Daniel G.; Hamilton, J.

10009,"Clinical assessment of Optivate(®), a high‐purity concentrate of factor VIII with von Willebrand factor, in the management of patients with haemophilia A",2011-03-04,"In assessing the situation revealed by the survey, we concluded that in general when sufficient numbers of founders were available and attention paid to the animals general and specific needs, including preventative medicine, the captive populations have done reasonably well. Is is obvious that some small groups, such as the small African antelope and the duikers, need highly specialised care and there is a great deal of work still to be done on their husbandry. The mountain or alpine species have been fairly successful with the goats showing the greatest adaptability. We feel there are grounds for optimism for the future of such animals as the Rocky mountain goat, the Japanese serow and even the Blue sheep. Of those species whose captive future is still in doubt, particularly those which are threatened in the wild, our researches indicate that concentrated efforts should be made to obtain sufficient founder stock to establish self‐sustaining populations as a hedge against total disaster in the wild. We felt that the evidence was strong that any of the ungulate species reviewed could be successfully maintained in captivity given the right circumstances. Basically, the husbandry procedures of all the reporting zoos were similar, although, of course, each zoo had its own variations. In some cases these measurably affected the success of the animal population. In the last 20 to 25 years inter‐zoo co‐operation and sharing of information has greatly expanded. Nevertheless we would now urge that even more emphasis should be put on the exchange of information to provide each zoo with up‐ to‐date data which would ensure that all zoos are kept abreast with the 'state of the art. With such a spirit of co‐operation the prospect of managing species as total captive populations appears to be practical and promising.","THOMAS, WARREN D.; BARNES, ROBERT; CROTTY, MICHAEL; JONES, MARVIN",Int Zoo Yearb,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165825/,247

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dual angiogenesis blockade with bevacizumab and sorafenib in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients and Methods: Patients who had received no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens in any setting were treated with sorafenib 200 mg as a single oral dose daily plus bevacizumab intravenously 5 mg/kg every other week. Response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). Results: Eighteen patients were enrolled. Median age was 56 yo, all had good performance status KPS of 0 or 1, and 17 patients had received 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. Median PFS was 2.8 months. There were no complete or partial responses; 3 patients had stable disease for >6 months. Toxicity was substantial with 9 (50 %) patients reporting Grade 3 toxicity. Seven (39 %) patients discontinued therapy due to adverse events including hypertension (N = 2), GI toxicity (N = 1), sensory neuropathy (N = 1), rash (N = 1), pain (N = 1) and wound complication (N = 1). Given the lack of clear efficacy and increased toxicity, accrual was terminated. Conclusion: The combination of sorafenib and bevacizumab has substantial toxicity and minimal efficacy in patients with previously treated metastatic breast cancer. Further study of this combination is not recommended.","Mina, Lida A.; Yu, Menggang; Johnson, Cynthia; Burkhardt, Cyndi; Miller, Kathy D.; Zon, Robin",Invest New Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3771371/,247
13013,Beliefs and Information Seeking in Patients With Cancer in Southwest China: Survey Study,2020-08-21,"BACKGROUND: Integrated data repositories (IDRs), also referred to as clinical data warehouses, are platforms used for the integration of several data sources through specialized analytical tools that facilitate data processing and analysis. IDRs offer several opportunities for clinical data reuse, and the number of institutions implementing an IDR has grown steadily in the past decade. OBJECTIVE: The architectural choices of major IDRs are highly diverse and determining their differences can be overwhelming. This review aims to explore the underlying models and common features of IDRs, provide a high-level overview for those entering the field, and propose a set of guiding principles for small- to medium-sized health institutions embarking on IDR implementation. METHODS: We reviewed manuscripts published in peer-reviewed scientific literature between 2008 and 2020, and selected those that specifically describe IDR architectures. Of 255 shortlisted articles, we found 34 articles describing 29 different architectures. The different IDRs were analyzed for common features and classified according to their data processing and integration solution choices. RESULTS: Despite common trends in the selection of standard terminologies and data models, the IDRs examined showed heterogeneity in the underlying architecture design. We identified 4 common architecture models that use different approaches for data processing and integration. These different approaches were driven by a variety of features such as data sources, whether the IDR was for a single institution or a collaborative project, the intended primary data user, and purpose (research-only or including clinical or operational decision making). CONCLUSIONS: IDR implementations are diverse and complex undertakings, which benefit from being preceded by an evaluation of requirements and definition of scope in the early planning stage. Factors such as data source diversity and intended users of the IDR influence data flow and synchronization, both of which are crucial factors in IDR architecture planning.","Gagalova, Kristina K; Leon Elizalde, M Angelica; Portales-Casamar, Elodie; Görges, Matthias",JMIR Form Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7484778/,247

J. Clin. Med. 2020, 9, 2368",2020-10-27,"Aging increases risk for ischemic vascular diseases. Bone marrow–derived hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) are known to stimulate vascular regeneration. Activation of either the Mas receptor (MasR) by angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) or angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) stimulates vasoreparative functions in HSPCs. This study tested if aging is associated with decreased ACE2 expression in HSPCs and if Ang-(1-7) restores vasoreparative functions. Flow cytometric enumeration of Lin(−)CD45(low)CD34(+) cells was carried out in peripheral blood of male or female individuals (22–83 years of age). Activity of ACE2 or the classical angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was determined in lysates of HSPCs. Lin(−)Sca-1(+)cKit(+) (LSK) cells were isolated from young (3–5 months) or old (20–22 months) mice, and migration and proliferation were evaluated. Old mice were treated with Ang-(1-7), and mobilization of HSPCs was determined following ischemia induced by femoral ligation. A laser Doppler blood flow meter was used to determine blood flow. Aging was associated with decreased number (Spearman r = − 0.598, P < 0.0001, n = 56), decreased ACE2 (r = − 0.677, P < 0.0004), and increased ACE activity (r = 0.872, P < 0.0001) (n = 23) in HSPCs. Migration or proliferation of LSK cells in basal or in response to stromal-derived factor-1α in old cells is attenuated compared to young, and these dysfunctions were reversed by Ang-(1-7). Ischemia increased the number of circulating LSK cells in young mice, and blood flow to ischemic areas was recovered. These responses were impaired in old mice but were restored by treatment with Ang-(1-7). These results suggest that activation of ACE2 or MasR would be a promising approach for enhancing ischemic vascular repair in aging.","Joshi, S.; Chittimalli, K.; Jahan, J.; Vasam, G.; Jarajapu, Y.

It is unclear, however, whether ELS affects normative age-related changes in white matter (WM) morphology, and if such maturational differences are associated with risk for internalizing psychopathology. We conducted comprehensive interviews in a cross-sectional sample of young adolescents (N = 156; 89 F; Ages 9–14) to assess lifetime exposure to stress and objective cumulative ELS severity. We used diffusion-weighted imaging to measure WM fixel-based morphometry and tested the effects of age and ELS on WM fiber density and cross-section (FDC), and associations between WM FDC and internalizing problems. Age was positively associated with FDC in all WM tracts; greater ELS severity was related to stronger age-WM associations in several association tracts connecting the frontal lobes with limbic, parietal, and occipital regions, including bilateral superior and inferior longitudinal and uncinate fasciculi (UF). Among older adolescents with greater ELS severity, a higher UF FDC was associated with fewer internalizing problems. Greater ELS severity predicted more mature WM morphometry in tracts implicated in emotion regulation and cognitive processing. More phenotypically mature UF WM may be adaptive against internalizing psychopathology in adolescents exposed to ELS.","Chahal, Rajpreet; Kirshenbaum, Jaclyn S.; Ho, Tiffany C.; Mastrovito, Dana; Gotlib, Ian H.",Dev Cogn Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7750321/,247

17764,Accountability in clinical trial diversity: The buck stops where?,2021-05-23,"In recent years, refined molecular methods coupled with powerful high throughput sequencing technologies have increased the potential of virus discovery in clinical samples. However, host genetic material remains a complicating factor that interferes with discovery of novel viruses in solid tissue samples as the relative abundance of the virus material is low. Physical enrichment processing methods, although usually complicated, labor-intensive, and costly, have proven to be successful for improving sensitivity of virus detection in complex samples. In order to further increase detectability, we studied the application of fast and simple high-throughput virus enrichment methods on tissue homogenates. Probe sonication in high EDTA concentrations, organic extraction with Vertrel™ XF, or a combination of both, were applied prior to chromatography-like enrichment using Capto™ Core 700 resin, after which effects on virus detection sensitivity by the VIDISCA method were determined. Sonication in the presence of high concentrations of EDTA showed the best performance with an increased proportion of viral reads, up to 9.4 times, yet minimal effect on the host background signal. When this sonication procedure in high EDTA concentrations was followed by organic extraction with Vertrel™ XF and two rounds of core bead chromatography enrichment, an increase up to 10.5 times in the proportion of viral reads in the processed samples was achieved, with reduction of host background sequencing. We present a simple and semi-high-throughput method that can be used to enrich homogenized tissue samples for viral reads.","Folgueiras-González, Alba; van den Braak, Robin; Deijs, Martin; van der Hoek, Lia; de Groof, Ad",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8145099/,247

Most college courses in microbiology emphasize the biology of bacteria and viruses, including those that are human pathogens. One challenging aspect of the course is to introduce students to epidemiology, which considers the causes, dispersal, and control of disease. Although disease transmission models have helped develop successful strategies for managing epidemics, most science students are unaware of their advantages and complexities. To address this challenge, the microbiology course at Wofford College has incorporated a sequence of three or four laboratories on modeling the spread of disease. Emphasis in Computational Science students who have studied modeling and simulation in depth serve as laboratory assistants and mentors. Evidence from test scores and self-assessment support the hypothesis that the sequence of laboratories has improved student understanding of human disease dynamics and demonstrated the utility of computational models.","Shiflet, George W.; Shiflet, Angela B.",Computational Science - ICCS 2009,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122839/,247

Several methods have been used to evaluate the progression of chronic liver diseases, including the Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) score, MELD, MESO index, MELD-Na joint formula, iMELD formula, King’s College Hospital (KCH) score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and the Tongji prognostic predictor model (TPPM) score. 2. Technologies used for early screening of severe hepatitis B include gene-based diagnostic techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction, gene sequence analysis, gene chips, and GWAS. Protein-based methods include two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry; and epigenetic-based methods include assays of DNA methylation and histone modifications. In addition, meta-genomics and systematic biology have been used to analyze microbial sequence and function. 3. Early-warning parameters for severe hepatitis B mainly include serum concentrations of ALT, AST, total bilirubin, albumin and pre-albumin, and cholinesterase; and measurements of blood ammonia, prothrombin time and prothrombin activity. Several new parameters related to severe hepatitis B have been identified, including gene mutations (e.g. HBV 1896 site mutation and 1762/1764 double mutation), genetic molecular targets (e.g. CXCL10-201 g/A, IL10-592 t/C, ESR1 IVS1-401 t/C, TBX21-1993 t/C, and ICAM1 R241-E469), immune factors (e.g. TNF-α, reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, sCD163, hfgl2, HLA-DR, NK cells, CTL, Th17 cells, Treg cells, PD-1/PD-L), and metabolic factors (e.g. lecithin, fat amides and bile acids). 4. The clinical diagnosis of severe hepatitis B is mainly based on clinical manifestations, including jaundice, coagulation disorders, hepatic encephalopathy and ascites, and laboratory tests, including prothrombin time, prothrombin activity, international normalized ratio, AST/ALT ratio, and serum concentrations of albumin, bilirubin, cholinesterase, cholesterol, lactic acid, and alpha-fetoprotein. 5. At present, there are differences among countries in the standard for diagnosing liver failure. In China, liver failure is referred to as severe hepatitis, whereas, in western counties, liver failure caused by viruses is diagnosed as fulminant hepatitis and refers only to acute liver failure. The main difference is that, in China, the concept of acute fulminant hepatitis has been extended to patients without encephalopathy. In contrast, hepatic encephalopathy II is a necessary condition to diagnose severe hepatitis in the United States, Europe and Japan. 6. Liver failure can be subdivided into acute and chronic liver failure. Acute liver failure includes acute and sub-acute liver failure, and chronic liver failure includes acute-on-chronic and chronic decompensated liver failure. To date, hepatic encephalopathy has been necessary for the diagnosis of acute, but not chronic, liver failure, which is characterized by decompensated liver.","Chen, Zhi; Ning, Qin; Chen, Guang",Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Hepatitis B,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498885/,247

The intrinsic properties given by the self-produced extracellular biofilm matrix confer high resistance to antibiotics, triggering infections difficult to treat. Therefore, novel antibiofilm strategies targeting matrix components are urgently needed. The Biofilm Associated Protein, Bap, expressed by staphylococcal species adopts functional amyloid-like structures as scaffolds of the biofilm matrix. In this work we have focused on identifying agents targeting Bap-related amyloid-like aggregates as a strategy to combat S. aureus biofilm-related infections. We identified that the flavonoids, quercetin, myricetin and scutellarein specifically inhibited Bap-mediated biofilm formation of S. aureus and other staphylococcal species. By using in vitro aggregation assays and the cell-based methodology for generation of amyloid aggregates based on the Curli-Dependent Amyloid Generator system (C-DAG), we demonstrated that these polyphenols prevented the assembly of Bap-related amyloid-like structures. Finally, using an in vivo catheter infection model, we showed that quercetin and myricetin significantly reduced catheter colonization by S. aureus. These results support the use of polyphenols as anti-amyloids molecules that can be used to treat biofilm-related infections.","Matilla-Cuenca, Leticia; Gil, Carmen; Cuesta, Sergio; Rapún-Araiz, Beatriz; Žiemytė, Miglė; Mira, Alex; Lasa, Iñigo; Valle, Jaione",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7641273/,247

Trypanosoma vivax is mainly transmitted by tsetse flies; however, the parasite has also acquired the ability to be transmitted mechanically by hematophagous dipterans. Understanding its distribution, host range and prevalence is a key step in local and global efforts to control the disease. METHODS: The study was conducted according to the methodological recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. A systematic literature search was conducted on three search engines, namely PubMed, Scopus and CAB Direct, to identify all publications reporting natural infection of T. vivax across the world. All the three search engines were screened using the search term Trypanosoma vivax without time and language restrictions. Publications on T. vivax that met our inclusion criteria were considered for systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULT: The study provides a global database of T. vivax, consisting of 899 records from 245 peer-reviewed articles in 41 countries. A total of 232, 6277 tests were performed on 97 different mammalian hosts, including a wide range of wild animals. Natural infections of T. vivax were recorded in 39 different African and Latin American countries and 47 mammalian host species. All the 245 articles were included into the qualitative analysis, while information from 186 cross-sectional studies was used in the quantitative analysis mainly to estimate the pooled prevalence. Pooled prevalence estimates of T. vivax in domestic buffalo, cattle, dog, dromedary camel, equine, pig, small ruminant and wild animals were 30.6%, 6.4%, 2.6%, 8.4%, 3.7%, 5.5%, 3.8% and 12.9%, respectively. Stratified according to the diagnostic method, the highest pooled prevalences were found with serological techniques in domesticated buffalo (57.6%) followed by equine (50.0%) and wild animals (49.3%). CONCLUSION: The study provides a comprehensive dataset on the geographical distribution and host range of T. vivax and demonstrates the potential of this parasite to invade other countries out of Africa and Latin America.

Three radiologists, blinded to other results, interpreted all studies using both lexicons with documentation of applicability and preferred score in assessing every case. The purpose of the study is to assess COVID-19 standardized assessment schemes’ (CO-RADS and COVID-RADS lexicons) applicability and diagnostic efficacy. RESULTS: This study included 991 RT-PCR-confirmed CT studies. An almost perfect agreement was found in COVID-RADS among the three observers (Fleiss Kappa = 0.82), opposed by a substantial agreement in CO-RADS (Κ = 0.78). The preference records favor COVID-RADS/CO-RADS in 78.5%/12.5%, 75.5%/24.5%, and 73.4%/24.5% regarding the three radiologists’ records, respectively. The distinguishability between positive and negative RT-PCR cases was 0.92 for COVID-RADS, while it was 0.85 for CO-RADS. On the other hand, both lexicons’ performance regarding clinical diagnosis and clinical suspicion index was 0.93 for COVID-RADS and 0.94 for CO-RADS. A very high to excellent agreement between the three observers for COVID-RADS/CO-RADS preference was concluded (Fleiss Kappa = 0.80 to 0.94). These results were statistically significant (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Both lexicon scores (CO-RADS and COVID-RADS) were found to be applicable in the COVID-19 structured report with the preference of COVID-RADS in more than 50% of cases.

Estimated GDP and food price changes are then used as inputs into the International Food Security Assessment (IFSA) model which estimates changes in food consumption, and food gaps in developing countries. Results indicate that the COVID-19 lockdowns lead to a decrease in global GDP of 7.2 per cent, and a decrease in grain prices of 9 per cent. These changes lead to an increase in the number of food-insecure people in 2020 of 211 million (a 27.8 per cent increase).

Data from 56 non-hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection referred to our nuclear medicine department from July–December 2020 for a perfusion only SPECT/CT study or a ventilation perfusion SPECT/CT study were collected. Images were assessed for the presence and type of perfusion defects. The CT component of the study was also assessed for the presence of mosaic attenuation and COVID pneumonia changes. RESULTS: Thirty-two (57.1%) cases had perfusion defects. There were 20 (35.7%) cases with defects in keeping with pulmonary embolism, 17 (30.4%) cases with defects associated with mosaic attenuation but not due to pulmonary embolism, and 6 (10.7%) of cases with defects due to pulmonary infiltrates from COVID pneumonia. A total of 24 (42.9%) cases had mosaic attenuation on CT, with 10 (17.9%) of them showing a pattern likely consistent with shunting on the perfusion images. CONCLUSION: Lung perfusion abnormalities are a common finding in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild disease. They are usually either due to pulmonary embolism, parenchymal infiltrates, or other causes of mosaic attenuation related to, but not specific to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. The value of VQ SPECT/CT imaging is also shown in this study, in detecting and differentiating the various types of perfusion abnormalities.","Evbuomwan, Osayande; Engelbrecht, Gerrit; Bergman, Melissa V.; Mokwena, Sello; Ayeni, Oluwatosin A.",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8188766/,247
55039,A bioinformatics approach to investigating the structural and functional consequences of SNPs in TMPRSS2 for COVID‐19 infection,2021-05-14,"Rabies virus (RABV) induces acute, fatal encephalitis in mammals including humans. The circRNAs are important in virus infection process, but whether circRNAs regulated RABV infection remains largely unknown. Here, mice brain with or without the RABV CVS-11 strain were subjected to RNA sequencing and a total of 30,985 circRNAs were obtained. Among these, 9021 candidates were shared in both groups, and 14,610 and 7354 circRNAs were expressed specifically to the control and experimental groups, indicating that certain circRNAs were specifically inhibited or induced on RABV infection. The circRNAs mainly derived from coding exons. In total, 636 circRNAs were differentially expressed in RABV infection, of which 426 significantly upregulated and 210 significantly downregulated (p < 0.05 and fold change ≥2). The expression of randomly selected 6 upregulated and 6 downregulated circRNAs was tested by RT-qPCR, and the expression trend of the 11 out of 12 circRNAs was consistent in RT- qPCR and RNA-seq analysis. Rnase R-resistant assay and Sanger sequencing were conducted to verify the circularity of circRNAs. GO analysis demonstrated that source genes of all differentially regulated circRNAs were mainly related to cell plasticity and synapse function. Both KEGG and GSEA analysis revealed that these source genes were engaged in the cGMP–PKG and MAPK signaling pathway, and HTLV-I infection. Also, pathways related to glucose metabolism and synaptic functions were enriched in KEGG analysis. The circRNA–miRNA–mRNA network was built with 25 of 636 differentially expressed circRNAs, 264 mRNAs involved in RABV infection, and 29 miRNAs. Several miRNAs and many mRNAs in the network were reported to be related to viral infection and the immune response, suggesting that circRNAs could regulate RABV infection via interacting with miRNAs and mRNAs. Taken together, this study first characterized the transcriptomic pattern of circRNAs, and signaling pathways and function that circRNAs are involved in, which may indicate directions for further research to understand mechanisms of RABV pathogenesis.","Zhao, Wen; Su, Jingyin; Wang, Ningning; Zhao, Naiyu; Su, Shuo",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8234020/,247

Due to widespread pollution with untreated sewage, concerns have been raised over water quality in Lebanon, a country with well-documented challenges in infrastructure. Here, we evaluated the water quality of major rivers in Lebanon by quantifying the densities of fecal indicator bacteria (fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli). Additionally, we assessed the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant E. coli in river water. Composite water samples (n = 132) were collected from fourteen rivers, and 378 E. coli were isolated and analyzed. Fecal coliforms and E. coli were detected in 96.29% and 95.5% of the samples, respectively. Additionally, 73.48–61.3% and 31.81% of the samples exceeded the microbiological acceptability standards for irrigation and the fecal coliform limit for recreational activities, respectively.

59549,Tinnitus following COVID-19 vaccination: report of three cases.,2021-06-13,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The PED is a new endoluminal construct designed to exclude aneurysms from the parent cerebrovasculature. We report the very late (>1 year) thrombosis of PED constructs in 2 patients. RESULTS Two patients with very large fusiform basilar trunk aneurysms underwent parent artery reconstruction with the PED. Both patients were maintained on dual antiplatelet therapy throughout the first year following treatment. Follow-up conventional angiography, performed 12 months after treatment, demonstrated, in both patients, thrombosis of most of the aneurysm with minimal residual flow through the construct and into the aneurysm fundus. In response to the residual filling, clopidogrel was discontinued (aspirin therapy was maintained). Both patients presented with symptomatic acute occlusions of the PED constructs within 14 days of clopidogrel discontinuation. DISCUSSION Patient 1 presented with constitutional symptoms that progressed to severe headache without other neurologic signs or symptoms. Occlusion of the PED construct was confirmed with conventional angiography. MR imaging demonstrated no evidence of infarction or parenchymal injury. The headaches were managed successfully with steroid therapy. Patient 2 presented with a syndrome of acute basilar occlusion with brain stem stroke. Complete occlusion was confirmed on angiography. Emergent thrombolysis with mechanical revascularization was performed successfully; however, the patient ultimately succumbed to the infarction. CONCLUSIONS It appears that flow-diverting constructs built across large circumferential aneurysms may remain thrombogenic for much longer than conventional intracranial or peripheral bare metal stents.

60656,"Children and adolescents cancer incidence, mortality and survival a population-based study in Midwest of Brazil.",2020-08-17,"BACKGROUND & AIMS The impact of dairy consumption on breast cancer development is unclear. We sought to examine associations between long-term consumption of milk and fermented dairy products and risk of breast cancer by estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status and assess whether these associations varied by body weight. METHODS The population-based Swedish Mammography Cohort included 33,780 women (88.2% postmenopausal), with no history of cancer or diabetes at baseline (1997). Long-term consumption of dairy products was assessed using a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire in 1987 and 1997. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS During 16.6 years of follow-up (559,286 person-years), 1870 total breast cancer cases were diagnosed (1162 ER+/PR+; 195 ER-/PR-). High long-term non-fermented milk consumption was associated with increased ER+/PR+ breast cancer incidence, HR = 1.30, 95%CI:1.02-1.65 for the average of 1987 and 1997 intake ≥2 vs. 0 servings/day and this increased risk was limited to women with BMI<25 kg/m2 HR = 1.55, 95%CI:1.08-2.21, while no significant associations with milk consumption were observed with ER-/PR- breast cancer. In contrast, consumption of fermented dairy products was inversely associated with ER-/PR- breast cancer (for consistently high intake ≥3 vs. <1 servings/day HR = 0.28, 95%CI:0.10-0.78), but not clear association was observed for ER+/PR+ (HR = 0.89, 95%CI:0.69-1.14). CONCLUSIONS In this cohort of mainly postmenopausal women, high long-term consumption of milk was associated with increased risk of ER+/PR+ breast cancer. In contrast, high long-term consumption of fermented dairy products was associated with decreased risk of ER-/PR- breast cancer.","Kaluza, Joanna; Komatsu, Shoko; Lauriola, Mara; Harris, Holly R; Bergkvist, Leif; Michaëlsson, Karl; Wolk, Alicja",Clinical nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.09.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004231/,247
60732,Maternal Circulating Vitamin Status and Colostrum Vitamin Composition in Healthy Lactating Women-A Systematic Approach.,2018,"BACKGROUND: Poor psychosocial work environments are considered critical factors of nurses' intention to leave their profession. Workplace injustice has been proven to increase the incidence of psychiatric morbidity among workers. However, few studies have directly investigated the effect of workplace justice on nurses' intention to leave their profession and the population attributable risk among nurses. OBJECTIVE: This study identified factors associated with workplace justice and nurses' intention to leave the profession. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Approximately 10% of all secondary referral centers in Taiwan were stratified and randomly sampled. Multiple logistic regression and population attributable risks were preformed to assess the effect of workplace justice on nurses' intention to leave the nursing profession. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study was approved by the Research and Ethical Committee of National Taiwan University Hospital. Only nurses who consented to the study participated in the survey. RESULT: A total of 2268 nurses were recruited, of whom 1417 (62.5%) satisfactorily completed the questionnaire. The participants were classified and 342 (24.1%) of them were placed into the low workplace justice group. Nurses with low workplace justice had a higher intention of leaving the profession (adjusted odds ratio = 1.34, 95% confidence interval = 1.02-1.77). ""Employees' opinions are influential in hospital's decision making"" and ""employees' performance is evaluated fairly"" were the most influential factors of the participants' intention to quit. The adjusted population attributable risk was 3.7% for low workplace justice. CONCLUSION: This study has identified that workplace justice is a protective factor of nurses' leaving their current profession. A fair performance appraisal system and increased autonomy at work are warranted to dissuade nurses from leaving the nursing profession.","Chin, Weishan; Guo, Yue-Liang Leon; Hung, Yu-Ju; Hsieh, Yueh-Tzu; Wang, Li-Jie; Shiao, Judith Shu-Chu",Nursing ethics,https://doi.org/10.1177/0969733016687160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28095760/,247

MIS-C presents with symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). We aimed to better understand this cytokine storm syndrome by comparing the initial laboratory findings of MIS-C and MAS. METHODS Patients who were diagnosed with MAS due to systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis in our clinic between March 2002 and November 2020 and with MIS-C between 20 September and 20 October 2020 were enrolled into the study. The medical files of all patients were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS A total of 13 MAS (9 boys, 4 girls) and 26 MIS-C (16 boys,10 girls) patients were included in the study. Hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, fibrinogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels showed significant differences between the two groups (P < 0.05). Patients with MAS had lower hemoglobin (10.10 g/dL) and fibrinogen (2.72 g/dL), but higher ferritin (17 863 mg/dL) and LDH (890.61 U/L) at the time of diagnosis. Patients with MIS-C had higher absolute neutrophil count (12 180/mm3 ) and CRP (194.23 mg/dL) values, but lower absolute lymphocyte count (1140/mm3 ) at the time of diagnosis. Left ventricle ejection fraction was significantly lower in the MIS-C group in echocardiographic evaluation (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Ferritin, hemoglobin, LDH, and fibrinogen levels were significantly changed in MAS compared with MIS-C. However, patients with MIS-C have more severe signs than MAS, such as cardiac involvement.","Aydın, Fatma; Çelikel, Elif; Ekici Tekin, Zahide; Coşkun, Serkan; Sezer, Müge; Karagöl, Cüneyt; Kaplan, Melike Mehveş; Tekgöz, Nilüfer; Kurt, Tuba; Özcan, Serhan; Kavurt, Ahmet Vedat; Özkaya Parlakay, Aslınur; Çelikel Acar, Banu",International journal of rheumatic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-185x.14078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33550678/,247

Dermatologists and immunologists have to choose appropriate treatment strategy taking into consideration risk of infection and possible exacerbation of the course of the disease in patients with confirmed infection. Management of atopic dermatitis (AD) in moderate to severe cases is based on systemic therapy such as cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate and dupilumab. Areas covered: A literature search in PubMed database was performed until 6 March 2021. In this review, the authors discuss non-biologic and biologic systemic medications for AD and provide an overview of therapeutic recommendations during COVID-19 pandemic. EXPERT OPINION In case of an active COVID-19 infection, conventional systemic treatment and biological treatment needs to be stopped until clinical recovery. Noninfected patients with systemic treatment of AD should continue their therapy via self-application. The authors can conclude that understanding of dupilumab therapy is better recognized in context AD treatment during COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to cyclosporine, azathioprine and methotrexate.

We evaluated the safety and therapeutic effects of DP-b99 in patients with acute hemispheric ischemic stroke. METHODS The Membrane-Activated Chelator Stroke Intervention trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group trial of intravenous DP-b99 administered for 4 consecutive days (NCT00893867). Acute ischemic stroke patients within 9 hours of onset, but untreated by alteplase, with a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 10 to 16, and evidence of language dysfunction, visual field defect, and neglect were eligible. The primary efficacy analysis compared distributions of functional status measured by modified Rankin score in the intent-to-treat population of patients with any post-treatment outcome, adjusted for initial severity. Functional and neurological recovery were secondary measures. Home time was an exploratory end point. RESULTS Enrollment terminated at n=446 after the planned interim analysis determined futility; follow-up continued. Final modified Rankin score distributions were equal between DP-b99 and placebo-treated groups (P=0.10; P(adj) adjusted for baseline age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale=0.21). Fewer patients recovered to modified Rankin score ≤1 in the DP-b99-treated group (45/218; 20.6%) than after placebo (63/219; 28.8%) (P=0.05; P(adj)=0.10). Similarly, fewer patients attained National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≤1 after DP-b99 (42/218; 19.3%) than placebo (56/219; 25.6%; P=0.10; P(adj)=0.26). Mortality was similar between DP-b99 and placebo intent-to-treat groups (36/218; 16.5% vs 33/219; 15.1%; P=0.68). Home time was unchanged by treatment (median 36 vs 36.5 days; P=0.25). CONCLUSIONS Despite encouraging preclinical and phase II trial data, DP-b99 shows no evidence of efficacy in treating human ischemic stroke.","Lees, Kennedy R; Bornstein, Natan; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Gorelick, Philip B; Rosenberg, Gilad; Shuaib, Ashfaq",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.111.000013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23391764/,247
63931,Triglyceride-glucose index (TyG index) is a predictor of incident colorectal cancer: a population-based longitudinal study.,2020-07-24,"The rapid adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) systems has made clinical data available in electronic format for research and for many downstream applications. Electronic screening of potentially eligible patients using these clinical databases for clinical trials is a critical need to improve trial recruitment efficiency. Nevertheless, manually translating free-text eligibility criteria into database queries is labor intensive and inefficient. To facilitate automated screening, free-text eligibility criteria must be structured and coded into a computable format using controlled vocabularies. Named entity recognition (NER) is thus an important first step. In this study, we evaluate 4 state-of-the-art transformer-based NER models on two publicly available annotated corpora of eligibility criteria released by Columbia University (i.e., the Chia data) and Facebook Research (i.e.the FRD data). Four transformer-based models (i.e., BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA) pretrained with general English domain corpora vs. those pretrained with PubMed citations, clinical notes from the MIMIC-III dataset and eligibility criteria extracted from all the clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov were compared. Experimental results show that RoBERTa pretrained with MIMIC-III clinical notes and eligibility criteria yielded the highest strict and relaxed F-scores in both the Chia data (i.e., 0.658/0.798) and the FRD data (i.e., 0.785/0.916). With promising NER results, further investigations on building a reliable natural language processing (NLP)-assisted pipeline for automated electronic screening are needed.","Tian, Shubo; Erdengasileng, Arslan; Yang, Xi; Guo, Yi; Wu, Yonghui; Zhang, Jinfeng; Bian, Jiang; He, Zhe","ACM-BCB ... ... : the ...

In the current study, we aimed to explore the preferences of influenza vaccination among the Chinese elderly. A discrete choice experiment design was performed to assess their preferences toward five influenza vaccination attributes, including vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, severe adverse effects, vaccination cost, and vaccination recommendation source. A total of 144 participants aged over 60 years from three cities of Shaanxi province in China were surveyed. A mixed logit model was employed to analyze the data. The elderly population were found to prefer influenza vaccination with a longer duration of protection, followed by lower severe adverse effects, higher vaccine effectiveness, and recommended by healthcare providers. The vaccination cost was the least important attribute. The most considerable marginal willingness to pay for vaccination (CNY220.90) and the highest vaccination choice probability (83.70%) occurred when the duration of protection extended from 3 to 12 months. The present study's findings would inform decision-makers on implementing appropriate interventions for the increase of influenza vaccination coverage among the elderly in China.","Jiang, Minghuan; Li, Pengchao; Yao, Xuelin; Hayat, Khezar; Gong, Yilin; Zhu, Shan; Peng, Jin; Shi, Xinke; Pu, Zhaojing; Huang, Yifan; Fang, Yu",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1913029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33950797/,247

The aim of this study was to assess postgastrectomy syndrome and QOL after LAPPG as compared with laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy with Billroth-I reconstruction (LADGBI). METHODS Postgastrectomy Syndrome Assessment Scale-45 (PGSAS-45) questionnaires were sent by mail to 167 patients. To balance the characteristics of the groups, propensity score matching was performed. RESULTS Of the 167 patients sent questionnaires, 112 (67%) responded, including 47 who underwent LAPPG and 65 who underwent LADGBI. After propensity score matching, the LAPPG group scored significantly better on the diarrhea and dumping subscales. Multiple regression analysis showed that female sex and LADGBI were independent factors predicting dumping. Evaluation of outcome measures for singular symptom showed that the LAPPG group scored significantly worse on the acid regurgitation subscale, but significantly better on the lower abdominal pain and early dumping abdominal subscales. CONCLUSION LAPPG is superior to LADGBI for ameliorating postgastrectomy syndrome and maintaining QOL. LAPPG is recommended for patients with cT1N0 middle third gastric cancer.","Hosoda, Kei; Yamashita, Keishi; Sakuramoto, Shinichi; Katada, Natsuya; Moriya, Hiromitsu; Mieno, Hiroaki; Watanabe, Masahiko",American journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2016.09.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27751530/,247

65182,Graduated compression stockings for the prevention of postoperative venous thromboembolism in obstetric patients: a best practice implementation project.,2012,"Pulmonary lobe segmentation in computed tomography scans is essential for regional assessment of pulmonary diseases. Recent works based on convolution neural networks have achieved good performance for this task. However, they are still limited in capturing structured relationships due to the nature of convolution. The shape of the pulmonary lobes affect each other and their borders relate to the appearance of other structures, such as vessels, airways, and the pleural wall. We argue that such structural relationships play a critical role in the accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes when the lungs are affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD. In this paper, we propose a relational approach (RTSU-Net) that leverages structured relationships by introducing a novel non-local neural network module. The proposed module learns both visual and geometric relationships among all convolution features to produce self-attention weights. With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we initially train and validate RTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation). Using models pre-trained on COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate RTSU-Net on 470 COVID-19 suspects (370 for retraining and 100 for evaluation). Experimental results show that RTSU-Net outperforms three baselines and performs robustly on cases with severe lung infection due to COVID-19.","Xie, Weiyi; Jacobs, Colin; Charbonnier, Jean-Paul; van Ginneken, Bram",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2020.2995108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32730216/,247

65393,Improving gas exchange and exercise tolerance in mild COPD patients.,2021-02-12,"BACKGROUND Most non-coding RNA families exert their function by means of a conserved, common secondary structure. The Rfam data base contains more than five hundred structurally annotated RNA families. Unfortunately, searching for new family members using covariance models (CMs) is very time consuming. Filtering approaches that use the sequence conservation to reduce the number of CM searches, are fast, but it is unknown to which sacrifice. RESULTS We present a new filtering approach, which exploits the family specific secondary structure and significantly reduces the number of CM searches. The filter eliminates approximately 85% of the queries and discards only 2.6% true positives when evaluating Rfam against itself. First results also capture previously undetected non-coding RNAs in a recent human RNAz screen. CONCLUSION The RNA shape index filter (RNAsifter) is based on the following rationale: An RNA family is characterised by structure, much more succinctly than by sequence content. Structures of individual family members, which naturally have different length and sequence composition, may exhibit structural variation in detail, but overall, they have a common shape in a more abstract sense. Given a fixed release of the Rfam data base, we can compute these abstract shapes for all families. This is called a shape index. If a query sequence belongs to a certain family, it must be able to fold into the family shape with reasonable free energy. Therefore, rather than matching the query against all families in the data base, we can first (and quickly) compute its feasible shape(s), and use the shape index to access only those families where a good match is possible due to a common shape with the query.","Janssen, Stefan; Reeder, Jens; Giegerich, Robert",BMC bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18312625/,247

This is mainly caused by the adult human heart lacking the ability to regenerate upon injury, whereas zebrafish have the capacity through cardiomyocyte proliferation to fully regenerate the heart following injury such as apex resection (AR). But a systematic overview of the methods used to evidence heart regrowth and regeneration in the zebrafish is lacking. Herein, we conducted a systematical search in Embase and Pubmed for studies on heart regeneration in the zebrafish following injury and identified 47 AR studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Overall, three different methods were used to assess heart regeneration in zebrafish AR hearts. 45 out of 47 studies performed qualitative (37) and quantitative (8) histology, whereas immunohistochemistry for various cell cycle markers combined with cardiomyocyte specific proteins was used in 34 out of 47 studies to determine cardiomyocyte proliferation qualitatively (6 studies) or quantitatively (28 studies). For both methods, analysis was based on selected heart sections and not the whole heart, which may bias interpretations. Likewise, interstudy comparison of reported cardiomyocyte proliferation indexes seems complicated by distinct study designs and reporting manners. Finally, six studies performed functional analysis to determine heart function, a hallmark of human heart injury after MI. In conclusion, our data implies that future studies should consider more quantitative methods eventually taking the 3D of the zebrafish heart into consideration when evidencing myocardial regrowth after AR. Furthermore, standardized guidelines for reporting cardiomyocyte proliferation and sham surgery details may be considered to enable inter study comparisons and robustly determine the effect of given genes on the process of heart regeneration.","Juul Belling, Helene; Hofmeister, Wolfgang; Andersen, Ditte Caroline",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9030548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32111059/,247

SUMMARY The COVID-19 pandemic caused a nationwide disruption of APPE pharmacy education. Healthcare institutions faced the challenge of educating APPE students while attempting to simultaneously de-densify work areas and reduce transmission risk for employees and patients. A pharmacist coordinator and pharmacist academic partners at a large teaching hospital created a collaborative common core curriculum model for resourceful implementation of APPE education. Healthcare network pharmacists, clinical pharmacist academic partners, and pharmacy residents delivered the curriculum to 35 pharmacy students over a 9-week time period. Main components of the curriculum included patient case discussions, topic discussions, journal club presentations, live continuing education (CE) webinars, and development of pharmacy technician CE programs.

69148,Ultrasound assessment of subglottic region for estimation of appropriate endotracheal tube size in pediatric anesthesia.,2017,"We report a structure-based biological approach to identify the proton-transfer pathway in photosystem II. First, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to analyze the H-bond network that may serve as a Grotthuss-like proton conduit. MD simulations show that D1-Asp61, the H-bond acceptor of H2O at the Mn4CaO5 cluster (W1), forms an H-bond via one water molecule with D1-Glu65 but not with D2-Glu312. Then, D1-Asp61, D1-Glu65, D2-Glu312, and the adjacent residues, D1-Arg334, D2-Glu302, and D1-Glu323, were thoroughly mutated to the other 19 residues, i.e., 114 Chlamydomonas chloroplast mutant cells were generated. Mutation of D1-Asp61 was most crucial. Only the D61E and D61C cells grew photoautotrophically and exhibit O2-evolving activity. Mutations of D2-Glu312 were less crucial to photosynthetic growth than mutations of D1-Glu65. Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations indicated that in the PSII crystal structure, the proton is predominantly localized at D1-Glu65 along the H-bond with D2-Glu312, i.e., pKa(D1-Glu65) > pKa(D2-Glu312). The potential-energy profile shows that the release of the proton from D1-Glu65 leads to the formation of the two short H-bonds between D1-Asp61 and D1-Glu65, which facilitates downhill proton transfer along the Grotthuss-like proton conduit in the S2 to S3 transition. However, inhibitions of photosynthetic growth were absent in the E65K and E65H mutants. It seems possible that D1-Glu65 is involved in the dominant pathway that proceeds from W1 via D1-Asp61 toward the thylakoid lumen, whereas D2-Glu312 and D1-Arg334 are used as alternative pathways in some mutants.","Kuroda, Hiroshi; Kawashima, Keisuke; Ueda, Kazuyo; Ikeda, Takuya; Saito, Keisuke; Ninomiya, Ryo; Hida, Chisato; Takahashi, Yuichiro; Ishikita, Hiroshi",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

69229,Persistence with osteoporosis treatment in patients from the Lille University Hospital Fracture Liaison Service.,2020-12-29,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging human pathogen that is the causative agent for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). With MERS outbreaks resulting in over 35% fatalities and now spread to 27 countries, MERS-CoV poses a significant ongoing threat to global human health. As part of its viral genome, MERS-CoV encodes a papain-like protease (PLpro) that has been observed to act as a deubiquitinase and deISGylase to antagonize type I interferon (IFN-I) immune pathways. This activity is in addition to its viral polypeptide cleavage function. Although the overall impact of MERS-CoV PLpro function is observed to be essential, difficulty has been encountered in delineating the importance of its separate functions, particularly its deISGylase activity. As a result, the interface of MERS-CoV and human interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (hISG15) was probed with isothermal calorimetry, which suggests that the C-terminal domain of hISG15 is principally responsible for interactions. Subsequently, the structure of MERS-CoV PLpro was solved to 2.4 Å in complex with the C-terminal domain of hISG15. Utilizing this structural information, mutants were generated that lacked appreciable deISGylase activity but retained wild-type deubiquitinase and peptide cleavage activities. Hence, this provides a new platform for understanding viral deISGylase activity within MERS-CoV and other CoVs.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), encode a papain-like protease (PLpro) that possesses the ability to antagonize interferon immune pathways through the removal of ubiquitin and interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) from target proteins. The lack of CoV proteases with attenuated deISGylase activity has been a key obstacle in delineating the impact between deubiquitinase and deISGylase activities on viral host evasion and pathogenesis. Here, biophysical techniques revealed that MERS-CoV PLpro chiefly engages human ISG15 through its C-terminal domain. The first structure of MERS-CoV PLpro in complex with this domain exposed the interface between these two entities. Employing these structural insights, mutations were employed to selectively remove deISGylase activity with no appreciable impact on its other deubiquitinase and peptide cleavage biochemical properties. Excitingly, this study introduces a new tool to probe the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and related viruses through the removal of viral deISGylase activity.","Daczkowski, Courtney M; Goodwin, Octavia Y; Dzimianski, John V; Farhat, Jonathan J; Pegan, Scott D",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01067-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28931677/,247

Although such models are often 'deterministic', these models suffer from a wide range of uncertainties. We argue that uncertainty quantification is crucial for computer model validation and reproducibility. We present a statistical framework, termed history matching, for performing global parameter search by comparing model output to the observed data. We employ Gaussian process (GP) emulators to produce fast predictions about model behaviour at the arbitrary input parameter settings allowing output uncertainty distributions to be calculated. History matching identifies sets of input parameters that give rise to acceptable matches between observed data and model output given our representation of uncertainties. Modellers could proceed by simulating computer models' outputs of interest at these identified parameter settings and producing a range of predictions. The variability in model results is crucial for inter-model comparison as well as model development. We illustrate the performance of emulation and history matching on a simple one-dimensional toy model and in application to a climate model.

The oxidative deamination produces several harmful side products like ammonia, peroxides, and aldehydes during the biochemical reaction. The concentration of biochemical neurotransmitter alteration in the brain by MAO is directly related with several neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD). Activated MAO also contributes to the amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation by two successive cleft β-secretase and γ-secretase of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Additionally, activated MAO is also involved in aggregation of neurofibrillary tangles and cognitive destruction through the cholinergic neuronal damage and disorder of the cholinergic system. MAO inhibition has general anti-Alzheimer's disease effect as a consequence of oxidative stress reduction prompted by MAO enzymes. In this review, we outlined and addressed recent understanding on MAO enzymes such as their structure, physiological function, catalytic mechanism, and possible therapeutic goals in AD.

Dogs were challenged with CPV 2c three weeks later. Clinical observations, body weight and rectal temperature measurements, blood samples for serology and white blood cell counts and faecal samples for virus excretion were collected. Control dogs remained seronegative until challenge; vaccinated dogs seroconverted and were positive for antibodies to CPV2 from day 21. Four days after challenge, clinical signs associated with parvovirus infection (vomiting, paroxysmal shivering, depression, loose stools) were observed in the control dogs. Both animals were withdrawn from the study for welfare reasons one day later. On day 47, leucopenia was observed in controls, with white blood cell counts less than 50 per cent prechallenge values.

The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requires early detection and monitoring, within a clinical environment for critical cases and remotely for mild cases, with a large spectrum of symptoms. The fear of contamination in clinical environments has led to a dramatic reduction in on-site referrals for routine care. There has also been a perceived need to continuously monitor non-severe COVID-19 patients, either from their quarantine site at home, or dedicated quarantine locations (e.g., hotels). In particular, facilitating contact tracing with proximity and location tracing apps was adopted in many countries very rapidly. Thus, the pandemic has driven incentives to innovate and enhance or create new routes for providing healthcare services at distance. In particular, this has created a dramatic impetus to find innovative ways to remotely and effectively monitor patient health status.

METHOD This is a cross-sectional observational study that was conducted on cancer patients in the internal medicine department at Jordan University Hospital, Amman, Jordan. During a period of six months, a convenience sample of cancer patients was recruited, and their medical records were reviewed to collect information regarding their demographics, clinical, and medication information. Also, patients' Best Possible Medication History (BPMH) was collected using different methods, and a comparison between patients' BPMH and their current medications was conducted where discrepancies were recognized. RESULTS Seventy-eight medical records were reviewed, with a total of 166 discrepancies identified. Of these, 110 discrepancies (66.3%) were unintentional. Exactly 67.9% of the study participants (n = 53) were found to have at least one unintentional discrepancy, with the most common type being omissions (n = 71, 65.1%,) and the second most common type being additions (n = 16, 14.7%). Most of the discrepancies ranged between low to moderate in severity. Fifty-six (33.7%) intentional undocumented discrepancies (documentation errors) were also identified. CONCLUSION This study revealed a high rate of medication discrepancies among hospitalized cancer patients, most commonly unintentional omissions. Nevertheless, undocumented intentional discrepancies can equally harm this critically ill population. So, do we need medication reconciliation in cancer patients? Yes. Cancer patients are critically ill, and therefore more effort should be paid towards implementing medication reconciliation services in their treatment plan.","Moghli, Maram Abu; Farha, Rana Abu; Hammour, Khawla Abu",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.1177/1078155220946388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32741239/,247

Severe lung injury with a reproducible deterioration of pulmonary gas exchange and hemodynamics can be induced in anesthetized pigs using repeated lung lavages with warmed 0.9% saline (50 ml/kg body weight). Including standard respiratory and hemodynamic monitoring with clinically applied devices in this model allows the evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies (drugs, modern ventilators, extracorporeal membrane oxygenators, ECMO), and bridges the gap between bench and bedside. Furthermore, induction of lung injury with lung lavages does not require the injection of pathogens/endotoxins that impact on measurements of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. A disadvantage of the model is the high recruitability of atelectatic lung tissue. Standardization of the model helps to avoid pitfalls, to ensure comparability between experiments, and to reduce the number of animals needed.","Russ, Martin; Kronfeldt, Sebastian; Boemke, Willehad; Busch, Thilo; Francis, Roland C E; Pickerodt, Philipp A",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/53610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27684585/,247

Despite years of research in this field, there is no effective licensed vaccine to prevent RSV infection. We have generated candidate RSV vaccines using a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) replicon in which the attachment and fusion domains of the VSV glycoprotein (G) have been deleted (rVSV-Gstem), rendering the virus propagation-defective except in the presence of complementing VSV G provided in trans. A form of this vector encoding the RSV fusion protein (F) gene expressed high levels of F in vitro and elicited durable neutralizing antibody responses as well as complete protection against RSV challenge in vivo. Mice vaccinated with rVSV-Gstem-RSV-F replicons also developed robust cellular responses characterized by both primary and memory Th1-biased CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, a single high dose of the Gstem-RSV-F replicon was effective against challenge with both RSV A and B subgroup viruses. Finally, addition of an RSV glycoprotein (G)-expressing Gstem vector significantly improved the incomplete protection achieved with a single low dose of Gstem-RSV-F vector alone.","Johnson, J Erik; McNeil, Lisa K; Megati, Shakuntala; Witko, Susan E; Roopchand, Vidia S; Obregon, Jennifer H; Illenberger, Deanne M; Kotash, Cheryl S; Nowak, Rebecca M; Braunstein, Emily; Yurgelonis, Irene; Jansen, Kathrin U; Kalyan, Narender K; Sidhu, Maninder K",Immunology letters,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2012.12.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23261719/,247

Of particular concern is the potential for significant respiratory, cardiovascular, physical, and psychological dysfunctions. AREAS COVERED In this context, the current review will focus on the following areas: 1) staying physically active during the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) highlighting the importance of understanding COVID-19 mechanisms; 3) preventing infections for healthcare workers by using personal protective equipment; 4) highlighting importance of respiratory care and physical therapy during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19; and 5) facilitating referral to a rehabilitation program in patients recovering from COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION We recommend daily physical exercise, outdoors or at home, as physical exercise increases the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines; Patients with COVID-19 may develop severe acute respiratory syndrome, hypoxemia, diffuse alveolar damage, ACE2 reduction in the cardiovascular system and muscle weakness acquired through a prolonged hospital stay; The role of the physiotherapist in the hospital environment is of fundamental importance-early mobilization is highly recommended in severe cases of COVID-19.","Goulart, Cássia da Luz; Silva, Rebeca Nunes; Oliveira, Murilo Rezende; Guizilini, Solange; Rocco, Isadora Salvador; Mendez, Vanessa Marques Ferreira; Bonjorno, José Carlos; Caruso, Flavia Rossi; Arena, Ross; Borghi-Silva, Audrey",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2021.1917994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852807/,247

Numerous products are available that claim to decrease postoperative scar formation and improve wound healing. These products attempt to create an ideal environment for wound healing by targeting the three phases of wound healing: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. With that said, preoperative interventions, such as lifestyle modifications and optimization of medical comorbidities, and intraoperative interventions, such as adherence to meticulous operative techniques, are equally important for ideal scarring. In this article, the authors review the available options in postoperative scar management, addressing the benefits of multimodal perioperative intervention. Although numerous treatments exist, no single modality has been proven superior over others. Therefore, each patient should receive a personalized treatment regimen to optimize scar management.","Commander, Sarah Jane; Chamata, Edward; Cox, Joshua; Dickey, Ryan M; Lee, Edward I",Seminars in plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0036-1584824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27478420/,247

Congenital syphilis can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or early infant death, and infected infants can experience lifelong physical and neurologic problems. Although timely identification and treatment of maternal syphilis during pregnancy can prevent congenital syphilis (1,2), the number of reported congenital syphilis cases in the United States increased 261% during 2013-2018, from 362 to 1,306. Among reported congenital syphilis cases during 2018, a total of 94 resulted in stillbirths or early infant deaths (3). Using 2018 national congenital syphilis surveillance data and a previously developed framework (4), CDC identified missed opportunities for congenital syphilis prevention. Nationally, the most commonly missed prevention opportunities were a lack of adequate maternal treatment despite the timely diagnosis of syphilis (30.7%) and a lack of timely prenatal care (28.2%), with variation by geographic region. Congenital syphilis prevention involves syphilis prevention for women and their partners and timely identification and treatment of pregnant women with syphilis. Preventing continued increases in congenital syphilis requires reducing barriers to family planning and prenatal care, ensuring syphilis screening at the first prenatal visit with rescreening at 28 weeks' gestation and at delivery, as indicated, and adequately treating pregnant women with syphilis (2). Congenital syphilis prevention strategies that implement tailored public health and health care interventions to address missed opportunities can have substantial public health impact.","Kimball, Anne; Torrone, Elizabeth; Miele, Kathryn; Bachmann, Laura; Thorpe, Phoebe; Weinstock, Hillard; Bowen, Virginia",MMWR.

79777,Diagnosis of Periprosthetic Joint Infection: The Potential of Next-Generation Sequencing.,2018,"In parallel with the recent world-wide promotion of One Health (OH) as a policy concept, a growing body of social science studies has raised questions about how successful OH policies and programs have been in managing some global health issues, such as zoonotic diseases. This paper briefly reviews this literature to clarify its critical perspective. Much of the literature on OH also is focused on health management at an international level and has paid less attention to implementation programs and policies for OH at the national and local levels, especially in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). Programs to implement OH often are linked to the concept of ""integration"", a notion that lacks a universal definition, but is nonetheless a central tenet and goal in many OH programs. At the local and national levels, strong differences in perspectives about OH among different professions can be major barriers to integration of those professions into OH implementation. Policies based on integration among professions in sectors like animal, human and environmental health can threaten professions' identities and thus may meet with resistance. Taking into account these criticisms of OH research and implementation, this paper proposes a research framework to probe the dominant social dimensions and power dynamics among professional participants that affect OH implementation programs at the local and national levels in a low-income country. The proposed research focus is the veterinary profession and one aspect of OH in which veterinarians are necessary actors: zoonotic disease management. Results from research framed in this way can have immediate application to the programs under study and can inform more expansive research on the social determinants of successful implementation of OH programs and policies.","Valeix, Sophie Françoise",Frontiers in veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2018.00085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29770324/,247

METHOD This prospective observational study included 217 patients that underwent surgical stripping (n = 62), radiofrequency ablation (n = 70), or cyanoacrylate embolization (n = 85) for the treatment of GSV insufficiency. Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) assessments were made, 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and Chronic Venous Insufficiency quality of life Questionnaire (CIVIQ-14) were administered, before and 1 year after the treatments. RESULTS Surgical stripping group had significantly higher closure rates than the other groups (p < 0.05). At 12 months, decrease in VCSS scores was less pronounced in the cyanoacrylate embolization group when compared to the other two groups (p < 0.05). Improvement in CIVIQ-14 scores was better in the radiofrequency ablation group when compared to the cyanoacrylate embolization group (p < 0.05). Surgical stripping or radiofrequency ablation groups performed better on several domains of SF-36, when compared to the cyanoacrylate embolization group. CONCLUSIONS Surgical stripping and radiofrequency ablation seem to provide a better quality of life results at one year in patients undergoing treatment for GSV insufficiency.","Ay, Yasin; Gunes, Esra; Turkkolu, Sevket Tuna; Selcuk, Emre; Calim, Muhittin; Akal, Ramazan; Aydin, Cemalettin; Inan, Bekir; Koksal, Cengiz; Kahraman Ay, Nuray",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355520947292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32741257/,247

Characteristics of commonly used knots have not been studied. OBJECTIVES To compare the modified transfixing and giant knots and the emasculator in open and closed equine castration techniques. STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo experiment. METHODS A total of 144 testicles were randomly assigned to 2 groups for open or closed castration. Both groups were divided into 3 subgroups of 18 specimens each: emasculator only, emasculator plus giant knot and emasculator plus transfixing knot and the open castration group also contained 2 further subgroups of 18 testicles each: giant knot only and transfixing knot only. The length of suture material used was measured for each knot and the leaking pressure of the testicular artery measured using dye injection. In the closed castration group, parietal tunic tensile strength was measured with a tensiometer. RESULTS Leaking pressure was higher in open compared with closed castration, with no significant difference among subgroups. In the closed castration group, minimum leaking pressure for the emasculator plus transfixing knot and emasculator only subgroups were close to standard physiological arterial pressures. The giant knot required less suture material than the transfixing knot. Parietal tunic tensile strength was higher when ligatures were applied. CONCLUSIONS The giant and transfixing knot techniques have comparable haemostatic capability and parietal tunic tensile strength, but the giant knot requires less suture material. In open castration, using the emasculator alone may produce adequate haemostasis. In closed castration, using the giant knot in combination with the emasculator increases the bursting pressure and possibly reduces the incidence of haemorrhage. In closed castration, application of a ligature may reduce the risk of evisceration.","Comino, F; Giusto, G; Caramello, V; Pagliara, E; Bellino, C; Gandini, M",Equine veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/evj.12546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26639302/,247

METHODS Open-payment-data for each provider including provider specialty, state of practice, industry payor, reason for payment, and amount was compiled for each transaction between 2013 and 2015. Total, mean, and median payment amounts per-provider were calculated for each specialty. Tukey's-method was used to identify and remove statistical outliers and Kruskal-Wallis-test with Bonferonni-post-hoc-analysis was used to evaluate for differences in total payments received per-provider across specialties. The percentage of providers accepting payments within each specialty were compared by Marascuilo's multiple-proportion-comparison. RESULTS Total aggregate payment amount (and number of transactions) for HO, SO, IR, and RO was $164 743 746 (778 007), $7 925 467 (15 031), $49 817 380 (44 939), and $13 643 739 (49 778), respectively. Corrected-median (and corrected-mean) payments-per-specialty were $676 ($1796), $330 ($1209), $487 ($1301), and $242 ($766). A significantly higher proportion of HO providers accepted payments than both RO (97% vs 80%, P < 0.0001) and IR (97% vs 78%, P < 0.0001). The mean total payment received per-provider differed significantly across specialties (P = 0.0001).

82196,Susceptibility to severe COVID-19.,2020-10-23,"The present review provides an overview of recent advances regarding the function of Th17 cells and their produced cytokines in the progression of viral diseases. Viral infections alone do not lead to virus-induced malignancies, as both genetic and host safety factors are also involved in the occurrence of malignancies. Acquired immune responses, through the differentiation of Th17 cells, form the novel components of the Th17 cell pathway when reacting with viral infections all the way from the beginning to its final stages. As a result, instead of inducing the right immune responses, these events lead to the suppression of the immune system. In fact, the responses from Th17 cells during persistent viral infections causes chronic inflammation through the production of IL-17 and other cytokines which provide a favorable environment for tumor growth and its development. Additionally, during the past decade, these cells have been understood to be involved in tumor progression and metastasis. However, further research is required to understand Th17 cells' immune mechanisms in the vast variety of viral diseases. This review aims to determine the roles and effects of the immune system, especially Th17 cells, in the progression of viral diseases; which can be highly beneficial for the diagnosis and treatment of these infections.","Aghbash, Parisa Shiri; Hemmat, Nima; Nahand, Javid Sadri; Shamekh, Ali; Memar, Mohammad Yousef; Babaei, Abouzar; Baghi, Hossein Bannazadeh",International immunopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33418239/,247

The spectrum of disease varies from asymptomatic to a severe form characterized by widespread thrombosis and multi-organ failure, termed catastrophic APS (CAPS). CAPS affects only about ∼1% of APS patients and often presents as a thrombotic microangiopathy and has a fulminant course with >40% mortality, despite the best available therapy. Animal models have previously implicated complement in the pathophysiology of thrombosis in APS, with more recent data from human studies confirming the interaction between the coagulation and complement pathways. Activation of the complement cascade via antiphospholipid antibodies can cause cellular injury and promote coagulation via multiple mechanisms. Finally, analogous to classic complement-mediated diseases such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, a subset of patients with APS may be at increased risk for development of CAPS due the presence of germline variants in genes crucial for complement regulation. Together, these data make complement inhibition an attractive and potentially life-saving therapy to mitigate morbidity and mortality in severe thrombotic APS and CAPS.","Chaturvedi, Shruti; Braunstein, Evan M; Brodsky, Robert A",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32881236/,247

However, the potential roles of BACE1 in insulin resistance and the risk of cognitive impairment in T2DM remain unclear. METHODS We measured plasma BACE1 levels, BACE1 cleavage activities for Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) and insulin receptor β subunit (INSR-β), and soluble INSR (sINSR) levels in a clinical cohort study. RESULTS T2DM patients with or without cognitive impairment exhibited elevated plasma BACE1 levels and BACE1 enzymatic activities for APPsw and INSR-β, and sINSR levels. Moreover, the glycemic status correlated with elevated BACE1 levels and BACE1-mediated INSR cleavage, which was associated with insulin resistance. DISCUSSION The elevated BACE1 levels in T2DM may contribute to increasing the cognitive impairment risk through both amyloidogenesis and insulin resistance.","Bao, Hong; Liu, Yiming; Zhang, Mengguo; Chen, Zuolong; Zhang, Weiwei; Ge, Yuhao; Kang, Dongmei; Gao, Feng; Shen, Yong",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.12276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33410588/,247

MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed 11 consecutive patients treated with scanning CIRT for localized prostate cancer in our hospital between December 2015 and January 2016. In-room CT images were taken under treatment conditions in every treatment session. The dose distribution on each in-room CT image was recalculated, while retaining the pencil beam arrangement of the initial treatment plan. Then, the dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters including the percentage of the clinical target volume (CTV) with 95% and 90% of the prescribed dose area (V95% of CTV, V90% of CTV) and V80% of rectum were calculated. The acceptance criteria for the CTV and rectum were set at V95% of CTV ≥95%, V90% of CTV ≥98%, and V80% of rectum < 10 ml. RESULTS V95% of CTV, V90% of CTV, and V80% of rectum for the reproduced plans were 98.8 ± 3.49%, 99.5 ± 2.15%, and 4.39 ± 3.96 ml, respectively. Acceptance of V95% of CTV, V90% of CTV, and V80% of rectum was obtained in 123 (94%), 125 (95%) and 117 sessions (89%), respectively.

SARS-CoV-2 transmission being responsible for the current pandemic, appears through airborne aerosols and droplets, thus, there has been an intense focus on such aerosol-generating procedures, and their reduction. Hence the objective of this systematic review was to evaluate available data on three major measures: rubber dam application, pre-procedural oral rinse, and high-volume evacuators (HVE) aimed at reducing bio-aerosols. METHOD PubMed via Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO host, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched between 01 January 1985 and 30 April 2020. RESULTS A total of 156 records in English literature were identified, and 17 clinical studies with 724 patients included in the final analysis. Eligible articles revealed the inadequacy of three principle approaches used in contemporary dental practice to minimize such bio-aerosols, rubber dam application, pre-procedural oral rinses, and HVE. The latter is an extremely effective method to reduce bio-aerosols in dentistry, although no single method can provide blanket cover. CONCLUSION Present systematic review indicates that employing combination strategies of rubber dam, with a pre-procedural antimicrobial oral rinse, and HVE may contain bio-aerosols during operative procedures.","Samaranayake, Lakshman Perera; Fakhruddin, Kausar Sadia; Buranawat, Borvornwut; Panduwawala, Chamila",Acta odontologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1080/00016357.2020.1839673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33307917/,247

PATIENTS AND METHODS In April 2020, we focused our attention on a young woman with diffused purpura on her lower extremities, with no respiratory, cardiac or neurological symptoms. A complete blood analysis showed us a severe thrombocytopenia. We excluded other possible causes of thrombocytopenic purpura such as hematological (lymphocyte subsets), hepatological disease or splenomegaly. On autoimmune screening, we found Isolated immune thrombocytopenic purpura in a young adult Covid-19 patient positivity of anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) with a centrosome pattern and extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) and connective tissue disease screen resulted positive but none of the included specific antigens results positive, probably due to an aspecific antibody reaction.

85388,Effects of the jaw-thrust manoeuvre in the semi-sitting position on securing a clear airway during fibreoptic intubation.,2015,"Most chronic and acute lung diseases have no cure, leaving lung transplantation as the only option. Recent work has improved our understanding of the endogenous regenerative capacity of the lung and has helped identification of different progenitor cell populations, as well as exploration into inducing endogenous regeneration through pharmaceutical or biological therapies. Additionally, alternative approaches that aim at replacing lung progenitor cells and their progeny through cell therapy, or whole lung tissue through bioengineering approaches, have gained increasing attention. Although impressive progress has been made, efforts at regenerating functional lung tissue are still ineffective. Chronic and acute lung diseases are most prevalent in the elderly and alterations in progenitor cells with ageing, along with an increased inflammatory milieu, present major roadblocks for regeneration. Multiple cellular mechanisms, such as cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction, are aberrantly regulated in the aged and diseased lung, which impairs regeneration. Existing as well as new human in vitro models are being developed, improved and adapted in order to study potential mechanisms of lung regeneration in different contexts. This review summarises recent advances in understanding endogenous as well as exogenous regeneration and the development of in vitro models for studying regenerative mechanisms.","Melo-Narváez, M Camila; Stegmayr, John; Wagner, Darcy E; Lehmann, Mareike",European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society,https://doi.org/10.1183/16000617.0222-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33060166/,247

Despite advances in pharmacological and device therapies for patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and heart failure (HFrEF), their quality of life (QoL) and exercise capacity are often persistently impaired, morbidity and mortality remain high and the health economic and societal costs are considerable. For patients with heart failure and preserved LVEF (HFpEF), diuretic management has an essential role for controlling congestion and symptoms even if no intervention has been convincingly shown to reduce morbidity or mortality. Remote monitoring might improve care delivery and clinical outcomes for patients regardless of LVEF. A great variety of innovative remote monitoring technologies and algorithms are being introduced, including patient self-managed testing, wearable either as integrated into established clinically indicated therapeutic devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, or as stand-alone are in development providing the promise of further improvements in service delivery and clinical outcomes. In this article, we will discuss unmet needs in the management of patients with HF, how remote monitoring might contribute to future solutions and provide an overview of current and novel remote monitoring technologies.","Bekfani, Tarek; Fudim, Marat; Cleland, John G F; Jorbenadze, Ana; von Haehling, Stephan; Lorber, Avraham; Rothman, Alexander M-K; Stein, Kenneth; Abraham, William T; Sievert, Horst; Anker, Stefan D",European journal of heart failure,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.2033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111389/,247

Loss of BLM activity leads to Bloom syndrome, which is characterized by extraordinary cancer risk and small stature. Here, we have analyzed the composition of the BLM complex during unperturbed S-phase and identified a direct physical interaction with the Mcm6 subunit of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex. Using distinct binding sites, BLM interacts with the N-terminal domain of Mcm6 in G1 phase and switches to the C-terminal Cdt1-binding domain of Mcm6 in S-phase, with a third site playing a role for Mcm6 binding after DNA damage. Disruption of Mcm6-binding to BLM in S-phase leads to supra-normal DNA replication speed in unperturbed cells, and the helicase activity of BLM is required for this increased replication speed. Upon disruption of BLM/Mcm6 interaction, repair of replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks is delayed and cells become hypersensitive to DNA damage and replication stress. Our findings reveal that BLM not only plays a role in the response to DNA damage and replication stress, but that its physical interaction with Mcm6 is required in unperturbed cells, most notably in S-phase as a negative regulator of replication speed.","Shastri, Vivek M; Subramanian, Veena; Schmidt, Kristina H",Nucleic acids research,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab663; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370039/,247

Rather than commit these fragile patients to two operations, we have done open gastric bypass as a definitive surgical treatment for extreme obesity. METHODS Office records of 61 patients with body mass index (BMI) of 70 and higher were reviewed. All underwent non-transectional open gastric bypass with a 150 cm Roux limb. Data included age, sex, weight, BMI, co-morbidities, operative information, length of stay (LOS), surgical morbidity, and percent excess weight loss (%XSWL). Data are in median (range). RESULTS There were 21 (34%) men and 40 (66%) women: age, 37 years (19-53); pre-operative weight, 468 lb (300-650); and pre-operative BMI, 77 (70-95). Co-morbidities were diabetes mellitus, 26 (46%); hypertension, 26 (43%); sleep apnea, 61 (100%); gastroesophageal reflux disease, 20 (33%); and hypothyroid nine (15%). Incision length was 15 cm (12-20), abdominal wall fat thickness was 8 cm (5-13), operative time was 150 min (100-210), and estimated blood loss was 100 ml (25-750); post-op intensive care unit: yes 16 (26%) and no 44 (74%). LOS was 3 days for 44 patients (74%), 4 days for 11 (18%), 5 days for five (8%), and 7 days for one (1.6%). Post-operative morbidity was as follows: zero mortality, splenectomy, stoma leak, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, GI bleeding, stomal ulcer, intestinal obstruction, fascial dehiscence, or 30-day readmission; wound infections in one (1.6%); skin wound separation in six (10%); pneumonia in one (1.6%); anemia in nine (14.8%); vitamin B(12) deficiency in six (10%); incisional hernia in 17 (28%); and gastric staple line disruption in two (3.3%). %XSWL were 51% in 1 year (28-84) and 60% in 2 years (27-97).

METHODS We sent a questionnaire on laparoscopic instruments, image documentation, preoperative evaluation, surgical indication, operative methods, and postoperative management to laparoscopic experts in Korea and Japan, and 24 (14 from Korea and 10 from Japan) responded. RESULTS Endoscopic ultrasound and preoperative endoscopy-guided clipping are routinely employed, respectively, by 14 (58%) and 20 (83%) of the surgeons. Surgeons perform laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) based on varying indications. Five surgeons (21%) performed LADG only for cases of stage T1 cancer, 15 (63%) performed LADG on patients with less than T2 lesions, and 4 (17%) performed LADG on patients with less than T3 lesions. With regard to postoperative anastomosis, 18 surgeons (75%) preferred extracorporeal anastomosis and 6 (25%) preferred intracorporeal anastomosis. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 6.5 days in Korea and 10.1 days in Japan (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION This survey can help to inform the current practice of laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery in Korea and Japan, where laparoscopic surgery is frequently performed.","Lee, H J; Shiraishi, N; Kim, H H; Hiki, N; Uyama, I; Choi, S H; Yang, H K; Kitano, S",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1758-5910.2011.00111.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22776335/,247

Although significant improvements in survival have occurred through the implementation of complex high-quality protocols of care, global costs related to such management are not clearly described. METHODS We will undertake a systematic review of the published literature on costs related to the acute phase of cardiac arrest management (from collapse to hospital discharge). The search will cover the period 1991 to present, and we will include studies written in English or in French involving patients with cardiac arrest of all ages, settings (in- and out-of-hospital arrest), countries, and etiology (including traumatic). The primary outcome will include estimates of costs related to cardiac arrest patients' management in various categories (e.g., resuscitation process, in-hospital management as well as rehabilitation and long-term care facilities) and perspectives (e.g., hospital, societal, or third-payer perspective). Study selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and data quality will be assessed by questions adapted from the Drummond economic evaluation checklist.

Globally, the impact of COVID-19 has been severe with more than half a million deaths over 6 months; in contrast, the HIV pandemic has resulted in over 32 million deaths worldwide over 40 years. This paper reviews the current epidemiology of COVID-19, summarizes its relationship to HIV, identifies synergies in our response, and suggests actions that can be taken to curtail the spread of COVID-19 among persons living with HIV (PLWH). Our understanding of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 has evolved rapidly as they did with HIV. Epidemiologically, there are similarities between the two viruses including asymptomatic spread, disproportionate impact on persons of color, need for rapid diagnostic testing, and lack of a cure or vaccine. PLWH do not appear generally to have an increased incidence of COVID-19 infection or a more severe course of disease. Clinical trials to identify potential treatment and prevention options for COVID-19 have included antiretrovirals used to treat HIV that have not been efficacious. Public health responses overlap between the two pandemics including the need for behavior change and containment strategies such as contact tracing. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic evolves, the path forward to controlling, preventing, and treating COVID-19 can be informed by lessons learned from HIV as we seek to control the spread of both viral pandemics.","Castel, Amanda D; Wilbourn, Brittany; Magnus, Manya; Greenberg, Alan E",AIDS reviews,https://doi.org/10.24875/aidsrev.20000070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33118529/,247

Yet, how SMC contribute to pathophysiology of atherosclerosis remains elusive. Methods: To reveal the trajectories of SMC transdifferentiation during atherosclerosis and to identify molecular targets for disease therapy, we combined SMC fate mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing of both mouse and human atherosclerotic plaques. We also performed cell biology experiments on isolated SMC-derived cells, conducted integrative human genomics, and employed pharmacological studies targeting SMC-derived cells both in vivo and in vitro. Results: We found that SMC transitioned to an intermediate cell state during atherosclerosis, which was also found in human atherosclerotic plaques of carotid and coronary arteries. SMC-derived intermediate cells, termed ""SEM"" cells, were multipotent and could differentiate into macrophage-like and fibrochondrocyte-like cells, as well as return towards SMC phenotype. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling was identified as a regulator of SMC to SEM cell transition and RA signaling was dysregulated in symptomatic human atherosclerosis. Human genomics revealed enrichment of genome wide association study (GWAS) signals for coronary artery disease (CAD) in RA signaling target gene loci and correlation between CAD risk alleles and repressed expression of these genes. Activation of RA signaling by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an anti-cancer drug for acute promyelocytic leukemia, blocked SMC transition to SEM cells, reduced atherosclerotic burden and promoted fibrous cap stability. Conclusions: Integration of cell-specific fate mapping, single-cell genomics and human genetics adds novel insights into the complexity of SMC biology and reveals regulatory pathways for therapeutic targeting of SMC transitions in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.","Pan, Huize; Xue, Chenyi; Auerbach, Benjamin J; Fan, Jiaxin; Bashore, Alexander C; Cui, Jian; Yang, Dina Y; Trignano, Sarah B; Liu, Wen; Shi, Jianting; Ihuegbu, Chinyere O; Bush, Erin C; Worley, Jeremy; Vlahos, Lukas; Laise, Pasquale; Solomon, Robert A; Connolly, Edward S; Califano, Andrea; Sims, Peter A; Zhang, Hanrui; Li, Mingyao; Reilly, Muredach P",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.120.048378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962412/,247

Using a drug combination screen reliant on synthetic lethal interactions, we identified clinically relevant combination therapies for different TNBC subtypes. Two drug combinations targeting the BET family were further explored. The first, targeting BET and CXCR2, is specific for mesenchymal TNBC and induces apoptosis, whereas the second, targeting BET and the proteasome, is effective for major TNBC subtypes and triggers ferroptosis. Ferroptosis was induced at low drug doses and was associated with increased cellular iron and decreased glutathione levels, concomitant with reduced levels of GPX4 and key glutathione biosynthesis genes. Further functional studies, analysis of clinical datasets and breast cancer specimens revealed a unique vulnerability of TNBC to ferroptosis inducers, enrichment of ferroptosis gene signature, and differential expression of key proteins that increase labile iron and decrease glutathione levels. This study identified potent combination therapies for TNBC and unveiled ferroptosis as a promising therapeutic strategy.","Verma, Nandini; Vinik, Yaron; Saroha, Ashish; Nair, Nishanth Ulhas; Ruppin, Eytan; Mills, Gordon; Karn, Thomas; Dubey, Vinay; Khera, Lohit; Raj, Harsha; Maina, Flavio; Lev, Sima",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba8968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937365/,247

95142,The Impact of Obesity on COVID-19 Disease Severity.,2020,"BACKGROUND Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is used to treat a variety of cancers. It exerts its mechanism of action by blocking the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). Toxicity concerns include immune-related toxicities, including colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, endocrine toxicities and more rarely, myocarditis and other organ system toxicities. OBJECTIVE To review a real-world case involving immunotherapy induced myocarditis after a patient received pembrolizumab and discuss how the current pandemic created complexity in toxicity management. DISCUSSION An 83 year old male with metastatic lung cancer developed fatal myocarditis after receiving 2 doses of pembrolizumab. Applying the Naranjo score, the likelihood of pembrolizumab causing the myocarditis is probable, with a score of 6. Severe cardiac toxicities are rare with pembrolizumab, but can still occur. It is vital to be aware of these toxicities, and educate patients on signs and symptoms. Complicating the situation even further was the global pandemic, which created fear and hesitation in the patient and the patient's family to seek medical treatment out of fear of exposure. This pandemic adds another layer to the complexity of care for patients with cancer and management of toxicities. Pharmacists play a significant role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of medications, especially oncology agents. CONCLUSION Proper education of patients regarding symptoms and when to report are paramount to assisting in early detection and intervention for immunotherapy-related adverse events.

95567,Nosocomial infections as one of the most important problems of healthcare system.,2021-09-16,"Hospital hygiene is of pivotal importance in radiology departments, where patient throughput is high and staff come into direct contact with both inpatients and outpatients. Every member of the medical and technical team should be aware of all the general and specific hygiene requirements and ensure that they are considered during the daily routine. Failure to do so on the part of just one individual can result in bacterial contamination in the department, exposing both patients and staff to the risk of infection. For the purposes of performing examinations and interventions in infectious patients, the hospital hygienist and medical hygiene officer should introduce appropriate organisational structures to ensure that an appropriate level of hygiene is guaranteed and can be adapted to each patient. This will ensure a minimal degree of disruption to work flow in the radiology department. It is of particular importance that medical and technical staff receive regular hygiene training and instruction. Such training ensures that members of staff are fully aware of the hygiene requirements, are responsibly engaged and that they each possess the expertise and confidence to deal with general and specific hygiene issues in any particular case.","Buerke, B; Mellmann, A; Kipp, F; Heindel, W; Weßling, J",RoFo : Fortschritte auf dem Gebiete der Rontgenstrahlen und der Nuklearmedizin,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1325444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23203446/,247

100463,COVID-19 Outbreak: Neurological Manifestations beyond Cough and Fever.,2020-11-20,"Traumatic events have been proposed to be associated with hypo-activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, but data in animal models exposed to severe stressors are controversial and have important methodological concerns. Individual differences in resting or stress levels of corticosterone might explain some of the inconsistencies. We then studied this issue in male rats exposed to 2 h immobilization on boards (IMO), a severe stressor. Thirty-six rats were blood sampled under resting conditions four times a day on three non-consecutive days. Then, they were assigned to control (n = 14) or IMO (n = 22) to study the HPA response to IMO, the stressor-induced alterations in the circadian pattern of corticosterone (CPCORT), and the behavioral and HPA responsiveness to an open-field. Individual differences in pre-IMO resting corticosterone were inconsistent, but averaging data markedly improved consistency. The CPCORT was markedly altered on day 1 post-IMO (higher trough and lower peak levels), less altered on day 3 and apparently normal on day 7. Importantly, when rats were classified in low and high resting corticosterone groups (LCORT and HCORT, respectively), on the basis of the area under the curve (AUC) of the averaged pre-IMO data, AUC differences between LCORT and HCORT groups were maintained in controls but disappeared in IMO rats during the post-IMO week. Open-field hypo-activity and corticosterone sensitization were similar in LCORT and HCORT groups nine days after IMO. A single IMO exposure causes long-lasting HPA alterations, some of them dependent on pre-stress resting corticosterone levels, with no evidence for post-IMO resting corticosterone hypo-activity.","Belda, Xavier; Fuentes, Silvia; Labad, Javier; Nadal, Roser; Armario, Antonio",Hormones and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2020.104865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991887/,247

We sought to investigate the changes in the parameters of consumption behaviors and appetite sensations induced by a mixed meal tolerance test, and to correlate these alterations with age, body mass index, C-peptide levels, and duration of T2D 1 year after bariatric surgery. METHODS A total of 16 obese patients with T2D who underwent mini-gastric bypass (GB) and 16 patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were enrolled in this study and evaluated using a mixed meal tolerance test one year after surgery. A visual analogue scale was used for scoring appetite sensation at different time points. The area under the curve (AUC) and the incremental or decremental AUC (ΔAUC) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS One year after surgery, a decreasing trend in the consumption time was observed in the GB group compared to the SG group, while the duration of T2D before surgery was negatively correlated with the post-operative consumed time in those after GB. Patients who underwent GB had significantly higher fasting scores for fullness and desire to eat, higher AUC0'-180' of scores for desire to eat, as well as more effective post-meal suppression of hunger and desire to eat compared with those undergoing SG one year after surgery. Post-operative C-peptide levels were negatively correlated with ΔAUC0'-180' for hunger and ΔAUC0'-180' for desire to eat in the GB group, while negatively correlated with ΔAUC0'-180' for fullness in the SG group. DISCUSSION Patients with T2D after either GB or SG exhibit distinct nutrient-induced consumption behaviors and appetite sensations post-operatively, which may account for the differential effects on weight loss and glycemic control after different surgery.","Yeh, Chun; Huang, Hsien-Hao; Chen, Shu-Chun; Chen, Tung-Fang; Ser, Kong-Han; Chen, Chih-Yen",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28344903/,247

Previous studies have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells via binding to angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). Methods To explore the expression of ACE2 and the potential risk of infection in testis, we performed a bioinformatic analysis based on public databases, and conducted a pilot study using a mouse model. We also collected clinical follow-up date on male patients who had recovered from COVID-19 for 6 months. Results The results showed that the RNA expression of ACE2 was higher in testis compared with other organs. Single-cell analysis and immunocytochemistry further indicated that Leydig cells were at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Green fluorescence was only detected in the Leydig cells after intratesticular injection of pseudovirus SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse model. In the clinical follow-up, serum total testosterone level was statistically lower in patients who had recovered from COVID-19 compared with healthy men (P=0.010). Conclusions The findings of the present study indicate the potential vulnerability of Leydig cells. It is important to monitor the reproductive system and its complications in male COVID-19 patients.

105163,A quantitative evaluation of aerosol generation during tracheal intubation and extubation: a reply.,2020-12-23,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of the Arteriviridae family of Nidovirales, is the causative agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, which results in enormous economic losses in the swine industry. As the second protein encoded by the PRRSV genome, nsp1beta cleaves itself from the downstream nsp2 protein via a C-terminal papain-like cysteine protease (PCP) domain. Although nsp1beta is known to be involved in virulence, its precise role in the process of viral infection remains unclear. In this work, we describe the homodimeric crystal structure of PRRSV nsp1beta in its natural, self-processed form. We show that the architecture of its N-terminal domain (NTD) adopts a fold closely resembling that of several known nucleases and has intrinsic nuclease activity that is strongly activated by manganese ions in vitro. Key features, however, distinguish nsp1beta from characterized nucleases, including the C-terminal PCP domain (which is responsible for the self-release of nsp1beta from nsp2), a linker domain (LKD) that connects the NTD and the PCP domain, and a C-terminal extension (CTE) that binds to and is stabilized by the putative substrate binding site of the PCPbeta domain. Combined with the reported nuclear localization of this protein, these results shed light on the self-processing mode and precise biological function of nsp1beta and thus offer a multitarget template for future drug discovery.","Xue, Fei; Sun, Yuna; Yan, Liming; Zhao, Cong; Chen, Ji; Bartlam, Mark; Li, Xuemei; Lou, Zhiyong; Rao, Zihe",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00301-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20410261/,247

The major cause of fatality in infected patients, now referred to as the ""Cytokine Storm Syndrome"" (CSS), is a direct result of aberrant immune activation following SARS-CoV2 infection and results in excess release of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and IL-6, by macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Single cell analysis has also shown significantly elevated levels of galectin 3 (Gal-3) in macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells in patients with severe COVID-19 as compared to mild disease. Inhibition of Gal-3 reduces the release of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α from macrophages in vitro, and as such may hold promise in reducing the incidence of CSS. In addition, Gal-3 inhibition shows promise in reducing transforming growth factor ß (TGF-ß) mediated pulmonary fibrosis, likely to be a major consequence in survivors of severe COVID-19. Finally, a key domain in the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 has been shown to bind N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a process that may be essential to cell entry by the virus. This Neu5Ac-binding domain shares striking morphological, sequence, and functional similarities with human Gal-3. Here we provide an updated review of the literature linking Gal-3 to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Dually targeting galectins and the Neu5Ac-binding domain of SARS-CoV2 shows tentative promise in several stages of the disease: preventing viral entry, modulating the host immune response, and reducing the post-infectious incidence of pulmonary fibrosis.","Caniglia, John L; Asuthkar, Swapna; Tsung, Andrew J; Guda, Maheedhara R; Velpula, Kiran K",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.25979.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33082935/,247

However, endoscopic resection (ER) has recently become a surgical alternative. The aim of this study was to compare survival outcomes between OR and ER of SNM. METHODS A literature search encompassing PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar was performed. Two reviewers independently screened for original studies comparing survival outcomes between OR and ER for SNM. Data were systematically collected on study design, patient demographics, outcomes, and level of evidence. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Meta-analysis of overall survival and disease-free survival was performed using random-effects models. RESULTS The initial search yielded 2078 abstracts, of which 9 cohort studies were included for a total of 510 patients from 6 different countries. The average quality of all included studies using the NOS was 7.7 stars. Six out of 7 studies reported no differences in the stages of SNM between patients receiving ER versus OR. Overall survival was longer in the ER group versus OR group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49-0.95). There was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups (HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.28-1.25).

These substances may contain chemicals that interfere with the prescribed drugs and could potentially lead to changes in their efficacy or safety, and could result in alterations in their pharmacokinetic properties. OBJECTIVE To assess the extent of the perception and consumption of food, beverages and herbs alongside conventional drugs, along with their potential interactions, specifically in Jordanian society. METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted in Jordan (20 April - 5 May 2020). The survey was developed using Google Forms, then validated and distributed via social media platforms. Data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences-24. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Use and perception of food, beverages, herbs and how they interact with drugs among Jordanians. RESULTS Of all the participants (n = 789), 77.8% were females, 46.2% were 50-year-olds, 69.7% were married, 70.8% were medically insured, and 51.1% had bachelor's degrees. 70% of the study participants reported use of medicinal plants. About 66% of participants agreed that medicinal plants or herbs could treat diseases and 58.6% thought that medications could interact with drugs. In general, the participants' knowledge about food/beverage/herb-drug interactions was considered poor. However, a linear regression analysis showed that the level of knowledge was significantly affected (p-value <0.05) by gender, marital status, social status, educational level, and employment sector. CONCLUSION Jordanians have a positive perception towards herbs and their ability to treat diseases. However, their knowledge about food/beverage-drug interactions was poor. There is therefore a need to enhance the community awareness of food/beverage/herb-drug interactions.","Thiab, Samar H; Barakat, Muna M; Al-Qudah, Rajaa A; Abutaima, Rana; Jamal, Rahma; Riby, Philip",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33098614/,247

106801,"In the business and politics of medicine, the time to lead is now, but how?",2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Increasingly, neonatal clinics seek to minimize painful experiences and stress for premature infants. Fundoscopy performed with a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope is the reference examination technique for screening of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and it is associated with pain and stress. Wide-field digital retinal imaging is a recent technique that should be evaluated for minimizing infant pain and stress. METHODS The purpose of the study was to assess and compare the impact of using a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope (BIO), or wide-field digital retinal imaging (WFDRI) on pain and stress in infants undergoing ROP screening examination. This was a comparative evaluation study of two screening procedures. Ophthalmologic examinations (N = 70) were performed on 24 infants with both BIO and WFDRI. Pain assessments were performed with two specific neonatal scales (Crying, requires oxygen, increased vital signs, expression and sleeplessness, CRIES and, Premature infant pain profile, PIPP) just prior to the examination, and 30 seconds, 1 hour, and 24 hours later after ending the examination. RESULTS Changes over time were significantly different between BIO and WFDRI with both scales (PIPP score, p = .007, and CRIES score, p = .001). Median PIPP score (interquartile interval) at baseline was 4 (3-5). At 30 seconds the score was 8 (6-9) for BIO and 6 (5-7) for WFDRI, respectively. The increase in PIPP score between baseline and 30 seconds was significantly lower with WFDRI (p = .006). The median increase in CRIES score from baseline to 30 seconds was 1 point lower for WFDRI than for BIO (p < .001). No significant difference in response remained at 1 hour or 24 hour assessments. CONCLUSIONS A transient short-term pain and stress response occurs with both BIO and WFDRI. Infants examined for screening of ROP with digital retinal imaging present less pain and stress at 30 seconds following completion of the exam when compared with binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy.","Moral-Pumarega, M Teresa; Caserío-Carbonero, Sonia; De-La-Cruz-Bértolo, Javier; Tejada-Palacios, Pilar; Lora-Pablos, David; Pallás-Alonso, Carmen R",BMC pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-12-132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22928523/,247

STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo study. ANIMALS Canine cadavers (n = 9). MATERIALS AND METHODS With the aid of a laryngoscope, the larynx was visualized and a mattress suture (double-armed 2-0 polypropylene) was placed through the right arytenoid cartilage and exited the skin ventral to the jugular vein. The ends of the suture were passed through a button and tied on the skin to lateralize the right arytenoid cartilage. Digital images of the larynx were made before and after suture placement. Mean (±SD) rima glottidis cross-sectional area (mm(2) ) was calculated from the digital images and values before and after suture placement were compared using a paired t-test. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant. Change in cross-sectional area was expressed as percent increase. RESULTS Suture placement and the degree of arytenoid lateralization was relatively consistent in all dogs. Mean (±SD) cross-sectional area of the rima glottidis was 126.3 mm(2) (±7.74) before and 172.1 mm(2) (±24.7) after suture placement (P = 0.004). Mean percent increase in cross-sectional area was 25%. CONCLUSION The TPAL technique was effective at enlarging the rima glottidis in this canine cadaveric model. TPAL is rapid to perform and does not require specialized instrumentation. Results of this study support further investigation of the TPAL technique as an alternative to temporary tracheostomy for dogs in severe respiratory distress due to laryngeal paralysis.","Hardie, Robert J",Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care,https://doi.org/10.1111/vec.12514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27566841/,247

108804,COVID-19 Associated Bilateral Acute Iris Transillumination.,2021-06-14,"Background Oesophageal pressure (P oes) is used to approximate pleural pressure (P pl) and therefore to estimate transpulmonary pressure (P L). We aimed to compare oesophageal and regional pleural pressures and to calculate transpulmonary pressures in a prospective physiological study on lung transplant recipients during their stay in the intensive care unit of a tertiary university hospital. Methods Lung transplant recipients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and monitored by oesophageal manometry and dependent and nondependent pleural catheters were investigated during the post-operative period. We performed simultaneous short-time measurements and recordings of oesophageal manometry and pleural pressures. Expiratory and inspiratory P L were computed by subtracting regional P pl or P oes from airway pressure; inspiratory P L was also calculated with the elastance ratio method. Results 16 patients were included. Among them, 14 were analysed. Oesophageal pressures correlated with dependent and nondependent pleural pressures during expiration (R2=0.71, p=0.005 and R2=0.77, p=0.001, respectively) and during inspiration (R2=0.66 for both, p=0.01 and p=0.014, respectively). P L values calculated using P oes were close to those obtained from the dependent pleural catheter but higher than those obtained from the nondependent pleural catheter both during expiration and inspiration. Conclusions In ventilated lung transplant recipients, oesophageal manometry is well correlated with pleural pressure. The absolute value of P oes is higher than P pl of nondependent lung regions and could therefore underestimate the highest level of lung stress in those at high risk of overinflation.","Tilmont, Antoine; Coiffard, Benjamin; Yoshida, Takeshi; Daviet, Florence; Baumstarck, Karine; Brioude, Geoffrey; Hraiech, Sami; Forel, Jean-Marie; Roch, Antoine; Brochard, Laurent; Papazian, Laurent; Guervilly, Christophe",ERJ open research,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00646-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33718491/,247
109543,How Will Patients With Cancer Fare During COVID-19?: Many Unanswered Questions.,2020-12-03,"BACKGROUND This systematic review compares the efficacy and safety of surgical and non-surgical interventions for full- thickness rotator cuff tears. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in five databases. Randomized (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials of interventions (non-RCTs) for the surgical or non-surgical treatment of patients with traumatic or atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears were included. The review protocol was published in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42018100343). RESULTS Ten studies (three RCTs with 332 participants; seven non-RCTs with 650 participants) met the inclusion criteria. One year after treatment, shoulder function, measured with the 100-point Constant score, had improved by 6.7 points (95% confidence interval [2.3; 11.0]) and pain, measured with the 10-cm visual analog scale, by 1.1 cm (0.5; 1.7] in the full-thickness rotator cuff tears treated surgically compared with non-surgical treatment. In one study the difference in favor of surgery persisted after 10 years' follow-up. For other outcomes, such as range of motion, muscle strength, quality of life, and adverse events, the data were sparse and the group differences were similar. The findings of the non-RCTs were comparable with those of the RCTs. CONCLUSION With regard to functional improvement and pain reduction, surgical treatment of full-thickness rotator cuff tears was superior to non-surgical treatment in the short and the long term. Whether the differences between the groups are relevant for individual cases is uncertain, as the measured results were distributed below and above the threshold of clinical relevance. The conclusions may not be applicable to rotator cuff tears over 3 cm in size or to young persons.","Schmucker, Christine; Titscher, Viktoria; Braun, Cordula; Nussbaumer-Streit, Barbara; Gartlehner, Gerald; Meerpohl, Jörg",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2020.0633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263527/,247
110448,Epileptiform activity and seizures in patients with COVID-19.,2020-11-06,"Earlier, 13 haplotype groups defined by SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence variations were identified in 2790 sequences available in March 2020. Also, 23403A>G that causes p.Asp614Gly in the spike protein and is one of the defining variations of the haplotype group H1, was becoming increasingly prevalent. As a follow-up, 74922 SARS-CoV-2 sequences retrieved from individuals infected in June 1 through November 15 were analyzed. Consistent with the reports on 23403A>G, H1 haplotype frequency increased world-wide; among August to November sequences, only 0.3% were associated with non-H1 haplotypes. This finding prompted assessment of H1 sub-haplotypes among the sequences of the later stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The distribution of the sub-haplotypes differed in different regions, but 98.4% of the sequences were associated with five H1 sub-haplotypes. One of these had not been previously observed and had emerged in Europe by June 2020. The most important finding of the present study is identification of this new sub-haplotype (H1r) and finding evidences that suggest it may have a high potential for expansion. Its frequency had reached 10%-90% in various countries/territories of Europe by the end of September. The new sub-haplotype is defined by seven sequence variations, one of which causes Ala222Val in the spike protein. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS We evaluated 397 patients who were follow-up and treated due to COVID-19 infections. The ages, genders, chronic diseases, ABO and Rh blood group antigens, admission rates to Intensive Care Units (ICU), and mortality rates of the patients were analyzed. FINDINGS The mean age of the 397 patients with COVID-19 was 47±17 years. In the blood group analysis of the patients, A Rh-positive (A +) was the most frequently seen blood type (176 patients, 44.3%) followed by O Rh-positive (0 +) (109 patients, 27,5%); 38 patients were Rh negative (Rh -) (9,6%). 53 of the patients (13,4%) were followed in ICU and 29 patients died (7,3%). Neither mortality nor admission to ICU was seen for Rh - group. The comparison of Rh groups concerning the need for ICU admission revealed a significantly high rate of ICU admission in the Rh + group (p=0,011), while no significant relationship was found between mortality and Rh antigen (p=0,069). CONCLUSION The most frequently seen blood type among COVID-19 patients was A +. The Rh + blood group was found in all cases who were admitted to ICU and had a death outcome. The Rh + blood group was found in a significantly high number of patients who were admitted to ICU, while no significant relationship was found between mortality and Rh blood group.","Yaylacı, Selçuk; Dheir, Hamad; İşsever, Kubilay; Genc, Ahmed Bilal; Şenocak, Didar; Kocayigit, Havva; Guclu, Ertugrul; Suner, Kezban; Ekerbicer, Hasan; Koroglu, Mehmet",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.s2.86; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32965363/,247

The objective of this work is to describe the activities promoted by the pharmacist in the care of the critically ill patient in this context. A new organizational structure was designed, analyzing the tasks necessary to make the processes profitable. Two pharmacists joined the critical patient care to help the pharmacist who was already integrated in the ICU team. The development of the operational structure was carried out on three levels. The healthcare activity highlights the daily participation of pharmacists in the two clinical sessions in which the ICU teams evaluated all cases and made decisions. This in turn facilitated the pharmaceutical validation that was carried out in the critical units themselves. In addition, one of the pharmacists created the Immuno-COVID Committee, in which they participated together with different specialists for therapeutic decision-making in the most complex cases. On the other hand, the availability of human and material resources allowed the implantation of centralized elaboration in the Pharmacy Service of many intravenous mixtures, including antibiotics elastomers Pumps for continuous infusion, and non-sterile elaborations. In logistics management, in addition to the acquisition of COVID- 19 therapies, the reconciliation with nursing activity stands out. The physical presence of the pharmacist favored the detection of needs, the availability in time of medications in the unit, including sterile and non-sterile preparations, and coordination with the central pharmacy. In knowledge management, the participation of the pharmacist in the working group for the development of the hospital management protocol COVID-19 stands out. The daily presence in the unit and the joint work with the entire multidisciplinary team demonstrate the value that the pharmacist can bring.

However, the face-related response sometimes appears to be bihemispheric. A few studies have argued that bilaterality depended on the sex composition of the sample. To shed light on this matter, two meta-analyses were conducted starting from a large initial database of 250 ERP/MEG peer-reviewed scientific articles. Paper coverage was 1985-2020. Thirty-four articles met the inclusion criteria of a sufficiently large and balanced sample size with strictly right-handed and healthy participants aged 18-35 and N170 measurements in response to neutral front view faces at left and right occipito/temporal sites. The data of 817 male (n = 414) and female (n = 403) healthy adults were subjected to repeated measures analyses of variance. The results of statistical analyses from the data of 17 independent studies (from Asia, Europe and America) seem to robustly indicate the presence of a sex difference in the way the two cerebral hemispheres process facial information in humans, with a marked right-sided asymmetry of the bioelectrical activity in males and a bilateral or left-sided activity in females.","Proverbio, Alice Mado",Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsab043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33835164/,247

There are several methods to address this problem; however, these techniques are not without problems. The purpose of this study was to introduce and evaluate a new technique to address this problem. METHODS This is a prospective study of consecutive patients. All patients diagnosed with direct inguinal hernias eligible for laparoscopic repair were included. A single surgeon performed all the included operations. During laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (TAPP or TEP), we closed the direct hernia defect with barbed sutures around the transversalis fascia, inverted the apex of the attenuated transversalis fascia, and sutured it at the base to completely eradicate the defect cavity. Prosthetic mesh was not additionally fixed in all patients. The primary postoperative outcome parameter was seroma formation, and secondary outcome parameters included groin pain, surgical complications, and hernia recurrence. RESULTS Twenty-five male patients with 36 sides of direct hernias were included in this study, and all procedures were carried out laparoscopically and successfully. Only one patient developed significant seroma, which resolved 1 month later. The early postoperative pain was minimal, and no recurrence and chronic pain occurred during the follow-up period (4-13 months). CONCLUSIONS The present direct inguinal hernia defect closing technique with barbed suture is a simple, easily reproducible, and effective method for the prevention of seroma formation.","Li, Junsheng; Zhang, Weiyu",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5760-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28779243/,247

All measures, especially in the first wave of the pandemic, were in combination with recommendations provided by professional and scientific organizations. Similar measures were applied to specific procedures, such as the management of infertility, including in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) treatments. Although there is no clear scientific evidence yet that the SARS-CoV-2 may exert negative effects on IVF outcome, especially at the early stages, several clinical reports indicate that the virus may impact male fertility through specific receptors presented at the somatic cells of the testis and used by the virus in order to gain entry to the respective cells. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to suspect that the virus may affect sperm function as well as oocyte performance directly through specific receptors or indirectly through other signaling pathways. Despite the good practice of IVF laboratory techniques, culture media may also be contaminated during equilibration when airborne virus's particles can contaminate culture media from an already infected embryology area or staff. Furthermore, although there is no clinical evidence, liquid nitrogen could be a route of infection for gametes and embryos when it has been contaminated during production or transportation. Therefore, cryopreservation of gametes and embryos must be virus-free. This communication aims to provide some aspects of the possible impact of the virus on gametes and embryos and how it may affect the cryopreservation procedures.Abbreviations: ACE2: angiotensin- converting enzyme 2; ART: assisted reproductive technology; ASRM: American Society for Reproductive Medicine; CDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019; ESHRE: European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology; ET: embryo transfer; FSH: follicle stimulating hormone; IFFS: International Federation of Fertility Societies; IVF: in vitro fertilization; LH: luteinizing hormone; LN: liquid nitrogen; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; T: testosterone; WHO: World Health Organization.","Anifandis, George; Messini, Christina I; Simopoulou, Mara; Sveronis, George; Garas, Antonios; Daponte, Alexandros; Messinis, Ioannis E",Systems biology in reproductive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/19396368.2021.1922537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34060390/,247

Relevant symptoms, comorbid illnesses, laboratory results, imaging studies, treatment, and outcomes were reviewed. Descriptive analyses to compare features over time were performed. RESULTS We identified 81 cases of KD-like illnesses from January 1, 2016, to May 31, 2020. Few clinical features, such as gallbladder involvement, were more prevalent in 2020 than in previous years. A few patients in 2020 required more intensive treatment with interleukin 1 receptor antagonist therapy. There were no other clear differences in incidence, laboratory parameters, number of doses of intravenous immunoglobulin, or outcomes over the years of the study. CONCLUSIONS There was no difference in incidence, laboratory parameters, or number of doses of intravenous immunoglobulin required for treatment of KD-like illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with previous years at our institution.

116212,Effect of Tracheal Intubation Mode on Cuff Pressure During Retractor Splay and Dysphonia Recovery after for Anterior Cervical Spine Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,2019-11-19,"OBJECTIVES Open abdomen (OA) treatment is sometimes necessary after surgery for aortic aneurysm (AA), to prevent or treat abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). A multicentre study evaluating vacuum-assisted wound closure (100-150 mmHg) and mesh-mediated fascial traction (VAWCM) was performed. METHODS All patients treated with OA after AA repair (2006-2009) were prospectively registered at four centres; those treated <5 days were excluded. All surviving patients underwent a 1-year follow-up, including computed tomography (CT) examination. RESULTS Among 1041 patients treated with open or endovascular repair of AA, 28 (2.9%) had OA treatment with VAWCM; another two had VAWCM after hybrid operations for thoraco-abdominal AA. Eighteen (60%) were operated on for rupture and 12 (40%) electively. Eight had suprarenal or thoraco-abdominal aneurysms. Eight (27%) died within 30 days, none due to OA-related complications. Four died before abdominal closure; primary delayed fascial closure was achieved in all survivors. One-year mortality was 50%. Ten (33%) had bowel ischaemia requiring bowel resection. Late potential OA-related infectious complications occurred in five (17%), all of whom first developed intestinal ischaemia: entero-atmospheric fistulae (two), graft infections (two), aorto-enteric fistula (one). One year follow-up with clinical evaluation and CT showed no signs of graft infection. Incisional hernias occurred in 9 of 15 patients (60%); only three were symptomatic. CONCLUSION VAWCM provided high fascial closure rate after AA repair and long-term OA treatment. Infectious complications occur after intestinal ischaemia and prolonged OA treatment, and are often fatal. The poor prognosis among patients needing OA after AA surgery may be improved by using VAWCM, permitting earlier closure.","Sörelius, K; Wanhainen, A; Acosta, S; Svensson, M; Djavani-Gidlund, K; Björck, M",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejvs.2013.01.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23465456/,247

Model prediction method can serve as a pre-screening tool to quickly estimate the effectiveness of UV254 irradiation on emerging or unculturable viruses. In this study, an improved prediction model was applied to estimate UV254 photolysis kinetics of viral genomes (kpred, genome) based on the genome sequences and their photoreactivity and to correlate with the experimental virus infectivity loss kinetics (kexp, infectivity). The UV254 inactivation data of 102 viruses (including 2 dsRNA, 65 ssRNA, 33 dsDNA and 2 ssDNA viruses) were collected from the published experimental data with kexp, infectivity ranging from 0.016 to 3.49 cm2 mJ-1. The model had fairly good performance in predicting the virus susceptibility to UV254 irradiation except dsRNA viruses (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.64) and 70% of kpred, genome fell in the range of 1/2 to 2 times of kexp, infectivity. The positive deviation of the model often occurred for photoresistant viruses with low kexp, infectivity less than 0.20 cm2 mJ-1 (e.g., Adenovirus, Papovaviridae and Retroviridae). We also applied this model to predict the UV254 inactivation rate of SARS-CoV-2 (kpred, genome = 3.168 cm2 mJ-1) and a UV dose of 3 mJ cm-2 seemed to be able to achieve a 2-log removal by conservative calculation using 1/2kpred, genome value. This prediction method can be used as a prescreening tool to assess the effectiveness of UV254 irradiation for emerging/unculturable viruses in water or wastewater treatment.","Cheng, Shuangshuang; Ge, Yuexian; Lee, Yunho; Yang, Xin",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962243/,247

Anesthesia was given using target-controlled infusion of propofol based on the Kataria model. Propofol target plasma concentration was 7 μg/ml for 15 min, followed by 1 μg/ml for 15 min or until signs of awakening, followed by 5 μg/ml for 15 min. Venous blood samples were taken 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 min after each change in target. A classic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was estimated, and the methodology of other studies was duplicated using pharmacokinetic models from the literature and (re-)estimating the pharmacodynamic models. RESULTS There is no clear relationship between pharmacokinetic precision and the pharmacodynamic objective function. Low pharmacodynamic objective function values are not associated with accurate estimation of the pharmacodynamic parameters when the pharmacokinetic model is taken from other sources. CONCLUSION Minimization of the pharmacodynamic objective function does not select the most accurate pharmacokinetic model. Using population pharmacokinetic models from the literature instead of the 'true' pharmacokinetic model can lead to better predictions of bispectral index while incorrectly estimating the pharmacodynamic parameters.","Coppens, Marc J; Eleveld, Douglas J; Proost, Johannes H; Marks, Luc A M; Van Bocxlaer, Jan F P; Vereecke, Hugo; Absalom, Anthony R; Struys, Michel M R F",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0b013e31821a8d80; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21555936/,247

METHODS/MATERIALS For a period of 6 years, we recruited women undergoing surgery for vulval carcinoma. All women had a preoperative biopsy confirming the depth of invasion greater than 1 mm. Sentinel lymph node detection was performed using the combined method (Tc-99m and methylene-blue dye). The standard management included complete inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. When inguinofemoral lymph nodes were found grossly to be enlarged, these nodes were debulked, and the women subsequently treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. During the last 2 years of the study, a selected group of women had an SLN dissection alone. The SLNs were ultrastaged when they were negative on routine hematoxylin and eosin examination. RESULTS Among 60 women undergoing SLN detection, SLN was detected in 59 women (98.3%) with combined method. Blue dye did not detect an SLN in 3 women resulting in a 93.3% detection rate. The median SLN count was 2 nodes (range, 1-9). Of the 60 women, 41 had inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy, 4 had only enlarged inguinofemoral nodes debulked, and 15 had the SLN only removed. The non-SLN count was 9 nodes (range, 3-17). There were no false-negative SLNs. Twenty-one women (35%) had positive nodes on final histology. Ultrastaging increased detection of metastases in 6.9% of nodes relative to routine hematoxylin and eosin examination and upstaged 12% of women. The median follow-up was 24 months (range, 2-66 months). CONCLUSIONS Sentinel lymph node detection is safe and accurate in assessing lymph node status in women with vulval cancer undergoing staging. The combined method using Tc-99m and methylene blue dye injection for SLN detection has the best detection rate. Routine ultrastaging of negative SLN improves the detection of nodal metastases.","Devaja, Omer; Mehra, Gautam; Coutts, Michael; Adamson, Sebastian; Montalto, Steven Attard; Donaldson, John; Papadopoulos, Andreas J",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0b013e3182119d8d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21430459/,247

We report a prospectively collected clinical experience with a new technique utilizing a direct aspiration first pass technique with large bore aspiration catheter as the primary method for vessel recanalization. METHODS 98 prospectively identified acute ischemic stroke patients with 100 occluded large cerebral vessels at six institutions were included in the study. The ADAPT technique was utilized in all patients. Procedural and clinical data were captured for analysis. RESULTS The aspiration component of the ADAPT technique alone was successful in achieving Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2b or 3 revascularization in 78% of cases. The additional use of stent retrievers improved the TICI 2b/3 revascularization rate to 95%. The average time from groin puncture to at least TICI 2b recanalization was 37 min. A 5MAX demonstrated similar success to a 5MAX ACE in achieving TICI 2b/3 revascularization alone (75% vs 82%, p=0.43). Patients presented with an admitting median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 17.0 (12.0-21.0) and improved to a median NIHSS score at discharge of 7.3 (1.0-11.0). Ninety day functional outcomes were 40% (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2) and 20% (mRS 6). There were two procedural complications and no symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages. DISCUSSION The ADAPT technique is a fast, safe, simple, and effective method that has facilitated our approach to acute ischemic stroke thrombectomy by utilizing the latest generation of large bore aspiration catheters to achieve previously unparalleled angiographic outcomes.","Turk, Aquilla S; Frei, Don; Fiorella, David; Mocco, J; Baxter, Blaise; Siddiqui, Adnan; Spiotta, Alex; Mokin, Maxim; Dewan, Michael; Quarfordt, Steve; Battenhouse, Holly; Turner, Raymond; Chaudry, Imran",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011125.rep; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30037944/,247

We conducted a study comparing patients in the Emergency Department in the first weeks of the pandemic in Norway (weeks 11 and 12) with the average number of patient visits. MATERIAL AND METHOD Data from patients at the Emergency Department of St Olav's Hospital in the period 6 January 2020-22 March 2020 were retrieved from the Emergency Department's database. Logistical patient data concerning patient numbers, chief complaints, length of stay in the Emergency Department, acuity level, isolation status, and treatment level were analysed. RESULTS In week 12, 331 patients were referred to the Emergency Department, a reduction of 39 % compared with the average of 541 patients in weeks 2-10. There was a general reduction in all patient groups, but particularly those discharged from the Emergency Department. In week 12 there were 56 more patients isolated with suspected/potentially infectious disease (187 %) compared with the average for weeks 2-10, and these patients spent almost two hours longer in the Emergency Department than other patients. INTERPRETATION There was a reduction in patient visits to the Emergency Department in the first weeks of the pandemic. The percentage of patients isolated for infection control increased, and the time spent in the Emergency Department for these patients was greater than for other patients. The reduction in the inflow of patients is expected to be temporary, and the Emergency Department at St Olav's Hospital expects a large influx of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease.","Bjørnsen, Lars Petter; Næss-Pleym, Lars Eide; Dale, Jostein; Laugsand, Lars Erik","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.20.0277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32463204/,247
124210,Stepwise Strategic Mitigation Planning in a Pediatric Oncology Center During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-03-08,"Population aging has led to an increased focus on the environmental context in which we age. While researchers have identified significant health benefits associated with built community features such as housing, transportation and outdoor spaces and buildings, less attention has focused on the correlates of healthy aging and other characteristics via the perspective of community-dwelling older adults. This study utilized cluster analysis to examine health-related subgroups of older adults (n = 598) in an age-friendly community located in the United States, of which nearly half of its residents are age 60 and older. Linear regression was used to associate the health clusters with perceptions of built environmental features and socio-demographics. Four distinct profiles were identified, with the greatest preference for housing and transportation found among those reporting poorer health compared to those reporting excellent health across multi-dimensional healthy aging measures. Perceptions on the importance of built environmental features were also found to vary by age, income and home accessibility status. Findings suggest that older adults' perceptions about built environmental features differ across health and home status as well as age and income, underscoring opportunities for public health action to better reach and engage older adults by life-course trajectories in age-friendly communities.","Black, Kathy; Jester, Dylan J",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17197056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32992480/,247

OBJECTIVES To first evaluate the inflammatory profiles of CRSsNP and CRSwNP tissues and then to investigate whether clinical differences observed between CRSwNP and AERD are in part secondary to differences in inflammatory mediator expression within nasal polyp (NP) tissues. METHODS Expression levels of numerous inflammatory mediators were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, ELISA, and multiplex immunoassay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS CRSwNP NP had increased levels of type 2 mediators, including IL-5 (P < 0.001), IL-13 (P < 0.001), eotaxin-2 (P < 0.001), and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-4 (P < 0.01), compared with sinonasal tissue from subjects with CRSsNP and control subjects. Expression of IFN-γ messenger RNA or protein was low and not different among the chronic rhinosinusitis subtypes examined. Compared with CRSwNP, AERD NP had elevated protein levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) (P < 0.001), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (P < 0.01), and MCP-1 (P = 0.01), as well as decreased gene expression of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (P = 0.02). Despite the higher eosinophilia in AERD, there was no associated increase in type 2 mediator protein levels observed. CONCLUSIONS CRSwNP was characterized by a predominant type 2 inflammatory environment, whereas CRSsNP did not reflect a classic type 1 milieu, as has been suggested previously. AERD can be distinguished from CRSwNP by elevated ECP levels, but this enhanced eosinophilia is not associated with elevations in traditional type 2 inflammatory mediators associated with eosinophil proliferation and recruitment. However, other factors, including GM-CSF, MCP-1, and tPA, may be important contributors to AERD pathogenesis.","Stevens, Whitney W; Ocampo, Christopher J; Berdnikovs, Sergejs; Sakashita, Masafumi; Mahdavinia, Mahboobeh; Suh, Lydia; Takabayashi, Tetsuji; Norton, James E; Hulse, Kathryn E; Conley, David B; Chandra, Rakesh K; Tan, Bruce K; Peters, Anju T; Grammer, Leslie C; Kato, Atsushi; Harris, Kathleen E; Carter, Roderick G; Fujieda, Shigeharu; Kern, Robert C; Schleimer, Robert P",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201412-2278oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26067893/,247

Basket trials typically involve few patients per type, making it challenging to rigorously compare responses across types. We describe the use of permutation testing to test for differences among subgroups using empirical null distributions and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control for false discovery. We apply the approach retrospectively to tumor-volume changes and progression-free survival in published basket trials for neratinib, larotrectinib, pembrolizumab, and imatinib and uncover examples of therapeutic benefit missed by conventional binomial testing. For example, we identify an overlooked opportunity for use of neratinib in lung cancers carrying ERBB2 Exon 20 mutations.

126527,Reply to work from home culture and acute cardiovascular events: A bidirectional conundrum yet to be resolved!,2021-03-17,"The glycoprotein complex (GPC) of arenaviruses, composed of stable signal peptide, GP1, and GP2, is the only antigen correlated with antibody-mediated neutralization. However, despite strong cross-reactivity of convalescent antisera between related arenavirus species, weak or no cross-neutralization occurs. Two closely related clade B viruses, Machupo virus (MACV) and Junín virus (JUNV), have nearly identical overall GPC architecture and share a host receptor, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). Given structural and functional similarities of the GP1 receptor binding site (RBS) of these viruses and the recent demonstration that the RBS is an important target for neutralizing antibodies, it is not clear how these viruses avoid cross-neutralization. To address this, MACV/JUNV chimeric GPCs were assessed for interaction with a group of α-JUNV GPC monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and mouse antisera against JUNV or MACV GPC. All six MAbs targeted GP1, with those that neutralized JUNV GPC-pseudovirions competing with each other for RBS binding. However, these MAbs were unable to bind to a chimeric GPC composed of JUNV GP1 containing a small disulfide bonded loop (loop 10) unique to MACV GPC, suggesting that this loop may block MAbs interaction with the GP1 RBS. Consistent with this loop causing interference, mouse anti-JUNV GPC antisera that solely neutralized pseudovirions bearing autologous GP1 provided enhanced neutralization of MACV GPC when this loop was removed. Our studies provide evidence that loop 10, which is unique to MACV GP1, is an important impediment to binding of neutralizing antibodies and contributes to the poor cross-neutralization of α-JUNV antisera against MACV.IMPORTANCE Multiple New World arenaviruses can cause severe disease in humans, and some geographic overlap exists among these viruses. A vaccine that protects against a broad range of New World arenaviruses is desirable for purposes of simplicity, cost, and broad protection against multiple National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease-assigned category A priority pathogens. In this study, we sought to better understand how closely related arenaviruses elude cross-species neutralization by investigating the structural bases of antibody binding and avoidance. In our studies, we found that neutralizing antibodies against two New World arenaviruses, Machupo virus (MACV) and Junín virus (JUNV), bound to the envelope glycoprotein 1 (GP1) with JUNV monoclonal antibodies targeting the receptor binding site (RBS). We further show that altered structures surrounding the RBS pocket in MACV GP1 impede access of JUNV-elicited antibodies.","Brouillette, Rachel B; Phillips, Elisabeth K; Ayithan, Natarajan; Maury, Wendy",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01454-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28100617/,247

128537,Kawasaki like illness due to COVID-19: a review of the literature.,2021-05-31,"Sex hormone concentrations of eumenorrheic women typically fluctuate across the menstrual cycle and can affect neural function such that estrogen has neuroexcitatory effects, and progesterone induces inhibition. However, the effects of these changes on corticospinal and intracortical circuitry and the motor performance of the knee extensors are unknown. The present two-part investigation aimed to 1) determine the measurement error of an exercise task, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-, and motor nerve stimulation (MNS)-derived responses in women ingesting a monophasic oral contraceptive pill (hormonally-constant) and 2) investigate whether these measures were modulated by menstrual cycle phase (MCP), by examining them before and after an intermittent isometric fatiguing task (60% of maximal voluntary contraction, MVC) with the knee extensors until task failure in eumenorrheic women on days 2, 14, and 21 of the menstrual cycle. The repeatability of neuromuscular measures at baseline and fatigability ranged between moderate and excellent in women taking the oral contraceptive pill. MVC was not affected by MCP (P = 0.790). Voluntary activation (MNS and TMS) peaked on day 14 (P = 0.007 and 0.008, respectively). Whereas corticospinal excitability was unchanged, short-interval intracortical inhibition was greatest on day 21 compared with days 14 and 2 (P < 0.001). Additionally, time to task failure was longer on day 21 than on both days 14 and 2 (24 and 36%, respectively, P = 0.030). The observed changes were larger than the associated measurement errors. These data demonstrate that neuromuscular function and fatigability of the knee extensors vary across the menstrual cycle and may influence exercise performance involving locomotor muscles. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The present two-part study first demonstrated the repeatability of transcranial magnetic stimulation- and electrical motor nerve stimulation-evoked variables in a hormonally constant female population. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the eumenorrheic menstrual cycle affects neuromuscular function. Changing concentrations of neuroactive hormones corresponded to greater voluntary activation on day 14, greater intracortical inhibition on day 21, and lowest fatigability on day 21. These alterations of knee extensor neuromuscular function have implications for locomotor activities.","Ansdell, Paul; Brownstein, Callum G; Škarabot, Jakob; Hicks, Kirsty M; Simoes, Davina C M; Thomas, Kevin; Howatson, Glyn; Hunter, Sandra K; Goodall, Stuart",Journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.01041.2018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30844334/,247

Histopathological findings typically include mesangial hypercellularity with IgM and complement deposition, though the spectrum may range from normal glomeruli through to focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis. Thromboembolism is a well recognised complication of nephrotic syndrome, but cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is rarely described. CASE PRESENTATION This is the case of a 23-year-old male presenting with the nephrotic syndrome, whose initial renal biopsy was consistent with minimal change disease. Complete remission was achieved with prednisone, however multiple relapses and steroid dependence prompted re-biopsy, the results of which were more consistent with IgM nephropathy. His last relapse was complicated by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. He then received rituximab and a weaning course of prednisone to again enter remission. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the need to consider IgM nephropathy in the differential diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Additionally, it emphasises the risk of thrombosis in patients with severe nephrosis.","Downie, Elizabeth; Diep, Jason; Sungala, Nagendraprasad; Wong, Jeffrey",BMC nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-020-02048-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894094/,247

Despite advances in treatment, there remain well-recognised morbidity and mortality. Risk stratification requires the identification and validation of biomarkers, old and new. Hyponatremia has re-emerged as a prognostic marker in CHF patients. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study on 241 CHF patients recruited from King Fahd Hospital of the University, Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia (January 2005-December 2016). Their serum sodium and biochemical parameters were measured at baseline, along with 2-D echocardiographic assessments of left ventricular mass and ejection fraction. The primary endpoint was the association between hyponatremia and all-cause mortality (ACM) after a follow-up period of 24 months. Results Mean age of patients was 60.61 ± 12.63 (SD) years; 65.1% were males, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) was present in 71%. Baseline serum sodium was 138.00 (136, 140) (median and interquartile range). Hyponatremia (<135 meq/L) was present in 14.1%. After follow-up, 46 deaths had occurred. Multivariate Cox-proportional hazard model showed that type 2 DM, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (III-IV vs I-II), age, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were significant and independent predictors of ACM, with HR 3.03 (95% CI; 1.13, 8.16) (P=0.028), HR 2.31 (95% CI; 1.11, 4.82) (P=0.026), HR 1.06 (95% CI; 1.03, 1.09) (P<0.001), and HR 1.01 (95% CI; 1.00, 1.02) (P=0.039), respectively. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was not a significant predictor. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used for the analysis of NYHA class and hyponatremia interactions and showed that hyponatremia had an association with poorer survival in patients with NYHA class III-IV rather than I-II (Log-rank test, P= 0.0009). Conclusion Hyponatremia was a feature in CHF patients, and ACM was predicted by type 2 DM, NYHA class, age, and LVMI. Hyponatremia impact on survival was in patients with more advanced disease.","Alem, Manal M",International journal of general medicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s260256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765046/,247

METHODS The study included 86 patients (48 male, 60.2 ± 16.6 years) with COVID-19. In addition to common investigation, examination of troponin T (n = 18) and anti-heart antibodies (AHA, n = 34) were used. The average hospital period was 14 [12; 18] days. RESULTS The incidence of cardiovascular disease and symptoms was 45.3%. Arrhythmias, heart failure, low-QRS voltage, repolarization disorders, and pericardial effusion were the typical for coronavirus cardiac injury. The level of AHA was increased in 73.5%. Significant (p < 0.05) correlations of AHA level with inflammatory activity, pneumonia, respiratory failure, cardiac symptoms, and death were found. D-dimer >0.5 μg/mL had a sensitivity of 79.2% and specificity of 60% in the prediction of cardiovascular manifestations. Cardiac failure was one of the causes of death in 3/8 patients (37.5%). Lethality in the presence of cardiovascular pathology was 17.9 versus 2.2% without it, p < 0.05. The most powerful prognostic model includes age, diabetes, oxygen therapy volume, maximum leukocyte level, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer (correlation coefficient 0.871, p < 0.001). The model with only age, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease included also had predictive power (correlation coefficient 0.568, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The cardiovascular pathology is frequent in patients with COVID-19 and strong correlates with the D-dimer. It indicates the high significance of prothrombotic and ischemic mechanisms. High AHA levels may reflect an inflammatory heart injury.

Although previous studies have generally used genetically verified pedigrees to document effects of inbreeding and gene flow, these often fail to capture the whole inbreeding history of the species. By assembling a draft arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) genome and re-sequencing complete genomes of 23 additional foxes born before and after a well-documented immigration event in Scandinavia, we here look into the genomic consequences of inbreeding and genetic rescue. We found a difference in genome-wide diversity, with 18% higher heterozygosity and 81% lower FROH in immigrant F1 compared to native individuals. However, more distant descendants of immigrants (F2, F3) did not show the same pattern. We also found that foxes with lower inbreeding had higher probability to survive their first year of life. Our results demonstrate the important link between genetic variation and fitness as well as the transient nature of genetic rescue. Moreover, our results have implications in conservation biology as they demonstrate that inbreeding depression can effectively be detected in the wild by a genomic approach.","Hasselgren, Malin; Dussex, Nicolas; von Seth, Johanna; Angerbjörn, Anders; Olsen, Remi-André; Dalén, Love; Norén, Karin",Molecular ecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955096/,247

There is a paucity of evidence on the causative pathways for this trend, but expert opinions, commentaries, and some reviews offer theoretical underpinnings. METHODS In this rapid review, we collate the available published evidence, expert opinions, commentaries, and reviews on the unintended pathways between COVID-19 public health responses and increasing illicit drug overdoses. Using tenets of thematic analyses and grounded theory, we also offer a visual conceptual framework for these unintended pathways. RESULTS Our framework focuses on five particular public health responses, namely social isolation/physical distancing/quarantine; staff/resource reallocations and reductions; closures of businesses and other places of employment; border closures and transportation restrictions; and the early release of people from prisons. As argued in the literature reviewed here, these public health responses have unintentionally created increased overdose risks by producing high risk use scenarios; increased risks of relapsing; disrupted addictions services and treatment; an increasingly toxic supply of drugs; and the risk of using with lowered tolerance. CONCLUSIONS Health care systems should respond to these pathways to mitigate the unintended consequences. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic may represent an opportunity to enact proactive, progressive, and innovative solutions to an overdose crisis that will surely outlast the current pandemic.","Nguyen, Tribesty; Buxton, Jane A",The International journal on drug policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838990/,247
132458,Covid-19: US approves emergency use of convalescent plasma despite warnings over lack of evidence.,2020-08-25,"BACKGROUND We propose that needlescopic surgery (NS) should be considered as a way of improving the esthetic result and post-operative quality of life of patients and of reducing costs and stress on surgeons, and we have evaluated the results of NS. METHODS We used NS in 157 patients between May 1998 and December 2010: cholecystectomy in 150 patients, marsupialization of splenic and hepatic cysts in 4 and splenectomy in 3, respectively. Under general anesthesia, one 12-mm and two or three 2- or 3-mm ports were introduced into the operative field. The specimen was retrieved from the 12-mm wound using a plastic bag. RESULTS The procedures were successfully completed in all patients without conversion to an open procedure. In eight (5.3%) of 150 cholecystectomies a change to 5-mm instruments was required. The mean operation times and postoperative hospital stays for cholecystectomy, splenectomy, and marsupialization of splenic and hepatic cysts were 80.2 min and 3.2 days, 167 min and 5.6 days, 170 min and 7 days, and 120 min and 7 days, respectively. There were a few perioperative complications. The most important factor for reducing operation time and achieving a low conversion rate is the use of at least one 3- or 5-mm port for the grasping instruments in cholecystectomy. We recognized a residual cyst requiring splenectomy 62 months after marsupialization in one case. Technical points for performing safe procedures on solid organs were: no direct organ mobilization to avoid organ injuries, the rotation of the operating table and the utilization of organ gravity to create a better operative field, the minimum use of the needlescope to perform a safe maneuver and the improvement of bi-manual technique. CONCLUSIONS NS is a safe and feasible procedure for achieving minimal invasive surgery. We should consider NS as a first choice to treat operable diseases in this laparoscopic era.","Tagaya, Nobumi; Abe, Akihito; Kubota, Keiichi",Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00534-011-0398-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21584706/,247

The aim of the study was to assess if alterations in gene expression of microRNAs associated with diabetes/cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases are present in whole peripheral blood of children aged 3-11 years descending from GDM complicated pregnancies. A substantially altered microRNA expression profile was found in children descending from GDM complicated pregnancies. Almost all microRNAs with the exception of miR-92a-3p, miR-155-5p, and miR-210-3p were upregulated. The microRNA expression profile also differed between children after normal and GDM complicated pregnancies in relation to the presence of overweight/obesity, prehypertension/hypertension, and/or valve problems and heart defects. Always, screening based on the combination of microRNAs was superior over using individual microRNAs, since at 10.0% false positive rate it was able to identify a large proportion of children with an aberrant microRNA expression profile (88.14% regardless of clinical findings, 75.41% with normal clinical findings, and 96.49% with abnormal clinical findings). In addition, the higher incidence of valve problems and heart defects was found in children with a prior exposure to GDM. The extensive file of predicted targets of all microRNAs aberrantly expressed in children descending from GDM complicated pregnancies indicates that a large group of these genes is involved in ontologies of diabetes/cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases. In general, children with a prior exposure to GDM are at higher risk of later development of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases, and would benefit from dispensarisation as well as implementation of primary prevention strategies.","Hromadnikova, Ilona; Kotlabova, Katerina; Dvorakova, Lenka; Krofta, Ladislav; Sirc, Jan",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9061557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604801/,247
133380,Eliciting vulnerable patients' preferences regarding colorectal cancer screening: a systematic review.,2018,"INTRODUCTION Blepharospasm is a condition of involuntary spasm of the orbicularis oculi muscle which leads to intermittent or complete closure of the eyelids. Botulinum toxin is the currently recommended first line treatment for such blepharospasm. This study aims to find out the outcome of injection Botulinum toxin Type A in Blepharospasm. MATERIALS AND METHODS It was a hospital based, prospective, interventional study conducted on patients diagnosed as Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB), Meige syndrome (MS) and Hemifacial spasm (HFS) by oculoplastic surgeon at Oculoplasty department OPD, Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology, from December 2018 to November 2019. After taking all standard precautions for botulinum toxin injections, 6 to 8 sites for injecting 2.5 to 5 IU of the toxin were given. All the patients were evaluated before and after injections according to Jankovic spasm grading and improvement in functional impairment scale and followed on one week, one month, three month and when the symptoms reappeared. RESULTS A total of 43 cases which included 32 cases of Benign essential Blepharospasm, 9 Hemifacial spasm and 2 Meige syndrome. The mean Jankovic severity score was 3.51 ± 0.51 (range 3-4). The mean improvement in functional score was 2.60 ± 0.54 (range 1-3), was statistically significant (p-value <0.001).The effective period of injection was 130 ± 20.82 (93 - 189) days.38 patients had repeated injections after reappearance of symptoms. 4 patients had side effects of redness and hematoma at one site. CONCLUSION This study concludes that Botulinum toxin type A is effective in the management of Benign essential blepharospasm, Hemifacial spasm and Meige syndrome. This along with a good safety profile justifies its role as a first line treatment therapy in blepharospasm. However, it is a temporary treatment option where the effect lasts for a short period of time and repeated injections are required.","Amatya, Malita; Limbu, Ben; Sthapit, Purnima Rajkarnikar; Gurung, Hom Bahadur; Saiju, Rohit",Nepalese journal of ophthalmology : a biannual peer-reviewed academic journal of the Nepal Ophthalmic Society : NEPJOPH,https://doi.org/10.3126/nepjoph.v13i1.30589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33981096/,247

Eight accessory proteins of SARS coronavirus were the suspected players in the pathogenesis of the virus. Among them, protein 3b localizes to the nucleus and behaves as an interferon antagonist by inhibiting IRF3 activation. However, the effect of 3b on the activity of other common host transcription factors remains unexplored. In this work, we studied the effect of 3b on the transcriptional activity of AP-1. Our findings elucidate augmentation of AP-1-dependent gene expression in 3b-transfected Huh7 cells. Reporter gene and mobility shift assays depict an increase in the AP-1 transcriptional and DNA binding activity in the presence of 3b. This increase in activity correlates with the activation of ERK and JNK pathways. Furthermore, 3b expression potentiates AP-1-driven promoter activity of proinflammatory cytokine MCP-1, suggesting a plausible role for 3b as a virulence factor that might function by upregulating AP-1-dependent cytokine levels in SARS-CoV infection.","Varshney, Bhavna; Lal, Sunil K",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bi200303r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21561061/,247

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 342 consecutive carotid artery lesions in 319 patients who underwent carotid artery stenting between April 2008 and April 2015. After excluding cases with carotid artery dissection and acute occlusion, 301 lesions in total of 277 patients were included in the analysis. We examined the association between in-stent protrusion, which was detected by intravascular ultrasound, and postoperative ipsilateral stroke within 30 days. RESULTS In-stent protrusion was observed in 47 (15.6%) lesions, of which postoperative ipsilateral stroke within 30 days occurred with 4 (8.5%) lesions. All these events occurred within 10 days after treatment. On the other hand, only 1 (0.39%) of the 256 lesions without in-stent protrusion showed this symptom, and the event occurred at 30days after treatment. Thus, lesions with in-stent protrusion had a higher cumulative risk of ipsilateral stroke than those without in-stent protrusion (8.5% vs 0.4% at 30 days, log-rank P < 0.001). In-stent protrusion, which was more often seen in symptomatic lesions, was associated with a vulnerable plaque assessed by MRI. After adjustment for postoperative stroke risks such as symptomatic lesions, plaque vulnerability, age or sex, in-stent protrusion was still significantly associated with postoperative ipsilateral stroke within 30 days (OR = 27.03, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Postoperative ipsilateral stroke was observed more frequently in patients with demonstrated in-stent protrusion (ISP) following CAS.","Beppu, Mikiya; Mineharu, Yohei; Imamura, Hirotoshi; Adachi, Hidemitsu; Sakai, Chiaki; Tani, Shoichi; Arimura, Koichi; Tokunaga, So; Sakai, Nobuyuki",Journal of neuroradiology.

A Critical Appraisal of the Literature.,2021-06-15,"INTRODUCTION Reduced-port laparoscopic surgery is a novel minimally invasive surgery. However, reduced-port surgery for ulcerative colitis (UC) remains controversial. Here, we describe the clinical outcomes of single-incision plus one port laparoscopic surgery (SILS + 1) for medically uncontrolled UC. METHODS Between May 2011 and September 2014, 10 UC patients underwent SILS + 1 port surgery. All procedures were performed with the use of a SILS port and either a 5-mm or a 12-mm port placed at the planned ileostomy site. RESULTS The median age of patients was 32 years (range, 22-53 years). Six patients underwent two-stage SILS + 1 port restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, two patients underwent SILS + 1 total proctocolectomy, and the remaining two patients underwent SILS + 1 subtotal colectomy with subsequent three-stage SILS + 1 ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. The median operative time was 363.1 min (range, 253-465 min) and the median estimated blood loss was 29 mL (range, 0-100 mL). There were no conversions or additional ports required. Two patients previously underwent SILS + 1 subtotal colectomy, and in one of those patients, SILS + 1 ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was performed successfully 6 months after the previous surgery. There were no intra-abdominal adhesions, and no extra wounds were necessary because the previous stoma site had been used to access the SILS port. The median postoperative period was 24 months, during which five patients had their ileostomies closed. No patients reported occasional minor daily soiling or the need to wear a pad. CONCLUSION Reduced-port laparoscopic surgery for medically uncontrolled UC is a feasible and safe procedure when performed by skilled surgeons.","Homma, Shigenori; Kawamata, Futoshi; Shibasaki, Susumu; Kawamura, Hideki; Takahashi, Norihiko; Taketomi, Akinobu",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26490730/,247

The research employed qualitative research methods; participant observation and in-depth ethnographic interviews of community members, traditional healers, and nurses. The study found that: traditional medicines are widely used in Qokolweni due to accessibility and long-built trust; the practice is broad and not certified. To achieve the integration of traditional medicine into the conventional health systems, the central government needs to show political will by setting up regulatory strategies that provide for the scientific evaluation and certification of traditional medicines.

Nasopharyngeal swabs were randomly collected from steers ( n = 23) and assessed for the presence of infectious agents of BRD by PCR and/or RT-PCR assays. These included: Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma bovis, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3). Pulmonary sections of one steer that died with clinical BRD were submitted for pathology and molecular testing. The frequencies of the pathogens identified from the nasopharyngeal swabs were: H. somni 39% (9 of 23), BRSV 35% (8 of 23), BCoV 22% (5 of 23), and M. haemolytica 13% (3 of 23). PCR or RT-PCR assays did not identify P. multocida, M. bovis, BoHV-1, BVDV, or BPIV-3 from the nasopharyngeal swabs. Single and concomitant associations of infectious agents of BRD were identified. Fibrinous bronchopneumonia was diagnosed in one steer that died; samples were positive for H. somni and M. haemolytica by PCR.

METHODS Patients under combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) with fully suppressed HIV plasma viral load (pVL) >24 months-whereof >6 months on an NVP- containing regimen-were switched to oral NVP plus 3TC for 24 weeks. Patients could then decide whether to continue DT or return to the previous cART. HIV pVL was monitored monthly until week 144. The primary outcome was confirmed viral failure (RNA >100 copies/ml). Low-level detection of HIV-RNA in plasma was compared in each patient with pre-study viral load measurements. RESULTS Twenty patients were included, switched to DT and all completed week 24. One patient decided thereafter to discontinue study participation for personal reasons. After a total of 144 observation weeks, none of the patients failed. The frequency of low- level HIV-RNA detection was not different from the period before randomization. CONCLUSIONS Our findings are surprising but given the nature of a proof-of-concept study, the results do not support the use of this dual regimen. However, as this dual HIV maintenance strategy was feasible and effective, over a period of 144 weeks, we suggest NVP plus 3TC warrants further evaluation as potential maintenance option in patients tolerating nevirapine.

One application of PEDs that is not well described in the literature is the utility and long-term safety in treatment of vertebrobasilar fusiform (VBF) aneurysms. Despite the advancements in endovascular therapy, VBF aneurysms continue to challenging pathology. The authors provide long-term follow-up of VBF aneurysms treated with PEDs. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed four patients that were treated at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in Shreveport with PEDs for VBFs from 2012 to 2014. Each patient was discussed in a multidisciplinary setting between neurosurgeons and neurointerventionalists. Each patient underwent platelet function tests to ensure responsiveness to anti-platelet agents and was treated by one neurointerventionalist (HC). All patients were placed on aspirin and Plavix and were confirmed for therapeutic response prior to discharge. RESULTS Follow-up ranged from 12 to 25 months, with a mean of 14.25 months. Two cases presented with a recurrence after the initial treatment, both of which required subsequent treatment. Of the four patients treated, one patient developed hemiparesis and three died. CONCLUSION Despite reports describing successful treatment of VBF aneurysms with PEDs, delayed complications after obliteration and remodeling can occur. We describe our institutional experience of VBFs treated with PEDs. Treatment of holobasilar fusiform aneurysms may carry a worse prognosis after treatment. Further long-term follow-up will provide a better understanding of this pathology.","Ahmed, Osama; Storey, Christopher; Kalakoti, Piyush; Deep Thakur, Jai; Zhang, Shihao; Nanda, Anil; Guthikonda, Bharat; Cuellar, Hugo","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019915590068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26089246/,247

In addition, we explored the feasibility of using NIR and Raman spectra as a surrogate measurement of physiochemical properties in prediction of performance in tablet direct compression. Partial least square models to predict PAs from MgSt properties or spectra were developed and validated. The model input variables are MgSt physiochemical properties spectra and key formulation and process parameters. Material properties include fatty acid composition, loss on drying, densities, particle size distribution, specific surface area, and solid state properties. The parameters include MgSt concentration, filler type and compression force. The output variables are performance attributes (PAs) including tablet ejection force, breaking force and disintegration time. It was found that the prediction of MgSt performance from its properties greatly depends on filler type and PAs of interest. NIR spectra successfully predicted lubricant performance in lactose tablet; however, predictions from Raman spectra were not acceptable. In the cases that the contributing physiochemical properties in performance prediction are sufficiently captured in the spectra, the spectra can be used as an alternative tool to predict excipient performance.","Wang, Ting; Ibrahim, Ahmed; Hoag, Stephen W",Pharmaceutical development and technology,https://doi.org/10.1080/10837450.2019.1673774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556338/,247

While surgical treatments, particularly laparoscopic pyloroplasty, have recently gained popularity, they require general anesthesia, advanced skills, and can lead to leaks. Peroral pyloromyotomy is a less invasive alternative; however, this technique is technically demanding and not widely available. We describe a hybrid laparo-endoscopic collaborative approach using a novel gastric access device to allow endoluminal stapled pyloroplasty as an alternative treatment option for gastric outlet obstruction. METHODS Under general anesthesia, six pigs (mean weight 33 kg) underwent endoscopic placement of intragastric ports using a technique similar to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. A 5 mm laparoscope was used for visualization. A functional lumen imagine probe was used to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) and diameter of the pylorus before, after, and at 1 week after intervention. Pyloroplasty was performed using a 5 mm articulating laparoscopic stapler. Gastrotomies were closed by endoscopic clips, endoscopic suture, or combination. After 6-8 days, a second evaluation was performed. At the end of the protocol, all animals were euthanized. RESULTS Six pyloroplasties were performed. In all cases, this technique was effective in achieving significant pyloric dilatation. The median pre-pyloroplasty pyloric diameter (D) and cross-sectional area (CSA) were 8 mm (4.9-11.6 mm) and 58.6 mm2 (19-107 mm2), respectively. After the procedure, these values increased to 13.41 mm (9.8-17.6 mm) and 147.7 mm2 (76-244 mm2), respectively (p = 0.0152). No important intraoperative events were observed. Postoperatively, all animals did well, with adequate oral intake and no relevant complications. At follow-up endoscopy, all incisions were healed and the pylorus widely patent. CONCLUSIONS Hybrid endoluminal stapled pyloroplasty is a feasible, safe, and effective alternative method for the treatment of gastric outlet obstruction syndrome.","Gonzalez, Cristians; Kwak, Jung-Myun; Davrieux, Federico; Watanabe, Ryohei; Marescaux, Jacques; Swanstrom, Lee",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6493-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30334156/,247
139427,Poor preoperative sleep quality is a risk factor for severe postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery: A prospective cohort study.,2019,"Reactive poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate) (PPFPA) grafted surfaces offer a versatile platform to immobilize biomolecules. Here, we utilize PPFPA grafted surface and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) recognizing J2 antibody to construct a universal virus detection platform with enhanced sensitivity. PPFPA on silicon substrates are prepared, and surface hydrophilicity is modulated by partial substitution of the pentafluorophenyl units with poly(ethylene glycol). Following dsRNA antibody immobilization, the prepared surfaces can distinguish long dsRNAs from single-stranded RNAs of the same length and short dsRNAs. As long dsRNAs are common byproducts of viral transcription/replication, these surfaces can detect the presence of different kinds of viruses without prior knowledge of their genomic sequences. To increase dsRNA detection sensitivity, a two-step method is devised where the captured dsRNAs are visualized with multiple fluorophore-tagged J2 antibodies. We show that the developed platform can differentiate foreign long dsRNAs from cellular dsRNAs and other biomolecules present in the cell lysate. Moreover, when tested against cells infected with hepatitis A or C viruses, both viruses are successfully detected using a single platform. Our study shows that the developed PPFPA platform immobilized with J2 antibody can serve as a primary diagnostic tool to determine the infection status for a wide range of viruses.","Ku, Jayoung; Kim, Sura; Park, Jaemin; Kim, Tae-Shin; Kharbash, Raisa; Shin, Eui-Cheol; Char, Kookheon; Kim, Yoosik; Li, Sheng",Biomacromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c00379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32233463/,247

As the principal constituents of innate immunity, both type I and III IFNs share antiviral features. However, important properties, including preferential expression at mucosal barriers (such as respiratory tract), local influences, lower receptor distribution, smaller target cell types, noninflammatory effects, and immunomodulatory impacts, were attributed only to type III IFNs. Accordingly, type III IFNs can establish an optimal effective antiviral response, without triggering exaggerated systemic inflammation that is generally attributed to the type I IFNs. However, some harmful effects were attributed to the III IFNs and there are also major differences between human and mouse concerning the immunomodulatory effects of III IFNs. Here, we describe the differential properties of type I and type III IFNs and present a model of IFN response during SARS-COV-2 infection, while highlighting the superior potential of type III IFNs in COVID-19.","Jafarzadeh, Abdollah; Nemati, Maryam; Saha, Bhaskar; Bansode, Yashwant D; Jafarzadeh, Sara",Viral immunology,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2020.0076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33147113/,247

Here we evaluate whether a common songbird responsively exploited newly emptied acoustic space by comparing soundscapes and songs across the San Francisco Bay Area prior to and during the recent statewide shutdown. We show that noise levels in urban areas were dramatically lower during the shutdown, characteristic of traffic in the mid-1950s. We also show that birds responded by producing higher performance songs at lower amplitudes, effectively maximizing communication distance and salience. These findings illustrate that behavioral traits can change rapidly in response to newly favorable conditions, indicating an inherent resilience to long-standing anthropogenic pressures like noise pollution.","Derryberry, Elizabeth P; Phillips, Jennifer N; Derryberry, Graham E; Blum, Michael J; Luther, David",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abd5777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32972991/,247

141303,Reopening schools safely in the face of COVID-19: Can cluster randomized trials help?,2021-01-21,"Municipal waste disposal behaviors in Regina, the capital city of Saskatchewan, Canada have significantly changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. About 7.5 year of waste disposal data at the Regina landfill was collected, verified, and consolidated. Four modeling approaches were examined to predict total waste disposal at the Regina landfill during the COVID-19 period, including (i) continuous total (Baseline), (ii) continuous fraction, (iii) truncated total, and (iv) truncated fraction. A single feature input recurrent neural network model was adopted for each approach. It is hypothesized that waste quantity modeling using different waste fractions and separate time series can better capture disposal behaviors of residents during the lockdown. Compared to the baseline approach, the use of waste fractions in modeling improves both result accuracy and precision. In general, the use of continuous time series over-predicted total waste disposal, especially when actual disposal rates were less than 50 t/day. Compared to the baseline approach, mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean square error (MSE) were reduced. The R value increased from 0.63 to 0.79. Comparing to the baseline, the truncated total and the truncated fraction approaches better captured the total waste disposal behaviors during the COVID-19 period, probably due to the periodicity of the weeklong data set. For both approaches, MAE and MAPE were lower than 70 and 22%, respectively. The model performance of the truncated fraction appears the best, with an MAPE of 19.8% and R value of 0.92. Results suggest the uses of waste fractions and separated time series are beneficial, especially if the input set is heavily skewed.","Vu, Hoang Lan; Ng, Kelvin Tsun Wai; Richter, Amy; Karimi, Nima; Kabir, Golam",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082208/,247

METHODS We reviewed the cancer tracking database of the largest cancer center in southern Brasil and performed statistical tests to compare first-time appointments from the onset of the outbreak until the end of June to those of the equivalent period in 2019. RESULTS We observed a dramatic reduction (-42%) in first-time appointments during the pandemic compared to the same period in the previous year (P <0.001). This reduction was observed among all medical specialties (P <0.001). CONCLUSION The onset of COVID-19 was correlated with a reduction in admission to a high-complexity cancer care center in Brasil. Since a delay in diagnosis and treatment may influence prognosis, it is important that cancer centers and public health strategies reinforce care for non-COVID-19 patients to prevent potentially unnecessary deaths.","Nabhen, Jacqueline Justino; Ostroski, Tayza Katelline Danilau; Kozonoe, Milena Massumi; Orlandi, Dinarte; Tormen, Tiago; Ioshii, Sérgio Ossamu",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.10.1361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33174927/,247

144390,Smell recovery in patients with COVID-19: an experience with nebulized nasal treatment.,2021-03-17,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the progenitor cells that give rise to the diverse repertoire of all immune cells. As they differentiate, HSCs yield a series of cell states that undergo gradual commitment to become mature blood cells. Studies of hematopoiesis in murine models have provided critical insights about the lineage relationships between stem cells, progenitors, and mature cells and these have guided investigations of the molecular basis for these distinct developmental stages. Primary immune deficiencies are caused by inborn errors of immunity that result in immune dysfunction and subsequent susceptibility to severe and recurrent infection(s). Over the last decade there has been a dramatic increase in the number and depth of the molecular, cellular and clinical characterization of such genetically defined causes of immune dysfunction. Patients harboring inborn errors of immunity thus represent a unique resource to improve our understanding of the multi-layered and complex mechanisms underlying lymphocyte development in humans. These breakthrough discoveries not only enable significant advances in the diagnosis of such rare and complex conditions but also provide substantial improvement in the development of personalized treatments. Here, we will discuss the clinical, cellular and molecular phenotypes and treatments of selected inborn errors of immunity that impede, either intrinsically or extrinsically, the development of B- or T-cells at different stages. © AlphaMed Press 2021 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Hematopoietic stem cells are critical for lifelong production of blood cells. HSCs are distinctively defined by their self-renewal capacity while contributing to the pool of differentiating cells (ie, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages) that ensure immune regulation and protective immunity against pathogen infection. Here, we discuss how the comprehensive study of a growing number of patients harboring rare germline genetic defects that result in immune dysfunctions and increased susceptibility to infectious disease (collectively named primary immunodeficiencies), have enabled a better understanding of the intricate process of lymphocyte development in human, improved diagnosis and facilitated the development of curative rather than supportive treatments for patients with primary immunodeficiencies.","Della Mina, Erika; Guérin, Antoine; Tangye, Stuart G",Stem cells,https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.3327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400834/,247

Extensive atrial tissue fibrosis identified by delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with poor outcomes of AF catheter ablation. OBJECTIVE To characterize the feasibility of atrial tissue fibrosis estimation by delayed enhancement MRI and its association with subsequent AF ablation outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study of patients diagnosed with paroxysmal and persistent AF (undergoing their first catheter ablation) conducted between August 2010 and August 2011 at 15 centers in the United States, Europe, and Australia. Delayed enhancement MRI images were obtained up to 30 days before ablation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Fibrosis quantification was performed at a core laboratory blinded to the participating center, ablation approach, and procedure outcome. Fibrosis blinded to the treating physicians was categorized as stage 1 (<10% of the atrial wall), 2 (≥10%-<20%), 3 (≥20%-<30%), and 4 (≥30%). Patients were followed up for recurrent arrhythmia per current guidelines using electrocardiography or ambulatory monitor recording and results were analyzed at a core laboratory. Cumulative incidence of recurrence was estimated by stage at days 325 and 475 after a 90-day blanking period (standard time allowed for arrhythmias related to ablation-induced inflammation to subside) and the risk of recurrence was estimated (adjusting for 10 demographic and clinical covariates). RESULTS Atrial tissue fibrosis estimation by delayed enhancement MRI was successfully quantified in 272 of 329 enrolled patients (57 patients [17%] were excluded due to poor MRI quality). There were 260 patients who were followed up after the blanking period (mean [SD] age of 59.1 [10.7] years, 31.5% female, 64.6% with paroxysmal AF). For recurrent arrhythmia, the unadjusted overall hazard ratio per 1% increase in left atrial fibrosis was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03-1.08; P < .001). Estimated unadjusted cumulative incidence of recurrent arrhythmia by day 325 for stage 1 fibrosis was 15.3% (95% CI, 7.6%-29.6%); stage 2, 32.6% (95% CI, 24.3%-42.9%); stage 3, 45.9% (95% CI, 35.5%-57.5%); and stage 4, 51.1% (95% CI, 32.8%-72.2%) and by day 475 was 15.3% (95% CI, 7.6%-29.6%), 35.8% (95% CI, 26.2%-47.6%), 45.9% (95% CI, 35.6%-57.5%), and 69.4% (95% CI, 48.6%-87.7%), respectively. Similar results were obtained after covariate adjustment. The addition of fibrosis to a recurrence prediction model that includes traditional clinical covariates resulted in an improved predictive accuracy with the C statistic increasing from 0.65 to 0.69 (risk difference of 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.09). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with AF undergoing catheter ablation, atrial tissue fibrosis estimated by delayed enhancement MRI was independently associated with likelihood of recurrent arrhythmia. The clinical implications of this association warrant further investigation.","Marrouche, Nassir F; Wilber, David; Hindricks, Gerhard; Jais, Pierre; Akoum, Nazem; Marchlinski, Francis; Kholmovski, Eugene; Burgon, Nathan; Hu, Nan; Mont, Lluis; Deneke, Thomas; Duytschaever, Mattias; Neumann, Thomas; Mansour, Moussa; Mahnkopf, Christian; Herweg, Bengt; Daoud, Emile; Wissner, Erik; Bansmann, Paul; Brachmann, Johannes",JAMA,https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2014.3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496537/,247

We conducted a matched retrospective cohort study to compare clinical outcomes among SOT recipients with the general population and to assess immunosuppression management. METHODS Adult SOT recipients with laboratory PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a tertiary-care hospital in Barcelona, Spain, from March 11th to April 25th 2020, were matched to controls (1:4) on the basis of sex, age and age-adjusted Charlson's Index. Patients were followed for up to 28 days from admission or until censored. Primary endpoint was mortality at 28 days. Secondary endpoints included admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and secondary complications. Drug-drug interactions (DDI) between immunosuppressants and COVID-19 management medication were collected. RESULTS Forty-six transplant recipients and 166 control patients were included. Mean (SD) age of transplant recipients and controls was 62.7 (12.6) and 66.0 (12.7) years, 33 (71.7%) and 122 (73.5%) were male, and median (IQR) Charlson's Index was 5 (3-7) and 4 (2-7), respectively. Mortality was 37.0% in SOT recipients and 22.9% in controls (p=0.51).Thirty-three (71.7%) patients underwent transitory discontinuation of immunosuppressants due to potential or confirmed DDI. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, hospitalized SOT recipients with COVID-19 had a trend toward higher mortality compared to controls, although it was not statistically significant, and a notable propensity for DDI.","Miarons, Marta; Larrosa-García, María; García-García, Sonia; Los-Arcos, Ibai; Moreso, Francesc; Berastegui, Cristina; Castells, Lluís; Pérez-Hoyos, Santiago; Varela, Javier; Pau-Parra, Alba; Varón-Galcera, Carlota; Parramon-Teixidó, Carlos-Javier; Martínez-Casanova, Javier; Domènech, Laura; García-Ortega, Patricia; Sánchez-Sancho, Pablo; Alonso-Martínez, Carla; Gómez-Ganda, Laura; Roch-Santed, Maria; Gracia-Moya, Ariadna; Del-Rio-Gutiérrez, José-Manuel; Guillén-Del-Castillo, Alfredo; Sans-Pola, Carla; Antón, Andrés; Montoro, Bruno; Gorgas-Torner, Maria-Queralt",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941394/,247

Treatments include intravitreal injections, laser photocoagulation and vitrectomy, which are all invasive options. In order to prevent or delay DR, it is important to investigate earlier, non-invasive managements prior to sight-threatening DR. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of systemic treatment on incident and progressive DR. The search in this systematic review was performed in PubMed and Embase using the keywords 'diabetic retinopathy' AND 'systemic therapy'. Two independent researchers identified 619 studies; 26 duplicates were removed, 579 articles were excluded based on title and abstract, and six were removed after full-text assessment. Five articles were added from reference screening, resolving in a total of 13 eligible articles. These were quality-assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Twelve randomized control trials and one follow-up study were included. Intensive glycaemic control (IGC), antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatments were some of the main interventions tested in the studies. Three studies found statistically significant reduction of progression of DR by IGC, three by antihypertensive, and two by the lipid-lowering drug fenofibrate. Systemic intervention appears important in different stages of DR. While IGC seems effective in relation to incident and progressive DR, antihypertensive treatments may be valuable in the early stages of DR, as opposed to fenofibrate, which could benefit at a later stage.","Elkjaer, Anna Sofie; Lynge, Sidsel Kirstine; Grauslund, Jakob",Acta ophthalmologica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.14377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32100477/,247

We studied the association of GM diversity and composition, plasma metabolites, predicted functional metagenomics and steatosis. Approach & Results This is a cross-sectional analysis of the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study. We used 16Sribosomal-RNA gene sequencing and determined taxonomy using the Silva-reference database. Alpha-and beta-diversity were calculated using Shannon-index and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities. Differences were tested across steatosis using PerMANOVA. Hepatic steatosis was diagnosed by ultrasonography. We subsequently selected genera using regularized regression. The functional metagenome was predicted based on the GM using KEGG-pathways. Serum metabolomics were assessed using high-throughput proton nuclear magnetic resonance. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, alcohol, diet, and proton-pump inhibitors. We included 1355 participants of which 472 had steatosis. Alpha-diversity was lower in steatosis (P=1.1∙10-9 ) and beta-diversity varied across steatosis strata (P=0.001). Lasso selected 37 genera of which three remained significantly associated after adjustment (Coprococcus3: β=-65; Ruminococcus Gauvreauiigroup: β=62; and Ruminococcus Gnavusgroup: β=45, Q-value =0.037). Predicted metagenome analyses revealed that pathways of secondary bile-acid synthesis and biotin metabolism were present and D-alanine metabolism was absent in steatosis. Metabolic profiles showed positive associations for aromatic-and branched chain amino acids and glycoprotein acetyls with steatosis and R. Gnavusgroup, whereas these metabolites were inversely associated with alpha-diversity and Coprococcus3. CONCLUSIONS We confirmed, for the first time on a large-scale, the lower microbial diversity and association of Coprococcus and Ruminococcus Gnavus with steatosis.

Methods Three patients with ACOM artery aneurysms, all previously treated with coiling and with recurrence of the aneurysm neck, were treated with the PED. All obtained follow-up diagnostic cerebral angiograms at either 3 or 6 months. Results Mean age of patients was 59 years. All patients received cerebral angiograms at a minimum of 3 months after treatment with the PED. Follow-up angiography was performed up to a mean of 10 months at which time point all cases demonstrated complete aneurysm occlusion, without any stenosis in the parent artery. Conclusion The PED can be safely used for the treatment of ACOM artery aneurysms. Complete aneurysm obliteration can be achieved in cases refractory to endovascular coiling. These findings warrant replication in a larger data set.","Sultan-Qurraie, Ali; Sattar, Ahsan; Wazni, Wled; Noufal, Mazen; Zaidat, Osama",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000456552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29118789/,247

148690,Schiavonia Hospital response to COVID-19 outbreak: a first single-center experience.,2020,"BACKGROUND Sore throat is a remarkable complication after thyroid surgery with endotracheal tube (ETT). Many studies revealed that laryngeal mask airway (LMA) might reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat. However, little is known about the use of a flexible reinforced LMA (FLMA) in thyroid surgery. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential benefits of FLMA compared with ETT on postoperative sore throat. METHODS In this prospective, single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, ninety-six patients aged 20-80 years, scheduled for elective radical thyroidectomy under general anesthesia were enrolled. They were randomly divided into ETT group and FLMA group. All the included patients received total intravenous anesthesia (with propofol, fentanyl and rocuronium) and controlled mechanical ventilation during the surgery. Cuff pressure of ETT and FLMA were strictly controlled. Incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat, numbness and hoarseness at 1, 24, and 48 h after surgery was evaluated and compared between the two groups. Incidence and severity of buckling during extubation and the hemodynamic profile during intubation were also recorded and compared. RESULTS The incidence of sore throat and hoarseness was significantly lower in FLMA group than those in ETT group at 1 h, 24 h and 48 h postoperatively, as well as the severity of sore throat. Compared to ETT group, there was a significantly lower incidence of buckling during extubation and less fluctuation of HR and BP at 1 min and 3 min after intubation in FLMA group. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing thyroid surgery with FLMA had less postoperative laryngopharyngeal symptoms when compared with ETT. The use of FLMA also achieved less buckling during extubation and better hemodynamic profiles during intubation.

149816,Correction to: Stroke Fellow Redeployed: My Fellowship in COVID in the Epicenter of a Pandemic.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND The Gouqi-wentang formula (GQWTF) is a herbal formula used by Academician Xiao-lin Tong for the clinical treatment of T2DM. GQWTF is beneficial to qi, nourishes Yin, clears heat, and promotes fluid production, but the effective components and their mechanism of action remain unclear. METHODS The main components of GQWTF were detected by LC-MS, and the multi-target mechanisms of GQWTF in T2DM were elucidated using network pharmacology analysis, including target prediction, protein-protein interaction network construction and analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation, and other network construction. Finally, the efficacy of the GQWTF was verified using biological experiments. RESULTS First, the ""herb-channel tropism"" network suggested that GQWTF focuses more on treating diseases by recuperating the liver, which is considered as an important insulin-sensitive organ. Subsequently, a total of 16 active ingredients in GQWTF were detected and screened, and their biological targets were predicted. Then, ""compound-target"" network was constructed, where enrichment analysis of GQWTF targets reflected its potential pharmacological activities. After T2DM-related target identification, 39 cross targets of GQWTF and T2DM were obtained, and 30 key targets highly responsible for the beneficial effect of GQWTF on T2DM were identified by PPI analysis. GO analysis of these key targets showed that many biological processes of GQWTF in treating T2DM are key in the occurrence and development of T2DM, including components related to inflammatory/immune response, insulin, and metabolism. KEGG analysis revealed the regulation of multiple signalling pathways, such as insulin resistance, PPAR signalling pathway, FoxO signalling pathway, Fc epsilon RI signalling pathway, and pathways that influence diabetes primarily by regulating metabolism as well as other T2DM directly related pathways. Furthermore, a ""formula-compound-pathway-symptom"" network was constructed to represent a global view of GQWTF in the treatment of T2DM. CONCLUSIONS This study explored the mechanism of action of GQWTF in T2DM by multi-component and multi-target multi pathways, which could provide a theoretical basis for the development and clinical application of GQWTF.","Han, Lin; Yang, Hao-Yu; Zheng, Yu-Jiao; Wei, Xiu-Xiu; Dan, Wen-Chao; Zhang, Li-Li; Ding, Qi-You; Ma, Xu; Wang, Xin-Miao; Zhao, Lin-Hua; Tong, Xiao-Lin",Chinese medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13020-021-00479-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579756/,247

METHODS Medline was searched for English-language randomized clinical trials between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018. Randomized clinical trials were eligible if the primary goal was to provide rehabilitation services to targeted patient populations. Two authors independently screened and extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of eligible trials. Descriptive analysis was used to compare service descriptions between eligible trials and the ICSO-R 2.0 framework (23 categories, 9 categories for provider, 14 categories for delivery). RESULTS Twenty-nine randomized clinical trials, with a wide range of organizational units and target groups, were included. The median number of categories reported in the provider dimension was 4 (range 3-5). The median number of categories reported in the service delivery dimension was 8 (range 6-12). None of the randomized clinical trials described all ICSO-R recommended categories. CONCLUSION Descriptions of service organization in rehabilitation varied widely among recently published randomized clinical trials. Use of the framework for the classification of service organization and standardization of description of services is recommended in future randomized clinical trials, to facilitate better comparisons in service research across studies.","Andelic, Nada; Lu, Juan; Gutenbrunner, Christoph; Nugraha, Boya; Gormley, Mirinda; Søberg, Helene L; Sveen, Unni; Anke, Audny; Kirkevold, Marit; Røe, Cecilie",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,https://doi.org/10.2340/16501977-2726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830278/,247

151603,[Current issues in the rehabilitation of stroke patients against the background of a new coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Resolution of the Council of Experts].,2020,"AIM Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (P-RFA) therapy is a widely applied treatment for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, local recurrence is a major issue of HCC located at the surface of the liver (surface HCC). The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of laparoscopic hepatic resection (LH) and P-RFA for surface HCC in case-control patient groups using the propensity score. METHODS Between 2011 and 2013, 40 and 52 patients underwent LH and P-RFA for surface HCC (≤3 cm, 1-3 nodules). To correct the difference in clinicopathological factors between the two groups, propensity score matching was used at a 1:1 ratio, which resulted in a comparison of 27 patients/group. We compared outcomes between the two groups, with special reference to local recurrence. RESULTS Clinicopathological variables were well balanced between the two groups. One patient in the LH group was converted to open surgery due to adhesion. The incidence of complications was 0% in the P-RFA group and 15% (four patients) in the LH group (P = 0.11); however, none of these four patients in the LH group sustained severe complications. The duration of hospitalization following treatment was longer in the LH group than in the P-RFA group (12.6 vs 7.6 days, P < 0.01). The incidence of local recurrence was lower in the LH group (0%) than in the P-RFA group (eight patients [30%], P = 0.004).

151907,Integrating New Staff into Endovascular Stroke-Treatment Workflows in the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-10-08,"BACKGROUND Chest radiography is often used to detect lung involvement in patients with suspected pneumonia. Chest radiography through glass walls of an isolation room is a technique that could be immensely useful in the current COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to ensure quality and radiation safety while acquiring portable chest radiographs through the glass doors of isolation rooms using an adult anthropomorphic thorax phantom. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixteen chest radiographs were acquired utilizing different exposure factors without glass, through the smart glass, and through regular glass. Images were scored independently by 2 radiologists for quantum mottle and sharpness of anatomical structures using a 5-point Likert scale. Statistically significant differences in Likert scale scores and entrance surface dose (ESD) between images acquired without glass and through the smart and regular glass were tested. Interreader reliability was also evaluated. RESULTS Compared with conventional radiography, equal or higher mean image quality scores (mottle and anatomical structures) were observed with the smart glass using 100 kVp at 12 mAs and 20 mAs and 125 kVp at 6.3 mAs (100 kVp at 2 mAs and 125 kVp at 3.2 mAs were used for conventional radiography observations). There was no statistically significant difference in the Likert scale scores for image quality and the entrance surface dose for radiographs acquired without glass, through the smart glass, and through regular glass. Backscatter from the smart glass was minimal at a distance of 3 m and was recorded as zero at a distance of 4 m from the x-ray tube outside an isolation room. CONCLUSIONS Good-quality portable chest radiographs can be obtained safely through the smart glass doors of the isolation room. However, this technique does result in minor backscatter radiation. Modifications in the exposure factors (such as increasing milliampere seconds) may be required to optimize image quality while using this technique.","Rai, Archana; MacGregor, Kate; Hunt, Bryce; Gontar, Alex; Ditkofsky, Noah; Deva, Djeven; Mathur, Shobhit",Investigative radiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0000000000000716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32773486/,247

153301,[Observation of therapeutic effect on coronavirus disease 2019 with insomnia in treatment with baduanjin and auricular point sticking therapy].,2021-03-12,"BACKGROUND Sepsis often accompanies gastrointestinal motility disorder that contributes to the development of sepsis in turn. Propofol and dexmedetomidine, as widely used sedatives in patients with sepsis, are likely to depress gastrointestinal peristalsis. We queried whether propofol or dexmedetomidine, at sedative doses, aggravated sepsis-induced ileus. METHODS Sedative/Anesthetic Scores and vital signs of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemic mice were measured during sedation with propofol or dexmedetomidine. Endotoxemic mice were divided into 10% fat emulsion, propofol, saline, and dexmedetomidine group. The gastric emptying, small intestinal transit, tests of colonic motility, gastrointestinal transit and whole gut transit were evaluated at 15 mins and 24 h after intraperitoneal injection of sedatives/vehicles respectively. RESULTS 40 mg·kg- 1propofol and 80 μg·kg- 1 dexmedetomidine induced a similar depth of sedation with comparable vital signs except that dexmedetomidine strikingly decreased heart rate in endotoxemic mice. Dexmedetomidine markedly inhibited gastric emptying (P = 0.006), small intestinal transit (P = 0.006), colonic transit (P = 0.0006), gastrointestinal transit (P = 0.0001) and the whole gut transit (P = 0.034) compared with the vehicle, whereas propofol showed no depression on all parts of gastrointestinal motility 15 mins after administration. The inhibitive effects of dexmedetomidine in these tests vanished 24 h after the administration. CONCLUSIONS Deep sedation with dexmedetomidine, but not propofol, significantly inhibited gastrointestinal peristalsis in endotoxemic mice while the inhibitory effect disappeared 24 h after sedation. These data suggested that both propofol and dexmedetomidine could be applied in septic patients while dexmedetomidine should be used cautiously in patients with cardiac disease or ileus.","Chang, Haiqing; Li, Shuang; Li, Yansong; Hu, Hao; Cheng, Bo; Miao, Jiwen; Gao, Hui; Ma, Hongli; Gao, Yanfeng; Wang, Qiang",BMC anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-020-01146-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894042/,247

153464,Are Cancer Patients at Higher Risk of Death With COVID-19?,2020-05-01,"African swine fever (ASF) is caused by ASF virus (ASFV) and is currently circulating in the eastern part of Europe posing a serious risk regarding transmission to western European countries. Wild boar is a main driver of the transmission and persistence of ASFV in the endemic infected countries in Europe. Some European countries free from ASF, such as Denmark and the Netherlands, have limited population sizes of wild boar, but have large swine productions. In these countries, the patterns of transmission and persistence of ASFV in the existing wild boar population, in case of introduction of ASFV, are unknown. It is important to get a better understanding of ASFV in these wild boar populations, in order to better manage the existing wild boar population and thereby minimize the risk of virus introduction and transmission to domestic pigs, in case of an ASFV incursion. We created an agent-based spatio-temporal model and simulated the transmission of ASFV within Danish wild boar populations, using actual landscape data. The model was run with 50 and 100 wild boar groups used as initial population sizes, respectively, either distributed across the southern part of the mainland (Jutland) or across both the southern and middle parts of Jutland, where wild boar groups are believed to exist. At first, the model was run without ASFV for 25 years to assess wild boar population dynamics in both regions. Thereafter, ASFV was added to the model 1 year after initiation and run for up to another 4 years. The model predicted that wild boar populations may increase drastically over the next 25 years, if wild boar groups were distributed across both southern and middle Jutland and no mitigation actions were taken, while the population sizes will be restricted, if groups were distributed only across the southern part of Jutland. The density of the population is an important factor affecting the transmission and persistency of the disease. Model results indicated that ASF epidemics in the simulated populations would generally persist for few months. However, due to the high stochasticity of the process, in certain situations the epidemics may last for more than one year, posing a serious risk of ASFV introduction to domestic pigs.","Halasa, Tariq; Boklund, Anette; Bøtner, Anette; Mortensen, Sten; Kjær, Lene Jung",Preventive veterinary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.03.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027724/,247

METHODS The gene expression omnibus (GEO) database was used to screen the whole genome expression data related with coronavirus infection. The R language package was used for differential expression analysis and KEGG/GO enrichment analysis. The core genes were screened by PPI network analysis using STRING online analysis website. Then the self-developed apparent precision therapy prediction platform (EpiMed) was used to analyze diseases, drugs and related target genes. RESULTS A database in accordance with the criteria was found, which was derived from SARS coronavirus. A total of 3606 differential genes were screened, including 2148 expression up-regulated genes and 1458 expression down-regulated genes. GO enrichment mainly related with viral infection, hematopoietic regulation, cell chemotaxis, platelet granule content secretion, immune activation, acute inflammation, etc. KEGG enrichment mainly related with hematopoietic function, coagulation cascade reaction, acute inflammation, immune reaction, etc. Ten core genes such as PTPRC, ICAM1, TIMP1, CXCR5, IL-1B, MYC, CR2, FSTL1, SOX1 and COL3A1 were screened by protein interaction network analysis. Ten drugs with potential intervention effects, including glucocorticoid, TNF-α inhibitor, salvia miltiorrhiza, sirolimus, licorice, red peony, famciclovir, cyclosporine A, houttuynia cordata, fluvastatin, etc. were screened by EpiMed plotform.

156503,The usefulness of echocardiography in the diagnosis of myocarditis in a young man after sudden cardiac arrest.,2021-03-06,"BACKGROUND Circulating SARS-CoV-2 RNA may represent a more reliable indicator of infection than nasal RNA, but RT-qPCR lacks diagnostic sensitivity for blood samples. METHODS A CRISPR-augmented RT-PCR assay that sensitively detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA was employed to analyze viral RNA kinetics in longitudinal plasma samples from nonhuman primates (NHP) after virus exposure; to evaluate the utility of blood SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection for COVID-19 diagnosis in adults cases confirmed by nasal/nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR results; and to identify suspected COVID-19 cases in pediatric and at-risk adult populations with negative nasal swab RT-qPCR results. All blood samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR to allow direct comparisons. RESULTS CRISPR-augmented RT-PCR consistently detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the plasma of experimentally infected NHPs from 1 to 28 days post-infection, and these increases preceded and correlated with rectal swab viral RNA increases. In a patient cohort (n=159), this blood-based assay demonstrated 91.2% diagnostic sensitivity and 99.2% diagnostic specificity versus a comparator RT-qPCR nasal/nasopharyngeal test, while RT-qPCR exhibited 44.1% diagnostic sensitivity and 100% specificity for the same blood samples. This CRISPR-augmented RT-PCR assay also accurately identified COVID-19 patients with one or more negative nasal swab RT-qPCR result. CONCLUSION Results of this study indicate that sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood by CRISPR-augmented RT-PCR permits accurate COVID-19 diagnosis, and can detect COVID-19 cases with transient or negative nasal swab RT-qPCR results, suggesting that this approach could improve COVID-19 diagnosis and the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 infection clearance, and predict the severity of infection.","Huang, Zhen; Ning, Bo; Yang, He S; Youngquist, Brady M; Niu, Alex; Lyon, Christopher J; Beddingfield, Brandon J; Fears, Alyssa C; Monk, Chandler H; Murrell, Amelie E; Bilton, Samantha J; Linhuber, Joshua P; Norton, Elizabeth B; Dietrich, Monika L; Yee, Jim K; Lai, Weihua; Scott, John W; Yin, Xiao-Ming; Rappaport, Jay; Robinson, James E; Saba, Nakhle S; Roy, Chad J; Zwezdaryk, Kevin J; Zhao, Zhen; Hu, Tony Y",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci146031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33561010/,247

157326,"Covid-19: Convalescent plasma may cut deaths in patients not on ventilation, study indicates.",2021-01-14,"Background The recent success of several mechanical thrombectomy trials has resulted in a significant change in the management of patients presenting with stroke. However, questions still remain as to whether certain groups will benefit from mechanical thrombectomy. In particular, it is still uncertain whether mechanical thrombectomy should be performed in the M2 branches and, more generally, in the distal vasculature. Methods We retrospectively analysed our prospectively maintained database of all patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy between January 2008 and August 2016. We collected demographic, radiological, procedural and outcome data. Results We identified 106 patients that met our inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was 68 ± 13.8 years, and there were 58 (54.7%) male patients. Associated medical conditions were common with hypertension seen in 71% of the patients. The average Alberta Stroke Program Early CT (ASPECT) score on admission was 8.5 ± 1.7. The mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 11.8 ± 7.02. The mean duration of the procedure was 103 ± 3.4 min, and the average number of thrombectomy attempts required was 1.8 (range 1-8). Angiographically, Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Scale (TICI) ≥2b was obtained in 90.5% of the patients. Five patients (4.7%) had symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage on follow-up. At 90-day follow-up, 54.6% of the patients had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2, and 71.5% had an mRS score ≤3. There were 15 deaths at 90 days (14.1%). Conclusion Mechanical thrombectomy in patients with solitary M2 clots is technically possible and carries a high degree of success with a good safety profile. Patients with confirmed M2 occlusion should be considered for mechanical thrombectomy.","Bhogal, Pervinder; Bücke, Philipp; Aguilar Pérez, Marta; Ganslandt, Oliver; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Henkes, Hans",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000458161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29118788/,247

However, the molecular interactions between virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells and inflammatory cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), have not been thoroughly characterized. Rat coronavirus (RCoV) is used as a model to study the immune response to viral infection in the lung of the natural host. We have developed an in vitro model to characterize the response of PMNs to RCoV-infected type I-like alveolar epithelial (AT1) cells, the primary target for RCoV infection in the alveoli. Multiple CXC chemokines that signal through CXCR2 were required for PMN chemotaxis toward medium from RCoV-infected AT1-like cells (RCoV-AT1). Furthermore, RCoV-AT1 inhibited spontaneous PMN apoptosis, including activation of effector caspase 3 and initiator caspases 8 and 9. Use of a selective inhibitor of CXCR2, SB265610, demonstrated that CXCR2 signaling was required for RCoV-AT1-mediated inhibition of PMN apoptosis. These data suggest that CXC chemokines produced by RCoV-infected AT1-like cells inhibit PMN apoptosis during infection. These studies provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms whereby alveolar epithelial cells direct the functions of PMNs during viral infection of the lung.","Rzepka, Joanna P; Haick, Anoria K; Miura, Tanya A",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2011-0230oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22312020/,247
157387,Body image concerns in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator: A scoping review.,2018,"BACKGROUND Mental and physical symptoms are common in paramedics, which may relate to high work stress, including critical incidents. As previous trauma is a risk factor for psychological symptoms after exposure to critical incidents, the prevalence of childhood experiences with abuse and neglect and paramedics' adaptation to critical incidents may be important. METHODS 635 paramedics were surveyed regarding childhood experiences of physical, sexual or emotional abuse as well an index critical incident from the past, acute stress responses to that event and current mental and physical symptoms. A comparison group of 159 female hospital-based healthcare workers completed the same survey of childhood abuse and neglect in a separate study. RESULTS 232 paramedics (36.5%) responded. Among these, physical, sexual or emotional childhood abuse was reported by 38.4%. Female paramedics reported significantly more emotional and physical abuse and neglect than female hospital workers. Paramedics who reported childhood abuse or neglect more frequently experienced signs of acute stress immediately following the index critical incident and for the following 2 weeks. Childhood abuse and neglect were associated with significantly higher scores for depressive symptoms, physical symptoms and burnout, and a higher prevalence of 'cases' scoring above thresholds of clinical significance. CONCLUSION Childhood abuse may be more common in paramedics than in other healthcare workers, at least in women. Childhood abuse and neglect is associated with acute stress responses to critical incidents and to current physical and mental symptoms. These results are based on a low response rate and may not be generalisable.","Maunder, Robert G; Halpern, Janice; Schwartz, Brian; Gurevich, Maria",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/emj.2010.099838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21422029/,247

However, it is not clear whether this CCN activation is associated with both information entropy representing the information conveyed by a sequence of events as the context and surprise value that quantifies the information conveyed by a specific type of event in the context, independent of input modality. We manipulated entropy and surprise in this functional magnetic resonance imaging study by varying the probability of occurrence of two types of events in both the visual and auditory modalities and measured brain response as a function of entropy and surprise. We found that activation in regions of the CCN increased as a function of entropy and surprise in both the visual and auditory modalities. The frontoparietal network and additional structures in the CCN mediated the relationship between these information measures and behavioral response. These results suggest that the CCN is a high-level modality-general neural entity for the control of the processing of information conveyed by both context and event.","Wu, Tingting; Schulz, Kurt P; Fan, Jin",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117703; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385564/,247

This study compares published outcomes between the ENT and NEU coil-assist systems and comments on the published safety and efficacy of stent-assisted coiling in general. METHODS A literature search was performed through PubMed for all published series of ENT or NEU stent-assisted coiling of cerebral aneurysms from 2004 to 2014. All studies including 10 or more published cases of stent-assisted coiling with ENT or NEU were included. RESULTS 47 studies met the inclusion criteria, containing 4238 aneurysms in 4039 patients. 2111 aneurysms were treated with NEU and 2127 were treated with ENT. Mean follow-up was 14.1 months. Overall, thromboembolic events occurred in 6.4% of aneurysms, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in 2.6%, permanent morbidity in 3.9%, and mortality in 2.3%. Initial and final 100% angiographic occlusion was seen in 53% and 69% of patients, respectively. Deployment failures (p<0.001), ICH (p=0.001), mortality among all patients (p=0.03), and recanalization (p=0.02) were more commonly reported in NEU treated aneurysms. The ENT system was also associated with higher reported complete occlusion at follow-up (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS This literature review represents the largest and most robust comparison of stent-assisted coiling devices to date, containing over 4200 aneurysms in more than 4000 patients. Comparative analyses demonstrate that both devices are reported to be safe and effective with comparable permanent morbidity.","King, Brent; Vaziri, Sasha; Singla, Amit; Fargen, Kyle M; Mocco, J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25352581/,247

Although many local EWS are in use in obstetrics, most have been developed heuristically. No current obstetric EWS has defined the thresholds at which an alert should be triggered using evidence-based normal ranges, nor do they reflect the changing physiology that occurs with gestation during pregnancy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS An observational cohort study involving 1000 participants across three UK sites in Oxford, London and Newcastle. Pregnant women will be recruited at approximately 14 weeks' gestation and have their vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and temperature) measured at 4 to 6-week intervals during pregnancy. Vital signs recorded during labour and delivery will be extracted from hospital records. After delivery, participants will measure and record their own vital signs daily for 2 weeks. During the antenatal and postnatal periods, vital signs will be recorded on an Android tablet computer through a custom software application and transferred via mobile internet connection to a secure database. The data collected will be used to define reference ranges of vital signs across normal pregnancy, labour and the immediate postnatal period. This will inform the design of an evidence-based obstetric EWS. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study has been approved by the NRES committee South East Coast-Brighton and Sussex (14/LO/1312) and is registered with the ISRCTN (10838017). All participants will provide written informed consent and can withdraw from the study at any point. All data collected will be managed anonymously. The findings will be disseminated in international peer-reviewed journals and through research conferences.","Kumar, Fiona; Kemp, Jude; Edwards, Clare; Pullon, Rebecca M; Loerup, Lise; Triantafyllidis, Andreas; Salvi, Dario; Gibson, Oliver; Gerry, Stephen; MacKillop, Lucy H; Tarassenko, Lionel; Watkinson, Peter J",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28864695/,247

Cross-linguistic analyses of alexias and agraphias are fundamental to understand commonalities and differences in the brain organization of written language. Few reports of alexias and agraphias in the Spanish language are currently available. AIMS To analyse the clinical manifestations of alexias and agraphias in Spanish, and the effect of demographic variables. METHODS & PROCEDURES Spanish versions of the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) and Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) were used for language assessment. Lesion localization was obtained by using computed axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The final sample included 200 patients: 195 (97.5%) right-handed and five (2.5%) left-handed; 119 men and 81 women with a mean age of 57.37 years (SD = 15.56), education of 13.52 years (SD = 4.08), and mean time post-onset of 6.58 months (SD = 12.94). Using the WAB, four quotients were calculated: aphasia quotient (AQ), reading-writing quotient (RWQ), language quotient (LQ) and cortical quotient (CQ). OUTCOMES & RESULTS The types of aphasia were: global = 11 patients (5.5%), Broca = 31 (15.5%), Wernicke = 30 (15.0%), conduction = 22 (11.0%), transcortical sensory = 17 (8.5%), transcortical motor = 3 (1.5%), amnesic or anomic = 54 (27.0%) and mixed non-fluent = 32 (16.0%). The degree of oral and written language impairment differed across the various aphasia types. Most severe reading and writing difficulties were found in global, mixed non-fluent and transcortical motor aphasia; fewer difficulties were observed in amnesic, Broca and conduction aphasia. The severity of the written language impairments paralleled the severity of the oral language disturbances. Age negatively, while schooling positively, correlated with the scores in reading and writing tests. No effect of sex and time since onset was found. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS In Spanish-speaking aphasia patients, difficulties in reading and writing are similar to oral language difficulties. This similarity of performance is mostly based on severity rather than the participants' patterns of errors. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject There is limited information about alexia and agraphia in Spanish.

The aim of this study was to describe a novel injection technique targeting trunks of BP and to determine the minimum effective local anaesthetic volume (MELAV) required to produce BP block with this approach. Methods Twenty-one male patients in the age group 20-40 years, undergoing elective forearm bony procedures received an ultrasound-guided truncal injection BP block. MELAV50 was determined using the Dixon and Mood up-and-down method. Initial volume of local anaesthetic (LA; 50:50 mixture of bupivacaine 0.5% and lignocaine 2% with 5 μg/ml epinephrine) injected was 6 ml in each trunk, which was varied by 1 ml/trunk for each consecutive patient according to the response of the previous patient. The MELAV50, MELAV95 and MELAV99 were calculated using Probit transformation and logistic regression. Results Out of the 21 patients, 13 patients had a successful block. The MELAV50, MELAV95 and MELAV99 were 7.41, 10.47 and 12 ml, respectively. Eight patients in whom block failed had sparing in the ulnar and median nerve territories. Conclusion Trunks of the brachial plexus can be identified and targeted for the injection of local anaesthetics. The MELAV50 and MELAV95 required for ultrasound-guided truncal injection brachial plexus block were 7.4 and 10.4 ml, respectively.","Sivashanmugam, T; Sripriya, R; Jayaraman, Gobinath; Ravindran, Charulatha; Ravishankar, M",Indian journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.4103/ija.ija_803_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724251/,247

This study tested the benefits of a metabolic support protocol based on insulin infusion, for reducing liver dysfunction following hepatic resection. METHODS Consecutive consenting patients scheduled for liver resection were randomized to receive preoperative dextrose infusion followed by insulin therapy using the hyperinsulinaemic normoglycaemic clamp protocol (n = 29) or standard therapy (control group, n = 27). Patients in the insulin therapy group followed a strict dietary regimen for 24 h before surgery. Intravenous dextrose was started at 2 mg per kg per min the night before and continued until surgery. Hyperinsulinaemic therapy for a total of 24 h was initiated at 2 munits per kg per min at induction of anaesthesia, and continued at 1 munit per kg per min after surgery. Normoglycaemia was maintained (3.5-6.0 mmol/l). Control subjects received no additional dietary supplement and a conventional insulin sliding scale during fasting. All patients were tested serially to evaluate liver function using the Schindl score. Liver tissue samples were collected at two time points during surgery to measure glycogen levels. RESULTS Demographics were similar in the two groups. More liver dysfunction occurred in the control cohort (liver dysfunction score range 0-8 versus 0-4 with insulin therapy; P = 0.031). Median (interquartile range) liver glycogen content was 278 (153-312) and 431 (334-459) µmol/g respectively (P = 0.011).

We evaluated 32 MI patients at Pusat Perubatan Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia and 32 control subjects (all ages 37-87 years). Statistical analysis revealed that the mean amplitude-derived SDPPG features were higher in MI patients than in control subjects. In contrast, the mean interval-derived SDPPG features were lower in MI patients than in the controls.

Understanding TB transmission is critical to creating policies and monitoring the disease with the end goal of TB elimination. To our knowledge, there has been no systematic review of key transmission parameters for TB. We carried out a systematic review of the published literature to identify studies estimating either of the two key TB transmission parameters: the serial interval (SI) and the reproductive number. We identified five publications that estimated the SI and 56 publications that estimated the reproductive number. The SI estimates from four studies were: 0.57, 1.42, 1.44 and 1.65 years; the fifth paper presented age-specific estimates ranging from 20 to 30 years (for infants <1 year old) to <5 years (for adults). The reproductive number estimates ranged from 0.24 in the Netherlands (during 1933-2007) to 4.3 in China in 2012. We found a limited number of publications and many high TB burden settings were not represented.

Analysing learning curves allows us to objectively quantify performance. The aim was to evaluate if the rate of learning and ultimate proficiency level reached in SILS when using straight or articulating instruments is different to conventional laparoscopy and if training in laparoscopy influences learning or proficiency for SILS. DESIGN AND SETTING Thirty-six surgically naive medical students were randomised to complete the validated peg transfer task over 50 repetitions using a conventional laparoscopic set-up, SILS set-up with straight instruments or articulated instruments or SILS set-up after having reached proficiency using a conventional laparoscopy. RESULTS There was a significant increased overall proficiency between the group trained in conventional laparoscopy and all other groups (p < 0.01), with no difference between the other groups. There was no difference in the rate of learning between the groups. There was no difference in the ultimate proficiency level (p = 0.671) or rate of learning (p = 0.63) when using straight or articulating instruments. There was no difference in ultimate proficiency level (p = 0.59) or learning rate (p = 0.219) seen in the SILS group that had prior training on the task with a conventional laparoscopic set-up. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study indicate that the proficiency reached using a conventional laparoscopic set-up cannot be matched using a SILS configuration for the novice surgeon and that the choice of straight or articulated instruments as well as previous laparoscopic training does not confer an advantage in this basic task.","Sodergren, Mikael; McGregor, Colleen; Farne, Hugo A; Cao, Jiguo; Lv, Zhijun; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Athanasiou, Thanos; Darzi, Ara; Paraskeva, Paraskevas",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-012-2113-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23225160/,247

163927,The Italian vascular surgery residency program during COVID-19 emergency,2021,"Adaptive and highly synchronized supply chains can avoid a cascading rise-and-fall inventory dynamic and mitigate ripple effects caused by operational failures. This paper aims to demonstrate how a deep reinforcement learning agent based on the proximal policy optimization algorithm can synchronize inbound and outbound flows and support business continuity operating in the stochastic and nonstationary environment if end-to-end visibility is provided. The deep reinforcement learning agent is built upon the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, which does not require hardcoded action space and exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. These features, complimented with a straightforward supply chain environment, give rise to a general and task unspecific approach to adaptive control in multi-echelon supply chains. The proposed approach is compared with the base-stock policy, a well-known method in classic operations research and inventory control theory. The base-stock policy is prevalent in continuous-review inventory systems. The paper concludes with the statement that the proposed solution can perform adaptive control in complex supply chains. The paper also postulates fully fledged supply chain digital twins as a necessary infrastructural condition for scalable real-world applications.","Kegenbekov, Zhandos Jackson Ilya",Algorithms,https://doi.org/10.3390/a14080240,247

Results from the RECORDER Project.",2021-08-18,"The COVID-19 pandemic has massively impacted the health of many people worldwide and poses significant challenges for our social, economic, and political life. Global vaccination should help the world overcome the pandemic and return to a “normal” life. In Germany, the Federal Ministry of Health presented its “National Vaccination Strategy COVID-19”, which describes the primary actors, elements, and activities required for the immunization of the German population. However, the implementation is challenging due to the federal organization of the German state in sixteen federal states. While essential processes such as vaccination rate monitoring and surveillance are planned centrally, the sixteen federal states are responsible for implementing the vaccination strategy in a decentralized manner. Furthermore, the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR) imposes strict rules for processing and exchanging personal data. However, Germany is only a case in point. Governmental decisions always need to be implemented by regional and/or local actors, the number of which varies greatly depending on the country. This work addresses these challenges by proposing the COVID-19-Vacc Platform—an open and decentralized digital platform focused on vaccinations as a matter of example. The proposed platform model connects various actors and enables them to involve, conduct, and track the vaccination process while meeting all necessary data protection and security requirements defined by EU-GDPR. Using the DMS Reference Model as the theoretical framework, the blueprint of the COVID-19-Vacc Platform is developed, outlining the platform’s ecosystem structure, its interactions process model, and the service stack, defining how the proposed platform works on the operational level. Our COVID-19-Vacc Platform may help facilitate a fast and EU-GDPR compliant implementation of COVID-19 vaccination strategies. Beyond that, the proposed open and decentralized platform model might facilitate international interconnectivity and therefore the management of emerging global pandemics or other global health-related crisis.","Radonjic-Simic, Mirjana Mahrt Christian Niemand Sven Speck Andreas Windrich Melanie","Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity",https://doi.org/10.3390/joitmc7030186,247

The usage of single-use face masks has increased enormously since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and pollution from the huge volume of discarded single-use face masks may become an environmental issue. This study focuses on synthetic antioxidants (AOs), including synthetic phenolic antioxidants (SPAs) and organophosphite antioxidants (OPAs), used in single-use three-layer face masks. Both SPAs and OPAs were detected in single-use face masks, with total concentrations ranging from 20.0 to 575 μg/g (median of 175 μg/g). The dominant congeners detected in the face masks were tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite (AO168, median of 83.2 μg/g), tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate (AO168O, median of 72.9 μg/g), and pentaerythritol tetrakis[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate] (AO1010, median of 13.7 μg/g). No significant concentration difference was observed between medical and nonmedical face masks. Among the three different layers of the face masks, the middle layers showed the highest AO concentrations. On the basis of the median concentrations detected, we estimate that 1084 tons of AOs is used in face masks annually, suggesting that discarded face masks may be a source of AOs to the environment. This is the first study to report the occurrence of a wide range of AOs in face masks. ©","Liu, R.; Mabury, S.

166796,Outcomes for cancer patients on systemic anti-cancer therapies during the COVID-19 pandemic from the CAPITOL (COVID-19 Cancer PatIenT Outcomes in North London) cohort study,2021,"Widespread use of masks was mandated in many countries as a direct result of the covid-19 pandemic. This meant that mask wearing, which was previously restricted to specialized occupations or cities with high levels of pollution became the norm in many places of the world. This has obvious implications for any system that uses facial images to infer user state. This work attempts to gauge the effect of mask wearing on such systems. Arousal classification is used in this study due to its well-studied nature in image processing literature. Using “Affect in the wild” video dataset, the “masks” were synthetically placed on the facial images extracted from videos. A binary classification between high and low arousal shows that there is a drop in accuracy when using masks. However, this drop is larger in across subject classification than within subject classification. The study shows that it is feasible to develop effective user state classification models even with mask cover. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bandara, D.","23rd International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, HCII 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-78642-7_10,247

Design Cohort study to assess whether a no-test telemedicine-hybrid care model (telemedicine with in-person provision only when indicated) was non-inferior to the traditional service model (blanket in-person provision including ultrasound scan). Setting The three main abortion providers in England and Wales. Participants All patients having an early medical abortion in the two months before and after the service model change. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the cohorts to adjust for any systematic differences in the two groups. Main outcome measures Access: waiting time, gestation at abortion Effectiveness: the proportion of successful medical abortions Safety: significant adverse events defined as: haemorrhage requiring transfusion, significant infection requiring hospital admission, major surgery, death. We also examined the incidence of ectopic pregnancy and late gestation. Acceptability: Patient-reported outcomes of satisfaction, future preference, and privacy of consultation Results The study sample included 52,142 medical abortions; 22,158 in the traditional cohort and 29,984 in the telemedicine-hybrid cohort, of which 61% were provided using no-test telemedicine. The cohorts accounted for 85% of all medical abortions provided in England and Wales during the study period. Mean waiting times were 4.2 days shorter in the telemedicine-hybrid cohort, and 40% were provided at <=6 weeks' gestation compared to 25% in the traditional cohort (p<0.001). There was no difference in success rates between the two groups (98.2% vs. 98.8%, p=1.0), nor in the prevalence of serious adverse events (0.04% vs. 0.02%, p=0.557). The incidence of ectopic pregnancy was equivalent in both cohorts (0.2%, p=0.796), with no significant difference in the proportions being treated after abortion (0.01% vs 0.03%, p=0.123). In 0.04% of cases the abortion appeared to have been provided at over 10 weeks' gestation; these abortions were all completed at home without additional medical complications. In the telemedicine-hybrid group, the effectiveness for abortions conducted using telemedicine (n=18,435) was higher than for those conducted in-person (n=11,549), 99.2% vs. 98.1%, p<0.001. Acceptability was high (96% satisfied), 80% reported a future preference for telemedicine and none reported that they were unable to consult in private using teleconsultation. Conclusions Medical abortion provided through a hybrid model that includes no-test telemedicine without routine ultrasound is effective, safe, acceptable, and improves access to care.","Aiken, A. R.

In addition to enhancing the capacity of cities to prepare for and absorb risks, adaptation measures provide multiple co-benefits. However, health co-benefits are among the least explored. These are now seen as increasingly important with the renewed focus on public health since the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reviews literature focused on the health co-benefits of urban climate change adaptation measures. Health co-benefits of seven different categories of adaptation measures are discussed. Results showed that existing evidence is mainly related to some categories such as critical infrastructure, nature-based solutions, and urban planning and design measures. Other adaptation categories like early warning systems;policy, management & governance, including local adaptation policies;and measures and strategies related to ‘knowledge, perceptions & behavior’ that mainly involve people's understanding and individual responses to climate change, are relatively underexplored. Moreover, it was discussed that some adaptation measures may result in health trade-offs and these needs to be further studied. Overall, through identifying health co-benefits, results of this review can make a strong case for further promotion of climate change adaptation in cities. © 2021","Sharifi, A.; Pathak, M.; Joshi, C.; He, B.

In this article, through the approach to an emergency such as COVID-19, we propose a two-stage model capable of considering human suffering, the cost of humanitarian logistics, and the benefit obtained by the interaction of suppliers that generally behave as oligopolies through a mathematical programming model and one of the cooperative games. Our main finding was the adaptability of a previously validated model for humanitarian logistics to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where the externalities had greater relevance in social costs than private costs.

Extensive investigations have been performed to study the clinical and cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies have revealed the cellular changes due to the infection and identified a plethora of interactors for all SARS-CoV-2 components, except for the longest non-structural protein 3 (NSP3). Here, we expressed the full-length NSP3 proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to investigate their unique and shared functions using multi-omics methods. We conducted interactome, phosphoproteome, ubiquitylome, transcriptome, and proteome analyses of NSP3-expressing cells. We found that NSP3 plays essential roles in cellular functions such as RNA metabolism and immune response such as NF-κB signal transduction. Interestingly, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 has both endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial localizations. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 is more closely related to mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, whereas SARS-CoV NSP3 is related to the cytosolic ribosomal proteins. In summary, our multi-omics studies of NSP3 enhance our understanding of the functions of NSP3 and offer valuable insights for the development of anti-SARS strategies.","Shi, Ruona; Feng, Zhenhuan; Zhang, Xiaofei",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.19.452910,247

A Case Series and Comprehensive Review,2021-07-20,"Background: Since December 2020, three COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized in the United States (U.S.) and were proceeded by large immunization programs. The aim of this study was to characterize the U.S. post-marketing safety (PMS) profiles of these vaccines with an in-depth analysis of mortality data. Methods: This was a retrospective database analysis study. Details of the U.S. PMS reports (15 December 2020 to 19 March 2021) of the three vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen Ad26.COV2.S) were retrieved from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). A descriptive analysis was conducted to characterize the reported adverse events (AEs). A comparative (Pfizer-BioNTech vs. Moderna) analysis of mortality was conducted. The mean count ratio of death between the two vaccines was estimated using a negative binomial regression model adjusting for the measured confounders. Results: A total of 44,451 AE reports were retrieved (corresponding to 0.05% of the U.S. population who received at least one dose). The most commonly reported AEs were injection site reactions (30.4% of the reports), pain (reported in 26.7% of the reports), and headache (18.6% of the reports). Serious AEs were reported in only 14.6% of the reports with 4,108 hospitalizations. The total number of deaths was 1,919 with a mean count ratio of Moderna (n=997) vs. Pfizer-BioNTech (n=899) of 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.33). Conclusions: The vast majority of PMS AEs in the U.S. were non-serious, and the number of serious AEs is very low given the total number of vaccinated U.S. population.","Albalawi, O. M.; Alomran, M.

In such a scenario, quick and accurate detection of coronavirus infection plays an important role in timely referral of physicians and control transmission of the disease. RT-PCR is the most widely used method for identification of coronavirus disease 19 patients, but it is time consuming and takes two to three days to deliver the report. Researchers around the world are looking for alternative machine learning techniques including deep learning to assist the medical experts for early Covid-19 disease diagnosis from medical pictures such as X-ray films and CT scans. Since the facility for chest X-rays is available even in smaller towns and is relatively less expensive, it would be useful to design machine learning methods for proving initial Covid-19 detection from chest X-rays to contain this pandemic. Thus, in this work, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet) for the finding of presence and absence of Covid-19 disease. We compare the CNN model with traditional and transfer learning-based machine learning algorithms. The proposed CNN is accurate compared to the traditional machine learning algorithms (KNN, SVM, DT etc.).

A Survey of Population Behavior in Argentina,2021,"The pandemic has taken the world by storm. Almost the entire world went into lockdown to save the people from the deadly COVID-19. Scientists around the around have come up with several vaccines for the virus. Among them, Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca have become quite famous. General people however have been expressing their feelings about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines on social media like Twitter. In this study, such tweets are being extracted from Twitter using a Twitter API authentication token. The raw tweets are stored and processed using NLP. The processed data is then classified using a supervised KNN classification algorithm. The algorithm classifies the data into three classes, positive, negative, and neutral. These classes refer to the sentiment of the general people whose Tweets are extracted for analysis. From the analysis it is seen that Pfizer shows 47.29% positive, 37.5% negative, and 15.21% neutral, Moderna shows 46.16% positive, 40.71% negative, and 13.13% neutral, AstraZeneca shows 40.08% positive, 40.06% negative, and 13.86% neutral sentiment. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Some are human-controllable (e.g. interventional policies, mobility and the vaccine);some are not (e.g. the weather). We have sought to test how a change in these human-controllable factors might influence two measures: the number of daily cases against economic impact. If applied at the right level and with up-to-date data to measure, policymakers would be able to make targeted interventions and measure their cost. This study aims to provide a predictive analytics framework to model, predict and simulate COVID-19 propagation and the socio-economic impact of interventions intended to reduce the spread of the disease such as policy and/or vaccine. It allows policymakers, government representatives and business leaders to make better-informed decisions about the potential effect of various interventions with forward-looking views via scenario planning.

In addition to PCR diagnosis, periodic seroepidemiologic surveillance is important to analyze the epidemic situation. In this study, we analyzed the rate of seropositivity for the SARS-CoV-2 N and S antigens in Hyogo prefecture, Japan in August 2021. Sera collected from people who received a health check-up in a clinic of the Hyogo Prefecture Health Promotion Association were subjected to analysis of reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 N and S antigens by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. For a total 1,000 sera, the positive rates to N and S antigens were 2.1% and 38.7%, respectively. The infectious rate estimated by serological analysis based on the presence of the anti-N antibody was 2.5-fold higher than the value reported based on PCR-based analysis, and it increased five-fold compared to the rate determined by our previous seroepidemiologic study in October, 2020. The anti-S positive rate was almost consistent with the vaccination rate in this area. The observed high anti-S antibody level in the seropositive population may indicate that the mass vaccination in Japan is being performed smoothly at this time point, although the infectious rate has also increased.","Ren, Z.; Furukawa, K.; Nishimura, M.; Kurahashi, Y.; Sutandhio, S.; Tjan, L.

Transmission of Variola is by respiratory droplets, and MVA delivered by skin scarification (s.s.) protected mice far more effectively against lethal respiratory challenge with VACV than any other route of delivery, and at much lower doses. Comparisons of s.s. with intradermal, subcutaneous or intramuscular routes showed that MVAOVA s.s.-generated T cells were both more abundant and transcriptionally distinct. MVAOVA s.s. produced greater numbers of lung Ova-specific CD8+ TRM and was superior in protecting mice against lethal VACVOVA respiratory challenge. Nearly as many lung TRM were generated with MVAOVA s.s. compared to direct pulmonary immunization with MVAOVA, and both routes vaccination protected mice against lethal pulmonary challenge with VACVOVA. Strikingly, MVAOVA s.s.-generated effector T cells exhibited overlapping gene transcriptional profiles to those generated via direct pulmonary immunization. Overall, our data suggest that heterologous MVA vectors delivered via s.s. are uniquely well-suited as vaccine vectors for respiratory pathogens like COVID-19. In addition, MVA delivered via s.s. could represent a more effective dose-sparing smallpox vaccine.","Pan, Youdong; Liu, Luzheng; Tian, Tian; Zhao, Jingxia; Park, Chang Ook; Lofftus, Serena Y.; Stingley, Claire A.; Mei, Shenglin; Liu, Xing; Kupper, Thomas S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.079046,247

176302,Low dose hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis for COVID-19 - a prospective study,2021-09-14,"Background: Telemedicine counseling (TMC) has gained rapid development during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prospect of using this technology in rheumatology was based on the possibility of getting maximum information about the patient during the survey, examination and interpretation of laboratory and instrumental data, that is excepting direct contact with the patient. Several rheumatological clinics have reported on the success of using TMC. However, there is very little data of the difficulties that can be encountered when organizing this process. Objectives: To characterize the identified problems during TMC in rheumatology, to suggest potential directions for their elimination. Methods: Since June 2021, on the basis of the Medical Association “New Hospital”, Yekaterinburg, Russian Federation, 76 TMCs have been performed on the profile of rheumatology in patients aged 29 to 71 years. Of these, 13 applied to the primary TMC, the other patients were preliminarily examined in person. The consultation included the preliminary acquaintance with the examination results, a 20-minute video communication and writing of a conclusion. After each TMC, a survey was conducted between the doctor and the patient, including the identified deficiencies in counseling. The frequency of identified problems is presented as an absolute indicator and as a percentage of the total number of TMCs performed. Results: We noted a high degree of patient satisfaction: 74 (97.4%) responded that they received answers to all. However, according to the doctor, the following groups of problems were identified. [1] Technical problems in 29 (38.2%): most often there were various problems with the Internet, but there were also registered: the end of the charge on the patient's tablet, the patient was not registered in the electronic queue. Elimination of these violations depends on the work of IT-specialists, but each consulting physician should be prepared for an immediate transition to an alternative form of communication (for example -telephone). [2] Lack of objective examination, leading to the impossibility of correct remote diagnosis -8 (10.5%). This problem was identified due to the inability to establish the presence or absence of arthritis during the initial diagnosis (6 cases) and to clarify the nature of the rash (2 cases). All patients are invited for a face-to-face consultation. [3] The need to write prescriptions for psychotropic drugs -12 (15.8%), which under the conditions of national legislation cannot be done in the TMC regime. [4] The time spent directly on remote communication with the patient was 17.2 minutes (from 8 to 31), however, taking into account the study data and writing the conclusion, the total time was 40.7 minutes (from 21 to 73). Thus, it turned out that the average time for remote and face-to-face consultations is the same, while TMC's payment is only about 50% of the face-to-face consultation. This situation reduces the doctor's interest in carrying out TMC. The solution to the problem is associated with reducing the time for the documentation process through technical improvements. In addition, of the 9 patients in whom the TMC process lasted 60 minutes or more, 5 were diagnosed with fibromyalgia. It is possible that with a previously established diagnosis of fibromyalgia, only face-to-face counseling should be recommended to patients. Conclusion: The TMC system is promising, however, there are a number of problems that need to be improved, since they can reduce the doctor's interest in using this technology.","Livshits, Y.; Teplyakova, O.; Sarapulova, A.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.1183,247

Here, we aimed to elucidate the effect of DMTs on the humoral immune response to mRNA-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in MS patients. Methods: We obtained sera from 912 Sardinian MS patients and 63 healthy controls 30 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine and tested them for SARS-CoV-2 response using anti-Spike (S) protein-based serology. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by anti-Nucleocapsid (N) serology. Patients were either untreated or undergoing treatment with a total of 13 different DMTs. Differences between treatment groups comprised of at least 10 patients were assessed by generalized linear mixed-effects model. Demographic and clinical data and smoking status were analyzed as additional factors potentially influencing humoral immunity from COVID-19 vaccine. Results: MS patients treated with natalizumab, teriflunomide, azathioprine, fingolimod, ocrelizumab, and rituximab showed significantly lower humoral responses compared to untreated patients. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in response between patients treated with the other drugs (dimethyl fumarate, interferon, alemtuzumab and glatiramer acetate) and untreated patients. In addition, older age, male sex and active smoking were significantly associated with lower antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2. MS patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher humoral responses to vaccine than uninfected patients. Conclusion: Humoral response to BNT162b2 is significantly influenced by the specific DMTs followed by patients, as well as by other factors such as previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, age, sex, and smoking status. These results are important to inform targeted strategies to prevent clinically relevant COVID-19 in MS patients.","Pitzalis, M.; Idda, M.

178413,Effect of familiarity with COVID-19 infection--history of infection or close contact--on outing behaviors when a state of emergency is declared,2021-08-21,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a lethal respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emerged in the end of 2019 and has since spread aggressively across the globe. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cellular infection by coronaviruses is therefore of utmost importance. A critical stage in infection is the fusion between viral and host membranes. Here, we present a detailed investigation of the role of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, and the influence of calcium and cholesterol, in this fusion process. Structural information from specular neutron reflectometry and small angle neutron scattering, complemented by dynamics information from quasi-elastic and spin-echo neutron spectroscopy, revealed strikingly different functions encoded in the Spike fusion domain. Calcium drives the N-terminal of the Spike fusion domain to fully cross the host plasma membrane. Removing calcium however re-orients the protein to the lipid leaflet in contact with the virus, leading to significant changes in lipid fluidity and rigidity. In conjunction with other regions of the fusion domain which are also positioned to bridge and dehydrate viral and host membranes, the molecular events leading to cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 are proposed. SIGNIFICANCE We have recreated here important elements of the critical membrane fusion mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus by simplifying the system down to its core elements, amenable to experimental analysis by neutron scattering. Neutrons are well suited for the study of protein – membrane interactions under physiological conditions, since they allow structural and dynamics characterization at room temperature. Our results revealed strikingly different functions encoded in the viral Spike fusion domain and thereby provide a potential calcium-dependent cell entry mechanism for SARS-CoV-2. In particular, calcium drives the protein’s N-terminal to harpoon through the host membrane, while removing calcium re-orients the protein so that it is able to bridge and dehydrate lipid membranes, facilitating their fusion.","Santamaria, Andreas; Batchu, Krishna C.; Matsarskaia, Olga; Prévost, Sylvain F.; Russo, Daniela; Natali, Francesca; Seydel, Tilo; Hoffmann, Ingo; Laux, Valerie; Haertlein, Michael; Darwish, Tamim A.; Russell, Robert A.; Corucci, Giacomo; Fragneto, Giovanna; Maestro, Armando; Zaccai, Nathan R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.30.458099,247

It then aims at identifying the key predictors of perceived travel risk in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. A theoretically grounded framework is proposed which can be further improved to understand and predict international travel behaviours within the context of global pandemics.Design/methodology/approachA mixed-methods design is adopted. In the first phase referred to as Study 1, a cross-sectional design is used based on a sample of 217 international outgoing tourists surveyed at the Mauritian International Airport and data is analysed using hierarchical regression. In Phase 2, referred to as Study 2, a purposive sample of tourists around the world are interviewed and data is analysed using the thematic analysis technique.FindingsThe results show that amongst those tourists who are willing to travel in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, the related perceived risk is likely to influence their travelling intention. Several key predictors of perceived travel risks are uncovered, those are categorised as COVID-19 status;transportation services;national sanitary measures;health-care services;accommodation services;ecotourism facilities. Moreover, the potential effects of those factors on perceived COVID-19 related travel risk are likely to be moderated by the trustworthiness of the information.Practical implicationsThe implications of the study are important for researchers and policymakers to better understand and predict travellers’ behaviour in times of pandemics. These implications are also important to tourism marketers and transport and hospitality service providers to more effectively manage and mitigate the effect of such events.Originality/valueThe study provides an original comprehensive model grounded in the social cognitive theory and protection motivation theory to understand the predictors of perceived travel risks in relation to COVID-19 at a destination.","Teeroovengadum, Viraiyan Seetanah Boopen Bindah Eric Pooloo Arshad Veerasawmy Isven",Tourism Review of AIEST - International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism,https://doi.org/10.1108/tr-05-2020-0195,247

Objective: To analyze the status of physical therapy education in Brazilian public and private institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study with professors from physical therapy courses in Brazil. The study was conducted using an electronic form distributed via a social media application, containing questions on the characteristics of the professor, educational institution and work process. Associations were analyzed by the chi-squared test at 5% significance. Results: A total of 313 professors from 22 Brazilian states participated, with 62.94% from private institutions and 73.80% reporting that activities were conducted via emergency remote teaching (ERT). Among the professors who shifted to ERT, 63.20% did so with no prior planning and 28.13% had received no training for this this teaching format. An association was observed between the type of institution (public or private) and professors' age (p &lt; 0.001), sex (p &lt; 0.001), teaching experience (p &lt; 0.001) and adopting ERT (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: In Brazil, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted most institutions to switch to ERT, more prevalent at private facilities, with no prior planning for the transition from in-person to remote teaching.","Medeiros, Arthur de Almeida; Batiston, Adriane Pires; Souza, Laís Alves de; Ferrari, Fernando Pierette; Barbosa, Isabelle Ribeiro",Fisioter.

183924,Ethnicity and COVID-19 cardiovascular complications: a multi-center UK cohort.,2020,"Background & Aim: Our new chromatin opening models which free from potential mutation sites that reduce the size of the current UCOE models used in gene therapy and recombinant protein biotechnology studies, tested on various cell groups, including mouse stem cell groups. As a result, it has been demonstrated in terms of replacing existing UCOE models that these new UCOE candidates we have developed are more efficient than the previous ones and that they are also a safer profile model for clinical gene therapy studies since they are free from additional cassette areas. To see the potentiality of our new generation UCOE designs in gene therapy studies, it was tested whether the universal chromatin opening abilities will be retained stable of activation on human induced pluripotent stem cells by differentiating them into different tissue cell types as done before on mouse embryonic stem cells. Methods, Results & Conclusion: After transfection of induced human pluripotent stem cells with Lentiviral vectors carrying the UCOE [Figure presented] [Figure presented] candidates, the activation of UCOE elements which carry a reporter gene, were measured by flowytometry, immunofluorescence staining and DNA methylation analyses for two months without differentiation and also after tissue type differentiation into nerve, hepatocyte and cardiomycet type cells. In the light of the obtained results, it has been observed that the new UCOE designs (1.2kb and 1.7kb UCOE chromatin elements) that we developed, have maintained their expression levels stably on human iPS cells before and after differentiation into three different tissue type cells. And additionally, they also showed their potential on monoclonal antibody production with CHO cells as producing mg and gr level of recombinant antibodies into two months of period in another parallel study. In addition, our new 0.5kb design (0.5kb UCOE), produced from another CpG density region of HNRPA2B1 gene, has been observed to display a stable expression level compared to our other designs and even a more stable profile. The new 0.5kb, 1.2kb 1.7kb (without expression enhancing cassette regions, thus eliminating the potential mutation problem) with a length of 10, 6 and 3 times shorter than the current standard A2UCOE models showed to be more advantageous for gene therapy and recombinant protein production studies as well. Recently, we have been using these new models now on producing the two of the target antigens of COVID-19 to provide a potential recombinant vaccine candidate.","Anakok, O. F.; Bayindirli, K.

The disease has successfully spread all over the world. Wearing a mask can practically protect the infection. Thus, detecting people wearing and not wearing masks in public is essential. However, there is still some room to improve detection accuracy of the present methods. In this paper, the transfer learning model and FR-TSVM model are used to study the latest data of pneumonia epidemic situation in Covid-19. First, a data set of 12,000 facial images wearing masks and not wearing masks in public was collected for training, testing, and validation. The pictures will be put into the improved VGG model. Then the structure of VGG model was used to extract the features of images. These features were trained by FR-TSVM with fuzzy concept included.

Histological examination of the brains and spinal cords of these animals reveals the presence of large numbers of activated macrophages/microglia. In two other experimental models of demyelination, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelination, depletion of hematogenous macrophages abrogates the demyelinating process. In both of these diseases, early events in the demyelinating process are inhibited by macrophage depletion. From these studies, it was not possible to determine whether infiltrating macrophages were required for late steps in the process, such as myelin removal. In this study, we show that when macrophages are depleted with either unmodified or mannosylated liposomes encapsulating dichloromethylene diphosphate, the amount of demyelination detected in MHV-infected mice is not affected. At a time when these cells were completely depleted from the liver, approximately equivalent numbers of macrophages were present in the spinal cords of control and drug-treated animals. These results suggest that blood-borne macrophages are not required for MHV-induced demyelination and also suggest that other cells, such as perivascular macrophages or microglia, perform the function of these cells in the presence of drug.","Xue, S; Sun, N; Van Rooijen, N; Perlman, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10400724/,247
192279,COVID-19 in pancreatic carcinoma patients.,2021,"We previously described mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) variant V51 derived from a persistent infection of murine DBT cells with an expanded host range (R. S. Baric, E. Sullivan, L. Hensley, B. Yount, and W. Chen, J. Virol. 73:638-649, 1999). Sequencing of the V51 spike gene, the mediator of virus entry, revealed 13 amino acid substitutions relative to the originating MHV A59 strain. Seven substitutions were located in the amino-terminal S1 cleavage subunit, and six were located in the carboxy-terminal S2 cleavage subunit. Using targeted RNA recombination, we constructed a panel of recombinant viruses to map the mediators of host range to the six substitutions in S2, with a subgroup of four changes of particular interest. This subgroup maps to two previously identified domains within S2, a putative fusion peptide and a heptad repeat, both conserved features of class I fusion proteins. In addition to an altered host range, V51 displayed altered utilization of CEACAM1a, the high-affinity receptor for A59. Interestingly, a recombinant with S1 from A59 and S2 from V51 was severely debilitated in its ability to productively infect cells via CEACAM1a, while the inverse recombinant was not. This result suggests that the S2 substitutions exert powerful effects on the fusion trigger that normally passes from S1 to S2. These novel findings play against the existing data that suggest that MHV host range determinants are located in the S1 subunit, which harbors the receptor binding domain, or involve coordinating changes in both S1 and S2. Mounting evidence also suggests that the class I fusion mechanism may possess some innate plasticity that regulates viral host range.","McRoy, Willie C; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18032498/,247

The transfer of Lyt-1+ T cells specific for an unrelated antigen (hen egg lysozyme) did not protect.

Adoptive transfer prevented death due to JHM virus infection but did not result in altered antiviral immunoglobulin synthesis or the suppression of viral replication in the central nervous system (CNS). The data presented implicate a local DTH response in the protection of the host from lethal infection of the CNS by a neurotropic virus, but clearly imply that other antiviral effector mechanisms are necessary for the suppression of viral replication.","Stohlman, S A; Matsushima, G K; Casteel, N; Weiner, L P",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2420882/,247

The nosocomial infection (NI) incidence rate varies from 0.59 to 0.72 per 100 patients in pediatric wards. Many viruses have been associated with NI in pediatric wards. Rotavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the most frequent. Other viruses frequently identified are: calicivirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, influenza et para-influenza, rhinovirus and coronavirus. Asymptomatic infections occur frequently. The period of communicability varies and depends on the virus. It often begins before the clinical signs appear and ends after the healing. Viral shedding may be intermittent. Children and hospital environment and less frequently hospital staff are the main source for the virus. Poor handwashing results in direct spread to patient or self-inoculation even for respiratory viruses like RSV and rhinovirus. The main risk factors for NI are prolonged hospital stay, past history of prematurity and low age. Immunocompromised patients constitute a special high-risk group. Understaffing is also a risk factor. Minimal infective doses depend on the route of inoculation and the kind of virus. Low doses are for example sufficient for rotavirus, adenovirus and calicivirus. Viral inactivation is all the more easy when there is an envelope. Handwashing and appropriate isolation (technical and geographical) are the mainstay of prevention of viral NI.

In this paper, the efficiency of nucleic acid amplification techniques for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections is reviewed. In general, these techniques should be applied only for the detection of microorganisms for which available diagnostic techniques are markedly insensitive or nonexistent or when turnaround times for existing tests (e.g., viral culture) are much longer than those expected with amplification. This is the case for rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and hantaviruses causing a pulmonary syndrome, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii. For Legionella spp. and fungi, contamination originating from the environment is a limiting factor in interpretation of results, as is the difficulty in differentiating colonization and infection. Detection of these agents in urine or blood by amplification techniques remains to be evaluated. In the clinical setting, there is no need for molecular diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii. At present, amplification methods for Mycobacterium tuberculosis cannot replace the classical diagnostic techniques, due to their lack of sensitivity and the absence of specific internal controls for the detection of inhibitors of the reaction. Also, the results of interlaboratory comparisons are unsatisfactory. Furthermore, isolates are needed for susceptibility studies. Additional work remains to be done on sample preparation methods, comparison between different amplification methods, and analysis of results. The techniques can be useful for the rapid identification of M. tuberculosis in particular circumstances, as well as the rapid detection of most rifampin-resistant isolates. The introduction of diagnostic amplification techniques into a clinical laboratory implies a level of proficiency for excluding false-positive and false-negative results.","Ieven, M; Goossens, H",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9105753/,247

Like all viral vectors, the MV vector efficacy in inducing a protecting immune answer could be affected by the pre-existing immunity among the human population. In order to determine the optimal immunization route and regimen, we mimicked a MV pre-immunity by passively administrating MV neutralizing antibodies (MV-nAb) prior intramuscular (i.m.) and/or intranasal (i.n.) immunization with recombinant MV expressing the SIV-gag antigen (rMV-SIVgag). Our results revealed that 500 mIU of MV-nAb allowed the induction of a humoral and cellular immune response against the vector and the transgene, while higher titers of the MV-nAb were significantly inhibitory. In a prime-boost regimen, in the presence of MV-nAb, the intranasal-intramuscular (i.n.-i.m.) or intramuscular-intramuscular (i.m.-i.m.) routes induced higher humoral immune responses against the vector and the transgene (SIV-gag). In naive animals, cellular immune response was significantly higher by i.m. immunization; however, MV pre-immunity did not seem to affect the cellular immune response after an i.n. immunization. In summary, we show that a pre-existing immunity of up to 500 mIU anti-MV neutralizing antibodies had little effect on the replication of rMV and did not inhibit the induction of significant humoral and cellular immune responses in immune-competent mice.","Knuchel, Marlyse C; Marty, René R; Morin, Teldja Neige Azzouz; Ilter, Orhan; Zuniga, Armando; Naim, Hussein Y",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23324399/,247

We identified an insertion of two glycine residues, forming the GxxxG motif, in the SCoV spike protein transmembrane domain (TMD), which is not found in any other coronavirus. This surprising finding raises an ""oligomerization riddle"": the GxxxG motif is a known dimerization signal, while the SCoV spike protein is known to be trimeric. Using an in vivo assay, we found that the SCoV spike protein TMD is oligomeric and that this oligomerization is driven by the GxxxG motif. We also found that the GxxxG motif contributes toward the trimerization of the entire spike protein; in that, mutations in the GxxxG motif decrease trimerization of the full-length protein expressed in mammalian cells. Using molecular modeling, we show that the SCoV spike protein TMD adopts a distinct and unique structure as opposed to all other coronaviruses. In this unique structure, the glycine residues of the GxxxG motif are facing each other, enhancing helix-helix interactions by allowing for the close positioning of the helices. This unique orientation of the glycine residues also stabilizes the trimeric bundle during multi-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulation in a hydrated lipid bilayer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the GxxxG motif can potentiate other oligomeric forms beside a dimer. Finally, according to recent studies, the stabilization of the trimeric bundle is linked to a higher fusion activity of the spike protein, and the possible influence of the GxxxG motif on this feature is discussed.","Arbely, Eyal; Granot, Zvi; Kass, Itamar; Orly, Joseph; Arkin, Isaiah T",Biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16981695/,247

200462,COVID-19-related fatal myocarditis in a 42-year-old female patient,2020,"Dengue virus (DV) is a member of the family Flaviviridae. These positive strand RNA viruses encode a polyprotein that is processed in case of DV into 10 proteins. Although for most of these proteins distinct functions have been defined, this is less clear for the highly hydrophobic non-structural protein (NS) 4B. Despite its possible role as an antagonist of the interferon-induced antiviral response, this protein may play an additional more direct role for viral replication. In this study we determined the subcellular localization, membrane association, and membrane topology of DV NS4B. We found that NS4B resides primarily in cytoplasmic foci originating from the endoplasmic reticulum. NS4B colocalizes with NS3 and double-stranded RNA, an intermediate of viral replication, arguing that NS4B is part of the membrane-bound viral replication complex. Biochemical analysis revealed that NS4B is an integral membrane protein, and that its preceding 2K signal sequence is not required for this integration. We identified three membrane-spanning segments in the COOH-terminal part of NS4B that are sufficient to target a cytosolic marker protein to intracellular membranes. Furthermore, we established a membrane topology model of NS4B in which the NH2-terminal part of the protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, whereas the COOH-terminal part is composed of three trans-membrane domains with the COOH-terminal tail localized in the cytoplasm. This topology model provides a good starting point for a detailed investigation of the function of NS4B in the DV life cycle.","Miller, Sven; Sparacio, Sandra; Bartenschlager, Ralf",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16436383/,247

The main characteristics of the member viruses are: (i) the virus particles are spherical, 50-70 nm in diameter, including an envelope with surface projections that incorporate two or three polypeptides, usually glycosylated; (ii) the nucleocapsid comprises a core protein and a single strand of positive-sense RNA, molecular weight about 4 X 10(6); where characterized, the RNA has an m7G 'cap' at the 5' end and is polyadenylated at the 3' end; (iii) maturation occurs by budding of spherical nucleocapsids 30-35 nm in diameter, with proven or presumed icosahedral symmetry, through cytoplasmic membranes. Where characterized, translation of structural proteins occurs on subgenomic messenger RNA(s); these appear to represent the 3' end of the genome. Nearly all alphavirus species are transmitted by mosquitoes. Transmission also occurs transovarially (Alphavirus) or transplacentally (Rubivirus and Pestivirus). Members of a genus are serologically related, but are not related to members of other genera.","Westaway, E G; Brinton, M A; Gaidamovich SYa,; Horzinek, M C; Igarashi, A; Kääriäinen, L; Lvov, D K; Porterfield, J S; Russell, P K; Trent, D W",Intervirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2999027/,247
201427,Caregiver Exclusion in the Age of COVID: Fighting Cancer With Half the Team,2021,"Classical immunization protocols have produced an antibody-based humoral response that is very effective against susceptible infectious diseases. Immunization introduces an external substance to induce the host immune system to respond specifically. Typically an antigen is used, but DNA, or a primed, pre-existing leukocyte or antigen-presenting cell, can also be used. Immunization is currently being used or investigated for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, cancer, addictions, allergies, pregnancy, and autoimmune diseases. It is also being used to produce biologically active materials such as polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, antivenins, and anti-toxins for treating a wide range of conditions. Animals have been integral to the development of immunization techniques, as producers of toxoids and antitoxins, as models (e.g., to validate materials and protocols used for immunization, to understand the impact of immunization itself on the immune system, and to help investigators devise methods for determining the efficacy of vaccines) and as beneficiaries themselves of vaccines and antitoxins. The choice of immunization protocols is complex, and results may be affected by many factors such as dose and concentration of antigen, choice of adjuvants, time between inoculation and response measurement, and method of detection. The immune system responses to an antigen are also complex and continue to develop with advancing age. Anatomical, physiological, and immune system differences between species influence responses to immunization, as do the purity and presentation of the antigens and adjuvants. When directly comparing results, animals should be sourced from the same supplier. This review highlights the many uses of immunization techniques and introduces important considerations for the choice of protocols and animal models.","Schunk, Michael K; Macallum, G Eileen",ILAR journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15953832/,247
202153,Use of Corticosteroids in COVID-19: Should It Be Considered as a Standard-of-Care Therapy?,2020,"Hepadnaviruses are DNA viruses but, as pararetroviruses, their morphogenesis initiates with the encapsidation of an RNA pregenome, and these viruses have therefore evolved mechanisms to exclude nucleocapsids that contain incompletely matured genomes from participating in budding and secretion. We provide here evidence that binding of hepadnavirus core particles from the cytosol to their target membranes is a distinct step in morphogenesis, discriminating among different populations of intracellular capsids. Using the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and a flotation assay, we found about half of the intracellular capsids to be membrane associated due to an intrinsic membrane-binding affinity. In contrast to free cytosolic capsids, this subpopulation contained largely mature, double-stranded DNA genomes and lacked core protein hyperphosphorylation, both features characteristic for secreted virions. Against expectation, however, the selective membrane attachment observed did not require the presence of the large DHBV envelope protein, which has been considered to be crucial for nucleocapsid-membrane interaction. Furthermore, removal of surface-exposed phosphate residues from nonfloating capsids by itself did not suffice to confer membrane affinity and, finally, hyperphosphorylation was absent from nonenveloped nucleocapsids that were released from DHBV-transfected cells. Collectively, these observations argue for a model in which nucleocapsid maturation, involving the viral genome, capsid structure, and capsid dephosphorylation, leads to the exposure of a membrane-binding signal as a step crucial for selecting the matured nucleocapsid to be incorporated into the capsid-independent budding of virus particles.","Mabit, H; Schaller, H",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11090143/,247

202365,"Are clarithromycin, azithromycin and their analogues effective in the treatment of COVID19?",2021,"OBJECTIVE: To examine recent vaccination trends among Brazilian children during their first year of life, and the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on these trends. METHODS: Monthly vaccination and birth data from the DATASUS (Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System) database of the Ministry of Health of Brazil were obtained from January 2017 to December 2020. Interrupted time series analysis was used to compare vaccination trends before and after March 2020, when isolation measures were first implemented in Brazil. RESULTS: There was no strong evidence of a significant change in trends during the study period, or before and during the pandemic at national level. However, the mean number of vaccinations per child was 10.6, which is lower than the 13 doses expected under the immunization schedule. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pandemic did not appreciably impact on vaccinations, incomplete immunization among children aged <1 year in Brazil is cause for concern. A potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific antigens or regional and sociodemographic disparities in vaccinations cannot be ruled out without further research.","Alves, João Guilherme; Figueiroa, José Natal; Urquia, Marcelo Luis",Int J Infect Dis,,247

Organisations have been forced into rapid 'big bang' introduction of technology and 'tech-driven' practices in an unprecedented and time pressured manner. In many cases there has been little training or reflection on how the practices and associated technology should be introduced and integrated or adapted to suit the new workplace context. We argue that there is a need for a more reflective 'normalisation' of work practices and the role technology plays. The paper draws on normalisation process theory (NPT) and its underlying components of cohesion, cognitive participation, collective action and reflexive monitoring. As an exemplar, we focus on the changing nature of work and adoption of remote working practices. The paper uses NPT to examine current thinking and approaches and offering some guidelines to inform research and practice.","Carroll, Noel; Conboy, Kieran",Int J Inf Manage,,247

204216,COVID-19 and APOL1: Understanding Disease Mechanisms through Clinical Observation,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically changed the routine way of life and challenged the ways in which health and dental services are provided. During the 1st lockdown, practiced in most of the countries, routine dental procedures were suspended. Even after the lockdown was eased, visiting crowded dental clinics was still considered health-threatening, especially among populations at high risk of developing a severe reaction to COVID-19. Regretfully, in most cases, temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and bruxism were not included under the definition of emergency, leaving many patients without the possibility of consulting their dentists. A literature search, performed about 10 months after the declaration of the pandemic, found only a few studies dealing with TMD and bruxism during COVID-19. Most of the studies indicate adverse effects on subjects' psycho-emotional status (stress, anxiety, depression), which in turn lead to the intensification of subjects' TMD and bruxism symptoms, and increased orofacial pain. Unlike other oral pathologies, which require manual interventions, chronic orofacial pain can be addressed, at least at its initial stage, through teledentistry and/or consultation. Remote first aid for patients suffering from orofacial pain includes various kinds of treatment, such as the self-massage of tense and painful areas, stretching, thermotherapy, drug therapy, relaxation techniques, meditation, and mindfulness, all of which can be administered through the phone and/or the Internet. Relevant legal and ethical issues should be considered while using remote modes for the triage, diagnosis and treatment of chronic orofacial pain patients.","Emodi-Perlman, Alona; Eli, Ilana",Dent Med Probl,,247

This has led to considering new and unusual targets for SARS CoV-2. 2′-O-Methyltransferase (nsp16) is a key and attractive target in the SARS CoV-2 life cycle since it is responsible for the viral RNA protection via a cap formation process. In this study, we propose a new potential inhibitor for SARS COV-2 2′-O-methyltransferase (nsp16). A fragment library was screened against the co-crystal structure of the SARS COV-2 2′-O-methyltransferase complexed with Sinefungin (nsp16-PDB ID: 6WKQ), and consequently the best proposed fragments were linked via a de novo approach to build molecule AP-20. Molecule AP-20 displayed a superior docking score to Sinefungin and reproduced the key interactions in the binding site of 2′-O-methyltransferase. Three molecular dynamic simulations of the 2′-O-methyltransferase apo structure and its complexed forms with AP-20 and Sinefungin were performed for 150 nano-seconds to provide insights on the dynamic nature of such setups and to assess the stability of the proposed AP-20/enzyme complex. AP-20/enzyme complex demonstrated better stability for the ligand-enzyme complex compared to Sinefungin in a respective setup. Furthermore, MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations showed a better profile for AP-20/enzyme complex compared to Sinefungin/enzyme complex emphasizing the potential inhibitory effect of AP-20 on SARS COV-2 2′-O-methyltransferase. We endorse our designed molecule AP-20 to be further explored via experimental evaluations to confront the spread of the emerging COVID-19. Also, in silico ADME profiling has ascribed to AP-20 an excellent safety and metabolic stability profile. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","El Hassab, M. A.; Ibrahim, T. M.; Shoun, A.

As a result of this situation, the follow-up of such chronic diseases as dementia may be at risk. Similarly, neuropsychiatric complications related to lockdown measures may also be neglected; Argentina's lockdown has been the longest implemented in Latin America. This study aims to determine the frequency of the different types of medical consultations for neurocognitive disorders and the predictors for requiring consultation since the beginning of the lockdown. METHODS: We performed a descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study based on data collected through an online survey. RESULTS: Data were collected on 324 participants, with 165 (50.9%) having had at least one medical consultation. Consultations were held by telephone in 109 cases (33.6%), by e-mail in 62 (19.1%), by video conference in 30 (9.3%), and at the emergency department in 23 (7.1%). Predictors of requiring consultation were Clinical Dementia Rating scores &#8805;1 (P<.001) and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (P=.017). Higher Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores were found in the group of respondents who did require medical consultation (P<.001), but no significant differences were found between groups for Zarit Burden Interview scores. CONCLUSION: We identified a high prevalence of behavioural disorders and caregiver burden during lockdown. Nevertheless, only 50% of respondents had sought medical consultation (by telephone or email in 52.7% of cases).

To date, there are no medical treatments for COVID-19 with proven effectiveness. Novel treatments and/or vaccines will take time to be developed and distributed to patients. In light of this, there has been growing interest in the use of existing medications, such as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), as potential treatments of this disease. AIM: To establish the current evidence for the effectiveness of CQ and HCQ in treating COVID-19. DESIGN & SETTING: A rapid review of the literature was conducted. METHOD: Electronic searches in PubMed and Google Scholar were conducted on 21 March 2020. A further search was conducted in Google for relevant literature on 28 March 2020. RESULTS: There is limited evidence of in vitro activity of CQ/HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. A number of in vivo clinical trials are underway. The empirical data available from two of these trials reveal conflicting results. Both trials are characterised by small numbers of participants (n = 30 and n = 36) and suffer methodological limitations. No medium or long-term follow-up data is available. CONCLUSION: At present, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether CQ/HCQ are safe and effective treatments for COVID-19. High quality, adequately powered randomised clinical trials in primary and secondary care settings are urgently required to guide policymakers and clinicians. These studies should report medium- and long-term follow-up results, and safety data.","Gbinigie, Kome; Frie, Kerstin",,,247

METHODS: A k-means clustering method is proposed to group voxels with similar SAR behaviors in the scanned object, providing a controlled upper-bounded estimation of peak local SARs. This k-means compression model and the conventional virtual observation point (VOP) model were tested in a pTx MRI framework. The pTx pulse design with different SAR controlling schemes was simulated using a numerical human head model and an eight-channel 7T coil array. Multiple criteria (including RF power, global and peak local SARs, and excitation accuracy) were compared for the performance testing. RESULTS: The k-means compression model generated a narrower overestimation bound, leading to a more accurate local SAR estimation. Among different pTx pulse design approaches, the k-means compression model showed the best trade-off between the SAR and excitation accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The developed SAR compression model is advantageous for pTx framework given the narrower overestimation bound and control over the compression ratio. Results also illustrate that a moderate increase of maximum RF power can be useful for reducing the maximum local SAR deposition.","Mao, Xianglun; Bari, Sumra; Love, David J; Rispoli, Joseph V",Magn.

208037,The assessment of patients undergoing cardiac surgery for Covid-19: Complications occurring during cardiopulmonary bypass,2021,"Even though chemotherapy and immunotherapy emerged to limit continual and unregulated proliferation of cancer cells, currently available therapeutic agents are associated with high toxicity levels and low success rates. Additionally, ongoing multi-targeted therapies are limited only for few carcinogenesis pathways, due to continually emerging and evolving mutations of proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressive genes. CRISPR/Cas9, as a specific gene-editing tool, is used to correct causative mutations with minimal toxicity, but is also employed as an adjuvant to immunotherapy to achieve a more robust immunological response. Some of the most critical limitations of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology include off-target mutations, resulting in nonspecific restrictions of DNA upstream of the Protospacer Adjacent Motifs (PAM), ethical agreements, and the lack of a scientific consensus aiming at risk evaluation. Currently, CRISPR/Cas9 is tested on animal models to enhance genome editing specificity and induce a stronger anti-tumor response. Moreover, ongoing clinical trials use the CRISPR/Cas9 system in immune cells to modify genomes in a target-specific manner. Recently, error-free in vitro systems have been engineered to overcome limitations of this gene-editing system. The aim of the article is to present the knowledge concerning the use of CRISPR Cas9 technique in targeting treatment-resistant cancers. Additionally, the use of CRISPR/Cas9 is aided as an emerging supplementation of immunotherapy, currently used in experimental oncology. Demonstrating further, applications and advances of the CRISPR/Cas9 technique are presented in animal models and human clinical trials.

Biomarkers were screened out of hematological parameters for risk stratification. METHOD: Confirmed COVID-19 adult patients in Suzhou were included. The patient data was collected, and the results of laboratory examinations were compared between the mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 groups. A ROC was calculated to compare the diagnostic performance of candidate indexes, and dynamic levels of hematological indexes were compared between the two groups. RESULT: 75 patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 46.6â¯±â¯14â¯years, and 45 patients were male. All patients were classified into two groups: the mild/moderate group and the severe group. WBC, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels of the severe group were significantly higher (Pâ¯<â¯0.05) than the mild/moderate, and the lymphocyte was lower. The ROC test showed that the hematological parameters had a larger AUC than that of inflammatory factors. There was a significant difference in lymphocyte and fibrinogen levels between the two groups on day 1 (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). However, NLR of the severe group was higher than the mild/moderate on days 1, 4 and 14 (Pâ¯<â¯0.01), and so was D-dimer on days 1, 7 and 14 (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). CONCLUSION: The common COVID-19 abnormal hematological indexes on admission included hyperfibrinogenemia, lymphopenia, the elevation of D-dimer, and leukopenia, which were significantly different between the mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 groups. Furthermore, the dynamic change of NLR and D-dimer level can distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from the mild/moderate.","Fu, Jianhong; Kong, Jindan; Wang, Wei; Wu, Meiying; Yao, Lin; Wang, Zhaoyue; Jin, Jun; Wu, Depei; Yu, Xin",Thromb Res,,247

209059,Role of pulmonary ultrasound in covid-19 pandemics,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused temporary drops in the supply of organs for transplantation, leading to renewed debate about whether T2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients should receive priority during these times. The aim of this study was to provide a quantitative model to aid decision-making in liver transplantation for T2 HCC. We proposed a novel ethical framework where the individual transplant benefit for a T2 HCC patient should outweigh the harm to others on the waiting list, determining a ""net benefit"", to define appropriate organ allocation. This ethical framework was then translated into a quantitative Markov model including Italian averages for waiting list characteristics, donor resources, mortality, and transplant rates obtained from a national prospective database (n = 8567 patients). The net benefit of transplantation in a T2 HCC patient in a usual situation varied from 0 life months with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 15, to 34 life months with a MELD score of 40, while it progressively decreased with acute organ shortage during a pandemic (i.e., with a 50% decrease in organs, the net benefit varied from 0 life months with MELD 30, to 12 life months with MELD 40). Our study supports the continuation of transplantation for T2 HCC patients during crises such as COVID-19; however, the focus needs to be on those T2 HCC patients with the highest net survival benefit.","Cillo, Umberto; Vitale, Alessandro; Volk, Michael L; Frigo, Anna Chiara; Feltracco, Paolo; Cattelan, Annamaria; Brancaccio, Giuseppina; Feltrin, Giuseppe; Angeli, Paolo; Burra, Patrizia; Lonardi, Sara; Trapani, Silvia; Cardillo, Massimo",,,247
209134,Ambulatory cardiology telemedicine: a large academic pediatric center experience,2021,"CONTEXT: While the World Health Organization (WHO) has established guidance on COVID-19 surveillance, little is known about implementation of these guidelines in federations, which fragment authority across multiple levels of government. This study examines how subnational governments in federal democracies collect and report data on COVID-19 cases and mortality associated with COVID-19. METHODS: We collected data from subnational government websites in 15 federal democracies to construct indices of COVID-19 data quality. Using bivariate and multivariate regression, we analyzed the relationship between these indices and indicators of state capacity, the decentralization of resources and authority, and the quality of democratic institutions. We supplement these quantitative analyses with qualitative case studies of subnational COVID-19 data in Brazil, Spain, and the United States. FINDINGS: Subnational governments in federations vary in their collection of data on COVID-19 mortality, testing, hospitalization, and demographics. There are statistically significant associations (p<0.05) between subnational data quality and key indicators of public health system capacity, fiscal decentralization, and the quality of democratic institutions. Case studies illustrate the importance of both governmental and civil-society institutions that foster accountability. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of subnational COVID-19 surveillance data in federations depends in part on public health system capacity, fiscal decentralization, and the quality of democracy.","Rocco, Philip; Rich, Jessica A J; Klasa, Katarzyna; Dubin, Kenneth A; Béland, Daniel",J. health polit. policy law,,247

METHODS: We apply a novel health services research approach to systematically assess a sample of 55 institutional websites. The accessibility, content, and coverage of occupational health/safety program information were systematically coded for several domains (e.g., OSHA-related, specific hazards, clinical, person-oriented, COVID-19, and coverage). RESULTS: Information was more available for programs related to OSHA mandates (e.g., chemical hygiene) and specific hazards than for person-oriented programs (e.g., counseling). Larger institutions provide better information and more comprehensive programs than smaller institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Higher education institutions warrant increasing attention to occupational health and safety, particularly as COVID-19 increased attention to workplace health issues.","Malomet, Maayan S; Harber, Philip",J. occup. environ. med,,247
209611,Prognostic implication of hypocalcaemia in COVID-19: a systematic review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Infanticide is not a new concept. It is often confused with child murder, neonaticide, filicide or even genderside. Each of these concepts has to be defined clearly in order to be understood. Through time reasons for infanticide have evolved depending on multiple factors such as culture, religion, beliefs system, or attempts to control the population. It was once seen as a moral virtue. So what has changed? SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between January 2020 and May 2020, a literature search based on electronic bibliographic databases as well as other sources of information (grey literature) was conducted in order to investigate the most recent data on infanticide and child murder, especially the newest socio-economic and psychiatric considerations as well as the different reasons why a mother or a father ends up killing their own child and the Irish situation. RESULTS: Recent works on the subject demonstrate how some new socio economic factors and family considerations impact on infanticide. Mental illness, especially depression and psychosis, is often part of the picture and represent a very high risk factor to commit infanticide and filicide. Fathers and mothers do not proceed the same way nor for the same reasons when they kill their offspring. Neonaticide and infanticide are almost always committed by women. A recent case in Ireland (2020) proves how filicide remains an actual problem. CONCLUSIONS: Filicide is a relatively rare event, and therefore particularly impact both the public and the press when it occurs. Infanticide does not result from a unique cause, but from multiple factors (some being well known, some remaining hypothetical). Psychopathological and socio-economical parameters associated to peculiar family grounds are currently prevalent. To help and prevent infanticide, screening for psychiatric disorders and risk factors and treating or offering assistance to parents at risk should be implemented.","Naviaux, Anne-Frederique; Janne, Pascal; Gourdin, Maximilien",Psychiatr Danub,,247
211364,New therapeutic opportunities for COVID-19 patients with Tocilizumab: Possible correlation of interleukin-6 receptor inhibitors with osteonecrosis of the jaws,2020,"Diagnostic assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 are essential for patient management, infection prevention, and the public health response for COVID-19. The efficacy and reliability of these assays are of paramount importance in both tracking and controlling spread of the virus. Real-time RT-PCR assays rely on a fixed genetic sequence for primers and probe binding. Mutations can potentially alter the accuracy of these assays and lead to unpredictable analytical performance characteristics and false-negative results. Herein, we identify a G-to-U transversion (nucleotide 26372) in the SARS-CoV-2 E gene in three specimens with reduced viral detection efficiency using a widely available commercial assay. Further analysis of the public GISAID repository led to the identification of 18 additional genomes with this mutation, which reflect five independent mutational events. This work supports the use of dual-target assays to reduce the number of false-negative PCR results.","Tahan, Stephen; Parikh, Bijal A; Droit, Lindsay; Wallace, Meghan A; Burnham, C A; Wang, David",J. clin. microbiol,,247

After virus entry in host cells the global organization of the viral life cycle is strongly regulated by the formation of virus-host protein interactions. With the advent of high-throughput -omics platforms, the mirage to obtain a ""high resolution"" view of virus-host interactions has come true. In fact, the rapidly expanding approaches of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics in the study of PPIs provide efficient tools to identify a significant number of potential drug targets. Generation of PPIs maps by affinity purification-MS and by the more recent proximity labeling-MS may help to uncover cellular processes hijacked and/or altered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), providing promising therapeutic targets. The possibility to further validate putative key targets from high-confidence interactions between viral bait and host protein through follow-up MS-based multi-omics experiments offers an unprecedented opportunity in the drug discovery pipeline. In particular, drug repurposing, making use of already existing approved drugs directly targeting these identified and validated host interactors, might shorten the time and reduce the costs in comparison to the traditional drug discovery process. This route might be promising for finding effective antiviral therapeutic options providing a turning point in the fight against the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.","Terracciano, Rosa; Preianò, Mariaimmacolata; Fregola, Annalisa; Pelaia, Corrado; Montalcini, Tiziana; Savino, Rocco",Int. j. mol. sci.

However, SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs is not known in Zambia. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 prevalence survey among Zambian HCWs in twenty health facilities in six districts in July 2020. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for health facility clustering, were calculated for each test separately and a combined measure for those who had PCR and ELISA performed. RESULTS: In total, 660 HCWs participated in the study, with 450 (68.2%) providing nasopharyngeal swab for PCR and 575 (87.1%) providing a blood specimen for ELISA. Sixty-six percent of participants were females and the median age was 31.5 years (interquartile range 26.2-39.8 years). The overall prevalence of the combined measure was 9.3% (95% CI 3.8%-14.7%). PCR-positive prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.6% (95% CI 2.0%-11.1%) and ELISA-positive prevalence was 2.2% (95% CI 0.5%-3.9%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs was similar to a population-based estimate (10.6%) during a period of community transmission in Zambia. Public health measures such as establishing COVID-19 treatment centers before the first cases, screening for COVID-19 symptoms among patients accessing health facilities, infection prevention and control trainings, and targeted distribution of personal protective equipment based on exposure risk might have prevented increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission among Zambian HCWs.","Fwoloshi, Sombo; Hines, Jonas Z; Barradas, Danielle T; Yingst, Samuel; Siwingwa, Mpanji; Chirwa, Lameck; Zulu, James E; Banda, Dabwitso; Wolkon, Adam; Nikoi, Kotey I; Chirwa, Bob; Kampamba, Davies; Shibemba, Aaron; Sivile, Suilanji; Zyambo, Khozya D; Chanda, Duncan; Mupeta, Francis; Kapina, Muzala; Sinyange, Nyambe; Kapata, Nathan; Zulu, Paul M; Makupe, Alex; Mweemba, Aggrey; Mbewe, Nyuma; Ziko, Luunga; Mukonka, Victor; Mulenga, Lloyd B; Malama, Kennedy; Agolory, Simon",Clin. infect. dis,,247
219240,Probiotics and COVID-19: one size does not fit all,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the development of life-threatening COVID-19 are believed to disproportionately affect certain at-risk populations. However, it is not clear whether individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at a higher risk of COVID-19 or its adverse consequences. Recurrent respiratory viral infections are often associated with perturbation and pulmonary exacerbations of CF as evidenced by the significant morbidity observed in CF individuals during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The primary goal of this review was to systematically survey published accounts of COVID-19 in CF and determine if individuals with CF are disproportionally affected by SARS-CoV-2 and development of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search using EMBASE and Medline between April 28 and December 10, 2020. Six evaluable studies reporting on a total of 339 individuals with CF who developed COVID-19 were included in this study. RESULTS: We found that although individuals with CF generally experience acute exacerbations of lung disease from infectious agents, COVID-19 incidence estimates in CF appear to be lower than in the general population. However, there are reports of subsets of CF, such as those who had organ transplants, that may experience a more severe COVID-19 course. Potential protective mechanisms in the CF population include pre-pandemic social isolation practices, infection prevention and control knowledge, altered expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme, and the use of certain medications. CONCLUSIONS: Although individuals with CF are at risk of acute exacerbations often precipitated by respiratory tract viral infections, published evidence to date indicated that individuals with CF do not experience higher risks of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is evidence that some subsets within the CF population, including those post-transplantation, may experience a more severe clinical course. As SARS-CoV-2 variants are identified and the pandemic goes through additional waves of disease outbreaks, ongoing monitoring of the risk of COVID-19 in individuals with CF is required.","Mathew, Hannah R; Choi, May Y; Parkins, Michael D; Fritzler, Marvin J",BMC Pulm Med,,247

Methods: Monthly since January 2021, we tested plasma from 4791 patients receiving dialysis for antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 using a high-throughput assay. We qualitatively assessed the proportion without a detectable RBD response and among those with a response, semiquantitative median IgG index values. Using a nested case-control design, we matched each breakthrough case to five controls by age, sex, and vaccination-month to determine whether peak and pre-breakthrough RBD IgG index values were associated with risk for infection post-vaccination. Results: Among 2563 vaccinated patients, the proportion without a detectable RBD response increased from 6.6% [95% CI 5.5-8.1] in 14-30 days post-vaccination to 20.2% [95% CI 17.1-23.8], and median index values declined from 92.7 (95% CI 77.8-107.5) to 3.7 (95% CI 3.1-4.3) after 5 months. Persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection prior-to-vaccination had higher peak index values than persons without prior infection, but values equalized by 5 months (p=0.230). Breakthrough infections occurred in 56 patients, with samples collected a median of 21 days pre-breakthrough. Peak and pre-breakthrough RBD values <23 (equivalent to <506 WHO BAU/mL) were associated with higher odds for breakthrough infection (OR: 3.7 [95% CI 2.0-6.8] and 9.8 [95% CI 2.9-32.8], respectively). Conclusions: The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination wanes rapidly, and in persons receiving dialysis, the persisting antibody response is associated with risk for breakthrough infection.","Anand, Shuchi; Montez-Rath, Maria E; Han, Jialin; Garcia, Pablo; Cadden, LinaCel; Hunsader, Patti; Morgan, Curt; Kerschmann, Russell; Beyer, Paul; Dittrich, Mary; Block, Geoffrey A; Chertow, Glenn M; Parsonnet, Julie",,,247

This study investigated the mental state and attitudes of older Chinese adults during this epidemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online surveys on a convenience sample of China's general population at two different time points. Online surveys were disseminated through popular Chinese social media applications. Adults 18 or older living in China during the initial (N = 1148) and second stages (N=470) were included in the survey. The Worries, Strategies, and Confidence Questionnaire (WSQ) was created to assess worries and awareness of the disease. RESULTS: Combined responses (N=1618), 76.1% were female and about 7.0% were 60 years or above. In the first wave, older adults were found less likely to worry about being infected by COVID-19 (p < 0.05) and reported less attention paid to protective measures (p = 0.004) than young adults. However, as the disease evolved, older participants in the second wave were more worried than young adults (p = 0.027) and older adults in the first wave (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During the epidemic of COVID-19, watchfulness of the epidemic among older Chinese adults fluctuated over time. Initially they were slow to respond proactively, but their worries gradually increased. Health care and social service professionals need to address the vulnerabilities of older adults to this public health crisis. This article is protected by copyright.

However, less is known about the effects of ACEs on happiness and the role of mindfulness in this relation. This study examined the relationships between ACEs and happiness and whether mindfulness mediated the effects of ACEs on happiness in a sample of Chinese college students. The data were collected from 1871 college students from 12 colleges across China in September 2020. The findings of this study show that ACEs had significant negative effects on students' happiness and that mindfulness helped to substantially reduce the negative effects of ACEs on happiness. Students who experienced emotional neglect and abuse in childhood were affected the most. By contrast, this group is not the primary focus of mindfulness-based interventions in existing literature; thus, this study calls for specific mindfulness-based interventions for this vulnerable population.","Huang, Chien-Chung; Chen, Yafan; Cheung, Shannon; Hu, Hongwei; Wang, Enjian",Child &amp; family social work,,247

This is demonstrated through the National Security Act and also by the country’s defense expenditure as a component of its GDP. Defense expenditure routinely takes the second largest share of GDP in Botswana. The outbreak of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-COV-2) or COVID-19, however, suggests a relook at Botswana’s national security towards none traditional security threats- in this case pandemics. The case for this is made clear by the evidently poor readiness to deal with possible mass infections both from a health budgetary perspective, and the availability of medical personal and equipment. This paper argues for securitisation of health care in Botswana- especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is possible through diversion of a portion current defense spending towards health care.","Ookeditse, Lawrence",Afr. Secur. Rev.,,247

The external validation of their performance is needed before use in clinical routine practice. Our study aims at assessing the analytical and clinical performance of two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests detecting antibodies directed against the virus nucleocapsid protein: The NovaLisa SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) test (NovaTec) allowing a separate detection of each antibody and the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab test (Bio-Rad) detecting total antibodies (IgM, IgA, and IgG). Two-hundred and eight coronavirus disease 2019 samples from 48 quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) confirmed patients were used to perform the sensitivity analysis. Non-SARS-CoV-2 sera (n = 79) with a potential cross-reaction to SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays were included in the specificity analysis. In addition, using receiver operator characteristic curves, adapted cut-off for improvement of the performances were proposed. The kinetics of these antibodies was also assessed over 8 weeks. Two weeks after the RT-qPCR positive detection, the NovaLisa test shows a sensitivity and specificity of 94.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83.1%-98.6%) and 96.2% (95% CI: 89.4%-98.7%) for IgG, of 89.7% (95% CI: 76.4%-95.9%) and 98.7% (95% CI: 93.2%-98.8%) for IgA, and of 48.7% (95% CI: 33.9%-63.8%) and 98.7% (95% CI: 93.2%-99.8%) for IgM. With the Platelia system, the specificity and sensitivity were 97.4% (95% CI: 92.1%-99.7%) and 94.9% (95% CI: 87.7%-98.0%) for total antibodies using the adapted cut-offs. The NovaLisa and the Platelia tests have satisfactory analytical performances. The clinical performances are excellent for IgG, IgA, and total antibodies especially if the cut-off is optimized.","Tré-Hardy, Marie; Wilmet, Alain; Beukinga, Ingrid; Favresse, Julien; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Douxfils, Jonathan; Blairon, Laurent",J. med. virol,,247

222117,"An alternative start regimen with aripiprazole once-monthly in patients with schizophrenia: population pharmacokinetic analysis of a single-day, two-injection start with gluteal and/or deltoid intramuscular injection",2021,"Introduction Le confinement et le contexte sanitaire liés au COVID-19 peuvent entrainer une peur, une anxiété ou des troubles psychologiques s’apparentant à un syndrome de stress post traumatique (SSPT). Les patients traités pour un cancer apparaissent d’autant plus à risque de SSPT qu’ils doivent faire face à la fois à leur pathologie grave et à la peur de développer une forme sévère de COVID-19 dans un contexte social peu favorable pour les soutenir. Dans le cadre de l’étude COVIPACT, notre objectif était de décrire au cours du temps la prévalence des symptômes de SSPT chez les patients atteints de cancer, en lien avec des caractéristiques cliniques (date de diagnostic de cancer, traitements, adaptations de prise en charge liées à la pandémie COVID-19) et des mesures d’état de santé auto-déclarées (qualité de vie, insomnie et cognition). Méthodes L’étude COVIPACT (NCT04366154) a inclus 734 patients traités pour un cancer solide ou hématologique et reçus en hôpital de jour pendant la première période de confinement dans les deux Centres de lutte contre le cancer de Normandie. Les données cliniques ont été recueillies dans les dossiers médicaux. Des questionnaires validés ont permis de mesurer le stress post-traumatique (défini par un score à l’échelle IES-R ≥33), la qualité de vie (FACT-G, échelle 0-108), l’insomnie (ISI, échelle 0-28) et la cognition (FACT-Cog PCI, échelle 0-72) à l’inclusion (pendant le premier confinement, avril/mai 2020), à trois mois (déconfinement, juillet/août 2020) et à six mois (pendant le deuxième confinement, octobre/novembre 2020). Les facteurs associés au SSPT à l’inclusion et à son évolution au cours du temps ont été recherchés par des modèles de régression logistique à effets fixes et mixtes (prenant en compte la corrélation intra-individuelle entre mesures répétées). Résultats Les 578 (79 %) patients COVIPACT ayant répondu aux questionnaires à l’inclusion avaient en médiane 64 ans et 72 % étaient des femmes. Près de 95 % des patients présentaient une tumeur solide, dont la localisation primitive était principalement le sein (44 %), les poumons, la tête et le cou (20 %), le système digestif (17 %) et l’appareil génital féminin (11 %) et dont 59 % avaient un cancer métastatique. Un SSPT a été observé chez 21,3 % des patients au premier confinement (n=120/565), 13,6 % des patients au moment du déconfinement (n=46/339) et 23,5 % des patients durant le deuxième confinement (n=76/322 ;p&lt;0,001 pour effet du temps sur SSPT). Les femmes et les patients dont la prise en charge avait été adaptée face à la pandémie COVID-19 (ex : report/interruption de cures, télé/visio consultations…) présentaient plus fréquemment un SSPT à l’inclusion (OR [IC 95 %]=2,08 [1,26-3,56] et 1,75 [1,12-2,70], respectivement), mais pas au cours du suivi. Aucune autre variable clinique n’était associée au SSPT ou à son évolution. A tous les temps, les patients exprimant un SSPT avaient aussi plus d’insomnie (ISI médian chez les patients avec versus sans SSPT =15 versus 7 à l’inclusion, 15 versus 8 à trois mois, 16 versus 8 à six mois), une moindre qualité de vie (FACT-G médian=61 versus 79, 63 versus 79, 60 versus 80) et une moindre cognition perçue (FACT-Cog PCI=52 versus 66, 55 versus 63, 47 versus 65 à l’inclusion, trois mois et six mois respectivement). Conclusion Pendant les périodes de confinement liées à la COVID-19, un SSPT se manifeste chez plus d’un patient sur cinq en cours de prise en charge d’un cancer, et est fortement relié à la qualité de vie, au sommeil et à la cognition perçus.","Lefevre-Arbogast, S.; Joly, F.; Clarisse, B.; Lequesne, J.",Revue d&#039;Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,,247

METHODS: Here, in multiple, large cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we have studied the intersections between Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), intestinal inflammation, and IBD treatment. RESULTS: A striking expression of ACE2 on the small bowel enterocyte brush border supports intestinal infectivity by SARS-CoV-2. Commonly used IBD medications, both biologic and nonbiologic, do not significantly impact ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptor expression in the uninflamed intestines. In addition, we have defined molecular responses to COVID-19 infection that are also enriched in IBD, pointing to shared molecular networks between COVID-19 and IBD. CONCLUSIONS: These data generate a novel appreciation of the confluence of COVID-19- and IBD-associated inflammation and provide mechanistic insights supporting further investigation of specific IBD drugs in the treatment of COVID-19.

The system is transparent and enables each voter to verify that the tally includes their ballot selection without requiring any understanding of cryptography. This paper describes the system and its use in fall 2020, to vote remotely in promotion committees in a university. Each voter fills out a form in the cloud with their vote V (YES, NO, ABSTAIN) and a passphrase P-two words entered by the voter. The system generates a verification prompt of the (P,V) pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their (P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system would not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be likely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was well-accepted, performed effectively for its intended purpose, and introduced users to the concept of voter-verified elections. Compared to the commonly-used alternatives of paper ballots or voting by email, voters found the system easier to use, and that it provided greater privacy and outcome integrity.","Blanchard, Enka; Robucci, Ryan; Selker, Ted; Sherman, Alan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07180v1.pdf,247

To do so, we rely on longitudinal household survey data from Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria and Uganda, originating from pre-COVID-19 face-to-face household surveys plus phone surveys implemented during the pandemic. We estimate that 256 million individuals-77% of the population-live in households that have lost income during the pandemic. Attempts to cope with this loss are exacerbated by food insecurity and an inability to access medicine and staple foods. Finally, we find that student-teacher contact has dropped from a pre-COVID-19 rate of 96% to just 17% among households with school-aged children.

225040,Use of RAAS Inhibitors and Risk of Clinical Deterioration in COVID-19: Results From an Italian Cohort of 133 Hypertensives,2020,"An ongoing global pandemic of viral pneumonia (coronavirus disease [COVID-19]), due to the virus SARS-CoV-2, has infected millions of people and remains a threat to many more. Most critically ill patients have respiratory failure and there is an international effort to understand mechanisms and predictors of disease severity. Coagulopathy, characterized by elevations in D-dimer and fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDPs), is associated with critical illness and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, increasing reports of microvascular and macrovascular thrombi suggest that hemostatic imbalances may contribute to the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We review the laboratory and clinical findings of patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, and prior studies of hemostasis in other viral infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome. We hypothesize that an imbalance between coagulation and inflammation may result in a hypercoagulable state. Although thrombosis initiated by the innate immune system is hypothesized to limit SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, aberrant activation of this system can cause endothelial injury resulting in loss of thromboprotective mechanisms, excess thrombin generation, and dysregulation of fibrinolysis and thrombosis. The role various components including neutrophils, neutrophil extracellular traps, activated platelets, microparticles, clotting factors, inflammatory cytokines, and complement play in this process remains an area of active investigation and ongoing clinical trials target these different pathways in COVID-19.","Colling, Meaghan E; Kanthi, Yogendra",Vasc Med,,247

However, zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) have been shown to exert protective effects due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties. Therefore, it is hypothesized that supplementation with Zn and Cu alone or as an adjuvant may be beneficial with promising efficacy and a favorable safety profile to mitigate symptoms, as well as halt progression of the severe form of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective of this review is to discuss the proposed underlying molecular mechanisms and their implications for combating SARS-CoV-2 infection in response to Zn and Cu administration. Several clinical trials have also included the use of Zn as an adjuvant therapy with dietary regimens/antiviral drugs against COVID-19 infection. Overall, this review summarizes that nutritional intervention with Zn and Cu may offer an alternative treatment strategy by eliciting their virucidal effects through several fundamental molecular cascades, such as, modulation of immune responses, redox signaling, autophagy, and obstruction of viral entry and genome replication during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Rani, Isha; Goyal, Anmol; Bhatnagar, Mini; Manhas, Sunita; Goel, Parul; Pal, Amit; Prasad, Rajendra",Nutr Res,,247

228011,Occupational safety in the treatment of COVID-19 patients,2020,"Presently, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has been spreading throughout the world. Some drugs such as lopinavir, simeprevir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and amprenavir have been recommended for COVID-19 treatment by some researchers, but these drugs were not effective enough against this virus. This study based on in silico approaches was aimed to increase the anti-COVID-19 activities of these drugs by using caulerpin and its derivatives as an adjunct drug against SARS-CoV-2 receptor proteins: the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Caulerpin exhibited antiviral activities against chikungunya virus and herpes simplex virus type 1. Caulerpin and some of its derivatives showed inhibitory activity against Alzheimer's disease. The web server ANCHOR revealed higher protein stability for the two receptors with disordered score (< 0.6). Molecular docking analysis showed that the binding energies of most of the caulerpin derivatives were higher than all the suggested drugs for the two receptors. Also, we deduced that inserting NH2, halogen, and vinyl groups can increase the binding affinity of caulerpin toward 6VYB and 6LU7, while inserting an alkyl group decreases the binding affinity of caulerpin toward 6VYB and 6LU7. So, we can modify the inhibitory effect of caulerpin against 6VYB and 6LU7 by inserting NH2, halogen, and vinyl groups. Based on the protein disordered results, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein domain are highly stable proteins, so it is quite difficult to unstabilize their integrity by using individual drugs. Also, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation indicates that binding of the combination therapy of simeprevir and the candidate studied compounds to the receptors was stable and had no major effect on the flexibility of the protein throughout the simulations and provided a suitable basis for our study. So, this study suggested that caulerpin and its derivatives could be used as a combination therapy along with lopinavir, simeprevir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and amprenavir for disrupting the stability of SARS-CoV2 receptor proteins to increase the antiviral activity of these drugs.","Ahmed, Shimaa A; Abdelrheem, Doaa A; El-Mageed, H R Abd; Mohamed, Hussein S; Rahman, Aziz A; Elsayed, Khaled N M; Ahmed, Sayed A",Struct Chem,,247
228142,"Epidemiologic, Clinical, and Laboratory Findings of the COVID-19 in the current pandemic",2020,"OBJECTIVES: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 has posed significant limitations and barriers to providing in-person healthcare. We aim to provide a summary of learned experiences and important considerations for implementing and offering telehealth to provide laryngology subspecialty care during the COVID-19 pandemic and thereafter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four laryngologists and a voice-specialized speech-language pathologist from a tertiary-care academic Voice and Swallowing Center were engaged in a structured group consensus conference. Participants shared input, experiences, and practice patterns employed via telemedicine (via telephone or video-communication) during the early COVID-19 era. RESULTS: Key identified areas of consideration when offering telemedicine included (1) how to set up and structure a telemedicine visit and maintain patient confidentiality, (2) patient examination and treatment initiation, (3) optimization of the tele-visit, (4) limitations and recognition of when a tele-visit is insufficient for patient care needs, (5) billing/reimbursement considerations. Group consensus for the aforementioned topics is summarized and discussed. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a telemedicine model can be effectively employed to improve patient access to subspecialty laryngology care, including a multidisciplinary care approach, with initiation of various therapeutic interventions. A major limitation given the preclusion of in-person assessment is the lack of access to laryngoscopy, which can likely be delayed safely in the majority of individuals.","Strohl, Madeleine P; Dwyer, Christopher D; Ma, Yue; Rosen, Clark A; Schneider, Sarah L; Young, VyVy N",J. voice,,247

229224,COVID-19 associated Aspergillosis,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Almonertinib (HS-10296) is a novel, third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that targets both EGFR-sensitizing and T790M resistance mutations. This first-in-human trial aimed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of almonertinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that had progressed after prior EGFR-TKI therapy. METHODS: This phase I, open-label, multicenter clinical trial (NCT0298110) included dose-escalation (55, 110, 220 and 260 mg) and dose-expansion cohorts (55, 110 and 220 mg) with once-daily oral administration of almonertinib. In each expansion cohort, tumor biopsies were obtained for determination of EGFR T790M status. The safety, tolerability, anti-tumor activity and pharmacokinetics of almonertinib were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients (26 patients in the dose-escalation cohort and 94 patients in the dose-expansion cohort) were enrolled. The maximum tolerated dose was not defined in the dose-escalation phase; the 260 mgregimen was not further evaluated in the dose-expansion phase due to safety concerns and saturation of exposure. The most common treatment-related grade &#8805;3 adverse events were increased blood creatine phosphokinase (10%) and increased alanine aminotransferase (3%). Among 94 patients with the EGFR T790M mutation in the dose-expansion cohort, the investigator-assessed objective response rate and disease control rate were 52% (95%CI: 42-63) and 92% (95%CI: 84â¼96), respectively. Median progressionâ¼free survival was 11.0 months (95%CI: 9.5â¼not reached) months. CONCLUSIONS: Almonertinib is safe, tolerable and effective for patients with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC harboring the EGFR T790M mutation who were pre-treated with EGFR-TKIs.","Chih-Hsin Yang, James; Camidge, D Ross; Yang, Cheng-Ta; Zhou, Jianying; Guo, Renhua; Chiu, Chao-Hua; Chang, Gee-Chen; Shiah, Her-Shyong; Chen, Yuan; Wang, Chin-Chou; Berz, David; Su, Wu-Chou; Yang, Nong; Wang, Ziping; Fang, Jian; Chen, Jianhua; Nikolinakos, Petros; Lu, You; Pan, Hongming; Maniam, Ajit; Bazhenova, Lyudmila; Shirai, Keisuke; Jahanzeb, Mohammad; Willis, Maurice; Masood, Nehal; Chowhan, Naveed; Hsia, Te-Chun; Jian, Hong; Lu, Shun",J. thorac. oncol,,247

According to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) Global Status Report on Blood Safety and Availability, none of the West African countries met the WHO benchmark of 10 blood units per 1000 inhabitants. This study is aimed at discussing the blood transfusion status of West African countries in the pre-COVID-19 period and analyze the capacity to respond to the COVID-19 blood crisis, as well as to outline the panacea. METHODS: Secondary data were extracted from published reports, journal articles and web pages, reviewed and analyzed. RESULT: All the West African countries have recorded confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. The confirmed cases have reached 55,697, with 1069 deaths and a fatality rate of 1.9%, as of June 17, 2020. The assessed countries lagged in most of the WHO benchmarks for effective blood transfusion services. CONCLUSION: Blood transfusion services in the West African region lacked the basic benchmark practice and policy, are not coordinated and may find it hard to tackle the blood transfusion crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Okoroiwu, Henshaw Uchechi; Okafor, Ifeyinwa Maryann; Asemota, Enosakhare Aiyudubie; Ogar, Christopher Ogar; Uchendu, Ikenna Kingsley","Hematol., Transfus.

After intravenous infusion, RDV is rapidly metabolized (T1/2 1h) within the cells to its active adenosine triphosphate analogue form (GS-443902) and, then, it can be found in plasma in its nucleoside analogue form (GS-441524). In this real life study we describe the Remdesivir and GS-441524 concentrations at 3 time points in nine ICU patients, through a validated UHPLC-MS/MS method. The observed data confirmed the very rapid conversion of RDV to its metabolite and the quite long half-life of GS-441524. The mean Cmin , Cmax , AUC0-24 , were < 0.24 ng/mL and 122.3 ng/ml, 2637,3 ng/mL and 157,8 ng/ml, 5171.2 ng*h/mL and 3676.5 ng*h/ml respectively for RDV and GS-441524. Three out of nine patients achieved a Cmax > 2610 ng/mL and 140 ng/mL and AUC0-24 > 1560 ng*h/mL and 2230 ng*h/mL for RDV and GS-441524, respectively. The mean T1/2 value for GS-441524 was 26.3 h. Although the low number of patients, these data can represent an interesting preliminary report of the variability of RDV and GS-441524 concentrations in real-life ICU setting.","Corcione, Silvia; De Nicolò, Amedeo; Montrucchio, Giorgia; Scabini, Silvia; Avataneo, Valeria; Bonetto, Chiara; Mornese Pinna, Simone; Cusato, Jessica; Canta, Francesca; Urbino, Rosario; Di Perri, Giovanni; Brazzi, Luca; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; D039,; Avolio, Antonio",,,247

We investigated the impact of social distancing practiced during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the incidence of selected VPDs in South Korea. National surveillance data on monthly incidence of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, varicella, mumps, invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), and pertussis were retrieved and compared the VPD incidences in 2020 to the average of the last 4 years (2015-2019) of the corresponding months. In 2020, there were 44% decline for mumps, 44% decline for varicella, 28% decline for pertussis, 22% decline for IPD, 14% decline in incidence of hepatitis A, and no change for hepatitis B incidences, compared to baseline years (2015-2019). The largest decline of total VPDs was in April (65%) and in May (67%), during the intensified social distancing measures. In the setting of sustained vaccination coverage, social distancing may provide additional public health benefit in controlling the VPDs.","Yun, Hyo Eun; Ryu, Bo Young; Choe, Young June",J. med. virol,,247

We found a significant positive correlation between population influx from Wuhan and confirmed cases in other cities across China (R2 = 0.85, P < 0.001), especially cities in Hubei (R2 = 0.88, P < 0.001). Removing the travel restriction would have increased 118% (91%-172%) of the overall cases for the coming week, and a travel ban taken three days or a week earlier would have reduced 47% (26%-58%) and 83% (78%-89%) of the early cases. We would expect a 61% (48%-92%) increase of overall cumulative cases without any restrictions on returning residents, and 11% (8%-16%) increase if the travel ban stays in place for Hubei.

234165,Guideline for the management of hip fractures 2020: Guideline by the Association of Anaesthetists,2020,"Proteases catalyse irreversible posttranslational modifications that often alter a biological function of the substrate. The protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is a pharmacological target in type 2 diabetes therapy primarily because it inactivates glucagon-like protein-1. DPP4 also has roles in steatosis, insulin resistance, cancers and inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. In addition, DPP4 binds to the spike protein of the MERS virus, causing it to be the human cell surface receptor for that virus. DPP4 has been identified as a potential binding target of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, so this question requires experimental investigation. Understanding protein structure and function requires reliable protocols for production and purification. We developed such strategies for baculovirus generated soluble recombinant human DPP4 (residues 29-766) produced in insect cells. Purification used differential ammonium sulphate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, dye affinity chromatography in series with immobilised metal affinity chromatography, and ion-exchange chromatography. The binding affinities of DPP4 to the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) were measured using surface plasmon resonance and ELISA. This optimised DPP4 purification procedure yielded 1 to 1.8 mg of pure fully active soluble DPP4 protein per litre of insect cell culture with specific activity >30 U/mg, indicative of high purity. No specific binding between DPP4 and CoV-2 spike protein was detected by surface plasmon resonance or ELISA. In summary, a procedure for high purity high yield soluble human DPP4 was achieved and used to show that, unlike MERS, SARS-CoV-2 does not bind human DPP4.","Xi, Cecy R; Di Fazio, Arianna; Nadvi, Naveed Ahmed; Patel, Karishma; Xiang, Michelle Sui Wen; Zhang, Hui Emma; Deshpande, Chandrika; Low, Jason K K; Wang, Xiaonan Trixie; Chen, Yiqian; McMillan, Christopher L D; Isaacs, Ariel; Osborne, Brenna; Vieira de Ribeiro, Ana Júlia; McCaughan, Geoffrey W; Mackay, Joel P; Church, W Bret; Gorrell, Mark D",Molecules (Basel),,247

The current study set-out to model the complex interrelations between PTSD symptoms during the peak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak in 291 Chinese healthcare workers and 291 matched control cases that were selected from the general population. For this purpose, we estimated regularized partial correlation networks. Within the network of healthcare workers, we observed a central role for avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, physiological cue reactivity, anger/irritability, re-experiencing, and startle. We identified three clusters of closely interconnected PTSD symptoms in healthcare workers, consisting of (a) symptoms of re-experiencing and anxious arousal, (b) symptoms of avoidance and amnesia and (c) symptoms of emotional numbing and dysphoric arousal. Respectively, startle, avoidance of reminders and feeling detached emerged as bridging nodes in these communities. Although yielding highly similar network models, the PTSD symptom structure of healthcare workers showed several unique features compared to the matched control sample. This is informative for interventions aimed at targeting PTSD symptoms in healthcare workers in the context of a public health emergency.","Hoorelbeke, Kristof; Sun, Xiaoxiao; Koster, Ernst H W; Dai, Qin",Stress health (Online),,247

This study investigated the IPV help-seeking messages disseminated by the Spanish-speaking media in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. We engaged in an exploratory content analysis of videos from Univision's main website, the most-watched Spanish-speaking media network in the U.S. We searched for videos related to IPV help-seeking posted from March 19-April 21, 2020-including the weeks after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the U.S. mandated a shelter-in-place. After assessing inclusion criteria, 29 videos were analyzed. Data were analyzed using basic content analysis to determine frequencies and inductive interpretive content analysis to code for help-seeking messages. We identified eight manifest messages related to seeking help when experiencing IPV in times of a crisis: (1) contact a professional resource; (2) contact law enforcement; (3) contact family, friends, and members of your community; (4) create a safety plan; (5) don't be afraid, be strong; (6) leave the situation; (7) protect yourself at home; and (8) services are available despite the pandemic. We found that the manifest messages alluded to three latent messages: (1) it is your responsibility to change your circumstances; (2) you are in danger and in need of protection; and (3) you are not alone. IPV and media professionals should ensure a structural understanding of IPV in their help-seeking messages and avoid perpetrating stigmatizing and reductionist messages.","Alvarez-Hernandez, Luis R; Cardenas, Iris; Bloom, Allison",J Fam Violence,,247

The measures to contain infection taken by many governments have been extremely severe by imposing home lockdown and industrial production shutdown, making this the biggest crisis since the second world war. Additionally, the continuous colonization of wild natural lands may touch unknown virus reservoirs, causing the spread of epidemics. Apart from SARS-Cov-2, the recent history has seen the spread of several viral pandemics such as H2N2 and H3N3 flu, HIV, and SARS, while MERS and Ebola viruses are considered still in a prepandemic phase. Hard nanomaterials (HNMs) have been recently used as antimicrobial agents, potentially being next-generation drugs to fight viral infections. HNMs can block infection at early (disinfection, entrance inhibition) and middle (inside the host cells) stages and are also able to mitigate the immune response. This review is focused on the application of HNMs as antiviral agents. In particular, mechanisms of actions, biological outputs, and limitations for each HNM will be systematically presented and analyzed from a material chemistry point-of-view. The antiviral activity will be discussed in the context of the different pandemic viruses. We acknowledge that HNM antiviral research is still at its early stage, however, we believe that this field will rapidly blossom in the next period.","Reina, Giacomo; Peng, Shiyuan; Jacquemin, Lucas; Andrade, Andrés Felipe; Bianco, Alberto",ACS Nano,,247

Here, we report the case of a patient who developed simultaneous bilateral retinal artery occlusion following COVID-19 infection.Case Report: A 42-year-old male with no systemic co-morbidities presented with sudden, painless loss of vision in both eyes. Fundoscopy showed retinal edema and cherry-red spots in both eyes. Fluorescein angiography showed reperfusion, absence of choroidal ischemia, and Optical Coherence Tomography showed thickened inner retinal layers suggestive of retinal edema and the outer retinal layers appeared intact. Blood investigations for vasculitis, coagulation profile, lipids, and homocysteine level were within normal limits.Conclusion: COVID-19 patients may develop a systemic coagulopathy and acquired thrombophilia characterized by a tendency for venous, arterial, and microvascular thrombosis. This hypercoagulable state is believed to be a hyperinflammatory response; physicians and ophthalmologists, alike, should be aware of these possible long-term sequelae.","Bapaye, Maneesh M; Nair, Akshay Gopinathan; Bapaye, Charuta M; Bapaye, Meena M; Shukla, Juilee J",Ocul Immunol Inflamm,,247
243063,Vitamin D binding protein in COVID-19,2020,"Cell-free microRNAs (miRNAs) are transferred in disease state including inflammatory lung diseases and are often packed into extracellular vesicles (EVs). To assess their suitability as biomarkers for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and severe secondary complications such as sepsis, we studied patients with CAP (n = 30), sepsis (n = 65) and healthy volunteers (n = 47) subdivided into a training (n = 67) and a validation (n = 75) cohort. After precipitating crude EVs from sera, associated small RNA was profiled by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and evaluated in multivariate analyses. A subset of the thereby identified biomarker candidates was validated both technically and additionally by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis revealed 29 differentially expressed miRNAs in CAP patients when compared to volunteers, and 25 miRNAs in patients with CAP, compared to those with sepsis. Sparse partial-least discriminant analysis separated groups based on 12 miRNAs. Three miRNAs proved as a significant biomarker signature. While expression levels of miR-1246 showed significant changes with an increase in overall disease severity from volunteers to CAP and to sepsis, miR-193a-5p and miR-542-3p differentiated patients with an infectious disease (CAP or sepsis) from volunteers. Cell-free miRNAs are potentially novel biomarkers for CAP and may help to identify patients at risk for progress to sepsis, facilitating early intervention and treatment.","Hermann, Stefanie; Brandes, Florian; Kirchner, Benedikt; Buschmann, Dominik; Borrmann, Melanie; Klein, Matthias; Kotschote, Stefan; Bonin, Michael; Reithmair, Marlene; Kaufmann, Ines; Schelling, Gustav; Pfaffl, Michael W",J Cell Mol Med,,247

243780,Reply to the letter concerning Kawasaki disease and Covid-19,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present a similar syndrome to an influenza infection, which may complicate diagnosis and clinical management of these two important respiratory infectious diseases, especially during the peak season of influenza. A rapid and convenient point-of-care test (POCT) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus is of great importance for prompt and efficient control of these respiratory epidemics. Herein, a multichannel electrochemical immunoassay (MEIA) platform was developed based on a disposable screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) array for the on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 and A(H1N1). The developed MEIA was constructed with eight channels and allowed rapid detection on a single array. On the SPCE surface, monoclonal antibodies against influenza A(H1N1) hemagglutinin (HA) protein or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were coated to capture the target antigens, which then interacted with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled detection antibody to form an immuno-sandwich complex. The results showed that the MEIA exhibited a broader linear range than ELISA and comparable sensitivity for A(H1N1) HA and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The detection results on 79 clinical samples for A(H1N1) suggested that the proposed MEIA platform showed comparable results with ELISA in sensitivity (with a positive rate of 100% for positive samples) but higher specificity, with a false-positive rate of 5.4% for negative samples versus that of 40.5% with ELISA. Thus, it offers great potential for the on-the-spot differential diagnosis of infected patients, which would significantly benefit the efficient control and prevent the spread of these infectious diseases in communities or resource-limited regions in the future.","Li, Jianyong; Lin, Rui; Yang, Yi; Zhao, Rongtao; Song, Shiping; Zhou, Yi; Shi, Jiye; Wang, Lihua; Song, Hongbin; Hao, Rongzhang",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,,247
243802,A Hypothesis for the Possible Role of Zinc in the Immunological Pathways Related to COVID-19 Infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal (NP) specimen testing by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard of care for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Data comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the NP specimen to the less invasive, mid-turbinate (MT) nasal specimen in children are limited. METHODS: Paired clinical NP and research MT specimens were collected from children <18 years with respiratory symptoms and tested by molecular assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Sensitivity, specificity, and agreement (Cohen's kappa [&#954;]) were calculated for research MT specimens compared to the clinical NP specimens. RESULTS: Out of 907 children, 569 (62.7%) had parental consent and child assent when appropriate to participate and provided paired MT and NP specimens a median of 4 days after symptom onset (range 1-14 days). 16.5% (n = 94) of MT specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with 20.0% (n = 114) of NP specimens. The sensitivity of research MT compared to clinical NP specimens was 82.5% (95% CI: 74.2%, 88.9%), specificity was 100.0% (95% CI: 99.2%, 100.0%), and overall agreement was 96.1% (&#954; = 0.87). The sensitivity of MT specimens decreased with time from 100% (95% CI: 59.0%, 100.0%) on day 1 of illness to 82.1% (95% CI: 73.8%, 88.7%) within 14 days of illness onset; sensitivity was generally >90% when specimens were collected within the first week of illness. CONCLUSION: MT specimens, particularly those collected within the first week of illness, have moderately reduced sensitivity and equivalent specificity to less-tolerated NP specimens in pediatric outpatients. MT specimen use in children may represent a viable alternative to NP specimen collection.","Sahni, Leila C; Avadhanula, Vasanthi; Ortiz, Camerin S; Feliz, Karen E; John, Rebekah E; Brown, Cameron A; Lively, Joana Y; Rha, Brian; Munoz, Flor M; Piedra, Pedro A; Dunn, James J; Boom, Julie A",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,,247

Ultraschall in Med. 2020 Apr 15""",2020,"A music mashup combines audio elements from two or more songs to create a new work. To reduce the time and effort required to make them, researchers have developed algorithms that predict the compatibility of audio elements. Prior work has focused on mixing unaltered excerpts, but advances in source separation enable the creation of mashups from isolated stems (e.g., vocals, drums, bass, etc.). In this work, we take advantage of separated stems not just for creating mashups, but for training a model that predicts the mutual compatibility of groups of excerpts, using self-supervised and semi-supervised methods. Specifically, we first produce a random mashup creation pipeline that combines stem tracks obtained via source separation, with key and tempo automatically adjusted to match, since these are prerequisites for high-quality mashups. To train a model to predict compatibility, we use stem tracks obtained from the same song as positive examples, and random combinations of stems with key and/or tempo unadjusted as negative examples. To improve the model and use more data, we also train on""average""examples: random combinations with matching key and tempo, where we treat them as unlabeled data as their true compatibility is unknown. To determine whether the combined signal or the set of stem signals is more indicative of the quality of the result, we experiment on two model architectures and train them using semi-supervised learning technique. Finally, we conduct objective and subjective evaluations of the system, comparing them to a standard rule-based system.","Huang, Jiawen; Wang, Ju-Chiang; Smith, Jordan B.

METHODS: This was a retrospective multi-centre study, which included patients who sustained fractures between 20 January and 19 February 2020. The collected data included patients' demographics (age and gender), injury-related (injury type, fracture location, injury mechanism, places where fracture occurred), and treatment modality. SPSS 23.0 was used to describe the data and perform some analysis. RESULTS: A total of 436 patients with 453 fractures were included; there were 153 males and 283 females, with an average age of 76.2 years (standard deviation, SD, 7.7 years; 65 to 105). For either males or females, 70-74 years was the most commonly involved age group. A total of 317 (72.7%) patients had their fractures occurring at home. Among 453 fractures, there were 264 (58.3%) hip fractures, accounting for 58.3%. Fall from standing height was the most common cause of fracture, making a proportion of 89.4% (405/453). Most fractures (95.8%, 434/453) were treated surgically, and 4.2% (19/453) were treated by plaster fixation or traction. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was the most used surgical method, taking a proportion of 49.2% (223/453).

We used retrospective longitudinal data from the Cerner COVID-19 de-identified cohort. COVID-19 infected patients with valid repeated values of serum ferritin and D-dimer during hospitalization were used in mixed-effects logistic-regression models. Among 52,411 patients, 28.5% (14,958) had valid serum ferritin and 28.6% (15,005) D-dimer laboratory results. Optimal cutoffs of ferritin (714 ng/mL) and D-dimer (2.1 mg/L) revealed AUCs &#8805; 0.99 for in-hospital mortality. Optimal cutoffs for ferritin (502 ng/mL) and D-dimer (2.0 mg/L) revealed AUCs &#8805; 0.99 for invasive ventilator dependence. Optimal cutoffs for in-house mortality, among females, were lower in serum ferritin (433 ng/mL) and D-dimer (1.9 mg/L) compared to males (740 ng/mL and 2.5 mg/L, respectively). Optimal cutoffs for invasive ventilator dependence, among females, were lower in ferritin (270 ng/mL) and D-dimer (1.3 mg/L) compared to males (860 ng/mL and 2.3 mg/L, respectively). Optimal prognostic cutoffs for serum ferritin and D-dimer require considering the entire trajectory of laboratory values during the disease course. Females have an overall lower optimal cutoff for both serum ferritin and D-dimer. The presented research allows health professionals to predict clinical outcomes and appropriate allocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially early recognition of COVID-19 patients needing higher levels of care.","Qeadan, Fares; Tingey, Benjamin; Gu, Lily Y; Packard, Ashley Hafen; Erdei, Esther; Saeed, Ali I",Viruses,,247

Psychological stress, anxiety and depression are affecting not only COVID-19 patients but also health professionals, and general population. Fear of contracting COVID-19, forced restrictive social measures, and economic hardship are causing mental trauma. Nepal is a developing country from South Asia where the COVID-19 pandemic is still evolving. This online survey has been carried out to understand impact of COVID- 19 on mental health of Nepalese community dwellers. METHODS: The COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) questionnaire adapted from the Shanghai Mental Health Centre was used for online data collection from 11 April-17 May 2020. Collected data were extracted to Microsoft excel-13 and imported and analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version-22. An initial univariate analysis was conducted for all variables to assess the distribution. Logistic regression analyses were done to estimate the odds ratios of relevant predicting variables. RESULTS: A total of 410 participants completed the self-rated questionnaires. Mean age of study participants was 34.8 ± 11.7 years with male preponderance. 88.5% of the respondents were not in distress (score less than 28) while, 11% had mild to moderate distress and 0.5% had severe distress. The prevalence of distress is higher among age group > 45 years, female gender, and post-secondary education group. Health professional were more likely to get distressed. Respondents with post-secondary education had higher odds (OR = 3.32; p = 0.020) of developing distress as compared to respondents with secondary education or lower. CONCLUSION: There is lower rate of psychological distress in city dwellers and people with low education. Adequate intervention and evaluation into mental health awareness, and psychosocial support focused primarily on health care workers, female and elderly individuals is necessary.","Shrestha, Dhan Bahadur; Thapa, Bikash Bikram; Katuwal, Nagendra; Shrestha, Bikal; Pant, Chiranjibi; Basnet, Bina; Mandal, Pankaj; Gurung, Amol; Agrawal, Ankita; Rouniyar, Ramhari",BMC Psychiatry,,247

Objective: To evaluate the immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) in humans, including the kinetics, magnitude, and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Design, Setting, and Participants: Twenty-five participants were enrolled from July 29, 2020, to August 7, 2020, and the follow-up for this day 71 interim analysis was completed on October 3, 2020; follow-up to assess durability will continue for 2 years. This study was conducted at a single clinical site in Boston, Massachusetts, as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial of Ad26.COV2.S. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive 1 or 2 intramuscular injections with 5 × 1010 viral particles or 1 × 1011 viral particles of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine or placebo administered on day 1 and day 57 (5 participants in each group). Main Outcomes and Measures: Humoral immune responses included binding and neutralizing antibody responses at multiple time points following immunization. Cellular immune responses included immunospot-based and intracellular cytokine staining assays to measure T-cell responses. Results: Twenty-five participants were randomized (median age, 42; age range, 22-52; 52% women, 44% male, 4% undifferentiated), and all completed the trial through the day 71 interim end point. Binding and neutralizing antibodies emerged rapidly by day 8 after initial immunization in 90% and 25% of vaccine recipients, respectively. By day 57, binding and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 100% of vaccine recipients after a single immunization. On day 71, the geometric mean titers of spike-specific binding antibodies were 2432 to 5729 and the geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies were 242 to 449 in the vaccinated groups. A variety of antibody subclasses, Fc receptor binding properties, and antiviral functions were induced. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were induced. Conclusion and Relevance: In this phase 1 study, a single immunization with Ad26.COV2.S induced rapid binding and neutralization antibody responses as well as cellular immune responses.

Lung cancer patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 enters into the host by the ACE2 receptor. Thus, ACE2 is the key to understand the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the lack of knowledge about the biomarker of COVID-19 warrants the development of ACE2 biomarkers. The analysis of ACE2 expression in lung cancer was performed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Therefore, we investigated the prognosis, clinical characteristics, and mutational analysis of lung cancer. We also analyzed the shared proteins between the COVID-19 and lung cancer, protein-protein interactions, gene-miRNAs, gene-transcription factors (TFs), and the signaling pathway. Finally, we compared the mRNA expression of ACE2 and its co-expressed proteins using the TCGA. The up-regulation of ACE2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) was found irrespective of gender and age. We found the low survival rate in high expression of ACE2 in lung cancer patients and 16 mutational positions. The functional assessment of targeted 12,671, 3107, and 29 positive genes were found in COVID-19 disease, LUAD, and LUSC, respectively. Then, we identified eight common genes that interact with 20 genes, 219 miRNAs, and 16 TFs. The common genes performed the mRNA expression in lung cancer, which proved the ACE2 is the best potential biomarker compared to co-expressed genes. This study uncovers the relationship between COVID-19 disease and lung cancer. We identified ACE2 and also its co-expressed proteins are the potential biomarker and therapy as the current COVID-19 disease and lung cancer.","Samad, Abdus; Jafar, Tamanna; Rafi, Jahirul Hasnat",Genomics,,247
248534,Pearls & Oy-sters: Facial nerve palsy in COVID-19 infection,2020,"SARS-COV-2 is a novel coronavirus discovered in Wuhan in December 30, 2019, and is a family of SARS-COV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), that is, coronavirus family. After infection with SARS-COV-2, patients often experience fever, cough, gas prostration, dyspnea and other symptoms, which can lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), kidney failure and even death. The SARS-COV-2 virus is particularly infectious and has led to a global infection crisis, with an explosion in the number of infections. Therefore, rapid and accurate detection of the virus plays a vital role. At present, many detection methods are limited in their wide application due to their defects such as high preparation cost, poor stability and complex operation process. Moreover, some methods need to be operated by professional medical staff, which can easily lead to infection. In order to overcome these problems, a Surface molecular imprinting technology (SM-MIT) is proposed for the first time to detect SARS-COV-2 virus. For this SM-MIT method, this review provides detailed detection principles and steps.

Therefore, we think SM-MIT may have great potential in the detection of SARS-COV-2 virus.","Bu, Jiaqi; Deng, Zhiwei; Liu, Hui; Li, Jiacheng; Wang, De; Yang, Yanjing; Zhong, Shian",Talanta,,247
248762,Increased odds ratio for COVID-19 in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis,2020,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to show how different business model innovations (BMIs) help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the food and beverage industry to navigate turbulent and uncertain environments such as the coronavirus economic crisis (COVID-19) Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts an in-depth case study approach and uses a dynamic business modeling (DBM) approach to analyze how a pioneer craft brewery in Switzerland implemented innovative actions undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic Findings: The paper offers a novel framework describing three processes helping SMEs to implement innovations in their business model (BM) to respond in an effective way to crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic The first process refers to SMEs' ability to leverage readily available resources and allows SMEs to rapidly use their current knowledge to react to the changing environment amid the crisis The second process points at SMEs' ability to transform existing resources into novel products or solutions Finally, by mobilizing distant resources from their network, SMEs can obtain new resources and knowledge that facilitate the implementation of major changes in their BM Originality/value: Unlike previous studies, this research adopts a cause-and-effect perspective to make explicit how SMEs' BM changes affect strategic resources, key drivers and processes, thereby impacting performance The analysis of the multiple reinforcing and balancing feedback loops resulting from the DBM approach can help SME entrepreneurs learn how and what changes are required in their BM to effectively face turbulent times, such as the COVID-19 crisis From such an analysis, it emerged that the ability of SMEs to effectively implement innovations amid a crisis depends in large part on their collaborations with business partners and their ability to use and transform internal and external knowledge In addition, as the future evolution of the COVID-19 crisis is still ongoing and uncertain, this study offers a unique perspective for SMEs in the food and beverage industry as the situation unfolds rather than after the fact © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","Bivona, E.; Cruz, M.",British Food Journal,,247

However, the mechanism of tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Here, recombinant receptor-binding subdomain 1 of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (RBD-SD1) was used as a probe to investigate the potential tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in thirty-three types of normal human tissues. RBD-SD1 probe was observed to interact with cells in reported SARS-CoV-2 infected organs. Interestingly, the RBD-SD1 probe strongly interacted with bone marrow cells in an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-independent manner. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 induced the ACE2 mRNA expression in human primary bone marrow cells, suggesting human bone marrow cells may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, human bone marrow cells could be strongly infected by SARS-CoV-2, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. These findings provide a deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection routes, thus contributing to the treatment of COVID-19.","Zheng, B.; Yuan, M.; Ma, Q.; Wang, S.; Tan, Y.; Xu, Y.; Ye, J.; Gao, Y.; Sun, X.; Yang, Z.; Xu, P.; Kong, L.; Wu, X.; Xu, Q.",International Immunopharmacology,,247

Though there is a big research gap in the pan - Indian context on the correlations of happiness with some important parameters, namely gender, marital status, age, education, and income, this study tried to fill this gap. The findings showed that income levels, marital status, education, and age group – all were positively related to happiness. Practitioners, namely, policymakers and corporate executives, need to consider these significant insights to understand people and what makes them happy. Instead of working on guesswork on what makes people happy, these insights on correlations of happiness are a good starting point for understanding people. Researchers and academicians can use these new findings in the Indian context as inputs in their research, teaching, and consultancy. One limitation of the study is that it explained the correlations of happiness.

This exploratory study is part of a larger mixed methods survey project, reporting the qualitative data from an on-line survey of clinical staff working at one acute hospital between April 16th and May 13th, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses to five free-text questions were analysed using inductive content analysis. 321 medical, nursing, allied health and non-clinical staff responded to the survey. Respondents reported anxiety, fear and uncertainty related to the pandemic, from the perspectives of work, home, family and community. They reported feeling confused by inconsistent messages received from government, hospital executive, managers and media. Seven themes were identified: (i) worrying about patient care, (ii) changed working conditions, (iii) working in the changed hospital environment, (iv) impact of the pandemic, (v) personal isolation and uncertainty, (vi) leadership and management and (vii) additional support needed for staff. Despite the pandemic being comparatively well-controlled in Australia, all disciplines reported a high degree of anticipatory anxiety. Staff working in healthcare require both managerial and psychological support to minimise anxiety and promote well-being and resilience in order to deal with the health crisis.

The question raised is whether a therapeutic system as peaceful, mild, and non-violent as homeopathy can survive and grow within a society that often displays the opposite characteristics.Much of contemporary society is more interested in fast and impressive cures, even if these may also bring side effects; whereas homeopathy can offer solutions with a personalized approach that requires long hours of case study by the homeopath to find the correct personal remedy that aims to bring about positive results, which the therapy can produce in deep chronic diseases.The conclusion drawn is that homeopathy does not readily fit within a modern and violent society that prefers quick and invasive solutions to its clinical problems.","Vithoulkas, George",Homeopathy,,247

To estimate the impact of K-12 closures and reopening policies on children's social interactions and COVID-19 incidence in California's Bay Area, we collected data on children's social contacts and assessed implications for transmission using an individual-based model. Elementary and Hispanic children had more contacts during closures than high school and non-Hispanic children, respectively. We estimated that spring 2020 closures of elementary schools averted 2167 cases in the Bay Area (95% CI: -985, 5572), fewer than middle (5884; 95% CI: 1478, 11.550), high school (8650; 95% CI: 3054, 15 940) and workplace (15 813; 95% CI: 9963, 22 617) closures.

METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted to a COVID-19 isolation and treatment centre were included in this study. The overall clinical spectrum of COVID-19, and factors associated with risk of severe COVID-19 and in-hospital mortality were analysed. RESULTS: Of 2617 quarantined patients, three-quarters (n = 1935, 74%) were asymptomatic and only 114 (4.4%) presented with severe COVID-19. Common characteristics among the 682 symptomatic patients were cough (n = 354, 50.6%), myalgia (n = 212, 31.1%), headache (n = 196, 28.7%), fever (n = 161, 23.6%), dyspnoea (n = 111, 16.3%), anosmia and/or dysgeusia (n = 90, 13.2%), sore throat (n = 87, 12.8%) and chest pain (n = 77, 11.3%). Factors associated with severe COVID-19 were older age [adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61-1.97; P < 0.0001], diabetes (aRR 2.00, 95% CI 1.20-3.32; P = 0.007), cardiovascular disease (aRR 2.53, 95% CI 1.53-4.17; P < 0.0001), malignancy (aRR 4.57, 95% CI 1.62-12.87; P = 0.004), surgery/trauma (aRR 23.98, 95% CI 10.35-55.57; P < 0.0001) and human immunodeficiency virus infection (aRR 4.24, 95% CI 1.55-11.61; P = 005). Factors associated with risk of in-hospital mortality included older age (aRR 2.37, 95% CI 1.90-2.95; P < 0.001), malignancy (aRR 6.73, 95% CI 1.50-30.16; P = 0.013) and surgery/trauma (aRR 59.52, 95% CI 12.90-274.68; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of cases of COVID-19 were asymptomatic, and key comorbid conditions increased the risk of severe COVID-19 and in-hospital mortality.

257116,The COVID-19 & Cancer Consortium (CCC19) and Opportunities for Radiation Oncology,2020,"The novel Coronavirus also called Covid-19 originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now spread across the world. It has so far infected around 1.8 million people and claimed approximately 114698 lives overall. As the number of cases are rapidly increasing, most of the countries are facing shortage of testing kits and resources. The limited quantity of testing kits and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep Learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting Covid-19 cases using chest X-rays. Therefore, in this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to automatically detect Covid-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The deep model called CoroNet has been trained and tested on a dataset prepared by collecting Covid-19 and other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available databases. The experimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 89.5%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for Covid-19 cases are 97% and 100%. The preliminary results of this study look promising which can be further improved as more training data becomes available. Overall, the proposed model substantially advances the current radiology based methodology and during Covid-19 pandemic, it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid them in diagnosis, quantification and follow-up of Covid-19 cases.","Khan, Asif Iqbal; Shah, Junaid Latief; Bhat, Mudasir",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04931v2.pdf,247
257580,A Comprehensive Review of COVID-19 Associated Neurological Manifestations,2020,"In a prospective study, we sought to determine acceptability of linkage of administrative and clinical trial data among Canadian patients and Research Ethics Boards (REBs). The goal is to develop a more harmonized approach to data, with potential to improve clinical trial conduct through enhanced data quality collected at reduced cost and inconvenience for patients. On completion of the original LY.12 randomized clinical trial in lymphoma (NCT00078949), participants were invited to enrol in the Long-term Innovative Follow-up Extension (LIFE) component. Those consenting to do so provided comprehensive identifying information to facilitate linkage with their administrative data. We prospectively designed a global assessment of this innovative approach to clinical trial follow-up including rates of REB approval and patient consent. The pre-specified benchmark for patient acceptability was 80%. Of 16 REBs who reviewed the research protocol, 14 (89%) provided approval; two in Quebec declined due to small patient numbers. Of 140 patients invited to participate, 115 (82%, 95% CI 76 to 88%) from across 9 Canadian provinces provided consent and their full name, date of birth, health insurance number and postal code to facilitate linkage with their administrative data for long-term follow-up. Linkage of clinical trial and administrative data is feasible and acceptable. Further collaborative work including many stakeholders is required to develop an optimized secure approach to research. A more coordinated national approach to health data could facilitate more rapid testing and identification of new effective treatments across multiple jurisdictions and diseases from diabetes to COVID-19.","Hay, Annette E; Mittmann, Nicole; Crump, Michael; Cheung, Matthew C; Sleeth, Jessica; Needham, Judy; Broekhoven, Mike; Djurfeldt, Marina; Shepherd, Lois E; Meyer, Ralph M; Chen, Bingshu E; Pater, Joseph L",Curr Oncol,,247

The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in infants remain unknown. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 have adverse brain development. METHODS: This multicenter observational study was conducted at two designated maternal and children's hospitals in Hubei Province, mainland China from February 1, 2020 to May 15, 2020. Neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 were enrolled. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and volumes of grey and white matters, and physical growth parameters were observed at 44 weeks corrected gestational age. RESULTS: Of 72 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19, 8 (11%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, 8 (11%) were critically ill, and no deaths were reported. Among the eight neonates that underwent brain MRI at corrected gestational age of 44 weeks, five neonates were diagnosed with COVID-19. Among these five neonates, three presented abnormal MRI findings including abnormal signal in white matter and delayed myelination in newborn 2, delayed myelination and brain dysplasia in newborn 3, and abnormal signal in the bilateral periventricular in newborn 5. The other three neonates without COVID-19 presented no significantly changes of brain MRI findings and the volumes of grey matter and white matter compared to those of healthy newborns at the equivalent age (P > 0.05). Physical growth parameters for weight, length, and head circumference at gestational age of 44 weeks were all above the 3rd percentile for all neonates. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 had abnormal brain MRI findings but these neonates did not appear to have poor physical growth. These findings may provide the information on the follow-up schedule on the neonates exposed to SARS-CoV-2, but further study is required to evaluate the association between the abnormal MRI findings and the exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Zeng, Ling-Kong; Zhu, Hua-Ping; Xiao, Tian-Tian; Peng, Si-Cong; Yuan, Wen-Hao; Shao, Jian-Bo; Wang, Lai-Shuan; Xiao, Fei-Fan; Xia, Shi-Wen; Lee, Shoo K; Yan, Kai; Zhou, Wen-Hao",World J Pediatr,,247

DESIGN: We followed the Cochrane criteria and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for this systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Cochrane COVID-19 registry, CINAHL and pre-print services (medR&#967;iv and PsyArXiv) were searched from January 1 to November 15, 2020 and we removed duplicates. REVIEW METHODS: We applied a random effect model to estimate pooled effects since the heterogeneity between results was very high. RESULTS: Sixteen studies, including 18,935 nurses met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of emotional exhaustion was 34.1%, of depersonalization was 12.6% and of lack of personal accomplishment was 15.2%. The main risk factors that increased nurses' burnout were the following: younger age, decreased social support, low family and colleagues readiness to cope with COVID-19 outbreak, increased perceived threat of Covid-19, longer working time in quarantine areas, working in a high-risk environment, working in hospitals with inadequate and insufficient material and human resources, increased workload and lower level of specialized training regarding COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Nurses experience high levels of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic, while several sociodemographic, social and occupational factors affect this burnout. IMPACT: We found that burnout among nurses is a crucial issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to prepare nurses to cope better with COVID-19 pandemic. Identification of risk factors for burnout could be a significant weapon giving nurses and health care systems the ability to response in a better way against the following COVID-19 waves in the near future.","Galanis, Petros; Vraka, Irene; Fragkou, Despoina; Bilali, Angeliki; Kaitelidou, Daphne",J Adv Nurs,,247

But the information about cardiac consequences of COVID-19 after recovery is limited. The aim of the study was comprehensive echocardiography assessment of right ventricular (RV) in patients recovered from COVID-19. This is a prospective, single-center study. After recovery from COVID-19, echocardiography was performed in consecutive 79 patients that attended follow-up visits from July 15 to November 30, 2020. According to the recovery at home vs hospital, patients were divided into two groups: home recovery (n = 43) and hospital recovery (n = 36). Comparisons were made with age, sex and risk factor-matched control group (n = 41). In addition to conventional echocardiography parameters, RV global longitudinal strain (RV-GLS) and RV free wall strain (RV-FWS) were determined using 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D STE). Of the 79 patients recovered from COVID-19, 43 (55%) recovered at home, while 36 (45%) required hospitalization. The median follow-up duration was 133 ± 35 (87-184) days. In patients recovered from hospital, RV-GLS and RV-FWS were impaired compared to control group (RV-GLS: -17.3 ± 6.8 vs. -20.4 ± 4.9, respectively [p = 0.042]; RV-FWS: -19.0 ± 8.2 vs. -23.4 ± 6.2, respectively [p = 0.022]). In subgroup analysis, RV-FWS was impaired in patients severe pneumonia (n = 11) compared to mild-moderate pneumonia (n = 28), without pneumonia (n = 40) and control groups (-15.8 ± 7.6 vs. -21.6 ± 7.6 vs. -20.8 ± 7.7 vs. -23.4 ± 6.2, respectively, [p = 0.001 for each]) and RV-GLS was impaired compared to control group (-15.2 ± 6.9 vs. -20.4 ± 4; respectively, [p = 0.013]). A significant correlation was detected between serum CRP level at hospital admission and both RV-GLS and RV-FWS (r = 0.285, p = 0.006; r = 0.294, p = 0.004, respectively). Age (OR 0.948, p = 0.010), male gender (OR 0.289, p = 0.009), pneumonia on CT (OR 0.019, p = 0.004), and need of steroid in treatment (OR 17.424, p = 0.038) were identifed as independent predictors of impaired RV-FWS (> -18) via multivariate analysis. We demonstrated subclinic dysfunction of RV by 2D-STE in hospitalized patients in relation to the severity of pneumonia after recovery from COVID-19. 2D-STE supplies additional information above standard measures of RV in this cohort and can be used in the follow-up of these patients.","Ozer, Pelin Karaca; Govdeli, Elif Ayduk; Baykiz, Derya; Karaayvaz, Ekrem Bilal; Medetalibeyoglu, Alpay; Catma, Yunus; Elitok, Ali; Cagatay, Atahan; Umman, Berrin; Oncul, Aytac; Tukek, Tufan; Bugra, Zehra",Int J Cardiovasc Imaging,,247
259518,Sex differences in mortality among patients with COVID-19 related stroke,2021,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the Brazilian healthcare system, resulting in deferral of elective cardiac procedures and avoidance of medical care due to social distancing. We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on hospital admissions and death rates associated with coronary events in a Brazilian large-scale private health system. Methods From March 18 - Sep 30, 2020 we evaluated the administrative database of UNIMED-BH, a cooperative Brazilian private insurance, with over 1.25 million clients from a large urban center. We collected data from admissions in all owned and accredited hospitals related to urgent and elective coronary events (acute coronary syndromes, coronary interventions, clinical management of coronary artery disease and invasive diagnostic procedures). Admissions in 2020 were compared to the 2-year historical series (2018, 2019), and rates/100,000 were calculated considering the mean covered population. Outcomes were assessed until October 15th, 15 days after the last enrollment. Results In the 196-day period, the number of coronary admissions in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were, respectively, 2,789, 3,519 and 2,348, and patients had a median age of 67 [58-76] years, being 59% men. The mean length of hospital stay was 6.7±9.3 days, and 27% had &gt;1 admission in 3 years. The adjusted rates of admissions were 221, 278 and 184/100,000 clients, resulting in a significant 26% (95% CI 22 - 30) reduction in 2020 compared to the historical series (p&lt;0.001). The reduction was more pronounced from March to May (36%) - when social isolation started - compared to the peak of the pandemic (June to September, 19%). In-hospital mortality was also significantly higher in 2020 (5.4%, 95% CI 4.5 - 6.4) compared to 2018/2019 (3.6%, 95% CI 3.2 - 4.1), p&lt;0.001, despite the similar age (67 [57-76) vs. 67 [58-76], p=0.15) and length of hospital stay (6.9±8.9 vs. 6.7±9.5 days, p=0.43). Conclusion There was a significant decrease in admissions due to coronary events during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, in parallel with increased in-hospital mortality. Deferral of elective procedures and avoidance of medical care possibly resulted in delayed presentation and unfavorable outcomes.","Nascimento, B. R.; Fróes, L. E. V.; Castro, A. C. T.; Fróes, E.

With the remarkable ability of GANs in learning the distribution and generating images of a particular class, they can be used for semi-supervised classification tasks. However, the problem is that if two classes of images share similar characteristics, the GAN might learn to generalize and hinder the classification of the two classes. In this paper, we use various images from MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets to illustrate how similar images cause the GAN to generalize, leading to the poor classification of images. We propose a modification to the traditional training of GANs that allows for improved multi-class classification in similar classes of images in a semi-supervised learning framework.","Motamed, Saman; Khalvati, Farzad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06944v2.pdf,247

For this reason, it is necessary to check compatibility data of the glove with the disinfectant product in glove disinfection. AIM: To test the resistance of nitrile gloves to different disinfectant solutions. METHODS: To analyze the resistance of nitrile gloves, firstly, the gloves were exposed to the disinfectant. The exposure to the disinfectant was analyzed comparing the control group (untreated glove) with the others. For the tensile test, the thickness of each test specimen was measured with a micrometer .100% powder-free nitrile gloves, composed of nitrile Butadiene rubber (NBR) compounds, were used. The 7 most commonly used disinfectant solutions in the healthcare field were selected. FINDINGS: A bleach solution did decrease breaking load, although to a lesser extent than disinfectants that contain ethanol in their composition. CONCLUSION: With the methods used, we have determined the influence that various disinfectants have on nitrile gloves, finding that those which contain alcohol cause a decrease in breaking load.","Garrido-Molina, José Miguel; Márquez-Hernández, Verónica V; Alcayde-García, Alfredo; Ferreras-Morales, Carlos Alberto; García-Viola, Alba; Aguilera-Manrique, Gabriel; Gutiérrez-Puertas, Lorena",J. hosp. infect,,247

Despite the potentially beneficial effects of colchicine, there is no consensus on the appropriate dosage regimen and numerous schemes are currently used.In this study, simulations were performed to identify the ability of dosage regimens to attain plasma levels in CVOID-19 patients, known to be generally safe and efficacious. Since renal and hepatic impairment, as well as, drug-drug interactions have been identified to be the most significant factors increasing colchicine toxicity, the impact of these interactions was assessed in the simulations.Some dosage regimens lead to high colchicine concentrations, while others result in sub-therapeutic levels. Additional dosage schemes were proposed in this study aiming to be applied in patients with clearance insufficiency. Colchicine administration of 0.5 mg twice daily, can be considered safe and effective. In cases of clearance impairment, doses as low as 0.25 mg thrice or twice daily should be applied.Colchicine is a narrow therapeutic index drug and dosage regimens tailored to patients' needs should be designed.","Karatza, Eleni; Ismailos, George; Karalis, Vangelis",Xenobiotica,,247

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed, verified, and deployed a stacked generalization model to predict mortality using data available in the EHR by combining five previously validated scores and additional novel variables reported to be associated with COVID-19-specific mortality. We verified the model with prospectively collected data from 12 hospitals in Colorado between March 2020 and July 2020. We compared the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) for the new model to the SOFA score and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: The prospective cohort included 27,296 encounters, of which 1,358 (5.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 4,494 (16.5%) required intensive care unit care, 1,480 (5.4%) required mechanical ventilation, and 717 (2.6%) ended in death. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and SOFA scores predicted mortality with an AUROC of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively. Our novel score predicted mortality with AUROC 0.94. In the subset of patients with COVID-19, the stacked model predicted mortality with AUROC 0.90, whereas SOFA had AUROC of 0.85. DISCUSSION: Stacked regression allows a flexible, updatable, live-implementable, ethically defensible predictive analytics tool for decision support that begins with validated models and includes only novel information that improves prediction. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated an accurate in-hospital mortality prediction score in a live EHR for automatic and continuous calculation using a novel model that improved upon SOFA.","Sottile, Peter D; Albers, David; DeWitt, Peter E; Russell, Seth; Stroh, J N; Kao, David P; Adrian, Bonnie; Levine, Matthew E; Mooney, Ryan; Larchick, Lenny; Kutner, Jean S; Wynia, Matthew K; Glasheen, Jeffrey J; Bennett, Tellen D",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,247

Genetic diversification of the Corona virus has resulted in strains that cause severe respiratory tract infections in humans via drip and animal mediation. S-proteins covering its surface, which bind to the cell receptor - angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are important in shaping virus activity. The course of infection varies from mild to severe. The ability to control infection is limited because there are no drugs that fully inhibit 2019-nCoV. Interferon-alpha (5 million U twice daily by inhalation), lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily orally), as well as chloroquine (500 mg twice daily orally for 10 days) and azithromycin (500 mg twice per day) cause a milder course of the disease and reduce the duration of treatment. The administration of glucocorticosteroids and research drugs (tocilizumab) is acceptable for massive infiltrative lesions in the pulmonary parenchyma causing severe lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the system operation it is necessary to create the socalled a safety matrix that would take into account the existing threat on the one hand and all available services and resources on the other.

While the COVID-19 illness is largely associated with respiratory consequences, there is increased reporting of other organ-specific disease sequelae that include the skin. OBJECTIVE: To identify, describe, and classify the main skin manifestations of COVID-19 and associated protocols for management. METHODS: Forty-five patients from three clinical centers in North and South America with positive COVID-19 PCR and/or serology presenting cutaneous manifestations were included in this retrospective chart review. Medical history, biopsies, dermoscopy, laboratory findings, clinical photography, and disease management were documented. RESULTS: Seven main types of cutaneous manifestations were identified: exanthema/molbilliform, urticaria, papular/pustular/vesicular, petechiae/purpura, livedo reticularis, chilblains, and alopecia. Histopathogical analysis from skin biopsies and/or dermoscopy highlighted an inflammatory or vascular pathophysiology depending on the type of manifestation. While the first three types of COVID-19 skin manifestations preceded or coincided with other symptoms such as anosmia, fever, chills, chilblains, and livedo were found in later disease stages. All cases had a positive resolution with appropriate treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous symptoms are part of the COVID-19 disease spectrum. Early identification, diagnosis, and management through a multidisciplinary approach can facilitate safe disease resolution for patients.

Measuring temporal variation in the all-cause mortality sex ratio before and during the pandemic in populations exposed to different constraints on risky behavior would allow us to better anticipate changes in the ratio and to better understand its association with infection control strategies. METHODS: I apply time Box-Jenkins modeling to 262 months of pre-pandemic mortality sex ratios to arrive at counterfactual values of 10 intra-pandemic ratios. I compare counterfactual to observed values to determine if intra-pandemic ratios differed detectably from those expected as well as whether the Norwegian and Swedish differences varied from each other. RESULTS: The male to female mortality sex ratio in both Norway and Sweden increased during the pandemic. I, however, find no evidence that the increase differed between the two countries despite their different COVID-19 containment strategies. CONCLUSION: Societal expectations of who will die during the COVID-19 pandemic will likely be wrong if they assume pre-pandemic mortality sex ratios because the intra-pandemic ratios appear, at least in Norway and Sweden, detectably higher. The contribution of differences in policies to reduce risky behavior to those higher ratios appears, however, small.","Catalano, Ralph",Scand J Public Health,,247

This paper proposes a methodology to study vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Curitiba, one of the main Brazilian metropolises. The proposed methodology encompasses three different strategies, in a mixed-methods approach: i. In-depth telephone interviews with vulnerable people and community leaders who work with them; ii. Online surveys with the city’s general population; iii. Focus groups coupled with alternative scenarios methods involving key actors in the community life of the city. In addition to the research findings themselves, our methodology also envisages fostering initiatives by public authorities and civil society to mitigate the effects of the pandemic over vulnerable populations.","Silva, Diego R. de Moraes; Mont’alverne, Camila",Surv.

A cross-sectional and representative study was conducted with 899 public high school adolescents from São José dos Pinhais, Paraná, Brazil. It involved measurement of physical activity levels and screen time and classification according to the norms of the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The factors associated with insufficient physical activity levels and high screen time were gender, sexual maturation, social support and self-efficacy in terms of physical activity. Poisson regression was applied to test the associations. Population attributable fraction (PAF) and relative risk reduction (RRR) calculated the impact of associated factors with insufficient physical activity levels and high screen time among adolescents. In the combined presence of insufficient physical activity levels with high screen time, the female sex presented PAF = 13.04, a post-pubertal stage PAF = 9.91 and social support presented RRR = 31.00. The findings suggest that being female and post-pubescent are risk factors, while social support is a protective factor, for combined insufficient physical activity levels and high screen time among adolescents.","Piola, Thiago Silva; Bacil, Eliane Denise Araújo; Pacífico, Ana Beatriz; Camargo, Edina Maria de; Campos, Wagner de",Cien Saude Colet,,247
273912,Providing Person-Centered Care via Telemedicine in the Era of COVID-19 in Multiple Sclerosis,2021,"This paper fires the opening salvo in the systematic construction of the lattice-continuum correspondence, a precise dictionary that describes the emergence of continuum quantum theories from finite, nonperturbatively defined models (""lattice theories""). Here the focus will be on quantum field theory in (0+1)D, i.e. quantum mechanics. The main conceptual achievement is an explicit and systematic procedure for reducing a theory with a large but finite Hilbert space to a subtheory in which wavefunctions satisfy prescribed smoothness and compactness constraints. This reduction, here named taming, in effect defines quantum mechanics on a continuum target space. When appropriate lattice theories are tamed, many familiar continuum notions explicitly emerge, e.g. canonical commutation relations, contact terms in correlation functions, continuous spacetime symmetries, and supersymmetry algebras. All of these are thus""put on the lattice""using the present framework. This analysis also leads to further insights into old subjects: for example, it is proven that any supersymmetric lattice theory must have a vanishing Witten index.","Radicevic, Djordje",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11470v2.pdf,247

The New York Proton Center (NYPC), a large freestanding clinic in New York City, New York, presents a 1-month experience of employee-reported health outcomes after the infiltration of COVID-19 and enforcement of policies designed to mitigate its impact. Materials and Methods: In March 2020, new operational policies were implemented, including rigorous and frequent sanitation, visitor and treatment restrictions, distribution of personal protective equipment, work-from-home orders, and isolated nursing and radiation therapy teams. Employees of NYPC were prospectively monitored for exposure and symptoms of COVID-19. Work hours lost because of illness or quarantines were quantified from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2020. Results: Among 95 total employees, 23 (24%) were quarantined because of symptoms (n = 15; 65%), high-risk exposure (n = 5; 22%), or self-quarantined with personal concern (n = 3; 13%). Of 44 full-time, on-site employees, 39% (n = 17, including 6 therapists and 5 nurses) missed significant work time, including 6 (14%) with confirmed COVID-19. At full capacity, NYPC would have used 7260 work hours during March 2020 from the full-time, on-site staff, which was reduced by 18.8% overall (25.2% of nursing and 13.3% of therapy work hours), all in the latter half of the month. Among the therapist lost work hours, 92% were from 2 of 7 distinct, isolated therapy teams (29%). Without isolation, the exposure was modeled to have been 100%. Conclusion: Despite losing significant staff hours in our department because of COVID-19, early and aggressive adoption of current, recommended policy guidelines outlined in this manuscript allowed NYPC to continue patient operations at full capacity.","Hasan, Shaakir; Press, Robert H; Chhabra, Arpit; Choi, J Isabelle; Simone, Charles B",Int J Part Ther,,247

On January 30, 2020 the first case of COVID-19 pandemic in India was reported. The spread escalated in the month of March and April in India. This paper deals with traditional infectious disease prediction models predicting the bed occupancy rate for few states in India. The correlation for recovered and deceased with confirmed cases were found and a relation is obtained by using linear and quadratic regression equation. Based on the results obtained probabilistic model is predicted for number of bed occupancy for a specific time period. The three distributions that are used with the probabilistic models are Poisson distribution, weighted Poisson distribution and Geometric Poisson distribution. The data has been taken from website for the month of March and April and were tested for fitting of proposed distributions using goodness of fit. Graph of deceased, recovered, and confirmed COVID cases for a particular time period is shown. The study is considered to be preliminary as there is only comparison of the distributions based on bed occupancy and the probability of occurrence. But this method can be extended for more months and for various distributions for better future predictions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Ashok, A.; Gopika, P.

This case highlighted the importance of close coordination between Chinese medicine and western medicine in the diagnosis and treatment, as well as the need for rapid dissemination of clinical information related to patient care with this emerging infection. We reported a COVID-19 case confirmed in China and described the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case. The patient had initial mild symptoms at presentation; it progressed to severe pneumonia on the 10th day of onset. This cured case supplied a time series analysis of tongue characteristics found in severe COVID-19. Chinese medicine formulae were tweaked by tongue characteristics, which include tongue color, fur thickness, and fur color. Tongue images were obtained every two days, and the changes were firmly related to the progression of COVID-19. These tongue characteristics could be used as effective, non-intrusive indices for the distinct stages of COVID-19 stages. Our study was the first time tongue diagnosis was applied in time series analysis of the progression of COVID-19 disease. We found that tongue color, fur thickness, and fur color were closely related to the progression of COVID-19 by analyzing various tongue images obtained regularly. Based on this success, we will further apply tongue diagnosis to tongue characteristics of COVID-19 patients to help limit the risk of COVID-19.","Liang, Keji; Huang, Xiaodan; Chen, Hua; Qiu, Liling; Zhuang, Yanshan; Zou, Chuan; Bai, Yunpeng; Huang, Yisheng",Ann Palliat Med,,247

Whether the immune response to T&#945;1 treatment for SARS-CoV-2 differs between the sexes, and whether this difference explains the male susceptibility to COVID-19, is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the efficiency and safety of T&#945;1 treatment and provide a basis for practically identifying gender differences characteristics and features of COVID-19. One hundred twenty-seven patients had COVID-19 symptoms and tested COVID19-positive (female 42.52%) in Wuhan union hospital were enrolled for medication. They were randomly divided into groups Control and T&#945;1 intervention. Seventy-eight patients received a subcutaneous injection of 1.6 mg T&#945;1, based on supportive treatment for 15 days. The control group included untreated 49 COVID19 patients closely matched for gender and age and received regular supportive treatment. In this retrospective analysis, we found that COVID-19-infected males reported more symptoms than COVID-19-infected females. A high degree of gender differences-related variability was observed in CRP and PCT levels and the cell counts of many lymphocyte subpopulations in the COVID-19 patients after T&#945;1 intervention. Levels of CRP and IL-6 were higher in T&#945;1-treated male group than T&#945;1-treated female group, while the level of PCT was significantly lower in T&#945;1-treated male group. Gender differences may be a factor in sustaining COVID-19 immunity responded to T&#945;1, male and female show statistically significant differences in relevance to cytokine production associated with the development of a more significant number of symptoms. This leaves the question of identifying gender-specific risk factors to explain these differences.","Li, Xin; Liu, Lancong; Yang, Yi; Yang, Xuefeng; Wang, Cencen; Li, Yan; Ge, Yanyan; Shi, Yuxin; Lv, Ping; Zhou, Hua; Luo, Pei; Huang, Shilong",Int Immunopharmacol,,247

This article uses securitization theory to analyze the government's measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic and discusses how the government's increasing reliance on military figures and national security agencies influences the measures used to control the COVID-19 pandemic. This study finds that initially, the government seemed to be trying to de-securitize the issue, denying warnings that the virus might have existed undetected in Indonesia. Then, after the first cases were confirmed in March 2020, the government responded by securitizing the issue. The delay in the government's response to COVID-19 caused the audience to not fully accept the government's securitization efforts because public trust in the government's measures was already low, while the means of emergency action taken by the government against the threat of COVID-19 are also limited. The government has also been overly reliant on influential military figures and national security agencies. The government also tended to downgrade the threats, lack transparency, and even use the pandemic to crack down on anti-government smears. This article concludes that the government needs to change their approach to COVID-19 measures and prioritize the human security dimension by not downgrading the threats and upholding transparency. © 2021 Jurnal Ilmu Sosial dan Ilmu Politik.

277024,Erythema multiforme in a COVID-19 positive patient,2020,"COVID-19 emerged from China in December 2019 and during 2020 spread to every continent including Antarctica. The coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been identified as the causative pathogen, and its spread has stretched the capacities of healthcare systems and negatively affected the global economy. This review provides an update on the virus, including the genome, the risks associated with the emergence of variants, mode of transmission, immune response, COVID-19 in children and the elderly, and advances made to contain, prevent and manage the disease. Although our knowledge of the mechanics of virus transmission and the immune response has been substantially demystified, concerns over reinfection, susceptibility of the elderly and whether asymptomatic children promote transmission remain unanswered. There are also uncertainties about the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and why there are variations in clinical presentations and why some patients suffer from long lasting symptoms-""the long haulers."" To date, there are no significantly effective curative drugs for COVID-19, especially after failure of hydroxychloroquine trials to produce positive results. The RNA polymerase inhibitor, remdesivir, facilitates recovery of severely infected cases but, unlike the anti-inflammatory drug, dexamethasone, does not reduce mortality. However, vaccine development witnessed substantial progress with several being approved in countries around the globe.","Triggle, Chris R; Bansal, Devendra; Ding, Hong; Islam, Md Mazharul; Farag, Elmoubashar Abu Baker Abd; Hadi, Hamad Abdel; Sultan, Ali A",Front Immunol,,247
277025,Erythema multiforme in a COVID-19 positive patient,2020,"Meteorological conditions may influence the incidence of many infectious diseases. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious, air-borne, emerging, viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic affected more than 210 countries and territories worldwide including Saudi Arabia. There are contradictory research papers about the correlation between meteorological parameters and incidence of COVID-19 in some countries worldwide. The current study investigates the impact of outdoor and indoor meteorological conditions on the daily recorded COVID-19 cases in western region (Makkah and Madinah cities) of Saudi Arabia over a period of 8 months from March to October 2020. Reports of the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from the webpage of Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) were used. Considering, the incubation period of COVID-19 which ranged from 2 to 14 days, the relationships between daily COVID-19 cases and outdoor meteorological factors (temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed) using a lag time of 10 days are investigated. The results showed that the highest daily COVID-19 cases in Makkah and Madinah were reported during the hottest months of the year (April-July 2020) when outdoor temperature ranged from 26.51 to 40.71 °C in Makkah and of 23.89-41.20 °C in Madinah, respectively. Partial negative correlation was detected between outdoor relative humidity and daily recorded COVID-19 cases. No obvious correlation could be demonstrated between wind speed and daily COVID-19 cases. This indicated that most of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in the cool, air-conditioned, dry, and bad-ventilated indoor environment in the investigated cities. These results will help the epidemiologists to understand the correlation between both outdoor and indoor meteorological conditions and SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. These findings would be also a useful supplement to assist the local healthcare policymakers to implement and apply a specific preventive measures and education programs for controlling of COVID-19 transmission.","Habeebullah, Turki M; Abd El-Rahim, Ibrahim H A; Morsy, Essam A",J Environ Manage,,247
277140,Knowledge and Perceptions of the Covid-19 Pandemic among Patients with Myasthenia Gravis,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the article is to stimulate discussions about the necessity to improve the legal regulations that guarantee a proper public health policy, as well as to determine the balance between the level of restrictions that may be imposed by State in order to protect both, the public interest of health and the economic development. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: National legislation of Ukraine, United Kingdom and France on public health and health policy, case law of these countries, including high court decisions were used for dialectical, comparative, synthetic and systemic analyses. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: As the legality of government officials' actions principle is a fundamental constitutional principle in most European countries, states must establish such legal provisions to avoid short-term and long-term conflicts when the rights of individuals and legal entities are being restricted. At the legislative level, it is necessary to adopt transparent rules to attract private funding to the health sector. Development of the e-health and telemedicine systems could be boosted through the use of public-private partnership tools.","Rudnyeva, Oleksandra; Prykhodko, Olena",Wiad Lek,,247

277542,Doing the right thing for the right reason when treating ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in the COVID-19 era,2020,"The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 27 million confirmed cases and 8,90,000 deaths all around the world. Verity of viral infections can infect the nervous system; these viral infections can present a wide range of manifestation. The aim of the current study was to systematically review the COVID-19 associated central nervous system manifestations, mental and neurological symptoms. For that we conducted a comprehensive systematic literature review of four online databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Embase. All relevant articles that reported psychiatric/psychological symptoms or disorders in COVID-19 without considering time and language restrictions were assessed. All the study procedures were performed based on the PRISMA criteria. Due to the screening, 14 studies were included. The current study result indicated that, the pooled prevalence of CNS or mental associated disorders with 95% CI was 50.68% (6.68-93.88). The most prevalence symptoms were hyposmia/anosmia/olfactory dysfunction (number of study: 10) with 36.20% (14.99-60.51). Only one study reported numbness/paresthesia and dysphonia. Pooled prevalence of numbness/paresthesia and dysphonia was 5.83% (2.17-12.25) and 2.39% (10.75-14.22). The pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety was 3.52% (2.62-4.54) and 13.92% (9.44-19.08). Our findings demonstrate that COVID-19 has a certain relation with neurological symptoms. The hypsomia, anosmia or olfactory dysfunction was most frequent symptom. Other symptoms were headache or dizziness, dysgeusia or ageusia, dysphonia and fatigue. Depression, anxiety, and confusion were less frequent symptoms.","Soltani, Saber; Tabibzadeh, Alireza; Zakeri, Armin; Zakeri, Amir Mohammad; Latifi, Tayebeh; Shabani, Mahdi; Pouremamali, Amir; Erfani, Yousef; Pakzad, Iraj; Malekifar, Pooneh; Valizadeh, Reza; Zandi, Milad; Pakzad, Reza",Rev Neurosci,,247
277790,Advance in the studies of the bidirectional effects of COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease,2020,"Leadership is a journey. However, few leaders embark on the type of journey that fosters greatness. That journey is best described as a pilgrimage, a leadership pilgrimage. A pilgrimage is a sacred journey with a purpose, one that requires vision, focus, and perseverance to complete. During the pilgrimage, pilgrims share a common experience: enlightenment through solitude and sacrifice. The Camino de Santiago is such a journey. It is a powerful metaphor for a leadership pilgrimage: a self-reflective journey leading to leadership enlightenment. This paper explores the impact of a virtual pilgrimage on the Way of St. James on leaders as they study five parallels between the Way of St. James and corporate leadership development. The Virtual Leadership Pilgrimage was created during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of this writing, the first group of participants is enrolling. They will provide feedback regarding how transformative the Virtual Pilgrimage has been to their leadership experience. Our goal is to combine leadership development with the experience of walking the Way of St. James. Participants, like pilgrims, should stretch themselves in both body and spirit as they travel on their road to personal enlightenment. The virtual experience will mimic the pilgrimage experience through course materials, exercises, reflection, and following the Way of St. James virtually. As they do so, participants will experience the type of enlightenment that pilgrims experience on the Way of St. James. © 2021 Dublin Institute of Technology. All rights reserved.","Gehrke, J.

278275,Neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 infection in Asia: a systematic review,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a respiratory viral infection with unique features including a more chronic course and systemic disease manifestations including multiple organ involvement; and there are differences in disease severity between ethnic groups. The immunological basis for disease has not been fully characterised. Analysis of whole-blood RNA expression may provide valuable information on disease pathogenesis. METHODS: We studied 45 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection within 10 days from onset of illness and a control group of 19 asymptomatic healthy volunteers with no known exposure to COVID-19 in the previous 14 days. Relevant demographic and clinical information was collected and a blood sample was drawn from all participants for whole-blood RNA sequencing. We evaluated differentially-expressed genes in COVID-19 patients (log2 fold change &#8805; 1 versus healthy controls; false-discovery rate < 0.05) and associated protein pathways and compared these to published whole-blood signatures for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. We developed a disease score reflecting the overall magnitude of expression of internally-validated genes and assessed the relationship between the disease score and clinical disease parameters. RESULTS: We found 135 differentially-expressed genes in the patients with COVID-19 (median age 35 years; 82% male; 36% Chinese, 53% South Asian ethnicity). Of the 117 induced genes, 14 were found in datasets from RSV and 40 from influenza; 95 genes were unique to COVID-19. Protein pathways were mostly generic responses to viral infections, including apoptosis by P53-associated pathway, but also included some unique pathways such as viral carcinogenesis. There were no major qualitative differences in pathways between ethnic groups. The composite gene-expression score was correlated with the time from onset of symptoms and nasal swab qPCR CT values (both p < 0.01) but was not related to participant age, gender, ethnicity or the presence or absence of chest X-ray abnormalities (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The whole-blood transcriptome of COVID-19 has overall similarity with other respiratory infections but there are some unique pathways that merit further exploration to determine clinical relevance. The approach to a disease score may be of value, but needs further validation in a population with a greater range of disease severity.","Kwan, Philip Kam Weng; Cross, Gail B; Naftalin, Claire M; Ahidjo, Bintou A; Mok, Chee Keng; Fanusi, Felic; Permata Sari, Intan; Chia, Siok Ching; Kumar, Shoban Krishna; Alagha, Rawan; Tham, Sai Meng; Archuleta, Sophia; Sessions, October M; Hibberd, Martin L; Paton, Nicholas I",BMC Med Genomics,,247

National surveys assessing vaccination willingness and reports of vaccination administration by race/ethnicity indicate at least two areas that warrant attention: elevated vaccine hesitancy among African American and Latino adults, and the need to ensure equitable access to vaccination. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is not uniform within racial/ethnic minority populations; yet, given the disproportionate impact, understandable distrust, and widespread misinformation, there is an imperative to overcome challenges associated with vaccination willingness and uptake, as well as implementation and access. This Perspective discusses the complexity of drivers for each of these areas, which include individual, community, and structural factors. It also highlights two initiatives at the National Institutes of Health. One is focused on addressing misinformation and distrust through academic-community partnerships, and the other on community-engaged behavioral interventions to address the population-specific reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, support informed decision-making, and promote equitable access among populations with health disparities. For the foreseeable future, proactive and persistent efforts around COVID-19 mitigation strategies, including vaccination, will remain of paramount importance for health equity.","Webb Hooper, Monica; Nápoles, Anna María; Pérez-Stable, Eliseo J",J. gen. intern. med,,247

Using an Internet-based remote meeting technology, we transitioned to a virtual platform in April. METHODS: We have conducted 12 PFAC meetings across 4 sites to date. Virtual PFAC meeting topics over the past few months include communication about the coronavirus, community resources needed by patients during the pandemic, telehealth visit troubleshooting, current office policy, and changing work flow. A convenience sample of advisors generated qualitative responses on the transition from in-person meetings to a virtual platform. RESULTS: Attendance increased as we transitioned to a virtual platform from 13.2 advisors to 14.7 advisors. Advisors affirm the value of a PFAC and importance of patient engagement, especially during this pandemic. Patient advisors confirm the role of patient voice in pandemic-induced practice changes. DISCUSSION: The transition of our PFACs to a virtual platform continues to generate critically important partnerships between patients and providers. In this time of health care uncertainty and stress for patients, providers, and staff, this partnership remains our most valuable asset. CONCLUSION: Patient voice provides reliable and relevant information for practices through virtual PFAC meetings.","Schlaudecker, Jeffrey D; Goodnow, Keesha",J Am Board Fam Med,,247

This variational framework was exploited on normed spaces in Duruisseaux et al. using time-adaptive geometric integrators to design efficient explicit algorithms for symplectic accelerated optimization, and it was observed that geometric discretizations which respect the time-rescaling invariance and symplecticity of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian flows were substantially less prone to stability issues, and were therefore more robust, reliable, and computationally efficient. As such, it is natural to develop time-adaptive Hamiltonian variational integrators for accelerated optimization on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we consider the case of Riemannian manifolds embedded in a Euclidean space that can be characterized as the level set of a submersion. We will explore how holonomic constraints can be incorporated in discrete variational integrators to constrain the numerical discretization of the Riemannian Hamiltonian system to the Riemannian manifold, and we will test the performance of the resulting algorithms by solving eigenvalue and Procrustes problems formulated as optimization problems on the unit sphere and Stiefel manifold.","Duruisseaux, Valentin; Leok, Melvin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07176v1.pdf,247

282246,Gene expression profiling of corona virus microarray datasets to identify crucial targets in COVID-19 patients,2021,"We compare several different ways of measuring the energy resolution for meV-resolved inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS): using scattering from poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, using scattering from borosilicate glass (Tempax), and using powder diffraction from aluminum. All of these methods provide a reasonable first approximation to the energy resolution, but, also, in all cases, inelastic contributions appear over some range of energy transfers. Over a range of +-15 meV energy transfer there is good agreement between the measurements of PMMA and Tempax at low temperature, and room temperature powder diffraction from aluminum so we consider this to be a good indication of the true resolution of our ~1.3 meV spectrometer. We self-consistently determine the resolution over a wider energy range using the temperature, momentum and sample dependence of the measured response. We then quantitatively investigate the inelastic contributions from the PMMA and Tempax, and their dependence on momentum transfer and temperature. The resulting data allows us to determine the resolution of our multi-analyzer array efficiently using a single scan. We demonstrate the importance of this procedure by showing that the results of the analysis of a spectrum from a glass are changed by using the properly deconvolved resolution function. We also discuss the impact of radiation damage on the scattering from PMMA and Tempax.","Ishikawa, Daisuke; Baron, Alfred Q.R.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04002v2.pdf,247

285034,Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis in a Patient With COVID-19 and a LVAD,2020,"Hypertensive disorders are the most common medical complications of pregnancy and a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and death. The detection of elevated blood pressure during pregnancy is one of the cardinal aspects of optimal antenatal care. With the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the risk for person-to-person spread of the virus, there is a desire to minimize unnecessary visits to health care facilities. Women should be classified as low risk or high risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and adjustments can be accordingly made in the frequency of maternal and fetal surveillance. During this pandemic, all pregnant women should be encouraged to obtain a sphygmomanometer. Patients monitored for hypertension as an outpatient should receive written instructions on the important signs and symptoms of disease progression and provided contact information to report the development of any concern for change in status. As the clinical management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is the same, assessment of urinary protein is unnecessary in the management once a diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is made. Pregnant women with suspected hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and signs and symptoms associated with the severe end of the disease spectrum (e.g., headaches, visual symptoms, epigastric pain, and pulmonary edema) should have an evaluation including complete blood count, serum creatinine level, and liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase). Further, if there is any evidence of disease progression or if acute severe hypertension develops, prompt hospitalization is suggested. Current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) for management of preeclampsia with severe features suggest delivery after 34 0/7 weeks of gestation. With the outbreak of COVID-19, however, adjustments to this algorithm should be considered including delivery by 30 0/7 weeks of gestation in the setting of preeclampsia with severe features. KEY POINTS: · Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) warrants fewer office visits.. · Women should be classified for hypertension risk in pregnancy.. · Earlier delivery suggested with COVID-19 and hypertensive disorder..","Barton, John R; Saade, George R; Sibai, Baha M",Am J Perinatol,,247

Existing studies have shown that re-positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 2.4% to 19.8%, the median of interval between re-positive detection and discharge was 4-15 days. Following the second course of the disease, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG and IgA positive rates of the cases were 11.11%-86.08%, 52.00%-100.00% and 61.54%-100.00% respectively, the total antibody and neutralizing antibody positive rates were 98.72% and 88.46%. The viral load of the re-positive cases was lower than that of in the initial infection. At least 3380 re-positive cases have been reported globally. SARS-CoV-2 strains were isolated from the samples of 3 re-positive cases (1 immunodeficiency case and 2 cases with abnormal pulmonary imaging). There were close contacts that were infected by an asymptomatic case taking immunosuppressive agents. In conclusion, the infectivity of re-positive cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 is generally very low. Rare re-positive cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 might cause further transmission. The management approach for the re-positive cases can be based on the assessment of the individual transmission risk according to the pathogen detection results.","Li, Z L; Li, Y; Chen, Q L; Yang, X K; Zhao, H T; Jiang, X L; Fan, S M; Li, D; Qin, Y; Peng, Z B; Yu, J X; Mao, N Y; Li, Z J",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,247

The aim of this study was to examine patients with IBD's adherence to the restrictions imposed by society and the hospital, worries and concerns regarding medical treatment and clinical follow-up under the pandemic. METHODS: IBD patients (&#8805;18 years) at the outpatient clinic at Oslo University Hospital were included and answered a self-report questionnaire including concerns regarding their disease, medical therapy and follow-up during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 522 IBD patients were included, 317 Crohn's disease, 205 ulcerative colitis, 386 patients <50 years. Eighteen percent were in obligatory quarantine, and more often patients <50 years compared to patients &#8805;50 years. Five patients tested positive to SARS- CoV-2. A higher proportion <50 years reported worries for their medical treatment and risk of COVID -19 disease compared to those &#8805;50 years. Forty percent avoided family, two-thirds avoided friends, and 4% cancelled their scheduled consultation at the hospital. The hospital changed physical consultation to telephone consultation for 15% of the patients. The preferred follow-up was physical consultation. A higher proportion of the patients <50 years preferred telephone consultation compared to those &#8805;50 years.

286881,Challenges of pancreatic cancer chemotherapy in the COVID-19 era,2020,"Purpose: On March 16, 2020, the Spanish government declared a state of alarm due to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were restricted to remain confined at home, and medical visits were cancelled for 3 months. The impact of this lockdown on the manifestations of COPD and the quality-of-life of these patients has not been explored. Patients and Methods: One hundred patients with COPD were interviewed by telephone from May 2-18, 2020. The interviews included questions about the lockdown, missed medical appointments, fears of the disease, possible COVID-19 infection, and exacerbations of COPD suffered during this period and their management. In addition, the COPD Assessment Test, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression, and the 5-Dimension Euro Quality-of-Life questionnaires were administered. Results: Sixty-four (64%) patients claimed to have strictly complied with the lockdown, and only 42 (42%) stated they had left home at least once during lockdown. Only one patient (1%) was hospitalized due to COVID-19, and 13 (13%) patients presented an exacerbation of COPD self-managed at home with no admissions due to exacerbation of COPD during this period. A medical consultation or complementary test was cancelled in 90% of the patients, but 61% had a medical telephone visit with a high degree of satisfaction (mean 9.3/10). Most patients declared that their feeling regarding lung disease and general health was similar or even better during lockdown (82% and 81%, respectively). Conclusion: Our results indicate that in general lockdown had a low impact on COPD patients. Only one patient was affected by COVID-19, but moderate exacerbations of COPD were not infrequent. Although many medical visits and test were cancelled, patients were very satisfied with the medical telephone visits.","Pleguezuelos, Eulogio; Del Carmen, Amin; Moreno, Eva; Ortega, Pilar; Vila, Xavier; Ovejero, Laura; Serra-Prat, Mateu; Palomera, Elisabet; Garnacho-Castaño, Manuel Vicente; Loeb, Eduardo; Farago, Georgina; Miravitlles, Marc",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,,247

287038,Reply to: Standardized 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Measurements in Parkinson’s Disease Patients With COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Social media is a rich source where we can learn about people's reactions to social issues. As COVID-19 has impacted people's lives, it is essential to capture how people react to public health interventions and understand their concerns. OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate people's reactions and concerns about COVID-19 in North America, especially in Canada. METHODS: We analyzed COVID-19-related tweets using topic modeling and aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), and interpreted the results with public health experts. To generate insights on the effectiveness of specific public health interventions for COVID-19, we compared timelines of topics discussed with the timing of implementation of interventions, synergistically including information on people's sentiment about COVID-19-related aspects in our analysis. In addition, to further investigate anti-Asian racism, we compared timelines of sentiments for Asians and Canadians. RESULTS: Topic modeling identified 20 topics, and public health experts provided interpretations of the topics based on top-ranked words and representative tweets for each topic. The interpretation and timeline analysis showed that the discovered topics and their trend are highly related to public health promotions and interventions such as physical distancing, border restrictions, handwashing, staying home, and face coverings. After training the data using ABSA with human-in-the-loop, we obtained 545 aspect terms (eg, ""vaccines,"" ""economy,"" and ""masks"") and 60 opinion terms such as ""infectious"" (negative) and ""professional"" (positive), which were used for inference of sentiments of 20 key aspects selected by public health experts. The results showed negative sentiments related to the overall outbreak, misinformation and Asians, and positive sentiments related to physical distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses using natural language processing techniques with domain expert involvement can produce useful information for public health. This study is the first to analyze COVID-19-related tweets in Canada in comparison with tweets in the United States by using topic modeling and human-in-the-loop domain-specific ABSA. This kind of information could help public health agencies to understand public concerns as well as what public health messages are resonating in our populations who use Twitter, which can be helpful for public health agencies when designing a policy for new interventions.","Jang, Hyeju; Rempel, Emily; Roth, David; Carenini, Giuseppe; Janjua, Naveed Zafar",J Med Internet Res,,247

However, there are few reports on these biological activities in fish. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of baicalin on growth performance, antioxidative status and hepatoprotection in tilapia. The fish were fed on different doses of baicalin (0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 g/kg diet). After feeding 60 days, parts of fishes were netted, and the blood, liver, gills and muscle tissues were collected to analyze the antioxidative effect. The remaining fishes were injected with saline or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for challenge test. The results showed that the specific growth rate of fish was slightly increased in three baicalin treatments, and the feed efficiency was clearly improved in 0.4 g/kg baicalin treatment. Meanwhile, the antioxidative capacity in blood, liver and/or gill was enhanced in treatments with 0.4, 0.8 and/or 1.6 g/kg baicalin. After challenge test, the pre-treatments with baicalin effectively alleviated H2O2-induced liver injury. In serum and liver, pre-treatments with 0.8 and/or 1.6 g/kg baicalin suppressed the oxidative damage induced by H2O2, as evidenced by improvement of the levels of SOD, T-AOC and GSH and the decline of MDA level. More important, pre-treatments with 0.4, 0.8 and/or 1.6 g/kg baicalin blocked the upregulation of mRNA levels of tlr1, myd88, irak4, rela, tnf-&#945; and il-1ß in H2O2-induced liver injury. In summary, dietary baicalin supplementation could improve feed efficiency, enhance antioxidative ability and alleviate oxidative stress-induced hepatotoxicity in tilapia.","Jia, Rui; Du, Jinliang; Cao, Liping; Feng, Wengrong; Xu, Pao; Yin, Guojun",Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol,,247

Interleague, deidentified cardiac data were pooled for collective analysis. Those with abnormal screening test results were referred for additional testing, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and/or stress echocardiography. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of abnormal RTP test results potentially representing COVID-19-associated cardiac injury, and results and outcomes of additional testing generated by the initial screening process. Results: The study included 789 professional athletes (mean [SD] age, 25 [3] years; 777 men [98.5%]). A total of 460 athletes (58.3%) had prior symptomatic COVID-19 illness, and 329 (41.7%) were asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic (minimally symptomatic). Testing was performed a mean (SD) of 19 (17) days (range, 3-156 days) after a positive test result. Abnormal screening results were identified in 30 athletes (3.8%; troponin, 6 athletes [0.8%]; ECG, 10 athletes [1.3%]; echocardiography, 20 athletes [2.5%]), necessitating additional testing; 5 athletes (0.6%) ultimately had cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings suggesting inflammatory heart disease (myocarditis, 3; pericarditis, 2) that resulted in restriction from play. No adverse cardiac events occurred in athletes who underwent cardiac screening and resumed professional sport participation. Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides large-scale data assessing the prevalence of relevant COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology with implementation of current RTP screening recommendations. While long-term follow-up is ongoing, few cases of inflammatory heart disease have been detected, and a safe return to professional sports activity has thus far been achieved.","Martinez, Matthew W; Tucker, Andrew M; Bloom, O Josh; Green, Gary; DiFiori, John P; Solomon, Gary; Phelan, Dermot; Kim, Jonathan H; Meeuwisse, Willem; Sills, Allen K; Rowe, Dana; Bogoch, Isaac I; Smith, Paul T; Baggish, Aaron L; Putukian, Margot; Engel, David J",JAMA Cardiol,,247
295214,Isolated Third Cranial Nerve Palsy and COVID-19 Infection in a Child,2021,"Despite encouraging progresses achieved in the management of viral diseases, efficient strategies to counteract infections are still required. The current global challenge highlighted the need to develop a rapid and cost-effective strategy to counteract the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Lipid metabolism plays a crucial role in viral infections. Viruses can use the host lipid machinery to support their life cycle and to impair the host immune response. The altered expression of mevalonate pathway-related genes, induced by several viruses, assures survival and spread in host tissue. In some infections, statins, HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors, reduce cholesterol in the plasma membrane of permissive cells resulting in lower viral titers and failure to internalize the virus. Statins can also counteract viral infections through their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects. Beyond statins, interfering with the mevalonate pathway could have an adjuvant effect in therapies aimed at mitigating endothelial dysfunction and deregulated inflammation in viral infection. In this review we depicted the historical and current evidence highlighting how lipid homeostasis and mevalonate pathway targeting represents a valid approach to rapidly neutralize viruses, focusing our attention to their potential use as effective targets to hinder SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality. Pros and cons of statins and Mevalonate-pathway inhibitors have been also dissected.","Proto, Maria Chiara; Fiore, Donatella; Piscopo, Chiara; Pagano, Cristina; Galgani, Mario; Bruzzaniti, Sara; Laezza, Chiara; Gazzerro, Patrizia; Bifulco, Maurizio",Prog Lipid Res,,247

However, these drugs may interact with a variety of biological macromolecules and cause serious toxicology, so how to reactivate the inhibited targets seems to be imperative in the near future. Organophosphate was an extreme example, which could form a covalent bound easily with acetylcholinesterase and irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, causing high toxicology. Some nucleophilic oxime reactivators for organophosphate poisoned acetylcholinesterase had been developed, but the reactivation process was still less understanding. Herein, we proposed there should be a pre-reactivated pose during the reactivating process and compounds whose binding pose was easy to transfer to the pre-reactivated pose might be efficient reactivators. Then we refined the previous reactivators based on the molecular dynamic simulation results, the resulting compounds L7R3 and L7R5 were proven as much more efficient reactivators for organophosphate inhibited acetylcholinesterase than currently used oximes. This work might provide some insights for constructing reactivators of covalently inhibited targets by using computational methods.","Wei, Zhao; Yang, Jie; Liu, Yanqin; Nie, Huifang; Yao, Lin; Yang, Jun; Guo, Lei; Zheng, Zhibing; Ouyang, Qin",Eur J Med Chem,,247

Data was collected through participant observation and focus group discussions during the implementation of a social aid campaign targeted to this population and analyzed through reflexive theoretical thematic analysis. Resistance strategies were understood as forms of social capital grounded in relations of support and connectedness. Results underscored the importance of social cohesion to ameliorate increasing levels of precarity, community leaders as key for linking trans women across different networks, and unified efforts of social groups who share values to influence institutional power. The analysis also captured barriers and challenges that could hinder the development and articulation of social capital. Fostering trust relations and community-organization should be fundamental components for advocacy programs that seek to support the trans women community.","Garcia-Rabines, Diego; Bencich, Bruno",J Homosex,,247

296066,CT Scanning in Suspected Stroke or Head Trauma: Is it Worth Going the Extra Mile and Including the Chest to Screen for COVID-19 Infection?,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to be a world-wide pandemic with overwhelming socioeconomic impact. Since inflammation is one of the major causes of COVID-19 complications, the associated molecular mechanisms have been the focus of many studies to better understand this disease and develop improved treatments for patients contracting SARS-CoV-2. Among these, strong emphasis has been placed on pro-inflammatory cytokines, associating severity of COVID-19 with so-called ""cytokine storm."" More recently, peptide bradykinin, its dysregulated signaling or ""bradykinin storm,"" has emerged as a primary mechanism to explain COVID-19-related complications. Unfortunately, this important development may not fully capture the main molecular players that underlie the disease severity. To this end, in this focused review, several lines of evidence are provided to suggest that in addition to bradykinin, two closely related vasoactive peptides, substance P and neurotensin, are also likely to drive microvascular permeability and inflammation, and be responsible for development of COVID-19 pathology. Furthermore, based on published experimental observations, it is postulated that in addition to ACE and neprilysin, peptidase neurolysin (Nln) is also likely to contribute to accumulation of bradykinin, substance P and neurotensin, and progression of the disease. In conclusion, it is proposed that ""vasoactive peptide storm"" may underlie severity of COVID-19 and that simultaneous inhibition of all three peptidergic systems could be therapeutically more advantageous rather than modulation of any single mechanism alone.","Karamyan, Vardan T",Physiol Rep,,247

Here, we performed a meta-analysis to summarize the epidemiological and radiographical characteristics of asymptomatic infections associated with COVID-19. METHODS: Data on the epidemiological and radiographical characteristics of asymptomatic infections were extracted from the existing literature. Pooled proportions with 95% confidence intervals were then calculated using a random effects model. RESULTS: A total of 104 studies involving 20,152 cases were included. The proportion of asymptomatic individuals among those with COVID-19 was 13.34% (10.86%-16.29%), among which presymptomatic and covert infections accounted for 7.64% (4.02%-14.04%) and 8.44% (5.12%-13.62%), respectively. The proportions of asymptomatic infections among infected children and healthcare workers were 32.24% (23.08%-42.13%) and 36.96% (18.51%-60.21%), respectively. The proportion of asymptomatic infections was significantly higher after 2020/02/29 than before (33.53% vs 10.19%) and in non-Asian regions than in Asia (28.76% vs 11.54%). The median viral shedding duration of asymptomatic infections was 14.14 days (11.25-17.04). A total of 47.62% (31.13%-72.87%) of asymptomatic infections showed lung abnormalities, especially ground-glass opacity (41.11% 19.7%-85.79%). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic infections were more commonly found in infected children and healthcare workers and increased after 2020/02/29 and in non-Asian regions.

The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has breached the borders of Europe. Public health surveillance is necessary to inform policy and guide leaders. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for weekly shifts in the pandemic, speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence, to better understand countries at risk for explosive growth and those that are managing the pandemic effectively. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal trend analysis and extracted 62 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in Europe as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: New COVID-19 cases slightly decreased from 158,741 (week 1, January 4-10, 2021) to 152,064 (week 2, January 11-17, 2021), and cumulative cases increased from 22,507,271 (week 1) to 23,890,761 (week 2), with a weekly increase of 1,383,490 between January 10 and January 17. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom had the largest 7-day moving averages for new cases during week 1. During week 2, the 7-day moving average for France and Spain increased.

The process described was equivalent to the oxygen transport system. Furthermore, it was supposed to generate toxic residues, such as free radicals, leading to an irreversible multiple organ failure (MOF), considered a mortality factor as in Covid-19.

308265,Thromboinflammation and COVID-19: The Role of Exercise in the Prevention and Treatment,2020,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, has moved rapidly around the globe, infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands. The basic reproduction number, which has been widely used-appropriately and less appropriately-to characterize the transmissibility of the virus, hides the fact that transmission is stochastic, often dominated by a small number of individuals, and heavily influenced by superspreading events (SSEs). The distinct transmission features of SARS-CoV-2, e.g., high stochasticity under low prevalence (as compared to other pathogens, such as influenza), and the central role played by SSEs on transmission dynamics cannot be overlooked. Many explosive SSEs have occurred in indoor settings, stoking the pandemic and shaping its spread, such as long-term care facilities, prisons, meat-packing plants, produce processing facilities, fish factories, cruise ships, family gatherings, parties, and nightclubs. These SSEs demonstrate the urgent need to understand routes of transmission, while posing an opportunity to effectively contain outbreaks with targeted interventions to eliminate SSEs. Here, we describe the different types of SSEs, how they influence transmission, empirical evidence for their role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and give recommendations for control of SARS-CoV-2.","Althouse, Benjamin M; Wenger, Edward A; Miller, Joel C; Scarpino, Samuel V; Allard, Antoine; Hébert-Dufresne, Laurent; Hu, Hao",PLoS Biol,,247

To estimate seroprevalence, underreported infections, and IFR for the Tirschenreuth population aged &#8805;14 years in June/July 2020, we conducted a population-based study including home visits for the elderly, and analyzed 4203 participants for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies via three antibody tests. Latent class analysis yielded 8.6% standardized county-wide seroprevalence, a factor of underreported infections of 5.0, and 2.5% overall IFR. Seroprevalence was two-fold higher among medical workers and one third among current smokers with similar proportions of registered infections. While seroprevalence did not show an age-trend, the factor of underreported infections was 12.2 in the young versus 1.7 for &#8805;85-year-old. Age-specific IFRs were <0.5% below 60 years of age, 1.0% for age 60-69, and 13.2% for age 70+. Senior care homes accounted for 45% of COVID-19-related deaths, reflected by an IFR of 7.5% among individuals aged 70+ and an overall IFR of 1.4% when excluding senior care home residents from our computation. Our data underscore senior care home infections as key determinant of IFR additionally to age, insufficient targeted testing in the young, and the need for further investigations on behavioral or molecular causes of the fewer infections among current smokers.","Wagner, Ralf; Peterhoff, David; Beileke, Stephanie; Günther, Felix; Berr, Melanie; Einhauser, Sebastian; Schütz, Anja; Niller, Hans Helmut; Steininger, Philipp; Knöll, Antje; Tenbusch, Matthias; Maier, Clara; Korn, Klaus; Stark, Klaus J; Gessner, André; Burkhardt, Ralph; Kabesch, Michael; Schedl, Holger; Küchenhoff, Helmut; Pfahlberg, Annette B; Heid, Iris M; Gefeller, Olaf; Überla, Klaus",Viruses,,247
308513,Peripheral nerve blocks for above-the-knee amputation in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia,2021,"It has become increasingly clear that the COVID-19 epidemic is characterized by overdispersion whereby the majority of the transmission is driven by a minority of infected individuals. Such a strong departure from the homogeneity assumptions of the traditional well-mixed compartment model is usually hypothesized to be the result of short-term super-spreader events, such as an individual's extreme rate of virus shedding at the peak of infectivity while attending a large gathering without appropriate mitigation. However, we demonstrate that the spread of epidemics is primarily sensitive to long-term, or persistent heterogeneity of individual susceptibility or infectivity. We demonstrate how to incorporate this heterogeneity into a wide class of epidemiological models, and derive a non-linear dependence of the effective reproduction number Re on the susceptible population fraction S. Persistent heterogeneity has three important consequences compared to the effects of short-term overdispersion: (1) It results in a major modification of the early epidemic dynamics; (2) It significantly suppresses the herd immunity threshold; (3) It also significantly reduces the final size of the epidemic. We estimate social and biological contributions to persistent heterogeneity using data on real-life face-to-face contact networks and age variation of the incidence rate during the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition, empirical data from the COVID-19 epidemic in New York City (NYC) and Chicago, as well as 50 US states provide a consistent characterization of the level of heterogeneity. Our estimates suggest that the hardest-hit areas, such as NYC, are close to the heterogeneity-modified herd immunity threshold following the first wave of the epidemic. However, this type of immunity is fragile as it wanes over time if the pattern of social interactions changes substantially.","Tkachenko, Alexei V.; Maslov, Sergei; Elbanna, Ahmed; Wong, George N.; Weiner, Zachary J.; Goldenfeld, Nigel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08142v1.pdf,247
308578,Case Fatality Rate of Cancer Patients with COVID-19 in a New York Hospital System,2020,"P. aeruginosa is classified as a priority one pathogen by the World Health Organisation, and new drugs are urgently needed, due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Antimicrobial-resistant nosocomial pathogens such as P. aeruginosa pose unwavering and increasing threats. Antimicrobial stewardship has been a challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a majority of those hospitalized with SARS-CoV2 infection given antibiotics as a safeguard against secondary bacterial infection. This increased usage, along with increased handling of sanitizers and disinfectants globally, may further accelerate the development and spread of cross-resistance to antibiotics. In addition, P. aeruginosa is the primary causative agent of morbidity and mortality in people with the life-shortening genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). Prolonged periods of selective pressure, associated with extended antibiotic treatment and the actions of host immune effectors, results in widespread adaptive and acquired resistance in P. aeruginosa found colonizing the lungs of people with CF. This review discusses the arsenal of resistance mechanisms utilized by P. aeruginosa, how these operate under high-stress environments such as the CF lung and how their interconnectedness can result in resistance to multiple antibiotic classes. Intrinsic, adaptive and acquired resistance mechanisms will be described, with a focus on how each layer of resistance can serve as a building block, contributing to multi-tiered resistance to antimicrobial activity. Recent progress in the development of anti-resistance adjuvant therapies, targeting one or more of these building blocks, should lead to novel strategies for combatting multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa. Anti-resistance adjuvant therapy holds great promise, not least because resistance against such therapeutics is predicted to be rare. The non-bactericidal nature of anti-resistance adjuvants reduce the selective pressures that drive resistance. Anti-resistance adjuvant therapy may also be advantageous in facilitating efficacious use of traditional antimicrobials, through enhanced penetration of the antibiotic into the bacterial cell. Promising anti-resistance adjuvant therapeutics and targets will be described, and key remaining challenges highlighted. As antimicrobial stewardship becomes more challenging in an era of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and global conflict, innovation in antibiotic adjuvant therapy can play an important role in extending the shelf-life of our existing antimicrobial therapeutic agents.","Langendonk, R Frèdi; Neill, Daniel R; Fothergill, Joanne L",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,247

Baseline information and clinical records of 40 patients were collected, including demographic data, disease status, medication, and laboratory routine. The correlation between the inspection indicators and disease classification, as well as prognostic factors, was analyzed. Decreased eosinophils were detected in 33 out of 40 patients with COVID-19 on admission, while lymphocytes and eosinophils were inversely related to the severity of the disease, according to the Spearman's correlation coefficient. Thus, it could be deduced that eosinophils have better sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and play a major role similar to lymphocytes in assessing the prognosis of patients.","Tan, Yingzheng; Zhou, Juan; Zhou, Qing; Hu, Lingli; Long, Yunzhu",J. med. virol,,247

Even though entry routes of P. salmonis in fish are not fully clear yet, the skin seems to be the main portal in some salmonid species. Despite the importance of fish mucous skin barrier in fighting waterborne pathogens, the interaction between salmonid skin mucus and the bacterium is unknown. This study seeks to determine the in vitro changes in the growth of two Chilean P. salmonis strains (LF-89-like and EM-90-like genotypes) and the type strain LF-89T under exposures to skin mucus from Salmo salar and Oncorhynchus mykiss, as well as changes in the cytotoxic effect of P. salmonis on the SHK-1 cells following exposures. The results suggest that the growth of three P. salmonis strains was not significantly negatively affected under exposures to skin mucus (adjusted at 100 µg total protein ml-1 ) of O. mykiss (69 ± 18 U lysozyme ml-1 ) and S. salar (48 ± 33 U lysozyme ml-1 ) over time. However, the cytotoxic effect of P. salmonis, pre-exposed to salmonid skin mucus, on the SHK-1 cell line was reliably identified only towards the end of the incubation period, suggesting that the mucus had a delaying effect on the cytotoxic response of the cell line to the bacterium. These results represent a baseline knowledge to open new avenues of research intended to understand how P. salmonis faces the fish mucous skin barrier.","Levipan, Héctor A; Avendaño-Herrera, Ruben",J. fish dis,,247

310883,Can we prevent COVID-19 from causing victims among uninfected cancer patients?,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmits from person to person mainly through respiratory droplets and coughing. Infection severity ranges from asymptomatic and mild infection to those with moderate and severe symptoms which may lead to multiple organ failure and mortality. Infection severity largely depends on individual's immune response, age and co-morbidities. Present study categorized COVID-19 infected patients based on their infection severity and linked COVID-19 severity with age, gender and ABO blood group types. Clinical details of 383 COVID-19 patients were collected from Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital (RGSSH), India; divided into three groups; mild, moderate and severe patients, based on their symptoms. Present analysis revealed that age plays major role in infection severity, as the symptoms are more severe in patients above 45 years. Infection rate was higher in males compared to females. Most patients with A(+ve) and B(+ve) blood group were severely affected compared to those of blood group type O(+ve) and AB(+ve). O(+ve) blood group was least represented in severe patients. Present findings could be helpful in generating awareness amongst the population regarding susceptibility towards the COVID-19 infection. This supportive information would help clinicians and health workers to propose new strategies and tactical solution against COVID-19 infection.","Garg, Iti; Srivastava, Swati; Dogra, Vikas; Bargotya, Mona; Bhattar, Sonali; Gupta, Utkarsh; Jain, Shruti; Hussain, Javid; Hembrom, Anju A; Ghosh, Nilanjana; Kumar, Vinay; Kumar, Bhuvnesh; Varshney, Rajeev; Ganju, Lilly",Microb Pathog,,247
311211,Emergent Inpatient Administration of Casirivimab and Imdevimab Antibody Cocktail for the Treatment of COVID-19 Pneumonia,2021,"As COVID-19 exemplifies, respiratory diseases transmitted through aerosols or droplets are global threats to public health, and respiratory protection measures are essential first lines of infection prevention and control. However, common face masks are single use and can cause cross-infection due to the accumulated infectious pathogens. We developed salt-based formulations to coat membrane fibers to fabricate antimicrobial filters. Here, we report a mechanistic study on salt-induced pathogen inactivation. The salt recrystallization following aerosol exposure was characterized over time on sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium sulfate (K2SO4), and potassium chloride (KCl) powders and coatings, which revealed that NaCl and KCl start to recrystallize within 5 min and K2SO4 within 15 min. The inactivation kinetics observed for the H1N1 influenza virus and Klebsiella pneumoniae matched the salt recrystallization well, which was identified as the main destabilizing mechanism. Additionally, the salt-coated filters were prepared with different methods (with and without a vacuum process), which led to salt coatings with different morphologies for diverse applications. Finally, the salt-coated filters caused a loss of pathogen viability independent of transmission mode (aerosols or droplets), against both DI water and artificial saliva suspensions. Overall, these findings increase our understanding of the salt-recrystallization-based technology to develop highly versatile antimicrobial filters.","Rubino, Ilaria; Han, Sumin; Oh, Euna; Kumaran, Surjith; Lawson, Matthew; Jung, Yu-Jin; Kim, Ki-Hye; Bhatnagar, Noopur; Lee, Su-Hwa; Kang, Hae-Ji; Lee, Dong-Hun; Chu, Ki-Back; Kang, Sang-Moo; Quan, Fu-Shi; Choi, Hyo-Jick",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,,247

A mixed-methods study was conducted to explore the impact of the pandemic on Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) practice. The quantitative component involved a survey of CRNAs during the initial period of the pandemic to determine changes in practice and any relationship to removal of state and federal barriers. Approximately 16% of 2,202 responding CRNAs reported practice expansion beyond their normal responsibilities, primarily outside the operating room and involving tracheal intubation, ventilator management, arterial line placement, and central line placement. CRNAs were more likely to experience an expansion of practice in states affected by removal of regulatory barriers. However, respondents also reported missed opportunities to use the full expertise of CRNAs because of state and institutional restrictions.

Methods: Anonymous network sampling survey was carried out with an electronic questionnaire that designed by the questionnaire star, and a total of 4016 subjects from Anhui province were investigated. The content of the survey includes that the basic information of subjects,the residents' knowledge, attitudes and practice about NCP, as well as their satisfaction with the prevention and control measures adopted by the government and health authorities and the suggestions on future prevention. The questionnaire doesn't involve any privacy information, and all questions were mandatory to ensure the response rate. Results: The M (P(25), P(75)) age the 4016 subjects was 21 (19, 24), and the ranging from 7 to 80 years old. The number of males was1431(35.6%). Social networking tools such as WeChat and QQ were the main sources of epidemic information for residents (97.8%, 3 929 respondents). Residents have a high awareness rate of the main symptoms, transmission routes, using of masks, hand washing and treatment information of NCP, while a low awareness rate of the atypical symptoms. 92.6% of the subjects (n=3 720) think that the outbreak was scary. In terms of psychological behavior scores, the results showed that female (9.38±4.81), the urban (9.37±5.02) and the medical workers (10.79±5.19) had a poorer mental health than the male (8.45±5.00) , the rural (8.71±4.75) and the non-medical workers (the students: 8.85±4.83; public institude workers: 9.02±5.08; others: 8.97±5.39) (P < 0.05). 71.9% of the residents (n=2 887)were satisfied with the local epidemic control measures. The residents took various of the measures to prevent and control the epidemic. The ratio of residents that could achieve ""no gathering and less going out"" , ""wear masks when going out"" and ""do not go to crowded and closed places"" was up to 97.4% (n=3 913), 93.6% (n=3758) and 91.5% (n=3 673) respectively.

Most of the affected countries took several measures, like lockdowns, business shutdowns, hygiene regulations, social distancing, school and university closings, or mobility tracking as a means of slowing down the distribution of COVID-19. These measures are expected to show short-term and long-term effects on people's working lives. However, most media reports focused on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in work arrangements (e.g., short-time work, flexible location and hours) for workers in a regular employment relationship. We here focus on workers in flexible employment relationships (e.g. temporary agency work and other forms of subcontracted labor, as well as new forms of working, such as in the gig economy). Specifically, we will discuss (a) how the work and careers of individuals in flexible employment relationships might get affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) outline ideas how to examine period effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the work and careers of those individuals, and (c) outline how the pandemic can contribute to the ramification of flexible employment relationships.","Spurk, Daniel; Straub, Caroline",J Vocat Behav,,247

The consequences could be even more severe for those more vulnerable to the disease, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Indeed, there is evidence that such vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected in terms of both, their health and the socioeconomic impact. The aim of our study was to determine whether occupational health (OH) professionals thought that the COVID-19 pandemic might further disadvantage any particular group(s) of vulnerable workers globally, and if so, which group(s). A cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of OH professionals by means of an online questionnaire which was shared via email within the ICOH (International Commission for Occupational Health) community. Data was collected over a period of two weeks in May 2020 and 165 responses from 52 countries were received. In this paper, the responses relating to questions about vulnerable workers are reported and discussed. Globally, our responders felt that those in less secure jobs (precarious employment (79%) and informal work (69%)), or unemployed (63%), were the most at risk of further disadvantage from this pandemic. The majority felt that their governments could act to mitigate these effects. There were suggestions of short-term alleviation such as financial and social support, as well as calls for fundamental reviews of the underlying inequalities that leave populations so vulnerable to a crisis such as COVID-19.","Tamin, Jacques; Samuel, Oluranti; Suraya, Anna; Ebuenyi, Ikenna D; Naicker, Nisha; Rajput-Ray, Minha",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,247

DESIGN: ""Promoting Active Aging"" (PAA) was a mixed-methods randomized-controlled pilot, to test the feasibility and acceptability of a video-based PA counseling tool and implementation into practice of two mobility assessment tools. SETTING: Three primary care practices affiliated with Wake Forest Baptist Health. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 65 years and older who presented for primary care follow-up and were willing and able to answer self-report questions and walk 4 meters (n = 59). INTERVENTION: Video-based PA counseling intervention versus control video, ""Healthy Eating."" MEASUREMENTS: Potential participants completed mobility assessments: self-report (Mobility Assessment Tool-short form (MAT-sf)) and performance based (4-meter walk test). We assessed PAA's implementation-feasibility, acceptability, and value-via interviews and surveys. Effectiveness was measured via participant attendance at a PA information session. RESULTS: Of 92 patients approached, 89 (96.7%) agreed to mobility assessment. Eighty-nine completed MAT-sf, and 97.8% (87/89) completed 4-meter walk test. Sixty-seven (75%) met eligibility criteria, and 59 (88%) consented to be randomized either to the PA counseling intervention (Video-PA) or to active control (Video-C). Most participants viewed the walk test positively (51/59; 86.4%). Staff reported that completion of patient surveys, MAT-sf, and videos required significant staff time and support (median = 26 minutes for all), resulting in low acceptability of MAT-sf and the videos. Attendance at a PA information session did not differ by randomization group (Video-PA = 11/29 (37.9%); Video-C = 12/30 (40%); 95% confidence interval for difference in proportion = -0.29 to 0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Mobility assessment, particularly a 4-meter walk test, was feasible in primary care. Tablet-based assessment (MAT-sf) and video counseling tools, selected to reduce staff effort, instead required significant time to implement. Future work to promote PA should identify effective ways to facilitate adoption of PA in sedentary older adults that do not burden staff.","Callahan, Kathryn E; Willard, James; Foley, Kristie L; Miller, Michael E; Houston, Denise K; Kritchevsky, Stephen B; Williamson, Jeff D; Applegate, William B; Girma, Feben; Whitehead, Sarah E; Rejeski, W Jack",J. am. geriatr. soc,,247

In this context, a strong synergy between the structural biophysics and molecular modeling and simulation communities has emerged, resolving at the atomistic level the crucial protein apparatus of the virus and revealing the dynamic aspects of key viral processes. In this Review, we focus on how in silico studies have contributed to the understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism and the proposal of novel and original agents to inhibit the viral key functioning. This Review deals with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, including the mode of action that this structural protein uses to entry human cells, as well as with nonstructural viral proteins, focusing the attention on the most studied proteases and also proposing alternative mechanisms involving some of its domains, such as the SARS unique domain. We demonstrate that molecular modeling and simulation represent an effective approach to gather information on key biological processes and thus guide rational molecular design strategies.","Francés-Monerris, Antonio; Hognon, Cécilia; Miclot, Tom; García-Iriepa, Cristina; Iriepa, Isabel; Terenzi, Alessio; Grandemange, Stéphanie; Barone, Giampaolo; Marazzi, Marco; Monari, Antonio",J Proteome Res,,247

The role of domestic livestock and associated risks for humans in close contact with food production animals remains unknown for many species. Determining the susceptibility of pigs to SARS-CoV-2 is critical to a One Health approach to manage potential risk for zoonotic transmission. We found that pigs are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 after oronasal inoculation. Among 16 animals, we detected viral RNA in group oral fluids and in nasal wash from 2 pigs, but live virus was isolated from only 1 pig. Antibodies also were detected in only 2 animals at 11 and 13 days postinoculation but were detected in oral fluid samples at 6 days postinoculation, indicating antibody secretion. These data highlight the need for additional livestock assessment to determine the potential role of domestic animals in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Pickering, Brad S; Smith, Greg; Pinette, Mathieu M; Embury-Hyatt, Carissa; Moffat, Estella; Marszal, Peter; Lewis, Charles E",Emerg Infect Dis,,247

325399,A socially distanced and digitally enhanced COVID-19 rehabilitation programme,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had significant health-related and behavioral impacts worldwide. Cancer survivors (hereafter referred to as ""survivors"") are particularly prone to behavioral changes and are encouraged to be more vigilant and observe stricter social distancing measures. OBJECTIVE: We explored (1) changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviors since the onset of COVID-19, along with changes in mental health status, and (2) alternative strategies to support survivors' physical activity and social health during and after COVID-19, along with the role of digital health in such strategies. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed among survivors participating (currently or previously) in the community-based physical activity program LIVESTRONG at the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), from 3 sites outside an urban area in Massachusetts. Questions addressed pre-COVID-19 vs current changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2) and 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), and scores &#8805;3 indicated a clinical diagnosis of anxiety or depression, respectively. Digital health preferences were assessed through closed-ended questions. Open-ended responses addressing other preferences for physical activity programs and social support were analyzed, coded, and categorized into themes. RESULTS: Among 61 participants (mean age 62 [SD 10.4] years; females: 51/61 [83.6%]), 67.2% (n=41) reported decreased physical activity and 67.2% (n=41) reported prolonged sitting times since the onset of COVID-19. Further, 24.6% (n=15) and 26.2% (n=16) met the GAD-2 and PHQ-2 criteria for clinical anxiety and depression, respectively. All participants owned a cellphone; 90% (n=54) owned a smartphone. Preferences for physical activity programs (n=28) included three themes: (1) use of digital or remote platforms (Zoom, other online platforms, and video platforms), (2) specific activities and locations (eg, outdoor activities, walking, gardening, biking, and physical activities at the YMCA and at senior centers), and (3) importance of social support regardless of activity type (eg, time spent with family, friends, peers, or coaches). The survey revealed a mean score of 71.8 (SD 21.4; scale 0-100) for the importance of social support during physical activity programs. Social support preferences (n=15) revealed three themes: (1) support through remote platforms (eg, texting, Zoom, phone calls, emails, and Facebook), (2) tangible in-person support (YMCA and senior centers), and (3) social support with no specific platform (eg, small gatherings and family or friend visits). CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity and mental health are critical factors for the quality of life of survivors, and interventions tailored to their activity preferences are necessary. Digital or remote physical activity programs with added social support may help address the ongoing needs of survivors during and after the pandemic.","Faro, Jamie M; Mattocks, Kristin M; Nagawa, Catherine S; Lemon, Stephenie C; Wang, Bo; Cutrona, Sarah L; Sadasivam, Rajani S",JMIR Cancer,,247

325799,Thromboembolic Disease in COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Social isolation has been associated with poor sleep quality and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most studies included a heterogeneous sample with variances in social disruption policies and did not focus on a local profile with homogeneous prevention policies. OBJECTIVES: Thus, the present study's purpose was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and sleep quality in a specific region in South of Brazil with similar culture and social distance policies adopted by the local governments. METHODS: This study was conducted with 327 individuals aged 18-72 years, living in ""Vale do Taquari"", Brazil. We assessed sociodemographic variables and depression, anxiety, stress symptoms (DASS-21), sleep quality (The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (Impact of Event Scale-IES-R scale) using an online web-based survey. RESULTS: Our results showed that sleep dysfunction moderated the effects of age on psychological symptoms, indicating that younger participants who had a lower sleep quality presented worse mental health. Further, the participants with more perceived stress during the pandemic and more sleep dysfunction reported more anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms. CONCLUSION: Psychological symptoms were not related to social isolation duration but to the subjective perception that the pandemic interfered with life and generated stressful situations. These results may help governments make important decisions about protection and isolation measures in the future waves of COVID-19 infection.","Bücker, Joana; Rosa, Adriane Ribeiro; Czepielewski, Letícia Sanguinetti",Trends psychiatry psychother.

326516,Use of Remdesivir in Myasthenia gravis and COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the data currently available regarding the repurposing of different drugs for Covid-19 treatment. Participants with suspected or diagnosed Covid-19 will be included. The interventions being considered are drugs being repurposed, and comparators will include standard of care treatment or placebo. METHODS: We searched Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, clinical trial registration site in the UK(NIHR), Europe (clinicaltrialsregister.eu), US (ClinicalTrials.gov) and internationally (isrctn.com), and reviewed the reference lists of articles for eligible articles published up to April 22, 2020. All studies in English that evaluated the efficacy of the listed drugs were included. Cochrane RoB 2.0 and ROBINS-I tool were used to assess study quality. This systematic review adheres to the PRISMA guidelines. The protocol is available at PROSPERO (CRD42020180915). RESULTS: From 708 identified studies or clinical trials, 16 studies and 16 case reports met our eligibility criteria. Of these, 6 were randomized controlled trials (763 patients), 7 cohort studies (321 patients) and 3 case series (191 patients). Chloroquine (CQ) had a 100% discharge rate compared to 50% with lopinavir-ritonavir at day 14, however a trial has recommended against a high dosage due to cardiotoxic events. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has shown no significant improvement in negative seroconversion rate which is also seen in our meta-analysis (p=0.68). Adverse events with HCQ have a significant difference compared to the control group (p=0.001). Lopinavir-ritonavir has shown no improvement in time to clinical improvement which is seen in our meta-analyses (p=0.1). Remdesivir has shown no significant improvement in time to clinical improvement but this trial had insufficient power. DISCUSSION: Due to the paucity in evidence, it is difficult to establish the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of Covid-19 as currently there is no significant clinical effectiveness of the repurposed drugs. Further large clinical trials are required to achieve more reliable findings. A risk-benefit analysis is required on an individual basis to weigh out the potential improvement in clinical outcome and viral load reduction compared to the risks of the adverse events.","Kotecha, Pinky; Light, Alexander; Checcucci, Enrico; Amparore, Daniele; Fiori, Cristian; Porpiglia, Francesco; Dasgupta, Prokar; Elhage, Oussama",Panminerva med,,247

327302,Anosmia in COVID-19 Associated with Injury to the Olfactory Bulbs Evident on MRI,2020,"While adolescents and adults should limit high levels of sedentary behavior, university students spend large amounts of time on sedentary activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of this prolonged sitting on students' self-perceived physical, mental, and cognitive condition and to answer the question of whether simple standing breaks in lectures can help students improve these conditions and for example feel more concentrated, motivated, or less tense in class. A five-minute standing break was introduced using a designed presentation slide for one semester in five different 90-min lectures. In addition, an active break as well as an open break with no trigger were implemented in two further lectures to explicitly investigate the effects of a standing break. Before, during, and after the semester, the students were surveyed about their physical, mental, and cognitive condition (836 respondents at start, 634 during semester, and 528 at the end). To evaluate the practicality and acceptance of the standing break, lecturers were interviewed about their experience. At all survey time points, the standing break was highly accepted by the university students. About three quarters of the students felt a relaxation of the muscles in the neck and shoulder as well as in the back and the legs. More than three quarters perceived an increase in concentration, receptiveness and retentiveness, motivation, and well-being. Results of the statistical analysis indicate that a standing break as well as an active break are more effective than an open break to improve the self-perceived physical and psychological well-being of the university students. The increase in cognitive skills is reported by all groups, including the group who were offered open breaks. Hence, standing breaks in university lectures receive a high level of acceptance and practicability and have the potential to increase students' physical, mental, and cognitive condition and contribute to students' physical activity and health. While field research provides opportunities such as the testing of measures in the natural environment and producing real-life results relevant to the students and lecturers, it also imposes limitations as lecture settings differed, not all disturbances could be controlled, and the participation in the study might have led to social-desirability bias. For a sustainable development of a standing-friendly teaching and learning culture at universities, further interventions as well as the consideration of the topic in all processes and decisions within the universities are necessary. Since this study has taken place, student-life has changed drastically with COVID-19 measures. While this current paper is based on research conducted in 2019 and has only tested live lectures on campus, the tools tested could also be used for online lectures.","Paulus, Maike; Kunkel, Jule; Schmidt, Steffen C E; Bachert, Philip; Wäsche, Hagen; Neumann, Rainer; Woll, Alexander",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,247
327800,A COVID-19 Rehabilitation Prospective Surveillance Model for Use by Physiotherapists,2021,"Residents in long-term care settings are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infections and, compared to younger adults, are at higher risk of poor outcomes and death. Given the poor prognosis of resuscitation outcomes for COVID-19 in general, the specter of COVID-19 in long-term care residents should prompt revisiting goals of care. Visitor restriction policies enacted to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to long-term care residents requires advance care planning discussions to be conducted remotely. A structured approach can help guide discussions regarding the diagnosis, expected course, and care of individuals with COVID-19 in long-term care settings. Information should be shared in a transparent and comprehensive manner to allay the increased anxiety that families may feel during this time. To achieve this, we propose an evidence-based COVID-19 Communication and Care Planning Tool that allows for an informed consent process and shared decision making between the clinician, resident, and their family.","Gaur, Swati; Pandya, Naushira; Dumyati, Ghinwa; Nace, David A; Pandya, Kaylesh; Jump, Robin L P",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,247

The host genetic background influence on the susceptibility and outcome of multiples infectious diseases has been previously reported. Herein, we aimed to describe relevant identified genetic variants and those potentially related to the inter-individual variability of COVID-19 susceptibility and/or severity considering the physiopathological pathway of the disease The HLA-A*25:01, -B*15:27, -B*46:01, -C*01:02, and -C*07:29 alleles have been associated with COVID-19 susceptibility; while HLA-A*02:02, -B*15:03, and -C*12:03 have been identified as low-risk alleles. Variants in cytokine genes such as IL1B, IL1R1, IL1RN, IL6, IL17A, FCGR2A, and TNF could be related to disease susceptibility and cytokine storm, and/or COVID-19 complications (e.g., venous thrombosis). Several variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 affecting the expression of the receptors related to COVID-19 have been associated with the disease susceptibility and risk factors. Finally, two GWAS have identified the loci 3p21.31 (LZTFL1, SLC6A20, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, and XCR1) and 9q34.2 (ABO) with COVID-19 severity.

The pandemic is currently underway, and to date has caused approximately 2.42 million deaths worldwide. The first vaccines have recently been licensed; however, research continues to identify therapeutic agents to prevent serious complications, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticoagulant or antiviral agents authorized for other therapeutic indications. Epidemiological evidence shows that advanced age and comorbidities, such as diabetes, heart disease, and dyslipidemia may represent COVID-19 risk factors. In particular, in patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with statins, it is recommended that treatment should not be discontinued if COVID-19 infection occurs. The pleiotropic effects of statins are well known. In this brief review, we propose that the use of statins can potentially protect against SARS-CoV-2-induced tissue damage and improve lung function in COVID-19 patients through several pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects of statins that may be a significant benefit in patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with statins and COVID-19 positive.

G6PD deficiency may especially predispose to hemolysis upon coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection when employing pro-oxidant therapy. However, glutathione depletion is reversible by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration. We describe a severe case of COVID-19 infection in a G6PD-deficient patient treated with hydroxychloroquine who benefited from intravenous (IV) NAC beyond reversal of hemolysis. NAC blocked hemolysis and elevation of liver enzymes, C-reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin and allowed removal from respirator and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenator and full recovery of the G6PD-deficient patient. NAC was also administered to 9 additional respirator-dependent COVID-19-infected patients without G6PD deficiency. NAC elicited clinical improvement and markedly reduced CRP in all patients and ferritin in 9/10 patients. NAC mechanism of action may involve the blockade of viral infection and the ensuing cytokine storm that warrant follow-up confirmatory studies in the setting of controlled clinical trials.","Ibrahim, Homam; Perl, Andras; Smith, Deane; Lewis, Tyler; Kon, Zachary; Goldenberg, Ronald; Yarta, Kinan; Staniloae, Cezar; Williams, Mathew",Clin Immunol,,247

Many allocation schemes face the question of whether to consider age. We offer two underdiscussed arguments for prioritising younger patients in allocation policies, which are grounded in prudence and fairness rather than purely in maximising benefits: prioritising one's younger self for lifesaving treatments is prudent from an individual perspective, and prioritising younger patients works to narrow health disparities by giving priority to patients at risk of dying earlier in life, who are more likely to be subject to systemic disadvantage. We then identify some confusions in recent arguments against considering age.","Persad, Govind; Joffe, Steven",J. med. ethics,,247

Ukraine responded to the Covid-19 pandemic with a comprehensive lockdown in late March 2020. Objectives: We conducted a phone survey among 123 OPWH with substance use disorders (SUD) in Kyiv in May 2020 to learn if these older adults may continue HIV and SUD therapy while coping with the Covid-19 pandemic. Results: Data from the survey demonstrated that while OPWH with SUD maintained HIV and SUD therapy throughout Covid-19 lockdown, social support is critical to avoiding treatment interruption for OPWH with SUD. Conclusions/Importance: During reopening, reduction of support may lead to OPWH feeling even more isolated. Post-Covid-19 pharmacological approaches to SUD treatment without social support are like vehicles without gas. The research agenda for OPWH patients with SUD going forward must include determining the type of telehealth support that will be optimally effective to retain OPWH including people who inject drugs (PWID), provision of support by lay health workers, and cost-effectiveness of such interventions. The lessons learned may be relevant to other countries as well.","Rozanova, Julia; Shenoi, Sheela; Zaviryukha, Irina; Zeziulin, Oleksandr; Kiriazova, Tetiana; Rich, Katherine; Mamedova, Elmira; Yariy, Volodymyr",Subst Use Misuse,,247

People's views about the virus impact public health efforts to mitigate the pandemic. In this study, we measured misconceptions toward coronavirus in the Jordanian population; 2,544 participants from the Jordanian population completed an online survey. Questions in the survey addressed misconceptions divided into four categories: optimism bias, pessimism bias, magical beliefs, and conspiracy theory beliefs. Questions were evaluated on a Likert scale, and average/median scores for each category were evaluated (""one"" high misconception to ""five"" low misconception). Overall, the most common misconceptions involved conspiracy theory beliefs (2.68 ± 0.83), whereas the least common involved magical beliefs (2.25 ± 0.75). Females had more misconceptions than males (2.52 versus 2.47, P = 0.04). Participants who had attended a lecture on coronavirus, had a higher level of education, worked in a medical field, lived in urban area, or resided in Amman or northern Jordan had fewer misconceptions about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 (2.64, 2.34, 2.33, 2.50 and 2.50 versus 2.53, 2.73, 2.72, 2.64, and 2.66, respectively, P < 0.001). The use of social media appeared to be an important factor influencing the likelihood of false beliefs (2.61 versus 2.38, P < 0.001). Understanding of the factors influencing public perceptions surrounding the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic will help public health authorities improve public understanding and compliance with public health recommendations directed at combatting the virus, including the use of surgical masks, thorough handwashing, and avoiding close contact.

METHODS: Fifteen participants were recruited from COVID-19 testing tents in the Capital Region of Denmark in March and April 2020. A phenomenological-hermeneutic approach inspired by Ricoeur's theory of interpretation was used. RESULTS: The analysis revealed five themes. (1) The participants' experiences of awaiting a COVID-19 test result illuminated concerns related to infecting others rather than their own health. Experiences of guilt for not taking all possible precautions to avoid the spread of COVID-19 were described and thoughts of potentially having exposed others bothered the participants. (2) The test result would guide their precautions and therefore regulate behaviour at home and in society. (3) Even though the participants did not take all possible precautions they made some changes in their everyday lives. (4) Leaving the individual with the responsibility for taking precautions based on their subjective experiences created feelings of insecurity and uncertainty. (5) Being met by health professionals was an experience that meant for the particpants that behaviour towards limiting the infection became very clear. The seriousness experienced around the test situation facilitated this attitude and behaviour in the participants. Conclusion: This study illuminated how testing for COVID-19 regulates behavior in the general population. The testing was both important for the individual's cautious behavior towards other people, work and in getting around in society but also a way to regulate behavior from a societal perspective to quicken suppression and avoid transmission of COVID-19.","Christensen, Signe Westh; Dagyaran, Ilkay; Bernild, Camilla; Missel, Malene; Berg, Selina Kikkenborg",Scand J Public Health,,247

Despite this extensive clinical experience, novel applications, including use in autoimmune disorders, infectious disease, and cancer, have only recently been identified. While short term use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is safe at traditional therapeutic doses in patients without predisposing conditions, administration of higher doses and for longer durations are associated with toxicity, including retinotoxicity. Additional liabilities of these medications include pharmacokinetic profiles that require extended dosing to achieve therapeutic tissue concentrations. To improve chloroquine therapy, researchers have turned toward nanomedicine reformulation of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to increase exposure of target tissues relative to off-target tissues, thereby improving the therapeutic index. This review highlights these reformulation efforts to date, identifying issues in experimental designs leading to ambiguity regarding the nanoformulation improvements and lack of thorough pharmacokinetics and safety evaluation. Gaps in our current understanding of these formulations, as well as recommendations for future formulation efforts, are presented.","Stevens, David M; Crist, Rachael M; Stern, Stephan T",Molecules (Basel),,247
335319,Diagnostic value of Chest CT and Initial Real-Time RT-PCR in COVID-19 Infection,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) that emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread worldwide, with a daily increase in confirmed cases and infection-related deaths. The World Health Organization declared a pandemic on the 11th of March 2020. COVID-19 presents flu-like symptoms that become severe in high-risk medically compromised subjects. The aim of this study was to perform an updated overview of the treatments and adjuvant protocols for COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature search of databases was performed (MEDLINE PubMed, Google Scholar, UpToDate, Embase, and Web of Science) using the keywords: ""COVID-19"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""coronavirus"" and ""SARS-CoV-2"" (date range: 1 January 2019 to 31st October 2020), focused on clinical features and treatments. RESULTS: The main treatments retrieved were antivirals, antimalarials, convalescent plasma, immunomodulators, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and mesenchymal stem cells. Most of the described treatments may provide benefits to COVID-19 subjects, but no one protocol has definitively proven its efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: While many efforts are being spent worldwide in research aimed at identifying early diagnostic methods and evidence-based effective treatments, mass vaccination is thought to be the best option against this disease in the near future.","Inchingolo, A.

335688,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders,2020,"BACKGROUND: In order to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV­2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2) the federal states and the government in Germany have implemented protective measures with far-reaching consequences for the population and the economy. Amongst others, these measures include the temporary restriction of the operation of leisure facilities as well as contact and travel restrictions. These government regulations and recommendations have provoked mixed reactions, with some parts of the population not complying accordingly. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study is to explore reasons for the noncompliance with protective measures on the basis of social media posts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three social networks (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube comments) were systematically investigated for the period 2 March to 18 April 2020 with regard to attitudes and beliefs about ""social distancing"" and other protective measures by means of qualitative document and content analysis. A total of 119 postings were included in the analysis and interpreted. RESULTS: Six main categories and four subcategories were identified in terms of the rejection of protective measures: misinformation of social media (trivialization and doubts about the effectiveness of protective measures), mistrust of the established public media, knowledge deficits and uncertainty, restriction of basic rights, the role of authorities (population control and poor trust in the Robert Koch Institute), and economic consequences of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Misinformation in social media and knowledge deficits may contribute to underestimating the pandemic. In addition, economic pressures may contribute to rejecting protective measures. To increase the acceptance of implemented protective measures, health education and transparent and evidence-based communication represent relevant determinants.","Wahidie, Diana; Yilmaz-Aslan, Yüce; Ölcer, Sabahat; Aksakal, Tugba; Brzoska, Patrick",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,247

Countries around the world introduced severe social restrictions, and significant changes to health service provision in the first wave of the pandemic to suppress the spread of the virus and prioritize healthcare for those who contracted it. This study interviewed 48 hospital doctors who worked in Ireland during the first wave of the pandemic and investigated their conceptualizations of their own well-being during that time (March-May 2020). Doctors were interviewed via Zoom&#8482; or telephone. Interview transcripts were analyzed using structured thematic analysis. Five composite narratives are presented which have been crafted to illustrate themes and experiences emerging from the data. This study found that despite the risks of contracting COVID-19, many doctors saw some improvements to their physical well-being in the first wave of the pandemic. However, most also experienced a decline in their mental well-being due to anxiety, emotional exhaustion, guilt, isolation and poor support. These findings shed light on doctor well-being during COVID-19, and the ways in which they have been affected by the pandemic, both professionally and personally. The paper concludes by highlighting how doctors' work life and well-being can be better supported during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Creese, Jennifer; Byrne, John-Paul; Conway, Edel; Barrett, Elizabeth; Prihodova, Lucia; Humphries, Niamh",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,247

337960,COVID-19 Outbreak: Neurological Manifestations beyond Cough and Fever,2020,"BACKGROUND: On March 9, 2020, the first COVID-19 case was reported in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, in the northwestern part of India. Understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a local level is becoming increasingly important to guide measures to control the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the serial interval and basic reproduction number (R0) to understand the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak at a district level. We used standard mathematical modeling approaches to assess the utility of these factors in determining the effectiveness of COVID-19 responses and projecting the size of the epidemic. METHODS: Contact tracing of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 was performed to obtain the serial intervals. The median and 95th percentile values of the SARS-CoV-2 serial interval were obtained from the best fits with the weibull, log-normal, log-logistic, gamma, and generalized gamma distributions. Aggregate and instantaneous R0 values were derived with different methods using the EarlyR and EpiEstim packages in R software. RESULTS: The median and 95th percentile values of the serial interval were 5.23 days (95% CI 4.72-5.79) and 13.20 days (95% CI 10.90-18.18), respectively. R0 during the first 30 days of the outbreak was 1.62 (95% CI 1.07-2.17), which subsequently decreased to 1.15 (95% CI 1.09-1.21). The peak instantaneous R0 values obtained using a Poisson process developed by Jombert et al were 6.53 (95% CI 2.12-13.38) and 3.43 (95% CI 1.71-5.74) for sliding time windows of 7 and 14 days, respectively. The peak R0 values obtained using the method by Wallinga and Teunis were 2.96 (95% CI 2.52-3.36) and 2.92 (95% CI 2.65-3.22) for sliding time windows of 7 and 14 days, respectively. R0 values of 1.21 (95% CI 1.09-1.34) and 1.12 (95% CI 1.03-1.21) for the 7- and 14-day sliding time windows, respectively, were obtained on July 6, 2020, using method by Jombert et al. Using the method by Wallinga and Teunis, values of 0.32 (95% CI 0.27-0.36) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.58-0.63) were obtained for the 7- and 14-day sliding time windows, respectively. The projection of cases over the next month was 2131 (95% CI 1799-2462). Reductions of transmission by 25% and 50% corresponding to reasonable and aggressive control measures could lead to 58.7% and 84.0% reductions in epidemic size, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The projected transmission reductions indicate that strengthening control measures could lead to proportionate reductions of the size of the COVID-19 epidemic. Time-dependent instantaneous R0 estimation based on the process by Jombart et al was found to be better suited for guiding COVID-19 response at the district level than overall R0 or instantaneous R0 estimation by the Wallinga and Teunis method. A data-driven approach at the local level is proposed to be useful in guiding public health strategy and surge capacity planning.","Saurabh, Suman; Verma, Mahendra Kumar; Gautam, Vaishali; Kumar, Nitesh; Goel, Akhil Dhanesh; Gupta, Manoj Kumar; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Misra, Sanjeev",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,247

341305,Cytokine profile in plasma of severe COVID-19 does not differ from ARDS and sepsis,2020,"Objective: To investigate the causes of death in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 64 patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 12, 2020 to February 28, 2020. There were 36 males and 28 females, aging from 44 to 85 years[median 68 (62, 72)]. Fifty-two patients (81%) had underlying comorbidities. The patients were divided into the death group (n=40) and the survival group (n=24) according to the treatment outcomes. In the death group, 24 were male, and 16 were female, aging from 49 to 85 years [median 69 (62, 72)], with 31 cases (78%) complicated with underlying diseases. In the survival group, there were 12 males and 12 females, aging from 44 to 82 years[median 66 (61,73)], with 21 cases (88%) with comorbidities. Clinical data of the two groups were collected and compared, including general information, laboratory examinations, imaging features and treatments. For normally distributed data, independent group t test was used; otherwise, Mann Whitney test was used to compare the variables. &#967;(2) test and Fisher exact test was used when analyzing categorical variables. Results: The median of creatine kinase isozyme (CK-MB) in the death group was 19.0 (17.0,23.0) U/L, which was higher than that in the survival group 16.5 (13.5,19.6) U/L. The median level of cTnI in the death group was 0.03 (0.03, 0.07) µg/L, which was significantly higher than that in the survival group (0.02, 0.03) µg/L, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P=0.007). The concentration of myoglobin in the death group was 79.5 (28.7, 189.0) µg/L, which was higher than 33.1 (25.7, 54.5) µg/L in the survival group. The level of D-dimer in the death group was 2.0 (0.6, 5.2) mg/L, which was higher than 0.7 (0.4, 2.0) mg/L in the survival group. The LDH level of the death group was 465.0 (337.5,606.5) U/L, which was higher than that of the survibal group, 341.0 (284.0,430.0) U/L, the difference being statistically significant (P=0.006). The concentration of alanine aminotransferase in the death group was 40.0 (30.0, 48.0) U/L, which was higher than 32.5 (24.0, 40.8) U/L in the survival group, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.047).Abnormal ECG was found in 16 cases (62%) in the death group, which was significantly higher than that in the survival group (29%), the difference being statistically significant (P=0.024) .The main causes of death were severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, n=20), acute heart failure(n=9), atrial fibrillation(n=3) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS, n=3). Conclusions: ARDS caused by severe pneumonia and acute heart failure and atrial fibrillation caused by acute viral myocarditis were the main causes of death in severe COVID-19 patients. Early prevention of myocardial injury and treatment of acute viral myocarditis complicated with disease progression may provide insights into treatment and reduction of mortality in patients with severe COVID-19.","Zhu, Q; Zhang, W; Wang, Q; Liu, J H; Wu, C H; Luo, T; Peng, P",Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,,247

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of Brazilian civil servants participating in the fourth wave (2012-2013) of the longitudinal Pró-Saúde Study. Associations were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), estimated by multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Among 2,828 participants, 15.9% would not be willing to vaccinate in the future if the Brazilian Ministry of Health promoted a new vaccination campaign against pandemic influenza. Not willing to vaccinate in the future was strongly associated with not taking the pandemic influenza vaccine in 2010 (OR = 9.0, 95%CI 6.9 - 11.6). Among the unvaccinated, females, those aged &gt; 60 years, and non-health care workers were less willing to vaccinate in the future. Again, in the vaccinated group, females were less willing to vaccinate. Conclusion: Multidisciplinary efforts should be encouraged in order to identify reasons for refusing vaccination, focusing on the individual and group perceptions of susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers to vaccination. Such information is needed to identify target groups for the delivery of customized interventions towards preventing emerging pandemics, such as avian influenza and COVID-19.","Werneck, Guilherme Loureiro; Faerstein, Eduardo",Rev. bras. epidemiol,,247

Outpatient maintenance hemodialysis seems to entail an increased risk of contagion, and previous reports inform of increased mortality among this population. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical and laboratory parameters, outcomes, and management once discharged of CKD-5D patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from our health area. RESULTS: Out of the 429 CKD-5D population, 36 were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (8%): 34 on in-center hemodialysis and 2 on peritoneal dialysis. Five were asymptomatic. The most common symptom was fever (70%), followed by dyspnea and cough. History of cardiovascular disease and elevation of LDH and C-reactive protein during admission were associated with higher mortality. Thirteen patients died (36%), 8 patients were admitted to an ICU, and survival was low (38%) among the latter. The mean time to death was 12 days. Most discharged patients got negative rRT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs within 26 days of diagnosis. However, there is a portion of cured patients that continue to have positive results even more than 2 months after the initial presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Patients on dialysis have an increased mortality risk if infected with SARS-CoV-2. Preventive measures have proven useful. Thus, proper ones, such as universal screening of the population and isolation when required, need to be generalized. Better de-isolation criteria are necessary to ensure an appropriate use of public health resources.","Broseta, José Jesús; Rodríguez-Espinosa, Diana; Cuadrado, Elena; Guillén-Olmos, Elena; Hermida, Evelyn; Montagud-Marrahi, Enrique; Rodas, Lida; Vera, Manel; Fontseré, Néstor; Arias, Marta; Cases, Aleix; Maduell, Francisco",Blood Purif,,247

SARS-CoV-2 causes bilateral interstitial pneumonia, which can responsible of respiratory failure in the most severe cases, but the virus has also a wide range of other manifestations, including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurological, and cutaneous signs and symptoms. Cutaneous manifestations are an important matter of study for allergy specialists, as they can be specific signs of the infection, but also manifestations of adverse reactions to the medical therapy in use. In this case series, we report four different cases of dermatological manifestations in COVID patients, two in hospitalised patients and two in patients with mild disease, treated at home. The first case reported is a woman, who develops urticaria while being treated at home with mild COVID-infection; the second and the third one case reported are drug- hypersensivity reaction to remdesevir and low molecular weight heparin.

Due to the frequent hospitalizations, HF places a major burden on the available hospital and healthcare resources. In the future, HF care should not only be organized solely at the clinical ward and outpatient clinics, but remote monitoring strategies are urgently needed to guide, monitor, and treat chronic HF patients remotely from their homes as well. The intuitiveness and relatively low costs of non-invasive remote monitoring tools make them an appealing and emerging concept for developing new medical apps and devices. The recent COVID-19 pandemic and the associated transition of patient care outside the hospital will boost the development of remote monitoring tools, and many strategies will be reinvented with modern tools. However, it is important to look carefully at the inconsistencies that have been reported in non-invasive remote monitoring effectiveness. With this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of the available evidence on non-invasive remote monitoring in chronic HF patients and provide future perspectives that may significantly benefit the broader group of HF patients.","Veenis, Jesse F; Radhoe, Sumant P; Hooijmans, Petra; Brugts, Jasper J",Sensors (Basel),,247
346041,Association between the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic and ABO blood type distribution,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, with acute respiratory failure as the most significant symptom, has led to a global pandemic. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is considered as the most important receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and wildly expressed in human tissues. Whereas, the extremely low expression of ACE2 in lung could hardly interpret the severe symptom of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Here we profiled two SARS-CoV-2 infection related genes, the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), in human tissues and organs. Consistent with the expression and distribution of ACE2, TMPRSS2 was also highly expressed in digestive, urinary and reproductive systems, but low expressed in lung. Notably, the anti-virus protein IFITM3 also expressed much lower in lung than other tissues, which might be related to the severe lung symptoms of COVID-19. In addition, the low expression of IFITM3 in immune cells suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might attack lymphocytes and induce the cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Furthermore, cancer patients were considered as more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data supposed that fourteen types of tumors might have different susceptibility to the virus according to ACE2, TMPRSS2 and IFITM3 expression patterns. Interestingly the prognosis of six types of cancers including breast carcinoma (BRCA), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), and hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) were closely related to these gene expressions. Our study explored the expression and distribution profiles of two potential novel molecules that might participate in SARS-CoV-2 infection and involved in immunity, which may provide a functional basis for preventing infection of SARS-CoV-2.","Dai, Yu-Jun; Zhang, Wei-Na; Wang, Wei-Da; He, Si-Yuan; Liang, Cheng-Cai; Wang, Da-Wei",Int J Biol Sci,,247

We sought to identify risk factors for influenza-related hospitalization, specifically the role of immunization and oseltamivir prescriptions. METHODS: Patients with influenza diagnoses were identified from the MarketScan database (2014-2018). Primary risk factors of interest were an influenza vaccination within 6 months prior to infection and oseltamivir prescriptions (filled on the day diagnosis, the following day, or 2-5 days). A multivariable logistic regression model was run to identify risk factors for influenza-related hospitalizations within 30 days of diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 2 395 498 influenza infections, 0.27% were hospitalized. Of those prescribed oseltamivir the day of diagnosis, 0.13% were later hospitalized, compared to 0.67% among those who filled prescriptions the following day and 11.8% when filled within 2 to 5 days. Upon adjustment, oseltamivir prescriptions filled on the day of diagnosis were associated with significantly decreased odds of hospitalization (OR 0.51 CI 0.48-0.55). Prescriptions filled within 1 to 5 days of diagnosis were associated with significantly increased odds of hospitalization (1 day OR 2.01 CI 1.81-2.24; 2-5 days OR 34.1 CI 31.7-36.6). Flu vaccination was associated with a lower odds for hospitalization (OR 0.84 CI 0.74-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: We recommend oseltamivir be prescribed to patients when they first present with influenza-like symptoms to reduce the burden on the healthcare system. We also identified reduced odds of hospitalization associated with influenza vaccination, which is already well established, but particularly important this coming flu season.","Athanassoglou, Vassilis; Wilson, Lauren A; Liu, Jiabin; Poeran, Jashvant; Zhong, Haoyan; Memtsoudis, Stavros G",J Prim Care Community Health,,247

347021,Universal checklist for COVID-19 control measures: consensus via a Delphi method,2021,"The rapid and accurate testing of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still crucial to mitigate, and eventually halt, the spread of this disease. Currently, nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and oropharyngeal swab (OPS) are the recommended standard sampling techniques, yet, these have some limitations such as the complexity of collection. Hence, several other types of specimens that are easier to obtain are being tested as alternatives to nasal/throat swabs in nucleic acid assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This study aims to critically appraise and compare the clinical performance of RT-PCR tests using oral saliva, deep-throat saliva/posterior oropharyngeal saliva (DTS/POS), sputum, urine, feces, and tears/conjunctival swab (CS) against standard specimens (NPS, OPS, or a combination of both). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrial.gov and NIPH Clinical Trial) were searched up to the 30th of December, 2020. Case-control and cohort studies on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 were included. The methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS 2). We identified 1560 entries, 33 of which (1.1%) met all required criteria and were included for the quantitative data analysis. Saliva presented the higher accuracy, 92.1% (95% CI: 70.0-98.3), with an estimated sensitivity of 83.9% (95% CI: 77.4-88.8) and specificity of 96.4% (95% CI: 89.5-98.8). DTS/POS samples had an overall accuracy of 79.7% (95% CI: 43.3-95.3), with an estimated sensitivity of 90.1% (95% CI: 83.3-96.9) and specificity of 63.1% (95% CI: 36.8-89.3). The remaining index specimens could not be adequately assessed given the lack of studies available. Our meta-analysis shows that saliva samples from the oral region provide a high sensitivity and specificity; therefore, these appear to be the best candidates for alternative specimens to NPS/OPS in SARS-CoV-2 detection, with suitable protocols for swab-free sample collection to be determined and validated in the future. The distinction between oral and extra-oral salivary samples will be crucial, since DTS/POS samples may induce a higher rate of false positives. Urine, feces, tears/CS and sputum seem unreliable for diagnosis. Saliva testing may increase testing capacity, ultimately promoting the implementation of truly deployable COVID-19 tests, which could either work at the point-of-care (e.g. hospitals, clinics) or at outbreak control spots (e.g., schools, airports, and nursing homes).","Moreira, Vânia M; Mascarenhas, Paulo; Machado, Vanessa; Botelho, João; Mendes, José João; Taveira, Nuno; Almeida, M Gabriela",Diagnostics (Basel),,247

Two researchers independently screened and evaluated the obtained studies and extracted the outcome indexes. Revman 5.3 software will be used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: The outbreak is continuing, and we need to be prepared for a long fight. If masks are effective, we need to promote their use as soon as possible. If masks are ineffective, strong evidence should be given. This is an urgent task and our team will finish it as soon as possible. CONCLUSION: Provide stronger evidence to solve the problem, should we wear masks or not right now.","Wang, Hua; Chen, Mao-Bing; Cui, Wei-Yan; Xu, Hua-Lan; Zheng, Qi-Han",Medicine (Baltimore),,247
347793,Decision-Making in COVID-19 and Frailty,2020,"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate whether outpatient insulin treatment, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), glucose on admission, or glycemic control during hospitalization is associated with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) illness severity or mortality in hospitalized patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) in a geographical region with low COVID-19 prevalence. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 1 through August 31, 2020 to evaluate whether outpatient insulin use, HbA1c, glucose on admission, or average glucose during admission was associated with intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation (ventilator) requirement, or mortality. RESULTS: Among 111 patients with DM, 48 (43.2%) were on outpatient insulin and the average HbA1c was 8.1% (65 mmol/mol). The average glucose on admission was 187.0±102.94 mg/dL and the average glucose during hospitalization was 173.4±39.8 mg/dL. Use of outpatient insulin, level of HbA1c, glucose on admission, or average glucose during hospitalization was not associated with ICU admission, ventilator requirement, or mortality among patients with COVID-19 and DM. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in a region with relatively low COVID-19 prevalence suggest that neither outpatient glycemic control, glucose on admission, or inpatient glycemic control is predictive of illness severity or mortality in patients with DM hospitalized with COVID-19.","Mehta, Paras B; Kohn, Michael A; Koliwad, Suneil K; Rushakoff, Robert J",,,247

Mean maximum observed concentration and area under the concentration versus time curve increased in a dose-proportional manner, and there was no accumulation following multiple doses. When administered in a fed state, there was a decrease in the rate of absorption, but no decrease in overall exposure.Molnupiravir was well tolerated. Fewer than half of subjects reported an adverse event, the incidence of adverse events was higher following administration of placebo, and 93.3% of adverse events were mild. One discontinued early due to rash. There were no serious adverse events and there were no clinically significant findings in clinical laboratory, vital signs, or electrocardiography. Plasma exposures exceeded expected efficacious doses based on scaling from animal models; therefore, dose escalations were discontinued before a maximum tolerated dose was reached.","Painter, Wendy P; Holman, Wayne; Bush, Jim A; Almazedi, Firas; Malik, Hamzah; Eraut, Nicola C J E; Morin, Merribeth J; Szewczyk, Laura J; Painter, George R",,,247

This study aimed to confirm whether anosmia and dysgeusia are specific symptoms among those who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We conducted an age-matched case-control study in the Eastern Townships region of Quebec between Mar. 10 and Mar. 23, 2020. We included adults (age &#8805; 18 yr) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cases were matched (1:1) according to 5-year age groups with control patents selected randomly from among all patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 during the same period. Demographic and laboratory information was collected from medical records. Clinical symptoms and comorbidities associated with anosmia and dysgeusia were obtained by telephone interview with a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Among 2883 people tested for SARS-CoV-2, we identified 134 positive cases (70 women [52.2%] and 64 men [47.8%]; median age 57.1 [interquartile range 41.2-64.5] yr). The symptoms independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in conditional logistic regression were anosmia or dysgeusia or both (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 62.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.0-359.7), presence of myalgia (adjusted OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.9-29.9), blurred vision (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0-0.8) and chest pain (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0-0.6). INTERPRETATION: We found a strong association between olfactory and gustatory symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. These symptoms should be considered as common and distinctive features of SARS-CoV-2 infection and should serve as an indication for testing and possible retesting of people whose first test result is negative.","Carignan, Alex; Valiquette, Louis; Grenier, Cynthia; Musonera, Jean Berchmans; Nkengurutse, Delphin; Marcil-Héguy, Anaïs; Vettese, Kim; Marcoux, Dominique; Valiquette, Corinne; Xiong, Wei Ting; Fortier, Pierre-Hughes; Généreux, Mélissa; Pépin, Jacques",CMAJ,,247

350567,Agminated melanocytic nevi as a rare variant of melanocytic nevus: Report of two cases,2020,"BACKGROUND: High-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) deliver high flows of blended humidified air and oxygen via wide-bore nasal cannulae and may be useful in providing respiratory support for adults experiencing acute respiratory failure, or at risk of acute respiratory failure, in the intensive care unit (ICU). This is an update of an earlier version of the review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of HFNC compared to standard oxygen therapy, or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), for respiratory support in adults in the ICU. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane COVID-19 Register (17 April 2020), clinical trial registers (6 April 2020) and conducted forward and backward citation searches. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled studies (RCTs) with a parallel-group or cross-over design comparing HFNC use versus other types of non-invasive respiratory support (standard oxygen therapy via nasal cannulae or mask; or NIV or NIPPV which included continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure) in adults admitted to the ICU. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included 31 studies (22 parallel-group and nine cross-over designs) with 5136 participants; this update included 20 new studies. Twenty-one studies compared HFNC with standard oxygen therapy, and 13 compared HFNC with NIV or NIPPV; three studies included both comparisons. We found 51 ongoing studies (estimated 12,807 participants), and 19 studies awaiting classification for which we could not ascertain study eligibility information. In 18 studies, treatment was initiated after extubation. In the remaining studies, participants were not previously mechanically ventilated. HFNC versus standard oxygen therapy HFNC may lead to less treatment failure as indicated by escalation to alternative types of oxygen therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.86; 15 studies, 3044 participants; low-certainty evidence). HFNC probably makes little or no difference in mortality when compared with standard oxygen therapy (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.11; 11 studies, 2673 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). HFNC probably results in little or no difference to cases of pneumonia (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.09; 4 studies, 1057 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and we were uncertain of its effect on nasal mucosa or skin trauma (RR 3.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 31.48; 2 studies, 617 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We found low-certainty evidence that HFNC may make little or no difference to the length of ICU stay according to the type of respiratory support used (MD 0.12 days, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.27; 7 studies, 1014 participants). We are uncertain whether HFNC made any difference to the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) within 24 hours of treatment (MD 10.34 mmHg, 95% CI -17.31 to 38; 5 studies, 600 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether HFNC made any difference to short-term comfort (MD 0.31, 95% CI -0.60 to 1.22; 4 studies, 662 participants, very low-certainty evidence), or to long-term comfort (MD 0.59, 95% CI -2.29 to 3.47; 2 studies, 445 participants, very low-certainty evidence). HFNC versus NIV or NIPPV We found no evidence of a difference between groups in treatment failure when HFNC were used post-extubation or without prior use of mechanical ventilation (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.22; 5 studies, 1758 participants; low-certainty evidence), or in-hospital mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.31; 5 studies, 1758 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of using HFNC on incidence of pneumonia (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.52; 3 studies, 1750 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and HFNC may result in little or no difference to barotrauma (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.14; 1 study, 830 participants; low-certainty evidence). HFNC may make little or no difference to the length of ICU stay (MD -0.72 days, 95% CI -2.85 to 1.42; 2 studies, 246 participants; low-certainty evidence). The ratio of PaO2/FiO2 may be lower up to 24 hours with HFNC use (MD -58.10 mmHg, 95% CI -71.68 to -44.51; 3 studies, 1086 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether HFNC improved short-term comfort when measured using comfort scores (MD 1.33, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.92; 2 studies, 258 participants) and responses to questionnaires (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.53; 1 study, 168 participants); evidence for short-term comfort was very low certainty. No studies reported on nasal mucosa or skin trauma. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HFNC may lead to less treatment failure when compared to standard oxygen therapy, but probably makes little or no difference to treatment failure when compared to NIV or NIPPV. For most other review outcomes, we found no evidence of a difference in effect. However, the evidence was often of low or very low certainty. We found a large number of ongoing studies; including these in future updates could increase the certainty or may alter the direction of these effects.","Lewis, Sharon R; Baker, Philip E; Parker, Roses; Smith, Andrew F",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,247
351074,Multi-Omics Resolves a Sharp Disease-State Shift between Mild and Moderate COVID-19,2020,"Introduction: Coccidioides immitis and posadasii are dimorphic fungi endemic to the southwestern United States. Most immunocompetent hosts who contract coccidioidomycosis will clear the infection without symptoms. We detail the case of an immunocompetent, 56-year-old female who presented with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection and concern for COVID-19 infection given significant exposure history. Case Description: The patient was referred to our advanced lung disease center (located in the southwestern United States) for subacute, productive cough associated with clear-yellow phlegm, dyspnea on exertion, infrequent night sweats, and abnormal chest x-ray (Figure A). The patient denied any history of fever, chills, hemoptysis, unintentional weight loss, or chest pain. Six-weeks prior to admission, the patient had significant exposure to multiple symptomatic persons with COVID-19. Two RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 to date were ruled negative, and a third test performed on admission was also negative. Computed tomography of the chest revealed right upper lobe cavitary consolidation with surrounding nodules bilaterally (Figure B). Sputum smear was negative for acid-fast bacillus or other bacterial organisms, prompting a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. Results demonstrated fungal cultures of Coccidioides immitis/posadasii. The patient also had significant IgG antibodies against Coccidioides species. She was started on therapeutic doses of fluconazole with a gradual improvement in symptoms. Discussion: History of significant exposure to COVID-19 warrants prompt and thorough investigation for disease status. Nonetheless, clinicians should still maintain a high suspicion and vigilance for excluding other, potentially treatable infectious etiologies, even regional endemic fungal infections that tend to manifest without symptoms.","Arjuna, A.; Olson, M.

Method: We searched PUBMED for articles listed using the search terms ""COVID 19 Pandemic"", COVID19 and genes,"" ""stress and COVID 19"", Stress and Social distancing: Results: Long-term social distancing may be neurologically harmful, the consequence of epigenetic insults to the gene encoding the primary receptor for SARS-CoV2, and COVID 19. The gene is Angiotensin I Converting-Enzyme 2 (ACE2). According to the multi-experiment matrix (MEM), the gene exhibiting the most statistically significant co-expression link to ACE2 is Dopa Decarboxylase (DDC). DDC is a crucial enzyme that participates in the synthesis of both dopamine and serotonin. SARS-CoV2-induced downregulation of ACE2 expression might reduce dopamine and serotonin synthesis, causing hypodopaminergia. Discussion: Indeed, added to the known reduced dopamine function during periods of stress, including social distancing the consequence being both genetic and epigenetic vulnerability to all Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) addictive behaviors. Stress seen in PTSD can generate downstream alterations in immune functions by reducing methylation levels of immune-related genes. Conclusion: Mitigation of these effects by identifying subjects at risk and promoting dopaminergic homeostasis to help regulate stress-relative hypodopaminergia, attenuate fears, and prevent subsequent unwanted drug and non-drug RDS type addictive behaviors seems prudent.","Blum, Kenneth; Cadet, Jean Lud; Baron, David; Badgaiyan, Rajendra D; Brewer, Raymond; Modestino, Edward J; Gold, Mark S",Subst Use Misuse,,247

The first generation of BTK inhibitor, Ibrutinib, achieved remarkable progress in the treatment of B-cell malignancies, but still has problems with drug-resistance or off-target induced serious side effects. Therefore, numerous new BTK inhibitors were developed to address this unmet medical need. In parallel, the effect of BTK inhibitors against immune-related diseases has been evaluated in clinical trials. This review summarizes recent progress in the research and development of BTK inhibitors, with a focus on structural characteristics and structure-activity relationships. The structure-refinement process of representative pharmacophores as well as their effects on binding affinity, biological activity and pharmacokinetics profiles were analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of reversible/irreversible BTK inhibitors and their potential implications were discussed to provide a reference for the rational design and development of novel potent BTK inhibitors.","Liu, Jiakuo; Chen, Chengjuan; Wang, Dongmei; Zhang, Jie; Zhang, Tiantai",Eur J Med Chem,,247

Motivated by the urgent need to improve timely diagnosis of life-threatening heart conditions, especially aortic stenosis, we develop a benchmark dataset to assess semi-supervised approaches to two tasks relevant to cardiac ultrasound (echocardiogram) interpretation: view classification and disease severity classification. We find that a state-of-the-art method called MixMatch achieves promising gains in heldout accuracy on both tasks, learning from a large volume of truly unlabeled images as well as a labeled set collected at great expense to achieve better performance than is possible with the labeled set alone. We further pursue patient-level diagnosis prediction, which requires aggregating across hundreds of images of diverse view types, most of which are irrelevant, to make a coherent prediction. The best patient-level performance is achieved by new methods that prioritize diagnosis predictions from images that are predicted to be clinically-relevant views and transfer knowledge from the view task to the diagnosis task. We hope our released Tufts Medical Echocardiogram Dataset and evaluation framework inspire further improvements in multi-task semi-supervised learning for clinical applications.","Huang, Zhe; Long, Gary; Wessler, Benjamin; Hughes, Michael C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00080v1.pdf,247
353086,COVID-19 as a Rare Cause of Facial Nerve Neuritis in a Pediatric Patient,2021,"PURPOSE: This report compares COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates in the nonmetropolitan areas of the United States with the metropolitan areas across three 11-week periods from March 1 to October 18, 2020. METHODS: County-level COVID-19 case, death, and population counts were downloaded from USAFacts.org. The 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme was collapsed into two categories called metropolitan (large central, large fringe, medium, and small metropolitans) and nonmetropolitan (micropolitan/noncore). Daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates were computed to show temporal trends for each of these two categories. Maps showing the ratio of nonmetropolitan to metropolitan COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates by state identify states with higher rates in nonmetropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas in each of the three 11-week periods. FINDINGS: In the period between March 1 and October 18, 2020, 13.8% of the 8,085,214 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10.7% of the 217,510 deaths occurred among people residing in nonmetropolitan counties. The nonmetropolitan incidence and mortality trends steadily increased and surpassed those in metropolitan areas, beginning in early August.

Using the Donabedian model as a guide, both structure and process changes were implemented to maintain high-quality clinical outcomes as well as ED staff safety and engagement. Rapid changes to the model of care, both architecturally and through the expansion of universal precautions through personal protective equipment, created the foundation for what was to follow. Clinical, service quality, and staff safety outcomes were evaluated to demonstrate that the collaborative changes that follow a known process improvement model can be used to address the coronavirus disease pandemic. Further study is needed to compare the outcomes of this facility-level case study with those of others to evaluate the success of the measures outlined.","Binder, Cairenn; Torres, Rafael E; Elwell, Diana",,,247

357141,Innovation in the design of large-scale hybrid randomized clinical trials,2020,"The impacts of COVID-19 reach far beyond the hundreds of lives lost to the disease; in particular, the pre-existing learning crisis is expected to be magnified during school shutdown. Despite efforts to put distance learning strategies in place, the threat of student dropouts, especially among adolescents, looms as a major concern. Are interventions to motivate adolescents to stay in school effective amidst the pandemic? Here we show that, in Brazil, nudges via text messages to high-school students, to motivate them to stay engaged with school activities, substantially reduced dropouts during school shutdown, and greatly increased their motivation to go back to school when classes resume. While such nudges had been shown to decrease dropouts during normal times, it is surprising that those impacts replicate in the absence of regular classes because their effects are typically mediated by teachers (whose effort in the classroom changes in response to the nudges). Results show that insights from the science of adolescent psychology can be leveraged to shift developmental trajectories at a critical juncture. They also qualify those insights: effects increase with exposure and gradually fade out once communication stops, providing novel evidence that motivational interventions work by redirecting adolescents' attention.","Lichand, Guilherme; Christen, Julien",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04767v1.pdf,247

Sources of information: Program-specific documents, pre-existing, and related to COVID-19; documents from national and international kidney agencies; national and international webinars, including webinars that we hosted for input and feedback; with additional information from formal and informal review of published academic literature. Methods: Members of the Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) Board of Directors solicited a team of clinicians and administrators with expertise in home dialysis. Specific COVID-19-related themes in home dialysis were determined by the Canadian senior renal leaders community of practice, a group compromising medical and administrative leaders of provincial and health authority renal programs. We then developed consensus-based recommendations virtually by the CSN work-group with input from ethicists with nephrology training. The recommendations were further reviewed by community nephrologists and over a CSN-sponsored webinar, attended by 225 kidney health care professionals, for further peer input. The final consensus recommendations also incorporated review by the editors at the Canadian Journal of Kidney Health and Disease (CJKHD). Key findings: We identified 7 broad areas of home dialysis practice management that may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) peritoneal dialysis catheter placement, (2) home dialysis training, (3) home dialysis management, (4) personal protective equipment, (5) product delivery, (6) minimizing direct health care provider and patient contact, and (7) assisted peritoneal dialysis in the community. We make specific suggestions and recommendations for each of these areas. Limitations: This suggestions and recommendations in this paper are expert opinion, and subject to the biases associated with this level of evidence. To expedite the publication of this work, a parallel review process was created that may not be as robust as standard arms’ length peer-review processes. Implications: These recommendations are intended to provide the best care possible during a time of altered priorities and reduced resources.","Copland, Michael; Hemmett, Juliya; MacRae, Jennifer M.; McCormick, Brendan; McCormick, Michael; Qirjazi, Elena; Singh, Rajinder S.; Zimmerman, Deborah; Antonsen, John; Banks, Cheryl; Clark, David; Clark, Edward; Davison, Sara N.; Goldberg, Aviva; Hiremath, Swapnil; Kappel, Joanne; Mac-Way, Fabrice; Mathew, Anna; Moist, Louise; Moran, Sarah; Pandeya, Sanjay; Ryz, Krista; Singh, Suneet; Soroka, Steven; Suri, Rita; Tennankore, Karthik; Thanabalasingam, Susan; Wald, Ron; Weir, Matthew; White, Christine; Levin, Adeera; Mustafa, Reem A.; Nesrallah, Gihad",Can.

Reviewing the United States Environmental Protection Agency Lead and Copper rule data can contribute to guiding future legislation on Pb testing. This work aims to (i) identify variations in Pb levels in North Carolina school and child care drinking water by building age, (ii) evaluate the effect of corrosion control measures on reducing these levels, and (iii) evaluate the adequacy of Pb reporting limits according to modern instrumentation. To achieve these objectives, information on 26,608 water samples collected in 206 North Carolina child centers between 1991 and 2019 has been analyzed. Lead concentrations were above a recently proposed 5 µg/L trigger level in 12.3%, 10.4%, 7.5%, and 0.9% of samples from pre-1987, 1987-1990, 1991-2013, and post-2013 buildings, respectively. Thus, recently proposed legislation requiring testing only for pre-1987 (or pre-1991) buildings will fail to identify all centers at risk. The odds that a greater than 5 µg/L Pb level is detected has been decreasing over the years, with a faster decreasing rate for buildings reporting corrosion control. Over 15% of samples report a method detection limit of 5 µg/L. For accurate results, future legislation should require sub-µg/L detection limits, which are easily achievable with commonly available instrumentation.","Carter, Jake A; Erhardt, Robert J; Jones, Bradley T; Donati, George L",Environ Sci Technol,,247

Sacco Hospital (Milano, Italy) on 20th February 2020 in a 38 years old male patient, who was found positive for pneumonia at the Codogno Hospital. Thereafter Lombardy has reported the highest prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the country, especially in Milano, Brescia and Bergamo provinces. The aim of this study was to assess the potential presence of different viral clusters belonging to the six main provinces involved in Lombardy COVID-19 cases in order to highlight peculiar province-dependent viral characteristics. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted on 20 full length genomes obtained from patients addressing to several Lombard hospitals from February 20th to April 4th, 2020, aligned with 41 Italian viral genome assemblies available on GISAID database as of 30th March, 2020: two main monophyletic clades, containing 8 and 53 isolates, respectively, were identified. Noteworthy, Bergamo isolates mapped inside the small clade harbouring M gene D3G mutation. The molecular clock analysis estimated a cluster divergence approximately one month before the first patient identification, supporting the hypothesis that different SARS-CoV-2 strains had spread worldwide at different times, but their presence became evident only in late February along with Italian epidemic emergence. Therefore, this epidemiological reconstruction suggests that virus initial circulation in Lombardy was ascribable to multiple introduction. The phylogenetic reconstruction robustness, however, will be improved when more genomic sequences are available, in order to guarantee a complete epidemiological surveillance.","Micheli, Valeria; Rimoldi, Sara G; Romeri, Francesca; Comandatore, Francesco; Mancon, Alessandro; Gigantiello, Anna; Perini, Matteo; Mileto, Davide; Pagani, Cristina; Lombardi, Alessandra; Gismondo, Maria R",J. med. virol,,247

359222,COVID-19 in a Young Girl with Restrictive Cardiomyopathy and Chronic Lung Disease,2020,"This paper proposes a dynamic model to describe and forecast the dynamics of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 transmission. The model is based on an approach previously used to describe the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic. This methodology is used to describe the COVID-19 dynamics in six countries where the pandemic is widely spread, namely China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the USA. For this purpose, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) are adopted. It is shown how the model can be used to forecast new infection cases and new deceased and how the uncertainties associated to this prediction can be quantified. This approach has the advantage of being relatively simple, grouping in few mathematical parameters the many conditions which affect the spreading of the disease. On the other hand, it requires previous data from the disease transmission in the country, being better suited for regions where the epidemic is not at a very early stage. With the estimated parameters at hand, one can use the model to predict the evolution of the disease, which in turn enables authorities to plan their actions. Moreover, one key advantage is the straightforward interpretation of these parameters and their influence over the evolution of the disease, which enables altering some of them, so that one can evaluate the effect of public policy, such as social distancing. The results presented for the selected countries confirm the accuracy to perform predictions.","Paiva, Henrique Mohallem; Afonso, Rubens Junqueira Magalhães; de Oliveira, Igor Luppi; Garcia, Gabriele Fernandes",PLoS One,,247

The selected secondary metabolites have been experimentally validated and reported as potent antiviral agents against genetically-close human viruses. The plants have also been used as a folk medicine to treat cold, cough, asthma, bronchitis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome in India and across the globe since time immemorial. The present study aimed to assess the repurposing possibility of potent antiviral compounds with SARS-CoV-2 target proteins and also with host-specific receptor and activator protease that facilitates the viral entry into the host body. Molecular docking (MDc) was performed to study molecular affinities of antiviral compounds with aforesaid target proteins. The top-scoring conformations identified through docking analysis were further validated by 100â¯ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulation run. The stability of the conformation was studied in detail by investigating the binding free energy using MM-PBSA method. Finally, the binding affinities of all the compounds were also compared with a reference ligand, remdesivir, against the target protein RdRp. Additionally, pharmacophore features, 3D structure alignment of potent compounds and Bayesian machine learning model were also used to support the MDc and MD simulation. Overall, the study emphasized that curcumin possesses a strong binding ability with host-specific receptors, furin and ACE2. In contrast, gingerol has shown strong interactions with spike protein, and RdRp and quercetin with main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. In fact, all these target proteins play an essential role in mediating viral replication, and therefore, compounds targeting aforesaid target proteins are expected to block the viral replication and transcription. Overall, gingerol, curcumin and quercetin own multitarget binding ability that can be used alone or in combination to enhance therapeutic efficacy against COVID-19. The obtained results encourage further in vitro and in vivo investigations and also support the traditional use of antiviral plants preventively.","Kumar Verma, Akalesh; Kumar, Vikas; Singh, Sweta; Goswami, Bhabesh Ch; Camps, Ihosvany; Sekar, Aishwarya; Yoon, Sanghwa; Lee, Keun Woo",Biomed Pharmacother,,247

A retrospective case study was performed at two designated hospitals for COVID-19. Patients (56 children and 63 adults) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild pneumonia were randomly enrolled in this study. The median age of the children was 7.0 years, and 51.79% of them were boys. The median age of the adults was 57 years, and 47.62% were men. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, sputum and diarrhoea. There were no significant differences in symptoms between children and adult patients. In terms of immunological indices on admission, adult patients displayed typical leukopenia and markedly higher levels of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 than child patients. The elevation of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6 in adults induced more extensive lung injury. The effective and non-aggressive immune response successfully resisted SARS-CoV-2 invasion and maintained mild symptoms in child patients. The correlation of higher IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 with the lung injury might be evidence that preventing excessive cytokine production can avoid further lung damage in these patients.","Yuan, Yin; Wang, Qiu-Peng; Sun, Dan; Wu, Zu-Bo; Peng, Hua; Liu, Xin-Wen; Liu, Ya-Ling",Curr Med Sci,,247

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study between March 27 and May 18, 2020, in a single-center coronavirus disease-designated ICU at a tertiary care German hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with COVID-19 were treated with open surgical tracheostomy due to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and ventilation data were obtained from medical records in a retrospective manner. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV­2 infection and surgical tracheostomy were analyzed. The age range was 42-87 years. All patients received open tracheostomy between 2-16 days after admission. Ventilation after tracheostomy was less invasive (reduction in PEAK and positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]) and lung compliance increased over time after tracheostomy. Also, sedative drugs could be reduced, and patients had a reduced need of norepinephrine to maintain hemodynamic stability. Six of 18 patients died. All surgical staff were equipped with N99-masks and facial shields or with powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that open surgical tracheostomy can be performed without severe complications in patients with COVID-19. Tracheostomy may reduce invasiveness of mechanical ventilation and the need for sedative drugs and norepinehprine. Recommendations for personal protective equipment (PPE) for surgical staff should be followed when PPE is available to avoid contamination of the personnel.","Schuler, Patrick J; Greve, Jens; Hoffmann, Thomas K; Hahn, Janina; Boehm, Felix; Bock, Bastian; Reins, Johannes; Ehrmann, Ulrich; Barth, Eberhard; Traeger, Karl; Jungwirth, Bettina; Wepler, Martin",HNO,,247
363267,COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer,2020,"BACKGROUND: Indonesia has the highest maternal mortality rate in South East Asia, that a third of the mortality is caused by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including preeclampsia and eclampsia. Research suggests that maternal deaths from HDP are avoidable with appropriate initial management in primary care. However, little is known regarding the exact way HDP management is conducted in Indonesian primary care. This research aims to explore the way HDP management is provided, including its barriers and facilitators in Indonesian primary care settings. METHODS: This research applied a practical qualitative methodology using interviews with a topic guide. It is guided by the implementation science framework of the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework and Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) to design and evaluate complex healthcare interventions. Primary care key stakeholders from Yogyakarta province were recruited from May-December 2018. The interviews were conducted in face-to-face, telephone, and teleconference interviews. Data from the interviews were analysed thematically using a mix of inductive and deductive approaches. RESULTS: A total of 24 participants were interviewed, consisting of four general practitioners, five midwives, three nurses, three obstetricians, a cardiologist, five policymakers and three women with a previous history of HDP. Referrals are the usual management performed for HDP women in primary care and the primary care providers' practice is challenged by three identified themes: (i) providers' limited confidence to perform HDP management, (ii) fragmented continuity of care, and (iii) community beliefs. Many participants also desired to have more focused guidance to improve HDP management in primary care practice. CONCLUSION: Even though Indonesian antenatal care and referrals are generally accessible, there are many challenges and fragmentation of HDP management. The most prominent challenge is the primary care providers' lack of confidence in performing the management and the 'elephant' of an urgent need of practice guidelines in primary care that has never been appropriately described in the literature. Further development of an evidence-based primary care-focused guidance will potentially improve primary care providers' skills to perform optimal HDP management and provide appropriate education to their patients.","Ekawati, Fitriana Murriya; Emilia, Ova; Gunn, Jane; Licqurish, Sharon; Lau, Phyllis",BMC Fam Pract,,247

The field advanced from a publicly available viral genome to a commercialized globally scalable diagnostic biomarker test in less than 2 months, and first-in-human dosing with vaccines and repurposed antivirals followed shortly thereafter. This unprecedented efficiency was driven by three key factors: 1) international multistakeholder collaborations, 2) widespread data sharing, and 3) flexible regulatory standards tailored to meet the urgency of the situation. Learning from the remarkable success achieved during this public health crisis, we are proposing a biomarker-centric approach throughout the drug development pipeline. Although all therapeutic areas would benefit from end-to-end biomarker science, efforts should be prioritized to areas with the greatest unmet medical needs, including neurodegenerative diseases, chronic lower respiratory diseases, metabolic disorders, and malignant neoplasms. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Faced with the unprecedented threat of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, the biomedical community collaborated to develop a globally scalable diagnostic biomarker (viral DNA) that catalyzed therapeutic development at breathtaking speeds. Learning from this remarkable efficiency, we propose a multistakeholder biomarker-centric approach to drug development across therapeutic areas with unmet medical needs.","Fader, Kelly A; Zhang, Jiangwei; Menetski, Joseph P; Thadhani, Ravi I; Antman, Elliott M; Friedman, Gary S; Ramaiah, Shashi K; Vaidya, Vishal S",J Pharmacol Exp Ther,,247

On this basis, the current paper aims to provide recommendations for future research, practice and policy regarding children during pandemics. METHOD: A total of 2195 records were retrieved from the PsycINFO, SCOPUS and MEDLINE databases, and three from Google Scholar. RESULTS: Including only those papers that focused on children or adolescent's mental health in association with respiratory infectious outbreaks, 11 articles were identified. The majority of research utilized qualitative or retrospective hospital record data. Children and adolescents reported fear and anxiety, as well as disruptions to their day to day routines as a result of outbreaks. However, children were also able to demonstrate resilience during outbreaks with the right support. CONCLUSIONS: Children's psychological response to the outbreak appeared to be largely attributed to how their parents, healthcare providers and the media communicated the event.

366669,Hydroxychloroquine can potentially interfere with immune function in COVID-19 patients: Mechanisms and insights,2021,"BACKGROUND: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the COVID-19 crisis affecting the whole world. This virus can provoke acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to overcrowed the intensive care unit (ICU). Over the last months, worldwide experience demonstrated that the ARDS in COVID-19 patients are in many ways ""atypical"". The mortality rate in ventilated patients is high despite the application of the gold standard treatment (protective ventilation, curare, prone position, inhaled NO). Several studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could interact negatively on red blood cell homeostasis. Furthermore, SarsCov2 creates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are toxic and generate endothelial dysfunction. Hypothesis/objective(s) We hypothesis that HEMO2Life® administrated intravenously is safe and could help symptomatically the patient condition. It would increase arterial oxygen content despite lung failure and allow better tissue oxygenation control. The use of HEMO2Life® is also interesting due to its anti-oxidative effect preventing cytokine storm induced by the SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation of the hypothesis: Hemarina is based on the properties of the hemoglobin of the Arenicola marina sea-worm (HEMO2Life®). This extracellular hemoglobin has an oxygen capacity 40 times greater than the hemoglobin of vertebrates. Furthermore, the size of this molecule is 250 times smaller than a human red blood cell, allowing it to diffuse in all areas of the microcirculation, without diffusing outside the vascular sector. It possesses an antioxidative property du a Superoxide Dismutase Activity. This technology has been the subject of numerous publications and HEMO2Life® was found to be well-tolerated and did not induce toxicity. It was administered intravenously to hamsters and rats, and showed no acute effect on heart rate and blood pressure and did not cause microvascular vasoconstriction. In preclinical in vivo models (mice, rats, and dogs), HEMO2Life® has enabled better tissue oxygenation, especially in the brain. This molecule has already been used in humans in organ preservation solutions and the patients showed no abnormal clinical signs. CONSEQUENCES OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The expected benefits of HEMO2Life® for COVID-19 patients are improved survival, avoidance of tracheal intubation, shorter oxygen supplementation, and the possibility of treating a larger number of patients as molecular respirator without to use an invasive machine.","Lupon, Elise; Lellouch, Alexandre G; Zal, Franck; Cetrulo, Curtis L; Lantieri, Laurent A",Med Hypotheses,,247

This paper utilises both single-locus analysis and joint-SNPs analysis for detection of significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the phenotypes of symptomatic vs. asymptomatic, the early collection time vs. the late collection time, the old vs. the young, and the male vs. the female. Also, this paper analyses the relationship between any two SNPs via linkage disequilibrium analysis, and visualises the patterns of cumulative mutations of SNPs over collection time. The results are in three folds. First, the SNP which locates at the nucleotide position 4321 is found to be an independent significant locus associated with all the first three phenotypes. Moreover, 12 significant SNPs are found in the first two studies. Second, gene orf1ab containing SNP-4321 is detected to be significantly associated with the first three phenotypes, and the three genes, S, ORF3a, and N, are detected significant in the first two phenotypes. Third, some of the detected genes or SNPs are related to the SARS-COV-2 as supported by literature survey, which indicates that the results here may be helpful for further investigation.","Lv, Jinxiong; Tu, Shikui; Xu, Lei",IEEE/ACM trans. comput. biol. bioinform.

368614,Quantitative assessment of retinal changes in COVID-19 patients,2021,"The ongoing pandemic of global concern has killed about three million humans and affected around 151 million people worldwide, as of April 30, 2021. Although recently approved vaccines for COVID-19 are engendering hope, finding new ways to cure the viral pandemic is still a quest for researchers worldwide. Major pandemics in history have been of viral origin, such as SARS, MERS, H1NI, Spanish flu, and so on. A larger emphasis has been on discovering potential vaccines, novel antiviral drugs, and agents that can mitigate the viral infection symptoms; however, a relatively new area, RNA interference (RNAi), has proven effective as an antiviral agent. The RNAi phenomenon has been largely exploited to cure cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and some rare diseases. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently approved three siRNA products for human use that garner significant hope in siRNA therapeutics for coronaviruses. There have been some commentaries and communications addressing this area. We have summarized and illustrated the significance and the potential of the siRNA therapeutics available as of April 30, 2021 to combat the ongoing viral pandemic and the emerging new variants such as B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Numerous successful in vitro studies and several investigations to address the clinical application of siRNA therapeutics provide great hope in this field. This seminal Review describes the significance of siRNA-based therapy to treat diverse viral infections in addition to the current coronavirus challenge. In addition, we have thoroughly reviewed the patents approved for coronaviruses, the major challenges in siRNA therapy, and the potential approaches to address them, followed by innovation and prospects.","Sajid, Muhammad Imran; Moazzam, Muhammad; Cho, Yeseom; Kato, Shun; Xu, Ava; Way, J J; Lohan, Sandeep; Tiwari, Rakesh K",Mol Pharm,,247

369425,Randomized Clinical Trials and COVID-19: Managing Expectations,2020,"BACKGROUND: In February 2020, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was reported in fitness centers in Cheonan, Korea. METHODS: From February 24 to March 13, an epidemiological investigation was conducted on the fitness center outbreak. All those who were screened were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Contacts were traced and self-isolated for 14 days. We determined the epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and estimated the time-dependent reproduction number to assess the transmission dynamics of the infection. RESULTS: A total of 116 cases were confirmed, and 1,687 contacts were traced. The source cases were 8 Zumba instructors who led aerobics classes in 10 fitness centers, and had the largest average number of contacts. A total of 57 Zumba class participants, 37 of their family members, and 14 other contacts were confirmed as cases. The attack rate was 7.3%. The contacts at Zumba classes and homes had a higher attack rate than other contacts. The mean serial interval (± standard deviation) were estimated to be 5.2 (± 3.8) days. The time-dependent reproduction number was estimated to be 6.1 at the beginning of the outbreak, but it dropped to less than 1, 2 days after the epidemiological investigation was launched. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak was effectively contained with rigorous contact tracing, isolating, and testing in combination with social distancing without a lock-down.","Bae, Sanghyuk; Kim, Hwami; Jung, Tae Young; Lim, Ji Ae; Jo, Da Hye; Kang, Gi Seok; Jeong, Seung Hee; Choi, Dong Kwon; Kim, Hye Jin; Cheon, Young Hee; Chun, Min Kyo; Kim, Miyoung; Choi, Siwon; Chun, Chaemin; Shin, Seung Hwan; Kim, Hee Kyoung; Park, Young Joon; Park, Ok; Kwon, Ho Jang",J Korean Med Sci,,247

370361,Early-onset symptomatic radiation necrosis after stereotactic radiosurgery in the setting of COVID-19 infection,2021,"Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus have boosted the need of knowledge about inactivation mechanisms to minimize the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be disabled by heating, the exposure time for total inactivation depending on the reached temperature (e.g. more than 45 min at 329 K or less than 5 min at 373 K. In spite of recent crystallographic structures, little is known about the molecular changes induced by the temperature. Here, we unravel the molecular basis of the effect of the temperature over the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which is a homotrimer with three identical monomers, by executing atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at 298, 310, 324, 338, 358 and 373 K. Furthermore, both the closed down and open up conformational states, which affect the accessibility of receptor binding domain, have been considered. Our results suggest that the spike homotrimer undergoes drastic changes in the topology of the hydrogen bonding interactions and important changes on the secondary structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD), while electrostatic interactions (i.e. salt bridges) are mainly preserved. The proposed inactivation mechanism has important implications for engineering new approaches to fight the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, as for example, cleaving or reorganizing the hydrogen bonds through chaotropic agents or nanoparticles with local surface resonant plasmon effect.","Martí, Didac; Torras, Juan; Bertran, Oscar; Turon, Pau; Alemán, Carlos",,,247

As a result, clinical educators must quickly transition away from in-person sessions and develop effective virtual learning opportunities instead. This virtual resource was designed to replace a clinical simulation session for the physical examination course for medical students in the preclinical years. Methods: We designed an online interactive module in three sections for preclinical (first- or second-year) medical students who had not yet learned the respiratory physical exam. The first section incorporated demonstration and practice of the components of the respiratory physical exam that could be effectively taught via videoconferencing software. Following this, students conducted a telemedicine encounter with a standardized patient and received patient-centered feedback evaluating their communication skills. The final segment involved a case discussion and clinical reasoning component. Results: These sessions were implemented for 122 first-year medical students. The module was well received by the students. A majority felt that it helped improve their telemedicine communication skills (93%), interpretation of physical exam findings (84%), development of differential diagnosis (95%), and correlation of clinical and basic science content (93%). Discussion: Our pilot educational session demonstrates that this virtual instruction method is an effective tool for teaching basic clinical skills during medical school. Virtual learning resources allow remote instruction to take place and can be a supplement when face-to-face clinical teaching is not possible.","Afonso, Nelia; Kelekar, Arati; Alangaden, Anjali",MedEdPORTAL,,247

Use of biologic agents was not associated with COVID-19-associated hospitalization (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.32-1.73; p = 0.491) or mortality (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.12-6.21; p = 0.870). Older age, the presence of comorbid cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic renal failure independently predicted both COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The use of oral methotrexate was associated with an increased odds of COVID-associated hospitalization, whereas the use of biologic drugs was not associated with worse outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with psoriasis.","Kridin, Khalaf; Schonmann, Yochai; Tzur Bitan, Dana; Damiani, Giovanni; Peretz, Alon; Weinstein, Orly; Cohen, Arnon D",Am. j. clin. dermatol,,247
373712,AKI and Collapsing Glomerulopathy Associated with COVID-19 and APOL 1 High-Risk Genotype,2020,"There are, besides remdesivir, no approved antivirals for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. To aid in the search for antivirals against this virus, we explored the use of human tracheal airway epithelial cells (HtAEC) and human small airway epithelial cells (HsAEC) grown at the air-liquid interface (ALI). These cultures were infected at the apical side with one of two different SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Each virus was shown to replicate to high titers for extended periods of time (at least 8 days) and, in particular an isolate with the D614G in the spike (S) protein did so more efficiently at 35 °C than 37 °C. The effect of a selected panel of reference drugs that were added to the culture medium at the basolateral side of the system was explored. Remdesivir, GS-441524 (the parent nucleoside of remdesivir), EIDD-1931 (the parent nucleoside of molnupiravir) and IFN (ß1 and &#955;1) all resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of viral RNA and infectious virus titers collected at the apical side. However, AT-511 (the free base form of AT-527 currently in clinical testing) failed to inhibit viral replication in these in vitro primary cell models. Together, these results provide a reference for further studies aimed at selecting SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors for further preclinical and clinical development.","Do, Thuc Nguyen Dan; Donckers, Kim; Vangeel, Laura; Chatterjee, Arnab K; Gallay, Philippe A; Bobardt, Michael D; Bilello, John P; Cihlar, Tomas; De Jonghe, Steven; Neyts, Johan; Jochmans, Dirk",Antiviral Res,,247

374101,Taste and Smell Disorders in COVID-19 Patients: Role of Interleukin-6,2020,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent complication of COVID-19, so that the importance of adequate in-hospital thromboprophylaxis in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is well established. However, the incidence of VTE after discharge and whether postdischarge thromboprophylaxis is beneficial and safe are unclear. In this prospective observational single-center study, we report the incidence of VTE 6 weeks after hospitalization and the use of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis. METHODS: Patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were invited to a multidisciplinary follow-up clinic 6 weeks after discharge. D-dimer and C-reactive protein were measured, and all patients were screened for deep vein thrombosis with venous duplex-ultrasound. Additionally, selected high-risk patients received computed tomography pulmonary angiogram or ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan to screen for incidental pulmonary embolism. RESULTS: Of 485 consecutive patients hospitalized from March through June 2020, 146 patients were analyzed, of which 39% had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Postdischarge thromboprophylaxis was prescribed in 28% of patients, but was used more frequently after ICU stay (61%) and in patients with higher maximal D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels during hospitalization. Six weeks after discharge, elevated D-dimer values were present in 32% of ward and 42% of ICU patients. Only one asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (0.7%) and one symptomatic pulmonary embolism (0.7%) were diagnosed with systematic screening. No bleedings were reported. CONCLUSION: In patients who had been hospitalized with COVID-19, systematic screening for VTE 6 weeks after discharge revealed a low incidence of VTE. A strategy of selectively providing postdischarge thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients seems safe and potentially effective.","Engelen, Matthias M; Vandenbriele, Christophe; Balthazar, Tim; Claeys, Eveline; Gunst, Jan; Guler, Ipek; Jacquemin, Marc; Janssens, Stefan; Lorent, Natalie; Liesenborghs, Laurens; Peerlinck, Kathelijne; Pieters, Griet; Rex, Steffen; Sinonquel, Pieter; Van der Linden, Lorenz; Van Laer, Christine; Vos, Robin; Wauters, Joost; Wilmer, Alexander; Verhamme, Peter; Vanassche, Thomas",Semin Thromb Hemost,,247

Initial understanding was that transmission originated from respiratory droplets from an infected host to a susceptible host. However, indirect contact transmission of viable virus by fomites and through aerosols has also been suggested. Herein, we report the involvement of fine indoor air particulates with a diameter of &#8804; 2.5 µm (PM2.5) as the virus's transport agent. PM2.5 was collected over four weeks during 48-h measurement intervals in four separate hospital wards containing different infected clusters in a teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Our results indicated the highest SARS-CoV-2 RNA on PM2.5 in the ward with number of occupants. We suggest a link between the virus-laden PM2.5 and the ward's design.

376590,Levine Cancer Institute Approach to Pandemic Care of Patients With Cancer,2020,"Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, laboratory testing to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) has played a central role in mitigating the spread of the virus (1). Soon after the viral genome sequences were available, several RT-qPCR assays were developed and made available by World Health Organization (WHO) for public use (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/whoinhouseassays.pdf). The primer and probe sequences for these assays were chosen from multiple target genes within the viral genome such as the E gene, RdRp gene, ORF1ab and N gene. Many commercial and laboratory-developed assays were developed for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on these primer and probe sequences. The large-scale sustained person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has led to many mutational events, some of which may affect the sensitivity and specificity of available PCR assays (2). Recently, mutations in the E gene (C26340T) and N gene (C29200T) were reported affecting the detection of target genes by two commercial assays in 8 and 1 patients, respectively. Interestingly, both mutations are of C>T type, a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that may be associated with strong host cell mRNA editing mechanisms known as APOBEC cytidine deaminase (3, 4). Another study found a G to U substitution in position 29140 that affected the sensitivity of detection of N gene-based assays (5). Here we report a novel N gene mutation (C29200A) seen in 3 patients, which affected the detection of SARS-CoV-2 N gene by a commercial assay.","Hasan, Mohammad Rubayet; Sundararaju, Sathyavathi; Manickam, Chidambaram; Mirza, Faheem; Al-Hail, Hamad; Lorenz, Stephan; Tang, Patrick",J. clin. microbiol,,247

METHODS: An observational study using data from a previous study conducted prior to the pandemic. We compared frequency of sexual intercourse, desire for pregnancy, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score, contraception type, and menstrual abnormalities among women during the pandemic with 6-12 months prior to the pandemic. Participants were contacted by telephone for questioning. RESULTS: Average frequency of sexual intercourse was significantly increased during the pandemic compared with 6-12 months prior (2.4 vs 1.9, P=0.001). Before the pandemic 19 (32.7%) participants desired to become pregnant, whereas during the pandemic it had decreased to 3 (5.1%) (P=0.001). Conversely, use of contraception during the pandemic significantly decreased among participants compared with prior (24 vs 10, P=0.004). Menstrual disorders were more common during the pandemic than before (27.6% vs 12.1%, P=0.008). Participants had significantly better FSFI scores before the pandemic compared with scores during the pandemic (20.52 vs 17.56, P=0.001).

To protect their health, effective occupational health and safety measures (OHSM) are necessary. Outpatient caregivers (n = 15) participated in semi-structured telephone interviews in May/June 2020 (1) to examine the pandemic-related OHSM that have been implemented in their outpatient care services, as well as (2) to identify their corresponding unmet needs. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed by using qualitative content analysis in accordance with Mayring. Available OHSM in outpatient care services described by outpatient caregivers mainly included personal protective equipment (PPE) and surface disinfection means after an initial shortage in the first peak of the pandemic. Further OHSM implied social distancing, increased hygiene regulations and the provision of pandemic-related information by the employer, as well as the possibility to consult a company doctor. Our study revealed that OHSM were largely adapted to the health threats posed by COVID-19, however an optimum has not yet been achieved.

We collected complete genome sequences from human samples in Saudi Arabia and data on the multiple risk factors of human MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia reported from 2012 to 2018. By matching each sequence to human cases, we identified isolates as hospital outbreak-associated cases or sporadic cases. We used Bayesian phylogenetic methods including temporal, discrete trait analysis and phylogeography to uncover transmission routes of MERS-CoV isolates between hospital outbreaks and sporadic cases. Of the 120 sequences collected between 19 June 2012 and 23 January 2017, there were 64 isolates from hospital outbreak-associated cases and 56 from sporadic cases. Overall, MERS-CoV is fast evolving at 7.43 × 10-4 substitutions per site per year. Isolates from hospital outbreaks showed unusually fast evolutionary speed in a shorter time-frame than sporadic cases. Multiple introductions of different MERS-CoV strains occurred in three separate hospital outbreaks. MERS-CoV appears to be mutating in humans.

However, the need for several reagents and steps and the high cost of PCR hinder its worldwide implementation to contain the outbreak. Here, we report a cotton-tipped electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus antigen. Unlike the reported approaches, we integrated the sample collection and detection tools into a single platform by coating screen-printed electrodes with absorbing cotton padding. The immunosensor was fabricated by immobilizing the virus nucleocapsid (N) protein on carbon nanofiber-modified screen-printed electrodes which were functionalized by diazonium electrografting. The detection of the virus antigen was achieved via swabbing followed by competitive assay using a fixed amount of N protein antibody in the solution. A square wave voltammetric technique was used for the detection. The limit of detection for our electrochemical biosensor was 0.8 pg/mL for SARS-CoV-2, indicating very good sensitivity for the sensor. The biosensor did not show significant cross-reactivity with other virus antigens such as influenza A and HCoV, indicating high selectivity of the method. Moreover, the biosensor was successfully applied for the detection of the virus antigen in spiked nasal samples showing excellent recovery percentages. Thus, our electrochemical immunosensor is a promising diagnostic tool for the direct rapid detection of the COVID-19 virus that requires no sample transfer or pretreatment.","Eissa, Shimaa; Zourob, Mohammed",Anal Chem,,247

METHODS: We studied a total of 143 patients with COVID-19 from January 29, 2020 to February 29, 2020. Demographic and clinical data, laboratory data, including ultrasound scans of the lower extremities, and outcome variables were obtained, and comparisons were made between groups with and without DVT. RESULTS: Of the 143 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (age 63±14 years, 74 [51.7%] men), 66 patients developed lower extremity DVT (46.1%: 23 [34.8%] with proximal DVT and 43 [65.2%] with distal DVT). Compared with patients who did not have DVT, patients with DVT were older and had a lower oxygenation index, a higher rate of cardiac injury, and worse prognosis, including an increased proportion of deaths (23 [34.8%] versus 9 [11.7%]; P=0.001) and a decreased proportion of patients discharged (32 [48.5%] versus 60 [77.9%]; P<0.001). Multivariant analysis showed an association only between CURB-65 (confusion status, urea, respiratory rate, and blood pressure) score 3 to 5 (odds ratio, 6.122; P=0.031), Padua prediction score &#8805;4 (odds ratio, 4.016; P=0.04), D-dimer >1.0 µg/mL (odds ratio, 5.818; P<0.014), and DVT in this cohort, respectively. The combination of a CURB-65 score 3 to 5, a Padua prediction score &#8805;4, and D-dimer >1.0 µg/mL has a sensitivity of 88.52% and a specificity of 61.43% for screening for DVT.

CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of DVT is high and is associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism may be protective in patients with a Padua protection score &#8805;4 after admission. Our data seem to suggest that COVID-19 is probably an additional risk factor for DVT in hospitalized patients.","Zhang, Li; Feng, Xiaokai; Zhang, Danqing; Jiang, Chunguo; Mei, Heng; Wang, Jing; Zhang, Cuihong; Li, Hong; Xia, Xiaoling; Kong, Shuangshuang; Liao, Jia; Jia, Huijun; Pang, Xueqin; Song, Yue; Tian, Ying; Wang, Bin; Wu, Chun; Yuan, Hongliang; Zhang, Yongxing; Li, Yuman; Sun, Wei; Zhang, Yanting; Zhu, Shuangshuang; Wang, Shuyuan; Xie, Yuji; Ge, Shuping; Zhang, Liming; Hu, Yu; Xie, Mingxing",Circulation,,247

We define and prove the existence of a perfect Bayesian Markov competitive equilibrium and contrast it with the efficient allocation subject to the same informational constraints. We identify two externalities, static (individual actions affect current risk of infection) and dynamic (individual actions affect future disease prevalence), and study how they are affected by limitations on testing and enforcement. We prove that a planner with imperfect enforcement will always wish to curtail activity, but that its incentives vanish as testing becomes perfect. When a vaccine arrives far into the future, the planner with perfect enforcement may encourage activity before herd immunity. We find that lockdown policies have modest welfare gains, whereas quarantine policies are effective even with imperfect testing.","Phelan, Thomas; Toda, Alexis Akira",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04455v1.pdf,247

389513,Economical Zoning Strategy and its Effectiveness for Patients with COVID-19,2020,"Linear B-cell epitope prediction research has received a steadily growing interest ever since the first method was developed in 1981. B-cell epitope identification with the help of an accurate prediction method can lead to an overall faster and cheaper vaccine design process, a crucial necessity in the COVID-19 era. Consequently, several B-cell epitope prediction methods have been developed over the past few decades, but without significant success. In this study, we review the current performance and methodology of some of the most widely used linear B-cell epitope predictors which are available via a command-line interface, namely, BcePred, BepiPred, ABCpred, COBEpro, SVMTriP, LBtope, and LBEEP. Additionally, we attempted to remedy performance issues of the individual methods by developing a consensus classifier, which combines the separate predictions of these methods into a single output, accelerating the epitope-based vaccine design. While the method comparison was performed with some necessary caveats and individual methods might perform much better for specialized datasets, we hope that this update in performance can aid researchers towards the choice of a predictor, for the development of biomedical applications such as designed vaccines, diagnostic kits, immunotherapeutics, immunodiagnostic tests, antibody production, and disease diagnosis and therapy.","Galanis, Kosmas A; Nastou, Katerina C; Papandreou, Nikos C; Petichakis, Georgios N; Pigis, Diomidis G; Iconomidou, Vassiliki A",Int. j. mol. sci.

389723,The use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is associated with a lower likelihood of COVID-19 infection,2021,"A severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused a pandemic COVID-19 disease that infected approximately 94 million and killed more than 2,000,000 people worldwide. Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif (RBM) of its envelope spike protein for binding the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain viral entry. Currently, extensive efforts are being made to produce vaccines against a surface fragment of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein, in order to boost protective antibodies that can inhibit virus-ACE2 interaction to prevent viral entry. It was previously unknown how spike protein-targeting antibodies would affect innate inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we generated a highly purified recombinant protein corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV-2, and used it to screen for cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We found two RBM-binding mAbs that competitively inhibited its interaction with human ACE2, and specifically blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in both human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophage cultures. Our findings have suggested a possible strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2-elicited ""cytokine storm,"" and revealed a potentially anti-inflammatory and protective mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 spike-based vaccines.","Qiang, Xiaoling; Zhu, Shu; Li, Jianhua; Chen, Weiqiang; Yang, Huan; Wang, Ping; Tracey, Kevin J; Wang, Haichao",J. leukoc. biol,,247

The inhibitory potentials of the compounds against SARS-CoV-2 drug targets - main protease (Mpro), spike protein (Spro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) were investigated through molecular docking analysis. The binding free energy of the protein-ligand complexes were estimated, pharmacophore models were generated and the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties of the compounds were determined. The compounds displayed various levels of binding affinities for the SARS-CoV-2 drug targets. Bisimidazole C2 scored highest against all the targets, with its aromatic rings including the two imidazole groups contributing to the binding. Among the phenyl-substituted 1H-imidazoles, C9 scored highest against all targets. C11 scored highest against Spro and C12 against Mpro and RdRp among the thiophene-imidazoles. The compounds interacted with HIS 41 - CYS 145 and GLU 288 - ASP 289 - GLU 290 of Mpro, ASN 501 of Spro receptor binding motif and some active site amino acids of RdRp. These novel imidazole compounds could be further developed as drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 following lead optimization and experimental studies.","Johnson, Titilayo O; Adegboyega, Abayomi Emmanuel; Iwaloye, Opeyemi; Eseola, Omokehinde Abiodun; Plass, Winfried; Afolabi, Boluwatife; Rotimi, Damilare; Ahmed, Eman I; Albrakati, Ashraf; Batiha, Gaber E; Adeyemi, Oluyomi Stephen",J Pharmacol Sci,,247

METHODS: This study is supported and endorsed by the Asia Pacific Society of Interventional Cardiology. Due to the inability to have face to face discussions during the pandemic, an online survey was performed by inviting key opinion leaders (cardiac surgeon/interventional cardiologist/echocardiologist) in the field of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in Asia to participate. The answers to a series of questions pertaining to the impact of COVID-19 on TAVI were collected and analyzed. These led subsequently to an expert consensus recommendation on the conduct of TAVI during the pandemic. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in a 25% (10-80) reduction of case volume and 53% of operators required triaging to manage their patients with severe aortic stenosis. The two most important parameters used to triage were symptoms and valve area. Periprocedural changes included the introduction of teleconsultation, preprocedure COVID-19 testing, optimization of protests, and catheterization laboratory set up. In addition, length of stay was reduced from a mean of 4.4 to 4 days. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the delivery of TAVI services to patients in Asia. This expert recommendation on best practices may be a useful guide to help TAVI teams during this period until a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widely available.","Tay, Edgar L; Hayashida, Kentaro; Chen, Mao; Yin, Wei-Hsien; Park, Duk-Woo; Seth, Ashok; Kao, Hsien-Li; Lin, Mao-Shin; Ho, Kay-Woon; Buddhari, Wacin; Chandavimol, Mann; Posas, Fabio-Enriques; Nguyen, Quang N; Kong, William; Rosli, M A; Hon, Jimmy; Firman, Doni; Lee, Michael",J. card. surg,,247

But with the lack of technology and medical equipment and the existence of low health awareness in many countries, there is an intense research to combat with that massive problem. In this context, objective of this paper is to discover the spread of the virus according to the countries, by following what users around the world publish on social networking sites, especially on Twitter. In detail, we proposed an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based text classification model that depends on three main steps to discover approximate numbers of infects, by checking the symptoms that published within Twitter posts. A dataset publishing cases of infected and the accompanying symptoms of more than 112 k cases was considered and a model with Naïve Bayes was trained through a comparative work with eight different classifiers. Naïve Bayes is a transparent machine learning technique so it is easier to use probabilistic relations between inputs and the outputs to explain results. Eventually, that XAI-based Naïve Bayes model reached to the highest accuracy rate with 93.6%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Alaff, A. J.

The social meanings attached to masks may influence their use, but remain underinvestigated. METHODS: We systematically searched eight databases for studies containing qualitative data on public mask use during past epidemics, and used meta-ethnography to explore their social meanings. We compared key concepts within and across studies, then jointly wrote a critical synthesis. RESULTS: We found nine studies from China (n=5), Japan (n=1), Mexico (n=1), South Africa (n=1) and the USA (n=1). All studies describing routine mask use during epidemics were from East Asia. Participants identified masks as symbols of solidarity, civic responsibility and an allegiance to science. This effect was amplified by heightened risk perception (eg, during SARS in 2003), and by seeing masks on political leaders and in outdoor public spaces. Masks also acted as containment devices to manage threats to identity at personal and collective levels. In China and Japan, public and corporate campaigns framed routine mask use as individual responsibility for disease prevention in return for state- or corporate-sponsored healthcare access. In most studies, mask use waned as risk perception fell. In contexts where masks were mostly worn by patients with specific diseases (eg, for patients with tuberculosis in South Africa), or when trust in government was low (eg, during H1N1 in Mexico), participants described masks as stigmatising, uncomfortable or oppressive. CONCLUSION: Face masks can take on positive social meanings linked to solidarity and altruism during epidemics. Unfortunately, these positive meanings can fail to take hold when risk perception falls, rules are seen as complex or unfair, and trust in government is low. At such times, ensuring continued use is likely to require additional efforts to promote locally appropriate positive social meanings, simplifying rules for use and ensuring fair enforcement.","Tsang, Po Man; Prost, Audrey",,,247

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 on orthopaedic practice and training in the UK. METHODS: Surgeons throughout UK hospitals were asked to complete an electronic survey relating to orthopaedic practice and training in their hospital. The nationwide survey was conducted during the first peak of COVID-19 cases in the UK between 20 March 2020 and 20 April 2020. RESULTS: All 202 UK participants reported disruption to their daily practice. 91% reported all elective operating had been cancelled and trauma continued as normal in only 24% of cases. 70% reported disruption to trauma operating. Elective clinic capacity significantly reduced with no elective clinics running as normal. 55% reported their elective clinics completely cancelled, whilst 38% reported elective clinics running at a reduced capacity, with non-urgent appointments postponed. Only 9% of fracture clinics ran as normal, and 69% had a reduced service. 67% reported teaching and study leave cancelled. Significantly, 69% of participants felt the pandemic would result in a delay to completion of registrar training programmes. CONCLUSION: This is the first nationwide survey assessing the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 on UK orthopaedic practice and training, during the peak of the pandemic. It highlights the scale of the challenge ahead for the specialty, including during the recovery phase and post-recovery phase of the pandemic.","Khan, Hiba; Williamson, Mike; Trompeter, Alex",Eur. j. orthop. surg. traumatol,,247

Shortly after, SARS-CoV-19 was identified as the responsible coronavirus for the heavy progress of the disease, which can manifest itself distinctively in different individuals. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered a pandemic because of its high contagiousness before COVID-19 associated symptoms actually appear. In response to the rapid and continuous spread of the virus around the globe governments have mobilized their forces to restrict contact and thus avoid further infection and invested significant resources in treatment and prevention strategies to tackle COVID-19. As a result, US FDA and EMA have granted emergency use authorization for two mRNA-based vaccines, namely the vaccines developed by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, for use in the USA and Europe.

Here we summarize and rationalize the results obtained by various mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic approaches applied to the functional characterization of proteins and pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2-mediated infections in humans. Comparative analysis of cell-lines versus tissue samples indicates that our knowledge in proteome profile alternation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is still incomplete and the tissue-specific response to SARS-CoV-2 infection can probably not be recapitulated efficiently by in vitro experiments. However, regardless of the viral infection period, sample types, and experimental strategies, a thorough cross-comparison of the recently published proteome, phosphoproteome, and interactome datasets led to the identification of a common set of proteins and kinases associated with PI3K-Akt, EGFR, MAPK, Rap1, and AMPK signaling pathways. Ephrin receptor A2 (EPHA2) was identified by 11 studies including all proteomic platforms, suggesting it as a potential future target for SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and the development of new therapeutic strategies. We further discuss the potentials of future proteomics strategies for identifying prognostic SARS-CoV-2 responsive age-, gender-dependent, tissue-specific protein targets.","Ahsan, Nagib; Rao, R Shyama Prasad; Wilson, Rashaun S; Punyamurtula, Ujwal; Salvato, Fernanda; Petersen, Max; Ahmed, Mohammad Kabir; Abid, M Ruhul; Verburgt, Jacob C; Kihara, Daisuke; Yang, Zhibo; Fornelli, Luca; Foster, Steven B; Ramratnam, Bharat",Proteomics,,247

The public's knowledge and practices play an important role in curbing the spreading of the virus by following the health guidelines. This study aimed to assess the socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practices of Iraqi living in Mosul-Iraq towards COVID-19 during its rapid rise. A cross-sectional online survey of 909 participants was conducted among a sample of the Mosul-Iraq population between 20th June to 1st July 2020. The survey included three parts: 1) socio-demographic characteristics, 2) participants' knowledge, 3) participants' practices. T-test, ANOVA, chi-square, and binary logistic regression were used. A p-value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. The results showed a knowledge and practice mean score of (12.91±1.67) and (21.56± 2.92) with cumulative knowledge and practice of 86% and 76% respectively towards COVID-19. Socio-demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, gender, level of education and employment were statistically related with a higher mean score of knowledge and practice towards the virus as P<0.05. We concluded that the majority of the respondents demonstrate a high level of knowledge and practices towards COVID-19 except for respondents with socio-demographic characteristics such as those who were younger, male respondents, those with lower education and those unemployed as such campaigns that will increase the knowledge and encourage adequate preventive practice towards COVID-19 should be targeted towards this group.","Saeed, Balsam Qubais; Al-Shahrabi, Rula; Bolarinwa, Obasanjo Afolabi",PLoS One,,247

Materials and methods: We performed an observational retrospective cohort study which includes the patients diagnosed as COVID-19 and received aluminum salts in addition to actual treatments during hospitalization as the treatment group (Alum Group). Patients who received standard COVID-19 treatment protocols in the Infectious Diseases Clinics were included as the Control Group. Clinical findings, laboratory parameters, length of stay, survival, radiological follow-up, intensive care and mechanical ventilation needs, the presence of comorbidity, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, symptoms, symptom recovery times, hospital stay times, treatment protocols, and clinical presence of pneumonia were examined in all patients. Advanced chemical composition analyzes of existing aluminum salts were also performed. Results: A total of 109 patients, 54 in the alum group and 55 in the control group, were included in the study. None of the patients in the aluminum group developed side effects due to the intake of aluminum salt. Survival status was significantly different between the two groups as there were 5 loss in the Control Group and none in the Alum Group (P = 0.023). The symptom recovery time was significantly shorter in the Alum Group; 2 (1­3) vs. 1 (1­2) days, P = 0.003. According to the paired samples analyses of the comparison between hospitalization and discharge, CRP levels significantly drops in the Alum Group (from 54.09 to 27, P = 0.001) but not in the Control Group. The drop was significantly same for the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and procalcitonin levels with P = 0.001. Conclusion: It has been observed that aluminum salts have beneficial effects in COVID-19 infected cases. Considering the low systemic toxicity of intermittent oral intake of aluminum salts as food supplements and the fact that pandemic control is still not achieved, the use of aluminum salts is promising.","Demir, Ali; Erayman, Ibrahim; Dogan, Oguz; KekiliI, Murat",Turk J Med Sci,,247

DESIGN: Multicentre evaluation incorporating quantitative and qualitative items. SETTING: Level II and level III UK neonatal units. POPULATION: Families of neonatal inpatients and neonatal staff. INTERVENTION: Use of a secure, cloud-based asynchronous video messaging service to send short messages from neonatal staff to families. Evaluation undertaken July-November 2019. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parental experience, including anxiety, involvement in care, relationships between parents and staff, and breastmilk expression. RESULTS: In pre-implementation surveys (n=41), families reported high levels of stress and anxiety and were receptive to use of the service. In post-implementation surveys (n=42), 88% perceived a benefit of the service on their neonatal experience. Families rated a positive impact of the service on anxiety, sleep, family involvement and relationships with staff. Qualitative responses indicated enhanced emotional closeness, increased involvement in care and a positive effect on breastmilk expression. Seventy-seven post-implementation staff surveys were also collected. Staff rated the service as easy to use, with minimal impact on workload. Seventy-one percent (n=55) felt the service had a positive impact on relationships with families. Staff identified the need to manage parental expectations in relation to the number of videos that could be sent. CONCLUSIONS: Asynchronous video messaging improves parental experience, emotional closeness to their baby and builds supportive relationships between families and staff. Asynchronous video supports models of family integrated care and can mitigate family separation, which could be particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kirolos, Sandy; Sutcliffe, Lynsey; Giatsi Clausen, Maria; Abernethy, Carolyn; Shanmugalingam, Shanthi; Bauwens, Nicole; Orme, Judith; Thomson, Kirsty; Grattan, Rosemary; Patel, Neil",Arch. dis. child. fetal neonatal ed,,247

Dada la alta tasa de mortalidad de la infección, la identificación oportuna y precisa de las manifestaciones cutáneas puede desempeñar un papel clave en el diagnóstico y manejo tempranos.Las manifestaciones cutáneas son comunes en infecciones virales, en el caso de la enfermedad por coronavirus se han reportado diversas manifestaciones, entre ellas las más comunes son: erupción morbilliforme, urticaria, erupciones vesiculares, lesiones acrales, y erupciones livedoides. Algunas de estas manifestaciones cutáneas surgen antes de los signos y síntomas más comúnmente asociados con COVID-19, lo que sugiere que podrían estar presentando signos de COVID-19.Los informes bibliográficos mostraron una gran heterogeneidad en las manifestaciones cutáneas asociadas a COVID-19, así como en sus períodos de latencia y los síntomas extracutáneos asociados. Se desconocen los mecanismos patógenos, aunque se han hipotetizado las funciones de una respuesta inmune hiperactiva, la activación del complemento y la lesión microvascular. Basándonos en nuestra experiencia y los datos bibliográficos, subdividimos las lesiones cutáneas notificadas en seis patrones clínicos principales: (I) erupción urticarial; (II) erupción eritematosa-maculopapular-morbilliforme confluente; (III) exantema papulovesicular; (IV) patrón acral similar a la chilblain; (V) patrón livedo reticularis­livedo racemosa-like; y (VI) patrón ""vasculítico"" purpúrico. Estos seis patrones se pueden fusionar en dos grupos principales: el primero - inflamatorio y exantematoso - incluye los tres primeros grupos mencionados anteriormente, y el segundo incluye las lesiones vasculopáticas y vasculíticas de los últimos tres grupos.Podemos concluir que las manifestaciones cutáneas son similares a la afectación cutánea que ocurre durante las infecciones virales comunes.","Febres Ramos, Richard Jeremy; Vilchez Bravo, Stephany Keila",Rev.

Here, we describe the integration of nine videos into a large‐enrollment (n = 356) introductory evolution and ecology course via weekly homework assignments. We predicted that videos that feature research stories from contemporary scientists could reinforce topics introduced in lecture and provide students with novel insights into the nature of scientific research. Using qualitative analysis of open‐ended written feedback from the students on each video assigned throughout the term (n = 133–229 responses per video) and on end‐of‐quarter evaluations (n = 243), we identified common categories of student perspectives. All videos received more positive than negative comments and all videos received comments indicating that students found them intellectually and emotionally stimulating, accessible, and relevant to course content. Additionally, all videos also received comments indicating some students found them intellectually unstimulating, though these comments were generally far less numerous than positive comments. Students responded positively to videos that incorporated at least one of the following: documentary‐style filming, very clear links to course content (especially hands‐on activities completed by the students), relevance to recent world events, clarity on difficult topics, and/or charismatic narrators or species. We discuss opportunities and challenges for the use of online educational videos in teaching ecology and evolution, and we provide guidelines instructors can use to integrate them into their courses.","Gerhart, Laci M.; Anderton, Brittany N.",Ecology and Evolution,,247

The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of the disease. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases are able to be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked. The distribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained. The epidemiology differs from country to country depending not only on the disease, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.",,,,247

402742,Comparative Analysis of the Level of Situational and Personal Anxiety of Medical Workers and Other Population Groups in a Pandemic of a New Coronavirus Infection - Covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although the need for whole blood is declining, so too are the number of first-time and repeat blood donors. To develop new recruitment and retention strategies, therefore, we need to draw on as wide a variation in blood donor motivations as possible. The primary aim of this study is to draw on a large survey of donors to develop a broad, theoretically instantiated typology of donor motivations to identify new and less common, yet practically important, motivations that have not been previously reported. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from the UK Blood Donor Survey run by NHS Blood and Transplant/Public Health England Epidemiology Unit (N = 61 123 donors), we analyze fixed (N = 52 225) and free (N = 8867) responses to develop a more comprehensive typology of blood donor motivations based on theories from the biology, psychology, philosophy, economics, and sociology of altruism. RESULTS: We identified 54 motivations, including a number of newly identified motivations, for blood donations which we organized into 12 superordinate categories (eg, ""inspiration via moral elevation,"" ""perceived social closeness,"" and ""fungibility of donations""). These are linked to intervention suggestions such as donating blood in memoriam or donating blood as an alternative to other charitable acts. CONCLUSION: We present the most comprehensive account of blood donor motivations to-date. This work also offers a structure for coding free-text responses, developing motivational measures, and identifying tangible interventions. Thus, we feel that this is a valuable resource for blood donor researchers, marketers, and policy makers.","Ferguson, Eamonn; Hill, Alexandra; Lam, Michael; Reynolds, Claire; Davison, Katy; Lawrence, Claire; Brailsford, Susan R",Transfusion,,247

Apart from angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, neuropilin-1 (NRP1) has been recently found to serve as another host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection; thus, blocking S1-NRP1 interaction can be a potential treatment for COVID-19. Herein, molecular recognition between SARS-CoV-2 S1 C-end rule (CendR) heptapeptide including small-molecule antagonists (EG00229 and EG01377) and the NRP1 was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations based on MM/PBSA method. The binding affinity and the number of hot-spot residues of EG01377/NRP1 complex were higher than those of CendR and EG00229 systems, in line with the reported experimental data as well as with the lower water accessibility at the ligand-binding site. The (i) T316, P317, and D320 and (ii) S346, T349, and Y353 residues were confirmed to respectively form H-bonds with the positively charged guanidinium group and the negatively charged carboxyl moiety of all studied ligands. Moreover, Rosetta protein design was employed to improve CendR peptide binding affinity to NRP1. The newly designed peptides, especially R683G and A684M, exhibited higher binding efficiency than the native CendR heptapeptide as well as the small-molecule EG00229 by forming more H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions with NPR1, suggesting that these designed peptides could be promising NRP1 inhibitors to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Klaewkla, Methus; Charoenwongpaiboon, Thanapon; Mahalapbutr, Panupong",J Mol Liq,,247

However, manifestations in other organs should not be ignored since they can also be a mode of transmission. We sought to describe the ocular manifestations of COVID-19 and investigate the association between ocular involvement and clinical presentation and laboratory outcomes. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. Ninety-three sequentially hospitalized and clinically confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in the study. The systemic and ocular symptoms, clinical findings, and laboratory outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 93 COVID-19 patients, 54 (58.1%) were male, and 39 (41.9%) were female. Mean age of the patients was 39.4 ± 21.9 (min 7, max 88) years. Twenty patients (n 21.5%) had at least one ocular abnormality. Most common findings included hyperemia (n = 20), epiphora (n = 9), increased secretion (n = 6), chemosis (n = 3), follicular conjunctivitis (n = 2), and episcleritis (n = 2). The most common symptom was photophobia (n 15). Patients with ocular involvement were more likely to have higher neutrophil counts (p = 0.001), and increased CRP (p < 0.001), PCT (p = 0.001), and ESR levels (p < 0.001). Mean lymphocyte count was statistically lower in patients with ocular manifestations (p = 0.001). Mean age and number of patients with fever over 37.3 °C in the ocular involvement group was found to be higher (p < 0.001, p = 0.006, respectively). CONCLUSION: Older age, high fever, increased neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and high levels of acute phase reactants seemed to be risk factors for ocular involvement.","Bostanci Ceran, Basak; Ozates, Serdar",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,,247

406060,Vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19,2020,"Social distancing prescribed by policy makers in response to COVID-19 raises important questions as to how effectively people of color can distance. Due to inequalities from residential segregation, Hispanic and Black populations have challenges in meeting health expectations. However, segregated neighborhoods also support the formation of social bonds that relate to healthy behaviors. We evaluate the question of non-White distancing using social mobility data from Google on three sites: workplaces, grocery stores, and recreational locations. Employing hierarchical linear modeling and geographically weighted regression, we find the relation of race/ethnicity to COVID-19 distancing is varied across the United States. The HLM models show that compared to Black populations, Hispanic populations overall more effectively distance from recreation sites and grocery stores: each point increase in percent Hispanic was related to residents being 0.092 percent less likely (p< 0.05) to visit recreational sites and 0.127 percent less likely (p< 0.01) to visit grocery stores since the onset of COVID-19. However, the GWR models show there are places where the percent Black is locally related to recreation distancing while percent Hispanic is not. Further, these models show the association of percent Black to recreation and grocery distancing can be locally as strong as 1.057 percent (p< 0.05) and 0.989 percent (p< 0.05), respectively. Next, the HLM models identified that Black/White residential isolation was related to less distancing, with each point of isolation residents were 11.476 percent more likely (p< 0.01) to go to recreational sites and 7.493 percent more likely (p< 0.05) to visit grocery stores compared to before COVID-19. These models did not find a measurable advantage/disadvantage for Black populations in these places compared to White populations. COVID-19 policy should not assume disadvantage in achieving social distancing accrue equally to different racial/ethnic minorities.","Gibbons, Joseph",PLoS One,,247
406200,A review of COVID-19 convalescent plasma use in COVID-19 with focus on proof of efficacy,2021,"Essential hypertension is the most common cardiovascular (CV) risk factor, being primarily involved in the pathogenesis of CV disease and mortality worldwide. Given the high prevalence and growing incidence of this clinical condition in the general population in both high and low-income countries, antihypertensive drug therapies are frequently prescribed in different hypertension-related CV diseases and comorbidities. Among these conditions, evidence are available demonstrating the clinical benefits of lowering blood pressure (BP) levels, particularly in those hypertensive patients at high or very high CV risk profile. Preliminary studies, performed during the Sars-COVID-19 epidemic, raised some concerns on the potential implication of hypertension and antihypertensive medications in the susceptibility of having severe pneumonia, particularly with regard to the use of drugs inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). These hypotheses were not confirmed by subsequent studies, which independently and systematically demonstrated no clinical harm of these drugs also in patients with Sars-COVID-19 infection. The aim of this narrative review is to critically discuss the available evidence supporting the use of antihypertensive therapies based RAS blocking agents in hypertensive patients with different CV risk profile and with additional clinical conditions or comorbidities, including Sars-COVID-19 infection, with a particular focus on single-pill combination therapies based on olmesartan medoxomil.","Presta, Vivianne; Figliuzzi, Ilaria; Citoni, Barbara; Gallo, Giovanna; Battistoni, Allegra; Tocci, Giuliano; Volpe, Massimo",High Blood Press Cardiovasc Prev,,247
406803,Oral manifestations accompanying and related to COVID-19: Overlooking the obvious,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide. In Indonesia, the first case was reported in early March 2020, and the numbers of confirmed infections have been increasing until now. Efforts to contain the virus globally and in Indonesia are ongoing. This is the very first manuscript using a spatial-temporal model to describe the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Indonesia, as well as providing a patient profile for all confirmed COVID-19 cases. METHOD: Data was collected from the official website of the Indonesia National Task Force for the Acceleration of COVID-19, from the period of 02 March 2020-02 August 2020. The data from RT-PCR confirmed, SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was categorized according to demographics, symptoms and comorbidities based on case categorization (confirmed, recovered, dead). The data collected provides granular and thorough information on time and geographical location for all 34 Provinces across Indonesia. RESULTS: A cumulative total of 111,450 confirmed cases of were reported in Indonesia during the study period. Of those confirmed cases 67.79% (75,551/111,450) were shown as recovered and 4.83% (5,382/111,450) of them as died. Patients were mostly male (50.52%; 56,300/111,450) and adults aged 31 to 45 years old (29.73%; 33,132/111,450). Overall patient presentation symptoms of cough and fever, as well as chronic disease comorbidities were in line with previously published data from elsewhere in South-East Asia. The data reported here, shows that from the detection of the first confirmed case and within a short time period of 40 days, all the provinces of Indonesia were affected by COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to provide detailed characteristics of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients in Indonesia, including their demographic profile and COVID-19 presentation history. It used a spatial-temporal analysis to present the epidemic spread from the very beginning of the outbreak throughout all provinces in the country. The increase of new confirmed cases has been consistent during this time period for all provinces, with some demonstrating a sharp increase, in part due to the surge in national diagnostic capacity. This information delivers a ready resource that can be used for prediction modelling, and is utilized continuously by the current Indonesian Task Force in order to advise on potential implementation or removal of public distancing measures, and on potential availability of healthcare capacity in their efforts to ultimately manage the outbreak.","Aisyah, Dewi Nur; Mayadewi, Chyntia Aryanti; Diva, Haniena; Kozlakidis, Zisis; Adisasmito, Wiku",PLoS One,,247
406804,Oral manifestations accompanying and related to COVID-19: Overlooking the obvious,2021,"In Mexico, significant ethical and social issues have been raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the most pressing issues are the extent of restrictive measures, the reciprocal duties to healthcare workers, the allocation of scarce resources, and the need for research. While policy and ethical frameworks are being developed to face these problems, the gender perspective has been largely overlooked in most of the issues at stake. Domestic violence is the most prevalent form of violence against women, which can be exacerbated during a pandemic: stress and economic uncertainty are triggers for abuse, and confinement limits access to support networks. Confinement also exacerbates the unfair distribution of unpaid labor, which is disproportionately assigned to women and girls, and highlights inequality in the overall labor market. Lack of security measures has resulted in attacks towards health workers, particularly female nurses, due to fear of contamination. Finally, resource results in lack of access to other health necessities, including sexual and reproductive health services. Research across all disciplines to face-and to learn from-this crisis should be done through a gender lens, because understanding the realities of women is essential to understand the pandemic's true effects in Mexico and the world.","Manrique De Lara, Amaranta; De Jesús Medina Arellano, María",J. bioeth. inq,,247
406952,The effect of propolis plus Hyoscyamus niger L. methanolic extract on clinical symptoms in patients with acute respiratory syndrome suspected to COVID-19: A clinical trial,2021,"On 15 March 2020, the President of the Republic of Ghana addressed the nation on anti-coronavirus measures which took effect immediately. He directed the Attorney-General to submit an emergency legislation to Parliament and the Minister for Health to issue an immediate Executive Instrument to regulate the relevant measures. Five days later, Parliament passed the Imposition of Restrictions Act, 2020 (IRA) after a voice count in its favour. A few days, thereafter, the President issued an Executive Instrument (E.I. 64) pursuant to the IRA. The minority members of Parliament, some legal scholars and interested Ghanaians expressed their disapproval of the procedures leading to the enactment of the IRA as well as its nature, form and content. The contentions cover multiple constitutional and legal grounds including the procedural propriety of using a voice vote in Parliament for emergency legislation, the necessity of a new emergency legislation and the time limit for the new emergency legislation. Essentially, these issues point to assessing the overall constitutionality of the law-making procedures and legislative provisions of the IRA. This is the focus of this paper. The paper argues that the IRA stands unconstitutional from the very beginning of its intended existence. The paper concludes that while the IRA is currently operational, its continued existence is challengeable under the 1992 Constitution of Ghana, thus, there is a window of opportunity to right the wrong.","Addadzi-Koom, Maame Efua",Theo.

407141,Correction to a novel framework for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 on computed tomography scans,2021,"Over the course of our lifetimes, we accumulate extensive experience associating the things that we see with the words we have learned to describe them. As a result, adults engaged in a visual search task will often look at items with labels that share phonological features with the target object, demonstrating that language can become activated even in non-linguistic contexts. This highly interactive cognitive system is the culmination of our linguistic and visual experiences-and yet, our understanding of how the relationship between language and vision develops remains limited. The present study explores the developmental trajectory of language-mediated visual search by examining whether children can be distracted by linguistic competitors during a non-linguistic visual search task. Though less robust compared to what has been previously observed with adults, we find evidence of phonological competition in children as young as 8 years old. Furthermore, the extent of language activation is predicted by individual differences in linguistic, visual, and domain-general cognitive abilities, with the greatest phonological competition observed among children with strong language abilities combined with weaker visual memory and inhibitory control. We propose that linguistic expertise is fundamental to the development of language-mediated visual search, but that the rate and degree of automatic language activation depends on interactions among a broader network of cognitive abilities.","Chabal, Sarah; Hayakawa, Sayuri; Marian, Viorica",Cogn Res Princ Implic,,247

However, whether the combined use of miR-124 and growth factors can increase the expression of neural related markers in human dental pulp stem cells has been remained unknown so far. In this study, human dental pulp stem cells were transfected with miR-124 following treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor or epidermal growth factor/basic fibroblast growth factor. The expression of some neural related markers (nestin, SOX2, ß-tubulin III, MAP2, and peripherin) was analyzed in two groups by qRT-PCR or immunofluorescence. Cellular treatment resulted in morphological changes including neurosphere-like colonies formation. Nestin and SOX2 were up-regulated, and MAP2 and peripherin were down-regulated in dental pulp stem cells transfected by miR-124 following treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Replacement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor with epidermal growth factor/ basic fibroblast growth factor resulted in the up-regulation of nestin, MAP2, peripherin, and ß-tubulin III and down-regulation of SOX2. The expression of SOX2 and nestin was also confirmed by immunofluorescence. The combination of miR-124 and growth factors would provide a promising starting point for upregulating the neural progenitor markers in human dental pulp stem cells.","Mehri Ghahfarrokhi, Ameneh; Jami, Mohammad Saeid; Hashemzadeh Chaleshtori, Morteza",Int J Mol Cell Med,,247

408184,Stroke Fellow Redeployed: My Fellowship in COVID in the Epicenter of a Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Human parechoviruses are a major cause of CNS infection in neonates and young children. They have been implicated in neurological sequelae and neurodevelopmental delay. However, the magnitude of this effect has not been systematically reviewed or assessed with meta-analyses. We investigated short-term, medium-term, and long-term neurological sequelae and neurodevelopmental delay in neonates and young children after parechovirus-CNS-infection. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analyses of studies, we searched PubMed, Embase, and PsycInfo, from the inception of the database until March 18, 2019, for reviews, systematic reviews, cohort studies, case series, and case control studies reporting on neurological or neurodevelopmental outcomes of children 3 months or younger with parechovirus infection of the CNS. Studies that were published after Dec 31, 2007, assessed children younger than 16 years, detailed parechoviruses infection of the CNS (confirmed by PCR), and followed up on neurological and neurodevelopmental outcomes were included. Studies published before Dec 31, 2007, were excluded. The predefined primary outcomes were the proportions of children with neurological sequelae, impairment in auditory or visual functions, or gross motor function delay. The proportion of children in whom neurological or neurodevelopmental outcomes were reported was pooled in meta-analyses. For each outcome variable we calculated the pooled proportion with 95% CI. The proportion of children in whom neurological or neurodevelopmental outcomes were reported was extracted by one author and checked by another. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the studies. FINDINGS: 20 studies were eligible for quantitative synthesis. The meta-analyses showed an increasing proportion of children with neurological sequelae over time: 5% during short-term follow-up (pooled proportion 0·05 [95% CI 0·03-0·08], I2=0·00%; p=0·83) increasing to 27% during long-term follow-up (0·27 [0·17-0·40], I2=52·74%; p=0·026). The proportion of children with suspected neurodevelopmental delay was 9% or more during long-term follow-up. High heterogeneity and methodological issues in the included studies mean that the results should be interpreted with caution. INTERPRETATION: This systematic review suggests the importance of long follow-up, preferably up to preschool or school age (5-6 years), of children with parechovirus infection of the CNS. Although not clinically severe, we found an increasing proportion of neonates and young children with CNS infection had associated neurological sequelae and neurodevelopmental delay over time. We recommend the use of standardised methods to assess neurological and neurodevelopmental functions of these children and to compare results with age-matched reference groups.

408485,COVID-19 related immune hemolysis and thrombocytopenia,2020,"Once the WHO declared the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic, the world had to reprogram numerous clinical activities, particularly those related to highly disabling diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). In this study, 1083 IBD patients were assessed, affected by Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and subdivided into two groups. The first group included patients who needed treatment in person at the outpatients clinic, while the second group could be tele-monitored because they were able to self-administer therapy. The tele-monitoring was based on telecommunication applications via smartphone, driven by a dedicated clinical control room in the IBD Clinic. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life (using IBDQ32) of UC patients and tele-monitored CD patients (tele-monitoring group) as compared to those patients who underwent assessment in person in the outpatients clinic (control group). Despite observing a lower number of relapses in the control group than the tele-monitoring group, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of the IBD32Q scores. Tele-monitoring of patients who are able to self-administer the IBD therapy can be an effective vicarious system as compared to the clinical evaluation in person, that could lead to important changes to avoid the overcrowding of the IBD outpatients clinic, especially during public health crises like the present pandemic.","Mastronardi, Mauro; Curlo, Margherita; Polignano, Maurizio; Vena, Natalino; Rossi, Daniela; Giannelli, Gianluigi",,,247

Patient medical histories and clinical parameters were evaluated to identify common risk factors including obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Patients presented with increased inflammatory markers including ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as increased D-dimer. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest patients with COVID-19 and comorbidities presenting with elevated inflammatory markers and D-dimer may be at increased risk of large vessel peripheral arterial occlusion.","Ogawa, Makoto; Doo, Florence X; Somwaru, Alexander S; Roudenko, Alexandra; Kamath, Amita; Friedman, Barak",Clin Imaging,,247
409842,Potential adverse drug reactions of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19,2020,"Purpose: The present study analyzed peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) measurements taken on the Garmin fenix® 5X Plus watch, comparing them to measurements taken on a standard medical-grade pulse oximeter during normobaric hypoxia exposure under resting conditions. Methods: Thirteen women (mean ± SD: Age 20 ± 1 years, height 165 ± 5 cm, mass, 67 ± 9 kg) and ten men (mean ± SD: Age 21 ± 3 years, height 177 ± 6 cm, mass 78 ± 11 kg) sat inside a customized environmental chamber while the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) was adjusted to simulate altitudes of 12,000; 10,000; 8,000; 6,000; and 900 ft. The novel commercial device (Garmin fenix®) and a medical-grade pulse oximeter (Nonin® 7500) were used to measure SpO2 and HR in triplicate at each simulated altitude. Bland-Altman analyses were used to assess differences between methods. Results: Bland-Altman analysis indicated 3.3% bias for SpO2 measurements taken on the Garmin fenix® at 12,000 ft of simulated altitude (limits of agreement: -1.9-8.6%). Mean differences in SpO2 measurements were smaller at the remaining simulated altitudes, where bias measurements ranged from 0.7% to 0.8%. The Garmin fenix® also underestimated heart rate, but those discrepancies were minimal (bias measurements at all simulated altitude exposures were < 1.0 bpm). Conclusions: With the exception of readings taken at 12,000 ft of simulated altitude, the Garmin fenix® exhibits minimal overestimation of SpO2 and minimal underestimation of HR during simulated altitude exposure. These data suggest the Garmin fenix® watch may be a viable method to monitor SpO2 and HR under most ambient environmental conditions.","Lauterbach, Claire J; Romano, Phebe A; Greisler, Luke A; Brindle, Richard A; Ford, Kevin R; Kuennen, Matthew R",Res Q Exerc Sport,,247
410128,Psychological Components of Infertility,2021,"Finnish authorities provide undocumented migrants with at least emergency healthcare services, but very few (if any) undocumented migrants use these or other public healthcare services. There are challenges to accessing healthcare, including language, culture or communication, inadequate information, difficult opening times, lack of specialised services, fear of using such services, and lack of networks relating to social and healthcare services. The provision of wider healthcare services and prevention of illnesses is actually less expensive for countries than providing undocumented migrants with only emergency healthcare. This chapter discusses the undocumented migrants’ access to healthcare and their use of healthcare services. The Constitution of Finland guarantees emergency healthcare services for everyone staying in Finland, including undocumented migrants;however, the actual provision of healthcare (emergency or otherwise) for undocumented migrants varies greatly among local municipalities. Furthermore, few migrants use these available services. The majority turn to unofficial services, with some risk for themselves and the local community. The chapter highlights issues regarding the mental and physical health of undocumented migrants, who often suffer from trauma, which is not properly treated. It also discusses the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on undocumented migrants in Finland. © 2021, The Author(s).","Jauhiainen, J. S.; Tedeschi, M.",IMISCOE Research Series,,247

These systems utilize non-traditional smartphone-based technology, presenting challenges in understanding possible outcomes. In this work, we create individual-based models of three Washington state counties to explore how digital exposure notifications combined with other non-pharmaceutical interventions influence COVID-19 disease spread under various adoption, compliance, and mobility scenarios. In a model with 15% participation, we found that exposure notification could reduce infections and deaths by approximately 8% and 6% and could effectively complement traditional contact tracing. We believe this can provide health authorities in Washington state and beyond with guidance on how exposure notification can complement traditional interventions to suppress the spread of COVID-19.","Abueg, Matthew; Hinch, Robert; Wu, Neo; Liu, Luyang; Probert, William; Wu, Austin; Eastham, Paul; Shafi, Yusef; Rosencrantz, Matt; Dikovsky, Michael; Cheng, Zhao; Nurtay, Anel; Abeler-Dörner, Lucie; Bonsall, David; McConnell, Michael V; O039,; Banion, Shawn; Fraser, Christophe",NPJ Digit Med,,247
411405,Overlap of immunotherapy-related pneumonitis and COVID-19 pneumonia: diagnostic and vaccine considerations,2021,"COVID-19 pandemic is caused by betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The genome of this virus is composed of a single strand of RNA with 5' and 3'-UTR flanking a region of protein-coding ORFs closely resembling cells' mRNAs. MicroRNAs are endogenous post-transcriptional regulators that target mRNA to modulate protein expression and mediate cellular functions, including antiviral defense. In the present study, we carried out a bioinformatics screening to search for endogenous human microRNAs targeting the 3'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2. Results from the computational techniques allowed us to identify 10 potential candidates. The capacity of 3 of them, together with hsa-miR-138-5p, to target the SARS-CoV-2 3'-UTR was validated in vitro by gene reporter assays. Available information indicates that two of these microRNAs, namely, hsa-miR-3941 and hsa-miR-138-5p, combine effective targeting of SARS-CoV-2 genome with complementary antiviral or protective effects in the host cells that make them potential candidates for therapeutic treatment of most, if not all, COVID-19 variants known to date.

There are currently no approved medications or vaccines which have been claimed to be effective in COVID-19 prevention or treatment. Drug repurposing of available drugs and research studies for the search of new therapeutic agents are underway in various countries to try different combinations to treat their patients. It is too early to be sure of them as safe treatments because some reports seem to suggest some alarming side effects. However, a lot of work needs to be done to achieve a successful treatment result and the full safety and efficacy of the trial drugs will take some time to be developed.

412227,Sentiment analysis for news and social media in COVID-19,2020,"Objective: Present study investigated the mechanism of heart failure associated with coronavirus infection and predicted potential effective therapeutic drugs against heart failure associated with coronavirus infection. Methods: Coronavirus and heart failure were searched in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and omics data were selected to meet experimental requirements. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the Limma package in R language to screen for differentially expressed genes. The two sets of differential genes were introduced into the R language cluster Profiler package for gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto gene and genome encyclopedia (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Two sets of intersections were taken. A protein interaction network was constructed for all differentially expressed genes using STRING database and core genes were screened. Finally, the apparently accurate treatment prediction platform (EpiMed) independently developed by the team was used to predict the therapeutic drug. Results: The GSE59185 coronavirus data set was searched and screened in the GEO database, and divided into wt group, &#916;E group, &#916;3 group, &#916;5 group according to different subtypes, and compared with control group. After the difference analysis, 191 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes were defined. The GEO126062 heart failure data set was retrieved and screened from the GEO database. A total of 495 differentially expressed genes were screened, of which 165 were up-regulated and 330 were down-regulated. Correlation analysis of differentially expressed genes between coronavirus and heart failure was performed. After cross processing, there were 20 GO entries, which were mainly enriched in virus response, virus defense response, type â interferon response, Î³ interferon regulation, innate immune response regulation, negative regulation of virus life cycle, replication regulation of viral genome, etc. There were 5 KEGG pathways, mainly interacting with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, cytokine and receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, human giant cells viral infection related. All differentially expressed genes were introduced into the STRING online analysis website for protein interaction network analysis, and core genes such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, IL-10, IL17, TNF, interferon regulatory factor 9, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 3, radical s-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2, c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 10, caspase 3 and other genes were screened. The drugs predicted by EpiMed's apparent precision treatment prediction platform for disease-drug association analysis were mainly TNF-&#945; inhibitors, resveratrol, ritonavir, paeony, retinoic acid, forsythia, and houttuynia cordata. Conclusions: The abnormal activation of multiple inflammatory pathways may be the cause of heart failure in patients after coronavirus infection. Resveratrol, ritonavir, retinoic acid, amaranth, forsythia, houttuynia may have therapeutic effects. Future basic and clinical research is warranted to validate present results and hypothesis.","Chen, X M; Cao, F; Zhang, H M; Chen, H R; Zhang, J D; Zhi, P; Li, Z Y; Wang, Y X; Lu, X C",Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi,,247

Here, a charge-reversal surfactant antibiotic material N-dodecyl-1-carboxylic acid-1-cyclohexenyl-2-carboxamide (C12N-DCA) is designed and synthesized. C12N-DCA is a negatively charged surfactant, which cannot be adsorbed by soil and rock in a large amount. Therefore, it can reach the ""lesion location"", with enough concentration. After being hydrolyzed and charge reversed under the acceleration of H2S produced by SRB, C12N-DCA becomes a positively charged surfactant dodecane ammonium salt to kill SRB. Through a simulating experiment, it is found that C12N-DCA can reach the SRB inhibition ratio of almost 100%, and it can reduce iron corrosion by 88%.

415481,COVID-19 Crisis in Romania - Between Perception and Attitude (preprint),2020,"Compressive sensing (CS) provides a potential platform for acquiring slow and sequential data, as in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, CS requires high computational time for reconstructing MR images from sparse k-space data, which restricts its usage for high speed online reconstruction and wireless communications. Another major challenge is removal of Rician noise from magnitude MR images which changes the image characteristics, and thus affects the clinical usefulness. The work carried out so far predominantly models MRI noise as a Gaussian type. The use of advanced noise models primarily Rician type in CS paradigm is less explored. In this work, we develop a novel framework to reconstruct MR images with high speed and visual quality from noisy sparse k-space data. The proposed algorithm employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to denoise MR images corrupted with Rician noise. To extract local features, the algorithm exploits signal similarities by processing similar patches as a group. An imperative reduction in the run time has been achieved as the CNN has been trained on a GPU with Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding framework making it suitable for online reconstruction. The CNN based reconstruction also eliminates the necessity of optimization and prediction of noise level while denoising, which is the major advantage over existing state-of-the-art-techniques. Analytical experiments have been carried out with various undersampling schemes and the experimental results demonstrate high accuracy and consistent peak signal to noise ratio even at 20-fold undersampling. High undersampling rates provide scope for wireless transmission of k-space data and high speed reconstruction provides applicability of our algorithm for remote health monitoring.","Manimala, M V R; Dhanunjaya Naidu, C; Giri Prasad, M N",Wirel Pers Commun,,247

Here, we review recent advancements in RTK structure determination and in the understanding of RTK activation. We argue that further progress in the field will necessitate new ways of thinking, and we introduce the concept that RTK dimers explore ensembles of microstates, each characterized by different kinase domain dimer conformations, but the same extracellular domain dimer structure. Many microstates are phosphorylation-competent and ensure the phosphorylation of one specific tyrosine. The prevalence of each microstate correlates with its stability. A switch in ligand will lead to a switch in the extracellular domain configuration and to a subsequent switch in the ensemble of microstates. This model can explain how different ligands produce specific phosphorylation patterns, how receptor overexpression leads to enhanced signaling even in the absence of activating ligands, and why RTK kinase domain structures have remained unresolved in cryogenic electron microscopy studies.","Karl, Kelly; Hristova, Kalina",Curr Opin Struct Biol,,247

Procedures that have been established to decrease the spread of the virus depend on the careful and precise detection of infected individuals using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). There have been many ambiguous concerns among the public regarding the severity of infection and its connection with the Cycle threshold (Ct) value and there was forceful need to inform the values to the public especially those with symptoms. The main objective of this study was to determine the association between the E (Envelop) gene Ct values of the symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. The study was conducted at the Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL), Jagdalpur, Chhattisgarh. Between March 2020 and June 2020, samples were collected from the Bastar region as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. A total of 29228 clinical samples were tested by qRT-PCR targeting the E and RdRp (RNA-dependant RNA polymerase) genes as well as the ORF (open reading frame) gene that encode polyproteins of SARS-CoV-2. Of the 29228 samples tested, 75 were tested positive and 29153 were tested negative. In addition, the Ct values varied between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. It was observed that, the Ct values ranged from 15 to 32 in the asymptomatic patients and between 13 to 34 in the symptomatic patients. E gene Ct value analysis showed no significant difference between the asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Thus, we observed that there was no association between the Ct values of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients of COVID-19.

418205,Von Willebrand factor (vWF): marker of endothelial damage and thrombotic risk in COVID-19?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Emergence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caught the world off guard and unprepared, initiating a global pandemic. In the absence of evidence, individual communities had to take timely action to reduce the rate of disease spread and avoid overburdening their health care systems. Although a few predictive models have been published to guide these decisions, most have not taken into account spatial differences and have included assumptions that do not match the local realities. Access to reliable information that is adapted to local context is critical for policy makers to make informed decisions during a rapidly evolving pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop an adapted susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina and the Charlotte Metropolitan Region, and to incorporate the effect of a public health intervention to reduce disease spread while accounting for unique regional features and imperfect detection. METHODS: Three SIR models were fit to infection prevalence data from North Carolina and the greater Charlotte Region and then rigorously compared. One of these models (SIR-int) accounted for a stay-at-home intervention and imperfect detection of COVID-19 cases. We computed longitudinal total estimates of the susceptible, infected, and removed compartments of both populations, along with other pandemic characteristics such as the basic reproduction number. RESULTS: Prior to March 26, disease spread was rapid at the pandemic onset with the Charlotte Region doubling time of 2.56 days (95% CI 2.11-3.25) and in North Carolina 2.94 days (95% CI 2.33-4.00). Subsequently, disease spread significantly slowed with doubling times increased in the Charlotte Region to 4.70 days (95% CI 3.77-6.22) and in North Carolina to 4.01 days (95% CI 3.43-4.83). Reflecting spatial differences, this deceleration favored the greater Charlotte Region compared to North Carolina as a whole. A comparison of the efficacy of intervention, defined as 1 - the hazard ratio of infection, gave 0.25 for North Carolina and 0.43 for the Charlotte Region. In addition, early in the pandemic, the initial basic SIR model had good fit to the data; however, as the pandemic and local conditions evolved, the SIR-int model emerged as the model with better fit. CONCLUSIONS: Using local data and continuous attention to model adaptation, our findings have enabled policy makers, public health officials, and health systems to proactively plan capacity and evaluate the impact of a public health intervention. Our SIR-int model for estimated latent prevalence was reasonably flexible, highly accurate, and demonstrated efficacy of a stay-at-home order at both the state and regional level. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating local context into pandemic forecast modeling, as well as the need to remain vigilant and informed by the data as we enter into a critical period of the outbreak.","Turk, Philip J; Chou, Shih-Hsiung; Kowalkowski, Marc A; Palmer, Pooja P; Priem, Jennifer S; Spencer, Melanie D; Taylor, Yhenneko J; McWilliams, Andrew D",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,247

419289,COVID-19 with Cardiovascular Disease: Can It Help Predict Prognosis?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes pulmonary injury or multiple-organ injury by various pathological pathways. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-ß) is a key factor that is released during SARS-CoV-2 infection. TGF-ß, by internalization of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), suppresses the anti-oxidant system, downregulates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and activates the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and nuclear factor-kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB). These changes cause inflammation and lung injury along with coagulopathy. Moreover, reactive oxygen species play a significant role in lung injury, which levels up during SARS-CoV-2 infection. DRUG SUGGESTION: Pirfenidone is an anti-fibrotic drug with an anti-oxidant activity that can prevent lung injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the maturation process of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-ß) and enhancing the protective role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Pirfenidone is a safe drug for patients with hypertension or diabetes and its side effect tolerated well. CONCLUSION: The drug as a theoretical perspective may be an effective and safe choice for suppressing the inflammatory response during COVID-19. The recommendation would be a combination of pirfenidone and N-acetylcysteine to achieve maximum benefit during SARS-CoV-2 treatment.","Hamidi, Seyed Hootan; Kadamboor Veethil, Sandhya; Hamidi, Seyedeh Harir",Pharmacol. rep,,247
419406,DPP4 and ACE2 in Diabetes and COVID-19: Therapeutic Targets for Cardiovascular Complications?,2020,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with the novel, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), transplant medicine also had to face a new, hitherto unknown challenge. To be prepared for any possibility, we consider it important to summarize the current knowledge regarding COVID-19 of liver and kidney transplant patients. Very early reports from Spanish and French registry recorded fatality rates of 18.6% and 13%, respectively, in renal patients which suggests a moderately worse outcome compared to the general population. In patients with positive PCR test but not showing clinical signs, the reduction of immunosuppression is not advised. In the case of gastrointestinal or respiratory signs with fever, the discontinuation of mycophenolate or mTOR inhibitors is recommended with decrease of the trough levels of calcineurin inhibitors to the lowest effective limit. Stop (kidney transplanted patients) or decrease (liver transplanted patients) immunosuppression and maintain corticosteroids when pulmonal injury develops and consider anti-IL1 and anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody use when hyperinflammatory syndrome is evolving. No proven effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 exists currently. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir should be avoided because of the severe drug interaction with calcineurin inhibitors. The efficacy and tolerability of hidroxychloroquin remains to be also questionable; enroll patients into clinical trial with remdesivir or favipiravir if available. COVID-19 is characterized by virus-induced endothelial dysfunction, procoagulant state and renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system imbalance. Early thromboprofilaxis combination with low-molecular-weight heparin and low-dose aspirin is strongly recommended with the maintenance of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin-II-receptor blocker (ARB) therapy when they were prescribed earlier.

419470,Time to COVID-19 RT-PCR clearance among patients with cancer,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The absence of companionship during childbirth is known to be responsible for negative emotional birth experience, which can increase the risk of postpartum depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The context of COVID-19 epidemic and the related confinement could increase the rate of negative experience and mental disorders. The main objective is to compare, in immediate post partum, the maternal sense of control during childbirth between a group of women who gave birth during confinement ('confinement' group) versus a group of women who gave birth after confinement but in the context of epidemic ('epidemic' group) versus a group of control women ('control' group; excluding confinement and epidemic context). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a national multicentre prospective cohort study conducted in four French maternity units. We expect to include 927 women in a period of 16 months. Women will be recruited immediately in post partum during three different periods constituting the three groups: 'confinement'; 'epidemic' and 'control' group. The maternal sense of control will be evaluated by the Labour Agentry Scale questionnaire completed immediately in post partum. Postnatal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), post-traumatic stress disorder (Impact of Event Scale-Revised) and breast feeding (evaluative statement) will be evaluated at 2 months post partum. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the French Ethics Committee, the CPP (Comité de Protection des Personnes) SUD OUEST ET OUTRE-MER IV on 16th of April 2020 with reference number CPP2020-04-040. The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and will be presented at relevant conferences.

419678,A Call to Action: “Low-Dose Radiation May Help Cure COVID-19…” [taps mic] “…Is This Thing On?”,2020,"The coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and the closely related SARS-CoV coronavirus enter cells by binding at the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The stronger hACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 has been connected with its higher infectivity. In this work, we study hACE2 complexes with the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of the human SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV viruses, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and computational protein design with a physics-based energy function. The molecular dynamics simulations identify charge-modifying substitutions between the CoV-2 and CoV RBDs, which either increase or decrease the hACE2 affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The combined effect of these mutations is small, and the relative affinity is mainly determined by substitutions at residues in contact with hACE2. Many of these findings are in line and interpret recent experiments. Our computational protein design calculations redesign positions 455, 493, 494, and 501 of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding motif, which contact hACE2 in the complex and are important for ACE2 recognition. Sampling is enhanced by an adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo method. Sequences with increased affinity replace CoV-2 glutamine by a negative residue at position 493; serine by a nonpolar or aromatic residue or an asparagine at position 494; and asparagine by valine or threonine at position 501. Substitutions at positions 455 and 501 have a smaller effect on affinity. Substitutions suggested by our design are seen in viral sequences encountered in other species, including bat and pangolin. Our results might be used to identify potential virus strains with higher human infectivity and assist in the design of peptide-based or peptidomimetic compounds with the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding at hACE2.","Polydorides, Savvas; Archontis, Georgios",Biophys J,,247
419708,Fatal Post-Infarction Late Left Ventricular Free Wall Rupture in the Era of COVID-19,2020,"Although Italy has been on track for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) elimination since 2019, it fell off track due to the decrease in the number of treated patients. HCV elimination in Italy will be possible if immediate action is taken. A health policy was implemented beginning in 2021, consisting of screening among key populations and birth cohorts (1969-1989), estimated to have a high prevalence of undiagnosed individuals. The active screening requires regional governance that manages the processes' complexity integrating a well-organized network between territory assistance and hospital to achieve an effective HCV care cascade. This document aims to support the regional decision-making process by defining paths for screening and linkage-to-care. Implementing active screening strategies beyond a risk-based approach is required as a General Practitioners' task. Simplified paths must be drawn for the key populations screening. The infrastructure built for COVID-19 vaccination could be used also for HCV screening. According to a multidisciplinary care delivery, screening should be supplemented with rapid linkage-to-care and treatment of newly diagnosed patients. The realization of the proactive screening during the first two years is vital because it will define the tracks for the whole HCV cost-effective screening of 1948-1988 birth cohorts in Italy.","Kondili, L.

419719,Bronchoscopy in children with COVID-19: A case series,2020,"BACKGROUND: Intracranial injury (ICI) from abusive head trauma is the leading cause of death among young abused children but is difficult to detect. Long bone fracture (LBF) may lead to the recognition of abuse in young abused children. OBJECTIVES: This study is the first to report the incidence and features of ICI in children with abuse and LBFs. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of children younger than 3 years with the diagnosis of LBF in the National Trauma Data Bank from 2009 to 2014. LBF, abuse, and clinical features were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Abuse-related LBF with and without ICI were compared to identify risk factors for ICI. RESULTS: There were 4345 encounters for abuse-related LBF in kids ages < 3 years; 970 (22%) had ICI. Infants < 1 year of age were more likely to have ICI compared with older children (odds ratio [OR] 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38-2.33). After adjusting for age, fracture of the ulna, radius, tibia, or fibula were associated with greater odds of ICI (OR 3.35, 95% CI 2.81-4.00). Abuse-related LBF with additional findings of skull fracture, rib fracture, or head/neck bruising had an increased odds of ICI (OR 8.27, 95% CI 6.85-9.98; OR 2.67, 95% CI 2.28-3.14; OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.99-2.92, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: ICI occurred in nearly 1 in 4 children under 3 years old with abuse-related LBF. Abuse-related LBF with skull fracture, rib fracture, head/neck bruising, or patient age < 1 year should prompt consideration for ICI with head imaging.","Chahla, Saydi; Ortega, Henry",J. emerg. med,,247

This tool can contribute to public health surveillance at both community (wastewater treatment system) and institutional (e.g., colleges, prisons, and nursing homes) scales. This paper explores the successes, challenges, and lessons learned from initial wastewater surveillance efforts at colleges and university systems to inform future research, development and implementation. We present the experiences of 25 college and university systems in the United States that monitored campus wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 during the fall 2020 academic period. We describe the broad range of approaches, findings, resources, and impacts from these initial efforts. These institutions range in size, social and political geographies, and include both public and private institutions. Our analysis suggests that wastewater monitoring at colleges requires consideration of local information needs, sewage infrastructure, resources for sampling and analysis, college and community dynamics, approaches to interpretation and communication of results, and follow-up actions. Most colleges reported that a learning process of experimentation, evaluation, and adaptation was key to progress. This process requires ongoing collaboration among diverse stakeholders including decision-makers, researchers, faculty, facilities staff, students, and community members.","Harris-Lovett, Sasha; Nelson, Kara L; Beamer, Paloma; Bischel, Heather N; Bivins, Aaron; Bruder, Andrea; Butler, Caitlyn; Camenisch, Todd D; De Long, Susan K; Karthikeyan, Smruthi; Larsen, David A; Meierdiercks, Katherine; Mouser, Paula J; Pagsuyoin, Sheree; Prasek, Sarah M; Radniecki, Tyler S; Ram, Jeffrey L; Roper, D Keith; Safford, Hannah; Sherchan, Samendra P; Shuster, William; Stalder, Thibault; Wheeler, Robert T; Korfmacher, Katrina Smith",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,247

INTRODUCTION: The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in drastic changes in day-to-day patient care, which has also affected the field of organ donation and transplantation, thus reducing the number of donations and transplants from living and deceased donors worldwide. In addition to the reduction in the number of cases, additional safety measures had to be introduced to protect transplanted and implicatively immunosuppressed patients. METHOD: The aim of the study was to demonstrate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on domestic donation and transplantation activity in 2020, compared to the previous year. We also compared the Hungarian results with the data of the Eurotransplant and the European Union member states. RESULTS: In terms of population-weighted, registered COVID-19 infection and mortality, we did not find a significant difference in Hungary in 2020 compared to the Eurotransplant member states. The national organ donation potential did not diminish in the period under review, however, the number of brain-dead organ donors decreased by 38.33% in Hungary, while in the Eurotransplant it did by 8.64% on average and in 23 reporting European countries by 17.55%. The number of organ transplants from the deceased decreased by 29.27%, especially regarding heart and liver transplants. Both the number and the proportion of organs received from abroad increased by 21.13% and 12.34%, respectively. The number of living donor kidney transplants did not change. In 2020, 25% fewer new patients were registered than in 2019 and the mortality on waiting list increased by 28% compared to the previous year, especially among those waiting for a kidney transplant. CONCLUSION: The national organ transplantation program is safe: donor-derived SARS-CoV-2 transmission did not occur in Hungary. In addition to the organ donation potential and the COVID-19 pandemic, organ donation and transplantation activity decreased significantly in Hungary from March 2020 until the end of the year. Transient and smaller reductions in organ donation rates have been reported in most European countries. The number of organ transplants did not decrease as much as the number of donors, because more donor organs arrived in Hungary from the Eurotransplant than we sent abroad.

Cross-species zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has caused severe pathogenicity and led to more than 655,000 fatalities worldwide until July 28, 2020. Outbursts of this virus underlined the importance of controlling infectious pathogens across international frontiers. Unfortunately, there is currently no clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, although several broad-spectrum antiviral drugs targeting multiple RNA viruses have shown a positive response and improved recovery in patients. In this review, we compile our current knowledge of the emergence, transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and explore several features of SARS-CoV-2. We emphasize the current therapeutic approaches used to treat infected patients. We also highlight the results of in vitro and in vivo data from several studies, which have broadened our knowledge of potential drug candidates for the successful treatment of patients infected with and discuss possible virus and host-based treatment options against SARS-CoV-2.","Patil, Ashwini M; Göthert, Joachim R; Khairnar, Vishal",Cell Physiol Biochem,,247

428216,"Letter by Kwan et al Regarding Article, ""Acute Stroke Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Does Confinement Impact Eligibility for Endovascular Therapy?""",2020,"The novel COVID-19 global pandemic has raised, among many others, major concerns regarding the impact of infection during pregnancy. Current evidence suggests that vertical transmission from mother to baby, antenatally or intrapartum, does occur, but is uncommon. According to the published reports of infants born to COVID-19-affected mothers, as well as the anecdotal experience of current practices worldwide, it appears that investigations regarding the potential of SARS-COV-2 vertical transmission in pregnancy have so far been based, to a large extent, on PCR testing of neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. Given that the transplacental route of intrauterine transmission for SARS-COV-2 is less likely to immediately involve the upper respiratory tract of the newborn, contrary to what happens after birth, it would be advisable to include appropriate biological samples, such as cord blood, placenta, amniotic fluid and neonatal blood, along with the pharyngeal samples, in order to contribute significantly to such investigations. It is important to point out that negative PCR tests of neonatal pharyngeal samples do not exclude the possibility of intrauterine viral transmission, while positive pharyngeal swabs are more likely to reflect intrapartum or postpartum contaminants, rather than antenatal intrauterine transmission, in the absence of other criteria. Revision and enhancement of the so far prevailing practices appear important, in order to facilitate the development of good clinical practice for managing neonates and ensuring safety of families and healthcare providers.","Konstantinidou, Anastasia-E; Skaltsounis, Panagiotis; Eleftheriades, Makarios; Antsaklis, Panagiotis; Charitou, Antonia; Anatolitou, Fani; Moutafi, Athina; Petropoulos, Panagiotis; Daskalakis, George",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,247

As such morbidity and mortality vary significantly around the globe between populations and ethnic groups. Underlying medical conditions and environmental factors contribute higher incidence in some populations and a genetic predisposition may play a role for severe cases with respiratory failure. Here we investigated whether genetic variation in the key genes for viral entry to host cells-ACE2 and TMPRSS2-and sensing of viral genomic RNAs (i.e., TLR3/7/8) could explain the variation in incidence across diverse ethnic groups. Overall, these genes are under strong selection pressure and have very few nonsynonymous variants in all populations. Genetic determinant for the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 does not show significant difference between populations. Non-genetic factors are likely to contribute differential population characteristics affected by COVID-19. Nonetheless, a systematic mutagenesis study on the receptor binding domain of ACE2 is required to understand the difference in host-viral interaction across populations.","Lee, In-Hee; Lee, Ji-Won; Kong, Sek Won",Infect Genet Evol,,247

There is concern regarding performing endonasal surgical procedures because of a high viral load in the nasopharynx. This paper describes our experience in conducting emergency and urgent endonasal operations during the peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the UK. OBJECTIVES: To show the outcome of endonasal surgery during the peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and to assess the post-operative rate of nosocomial coronavirus disease 2019 infection. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of all patients who underwent high priority endoscopic nasal surgery or anterior skull base surgery between 23rd March and 15th June 2020 at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients underwent endonasal surgery during the study period, 12 were males and 12 were females. There was no coronavirus-related morbidity in any patient. CONCLUSION: This observational study found that it is possible to safely undertake urgent endonasal surgery; the nosocomial risk of coronavirus disease 2019 can be mitigated with appropriate peri-operative precautions.","Naik, P P; Tsermoulas, G; Paluzzi, A; McClelland, L; Ahmed, S K",J Laryngol Otol,,247
429287,The Emergence of COVID-19 Associated Mucormycosis: Analysis of Cases From 18 Countries (preprint),2021,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes in Chinese residents' psychological state and its influencing factors after the Wuhan shutdown on 23 Jan. METHODS: Two surveys were conducted on Feb 1-5 and Feb 20-24, separately, using an online self-administrated questionnaire among 3145 and 3814 participants, respectively. Subjective indicators of daily-life changes include level of attention, risk of infection, impact of daily life, self-perceived health status, and mental health help-seeking. And individual scores on changes in anxiety, depression, and stress were generated by 6-item, 4-item, and 3-item questions. A multivariate regression model was fitted in each survey, separately and combined. RESULTS: A total of 6959 residents participated in the study, with 32.78% male and 67.22% female, people living in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province accounted for 25.22% and 18.85%, respectively. One week after the Wuhan shutdown, their anxiety, depression, and stress had all increased. Compared to the 1st survey, the changes in the scores of anxiety, depression, and stress in the 2nd survey were decreased (ß=-1.220, -0.798, and -0.623, all p<0.001). The level of attention, risk of infection, and self-perceived health status tended to be positively associated with the changes in the scores of anxiety, depression, and stress. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that the lives and psychological conditions of residents had undergone negative changes after the Wuhan shutdown, but the measures taken during this period were effective. These results may provide guidance for public health policies in other countries and regions.","Chen, Qi; Li, Mengying; Wang, Yueqing; Zhang, Ling; Tan, Xiaodong",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,247
429446,Beneficial effects of exercise in oncology - MoviS: ‘Movement and Health Beyond Care’,2020,"Commercial formulations of 29 commonly used herbal supplements (HS) and grapefruit juice were evaluated for drug interaction potential via quantification of their CYP3A inhibitory potential in two in vitro experimental models of human small intestine, cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa (CHIM) and cryopreserved human enterocytes (CHE). Two CYP3A substrates were used - in the studies with CHIM, CYP3A activity was quantified via LC/MS-MS quantification of midazolam 1'-hydroxylation while in CHE, luciferin IPA metabolism to luciferin was quantified by luminescence. Upon treatment of CHIM with the estimated lumen concentration of the HS upon each oral administration (manufacturers' recommended dosage dissolved in 200 mL of culture medium), >80% CYP3A inhibition was observed for green tea extract, St. John's wort, valerian root, horehound and grapefruit juice. Less than 50% inhibition was observed for fenugreek, aloe vera, guarana, soy isoflavone, maca, echinacea, spirulina, evening primrose, milk thistle, cranberry, red yeast rice, rhodiola, ginkgo biloba, turmeric, curcumin, white kidney bean,, garlic, cinnamon, saw palmetto berries, panax ginseng, black elderberry, wheat grass juice, flaxseed oil, black cohosh, and ginger root. The results were confirmed in a a dose-response study with HS obtained from three suppliers for the four inhibitory HS (green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, valerian root), and three representative non-inhibitory HS (black cohosh, black elderberry, echinacea). Similar results were obtained with the inhibitory HS in CHE. The results illustrate that CHIM and CHE represent physiologically relevant in vitro experimental models for the evaluation of drug interaction potential of herbal supplements. Significance Statement In vitro evaluation of 29 popular herbal supplements in cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa identified green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, valerian root to have CYP3A inhibitory potential similar to that for grapefruit juice, suggesting their potential to have clinically-significant pharmacokinetic interaction with orally administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates. The results suggest that CHIM can be used for in vitro evaluation of drug interactions involving enteric drug metabolism.","Loretz, Carol; Ho, David David; Alam, Novera; Mitchell, Walter; Li, Albert P",Drug metab. dispos,,247

METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive study was conducted, lasting for 31 months, including the start of the pandemic. Frequency of BD and the use of obstetric emergency services was observed. RESULTS: A direct relationship was observed between the pandemic and a decrease in BD. Although emergency obstetric visits decreased, the frequency of deliveries and cases of PPH remained unchanged. After applying strategies to promote voluntary BD, a very slight increase was observed in the frequency of BD, with a negative indicator persisting between donation and blood demand. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to shortages at BBs. In this context, typical measures to encourage an altruistic attitude toward BD have not had a significant impact. As causes of PPH continue, quality of care may be affected by the current situation at BBs. Governments and institutions must implement new strategies to motivate BD.","Nieto-Calvache, Albaro J; Quintero-Santacruz, Marcela; Macia-Mejía, Carmenza; López-Girón, María C; Vergara-Galliadi, Lina M; Ariza, Fredy",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,,247
430391,Association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak required the significantly increased working time and intensity for health professionals in China, which may cause stress signs. METHODS: From March 2-13 of 2020, 4,618 health professionals in China were included in an anonymous, self-rated online survey regarding their concerns on exposure to the COVID-19 outbreak. The questionnaires consisted of five parts: basic demographic information and epidemiological exposure; occupational and psychological impact; concerns during the episode; coping strategies; and the Huaxi Emotional-Distress Index (HEI). RESULTS: About 24.2% of respondents experienced high levels of anxiety or/and depressive symptoms since the COVID-19 outbreak. Respondents who worried about their physical health and those who had COVID-19 infected friends or close relatives were more likely to have high HEI levels, than those without these characteristics. Further, family relationship was found to have an independent protective effect against high HEI levels. Their main concerns were that their families would not be cared for and that they would not be able to work properly. Compared to respondents with clear emotional problems, those with somewhat hidden emotional issues adopted more positive coping measures. CONCLUSIONS: About a quarter of medical staff experienced psychological problems during the pandemic of COVID-19. The psychological impact of stressful events was related to worrying about their physical health, having close COVID-19 infected acquaintances and family relationship issues. Therefore, the psychological supprot for medical staff fighting in the COVID-19 pandemic may be needed.","Dong, Zai-Quan; Ma, Jing; Hao, Yan-Ni; Shen, Xiao-Ling; Liu, Fang; Gao, Yuan; Zhang, Lan",Eur Psychiatry,,247

430745,Addressing the needs of cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: As the coronavirus disease-2019 global pandemic progresses, screening of antiviral agents effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is urgently needed. In addition, considering the viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2, which peaks early in the illness, and the massive burden of the disease, which may increase in the near future, identifying well-tolerated oral antivirals becomes increasingly important. We examined the in vitro activity of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2, at concentrations which can be used to treat coronavirus-19 patients with little concern of toxicity. METHODS: Lopinavir/ritonavir (7/1.75 µg/mL), hydroxychloroquine base (1 or 2 µg/mL), or a combination thereof were administered 1 hour after the inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 to Vero cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05. We examined cytopathic effects of virus 48 hours after administration of the respective treatments and measured viral loads at three time points (0, 24, and 48 hours post-treatment) by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and compared the results obtained from the different antiviral regimens tested. RESULTS: The severity of cytopathic effects was lower in lopinavir/ritonavir-treated cells, and viral load was significantly reduced in this group compared with the control group (p < 0.001). However, hydroxychloroquine did not show significant inhibitory effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytotoxicity or on viral load at either concentration. CONCLUSION: Lopinavir/ritonavir showed significant inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro at its usual plasma concentration. However, the in vitro antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine at concentrations commonly used in humans was minimal, whether used alone or in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir.","Kang, Chang Kyung; Seong, Moon-Woo; Choi, Su-Jin; Kim, Taek Soo; Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Song, Sang Hoon; Kim, Nam-Joong; Park, Wan Beom; Oh, Myoung-Don",Korean J Intern Med,,247
430914,How are family doctors serving the Hong Kong community during the COVID-19 outbreak? A survey of HKCFP members,2020,"With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence technology, the development of various applied software and studies are actively conducted on detection, classification, and prediction through interdisciplinary convergence and integration. Among them, medical AI has been drawing huge interest and popularity in Computer-Aided Diagnosis, which collects human body signals to predict abnormal symptoms of health, and diagnoses diseases through medical images such as X-ray and CT. Since X-ray and CT in medicine use high-resolution images, they require high specification equipment and huge energy consumption due to high computation in learning and recognition, incurring huge costs to create an environment for operation. Thus, this paper proposes a chest X-ray outlier detection model using dimension reduction and edge detection to solve these issues. The proposed method scans an X-ray image using a window of a certain size, conducts difference imaging of adjacent segment-images, and extracts the edge information in a binary format through the AND operation. To convert the extracted edge, which is visual information, into a series of lines, it is computed in convolution with the detection filter that has a coefficient of 2n and the lines are divided into 16 types. By counting the converted data, a one-dimensional 16-size array per one segment-image is produced, and this reduced data is used as an input to the RNN-based learning model. In addition, the study conducted various experiments based on the COVID-chest X-ray dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. According to the experiment results, the LFA-RNN showed the highest accuracy at 97.5% in the learning calculated through learning, followed by CRNN 96.1%, VGG 96.6%, AlexNet 94.1%, Conv1D 79.4%, and DNN 78.9%.

431296,The compelling arguments for the need of microvascular investigation in COVID-19 critical patients,2020,"BackgroundHigh rates of virus transmission and the presence of variants of concern can affect vaccine effectiveness (VE). Both conditions occur in low-income countries, which primarily use viral vector or inactivated virus vaccine technologies. Such countries conducted few VE analyses, and most lack the power to evaluate effectiveness in subgroups. MethodsThe present retrospective cohort study evaluated the effectiveness of Vaxzevria and CoronaVac vaccines for COVID-19-related infection in 75,919,840 Brazilian vaccinees from January 18 to July 24, 2021. Study outcomes included documented infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19-related hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. We estimated VE using Cox regression adjusted for individual demographic characteristics. ResultsVaccination with Vaxzevria or CoronaVac was effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection and highly effective against hospitalization, ICU admission, and death in individuals up to 79 years. From 80-89 years of age, Vaxzevria led to 89.9%(95CI:87.7-91.7) VE against death versus 67.2%(95CI:63.6-70.5) for CoronaVac. Above 90 years, 65.4%(95CI:46.1-77.8) protection was conferred to Vaxzevria-vaccinated individuals versus 33.6%(95CI:21.9-43.5) in CoronaVac-vaccinated individuals. Furthermore, the post-vaccination daily incidence rate shows a stepwise increase from younger to elder decades of life. ConclusionsVaxzevria demonstrated overall effectiveness against severe COVID-19 up to 89 years and CoronaVac up to 79 years of age. There is a stepwise effectiveness reduction for both vaccines for each decade of life. Our results suggest that individuals aged 80 years or older may benefit from an expedited booster dose. Ongoing evaluations, including any additional vaccines authorized, are crucial to monitoring long-term vaccine effectiveness.","Cerqueira-Silva, Thiago; Oliveira, Vinicius de Araújo; Pescarini, Julia; Júnior, Juracy Bertoldo; Machado, Tales Mota; Flores-Ortiz, Renzo; Penna, Gerson; Ichihara, Maria Yury; Barros, Jacson Venâncio de; Boaventura, Viviane; Barreto, Mauricio L.; Werneck, Guilherme Loureiro; Barral-Netto, Manoel",,,247

However, biomechanical changes in CCMs performed on stable and unstable surfaces have not yet been quantified. RESEARCH QUESTION: Do movement patterns, muscle activity, coordination strategies, knee joint loading and center of mass (CoM) movement differ during a CCM performed on stable and unstable surfaces? METHODS: Motion analysis was used to monitor limb kinematics and surface electromyography to analyze supporting leg muscle activity in sixteen healthy athletes during a single-limb support task involving a cyclic CCM on a stable and unstable surface. Angle-angle plots were used to explore coordination strategies in sagittal movement of the hip and shoulder, while differences in kinematics and muscle activity between stable and unstable conditions were evaluated using dependent t-tests (&#945;-level = 0.05). RESULTS: CCMs on an unstable surface were performed at a slower speed (p < .05), with a more flexed posture of the support knee (p < .05) and ankle (p < .05) and resulted in reduced hip and shoulder movement of the swing limbs (p < .05). Instability increased activation of selected muscles of the ankle and knee (p < .05), resulted in a two-fold increase in the peak knee adduction moment (p < .05), and was accompanied by greater CoM movement (p < .05). Three coordination patterns of the swing limbs observed when performing CCM on a stable surface, which were mostly preserved on the unstable surface. SIGNIFICANCE: Despite adopting several stabilization strategies, CCM undertaken on an unstable surface still evoked greater excursion of the center of mass and, as such, presented a greater challenge to sensorimotor control. Adding instability in form of a swinging platform provides progression of dynamic balance CCM difficulty in an athletic population.","Pohl, Torsten; Brauner, Torsten; Wearing, Scott; Horstmann, Thomas",Gait Posture,,247
433553,COVID-19-Associated Neurological Manifestations: An Emerging Electroencephalographic Literature,2020,"Starting from late 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a once-in-a-century pandemic with deadly consequences, which urgently calls for new treatments, cures, and supporting apparatuses. Recently, because of its positive results in clinical trials, remdesivir was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 through Emergency Use Authorization. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We first constructed the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of SARS-CoV NSP12 RdRp (with a sequence identity of 95.8%). We then built a putative preinsertion binding structure by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp without the RNA template. The putative binding structure was further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting stable preinsertion state of remdesivir appeared to form hydrogen bonds with the RNA template when aligned with the newly solved cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The relative binding free energy between remdesivir and ATP was calculated to be -2.80 ± 0.84 kcal/mol, where remdesivir bound much stronger to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp than the natural substrate ATP. The â¼100-fold improvement in the Kd from remdesivir over ATP indicates an effective replacement of ATP in blocking of the RdRp preinsertion site. Key residues D618, S549, and R555 are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir. These findings suggest that remdesivir can potentially act as a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-chain terminator, effectively stopping its RNA replication, with key residues also identified for future lead optimization and/or drug resistance studies.","Zhang, Leili; Zhou, Ruhong",J Phys Chem B,,247
434180,More Severe Obesity Leads to More Severe COVID-19 in Study,2021,"OBJECTIVE: This study compares the characteristics and place of death of patients with cancer receiving specialist palliative care in acute hospitals with those who do not. METHODS: All patients with incident invasive cancer in Ireland (1994-2016 inclusive), excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, who attended a cancer centre and died in 2016 were identified from cancer registry data. Patients were categorised based on a diagnosis code 'Encounter for palliative care' from linked hospital episode data. Place of death was categorised from death certificate data. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, &#967;2 tests and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of n=4103 decedents identified, 62% had a hospital-based palliative care encounter in the year preceding death. Age (p<0.001), marital status (p=0.017), deprivation index (p<0.001) and health board region (p=0.008) were independent predictors of having a palliative care encounter. Place of death differed by palliative care encounter group: 45% of those with an encounter died in hospital versus 50% without an encounter, 33% vs 16% died in a hospice and 18% vs 28% died at home (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Almost two-thirds of patients with cancer who attended a cancer centre and died in 2016 had a palliative care encounter. They were younger, less likely to be married and more likely to be from deprived areas. Having accounted for sociodemographic factors, there was evidence of regional variation in receiving care. Demographic and clinical factors and the provision of health services in a region need to be considered together when assessing end-of-life care.","Kelly, Maria; O039,; Brien, Katie M; Hannigan, Ailish",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),,247

434295,Free licensing of vaccines to end the COVID-19 crisis,2021,"The outbreak of novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) has spread out globally. If we look back in 1960 when first appearance of the corona virus (CoV) occurred, it was considered non-virulent. Forty-two years later, people became infected with an unknown virus in Guangdong province in China, showing symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), after genomic analysis, CoV was detected but there was also a drastic genomic change in between SARS-CoV and CoV that was found in 1960. Thereafter, it broke out again in 2012 as the (MERS-CoV) and 2019 (2019-nCoV). These genomic transformations are associated with mutation which favors the CoV for evolution and with better adaptation employing hijacking targeted host cells more appropriately towards faster transcription and replication, and infect human by transmission through direct or indirect contact of the infected individuals through inhaling droplets originated by coughing or sneezing in infected people. CoV starts replicating by a new host thus, the potential cause of the genomic transformation of each new CoV-strain is the better adaptation and higher virulence. In this regards the latest strain of severe acute deficiency syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) could be more fatal. For proper understanding, in this review, we implicated how CoV binds to host receptors, and we provide brief introduction of the mutation, replication, transmission and pathogenicity of this virus. All of these stages of coronavirus are very essential for their unique evolution.","Roy, Debmalya; Khanra, Ipshita; Wang, Zeling; Merugu, Siva Bharath; Yunus, Fakhar-Un-Nisa; Mashausi, Dhahiri Saidi; Li, Dawei",Curr. pharm. des,,247

We aimed to identify patterns of substance use among MOUD patients and examine whether COVID-19-related impacts on access to healthcare varied across subgroups. METHODS: This analysis was embedded within a type 3 hybrid trial that enrolled patients across eight OTPs at the start of the pandemic. Enrolled patients reported on past-30 day use of multiple substances during their baseline assessment. Participants re-contacted in May-July 2020 completed a survey about COVID-19-related impacts on various life domains. Using latent class analysis we identified patient subgroups, and then examined group differences on a set of negative and positive COVID-19 impacts related to healthcare access. RESULTS: Of the 188 trial participants, 135 (72 %) completed the survey. Latent class analysis identified three MOUD patient subgroups: minimal use (class probability: 0.25); opioid use (class probability: 0.34); and polysubstance use (class probability: 0.41). Compared to the minimal use group, the polysubstance use group reported increased substance use and difficulty accessing sterile needles, naloxone, and preferred substance. The opioid use group reported increased substance use and difficulty accessing their preferred substance. There were no significant group differences related to accessing routine or specialized healthcare or medication; or paying attention to their health. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, many MOUD patients reported challenges accessing care, particularly harm reduction services for patients with polysubstance use. Additional efforts, like providing wraparound support, may be necessary to serve the needs of MOUD patients.","Jacka, Brendan P; Janssen, Tim; Garner, Bryan R; Yermash, Julia; Yap, Kimberly R; Ball, Elizabeth L; Hartzler, Bryan; Becker, Sara J",Drug Alcohol Depend,,247

This study aimed to evaluate the safety of elective colorectal surgery during the pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional, single-center study. Patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic between March 10 and September 9, 2020, were included. Patient data on sex, age, diagnosis, types of procedures, hospital stay, mortality, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) preoperative screening tests were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 103 colorectal surgical procedures were planned, and 99 were performed. Four surgeries were postponed due to positive preoperative screening for SARS-CoV-2. Surgical procedures were performed for colorectal cancer (n=90) and inflammatory bowel disease (n=9). Laparoscopy was the approach of choice for 43 patients (43.4%), 53 (53.5%) procedures were open, and 3 (3%) procedures were robotic. Five patients developed COVID-19 in the postoperative period, and three of them died in the intensive care unit (n=3/5, 60% mortality). Two other patients died due to surgical complications unrelated to COVID-19 (n=2/94, 2.1% mortality) (p&lt;0.01). Hospital stay was longer in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection than in those without (38.4 versushttps://doi.org/10.3 days, respectively, p&lt;0.01). Of the 99 patients who received surgical care during the pandemic, 94 were safely discharged (95%). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that elective colorectal surgical procedures may be safely performed during the pandemic; however, preoperative testing should be performed to reduce in-hospital infection rates, since the mortality rate due to SARS-CoV-2 in this setting is particularly high.","Sobrado, Lucas Faraco; Nahas, Caio Sergio Rizkallah; Marques, Carlos Frederico Sparapan; Cotti, Guilherme Cutait de Castro; Imperiale, Antônio Rocco; Averbach, Pedro; Meira Júnior, José Donizeti de; Horvat, Natally; Ribeiro-Júnior, Ulysses; Cecconello, Ivan; Nahas, Sergio Carlos",Clinics,,247

This article discusses the legality and constitutionality of such a policy. First, it analyzes the laws, regulations, and Supreme Court decisions that provide for the possibility of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination. Subsequently, it analyzes the constitutionality of a mandatory vaccination policy through the proportionality method to address the conflict between, on one side, the right to individual autonomy, which includes the right to refuse a medical intervention, and, on the other, health policies that interfere with individual autonomy to protect the rights to life and health. The application of this method allows for the identification of key questions that need to be answered to determine the constitutionality of a mandatory vaccination program. These questions cannot be answered a priori and in the abstract because they depend on the concrete circumstances of the pandemic, on the characteristics of the vaccine(s) against COVID-19, and on how a mandatory vaccination policy might be designed and implemented by authorities. © 2021 Wang, Moribe, and Arruda.","Wang, D.

437493,"Education Crisis, Workforce Preparedness, and COVID-19: Reflections and Recommendations",2021,"Capsular injuries can occur during multiple shoulder dislocations. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the location and magnitude of glenohumeral capsular injury following multiple dislocations. We hypothesized that the magnitude of capsular injury would increase and the location of peak injury would vary depending on the number of dislocations. Seven fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were used. A 7 × 11 grid of strain markers was affixed to the anteroinferior capsule. Each joint was then mounted to a six degree-freedom robotic testing system. Marker tracking was performed following 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 dislocations to determine the nonrecoverable strain as capsular injury. Following each dislocation, the magnitude of the maximum principal strain representing the nonrecoverable strain in the inferior glenohumeral capsule was quantified by comparing the strain marker positions following each dislocation. The peak value of nonrecoverable strain statistically increased with the number of dislocations in five of seven specimens (p = .0007). The capsular location that had the peak value of nonrecoverable strain varied according to the number of dislocations, and from specimen to specimen. The nonrecoverable strain was identified in the posterior capsule and anterior axillary pouch, which increased with the number of dislocations compared to the other regions of the capsule (p = .001-.012) by up to 16%. Clinical significance: While plication of the anterior axillary pouch is important following multiple dislocations, a more extensive anterior capsular shift may be necessary with an increased number of dislocations in addition to a posterior capsular shift when appropriate.","Yoshida, Masahito; Takenaga, Tetsuya; Chan, Calvin K; Musahl, Volker; Debski, Richard E; Lin, Albert",J. orthop. res,,247

Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics may be justified as we are trying to treat a novel disease condition, which in turn could lead to an increase in antimicrobial resistance. We can decrease morbidity, mortality, and health care costs by controlling antimicrobial resistance, but it requires antimicrobial stewardship. Major components of effective and timely antimicrobial stewardship are diagnostic stewardship, infection prevention and control, and integration of COVID-19 specific flags into electronic health records, all of which may be integrated into current strategies of COVID-19 mitigation and management. Going through the influenza season of 2020, implementation of antimicrobial stewardship education efforts in the United States can help us contend with influenza in addition to COVID-19 and any bacterial co-infections or secondary infections. Additional solutions include the development of vaccines, alternative therapies such as antibodies, and advanced diagnostics using advances in genomics and computer science.","Mayi, B.

The ability to develop improved therapeutic approaches for POP patients is hampered by low patient recruitment and retention rates in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to explore the motivational factors and barriers to recruitment and participation in clinical trials among postmenopausal women with POP who are intending to have surgical management. DESIGN: Qualitative study based on in-depth face-to-face interviews with postmenopausal women attending urogynaecology clinics in the UK intending to have surgical management for pelvic organ prolapse. These women were eligible to participate in the on-going clinical trial on the use of local vaginal oestrogen as an adjunct to surgical treatment. Twenty-two postmenopausal women aged 52-76 years were interviewed. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis method. RESULTS: Many women participated because of altruistic motivations; however, we found that clarity of information provided, timing of approach and acceptability of study design played a pivotal role in women. Of the women who declined participation, the following themes emerged: uncertainty of the investigational product, fear of experimentation, logistical concerns and regret that their condition was trivialised at an early stage. CONCLUSION: We have gained a valuable insight into women's views and experience in the decision making process. Understanding the elements that will enhance trial participation such as clarity of information provided, balance between professional guidance whilst maintaining equipoise, easy access to trial teams and timing of approach will ultimately enable us to improve our recruitment to clinical trials.","Verghese, Tina Sara; Merriel, Abigail; Leighton, Lisa; Latthe, Pallavi",Int. urogynecol. j.

Speculation is rife about the impact of the crisis on employees. Countries and organizations worldwide have categorized some work as essential and, by extension, other work as nonessential. This study aims to investigate the impact of the pandemic by examining the relationship between work disruptions (at time 1) and general distress (at time 2) through various work stressors, contrasting the experiences of employees in essential versus nonessential work. For employees with essential jobs, there is a significant indirect effect of work disruptions on general distress through hindrance stressors. This relationship is not found for employees with nonessential jobs. The general distress of these employees is more strongly affected by disruptions through social stressors (here, social isolation). Hence, this study demonstrates how general distress is affected in different ways for employees conducting essential work and those conducting nonessential work. We further highlight the importance of considering social stressors in this relationship, especially for nonessential work. Organizational change communication quality mitigates the relationship between isolation and general distress for employees with nonessential jobs, but not for those with essential jobs.","van Zoonen, Ward; Ter Hoeven, Claartje L",J Bus Psychol,,247

This pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2) has infected globally with 1,550,000 plus deaths to date, representing a high risk to public health. No effective drug or vaccine is available to curb down this deadly virus. The expedition for searching for a potential drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is of massive potential and favour to the community. This study is focused on finding an effective natural compound that can be processed further into a potential inhibitor to check the activity of SARS-CoV-2 with minimal side effects targeting NSP15 protein, which belongs to the EndoU enzyme family. The natural screening suggested two efficient compounds (PubChem ID: 95372568 and 1776037) with dihydroxyphenyl region of the compound, found to be important in the interaction with the viral protein showing promising activity which may act as a potent lead inhibitory molecule against the virus. In combination with virtual screening, modelling, drug likeliness, molecular docking, and 500 ns cumulative molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns for each complex) along with the decomposition analysis to calculate and confirm the stability and fold, we propose 95372568 and 1776037 as novel compounds of natural origin capable of getting developed into potent lead molecules against SARS-CoV-2 target protein NSP15.","Motwalli, Olaa; Alazmi, Meshari",J Mol Model,,247

However, many years can pass for genomic discoveries to reflect back and benefit the patients. DNA sequencing represents a less biased approach to diagnostics. It is not only a diagnostic tool, but can also influence clinical management and therapy. As new technologies rapidly emerge it is important for researchers and health professionals to have basic knowledge about the capabilities and drawbacks of the existing sequencing methods, and their use in clinical setting and research.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of an interactive anesthesiology educational program on the wellness of anesthesia providers and their children, as assessed by a modified Professional Fulfillment Index. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Perioperative area. PATIENTS: Thirty clinicians participated in the program. Twenty respondents, representing 67% of participants and each corresponding to a parent and their child or children, completed the post-event survey. INTERVENTIONS: An interactive anesthesiology educational program incorporating children, between the ages of five and eighteen years old, of anesthesia providers was held in the perioperative area. The program was held over four hours and was comprised of four sessions including pediatric anesthesia, neuroanesthesia, airway, and ultrasound stations. MEASUREMENTS: Anesthesia providers and their children were administered a post-event assessment, including a modified Professional Fulfillment Index and satisfaction survey. MAIN RESULTS: All twenty (100%) of respondents indicated it was ""very true"" or ""completely true"" that their child was happy with the program, and that it was worthwhile and satisfying to both the anesthesia provider and their child. Nineteen (95%) of reporting participants indicated it was ""very true"" or ""completely true"" that it was meaningful to have the department host such a program and 17 (85%) respondents felt their child now better understands the anesthesia work of the parent. All clinician volunteers indicated it was ""very true"" or ""completely true"" that they were contributing professionally during the program in ways that they valued most. CONCLUSION: An interactive educational wellness initiative provides an effective and feasible method for increasing professional fulfillment and satisfaction among anesthesia providers while educating our youngest generation of learners. Implementation of such a program may also occur with modifications such as televideo to maintain COVID-19 precautions.","Jung, Michael J; Libaw, Justin S; Manuel, Solmaz P; Kathiriya, Irfan S; Srejic, Una; Gandhi, Seema",J Clin Anesth,,247

METHODS: The data of all adult patients (over 18 years of age) who were admitted into a state hospital with confirmed COVID-19 between May 1, 2020 and October 31, 2020 were retrospectively examined. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, known as the area under the curve (AUC), was used to assess the BCRSS prediction rule and the qCSI score to assess the discriminatory power in predicting in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: There were 341 patients included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 58.2 ± 17.2, of which 165 were men and 176 were women, and 61.3% of patients had at least one comorbidity. The most common comorbidity was hypertension. The predictive power scores of BCRSS and qCSI were found as very good in terms of in-hospital mortality (AUC 0.804 and 0.847, respectively) and likewise in terms of ICU admission (AUC 0.842 and 0.851, respectively).

445191,[COVID-19-associated deaths],2021,"&nbsp; INTRODUCTION: Complex drug management is a common challenge in the treatment of geriatric patients. Pandemic scenarios, such as the current one (COVID-19), call for a reduction of face-to-face meetings, especially for elderly patients. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the innovative concept of applying telemedical assessment to geriatric patients in the emergency department (ED) with ED standard treatment. The therapeutic recommendations regarding drug management from the two assessments were compared. A special focus was the use of potentially inadequate drugs (PIMs) for geriatric patients according to the &ldquo;Fit for the Aged&rdquo; (FORTA) classification. METHODS: 50 patients (40% female) aged &ge;70 years and assessed with an Identification of Seniors at Risk Score (ISAR score) of &ge;2 admitted to the ED were prospectively enrolled in this study between November 2017 and February 2018. In addition to the standard treatment in the ED, co-evaluation via video transmission was independently carried out by a board-certified geriatrician. Drug recommendations by ED physicians (A) and the geriatrician (B) were compared. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher frequency of recommendations regarding changes to preexisting medication (p &lt;0.001, n = 50) via geriatric telemedicine in comparison with standard ED treatment. The geriatrician intervened significantly more often than the ED physicians: discontinuation of a drug, p &lt;0.001; start of a new drug, p = 0.004; dose change of a drug, p = 0.001; n = 50). Based on the additional therapy recommendations of the geriatrician, the amount of medication taken by the patient was significantly reduced compared with standard ED treatment (ED assessment t(49) = 0.622 vs geriatrician&rsquo;s assessment t(49) = 4.165; p &lt;0.001; n = 50). Additionally, the number of PIMs was significantly reduced compared with standard medical treatment (p &lt;0.001). The geriatrician changed 53.9% of the drugs (35/65) whereas the ED physicians changed only 12.3% (8/65). Recommendations for immediate drug therapy, however, were made more frequently by ED physicians (p &lt;0.039, n = 50). DISCUSSION: An early assessment of elderly emergency patients by a geriatrician had a significant impact on the number of drug interventions in the ED. The number of PIMs could be significantly reduced. Whether this also has a positive effect on the further inpatient course needs to be investigated in further prospective studies. The study was retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04148027). &nbsp.","Matz, Oliver; Villa, Luigi; Lecce, Chiara; Olaciregui Dague, Karmele; Haeger, Alexa; Bollheimer, Leo Cornelius; Laurentius, Thea; Rossaint, Rolf; Brokmann, Jörg",Swiss Med Wkly,,247

445615,COVID-19: the physician's response in the first phase,2020,"Emerging studies increasingly demonstrate the importance of the throat and salivary glands as sites of virus replication and transmission in early COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, characterized by an outer lipid membrane derived from the host cell from which it buds. While it is highly sensitive to agents that disrupt lipid biomembranes, there has been no discussion about the potential role of oral rinsing in preventing transmission. Here, we review known mechanisms of viral lipid membrane disruption by widely available dental mouthwash components that include ethanol, chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, and povidone-iodine. We also assess existing formulations for their potential ability to disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 lipid envelope, based on their concentrations of these agents, and conclude that several deserve clinical evaluation. We highlight that already published research on other enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, directly supports the idea that oral rinsing should be considered as a potential way to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Research to test this could include evaluating existing or specifically tailored new formulations in well-designed viral inactivation assays, then in clinical trials. Population-based interventions could be undertaken with available mouthwashes, with active monitoring of outcome to determine efficacy. This is an under-researched area of major clinical need.","O039,; Donnell, Valerie B; Thomas, David; Stanton, Richard; Maillard, Jean-Yves; Murphy, Robert C; Jones, Simon A; Humphreys, Ian; Wakelam, Michael J O; Fegan, Christopher; Wise, Matt P; Bosch, Albert; Sattar, Syed A",Function (Oxf),,247

447585,The pivotal role of the angiotensin-II-NF-κB axis in the development of COVID-19 pathophysiology,2020,"Objectives This study examined the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the physical activity (PA) of UK adults and potential motivational determinants of such behaviour. Design and methods A survey was conducted with 1,521 UK adults recruited through Prolific.co in early June 2020. Along with demographic information, questions assessed current PA, changes in PA modalities (i.e., overall, around the home, for transport, in the workplace, in the local neighbourhood, at recreation/sport facilities) related to the lockdown, and beliefs about capabilities, opportunities, and motivations according to the COM-B model. A series of logistic regressions were constructed to examine associations between shifts in the PA modalities and the COM-B components. Results The majority of respondents (57%) had either maintained or increased their levels of PA during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, the proportion meeting PA guidelines (31%) was low and engagement in sedentary-related behaviour for both work and leisure increased substantially during the lockdown. The components of the COM-B model were associated with shifts in PA. In particular, physical opportunity (odds ratios ranging from 1.14 to 1.20) and reflective motivation (odds ratios ranging from 1.11 to 1.25) appeared to be the most consistent predictors of behaviour. Conclusions If UK adults believed they had the physical opportunity and were motivated, they were more likely to have maintained or increased their PA during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, the majority of adults are not meeting the UK guidelines on PA and the prevalence of PA is substantially lower than national surveys prior to the pandemic. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the daily routines of citizens globally. Engagement in physical activity appears to have declined as a result of the requirement to self-isolate and stay in place. The COM-B model of behaviour change is a useful framework for identifying the correlates and determinants of behaviour. What does this study add? Though most UK adults maintained or increased their engagement in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority did not meet recommended guidelines. Reflective processes and physical opportunity were the primary predictors of change in physical activity.","Spence, John C; Rhodes, Ryan E; McCurdy, Ashley; Mangan, Amie; Hopkins, Debbie; Mummery, W Kerry",Br. j. health psychol,,247

METHODS: Direct and indirect risks were defined as (a) vertical infection (congenital or intrapartum), (b) maternal infection and its sequelae, and (c) sources of maternal stress during lockdown, including social isolation and altered healthcare provision. RESULTS: Early studies suggest that vertical viral transmission is low; however, there may be an important effect of maternal infection on foetal growth and development. The impact of various degrees of lockdown on prospective mothers' health, habits and healthcare provision is of concern. In particular, increased maternal stress has been shown to have a significant effect on foetal brain development increasing the risk of mental health, and cognitive and behavioural disorders in later life. CONCLUSION: From the evidence available to date, direct risks to the foetus from the SARS-CoV-2 virus are low. Indirect effects of the pandemic, particularly resulting from the effect of maternal stress on the developing brain, can have lifelong detrimental impacts for this generation of children.","Iqbal, Aysha; Burrin, Charlotte; Aydin, Ezra; Beardsall, Kathryn; Wong, Hilary; Austin, Topun",Acta paediatr. scand,,247

The timing and content of the policy response as well as different possible explanations for what happened are considered. Undertaking a forensic analysis of policy in regard to the overall plan, monitoring and protection as well as funding and resources, the first part lays bare the slow, late and inadequate response to the risk and reality of COVID-19 in care homes as against that in the National Health Service (NHS). A two-pronged, multidimensional explanation is offered: structural, sectoral specificities; political and socio-cultural factors. Amongst the relevant structural factors are the institutionalised separation from the health system, the complex system of provision and policy for adult social care, widespread market dependence. There is also the fact that logistical difficulties were exacerbated by years of austerity and resource cutting and a weak regulatory tradition of the care home sector. The effects of a series of political and cultural factors are also highlighted. As well as little mobilisation of the sector and low public commitment to and knowledge of social care, there is a pattern of Conservative government trying to divest the state of responsibilities in social care. This would support an interpretation in terms of policy avoidance as well as a possible political calculation by government that its policies towards the care sector and care homes would be less important and politically damaging than those for the NHS.","Daly, Mary",Social policy &amp; administration,,247

448574,Hemostatic Abnormalities in COVID-19: An Update,2020,"Following the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) and using only PCR for diagnosis, antibody tests have been rapidly developed by various commercial companies. There are differences between the sensitivity and specificity of these tests due to the usage of different viral target proteins and antibody subclasses. In order to evaluate the diagnostic use of these tests, we aimed to examine the diagnostic performance, especially sensitivity and specificity, of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgA and IgG tests of various companies (Abbott, Roche, Euroimmun, Dia.Pro, Anshlabs, Vircell, UnScience and RedCell), which have different principles (ECLIA/CLIA, EIA, LFA). Current (n= 180) and past (n= 180) COVID-19 patients with clinical and molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine Hospital, Pandemic Polyclinic with suspected COVID-19 infection, were included in our study. The patients admitted within the first 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms were included in the current patient group, and those admitted at the third and after the third week were included in the past patient group. Serum samples (n= 180) obtained from Istanbul Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital, Blood Center between April and June 2018 before the COVID-19 pandemic were included in the study as a control group. All the tests included in our study were studied with the recommendations of the manufacturer companies. Between the IgG detection tests with different principles in patients with past COVID-19, the sensitivity and specificity values of the most effective tests were; 86.7%/99.4% (Abbott), 86.1%/98.9% (Dia.Pro), 91.3%/95% (RedCell). Between the IgM detection tests with different principles in current COVID-19 patients, the sensitivity and specificity values were; 67.8%/99.4% (Abbott), 68.9%/98.6% (Vircell), 50%/97.5% (RedCell). Abbott IgM with a kappa coefficient of 0.67 and Vircell IgM + IgA test with a kappa coefficient of 0.65 showed the best fit in patients with current COVID-19 infection. In patients with past COVID-19, Abbott IgG with 0.86 kappa coefficient and Dia.Pro IgG test with 0.85 kappa coefficient showed the best match. Due to the low sensitivity of IgM detection antibody tests, they should not be preferred instead of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in routine diagnosis.

In this work, a highly reactive BiOCl decahedron photocatalyst with an exposed (001) facet was successfully hydrothermally synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method using bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) as raw materials. By adjusting the dosage of NH4Cl, the BiOCl nanoplates transformed from hexahedra with quadrilateral {110} oblique facets to decahedra with octagonal {110} and {100} oblique facets. As compared to the original BiOCl nanoplates, decahedral BiOCl possesses much more oxygen-enriched surfaces and a narrowed bandgap, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performance. The decahedral BiOCl photocatalyst achieves a high degradability of 98% for the photodegradation of RhB after 6 min of irradiation, which is much faster than that of a hexahedral BiOCl sample.","Bao, Liang; Yuan, Yong-Jun",,,247

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to iteratively devise protocols and processes that minimized HCW exposure while safely and effectively caring for children who may require unanticipated aerosol-generating procedures. METHODS: As part of our PED's initiative to optimize clinical care and HCW safety during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, regular multidisciplinary systems and process simulation sessions were conducted. These sessions allowed us to evaluate and reorganize patient flow, test and improve communication modalities, alter the process for consultation in resuscitations, and teach and reinforce the appropriate donning and use of personal protective equipment. RESULTS: Simulation was a highly effective method to disseminate new practices to PED staff. Numerous workflow modifications were implemented as a result of our in situ systems and process simulations. Total number of persons in the resuscitation room was minimized, use of a ""command post"" with remote providers was initiated, communication devices and strategies were trialed and adopted, and personal protective equipment standards that optimized HCW safety and communication were enacted. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation can be an effective and agile tool in restructuring patient workflow and care of the most critically ill or injured patients in a PED during a novel pandemic.","Lavoie, Megan E; Tay, Khoon-Yen; Good, Grace; Buchhalter, Lillian; Abbadessa, Mary Kate; Gaines, Shannon; Myers, Sage",Pediatr Emerg Care,,247

Case presentation: A 61-year-old male living outside Metro Manila presented with painful mass in his left distal arm during the enhanced community quarantine, and requested admission upon testing negative for COVID-19. Imaging studies suggested a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma involving the radial nerve and humerus, and intending to prevent nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2infection of patient, treatment was expedited by foregoing biopsy and opting for intraoperative frozen section prior to resection. Frozen section findings suggested malignancy intraoperatively, and surgical team proceeded with wide tumour resection and frozen autograft reconstruction of the humerus using plates and screws. However, permanent sections revealed metastatic carcinoma from primary non-small cell lung cancer, with positron emission tomography (PET) scan confirming lung mass in the right apical lobe. Conclusion: The report concludes that establishment of a definite tumour diagnosis by final histopathological analysis is indispensable, even when planning for emergent surgery in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Casas, M.

452744,Role of ACE2 glycosylation and rho kinase inhibition in the infectious/therapeutic process of COVID-19. insights from gitelman's and bartter's syndromes patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus termed SARS-CoV-2, has spread quickly worldwide. Convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from patients following recovery from COVID-19 infection and development of antibodies against the virus is an attractive option for either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment, since antibodies may have direct or indirect antiviral activities and immunotherapy has proven effective in principle and in many clinical reports. OBJECTIVE: We seek to characterize the latest advances and evidence in the use of CP for COVID-19 through a systematic review and quantitative analysis, identify knowledge gaps in this setting, and offer recommendations and directives for future research. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were continuously searched for studies assessing the use of CP for COVID-19, including clinical studies, commentaries, reviews, guidelines or protocols, and in vitro testing of CP antibodies. The screening process and data extraction were performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Quality appraisal of all clinical studies was conducted using a universal tool independent of study designs. A meta-analysis of case-control and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Substantial literature has been published covering various aspects of CP therapy for COVID-19. Of the references included in this review, a total of 243 eligible studies including 64 clinical studies, 79 commentary articles, 46 reviews, 19 guidance and protocols, and 35 in vitro testing of CP antibodies matched the criteria. Positive results have been mostly observed so far when using CP for the treatment of COVID-19. There were remarkable heterogeneities in the CP therapy with respect to patient demographics, donor antibody titers, and time and dose of CP administration. The studies assessing the safety of CP treatment reported low incidence of adverse events. Most clinical studies, in particular case reports and case series, had poor quality. Only 1 RCT was of high quality. Randomized and nonrandomized data were found in 2 and 11 studies, respectively, and were included for meta-analysis, suggesting that CP could reduce mortality and increase viral clearance. Despite promising pilot studies, the benefits of CP treatment can only be clearly established through carefully designed RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: There is developing support for CP therapy, particularly for patients who are critically ill or mechanically ventilated and resistant to antivirals and supportive care. These studies provide important lessons that should inform the planning of well-designed RCTs to generate more robust knowledge for the efficacy of CP in patients with COVID-19. Future research is necessary to fill the knowledge gap regarding prevention and treatment for patients with COVID-19 with CP while other therapeutics are being developed.","Peng, Henry T; Rhind, Shawn G; Beckett, Andrew",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,247

An outpatient rapid molecular sputum test (RMT) performed on March 20, 2020 revealed positivity for M. tuberculosis with rifampicin resistance (R). The therapy established at the time was capreomycin (CM), ethambutol (E), levofloxacin (Lvx), pyrazinamide (P), and terizidone (Tzd). After hospitalisation, his general condition progressively decreased. A reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on April 9, 2020 was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient developed viral bronchopneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, septic shock with pulmonary focus, and respiratory and renal failure. He required orotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, and mechanical ventilation in the prone position. Anti-tuberculosis and antimicrobial therapy was maintained. The patient remains hospitalised for tuberculosis treatment. TB is the largest cause of death due to a single infectious agent, accounting for 1.5 million deaths in 2018 and approximately 4,000 deaths per day. Similar to SARS-CoV-2, TB undergoes direct airborne transmission and is considered a social disease. Its incidence increases or decreases according to socioeconomic and/or social protection measures. Risk factors such as older age, malnutrition, diabetes, agglomeration, social vulnerability, and signs and symptoms such as cough, fever, asthenia, and myalgia are common to both pathologies and may confound and/or delay the diagnosis of COVID/TB co-infections, thus increasing virus and/or bacillus dissemination. The patient had risk factors for both infections, besides structural pulmonary parenchyma involvement (X-ray), which may explain the viral infection severity, progression to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and need for mechanical ventilation Brazil is the ninth largest economy in the world. Meanwhile, 20% of the population remains in poverty. It is estimated that 12 million people live agglomerated in communities (shanty towns) without basic sanitation. This combination of factors may facilitate COVID-19/TB co-infection and increase the number of TB cases and deaths. In summary, health services, including those that diagnose and treat TB and lung diseases, may receive patients with COVID-19, many of whom have not been previously diagnosed. The consequences of co-infection are remaining unexplored. Patients will need close follow-up to assess possible late respiratory and systemic repercussions. Furthermore, effective public power and health system actions will be necessary for the most vulnerable populations to avoid cases as serious as the one presented here.","Arbex, M. A.; Porto, C. L.

The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of reported associations between inter-individual immunogenic variants and disease susceptibility or symptoms caused by the coronavirus strains severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2, and two of the main respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. The results suggest that the genetic background of the host could affect the levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and might modulate the progression of Covid-19 in affected patients. Notably, genetic variations in innate immune components such as toll-like receptors and mannose-binding lectin 2 play critical roles in the ability of the immune system to recognize coronavirus and initiate an early immune response to clear the virus and prevent the development of severe symptoms. This review provides promising clues related to the potential benefits of using immunotherapy and immune modulation for respiratory infectious disease treatment in a personalized manner.","Darbeheshti, Farzaneh; Mahdiannasser, Mojdeh; Uhal, Bruce D; Ogino, Shuji; Gupta, Sudhir; Rezaei, Nima",Rev Med Virol,,247
455297,Proning Patients With COVID-19: A Review of Equipment and Methods,2020,"The concept ""cloud technology"" in the context of pedagogical management has been revealed in the article. It has been found that cloud technologies are relevant in education, are intensively integrated into general secondary education, constitute the basis for the formation of information and educational space of an educational institution, are indispensable during the COVID-19 national quarantine. Considering the cloud environment as an environment of effective pedagogical management, the principles on the basis of which cloud technologies of educational institution management are implemented have been determined. It has been revealed that the use of cloud technologies enables the head of the general secondary education institution to fully realize the main functions and directions of pedagogical management. The main modern processes in the cloud environment have been outlined (digitalization, feedback, collaboration, delegation of powers, crowdsourcing, strategic planning, educational benchmarking, joint planning, management of professional development of teachers, PR-activities of educational institutions, control, monitoring, evaluation, testing online). The powerful capabilities of Google's cloud services in terms of management of teachers and educational institutions in general have been analyzed. Diagnosis has been carried out to determine the state and level of awareness of the possibilities of implementing effective pedagogical management through cloud services. Principals of general secondary education institutions from two regions of Ukraine were involved. The study was conducted in three stages: before COVID-19 quarantine, during the full lockdown and during the adaptive quarantine. As a result of the diagnosis, we have identified three levels of formation of information and digital competence of the principal of an educational institution in the context of the implementation of cloud technologies in pedagogical management: harmonious, functional and unproductive. It has been found that in the conditions of quarantine restrictions, educational managers accumulated their capabilities to the maximum, mastering the necessary cloud services in a short period of time, which led to a sharp increase in their level of information and digital competence.","Shvardak, M.

Even with the application of statistical inference by Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of a diagnosis, with and without testing capabilities, some cases may still carry a degree of uncertainty. This has important implications for limiting the spread of disease. The basis for isolation and quarantine is a known diagnosis. This case is an example of a diagnostic conundrum that required more thorough use of testing methods, particularly serological testing, to guide the isolation recommendations for a patient with COVID-19. This will be helpful to other diagnosticians by providing an example of how serological findings may be effectively applied in the course of individual COVID-19 management.","Knight, Dacre; Irizarry-Alvarado, Joan",BMJ case reports,,247

458931,The effect of tocilizumab on severe COVID-19 infection: Review of current evidence,2021,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a fatal epizootic swine coronavirus that presents a financial threat to the global swine industry. Since the discovery of the low-pathogenic genotype 1b (G1b) in 2014, it has been responsible for sporadic outbreaks in South Korea. In this study, we identified novel G1b variants arising from the natural recombination of a major pandemic-like G2b virus and a minor G1b virus currently circulating in the domestic field. The whole-genome sequences of two 2018-19 G1b recombinants, KNU-1808 and KNU-1909, were determined. A genomic comparison showed that these two viruses share the highest nucleotide sequence similarity with the 2017 G1b strain but share less similarity with the 2014 G1b emergent strain KNU-1406. However, the putative recombination breakpoints spanning the first 1,170 nucleotides of the spike (S) gene were almost identical among the emergent and contemporary G1b strains. Recombination detection indicated that the inter-subgroup G1b recombinant first emerged in 2017 by introducing the N-terminal domain of S from KNU-1406 into the backbone of KNU-1703, possibly leading to antigenic shift. It then evolved into KNU-1808 and KNU-1909 through genetic drift, moving toward a more G2b-like genotype. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 2018-2019 G1b recombinants belong to a cluster containing other G1b strains but form a new branch. This study provides an important advance warning in regard to the emergence and prevalence of new genotypes or variants that can result from genetic recombination between two different PEDV genotypes circulating in endemic areas and continuous non-lethal mutations essential for viral fitness in the host environment.","Park, Jonghyun; Lee, Changhee",Arch. virol,,247

459713,Asymptomatic COVID-19 Infection in a Patient Evaluated for Ureteric Colic: Radiological Findings and Impact on Management,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hematological patients, receiving intensive chemotherapy (predominantly acute leukemia patients), have repeated postchemotherapy periods with severe bone marrow suppression. As a result, these patients require regular monitoring of the complete blood counts (CBC) for optimal patient care. To reduce the strain on the patient, there is a need for a point-of-care (POC) hematology device that provides rapid and reliable results both in general and in cytopenic samples and is suitable for outpatient clinics. We evaluated the HemoScreen device for the most used CBC parameter both overall and at the lower range. METHODS: The HemoScreen was compared with the Sysmex XN-9000 in 206 routine venous samples and 79 capillary bedside samples focusing on white blood cells (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), red blood cells (RBC), PLT and HGB. RESULTS: The HemoScreen was less precise compared to the acceptance criteria set for larger and more advanced hematology instrument with a CV% 3.0-3.7 for WBCs, 3.6-8.4 for ANCs, 1.1-1.5 for RBCs, 2.5-4.4 for PLTs, and 1.7-2.3 for HGB. Correlation coefficient for all five parameters for the entire range was r >.95 and r >.90 at lower range for venous and capillary samples. Bias limits were within the CTCAE acceptance limits. CONCLUSIONS: The HemoScreen provides rapid and accurate test results, for evaluation of WBC, PLT, and HGB, as well as at low concentrations for guiding transfusions and postchemotherapy treatment. The device is easy to operate and can measure both venous and capillary samples. Therefore, the HemoScreen is well suited for smaller outpatient clinics and potentially home use.","Kristian Kur, Dår; Thøgersen, Danny; Kjeldsen, Lars; Friis-Hansen, Lennart",Int. j. lab. hematol,,247

The immunologic determinants of this risk, the duration of infectiousness, and optimal treatment and prevention strategies in immunocompromised hosts are ill-defined. Of additional concern is the widespread use of immunosuppressive medications (corticosteroids, IL-6 antagonists) to treat COVID-19, which may enhance and prolong viral replication in the context of immunodeficiency. We outline the rationale for four inter-related approaches to usher in an era of evidence-based medicine for optimal management of immunocompromised patients with COVID-19: 1) multicenter pathogenesis and outcomes studies to relate the risk of severe disease to the type and degree of immunodeficiency; 2) studies evaluating immunologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines; 3) studies evaluating the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies for primary prophylaxis; and 4) clinical trials of novel antiviral agents for the treatment of COVID-19.","Haidar, Ghady; Mellors, John W",Clin. infect. dis,,247

461627,"Vascular Events, Vascular Disease and Vascular Risk Factors-Strongly Intertwined with COVID-19",2020,"BACKGROUND: Reverse transcription of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (+)RNA genome and subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) and subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the reliable diagnostic gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis and the identification of potential spreaders. Apart from clinical relevance and containment, for specific questions, it might be of interest to (re)investigate cases with low SARS-CoV-2 load, where RT-qPCR alone can deliver conflicting results, even though these cases might neither be clinically relevant nor significant for containment measures, because they might probably not be infectious. In order to expand the diagnostic bandwidth for non-routine questions, particularly for the reliable discrimination between negative and false-negative specimens associated with high CT values, we combined the RT-qPCR workflow with subsequent pyrosequencing of a S-gene amplicon. This expansion can help to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infections without the demand of confirmative antibody testing, which requires to summon patients again for blood sampling few to several weeks after symptom onset. RESULTS: We successfully established a combined RT-qPCR and S-gene pyrosequencing method which can be optionally exploited after routine diagnostics. This allows a reliable interpretation of RT-qPCR results in specimens with relatively low viral loads and close to the detection limits of qPCR. After laboratory implementation, we tested the combined method in a large pediatric cohort from two German medical centers (n=769). Pyrosequencing after RT-qPCR enabled us to uncover 5 previously unrecognized cases of pediatric SARS-CoV-2-associated diseases, mainly exhibiting mild and heterogeneous presentation-apart from a single case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2, who was hospitalized in the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed protocol allows a specific and sensitive confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infections close to the detection limits of RT-qPCR. The tested biotinylated primers do not negatively affect the RT-qPCR pipeline and thus can be optionally applied to enable deeper inspection of RT-qPCR results by subsequent pyrosequencing. Moreover, due to the incremental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, we note that the used strategy can uncover (Spike) P681H allowing the pre-selection of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 candidate specimens for deep sequencing.","Weil, Patrick Philipp; Hentschel, Jacqueline; Schult, Frank; Pembaur, Anton; Ghebremedhin, Beniam; Mboma, Olivier; Heusch, Andreas; Reuter, Anna-Christin; Müller, Daniel; Wirth, Stefan; Aydin, Malik; Jenke, Andreas C W; Postberg, Jan",Mol Cell Pediatr,,247
461919,Thrombotic Microangiopathy Variants Are Independently Associated with Critical Disease in COVID-19 Patients,2020,"On university campuses and in similar congregate environments, surveillance testing of asymptomatic persons is a critical strategy (1,2) for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All students at Duke University, a private research university in Durham, North Carolina, signed the Duke Compact (3), agreeing to observe mandatory masking, social distancing, and participation in entry and surveillance testing. The university implemented a five-to-one pooled testing program for SARS-CoV-2 using a quantitative, in-house, laboratory-developed, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test (4,5). Pooling of specimens to enable large-scale testing while minimizing use of reagents was pioneered during the human immunodeficiency virus pandemic (6). A similar methodology was adapted for Duke University's asymptomatic testing program. The baseline SARS-CoV-2 testing plan was to distribute tests geospatially and temporally across on- and off-campus student populations. By September 20, 2020, asymptomatic testing was scaled up to testing targets, which include testing for residential undergraduates twice weekly, off-campus undergraduates one to two times per week, and graduate students approximately once weekly. In addition, in response to newly identified positive test results, testing was focused in locations or within cohorts where data suggested an increased risk for transmission. Scale-up over 4 weeks entailed redeploying staff members to prepare 15 campus testing sites for specimen collection, developing information management tools, and repurposing laboratory automation to establish an asymptomatic surveillance system. During August 2-October 11, 68,913 specimens from 10,265 graduate and undergraduate students were tested. Eighty-four specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 51% were among persons with no symptoms. Testing as a result of contact tracing identified 27.4% of infections. A combination of risk-reduction strategies and frequent surveillance testing likely contributed to a prolonged period of low transmission on campus. These findings highlight the importance of combined testing and contact tracing strategies beyond symptomatic testing, in association with other preventive measures. Pooled testing balances resource availability with supply-chain disruptions, high throughput with high sensitivity, and rapid turnaround with an acceptable workload.","Denny, Thomas N; Andrews, Laura; Bonsignori, Mattia; Cavanaugh, Kyle; Datto, Michael B; Deckard, Anastasia; DeMarco, C Todd; DeNaeyer, Nicole; Epling, Carol A; Gurley, Thaddeus; Haase, Steven B; Hallberg, Chloe; Harer, John; Kneifel, Charles L; Lee, Mark J; Louzao, Raul; Moody, M Anthony; Moore, Zack; Polage, Christopher R; Puglin, Jamie; Spotts, P Hunter; Vaughn, John A; Wolfe, Cameron R",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,247

462357,Digital triage for people with multiple sclerosis in the age of COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Rapid worldwide spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This review article provides emergency physicians with an overview of the most current understanding of COVID-19 and recommendations on the evaluation and management of patients with suspected COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for causing COVID-19, is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through close contact (approximately 6 ft) by respiratory droplets. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses. Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities. Patients with suspected COVID-19 should be asked to wear a facemask. Respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and personal protective equipment are recommended for all healthcare personnel caring for suspected cases. Disposition depends on patient symptoms, hemodynamic status, and patient ability to self-quarantine. CONCLUSION: This narrative review provides clinicians with an updated approach to the evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.","Chavez, Summer; Long, Brit; Koyfman, Alex; Liang, Stephen Y",Am. j. emerg. med,,247
462937,Commercial Air Travel for Passengers With Cardiovascular Disease: Stressors of Flight and Aeromedical Impact,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-pandemic has facilitated the implementation of telemedicine in both clinical practice and research. We highlight recent developments in three promising areas of telemedicine: teleconsultation, telemonitoring, and teletreatment. We illustrate this using Parkinson's disease as a model for other chronic neurological disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Teleconsultations can reliably administer parts of the neurological examination remotely, but are typically not useful for establishing a reliable diagnosis. For follow-ups, teleconsultations can provide enhanced comfort and convenience to patients, and provide opportunities for blended and proactive care models. Barriers include technological challenges, limited clinician confidence, and a suboptimal clinician-patient relationship. Telemonitoring using wearable sensors and smartphone-based apps can support clinical decision-making, but we lack large-scale randomized controlled trials to prove effectiveness on clinical outcomes. Increasingly many trials are now incorporating telemonitoring as an exploratory outcome, but more work remains needed to demonstrate its clinical meaningfulness. Finding a balance between benefits and burdens for individual patients remains vital. Recent work emphasised the promise of various teletreatment solutions, such as remotely adjustable deep brain stimulation parameters, virtual reality enhanced exercise programs, and telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy.

465866,Re: Controversy in coronaViral Imaging and Diagnostics (COVID). A reply,2020,"The NHS 111 telephone advice and triage service is a vital part of the management of urgent and emergency care (UEC) services in England. Demand for NHS 111 advice has increased since its introduction in 2013, and the service is of particular importance in light of the current pandemic and resulting increased demand for emergency care. Currently, little is known about the effectiveness of NHS 111 in terms of the appropriateness of the advice given, or about the compliance of patients with that advice. We aimed to address this issue by analysing a large linked routine dataset of all NHS 111 calls (n = 3,631,069) and subsequent emergency department (ED) attendances made in the Yorkshire & Humber region from March 2013-March 2017. We found that many patients do not comply with advice, with 11% (n = 289,748) of patients attending ED when they are advised to self-care or seek primary care. We also found that a considerable number of these patients are further classed as urgent (88%, n = 255,931) and a substantial minority (37%, 106,207) are subsequently admitted to hospital. Further, many patients who are sent an ambulance or told to attend ED are classed as non-urgent upon attending ED (9%, n = 42,372). This research suggests that the level at which NHS 111 is currently triaging results in many hundreds of thousands of mis-triaged cases annually. Additionally, patients frequently do not comply with the advice they receive. This has implications for understanding the accuracy and efficiency of triaging systems.","Lewis, Jen; Stone, Tony; Simpson, Rebecca; Jacques, Richard; O039,; Keeffe, Colin; Croft, Susan; Mason, Suzanne",PLoS One,,247

466604,Corrigendum: Antifibrotics in COVID-19 Lung Disease: Let Us Stay Focused,2020,"Introduction: Variable rate intravenous insulin infusion(VRIII) is a cornerstone treatment for controlling elevatedblood glucose (BG) in inpatients who are missing meals,and/or have a critical illness. VRIII can cause serious harmto patients if used incorrectly. Traditional approaches toimproving safety have focused on identifying errors, thenfinding solutions to prevent future recurrence. Such approaches fail to fully take into account the complex adaptive nature of healthcare systems, which cannot be controlledsolely by standards or procedures. The Resilient Health Care(RHC) approach proposes that understanding the variabilityin healthcare practitioners' everyday work e.g. a physical andcognitive activity directed toward achieving a specific goal, iskey to enhancing patient safety (1). There are a considerablenumber of studies on using RHC to enhance safety, however,no studies to date have researched resilience in the use ofVRIII.Aim: This study sought to comprehensively understand,within a RHC framework, how VRIIIs are used in the clinicalenvironment.Methods: A qualitative observational study was conducted in a Vascular Surgery Unit. A purposive sample of twoinpatients and all healthcare practitioners caring for VRIIIaspects for these patients were recruited. The researcher video-recorded healthcare practitioners while prescribing,administering and monitoring VRIII. The video data werethen transcribed and inductively coded to construct a deepunderstanding of the use of VRIII. A hierarchical task analysis (HTA) which is a core human factors approach (2) wasused to represent the actual task for the use of VRIII.Results: Twenty-two hours of video recordings of 10healthcare practitioners were used to develop the final HTAwith a top-level goal of controlling elevated BG using VRIII.The HTA clearly illustrated the complexity of using VRIIIsby highlighting more than 100 practical activities to achievethe goal. The observed challenges were mainly related tolack of knowledge e.g. the co-prescription of appropriateconcurrent IV fluids, and system and technology problemse.g. the need for frequent BG monitoring. The analysis ofthe video data identified various strategies that healthcarepractitioners used to respond to variability in work includingknowledge, standardising practice e.g. the using of ready-toadminister insulin infusions, and context-dependent adaptations including asking available colleagues to countersign administration and assigning the monitoring task to other staffwhen the nurses were busy. Most of the observed adaptationshad positive outcomes in terms of patient care delivery.Conclusion: This study was the first to have exploredhow 'work is done' in reference to the use of VRIII usingHTA. The study was limited by time, the Covid-19 pandemicand number of participants. However, the developed HTAprovided detailed tasks and, by highlighting when and howadaptations were used, systematically presented the processas it was actually done. Future work will focus on using thedata from this study to model RHC in the use of VRIII in away that allows the study site to better enhance patient safety.","Iflaifel, M.; Lim, R. H.

466682,Parsonage Turner syndrome after COVID-19 vaccination,2021,"Heparanase (HPSE) is a multifunctional protein endowed with many non-enzymatic functions and a unique enzymatic activity as an endo-ß-D-glucuronidase. The latter allows it to serve as a key modulator of extracellular matrix (ECM) via a well-regulated cleavage of heparan sulfate side chains of proteoglycans at cell surfaces. The cleavage and associated changes at the ECM cause release of multiple signaling molecules with important cellular and pathological functions. New and emerging data suggest that both enzymatic as well as non-enzymatic functions of HPSE are important for health and illnesses including viral infections and virally induced cancers. This review summarizes recent findings on the roles of HPSE in activation, inhibition, or bioavailability of key signaling molecules such as AKT, VEGF, MAPK-ERK, and EGFR, which are known regulators of common viral infections in immune and non-immune cell types. Altogether, our review provides a unique overview of HPSE in cell-survival signaling pathways and how they relate to viral infections.","Koganti, Raghuram; Suryawanshi, Rahul; Shukla, Deepak",Cell Mol Life Sci,,247

Follow-up usually includes measurement of both whole blood cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) concentrations. Our experience is that Cr is seldom independently elevated. We wanted to ascertain whether blood Cr measurements could be omitted from follow-up protocols without lowering the quality of follow-up. We identified 8438 whole blood Co and Cr measurements performed without or prior to revision surgery. When the cut-off levels 5 µg/L and 7 µg/L were used, Cr was independently elevated in only 0.5% (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.3 to 0.6) and 0.2% (CI 0.1 to 0.3) of the measurements. The models with continuous variables showed that the higher the blood metal concentrations are the lower the percentage of measurements with Cr higher than Co. Our results suggest that whole blood Cr is very rarely independently elevated and therefore the authorities should consider omitting Cr measurements from their screening guidelines of MoM hip replacements. We believe this change in practice would simplify follow-up and lead to cost savings without decreasing the quality of follow-up.","Lainiala, Olli; Karsikas, Mari; Reito, Aleksi; Eskelinen, Antti",Sci Rep,,247

Meanwhile, cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has attracted increasing attention for its positive effects on the cardiovascular system. There is overwhelming evidence that CR for patients with CVD is effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To learn more about the development of CR, 5,567 papers about CR and related research were retrieved in the Web of Science Core Collection from 2001 to 2020. Then, these publications were scientometrically analyzed based on CiteSpace in terms of spatiotemporal distribution, author distribution, subject categories, topic distribution, and references. The results can be elaborated from three aspects. Firstly, the number of annual publications related to CR has increased year by year in general over the past two decades. Secondly, a co-occurrence analysis of the output countries and authors shows that a few developed countries such as the United States, Canada, and the UK are the most active in carrying out CR and where regional academic communities represented by Sherry Grace and Ross Arena were formed. Thirdly, an analysis of the subject categories and topic distribution of the papers reveals that CR is a typical interdiscipline with a wide range of disciplines involved, including clinical medicine, basic medicine, public health management, and sports science. The research topics cover the participants and implementers, components, and the objectives and requirements of CR. The current research hotspots are the three core modalities of CR, namely patient education, exercise training and mental support, as well as mobile health (mHealth) dependent on computer science. In conclusion, this work has provided some useful information for acquiring knowledge about CR, including identifying potential collaborators for researchers interested in CR, and discovering research trends and hot topics in CR, which can offer some guidance for more extensive and in-depth CR-related studies in the future.","Yuan, G.

467958,COVID-19 and nicotine as a mediator of ACE-2,2020,"PURPOSE: The vascular enlargement (VE) pattern differs from previously described imaging patterns for pneumonia. This study aimed to investigate the incidence, computed tomography (CT) characteristics, and diagnostic value of the VE pattern in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHOD: The CT data of 106 patients with COVID-19 from January 19 to February 29, 2020, and 52 patients with influenza virus pneumonia (IVP) from January 2018 to February 2020 were retrospectively collected. The incidences of the VE pattern between the two groups were compared. The CT manifestations of COVID-19 were analyzed with a particular focus on the VE pattern's specific CT signs, dynamic changes, and relationships with lesion size and disease severity. RESULTS: Peripheral and multilobar ground-glass opacities (GGOs) or mixed GGOs with various sizes and morphologies were typical features of COVID-19 on initial CT. The VE pattern was more common in COVID-19 (88/106, 83.02 %) than in IVP (10/52, 19.23 %) on initial CT (P < 0.001). Three special VE-pattern-specific CT signs, including central vascular sign, ginkgo leaf sign, and comb sign, were identified. Four types of dynamic changes in the VE pattern were observed on initial and follow-up CT, which were closely associated with the evolution of lesions and the time interval from the onset of symptoms to initial CT scan. The VE pattern in COVID-19 was more commonly seen in larger lesions and patients with severe-critical type (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The VE pattern is a valuable CT sign for differentiating COVID-19 from IVP, which correlates with more extensive or serious disease. A good understanding of the CT characteristics of the VE pattern may contribute to the early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 and prediction of the evolution of lesions.","Li, Qi; Huang, Xing-Tao; Li, Chun-Hua; Liu, Dan; Lv, Fa-Jin",Eur J Radiol,,247

Furthermore, we analyze the stability of the model in the context of Ulam-Hyers and generalized Ulam-Hyers stability criteria. The concept of next-generation matrix was used to compute the basic reproduction number R0, a number that determines the spread or otherwise of the disease into the general population. We also investigated the local asymptotic stability for the derived disease-free equilibrium point.

470253,High expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in colorectal cancer patients,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to severely undermine the prosperity of the global health system. To combat this pandemic, effective screening techniques for infected patients are indispensable. There is no doubt that the use of chest X-ray images for radiological assessment is one of the essential screening techniques. Some of the early studies revealed that the patient's chest X-ray images showed abnormalities, which is natural for patients infected with COVID-19. In this paper, we proposed a parallel-dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) based COVID-19 detection system from chest x-ray images, named as Parallel-Dilated COVIDNet (PDCOVIDNet). First, the publicly available chest X-ray collection fully preloaded and enhanced, and then classified by the proposed method. Differing convolution dilation rate in a parallel form demonstrates the proof-of-principle for using PDCOVIDNet to extract radiological features for COVID-19 detection. Accordingly, we have assisted our method with two visualization methods, which are specifically designed to increase understanding of the key components associated with COVID-19 infection. Both visualization methods compute gradients for a given image category related to feature maps of the last convolutional layer to create a class-discriminative region. In our experiment, we used a total of 2,905 chest X-ray images, comprising three cases (such as COVID-19, normal, and viral pneumonia), and empirical evaluations revealed that the proposed method extracted more significant features expeditiously related to the suspected disease. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores reach 96.58%, 96.58%, 96.59%, and 96.58%, respectively, which is comparable or enhanced compared with the state-of-the-art methods.","Chowdhury, Nihad Karim; Rahman, Md.

Here, we report the ability of 20 human sera, drawn 2 or 4 weeks after two doses of BNT162b2, to neutralize USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 bearing variant spikes from Delta plus (Delta-AY.1, Delta-AY.2), Delta-{Delta}144 (Delta with the Y144 deletion of the Alpha variant), Lambda, and B. 1.1.519 lineage viruses. Geometric mean plaque reduction neutralization titers against Delta-AY.1, Delta-AY.2, and Delta-{Delta}144 viruses are slightly lower than against USA-WA1/2020, but all sera neutralize the variant viruses to titers of [≥]80. Neutralization titers against Lambda and B. 1.1.519 variants and against USA-WA1/2020 are equivalent. The susceptibility of Delta plus, Lambda, and other variants to neutralization by the sera indicates that antigenic change has not led to virus escape from vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies and supports ongoing mass immunization with BNT162b2 to control the variants and to minimize the emergence of new variants.","Liu, Jianying; Liu, Yang; Xia, Hongjie; Zou, Jing; Weaver, Scott; Swanson, Kena A.; Cai, Hui; Cutler, Mark; Cooper, David; Muik, Alexander; Jansen, Kathrin U.; Sahin, Ugur; Xie, Xuping; Dormitzer, Philip R.; Shi, Pei-Yong",,,247
471868,"Severe, Symptomatic Reinfection in a Patient with COVID-19",2020,"Health officials and scientists have warned that we face the threat of a potentially devastating influenza pandemic. Instead, we are now in the midst of a global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. National and international pandemic preparedness plans have focused on developing vaccines and antiviral treatments. Another way to confront the COVID-19 pandemic (and future pandemics) might be to treat patients with inexpensive and widely available generic drugs that target the host response to infection, not the virus itself. The feasibility of this idea was tested during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014. This experience should inform our approach to treating COVID-19 patients. It could also save lives during outbreaks of other emerging infectious diseases and episodes of everyday acute critical illness. If this ""bottom up"" syndromic approach to treating acute critical illness were shown to be effective, it could have a dramatic impact on health, equity and security throughout the world. HIGHLIGHTS: Uncertainty about the outcome of COVID-19 is driving the social, economic and political distress associated with the pandemic. Treating the host response to COVID-19 with inexpensive and widely available generic drugs might save lives and mitigate this distress. Undertaking research on this idea will require political leadership.","Fedson, David S",J. public health policy,,247

Florida is presented as a micro context of the impacts the pandemic has had on the local economy of a cruise-dependent region. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in many infected ships in the first quarter of 2020, the entire cruise industry was stopped and a prohibition on resuming this industry was implanted worldwide. This paper presents some of the consequences of stopping the cruise industry and the recommended protocols to respond to this pandemic situation. Due to the dramatic impacts for this entire industry, some cruise lines are trying to resume despite the fact that the COVID-19 is not yet under control. The first aim of this paper is to present the cruise industry and its importance for society; the main facts of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the correlation between cruise ships and the spread of this disease.

Methods: Retrospective study of patients operated on in the previous month and during the peak of the pandemic. We analysed the COVID-19 infection rate, the severity of respiratory infection according to the Brescia respiratory COVID-19 severity scale, the adopted therapeutic measures and the overall postoperative complications. Results: From 17th February to 31st March 2020, there was a progressive decrease in surgical activity, with only 213 patients operated on. This comprised 59 (27.8%) elective operations for oncological diseases, 97 (45.5%) elective operations for benign diseases and 57 (26.7%) as urgent procedures.There was a progressive increase in the rate of infection by COVID-19, with a total of 15 cases (7%). This included 10 patients (16.9%) in the elective group for oncological disease, 1 (1%) in the elective surgery group for benign disease and 4 (7%) in the urgent surgery group (p < 0.001). Five patients presented with a severe respiratory infection, of which 4 were affected by oncological disease. There were 3 deaths (1.4%), which were all due to the worsening of a respiratory infection. Conclusions: The patients undergoing the surgical procedures showed high rates of COVID-19 infection and postoperative complications, especially the patients with oncological diseases. Local resumption of surgical activity must be based on the prioritisation of the cases to be operated on, respecting certain premises of security and optimisation of the available resources.","Di Martino, Marcello; García Septiem, Javier; Maqueda González, Rocío; Muñoz de Nova, Jose Luis; de la Hoz Rodríguez, Ángela; Correa Bonito, Alba; Martín-Pérez, Elena",Cir Esp,,247

The research here focuses on a case study of Italy, one of the first countries to experience a rapid increase in numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals and deaths. Statistical analyses, based on daily data from February 2020 to February 2021, suggest that the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy had a high negative impact on health of people over February-May 2020 period; after that, negative effects declined from June 2020 onwards. Second wave of COVID-19 pandemic from August 2020 to February 2021 had a growing incidence of confirmed cases also associated with variants of coronavirus, whereas admissions to Intensive Care Units and total deaths had lower levels compared to first wave of COVID-19. Lessons learned of this comparative analysis between first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy can be generalized in similar geo-economic areas to support effective policy responses of crisis management to constrain the negative impact on health of people of recurring waves of COVID-19 pandemic and similar infectious diseases in future.","Coccia, Mario",Environ Res,,247

This upstream biochemical circuit is further wired with a downstream electrochemical interface, delivering an integrated bioanalytical platform.

474515,Do checkpoint inhibitors compromise the cancer patients' immunity and increase the vulnerability to COVID-19 infection?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Involvement with Child Protective Services (CPS) provides an opportunity to recognize those children at risk for ongoing adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). The relationship between ACEs and child health among CPS-involved children and the role of primary care providers (PCPs) in moderating this relationship is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a convergent mixed-methods study of caregivers of children age 2 to 12 years with a CPS finding of physical abuse, modeling the association between cumulative ACEs and child health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the PedsQL4.0, a validated 23-item survey of multidimensional health, with and without the moderator of a patient-centered medical home. Interviews elicited descriptions of a child's experience with ACEs, the impact of ACEs on child health, and the role of a PCP in this context. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-eight surveyed caregivers reported a mean of 5.5 (±3.3) ACE exposures per child. In a fully adjusted model, each ACE resulted in a 1.3-point (95% confidence interval: 0.7-2.0) reduction in HRQoL, a clinically important difference in HRQoL associated with ACE exposures. This association was explained by reduced psychosocial HRQoL and was not moderated by a patient-centered medical home. Twenty-seven interviewed caregivers described the influence of ACEs on a child's health. Many felt that a trusted PCP could support a child's well-being after such experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Children with CPS involvement have ACE exposures that are associated with reduced HRQoL. Although PCPs are often unaware of CPS involvement or other ACEs, many caregivers welcome the support of a child's PCP in improving child well-being after adversity.","Campbell, Kristine A; Gamarra, Elizabeth; Frost, Caren J; Choi, Bom; Keenan, Heather T",Pediatrics,,247

Evidence from previous pandemics suggest that bariatric patients may experience increased emotional distress and difficulty adhering to healthy lifestyle changes post-surgery. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the impact of the novel COVID-19 public health crisis on bariatric patients' self-management post-surgery. METHOD: In a nested-qualitative study, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 23 post-operative bariatric patients who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) at a Canadian Bariatric Surgery Program between 2014 and 2020. A constant comparative approach was used to systematically analyze the data and identify the overarching themes. RESULTS: Participants (n = 23) had a mean age of (48.82 ± 10.03) years and most were female (n = 19). The median time post-surgery was 2 years (range: 6 months-7 years). Themes describing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients' post-bariatric surgery self-management included: coping with COVID-19; vulnerability factors and physical isolation; resiliency factors during pandemic; and valuing access to support by virtual care. The need for patients to access post-operative bariatric care during COVID-19 differed based on gender and socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted patients' ability to self-manage obesity and their mental health in a variety of ways. These findings suggest that patients may experience unique psychological distress and challenges requiring personalized care strategies to improve obesity self-care and overall well-being.","Youssef, Alaa; Cassin, Stephanie E; Wnuk, Susan; Leung, Samantha; Jackson, Timothy; Sockalingam, Sanjeev",Appetite,,247

In particular, it has been difficult to arrange ship surveys due to a restriction on surveyors’ travel to reach ports for the surveys. However, to keep ships to continue operating, all ships must be surveyed and have relevant certificates renewed in a timely manner. In response, Classification Societies and flag Administrations have come up with temporary measure by granting 3-month extension of ship surveys. The rationale for granting extension up to 3 months can be found in Class rules and IMO instruments in force majeure clauses and extension clauses respectively. However, the real test is just beginning for further extension beyond 3 months as the COVID-19 pandemic seems to prolong globally, and there is no legal ground for this further extension in both Class rules and IMO instruments. Thus, granting such extension beyond 3 months of statutory maximum would leave uncertainty about the legal exposure of all parties involved in case a ship were victimized during the extension period. To ease the legal uncertainty, this paper suggests that the force majeure clause in Class rules should be amended to cover the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also suggested that IMO should embark the discussion to amend the extension clause, to cover the possibility of not being able to find a port in which a ship can be surveyed within 3 months in the wake of world-wide pandemic like the COVID-19 outbreak.","Nam, Dong Kim Mingyu",Marine Policy,,247

478975,Abstract #1017450: COVID-19 Associated Grave’s Disease Identified in a 45-year-old Male,2021,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is currently leading to increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients all over the world. Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic, mild respiratory tract infection, to severe cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and death. Reports on a dysregulated immune system in the severe cases call for a better characterization and understanding of the changes in the immune system. METHODS: In order to dissect COVID-19-driven immune host responses, we performed RNA-seq of whole blood cell transcriptomes and granulocyte preparations from mild and severe COVID-19 patients and analyzed the data using a combination of conventional and data-driven co-expression analysis. Additionally, publicly available data was used to show the distinction from COVID-19 to other diseases. Reverse drug target prediction was used to identify known or novel drug candidates based on finding from data-driven findings. RESULTS: Here, we profiled whole blood transcriptomes of 39 COVID-19 patients and 10 control donors enabling a data-driven stratification based on molecular phenotype. Neutrophil activation-associated signatures were prominently enriched in severe patient groups, which was corroborated in whole blood transcriptomes from an independent second cohort of 30 as well as in granulocyte samples from a third cohort of 16 COVID-19 patients (44 samples). Comparison of COVID-19 blood transcriptomes with those of a collection of over 3100 samples derived from 12 different viral infections, inflammatory diseases, and independent control samples revealed highly specific transcriptome signatures for COVID-19. Further, stratified transcriptomes predicted patient subgroup-specific drug candidates targeting the dysregulated systemic immune response of the host. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides novel insights in the distinct molecular subgroups or phenotypes that are not simply explained by clinical parameters. We show that whole blood transcriptomes are extremely informative for COVID-19 since they capture granulocytes which are major drivers of disease severity.","Aschenbrenner, Anna C; Mouktaroudi, Maria; Krämer, Benjamin; Oestreich, Marie; Antonakos, Nikolaos; Nuesch-Germano, Melanie; Gkizeli, Konstantina; Bonaguro, Lorenzo; Reusch, Nico; Baßler, Kevin; Saridaki, Maria; Knoll, Rainer; Pecht, Tal; Kapellos, Theodore S; Doulou, Sarandia; Kröger, Charlotte; Herbert, Miriam; Holsten, Lisa; Horne, Arik; Gemünd, Ioanna D; Rovina, Nikoletta; Agrawal, Shobhit; Dahm, Kilian; van Uelft, Martina; Drews, Anna; Lenkeit, Lena; Bruse, Niklas; Gerretsen, Jelle; Gierlich, Jannik; Becker, Matthias; Händler, Kristian; Kraut, Michael; Theis, Heidi; Mengiste, Simachew; De Domenico, Elena; Schulte-Schrepping, Jonas; Seep, Lea; Raabe, Jan; Hoffmeister, Christoph; ToVinh, Michael; Keitel, Verena; Rieke, Gereon; Talevi, Valentina; Skowasch, Dirk; Aziz, N Ahmad; Pickkers, Peter; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Netea, Mihai G; Schultze, Joachim L; Kox, Matthijs",Genome Med,,247

481104,Pulmonary Vascular Pathology in Covid-19,2020,"AIM: Little is known about the clinical profile of COVID-19 infection in polyhandicapped persons. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of this infection among individuals with polyhandicap. METHOD: This was a retrospective observational study. Polyhandicap was defined by the combination of motor deficiency, profound mental retardation, and age at onset of cerebral lesion younger than 6 years. A positive COVID-19 status was considered for patients with a positive COVID-19 laboratory test result, or patients presenting with compatible symptoms and living in an institution or at home with other patients or relatives who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Data collection included sociodemographic data, clinical and paraclinical characteristics, as well as the management and treatment for COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We collected 98 cases, with a sex ratio of 0.98 and a mean age of 38.5 years (3 months to 73 years). COVID-19 infection was paucisymptomatic in 46% of patients, 20.6% of patients presented with dyspnea, while the most frequent extra-respiratory symptoms were digestive (26.5%) and neurological changes (24.5%); 18 patients required hospital admission, four adults died. The mean duration of infection was longer for adults than for children, and the proportion of taste and smell disorders was higher in older patients. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PLH persons often develop paucisymptomatic forms of COVID-19 infection, although they may also experience severe outcomes, including death. Clinicians should be aware that COVID-19 symptoms in PLH persons are often extra-respiratory signs, mostly digestive and neurologic, which may help in the earlier identification of COVID-19 infection in this particular population of patients.","Rousseau, M-C; Hully, M; Milh, M; Juzeau, D; Pollez, B; Peudenier, S; Bahi Buisson, N; Gautheron, V; Chabrol, B; Billette de Villemeur, T",Arch. pediatr,,247
481276,The paradoxical effect of IL-6 and implications for the use of Tocilizumab in Covid-19 patients,2020,"Purpose: SARS-CoV-2 engages human ACE2 through its spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to enter the host cell. Recent computational studies have reported that withanone and withaferin A, phytochemicals found in Withania somnifera, target viral main protease (MPro) and host transmembrane TMPRSS2, and glucose related protein 78 (GRP78), respectively, implicating their potential as viral entry inhibitors. Absence of specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection has encouraged exploration of phytochemicals as potential antivirals. Aim: This study aimed at in silico exploration, along with in vitro and in vivo validation of antiviral efficacy of the phytochemical withanone. Methods: Through molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and electrostatic energy calculation the plausible biochemical interactions between withanone and the ACE2-RBD complex were investigated. These in silico observations were biochemically validated by ELISA-based assays. Withanone-enriched extract from W. somnifera was tested for its ability to ameliorate clinically relevant pathological features, modelled in humanized zebrafish through SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein induction. Results: Withanone bound efficiently at the interacting interface of the ACE2-RBD complex and destabilized it energetically. The electrostatic component of binding free energies of the complex was significantly decreased. The two intrachain salt bridge interactions (K31-E35) and the interchain long-range ion-pair (K31-E484), at the ACE2-RBD interface were completely abolished by withanone, in the 50 ns simulation. In vitro binding assay experimentally validated that withanone efficiently inhibited (IC50=0.33 ng/mL) the interaction between ACE2 and RBD, in a dose-dependent manner. A withanone-enriched extract, without any co-extracted withaferin A, was prepared from W. somnifera leaves. This enriched extract was found to be efficient in ameliorating human-like pathological responses induced in humanized zebrafish by SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study provided experimental validation for computational insight into the potential of withanone as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus entry into the host cells.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Pokhrel, Subarna; Singh, Hoshiyar; Joshi, Monali; Mulay, Vallabh Prakash; Haldar, Swati; Varshney, Anurag",Drug Des Devel Ther,,247

481780,Cardiovascular Complications of COVID-19: Pharmacotherapy Perspective,2020,"Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious disease of pigs, sheep, goats, bovine, and various wild cloven-hoofed animals caused by foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) that has given rise to significant economic loss to global livestock industry. FMDV 3B protein is an important determinant of virulence of the virus. Modifications in 3B protein of FMDV considerably decrease virus yield. In the current study, we demonstrated the significant role of 3B protein in suppression of type I IFN production and host antiviral response in both human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells and porcine kidney PK-15 cells. We found that 3B protein interacted with the viral RNA sensor RIG-I to block RIG-I-mediated immune signaling. 3B protein did not affect the expression of RIG-I but interacted with RIG-I to block the interaction between RIG-I and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, which prevented the TRIM25-mediated, Lys63-linked ubiquitination and activation of RIG-I. This inhibition of RIG-I-mediated immune signaling by 3B protein decreased IFN-ß, IFN-stimulated genes, and proinflammatory cytokines expression, which in turn promoted FMDV replication. All of the three nonidentical copies of 3B could inhibit type I IFN production, and the aa 17A in each copy of 3B was involved in suppression of IFN-related antiviral response during FMDV infection in porcine cells. Together, our results indicate the role of 3B in suppression of host innate immune response and reveal a novel antagonistic mechanism of FMDV that is mediated by 3B protein.","Zhang, Xiangle; Zhu, Zixiang; Wang, Congcong; Yang, Fan; Cao, Weijun; Li, Pengfei; Du, Xiaoli; Zhao, Furong; Liu, Xiangtao; Zheng, Haixue",J. immunol,,247

Since currently, there is no causative drug against this viral infection available, science is striving for new drugs and approaches to treat the new disease. Studies have shown that the cell entry of coronaviruses into host cells takes place through the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cell receptors. Priming of the S protein occurs via hydrolysis by different host proteases. The inhibition of these proteases could impair the processing of the S protein, thereby affecting the interaction with the host-cell receptors and preventing virus cell entry. Hence, inhibition of these proteases could be a promising strategy for treatment against SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the current state of the art of developing inhibitors against the entry proteases furin, the transmembrane serine protease type-II (TMPRSS2), trypsin, and cathepsin L.","Müller, Patrick; Maus, Hannah; Hammerschmidt, Stefan Josef; Knaff, Philip; Mailänder, Volker; Schirmeister, Tanja; Kersten, Christian",Curr. med. chem,,247

According to WHO data from May 15, 2020, out of 153,517 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 5,735 deaths were recorded, allowing to determine the mortality rate at about 3.7%, which decreased significantly in the following months. The presented analysis from USA indicated that the elderly and those burdened with comorbidities are the most at risk groups, among them mainly those with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Similar data were obtained in Sweden, a country where no strict sanitary regimen was introduced, adopting the principle of creating herd immunity. On the other hand, Polish information is not corroborated by reliable studies, both in terms of the number and quality of diagnostic tests performed and the treatment used in individual groups infected with SARS-CoV-2 and patients.

There are many different forms of abusive language such as hate speech, profanity, and cyber-bullying, and online platforms seek to moderate it in order to limit societal harm, to comply with legislation, and to create a more inclusive environment for their users. Within the field of Natural Language Processing, researchers have developed different methods for automatically detecting abusive language, often focusing on specific subproblems or on narrow communities, as what is considered abusive language very much differs by context. We argue that there is currently a dichotomy between what types of abusive language online platforms seek to curb, and what research efforts there are to automatically detect abusive language. We thus survey existing methods as well as content moderation policies by online platforms in this light, and we suggest directions for future work.","Nakov, Preslav; Nayak, Vibha; Dent, Kyle; Bhatawdekar, Ameya; Sarwar, Sheikh Muhammad; Hardalov, Momchil; Dinkov, Yoan; Zlatkova, Dimitrina; Bouchard, Guillaume; Augenstein, Isabelle",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00153v1.pdf,247

487653,The Impact of Old and Novel Cardiovascular Risk Factors,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than 96 million people worldwide, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic in March 2020. Although an optimal medical treatment of COVID-19 remains uncertain, an unprecedented global effort to develop an effective vaccine hopes to restore pre-pandemic conditions. Since cancer patients as a group have been shown to be at a higher risk of severe COVID-19, the development of safe and effective vaccines is crucial. However, cancer patients may be underrepresented in ongoing phase 3 randomised clinical trials investigating COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, we encourage stakeholders to provide real-time data about the characteristics of recruited participants, including clearly identifiable subgroups, like cancer patients, with sample sizes large enough to determine safety and efficacy. Moreover, we envisage a prompt implementation of suitable registries for pharmacovigilance reporting, in order to monitor the effects of COVID-19 vaccines and immunisation rates in patients with cancer. That said, data extrapolation from other vaccine trials (e.g. anti-influenza virus) showed a favourable safety and efficacy profile for cancer patients. On the basis of the evidence discussed, we believe that the benefits of the vaccination outweigh the risks. Consequently, healthcare authorities should prioritise vaccinations for cancer patients, with the time-point of administration agreed on a case-by-case basis. In this regard, the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society of Medical Oncology are advocating for cancer patients a high priority status, in the hope of attenuating the consequences of the pandemic in this particularly vulnerable population.","Corti, Chiara; Crimini, Edoardo; Tarantino, Paolo; Pravettoni, Gabriella; Eggermont, Alexander M M; Delaloge, Suzette; Curigliano, Giuseppe",Eur J Cancer,,247
487935,Are Children Less Susceptible To COVID-19? A Case Series,2020,"RNA-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are critical to limiting COVID-19 severity and spread. Cellular mechanisms driving antigen-specific responses to these vaccines, however, remain uncertain. We used single-cell technologies to identify and characterized antigen-specific cells and antibody responses to the RNA vaccine BNT162b2 in longitudinal samples from a cohort of healthy donors. Mass cytometry and machine learning pinpointed a novel expanding, population of antigen-specific non-canonical memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. B cell sequencing suggested progression from IgM, with apparent cross-reactivity to endemic coronaviruses, to SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG memory B cells and plasmablasts. Responding lymphocyte populations correlated with eventual SARS-CoV-2 IgG and a donor lacking these cell populations failed to sustain SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and experienced breakthrough infection. These integrated proteomic and genomic platforms reveal an antigen-specific cellular basis of RNA vaccine-based immunity.

488704,Mechanism of thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 patients,2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic has spread quickly across the globe in late 2019 and this has continued into 2020, causing a complete closure of daily routines, depleting global resources and, in extreme cases, causing loss of life. In Africa, with its hot climate, decision makers try to get people to their work as health care professionals or sometimes access health care facilities. For the peak four months; April, May, June, and July, the virus appeared, spread, and began to decrease. This study aims at analyzing the direct impact of Covid-19 in Africa according to the available data until July 2020. It provides statistics and policies prepared by African countries for this pandemic with the aid of other developed countries' experiences. From studying such applicable policies, it can be seen in a number of cases that lockdown restrictions, school and workplace closures, and limitations to the internal movement have the chief effect of reducing virus spread. Change in travel behavior and number of visitors appear in response to such a crisis. Regarding the potential economic repercussions in the studied period, GDP shows a sharp drop of 3.4%, appearing as a reduction of 6% on the price of oil, reducing the number of tourists by 46%, and causing fluctuations in currency. These suggest a mutual influence between the crisis and the transport sector.","Elbany, M; Elhenawy, Y",,,247

490005,E-cigarettes: informing the conversation with patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic has imposed extraordinary strains on healthcare workers. But, in contrast with acute settings, relatively little attention has been given to those who work in mental health settings. We aimed to characterise the experiences of those working in English NHS secondary mental health services during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: The design was a qualitative interview-based study. We conducted semi-structured, remote (telephone or online) interviews with 35 members of staff from NHS secondary (inpatient and community) mental health services in England. Analysis was based on the constant comparative method. RESULTS: Participants reported wide-ranging changes in the organisation of secondary mental health care and the nature of work in response to the pandemic, including pausing of all services deemed to be ""non-essential"", deployment of staff across services to new and unfamiliar roles, and moves to remote working. The quality of participants' working life was impaired by increasing levels of daily challenge associated with trying to provide care in trying and constrained circumstances, the problems of forging new ways of working remotely, and constraints on ability to access informal support. Participants were confronted with difficult dilemmas relating to clinical decision-making, prioritisation of care, and compromises in ability to perform the therapeutic function of their roles. Other dilemmas centred on trying to balance the risks of controlling infection with the need for human contact. Many reported features of moral injury linked to their perceived failures in providing the quality or level of care that they felt service users needed. They sometimes sought to compensate for deficits in care through increased advocacy, taking on additional tasks, or making exceptions, but this led to further personal strain. Many experienced feelings of grief, helplessness, isolation, distress, and burnout. These problems were compounded by sometimes poor communication about service changes and by staff feeling that they could not take time off because of the potential impact on others. Some reported feeling poorly supported by organisations. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health workers faced multiple adversities during the pandemic that were highly consequential for their wellbeing. These findings can help in identifying targets for support.","Liberati, Elisa; Richards, Natalie; Willars, Janet; Scott, David; Boydell, Nicola; Parker, Jennie; Pinfold, Vanessa; Martin, Graham; Dixon-Woods, Mary; Jones, Peter B",BMC Psychiatry,,247

In this consecutive study, we analysed RB and optic nerve biopsies (ONBs) in deceased patients with confirmed COVID-19 assessing viral RNA load, possible virus replication and infectivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case series, 14 eyes of 14 deceased patients with COVID-19 were enucleated during autopsy. RB and ONB were subjected to molecular detection of viral RNA, virus cultivation and immunohistochemistry. SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads were compared with RNA loads in the respective throat swabs, vitreous humour and blood samples. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 7/14 RBs and in 10/13 ONBs. While virus isolation failed and immunohistochemistry of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was negative, subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) was detectable (40% RB; 60% ONB). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detectable in RB and ONB of patients with COVID-19. Presence of sgRNA could point to a SARS-CoV-2 infection of neuronal tissue, but as virus isolation failed and immunohistochemistry of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was negative, an active infection seems unlikely.","Casagrande, Maria; Fitzek, Antonia; Spitzer, Martin; Püschel, Klaus; Glatzel, Markus; Krasemann, Susanne; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Nörz, Dominik; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Pfefferle, Susanne; Schultheiss, Maximilian",Br. j. ophthalmol,,247
491233,Implementing a Novel Remote Physician Treatment Coverage Practice for Adaptive Radiation Therapy During the Coronavirus Pandemic,2020,"Rationale: Prone positioning is a well-established recruitment maneuver to improve oxygenation and decrease mortality in intubated patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is evolving literature in utilizing proning among non-intubated and hypoxemic patients with novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). However, there is paucity of evidence proving a sustained improvement in patient-centered outcomes. We aimed to determine the association between prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 and incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or in-hospital mortality. Methods: We conducted a nested matched case-control analysis of adult COVID-19 patients admitted to three hospital sites in Bronx, NY between March 1, 2020 and April 1, 2020. Patients with do-not-intubate orders were excluded. Cases were defined by IMV or in-hospital mortality. Each case was matched with two controls based on age, gender, admission date within two weeks, and hospital length of stay greater than index time of matched case via risk-set sampling. Index time was defined as time after hospital admission when the case was intubated or died, whichever came first. The presence of non-intubated proning was identified from provider documentation. Results: We included 600 patients, 41 (6.8%) underwent non-intubated proning. Cases had lower SpO2/FiO2 (S/F) ratios prior to IMV or in-hospital mortality compared to controls (case median, 97 [interquartile range, 90-290] versus control median, 404 [interquartile range, 296-452]). While most providers (58.5%) documented immediate improvement in oxygenation status after initiating non-intubated proning, there was no difference in worst S/F ratios before and after non-intubated proning in both case and control (case median S/F ratio difference, 3 [interquartile range,-3-8] versus control median S/F ratio difference, 0 [interquartile range,-3-50]). In the univariate analysis, patients who underwent non-intubated proning were 2.57 times more likely to require IMV or experience in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio, 2.57;95% confidence interval, 1.17-5.64;P =.02). Following adjustment for patient level differences, we found no association between non-intubated proning and IMV or inhospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.92;95% confidence interval, 0.34-2.45;P =.86). Conclusions: Although many providers documented an immediate improvement in oxygenation after non-intubated proning, sustained improvement was not identified. Non-intubated proning did not reduce the need for IMV or in-hospital mortality after adjustment for severity of illness and oxygenation status. While non-intubated proning may temporarily improve hypoxemia, it may lead to harmful delays in intubation and respiratory complications. Physicians should rigorously monitor respiratory parameters when attempting non-intubated proning.","Nauka, P.; Chekuri, S.; Aboodi, M. S.; Hope, A. A.; Gong, M.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective cohort study. METHODS: Compound growth rates were calculated using cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 21, 2020, to March 31, 2020, in all 3139 US counties. Compound growth was chosen as it gives a single number that can be used in machine learning to represent the speed of virus spread during defined time intervals. Statistical analyses and a random forest machine learning model were used to analyze the data for differences in counties with and without SIP orders. RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed that the March 16 presidential recommendation (limiting gatherings to &#8804;10 people) lowered the compound growth rate of COVID-19 for all counties in the US by 6.6%, and the counties that implemented SIP after March 16 had a further reduction of 7.8% compared with the counties that did not implement SIP after March 16. A random forest machine learning model was built to predict compound growth rate after a SIP order and was found to have an accuracy of 92.3%. The random forest found that population, longitude, and population per square mile were the most important features when predicting the effect of SIP. CONCLUSIONS: SIP orders were found to be effective at reducing the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in the US. Counties with a large population or a high population density were found to benefit the most from a SIP order.","Cobb, J S; Seale, M A",Public Health,,247

492017,COVID-19 and liver injury: Where do we stand?,2020,"This study chronicles a research project on writing development that was affected by the current contexts of uncertainty. We were set to follow 24 students from diverse admissions channels for three years, during which we held meetings and collected writing materials. In October 2019, an unprecedented wave of civil unrest led to the closure of the campus and ended face-to-face meetings. In early 2020, just as the university was resuming contact with students, the COVID-19 pandemic again forced the suspension of in-person meetings. This article addresses methodological, ethical, and epistemological dilemmas involved in researching literacy in higher education under challenging circumstances. Moreover, understanding literacy as a social practice provided a theoretical framework useful to recognise emerging results as valuable information on literacy knowledge. The unexpected findings on student writing were shaped by the context of the crisis, in which agency, student engagement, and sponsorship became intrinsically linked to national events.

492389,Psychological stress of medical staffs during outbreak of COVID-19 and adjustment strategy,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Within this large-scale study, we compared clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, radiographic signs, and outcomes of COVID-19, SARS, and MERS to find unique features. METHOD: We searched all relevant literature published up to February 28, 2020. Depending on the heterogeneity test, we used either random or fixed-effect models to analyze the appropriateness of the pooled results. Study has been registered in the PROSPERO database (ID 176106). RESULT: Overall 114 articles included in this study; 52 251 COVID-19 confirmed patients (20 studies), 10 037 SARS (51 studies), and 8139 MERS patients (43 studies) were included. The most common symptom was fever; COVID-19 (85.6%, P < .001), SARS (96%, P < .001), and MERS (74%, P < .001), respectively. Analysis showed that 84% of Covid-19 patients, 86% of SARS patients, and 74.7% of MERS patients had an abnormal chest X-ray. The mortality rate in COVID-19 (5.6%, P < .001) was lower than SARS (13%, P < .001) and MERS (35%, P < .001) between all confirmed patients. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of submission, the mortality rate in COVID-19 confirmed cases is lower than in SARS- and MERS-infected patients. Clinical outcomes and findings would be biased by reporting only confirmed cases, and this should be considered when interpreting the data.","Pormohammad, Ali; Ghorbani, Saied; Khatami, Alireza; Farzi, Rana; Baradaran, Behzad; Turner, Diana L; Turner, Raymond J; Bahr, Nathan C; Idrovo, Juan-Pablo",Rev Med Virol,,247

This study aimed to describe the characteristics of children with COVID-19 with fatal outcomes in a tertiary referral hospital in Indonesia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data collected from the medical records of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia from March to October 2020. RESULTS: During the study period, 490 patients were admitted and diagnosed with suspected and probable COVID-19. Of these patients, 50 (10.2%) were confirmed to have COVID-19, and 20 (40%) had a fatal outcome. The fatality rate was higher in patients aged &#8805;10 years, categorized with severe disease upon admission, PaO2/FiO2 ratio &#8804;300 mmHg and chronic underlying diseases. The most common clinical manifestations were generalized symptoms, while acute respiratory distress syndrome (8/20) and septic shock (7/20) were the two most common causes of death. Increased procalcitonin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase and presepsin levels were found in all fatal cases. One patient met the criteria of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. CONCLUSION: Our work highlights the high mortality rate in paediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. These findings might be related to or co-incided with COVID-19 infection. Further studies are needed to improve understanding of the role of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in elaborating the mechanisms leading to death in children with comorbidities.","Dewi, Rismala; Kaswandani, Nastiti; Karyanti, Mulya Rahma; Setyanto, Darmawan Budi; Pudjiadi, Antonius Hocky; Hendarto, Aryono; Djer, Mulyadi M; Prayitno, Ari; Yuniar, Irene; Indawati, Wahyuni; Prawira, Yogi; Handryastuti, Setyo; Sjakti, Hikari Ambara; Hidayati, Eka Laksmi; Muktiarti, Dina; Soebadi, Amanda; Puspaningtyas, Niken Wahyu; Muhaimin, Riski; Rahmadhany, Anisa; Octavius, Gilbert Sterling; Puspitasari, Henny Adriani; Jasin, Madeleine Ramdhani; Tartila, Tartila; Putri, Nina Dwi",Int J Infect Dis,,247

A narrative review was conducted, overviewing items of the Infectious Disease Committee and the Tuberculosis Committee of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare between 2010 and 2019. The mean value of items discussed in each meeting were 9.7 items. Among these items, these committees have discussed about countermeasures in terms of reduced burden of indigenous infectious diseases such as measles, rubella and pertussis, and increased risk of imported infectious diseases such as Ebola virus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, plague, avian influenza, pandemic influenza and tuberculosis. These changes regarding infectious diseases lead to loss of target population, difficulty of early detection, and market failure in old and new antibiotics and others, which requires challenge to scattered at-risk targets, effort to training and awareness, and creation of novel public health policy for research and development as well as production and supply. Over the past decade, public health policy regarding global infectious diseases have been one of the key targets under the triangle of global infectious disease, and recent experience of Coronavirus disease 2019 will further prioritize it in Japan. However, the principles of public health policy are globally vulnerable in the Post-Corona era, which can lead to the collapse of democratic way.

493519,The rampant use of cow dung to treat COVID-19: Is India at the brink of a zoonotic disease outbreak?,2021,"PURPOSE: Practice-based guidelines recommend HIV testing during initial invasive cervical cancer (ICC) workup. Determinants of HIV testing during diagnosis of AIDS-defining cancers in vulnerable populations, where risk for HIV infection is higher, are under-explored. METHODS: We examine factors associated with patterns of HIV testing among Medicaid enrollees diagnosed with ICC. Using linked data from the New Jersey State Cancer Registry and New Jersey Medicaid claims and enrollment files, we evaluated HIV testing among 242 ICC cases diagnosed from 2012 to 2014 in ages 21-64 at (a) any point during Medicaid enrollment (2011-2014) and (b) during cancer workup 6 months pre ICC diagnosis to 6 months post ICC diagnosis. Logistic regression models identified factors associated with HIV testing. RESULTS: Overall, 13% of women had a claim for HIV testing during ICC workup. Two-thirds (68%) of women did not have a claim for HIV testing (non-receipt of HIV testing) while enrolled in Medicaid. Hispanic/NH-API/Other women had lower odds of non-receipt of HIV testing compared with NH-Whites (OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.17-0.94). Higher odds of non-receipt of HIV testing were observed among cases with no STI testing (OR: 4.92; 95% CI 2.27-10.67) and < 1 year of Medicaid enrollment (OR: 3.07; 95% CI 1.14- 8.26) after adjusting for other factors. CONCLUSIONS: Few women had HIV testing claims during ICC workup. Opportunities for optimal ICC care are informed by knowledge of HIV status. Further research should explore if lack of HIV testing claims during ICC workup is an accurate indicator of ICC care, and if so, to assess testing barriers during workup.","McGee-Avila, Jennifer K; Doose, Michelle; Nova, Jose; Kumar, Rizie; Stroup, Antoinette M; Tsui, Jennifer",Cancer causes control,,247

494216,Prophylaxis of COVID-19 with Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine,2021,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate optic nerve head parameters and inner retinal layer thicknesses in obese children and adolescents. METHODS: Forty-one eyes of 41 pediatric obese participants and 41 eyes of 41 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in this study. Body mass index was calculated, based on sex and age, using body weight and height measurements. Blood lipid values (i.e., cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride) were measured in obese participants. Optical coherence tomography was used to examine optic nerve head parameters, including rim area, disc area, cup-to-disc ratio, and cup volume, as well as the thicknesses of retinal nerve fiber layers and macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layers. RESULTS: Optic disc parameters were similar in obese and healthy children (p>0.05). The percentage of binocular retinal nerve fiber layer thickness symmetry was significantly different between obese and control groups (p=0.003). Compared to the control group, participants in the obese group exhibited thinner retinal nerve fiber layers in the superior quadrants (p=0.04) and thinner ganglion cell-inner plexiform layers in the superior-temporal sectors (p=0.04). There were no statistically significant correlations between the ocular parameters and lipid blood test values assessed in this study (p>0.05). Body mass index was significantly negatively correlated with the mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (r=-0.33, p=0.03) in the obese group. There was no significant correlation between intraocular pressure and body mass index (r=0.05, p=0.74). CONCLUSION: Compared to healthy children, obese children had greater binocular retinal nerve fiber layer thickness asymmetry and thinner retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layers in several sectors. Blood lipid levels were not associated with retinal thickness or optic disc parameters in obese children.","Pekel, Evre; Altincik, Selda Ayça; Pekel, Gökhan",Arq Bras Oftalmol,,247

The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) proposed a reporting language for CT findings related to COVID-19 and defined four CT categories: typical, indeterminate, atypical, and negative. Objectives: To retrospectively evaluate the chest CT characteristics of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients and Methods: A total of 115 hospitalized laboratory-verified COVID-19 cases, underdoing chest CT scan, were included in this study from April 30 to May 15, 2020. Of 115 cases, 53 were discharged from the hospital, and 62 expired. The initial clinical features and chest CT scans were assessed for the type, pattern, distribution, and frequency of lesions.

496001,Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis Reveals Key Candidate Genes and Cytokine Pathways Involved in COVID-19 After Rhinovirus Infection in Asthma Patients,2020,"Purpose: COVID-19 related pan- India lockdown brought teleophthalmology to the forefront. The study ventures to understand the relevance of this modality in a government setup. The objective is to understand the feasibility, clinical profile and addressability of patients using teleconsultation in ophthalmology at a tertiary care government medical university during the COVID-19 Lockdown in India. Methods: An online survey targeting faculty members and resident doctors in a tertiary eye center in a government medical university in north India was conducted. Various aspects of teleconsultation were analyzed including the number and preferential mode of consultations, commonest complaints and diagnoses made. Frequency and factors mandating physical examination of patients was also analyzed. Results: The questionnaire was sent to 40 ophthalmologists of whom 38 responded. A total of 4880 teleconsultations were given. The commonest mode of communication was by WhatsApp messages (65.6%) and E-mail was the least preferred medium. More than 80% consultations were from previously seen patients. Red eye was the commonest presenting complaint (22.8%), followed by watering (18.7%) and foreign body sensation (14.5%). Computer vision syndrome was the commonest diagnosis (25.9%) followed by conjunctivitis (17.7%) and refractive error (17.7%). About 40% required physical examination, mostly due to uncertain diagnosis (22%) or inadequate response to prescribed treatment (19%). Conclusion: Teleconsultation was feasible in a government medical university for providing ophthalmic services during lockdown. WhatsApp was the preferred communication modality, computer vision syndrome was the most frequent tentative diagnosis and approximately 60% did not require in-person physical examination.","Pandey, Nitika; Srivastava, Rajat M; Kumar, Gaurav; Katiyar, Vishal; Agrawal, Siddharth",Indian J Ophthalmol,,247

498317,The mechanism and treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize the engagement of students enrolled in the fifth year of pharmaceutical studies in the management of the health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify some determinants of this engagement during this period. METHODS: With the health crisis, new missions have been entrusted during hospital internships, whereas certain internship sites were removed in hospitals and as part of the health service organization. In addition, some students who were no longer in internship returned to the hospital setting for helping in critical activities. Student engagement was studied with a questionnaire and focus groups including six or seven students in each group. RESULTS: Forty-three students participated to the study. The answers to the questionnaire highlighted that they were engaged, that they usually did not wait for compensation, and that most of them were satisfied by their activity during the crisis. The thematic analysis demonstrated that despite a feeling of frustration, which was often associated with the interruption of rewarded activities, and despite a stress due to the particular context, student engagement was supported by a better consideration of the pharmacist's role as a professional in public health and by a better acknowledgement of this role by other health professionals. CONCLUSION: This level of engagement is particularly encouraging because it is the witness of the ability of pharmacists to mobilize for general interest, even in adverse context.","Spiesser-Robelet, Laurence; Baglin, Isabelle; Moal, Frédéric; Lagarce, Frédéric; Eveillard, Matthieu",Ann. pharm. fr,,247
498460,Malignant Cerebral Ischemia in A COVID-19 Infected Patient: Case Review and Histopathological Findings,2020,"BACKGROUND: While the physical health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are regularly publicly available, the mental health toll on Canadians is unknown. This article examines the self-perceived mental health of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores associations with various concerns after accounting for socioeconomic and health factors. DATA: The cross-sectional Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 1 collected information related to COVID-19 in late March and early April 2020 concerning labour market participation, behaviours, and health for the Canadian population 15 years and older living in the 10 provinces. METHODS: Socioeconomic and health characteristics of respondents as well as concerns about the impact of COVID-19 were examined to determine differences in experiencing excellent or very good compared to good, fair or poor perceived mental health. RESULTS: Just over half of Canadians aged 15 and older (54%) reported excellent or very good mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several concerns were also associated with mental health. Notably, after considering the effects of socioeconomic and health characteristics, women, youth, individuals with a physical health condition and those who were very or extremely concerned with family stress from confinement were less likely to report excellent or very good mental health. DISCUSSION: These findings point to particular risks for lower perceived mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results highlight various concerns of Canadians which may be associated with mental health, in particular, family stress in the home.","Findlay, Leanne C; Arim, Rubab; Kohen, Dafna",Health Rep,,247

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for digital therapeutics has arguably never been greater. However, despite new advances in technology and a heightened interest due to the pandemic, digital therapeutics remain underdeveloped and underutilized. In this paper, we briefly review practical applications and emerging advances in digital therapeutic platforms that target motor and non-motor signs and healthy lifestyle behaviors such as regular exercise, a healthy diet and optimal sleep hygiene habits. Future applications which could transform personalized self-management and patient care are presented. Opportunities, drawbacks and barriers to access are discussed.","Ellis, Terry D; Earhart, Gammon M",Journal of Parkinson&#039;s disease (Online),,247
499038,Complement and protection from tissue injury in COVID-19,2020,"Major hyperparameters which affect fuzzy time series (FTS) forecasting are the number of partitions, length of partition intervals in the universe of discourse, and the fuzzy order. There are very few studies which have considered an integrated solution to optimize all the hyperparameters. In this paper, we strive to achieve optimum values of all three hyperparameters for fuzzy time series forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. We specifically propose two techniques, namely nested PSO and exhaustive search PSO for determining the optimal interval length, as an augmentation to the FTS-PSO model that optimizes the interval length and the fuzzy order. Nested PSO has two PSO loops: (i) the inner PSO optimizes the combination of fuzzy order and boundaries of intervals for a given number of partitions defined by the outer loop, and the resultant cost is fed back to the outer PSO;(ii) the outer PSO optimizes the number of partitions to reduce the cost while meeting the defined constraint. Exhaustive search PSO also has two loops where the inner loop is similar to nested PSO while the outer loop iterates over a pre-defined search space of number of partitions. We analyze the effectiveness of the two approaches by comparing with ARIMA, FbProphet, and the state-of-the-art FTS and FTS-PSO models. We adopt COVID-19 highly affected 10 countries worldwide to perform forecasting of coronavirus confirmed cases. We consider two phases of COVID-19 spread, one from the year 2020 and another from 2021. Our study provides an analytical aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic, and aims to achieve optimal number and length of intervals along with fuzzy order for FTS forecasting of COVID-19. The results prove that the exhaustive FTS-PSO outperformed all the methods whereas nested FTS-PSO performed moderately well.","Kumar, Naresh Susan Seba",Applied Soft Computing,,247
499281,Proven Fatal Invasive Aspergillosis in a Patient with COVID-19 and Staphylococcus aureus Pneumonia,2021,"Introduction: Historically traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used as treatment during epidemics. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic patients evidence suggests that the use of TCM has provided health benefits and has been successfully used to control the spread of the disease in China. The aim of this study was to systematically explore the TCM formulae which have been used for the prevention and treatment of pneumonia or 'pestilence' to investigate their compatibility with the Chinese materia medica (CMM) and understand their potential mechanisms in the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: Frequency analysis was performed to identify high-frequency CMM and CMM groups. Association rules analysis was applied to investigate the compatibility law of CMMs and generate the commonly used CMM groups. Results: A total of 173 prescriptions were collected. The frequency analysis showed that seven out of ten high-frequency CMMs overlapped with Lianhua Qingwen Capsules (LHQWC), and five high-frequency pair-CMMs and four triple-CMMs were included in LHQWC, respectively. Then three groups of CMM were generated from association rules analysis, one of which is Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSGD). The results of the protein-protein interaction network and enrichment analysis showed that the potential therapeutic mechanisms of the generated prescriptions were involved in the anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and neuroprotective effects. Conclusion: This study showed the importance of systematic research on TCM prescriptions and provided candidate CMM groups that have the potential to treat COVID-19. In vitro and in vivo experiments should be conducted to validate these network pharmacology results, which can provide more information for the development of potential antiviral drugs from TCM prescriptions. The combination of TCM treatment and modern medical approaches will benefit patients with COVID-19 and help to overcome the current epidemic.","Sun, Xiuli; Jiang, Jinhe; Wang, Yang; Liu, Shuying",Eur J Integr Med,,247
499282,Proven Fatal Invasive Aspergillosis in a Patient with COVID-19 and Staphylococcus aureus Pneumonia,2021,"A variety of pulmonary and systemic insults promote an inflammatory response causing increased vascular permeability, leading to the development of acute lung injury (ALI), a condition necessitating hospitalization and intensive care, or the more severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a disease with a high mortality rate. Further, COVID-19 pandemic-associated ARDS is now a major cause of mortality worldwide. The pathogenesis of ALI is explained by injury to both the vascular endothelium and the alveolar epithelium. The disruption of the lung endothelial and epithelial barriers occurs in response to both systemic and local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Studies that evaluate the association of genetic polymorphisms with disease risk did not yield many potential therapeutic targets to treat and revert lung injury. This failure is probably due in part to the phenotypic complexity of ALI/ARDS, and genetic predisposition may be obscured by the multiple environmental and behavioral risk factors. In the last decade, new research has uncovered novel epigenetic mechanisms that control ALI/ARDS pathogenesis, including histone modifications and DNA methylation. Enzyme inhibitors such as DNMTi and HDACi may offer new alternative strategies to prevent or reverse the vascular damage that occurs during lung injury. This review will focus on the latest findings on the molecular mechanisms of vascular damage in ALI/ARDS, the genetic factors that might contribute to the susceptibility for developing this disease, and the epigenetic changes observed in humans, as well as in experimental models of ALI/ADRS.","Bossardi Ramos, Ramon; Adam, Alejandro Pablo",Adv Exp Med Biol,,247

499663,Successful conduct of an acute stroke clinical trial during COVID,2021,"Cholangiopathies caused by biliary epithelial cell (BEC) injury represent a leading cause of liver failure. No effective pharmacologic therapies exist, and the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. We aimed to explore the mechanisms of bile duct repair after targeted BEC injury. Injection of intermedilysin into BEC-specific human CD59 (hCD59) transgenic mice induced acute and specific BEC death, representing a model to study the early signals that drive bile duct repair. Acute BEC injury induced cholestasis followed by CCR2+ monocyte recruitment and BEC proliferation. Using microdissection and next-generation RNA-Seq, we identified 5 genes, including Mapk8ip2, Cdkn1a, Itgb6, Rgs4, and Ccl2, that were most upregulated in proliferating BECs after acute injury. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed robust upregulation of integrin &#945;vß6 (ITGß6) expression in this BEC injury model, after bile duct ligation, and in patients with chronic cholangiopathies. Deletion of the Itgb6 gene attenuated BEC proliferation after acute bile duct injury. Macrophage depletion or Ccr2 deficiency impaired ITGß6 expression and BEC proliferation. In vitro experiments revealed that bile acid-activated monocytes promoted BEC proliferation through ITGß6. Our data suggest that BEC injury induces cholestasis, monocyte recruitment, and induction of ITGß6, which work together to promote BEC proliferation and therefore represent potential therapeutic targets for cholangiopathies.","Guillot, Adrien; Guerri, Lucia; Feng, Dechun; Kim, Seung-Jin; Ahmed, Yeni Ait; Paloczi, Janos; He, Yong; Schuebel, Kornel; Dai, Shen; Liu, Fengming; Pacher, Pal; Kisseleva, Tatiana; Qin, Xuebin; Goldman, David; Tacke, Frank; Gao, Bin",J. clin. invest,,247

This paper describes the response and expected recovery process for Western Australia, where a rapid and effective response was implemented. This has enabled an early transition into an expected recovery both in health and economic terms. The positive lessons learned from this experience are documented as they emerge in order to support other states and nations as they address this issue globally in the near-term and consider enduring improvements for the longer term. While the authors have personal experience in the WA context, wider observations across Australia and selected international benchmarks are also included. Key lessons include the importance of good health advice in Australia's interest; timely, synchronized and aligned action at all levels of government; a program of well communicated, aligned health and economic measures which support all in society allowing a very high level of appropriate community behaviour, ensuring the health system was not overloaded; innovation in telehealth, testing, pandemic modelling, and integrated operations which also allowed essential industries to continue; and strong border and travel controls with highly effective isolation preventing community spread, ultimately enabling rapid elimination of the disease from the hospital system. In combination, these demonstrate that in the case of Western Australia the result of first eliminating the disease from the community, and then reopening the economy progressively at a strong pace, has enabled a world leading outcome in both in health and economic terms. The lessons from this experience are widely applicable, shareable both as supporting service to other regions and through knowledge transfer.","Cavanagh, David; Hoey, Mark; Clark, Andrew; Small, Michael; Bailey, Paul; Watson, Jon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08918v1.pdf,247

501959,Pulmonary infarctions as the cause of bilateral cavitations in a patient with COVID-19,2020,"Head motion is a major confounding factor impairing the quality of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In particular, head motion can reduce analytical efficiency, and its effects are still present even after preprocessing. To examine the validity of motion removal and to evaluate the remaining effects of motion on the quality of the preprocessed fMRI data, a new metric of group quality control (QC), dissimilarity of functional connectivity, is introduced. Here, we investigate the association between head motion, represented by mean framewise displacement, and dissimilarity of functional connectivity by applying four preprocessing methods in two independent resting-state fMRI datasets: one consisting of healthy participants (N = 167) scanned in a 3T GE-Discovery 750 with longer TR (2.5 s), and the other of chronic back pain patients (N = 143) in a 3T Siemens Magnetom Prisma scanner with shorter TR (0.555 s). We found that dissimilarity of functional connectivity uncovers the influence of participant's motion, and this relationship is independent of population, scanner, and preprocessing method. The association between motion and dissimilarity of functional connectivity, and how the removal of high-motion participants affects this association, is a new strategy for group-level QC following preprocessing.","Yang, Lili; Wu, Bo; Fan, Linyu; Huang, Shishi; Vigotsky, Andrew D; Baliki, Marwan N; Yan, Zhihan; Apkarian, A Vania; Huang, Lejian",Hum. brain mapp,,247

Prior studies have shown a relationship between experiences of discrimination and poor mental health. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of perceived discrimination and psychological distress among FA living in Massachusetts from a survey collected during the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 133). Multiple regression analysis revealed that experiences of perceived discrimination were associated with psychological distress. Older participants were less likely to report psychological distress. Compared to men, womxn were more likely to report psychological distress. Our findings highlight the potential mental health consequences of perceived discrimination experienced by FA, which may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Maglalang, Mpdd Condor B.

503451,Providing Stroke Expertise across India,2021,"Most humidity-responsive polymeric actuators can only exhibit shape transformations between a planar shape in the dry state and a bended three-dimensional (3D) shape when exposed to moisture, and it is challenging to design and prepare hygroscopic actuators with programmable actuating behaviors displayed from sophisticated 3D structures. Herein, we demonstrate that the integration of shape memory property and surface treatment enabled hygromorphic responsivity endows a single-component polymer film with programmable moisture-driven actuating behaviors. The solvent-processed polyethylene-co-acrylic acid (EAA) copolymer film is soft and stretchable at room temperature, and has a good thermal-responsive shape memory property. By surface treatment using base/acid solutions, the reversible gradient conversion between carboxyl groups and carboxylate salts along the thickness direction enables the film to exhibit designed hygroscopic actuations. The shape memory property and moisture-driven actuating behaviors can be combined to realize 3D-3D morphing by first programming the films into 3D shapes and then conducting the surface treatments. Both shape programming and surface treatment processes can be reprogrammed to make the actuation behavior readily tunable. We also show that the created surface patterns can act as moisture-sensitive conducting paths to detect human breathes, and the combination of shape memory, moisture-responsive morphing and conductivity change leads to some interesting applications such as smart switch in conducting circuit. This work provides a new and general strategy for the design of advanced humidity-responsive actuators.","Ge, Yuhua; Wang, Hanxiao; Xue, Jieying; Jiang, Jinqiang; Liu, Zhaotie; Liu, Zhongwen; Li, Guo; Zhao, Yue",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,247
503632,Mandatory preoperative COVID-19 testing for cancer patients-Is it justified?,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in dramatic changes to sleep patterns and higher prevalence of insomnia, which threaten overall mental and physical health. We examined whether safety behaviors in response to COVID-19, worry in response to COVID-19, and depression predicted insomnia, with age, race, and sex as covariates. A community sample from the United States (n = 321, Mage = 40.02, SD = 10.54; 53.6% female) recruited using online crowdsourcing completed self-report measures in May of 2020 and again three months later. At baseline, our model accounted for 68.1% of the variance in insomnia, with depression as the only significant predictor (ß = .70, p < .001). In the longitudinal analyses, only baseline insomnia symptoms predicted 3-month follow-up insomnia symptoms (ß = .70, p < .001; 67.1% of variance). Of note, COVID-19 worry and some COVID-19 safety behaviors were related to 3-month follow-up safety behaviors, but not insomnia. Our findings demonstrated that depression is an important factor to consider for concurrent insomnia symptoms. Our results have implications regarding the development of interventions for insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest that clinicians should consider depression when assessing for and treating insomnia symptoms.","Pizzonia, Kendra L; Koscinski, Brandon; Suhr, Julie A; Accorso, Catherine; Allan, Darcey M; Allan, Nicholas P",Cogn Behav Ther,,247

504717,COVID-19: What Cancer Patients & Survivors Need to Know,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 causes the COVID-19 pandemic responsible for millions of deaths globally. Even with effective vaccines, the SARS-CoV-2 virus will likely maintain a hold in the human population through gaps in efficacy and vaccination and arising new strains. Therefore, understanding how SARS-Cov-2 causes such wide-spread tissue damage and developing targeted pharmacological treatments will be critical in fighting this virus and preparing for future outbreaks. Herein, we summarize the progress made thus far by using in vitro or in vivo models to investigate individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins and their pathogenic mechanisms. We grouped the SARS-CoV-2 proteins into three categories: host-entry, self-acting and host-interacting. This review focuses on the self-acting and host-interacting SARS-CoV-2 proteins and summarizes current knowledge on how these proteins promote virus replication and disrupt host systems, as well as drugs that target these virus- and interacting host proteins. Many of these drugs are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. Future coronavirus outbreaks will mostly likely be caused by new virus strains that evade the vaccines through mutations in host-entry proteins. Therefore, study of individual self-acting and host-interacting SARS-CoV-2 proteins for targeted therapeutic interventions is not only essential for fighting COVID-19, but also valuable against future coronavirus outbreaks.","van de Leemput, Joyce; Han, Zhe",Mol Cell Biol,,247

How these tests perform relative to one another is poorly understood. We evaluated the concordance between the Roche Diagnostics cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 test and a laboratory-developed test (LDT) real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction based on a modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in samples submitted to the Clinical Laboratories of the Mount Sinai Health System. A total of 1006 nasopharyngeal swabs in universal transport medium from persons under investigation were tested for SARS-CoV-2 as part of routine clinical care using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 test with subsequent evaluation by the LDT. Cycle threshold values were analyzed and interpreted as either positive (""detected"" or ""presumptive positive""), negative (not detected), inconclusive, or invalid. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. The cobas SARS-CoV-2 test reported 706 positive and 300 negative results. The LDT reported 640 positive, 323 negative, 34 inconclusive, and 9 invalid results. When excluding inconclusive and invalid results, the overall percent agreement between the two platforms was 95.8%. Cohen's &#954; coefficient was 0.904 (95% confidence interval, 0.875-0.933), suggesting almost perfect agreement between both platforms. An overall discordance rate of 4.2% between the two systems may reflect differences in primer sequences, assay limit of detection, or other factors, highlighting the importance of comparing the performance of different testing platforms.","Pujadas, Elisabet; Ibeh, Nnaemeka; Hernandez, Matthew M; Waluszko, Aneta; Sidorenko, Tatyana; Flores, Vanessa; Shiffrin, Biana; Chiu, Numthip; Young-Francois, Alicia; Nowak, Michael D; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto E; Sordillo, Emilia M; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Houldsworth, Jane; Gitman, Melissa R",J. med. virol,,247
505060,Challenges in Managing Pericardial Disease Related to Post Viral Syndrome After COVID-19 Infection,2021,"Despite initial reports, renal involvement, including acute kidney injury, has emerged as a serious complication of COVID-19 disease, particularly in critically ill patients. The reported prevalence varies considerably, which may reflect reporting practices, although differences in pre-existing comorbidities and socioeconomic factors, and differences between ethnic groups, almost certainly contribute. Renal involvement may present as an active urinary sediment or as changes in serum creatinine levels and urine output leading to acute kidney injury. In common with acute kidney injury complicating critical illness, the cause is often multifactorial and often presents as part of a multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Treatment is, in the main, supportive, with kidney replacement therapy required in nearly 25% of reported cases. Few data currently exist as to the long-term burden of COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury but evidence suggests that only approximately one-third of patients are discharged with recovered renal function.","Alvarez-Belon, Lucas; Sarnowski, Alexander; Forni, Lui G",Br J Hosp Med (Lond),,247

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Elective surgeries during the pandemic was limited acutely. Access to surgical care was restored in a recovery phase but backlogs and societal shifts are hypothesized to impact surgical access. METHODS: Adults with electronic health record orders for procedures (""procedure requests""), from March 16 to August 25, 2019 and March 16 to August 25, 2020, were included. Logistic regression was performed for requested procedures that were not scheduled. Linear regression was performed for wait time from request to scheduled or completed procedure. RESULTS: The number of patients with procedure requests decreased 20.8%, from 26,789 in 2019 to 21,162 in 2020. Patients aged 36-50 and >65âyears, those speaking non-English languages, those with Medicare or no insurance, and those living >â100 miles away had disproportionately larger decreases. Requested procedures had significantly increased adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of not being scheduled for patients with primary languages other than English, Spanish, or Cantonese (aOR 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.28); unpartnered marital status (aOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07-1.37); uninsured or self-pay (aOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.53-2.70). Significantly longer wait times were seen for patients aged 36-65âyears; with Medi-Cal insurance; from ZIP codes with lower incomes; and from ZIP codes >â100 miles away. CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to elective surgeries decreased during the pandemic recovery phase with disparities based on patient age, language, marital status, insurance, socioeconomic status, and distance from care. Steps to address modifiable disparities have been taken.","Lin, Joseph A; Braun, Hillary J; Schwab, Marisa E; Pierce, Logan; Sosa, Julie A; Wick, Elizabeth C",Ann. surg,,247

We collect 60 initial policy responses related to urban mobility from cities around the world and analyze them based on the challenge they aim to address, the exact principles of smart growth and sustainable mobility that they encapsulate, as well as the level of ICT penetration. Our findings suggest that emerging strategies, although mainly temporary, are transformational, in line with the principles of smart growth and sustainable development.

Our objective is to assess whether and why the pandemic crisis affected food waste level. Unlike previous studies that addressed the issue at a consumer level, our research focuses on pre-consumption waste covering stages of the agrifood supply chain from input suppliers to retailers. Considering the importance of waste reduction for the sustainability of food production, the study provides an insight into the ability of the agrifood supply chain to cope with a major shock and its resilience. A multinomial logit regression model is used to estimate the effect of Covid-19, testing whether the ability to innovate, the role in the supply chain, the magnitude of the shock and policy support were drivers of changes in food waste. We find that three main factors affect the change in a firm’s food-waste level during the Covid-19 pandemic: The magnitude of the disruption of the sale channel, the firms’ ability to adapt the business model to the new pandemic environment, and the adoption of public policies mitigating the lockdown effects. The first driver was associated with an increase in food waste, while the others were associated with a decrease.","Di Marcantonio, Federica Twum Edward Kyei Russo Carlo",Agronomy,,247

In this work, we focus on the identification of distorted facts, in the form of unreliable and conspiratorial narratives in election-related tweets, to characterize discourse manipulation prior to the election. We apply a detection model to separate factual from unreliable (or conspiratorial) claims analyzing a dataset of 242 million election-related tweets. The identified claims are used to investigate targeted topics of disinformation, and conspiracy groups, most notably the far-right QAnon conspiracy group. Further, we characterize account engagements with unreliable and conspiracy tweets, and with the QAnon conspiracy group, by political leaning and tweet types. Finally, using a regression discontinuity design, we investigate whether Twitter's actions to curb QAnon activity on the platform were effective, and how QAnon accounts adapt to Twitter's restrictions.","Sharma, Karishma; Ferrara, Emilio; Liu, Yan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.08319v1.pdf,247

508895,First Wave of COVID-19 in French Patients with Cystic Fibrosis,2020,"AIMS: To explore relationships between mental health problems, mental health shame, self-compassion and average length of sleep in UK nursing students. The increasing mental health problems in nursing students may be related to a strong sense of shame they experience for having a mental health problem. Self-compassion has been identified as a protective factor for mental health and shame in other student populations. Further, studies highlight the importance of sleep relating to mental health. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design. METHODS: A convenient sampling of 182 nursing students at a university in the East Midlands completed a paper-based questionnaire regarding these four constructs, from February to April 2019. Correlation, regression and mediation analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Mental health problems were positively related to shame and negatively related to self-compassion and sleep. Mental health shame positively predicted and self-compassion negatively predicted mental health problems: sleep was not a significant predictor of mental health problems. Lastly, self-compassion completely mediated the impacts of sleep on mental health problems (negative relationship between mental health problems and sleep was fully explained by self-compassion). CONCLUSION: The importance of self-compassion was highlighted as it can reduce mental health problems and shame. Self-compassion can protect nursing students from mental distress when they are sleep deprived. IMPACT: Nurses and nursing students are required to work irregular hours (e.g. COVID-19) and mental distress can cause serious consequences in clinical practice. Our findings suggest that nurturing self-compassion can protect their mental health and the negative impacts of sleep deprivation on mental health.","Kotera, Yasuhiro; Cockerill, Vicky; Chircop, James G E; Forman, Dawn",,,247

509225,Pathology of TB/COVID-19 Co-Infection: The phantom menace,2020,"The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX) represents an unprecedented global collaboration facilitating the development and distribution of vaccines for COVID-19. COVAX pools and channels funds from state and non-state actors to promising vaccine candidates, and has started to distribute successful candidates to participating states. The WHO, one of the leaders of COVAX, recognised vaccine doses would initially be scarce, and therefore, prepared a two-staged allocation mechanism they considered fair. In the first stage, vaccine doses are distributed equally among participating countries, while in the second stage vaccine doses will be allocated according to a country's need. Ethicists have questioned whether this is the fairest distribution-they argue a country's need should be taken into account from the start and correspondingly, have proposed a framework that treats individuals with equal moral concern, aims to minimise harm and gives priority to the worst-off. In this paper, we seek to explore these concerns by comparing COVAX's allocation mechanism to a targeted allocation based on need. We consider which distribution would more likely maximise well-being and align with principles of equity. We conclude that although in theory, a targeted distribution in proportion to a country's need would be more morally justifiable, when political realities are taken into account, an equal distribution seems more likely to avert a greater number of deaths and reduce disparities.","Sharma, Siddhanth; Kawa, Nisrine; Gomber, Apoorva",J. med. ethics,,247

We conducted a retrospective study including 13 young patients who died of COVID-19 and 40 matched survivors. Logistic regression was employed to characterize the risk factors of mortality in young obese COVID-19 patients. Most of the young deceased COVID-19 patients were mild cases at the time of admission, but the disease progressed rapidly featured by a higher severity of patchy shadows (100.00% vs 48.70%; P = .006), pleural thickening (61.50% vs 12.80%; P = .012), and mild pericardial effusion (76.90% vs 0.00%; P < .001). Most importantly, the deceased patients manifested higher body mass index (odds ratio [OR] = 1.354; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.075-1.704; P = .010), inflammation-related index C-reactive protein (OR = 1.014; 95% CI = 1.003-1.025; P = .014), cardiac injury biomarker hs-cTnI (OR = 1.420; 95% CI = 1.112-1.814; P = .005), and increased coagulation activity biomarker D-dimer (OR = 418.7; P = .047), as compared with that of survivors. Our data support that obesity could be a risk factor associated with high mortality in young COVID-19 patients, whereas aggravated inflammatory response, enhanced cardiac injury, and increased coagulation activity are likely to be the mechanisms contributing to the high mortality.","Zhang, Fengqin; Xiong, Ying; Wei, Yanqiu; Hu, Yi; Wang, Feng; Li, Gang; Liu, Kui; Du, Ronghui; Wang, Cong-Yi; Zhu, Wenzhen",J. med. virol,,247
509302,"Thinking Globally, Acting Locally - The U.S. Response to Covid-19",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Following two coronaviral epidemics in 2002 and 2012, December 2019 saw the emergence of a potentially fatal coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2, which originated in Wuhan, China. While most coronaviruses are responsible for mild respiratory infections, they have been demonstrated to be neuroinvasive and neurotropic for over three decades. In this review, we assess whether SARS-CoV-2 follows this trend and if the neuroinvasive potential of this novel coronavirus is worthy of further investigation. METHODS: To obtain sources for this study, we performed an online search through Pubmed, Researchgate and Google Scholar, finding 537 articles. After analysing them according to PRISMA, we included 14 in this review. DISCUSSION: Data regarding neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 is scarce and mostly inconsistent. There are however identifiable trends which might provide a basis for future research. There is strong evidence that this novel coronavirus may be neuroinvasive and could cause a wide array of neurological symptoms and complications. Cerebrospinal fluid testing may shed more light on the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in the central nervous system. Clarification of the respiratory failure mechanisms requires post mortem examinations and brain tissue analysis, and further research is of the utmost importance. However, we strongly believe that the existing evidence is enough to raise awareness among clinicians and help guide them through the diagnosis and optimal therapy of COVID-19 patients.","Slyk, Stanislaw; Domitrz, Izabela",Neurol. neurochir. pol,,247

Given the novelty of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative agent of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, little is known about the pathophysiology and phenotypic expressions of this new infectious disease nor the optimal treatment approach. STUDY SELECTION: From inception to July 10, 2020, repeated PubMed and open Web searches have been done by the scientific section collaborative group members of the European Society of Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care. DATA EXTRACTION: There is little in the way of clinical research in children affected by coronavirus disease 2019, apart from descriptive data and epidemiology. DATA SYNTHESIS: Even though basic treatment and organ support considerations seem not to differ much from other critical illness, such as pediatric septic shock and multiple organ failure, seen in PICUs, some specific issues must be considered when caring for children with severe coronavirus disease 2019 disease. CONCLUSIONS: In this clinical guidance article, we review the current clinical knowledge of coronavirus disease 2019 disease in critically ill children and discuss some specific treatment concepts based mainly on expert opinion based on limited experience and the lack of any completed controlled trials in children at this time.","Rimensberger, Peter C; Kneyber, Martin C J; Deep, Akash; Bansal, Mehak; Hoskote, Aparna; Javouhey, Etienne; Jourdain, Gilles; Latten, Lynne; MacLaren, Graeme; Morin, Luc; Pons-Odena, Marti; Ricci, Zaccaria; Singh, Yogen; Schlapbach, Luregn J; Scholefield, Barnaby R; Terheggen, Ulrich; Tissières, Pierre; Tume, Lyvonne N; Verbruggen, Sascha; Brierley, Joe",Pediatric critical care medicine,,247

At present neither vaccination nor therapies are available. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of RNA-sequencing data from three studies employing human lung epithelial cells. Of these one focused on lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. We aimed at identifying genes co-expressed with angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) the human cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and unveiled several genes correlated or inversely correlated with high significance, among the most significant of these was the transmembrane serine protease 4 (TMPRSS4). Serine proteases are known to be involved in the infection process by priming the virus spike protein. Pathway analysis revealed virus infection amongst the most significantly correlated pathways. Gene Ontologies revealed regulation of viral life cycle, immune responses, pro-inflammatory responses- several interleukins such as IL6, IL1, IL20 and IL33, IFI16 regulating the interferon response to a virus, chemo-attraction of macrophages, and cellular stress resulting from activated Reactive Oxygen Species. We believe that this dataset will aid in a better understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying COVID-19.","Wruck, Wasco; Adjaye, James",Sci Rep,,247

510202,Supraglottic airway and aerosol generation: Reality or simulation?,2021,"BACKGROUND: There are limited data on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes at a national level, and none after 60 days of follow up. The aim of this study was to describe national, 60-day all-cause mortality associated with COVID-19, and to identify risk factors associated with admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including the first consecutive 5000 patients with COVID-19 in Qatar who completed 60 days of follow up by June 17, 2020. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. In addition, we explored risk factors for admission to ICU. RESULTS: Included patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 28 and April 17, 2020. The majority (4436, 88.7%) were males and the median age was 35 years [interquartile range (IQR) 28-43]. By 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, 14 patients (0.28%) had died, 10 (0.2%) were still in hospital, and two (0.04%) were still in ICU. Fatal COVID-19 cases had a median age of 59.5 years (IQR 55.8-68), and were mostly males (13, 92.9%). All included pregnant women (26, 0.5%), children (131, 2.6%), and healthcare workers (135, 2.7%) were alive and not hospitalized at the end of follow up. A total of 1424 patients (28.5%) required hospitalization, out of which 108 (7.6%) were admitted to ICU. Most frequent co-morbidities in hospitalized adults were diabetes (23.2%), and hypertension (20.7%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that older age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.041, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.022-1.061 per year increase; P < 0.001], male sex (aOR 4.375, 95% CI 1.964-9.744; P < 0.001), diabetes (aOR 1.698, 95% CI 1.050-2.746; P 0.031), chronic kidney disease (aOR 3.590, 95% CI 1.596-8.079, P 0.002), and higher BMI (aOR 1.067, 95% CI 1.027-1.108 per unit increase; P 0.001), were all independently associated with increased risk of ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: In a relatively younger national cohort with a low co-morbidity burden, COVID-19 was associated with low all-cause mortality. Independent risk factors for ICU admission included older age, male sex, higher BMI, and co-existing diabetes or chronic kidney disease.","Omrani, Ali S; Almaslamani, Muna A; Daghfal, Joanne; Alattar, Rand A; Elgara, Mohamed; Shaar, Shahd H; Ibrahim, Tawheeda B H; Zaqout, Ahmed; Bakdach, Dana; Akkari, Abdelrauof M; Baiou, Anas; Alhariri, Bassem; Elajez, Reem; Husain, Ahmed A M; Badawi, Mohamed N; Abid, Fatma Ben; Abu Jarir, Sulieman H; Abdalla, Shiema; Kaleeckal, Anvar; Choda, Kris; Chinta, Venkateswara R; Sherbash, Mohamed A; Al-Ismail, Khalil; Abukhattab, Mohammed; Ait Hssain, Ali; Coyle, Peter V; Bertollini, Roberto; Frenneaux, Michael P; Alkhal, Abdullatif; Al-Kuwari, Hanan M",BMC Infect Dis,,247

This article represents a case study of group dynamics in which we reflect on our own experience as psychiatric residents at a Boston-area hospital system in the era of COVID-19 and apply Wilfred Bion's concepts of the ""work group"" and the ""basic assumption group"" processes of group operation. We assess dynamics between trainees and administrative leadership both at baseline and in the current pandemic. Since navigation through crises is more effective if group leadership recognizes and responds to basic assumption behaviors, we propose suggestions to enable health system administration to successfully lead health care organizations through periods of societal turmoil. We posit that these principles apply across settings, specialties, and provider types. In addition, we use our observations to indicate future directions for expanding Bion's theories in the contemporary context.","Lim, Christopher T; Harris, Zachary B; Caan, Marissa P",Psychodyn Psychiatry,,247

512137,Comorbidities and COVID-19,2020,"Concussion is a frequent injury in many sports and is also common in para athletes. However, there is a paucity of concussion research related to para sport, and prior International Concussion in Sport (CIS) consensus papers have not substantively addressed this population. To remedy this and to improve concussion care provided to para athletes, the concussion in para sport (CIPS) multidisciplinary expert group was created. This group analysed and discussed in-depth para athlete-specific issues within the established key clinical domains of the current (2017) consensus statement on CIS. Due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the group held all meetings by video conferencing. The existing Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 5 (SCAT5) for the immediate on-field and office-based off-field assessment of concussion was evaluated as part of this process, to identify any para athlete-specific concerns. Regular preparticipation and periodic health examinations are essential to determine a baseline reference point for concussion symptoms but pose additional challenges for the interpreting clinician. Further considerations for concussion management for the para athlete are required within the remove, rest, reconsider and refer consensus statement framework. Considering return to sport (RTS), the 2017 CIS consensus statement has limitations when considering the RTS of the para athlete. Case-by-case decision making related to RTS following concussion is imperative for para athletes. Additional challenges exist for the evaluation and management of concussion in para athletes. There is a need for greater understanding of existing knowledge gaps and attitudes towards concussion among athlete medical staff, coaches and para athletes. Future research should investigate the use and performance of common assessment tools in the para athlete population to better guide their clinical application and inform potential modifications. Concussion prevention strategies and sport-specific rule changes, such as in Para Alpine Skiing and Cerebral Palsy Football, also should be carefully considered to reduce the occurrence of concussion in para athletes.","Weiler, Richard; Blauwet, Cheri; Clarke, David; Dalton, Kristine; Derman, Wayne; Fagher, Kristina; Gouttebarge, Vincent; Kissick, James; Lee, Kenneth; Lexell, Jan; Van de Vliet, Peter; Verhagen, Evert; Webborn, Nick; Ahmed, Osman Hassan",Br. j. sports med,,247

513527,A Diabetic Patient With 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) Infection Who Recovered and Was Discharged From Hospital,2020,"The placenta is the primary organ responsible for deactivating maternal glucocorticoids and reducing fetal exposure. Glucocorticoid use during pregnancy is a common treatment for asthma, allergies, and COVID-19. Several studies have reported adverse effects including intrauterine growth restriction as a result of glucocorticoid exposure, yet little is known about the mechanisms by which short and long-term maternal glucocorticoid exposures affect placental biology and fetal development. To better understand the role of glucocorticoids on placental and fetal outcomes, we used a mouse model exposed to the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (Dex), prior to and throughout gestation. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in mice with a treatment arm of Dex exposure and water exposure as control. Virgin C57Bl/6J female mice were single-housed at 11 weeks of age, and Dex was introduced in the drinking water as a 1mg/kg/day dose. After one week of treatment, mice were bred with age-matched virgin males. Dam body composition, food, and water intake were monitored weekly. Maternal insulin sensitivity, pup survival rate, litter size, and pup birth weight at postnatal day (PND) 0.5 were also assessed. Dams treated with Dex lost significant lean mass after one week of treatment. Dex treatment did not appear to affect the dams’ ability to get pregnant, as both groups carried pups to term with similar lengths of gestation (p=0.838). Water and Dex-treated dams gained comparable weight during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy, however, the Dex group gained less lean mass than the water group during the third trimester. At PND0.5, Dex dams had fewer pups with a 40% reduction in litter size (p=0.01) and lighter pups with a 37% reduction in offspring weight (p&amp;lt;0.001), indicating substantial intrauterine growth restriction. All pups of Dex-treated dams died by PND1. Attempts to rescue pups of Dex-dams by cross-fostering with water-treated nursing dams or by feeding the pups 10% glucose at PND0.5 failed by PND1. These results demonstrate a novel finding regarding the chronic use of glucocorticoids before and during conception and pregnancy. The reduction in both pup weight and late-pregnancy maternal weight gain suggests potential growth restriction or placental insufficiency. Further molecular studies during multiple time points of gestation will help elucidate the mechanisms at play.","El Habbal, Noura Mulcahy Molly C.; Redd, JeAnna R.; Bridges, Dave",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,247

This study describes the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children with cancer or hematologic disorders treated at a large children's hospital. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Center from January 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020. All patients with a primary hematology-oncology diagnosis and SARS-CoV-2 positivity by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were identified. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical record. Descriptive analyses were performed to evaluate COVID-19-related outcomes and risk factors for severe disease in this population. We identified 109 patients with COVID-19 disease, including 52 hematology, 51 oncology, and 6 HSCT patients; median age was 10.3 years (IQR 4.4-15.9), and 58.7% were male. Seventy-four percent of the patients were managed in the outpatient setting. Patients with sickle cell disease were more likely to require hospitalization. ICU care was needed in 8% (n = 9) of the entire cohort, and mechanical ventilation was required in 6.4% (6 oncology patients, 1 hematology patient). COVID-19 contributed to the deaths of two cancer patients. No deaths occurred in hematology or HSCT patients. In conclusion, the risk of severe COVID-19 complications is slightly higher in pediatric hematology-oncology patients than in the general pediatric population but lower than initially feared. For most asymptomatic patients, primary disease management may continue as planned, but treatment decisions must be individualized.","Kamdar, Kala Y; Kim, Taylor O; Doherty, Erin E; Pfeiffer, Thomas M; Qasim, Shawki L; Suell, Mary Nell; Yates, Amber M; Blaney, Susan M",Pediatr Hematol Oncol,,247

The study aimed to investigate the role of soluble (s)CD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels in predicting disease severity and characterize peripheral blood monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (COVID-19 subjects). Methods: On admission, in COVID-19 subjects sCD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels, and peripheral blood monocyte and DC subsets were compared to healthy donors (HDs). According to clinical outcome, COVID-19 subjects were divided into ARDS and non-ARDS groups. Results: Compared to HDs, COVID-19 subjects showed higher sCD163 (p<0.0001) and sCD14 (p<0.0001) plasmatic levels. We observed higher sCD163 plasmatic levels in the ARDS group compared to the non-ARDS one (p=0.002). The cut-off for sCD163 plasmatic level greater than 2032 ng/ml was predictive of disease severity (AUC: 0.6786, p=0.0022; sensitivity 56.7% [CI: 44.1-68.4] specificity 73.8% [CI: 58.9-84.7]).

Compared to HDs, COVID-19 subjects showed lower percentages of non-classical (p=0.0012) and intermediate monocytes (p=0.0447), slanDCs (p<0.0001), myeloid DCs (mDCs, p<0.0001), and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs, p=0.0014). Compared to the non-ARDS group, the ARDS group showed lower percentages of non-classical monocytes (p=0.0006), mDCs (p=0.0346), and pDCs (p=0.0492). Conclusions: The increase in sCD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels, observed on hospital admission in COVID-19 subjects, especially in those who developed ARDS, and the correlations of these monocyte/macrophage activation markers with typical inflammatory markers of COVID-19 pneumonia, underline their potential use to assess the risk of progression of the disease. In an early stage of the disease, the assessment of sCD163 plasmatic levels could have clinical utility in predicting the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Zingaropoli, Maria Antonella; Nijhawan, Parni; Carraro, Anna; Pasculli, Patrizia; Zuccalà, Paola; Perri, Valentina; Marocco, Raffaella; Kertusha, Blerta; Siccardi, Guido; Del Borgo, Cosmo; Curtolo, Ambrogio; Ajassa, Camilla; Iannetta, Marco; Ciardi, Maria Rosa; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria; Lichtner, Miriam",Front Immunol,,247

In computer science, this represents a typical problem of machine learning over incomplete or limited data in early epidemic Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.","Fong, Simon James; Li, Gloria; Dey, Nilanjan; Crespo, Rubén González; Herrera-Viedma, Enrique",Appl Soft Comput,,247

How well informed are the individuals who choose these sources as the main sources of information? From a questionnaire administered to 244 individuals in Portugal, during the first week of the state of emergency (March 2020), this research seeks to identify how people gained access to information about COVID-19, how they acted critically towards the various sources and how they assess the reliability of different media Finally, it analyzes the association between the type of medium chosen and adherence to misinformation content about the virus The results reveal the existence of a phenomenon of dependence on the media, with a strong exposure (both active and accidental) to informative content, with conventional media being privileged as the main source, and positively distinguished in terms of confidence Finally, a statistically significant association of a positive sign was identified between the use of social media as the main source and the acceptance of misinformation","Ferreira, Gil Baptista Borges Susana",Journalism and Media,,247

It has been reported also in patients with COVID-19, Hodgkin disease and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We analyzed the clinical relevance of Low T3 syndrome in COVID-19 patients and, in particular, in those with associated hematological malignancies. METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients, hospitalized during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Sant'Andrea University Hospital in Rome, were subdivided in 38 patients (Group A), showing low levels of FT3, and in 24 patients (Group B), with normal FT3 serum values. During the acute phase of the disease, we measured serum, radiologic and clinical disease severity markers and scores, in search of possible correlations with FT3 serum values. In addition, in 6 COVID-19 patients, 4 with Low T3 syndrome, including 2 with a hematological malignancy, and 2 with normal FT3 values, we performed, high-dimensional single-cell analysis by mass cytometry, multiplex cytokine assay and gene expression profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). RESULTS: Low FT3 serum values were correlated with increased Absolute Neutrophil Count, NLR and dNLR ratios and with reduced total count of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Low FT3 values correlated also with increased levels of inflammation, tissue damage and coagulation serum markers as well as with SOFA, LIPI and TSS scores. The CyTOF analysis demonstrated reduction of the effector memory and terminal effector subtypes of the CD4+ T lymphocytes. Multiplex cytokine assay indicates that mainly IL-6, IP-10 and MCAF changes are associated with FT3 serum levels, particularly in patients with coexistent hematological malignancies. Gene expression analysis using Nanostring identified four genes differently expressed involved in host immune response, namely CD38, CD79B, IFIT3 and NLRP3. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that low FT3 serum levels are associated with severe COVID-19. Our multi-omics approach suggests that T3 is involved in the immune response in COVID-19 and coexistent hematological malignancy and new possible T3 target genes in these patients have been identified.","Sciacchitano, Salvatore; De Vitis, Claudia; D039,; Ascanio, Michela; Giovagnoli, Simonetta; De Dominicis, Chiara; Laghi, Andrea; Anibaldi, Paolo; Petrucca, Andrea; Salerno, Gerardo; Santino, Iolanda; Amodeo, Rachele; Simmaco, Maurizio; Napoli, Christian; Tafuri, Agostino; Di Napoli, Arianna; Sacconi, Andrea; Salvati, Valentina; Ciliberto, Gennaro; Fanciulli, Maurizio; Piaggio, Giulia; de Latouliere, Luisa; Ricci, Alberto; Mancini, Rita",J Transl Med,,247

Therefore, the RBD is a promising vaccine target to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we report the development of an RBD protein-based vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 using self-assembling Helicobacter pylori-bullfrog ferritin nanoparticles as an antigen delivery system. RBD-ferritin protein purified from mammalian cells efficiently assembled into 24-mer nanoparticles. Sixteen- to 20-month-old ferrets were vaccinated with RBD-ferritin nanoparticles (RBD nanoparticles) by intramuscular or intranasal inoculation. All vaccinated ferrets with RBD nanoparticles produced potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, vaccinated ferrets demonstrated efficient protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, showing no fever, body weight loss, or clinical symptoms. Furthermore, vaccinated ferrets showed rapid clearance of infectious virus in nasal washes and lungs as well as of viral RNA in respiratory organs. This study demonstrates that spike RBD-nanoparticles are an effective protein vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.","Kim, Young-Il; Kim, Dokyun; Yu, Kwang-Min; Seo, Hogyu David; Lee, Shin-Ae; Casel, Mark Anthony B; Jang, Seung-Gyu; Kim, Stephanie; Jung, WooRam; Lai, Chih-Jen; Choi, Young Ki; Jung, Jae U",mBio (Online),,247

The UPR is comprised of three signaling pathways activated downstream of the ER membrane proteins IRE1, ATF6, and PERK. Once activated, these proteins initiate transcriptional and translational signaling that functions to alleviate ER stress, adapt cellular physiology, and dictate cell fate. Imbalances in UPR signaling are implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous, etiologically-diverse diseases including many neurodegenerative diseases, protein misfolding diseases, diabetes, ischemic disorders, and cancer. This has led to significant interest in establishing pharmacologic strategies to selectively modulate IRE1, ATF6, or PERK signaling to both ameliorate pathologic imbalances in UPR signaling implicated in these different diseases, and to define the importance of the UPR in diverse cellular and organismal contexts. Recently, there has been significant progress in the identification and characterization of UPR modulating compounds, providing new opportunities to probe the pathologic and potentially therapeutic implications of UPR signaling in human disease. Here, we describe currently available UPR modulating compounds, specifically highlighting the strategies used for their discovery and specific advantages and disadvantages in their application for probing UPR function. Furthermore, we discuss lessons learned from the application of these compounds in cellular and in vivo models to identify favorable compound properties that can help drive the further translational development of selective UPR modulators for human disease.","Grandjean, Julia M D; Wiseman, R Luke",J. biol. chem,,247

We used commercial online electronic services for medical students to learn sexual history-taking skills. METHODS: A total of 174 medical students viewed a lecture on sexual history taking and the PLISSIT model (Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestion, Intensive Therapy) and were then randomized into dyads. They arranged a time to meet online on Zoom with their partner, chose a simple sexual history case-history (male or female) from a small selection, and recorded the 5- to 6-minute sexual history within a 1-week time frame. Each student played a ""provider"" or ""patient"" and then switched roles with a new case. One of the course tutors, all sexual health practitioners, downloaded 10 videos randomly assigned to them asynchronously and viewed and commented on the interaction of each ""provider"" along with comments on what to improve in the sexual history. 2 weeks later after the remainder of the lectures in the course, a second, more complex set of 8 cases were provided, so students could move at their comfort pace and choose 1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Students were required to make 1 online post and 1 comment on another student's post for each case, on the experience, and associated issues arising, positive or negative. All comments were downloaded and analyzed by theme. RESULTS: Major themes included developing comfort in using sexual language, using simpler sexual terms suitable for patients, feeling confidence and mastery, excitement using technology developing clinical skills, surprise watching their performances and body language, observation of how they appeared to the ""patient,"" organizing sexual histories and incorporating PLISSIT model, ability to ask about context and relationships, and seeing the exercise as building on existing clinical skills training. Some expressed anxiety and nervousness, which by the second case had largely or completely dissipated. CONCLUSION: A readily replicable, secure, cheap cloud-based model to integrate sexual history training asynchronously was provided, with tutors' comments, and student skills development, and performance evaluated.

We aimed at assessing their level of knowledge and practice of preventive measures in a developing country setting. Methods: total enumeration of all CHWs in a rural local government area in southern Nigeria was carried out, using cross-sectional descriptive study design. Pretested self-administered 15-item questionnaire was used to assess knowledge of COVID-19 including basic epidemiology, virology, preventive measures and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Practice of preventive measures was also assessed. Each correct response to knowledge question contributed one unit to the total score which was converted to percentage. Total knowledge score of 50% or greater was considered satisfactory. Results: complete data was obtained from eighty-six (86) respondents with mean age of 36.3±8.9 years (18-54 years). Mean total knowledge score was 28.14±12.8% (6.7 to 53.3%), and 9.3% (n=8) had score of at least 50%. Correct responses to appropriate sequence of putting on and removing personal protective equipment (PPE) were 5.8% (n=5) and 8.1% (n=7), respectively. Regular practice of use of face masks, goggles, gloves, and hand hygiene was found to be 50% (n=43), 12.8% (n=11), 30.2% (n=26), and 56.4% (n=48), respectively. Conclusion: community health workers are grossly underprepared for provision of health education on COVID-19, due to their poor level of knowledge.

Globally well‐connected areas with high population densities are hence expected to be disproportionately affected by COVID‐19. This paper investigates the role of population density within the Netherlands, comparing hospitalisation and mortality related to COVID‐19 across municipalities. The paper finds that infections, hospitalisation and mortality related to COVID‐19 are not clearly correlated with the population density or urbanity of the municipality, also when controlling for age and public health factors. The paper concludes that while the public debate stresses the elevated risk of infections in cities, due to transgressive behaviour, the evidence in this paper suggests that the geography of the epidemic in the Netherlands is more complex.

The aim of the study was to identify metabolic biomarkers for multisite musculoskeletal pain (MSMP) by metabolomics with an extreme phenotype sampling strategy. The study participants (n = 610) were derived from the Newfoundland Osteoarthritis Study. Musculoskeletal pain was assessed using a self-reported pain questionnaire where painful sites were circled on a manikin by participants and the total number of painful sites were calculated. Targeted metabolomic profiling on fasting plasma samples was performed using the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit. Plasma cytokine concentrations including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data on blood cholesterol profiles were retrieved from participants' medical records. Demographic, anthropological, and clinical information was self-reported. The number of reported painful sites ranged between 0 and 21. Two hundred and five participants were included in the analysis comprising 83 who had ≥7 painful sites and 122 who had ≤1 painful site. Women and younger people were more likely to have MSMP (P ≤ 0.02). Multisite musculoskeletal pain was associated with a higher risk of having incontinence, worse functional status and longer period of pain, and higher levels of low-density lipoprotein and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all P ≤ 0.03). Among the 186 metabolites measured, 2 lysophosphatidylcholines, 1 with 26 carbons with no double bond and 1 with 28 carbons with 1 double bond, were significantly and positively associated with MSMP after adjusting for multiple testing with the Bonferroni method (P ≤ 0.0001) and could be considered as novel metabolic markers for MSMP.","Liu, Ming; Xie, Zikun; Costello, Christie A.; Zhang, Weidong; Chen, Liujun; Qi, Dake; Furey, Andrew; Randell, Edward W.; Rahman, Proton; Zhai, Guangju",Pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32833795/,247

The aim of this registry-based observational study was to report the characteristics and clinical outcomes of liver transplant (LT) recipients included in the French nationwide Registry of Solid Organ Transplant Recipients with Covid-19. METHODS: COVID-19 was diagnosed in patients who had a positive PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 or in presence of typical lung lesions on imaging or specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, management of immunosuppression, treatment for Covid-19, and clinical outcomes (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death) were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 104 patients, 67 were admitted to hospital and 37 were managed at home (including all 13 children). Hospitalized patients had a median age of 65.2 years (IQR: 58.1 − 73.2 years) and two thirds were men. Most common comorbidities included overweight (67.3%), hypertension (61.2%), diabetes (50.7%), cardiovascular disease (20.9%) and respiratory disease (16.4%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was identified after a median of 92.8 months (IQR: 40.1 − 194.7 months) from LT. During hospitalization, antimetabolites, mTOR inhibitor, and CNIs were withdrawn in 41.9%, 30.0% and 12.5% of patients, respectively. The composite endpoint of severe Covid-19 within 30 days after diagnosis was reached by 33.0% of the adult patients. The 30-day mortality rate was 20.0%, and 28.1% for hospitalized patients. Multivariate analysis identified that age was independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: In our large nationwide study, Covid-19 in LT recipients was associated with a high mortality rate.","Dumortier, Jérôme; Duvoux, Christophe; Roux, Olivier; Altieri, Mario; Barraud, Hélène; Besch, Camille; Caillard, Sophie; Coilly, Audrey; Conti, Filomena; Dharancy, Sébastien; Durand, François; Francoz, Claire; Garaix, Florentine; Houssel-Debry, Pauline; Kounis, Ilias; Lassailly, Guillaume; Laverdure, Noémie; Leroy, Vincent; Mallet, Maxime; Mazzola, Alessandra; Meunier, Lucy; Radenne, Sylvie; Richardet, Jean-Philippe; Vanlemmens, Claire; Hazzan, Marc; Saliba, Faouzi",Clin Res Hepatol Gastroenterol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinre.2021.101639; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210740121000188; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210740121000188?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33636654/,247

Case Report 57-year-old lady developed COVID-19 infection in May 2020. In June 2020, she presented with chest pain, was noted to have STEMI on EKG, complicated by cardiac arrest with ROSC in 14 minutes. She was in cardiogenic shock as well and was started on veno-arterial ECMO. She underwent left anterior descending artery stent placement. Further hospitalization was complicated by persistent cardiogenic shock and complete heart block and underwent pacemaker and cardiac-defibrillator implantation. She developed pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury requiring hemodialysis, shock liver, and persistent cardiogenic shock. She was weaned off VA-ECMO after 4 days but continued to have severely reduced cardiac function. RHC revealed severe volume overload, pulmonary venous hypertension, low cardiac output, and right heart dysfunction. Echo showed severe LV dysfunction with an EF of 15%. A femoral intra-aortic balloon pump(IABP) was placed on July 7, 2020. An attempt was made to wean her off of IABP on July 10th,however, it was unsuccessful and she was transitioned to axillary intra-aortic balloon pump. She remained IABP dependent thereafter and on July 15th, given persistent cardiogenic shock, decision was made to pursue advanced heart failure therapies. After multi-disciplinary discussion, the decision to pursue LVAD implantation was made. She underwent a successful LVAD implantation on July 20th . She failed an extubation trial and underwent tracheostomy on July 23rd . Post LVAD, she developed atrial fibrillation and was started on digoxin and amiodarone. Her symptoms improved and she was subsequently discharged to rehabilitation in late August on amiodarone, digoxin, metoprolol, prasugrel, warfarin, spironolactone and lisinopril. The detailed timeline is shown in figure 1. Summary Hypercoagulability and severe inflammatory stress leading to life-threatening illness is a significant complication of COVID-19 infection. A low threshold for suspecting and treating hypercoagulability and inflammatory induced myocardial ischemia and injury and cardiogenic shock is a reasonable strategy to decrease acute as well as chronic morbidity and mortality.","Rai, D.; Anjum, Z.; Tahir, M.; Pandey, R.; Thakkar, S.; Zaheer, A.; Feitell, S.; Khodjaev, S.; Lee, E.; Parikh, V.",The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053249821021641; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053249821021641,247

Examination of the data showed suspicious patterns that warranted serious review. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to review the methods used to identify and prevent fraudulent survey responses. METHODS: As precautions, we included a Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA), a hidden question, and instructions for respondents to type a specific word. To identify likely fraudulent data, we defined a priori indicators that warranted elimination or suspicion. If a survey contained two or more suspicious indicators, the survey was eliminated. We examined differences between the retained and eliminated data sets. RESULTS: Of the total responses (N=1977), nearly three-fourths (n=1408) were dropped and one-fourth (n=569) were retained after data quality checking. Comparisons of the two data sets showed statistically significant differences across almost all demographic characteristics.

594366,Mitigating the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on controlling vascular risk factors among participants in a carotid stenosis trial,2020-09-30,"A prominent characteristic of the COVID-19 pandemic is the marked geographic variation in COVID-19 prevalence. The objective of the current study is to assess the influence of population density and socio-economic measures (socio-economic ranking and the Gini Index) across cities on coronavirus infection rates. Israel provides an interesting case study based on the highly non-uniform distribution of urban populations, the existence of one of the most densely populated cities in the world and diversified populations. Moreover, COVID19 challenges the consensus regarding compact planning design. Consequently, it is important to analyze the relationship between COVID19 spread and population density. The outcomes of our study show that ceteris paribus projected probabilities to be infected from coronavirus rise with population density from 1.6 to 2.72% up to a maximum of 5.17–5.238% for a population density of 20,282–20,542 persons per square kilometer (sq. km.). Above this benchmark, the anticipated infection rate drops up to 4.06–4.50%. Projected infection rates of 4.06–4.50% are equal in cities, towns and regional councils (Local Authorities) with the maximal population density of 26,510 and 11,979–13,343 persons per sq. km. A possible interpretation is that while denser cities facilitate human interactions, they also enable and promote improved health infrastructure. This, in turn, contributes to medical literacy, namely, elevated awareness to the benefits associated with compliance with hygienic practices (washing hands), social distancing rules and wearing masks. Findings may support compact planning design principles, namely, development of dense, mixed use, walkable and transit accessible community design in compact and polycentric regions. Indeed, city planners should weigh the costs and benefits of many risk factors, including the COVID19 pandemic.","Arbel, Yuval; Fialkoff, Chaim; Kerner, Amichai; Kerner, Miryam",Ann Reg Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483464/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00168-021-01073-y,247

METHODS: The Functional Low-Vision Observer Rated Assessment (FLORA) and Impact of Vision Impairment–Very Low Vision (IVI-VLV) instruments were administered to four subjects before implantation and after device fitting. The FLORA contains 13 self-reported and 35 observer-reported items ranked for ease of conducting task (impossible-easy, central tendency given as mode). The IVI-VLV instrument quantified the impact of low vision on daily activities and emotional well-being. RESULTS: Three subjects completed the FLORA for two years after device fitting; the fourth subject ceased participation in the FLORA after fitting for reasons unrelated to the device. For all subjects at each post-fitting visit, the mode ease of task with device ON was better or equal to device OFF. Ease of task improved over the first six months with device ON, then remained stable. Subjects reported improvements in mobility, functional vision, and quality of life with device ON. The IVI-VLV suggested self-assessed vision-related quality of life was not impacted by device implantation or usage. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects demonstrated sustained improved ease of task scores with device ON compared to OFF, indicating the device has a positive impact in the real-world setting.

We utilised a novel algorithmic strategy to profile exacerbation phenotypes based on underlying aetiologies. METHODS: Patients hospitalised for AECOPD (n=146) were investigated for aetiological contributors summarised in a mnemonic acronym ABCDEFGX (A: airway virus; B: bacterial; C: co-infection; D: depression/anxiety; E: eosinophils; F: failure (cardiac); G: general environment; X: unknown). Results from clinical investigations were combined to construct AECOPD phenotypes. Relationships to clinical outcomes were examined for both composite phenotypes and their specific aetiological components. Aetiologies identified at exacerbation were reassessed at outpatient follow-up. RESULTS: Hospitalised AECOPDs were remarkably diverse, with 26 distinct phenotypes identified. Multiple aetiologies were common (70%) and unidentifiable aetiology rare (4.1%). If viruses were detected (29.5%), patients had longer hospitalisation (7.7±5.6 versus 6.0±3.9 days, p=0.03) despite fewer “frequent exacerbators” (9.3% versus 37%, p=0.001) and lower mortality at 1 year (p=0.03). If bacterial infection was found (40.4%), patients were commonly “frequent exacerbators” (44% versus 18.4%, p=0.001). Eosinophilic exacerbations (28%) were associated with lower pH (7.32±0.06 versus 7.36±0.09, p=0.04), higher venous carbon dioxide tension (P(vCO(2))) (53.7±10.5 versus 48.8±12.8, p=0.04), greater noninvasive ventilation (NIV) usage (34.1% versus 18.1%) but shorter hospitalisation (4 (3–5) versus 6 (4–9) days, p<0.001) and lower infection rates (41.4% versus 80.9%, p<0.0001). Cardiac dysfunction and severe anxiety/depression were common in both infective and non-infective exacerbations. Characteristics identified at exacerbation often persisted after recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalised AECOPDs have numerous causes, often in combination, that converge in complex, multi-faceted phenotypes. Clinically important differences in outcomes suggest that a phenotyping strategy based on aetiologies can enhance AECOPD management.","MacDonald, Martin I.; Osadnik, Christian R.; Bulfin, Lauren; Leahy, Elizabeth; Leong, Paul; Shafuddin, Eskandarain; Hamza, Kais; King, Paul T.; Bardin, Philip G.",ERJ Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34262973/; https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00198-2021,247

N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is the gold standard biomarker for HF diagnosis and therapy monitoring. It is determined in blood samples by the immunochemical methods generally adopted by most laboratories. Saliva analysis is a powerful tool for clinical applications, mainly due to its non-invasive and less risky sampling. This study describes a validated analytical procedure for NT-proBNP determination in saliva samples using a commercial Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay. Linearity, matrix effect, sensitivity, recovery and assay-precision were evaluated. The analytical approach showed a linear behaviour of the signal throughout the concentrations tested, with a minimum detectable dose of 1 pg/mL, a satisfactory NT-proBNP recovery (95–110%), and acceptable precision (coefficient of variation ≤ 10%). Short-term (3 weeks) and long-term (5 months) stability of NT-proBNP in saliva samples under the storage conditions most frequently used in clinical laboratories (4, − 20, and − 80 °C) was also investigated and showed that the optimal storage conditions were at − 20 °C for up to 2.5 months. Finally, the method was tested for the determination of NT-proBNP in saliva samples collected from ten hospitalized acute HF patients. Preliminary results indicate a decrease in NT-proBNP in saliva from admission to discharge, thus suggesting that this procedure is an effective saliva-based point-of-care device for HF monitoring.","Bellagambi, Francesca G.; Petersen, Christina; Salvo, Pietro; Ghimenti, Silvia; Franzini, Maria; Biagini, Denise; Hangouët, Marie; Trivella, Maria Giovanna; Di Francesco, Fabio; Paolicchi, Aldo; Errachid, Abdelhamid; Fuoco, Roger; Lomonaco, Tommaso",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92488-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34158583/,247

As for SARS-CoV that caused the SARS 2003 epidemic, the receptor on host cells that promotes uptake, through attachment of the spike (S) protein of the virus, is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In a recent article published by Batlle et al. (Clin. Sci. (Lond.)

Another way, discussed here, to capture SARS-CoV-2, as an adjunct or alternative, would be to use ACE2(+)-small extracellular vesicles (sEVs).

This study examined nursing students’ experiences caring for cancer patients after receiving drama-combined nursing education for cancer care (DCC), which consisted of three elements: lectures, dramatic scenarios, and debriefing. The lectures dealt with cancer statistics, diseases, and nursing, and the dramatic scenarios depicted both breast cancer patients and lung cancer patients. Sixty-seven junior-year nursing students attended a 90 min DCC session developed by the authors. Focus group interviews were conducted to explore students’ educational experiences, and the following three themes were derived using the thematic analysis method: ‘understanding the lives of patients with severe diseases and their families’, ‘seeing a nursing role model provide patient-centered care’, and ‘projecting an image of oneself as a future nurse’. Using drama in nursing education for cancer patients provided an opportunity for students to imagine the clinical experiences of cancer patients, helping them to understand patients’ points of view and reflect on their self-images as future nurses.

RESULTS: During the 12‐week study period, the overall cytological sample workload decreased by 41.6% in comparison with 2019. In particular, the workload significantly declined for each sample type: Pap smears, –33.3%; urine, –42.8%; serous fluids, –14.4%; thyroid, –54.5%; breast, –43%; lymph node, –27.3%; and salivary gland, –61%. By contrast, the overall malignancy rate was significantly increased (P = .0011). CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in the cytological sample workload during the postlockdown period still represents an ongoing effect of the COVID‐19 pandemic. On the other hand, the rise in the overall malignancy rate reflects the importance of prioritizing diagnostic procedures for patients at high oncological risk.","Vigliar, Elena; Cepurnaite, Rima; Iaccarino, Antonino; Pisapia, Pasquale; De Luca, Caterina; Malapelle, Umberto; Bellevicine, Claudio; Troncone, Giancarlo",Cancer Cytopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33595924/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cncy.22416,247

AIMS: We here analyzed workflow time intervals and functional outcomes of LVO patients treated with endovascular thrombectomy (ET) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. METHODS: We compared the frequency, pre- and intrahospital workflow time intervals, rates of reperfusion, and functional outcome of patients admitted from March 1st to May 31st 2020 with patients admitted during the same time interval in 2019 to 12 university and municipal hospitals across Germany (N = 795). RESULTS: The number of LVO patients treated with ET between March to May 2020 was similar when compared to the same interval in 2019. Direct-to-center patients and patients admitted through interhospital transfer in 2020 showed similar pre- and intrahospital workflow time intervals compared to patients admitted in 2019, except for a longer door-to-groin time in patients admitted through interhospital transfer in 2020 (47 min vs 38 min, p = 0.005). Rates of reperfusion were not significantly different between 2020 and 2019. Functional outcome at discharge of LVO patients treated in 2020 was not significantly different compared to patients treated in 2019. CONCLUSION: Pre- and intrahospital workflows, ET efficacy, and functional outcome of LVO patients treated with ET were not affected during the COVID-19 pandemic in our large cohort from centers across Germany.","Tiedt, Steffen; Bode, Felix J.; Uphaus, Timo; Alegiani, Anna; Gröschel, Klaus; Petzold, Gabor C.",Neurol Res Pract,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42466-020-00090-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33251485/,247

We retrospectively analyzed the Ports evaluation and flushing procedure data between February 3, 2020 and April 3, 2020; the cases were divided into the normal group and delayed group according to the critical point of the maintenance interval of 28 days (4 weeks). We compared the incidence of catheter obstruction between the 2 groups, analyzed the causes of catheter removal events in the 2 groups, and proposed corresponding protective treatment recommendations. During the period, 329 cases were included in the study. There was no significant difference in the incidence of catheter obstruction between the 2 groups. There were 15 patients with catheter removal, 8 cases of infection, 5 cases of catheter obstruction, and 1 case of an ectopic catheter, as well as 1 case of an overturned port. During the epidemic, no hospital infections related to the Ports flushing procedure occurred. The interval of Ports flushing procedures for patients without clinical symptoms can be appropriately extended during the COVID-19 epidemic. However, once the local infection symptoms or other sources of discomfort appear, Ports assessment needs to be performed as soon as possible. Take enhanced protected and isolation measures did not increase cross-infection during outpatient's flushing procedure at non-COVID-19-designated diagnosis and treatment hospitals.","Yan, Weipeng; Zhang, Chaoya; Luo, Chenggang; Li, Zilin",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33607812/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000024720,247

601451,Clinical and Autoimmune Characteristics of Severe and Critical Cases of COVID‐19,2020-05-14,"Limited data exists to date on the predictors for the development of pneumonia in patients with mild and moderate coronavirus (COVID-19). In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the demographic characteristics and clinical findings of mild and moderate COVID-19 and to determine the risk factors for the development of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients admitted to the pandemic outpatient clinic of a university hospital. A total of 414 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were included. Of these, 220 (53.1%) were male, the mean age was 38.3 ± 12.7. Median duration of hospital admission from the onset of symptoms was three days (0-11). Of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, 154 (37.2%) had a history of family contact and the most common symptoms were weakness (68.4%), myalgia (61.8%), headache (56.5%), loss of smell (45.2%), loss of taste (43.2%) and anorexia (42.8%). Among females, weakness (p= 0.016), headache (p= 0.008), sore throat (p= 0.032), nausea (p= 0.003), anorexia (p= 0.045), loss of taste (p= 0.005) and loss of smell (p<0.001) were more common. Loss of taste (47.6% vs. 25%, p<0.001) and loss of smell (50% vs. 26.3%, p<0.001) were more common in patients with under the age of 50 and cough (43.4% vs. 29.3%, p= 0.003) was more common in patients with above the age of 40. Among 46 (11.1%) patients with asymptomatic COVID-19, there was no significant difference (p= 0.500) between the genders. Pneumonia was detected in 150 (43.8%) of 339 patients who underwent thorax computed tomography. In the univariate analysis; advanced age (p<0.001, odds ratio (OR)= 1.44), obesity (p<0.001 OR= 2.5), not being actively smoking (p<0.001, OR= 6.19), fever at first admission (p= 0.002, OR= 2.02), cough (p<0.001, OR= 3.26), shortness of breath (p<0.001, OR= 23.37), weakness (p= 0.042, OR= 1.63), anorexia (p= 0.009, OR= 1.79) and elevation of D-dimer (p= 0.014, OR= 1.92) were associated with the development of pneumonia. In multivariate analysis, obesity (p= 0.005, OR= 2.69), not being actively smoking (p<0.001, OR= 5.43), cough at first admission p= 0.017, OR= 2.16) and shortness of breath (p= 0.008, OR= 16.22) was determined as an independent risk factor for the development of pneumonia. CRP (p<0.001), D-dimer (p<0.001), ferritin (p<0.001) values among 108 (26.1%) patients with a body-mass index(BMI) >30 were high, and 60.9% of the patients had pneumonia (p<0.001) . CRP (p<0.001), D-dimer (p= 0.010) values were low, lymphocyte count (p= 0.001) was high among 106 (25.6%) active smokers, and 15.6% of the patients had pneumonia (p<0.001). Of the patients reported with persistent symptoms, 25.9% had loss of smell, 25% had weakness, and 23.1% had loss of taste on the seventh day; 21.1% had loss of smell, 21.1% had myalgia, and 19.7% had loss of taste on the 14th day. During their follow-up, the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was studied in 286 patients for control purposes. The median time of being negative for COVID-19 PCR test was eight days (3-56). In conclusion, symptoms may last longer than 14 days in 20- 30% of patients presenting with mild-moderate clinical findings.

While state Medicaid programs are currently expanding coverage policies and enrollment to address acute public health needs, states will soon face significant budget shortfalls. These impending changes may renew partisan debates about restrictive policies like work requirements, which generally require beneficiaries to verify their participation in certain activities—such as employment, job search, or training programs—in order to receive or retain coverage. We argue that restrictive Medicaid policies are driven, to a great extent, by political party affiliation, highlighting the outsized role of partisanship in Medicaid policy adoption. To combat these dynamics, additional efforts are needed to improve community-informed decision-making, strengthen evaluation approaches to tie evidence to policymaking, and boost participation in and understanding of the political processes that affect policy change.","Zhu, Jane M.; Grande, David; Jones, David K.; Tipirneni, Renuka",J Gen Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32813219/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-06117-1,247
601776,Cold agglutinin disease after COVID‐19 vaccine,2021-06-27,"BACKGROUND: There are no prior reports that compare differentially methylated regions of DNA in blood samples from COVID-19 patients to samples collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic using a shared epigenotyping platform. We performed a genome-wide analysis of circulating blood DNA CpG methylation using the Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip on 124 blood samples from hospitalized COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients and compared these data with previously reported data from 39 healthy individuals collected before the pandemic. Prospective outcome measures such as COVID-19-GRAM risk-score and mortality were combined with methylation data. RESULTS: Global mean methylation levels did not differ between COVID-19 patients and healthy pre-pandemic controls. About 75% of acute illness-associated differentially methylated regions were located near gene promoter regions and were hypo-methylated in comparison with healthy pre-pandemic controls. Gene ontology analyses revealed terms associated with the immune response to viral infections and leukocyte activation; and disease ontology analyses revealed a predominance of autoimmune disorders. Among COVID-19-positive patients, worse outcomes were associated with a prevailing hyper-methylated status. Recursive feature elimination identified 77 differentially methylated positions predictive of COVID-19 severity measured by the GRAM-risk score. CONCLUSION: Our data contribute to the awareness that DNA methylation may influence the expression of genes that regulate COVID-19 progression and represent a targetable process in that setting.

602018,Clinical features of Chinese children with COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections,2021,"Within a crippling economic context and a rapidly evolving healthcare system, pharmacists in Lebanon are striving to promote their role in primary care. Community pharmacists, although held in high esteem by the population, are not recognised as primary health care providers by concerned authorities. They are perceived as medication sellers. The role of the pharmacist in primary health care networks, established by the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) to serve most vulnerable populations, is limited to medication delivery. The practice of the pharmacy profession in Lebanon has been regulated in 1950 by the Lebanese Pharmacists Association [Order of Pharmacists of Lebanon] (OPL). In 2016, the OPL published its mission, vision, and objectives, aiming to protect the pharmacists’ rights by enforcing rules and procedures, raise the profession’s level through continuous education, and ensure patients’ appropriate access to medications and pharmacist’s counseling for safe medication use. Since then, based on the identified challenges, the OPL has suggested several programs, inspired by the World Health Organization and the International Pharmaceutical Federation guidelines, as part of a strategic plan to develop the pharmacy profession and support patient safety. These programs included the application of principles of good governance, the provision of paid services, developing pharmacists’ core and advanced competencies, generation of accreditation standards for both community pharmacy and pharmacy education, suggesting new laws and decrees, continuing education consolidation and professional development. There was an emphasis on all decisions to be evidence assessment-based. However, OPL faces a major internal political challenge: its governing body, which is reelected every three years, holds absolute powers in changing strategies for the three-year mandate, without program continuation beyond each mandate. Within this context, we recommend the implementation of a strategic plan to integrate pharmacy in primary health centers, promoting the public health aspect of the profession and taking into account of critical health issues and the changing demographics and epidemiological transition of the Lebanese population. Unless the proposed blueprint in this paper is adopted, the profession is unfortunately condemned to disappear in the current political, economic and health-related Lebanese context.","Hallit, Souheil; Selwan, Carla Abou; Salameh., Pascale",Pharm Pract (Granada),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566052/; https://doi.org/10.18549/pharmpract.2020.2.2003,247

In this study we identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike of the prototype IBV strain M41. By analyzing the ability of recombinantly expressed chimeric and truncated spike proteins to bind to chicken tissues, we demonstrate that the N-terminal 253 amino acids of the spike are both required and sufficient for binding to chicken respiratory tract in an α-2,3-sialic acid-dependent manner. Critical amino acids for attachment of M41 spike are present within the N-terminal residues 19–69, which overlap with a hypervariable region in the S1 gene.

This paper describes the processes involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 from the initial infection and subsequent destruction of type II alveolar epithelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 and culminating in the development of ARDS. MAIN BODY: The activation of alveolar cells and alveolar macrophages leads to the release of large quantities of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and their translocation into the pulmonary vasculature. The presence of these inflammatory mediators in the vascular compartment leads to the activation of vascular endothelial cells platelets and neutrophils and the subsequent formation of platelet neutrophil complexes. These complexes in concert with activated endothelial cells interact to create a state of immunothrombosis. The consequence of immunothrombosis include hypercoagulation, accelerating inflammation, fibrin deposition, migration of NET producing neutrophils into the alveolar apace, activation of the NLRP3 inflammazome, increased alveolar macrophage destruction and massive tissue damage by pyroptosis and necroptosis Therapeutic combinations aimed at ameliorating immunothrombosis and preventing the development of severe COVID19 are discussed in detail.","Morris, Gerwyn; Bortolasci, Chiara C.; Puri, Basant K.; Olive, Lisa; Marx, Wolfgang; O'Neil, Adrienne; Athan, Eugene; Carvalho, Andre; Maes, Michael; Walder, Ken; Berk, Michael",Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33096114/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118617; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320520313709; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520313709?v=s5,247
602776,"Testing the association between blood type and COVID-19 infection, intubation, and death",2020-04-11,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) is a highly infectious viral syndrome currently threatening millions of people worldwide. It is widely recognized as a disease of the pulmonary system, presenting with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, a number of extrapulmonary manifestations have been described in the literature. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive summary of the hematologic, gastroenterological, renal, dermatologic, neurologic, and psychiatric manifestations of COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Hematological presentations of COVID-19 include laboratory abnormalities such as decreased total lymphocyte count, prolonged prothrombin time (PT), elevated d-dimer, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Several of these findings are associated with increased mortality among infected patients. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Furthermore, presence of viral RNA in patient stool suggests the possibility of additional testing modalities for COVID-19. Nephrological findings such as proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated BUN and creatinine levels have been observed. Additionally, several studies demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 who developed acute kidney injury (AKI) had a greater risk of mortality. The virus can also present with cutaneous symptoms such as erythematous rashes, urticaria, and chicken pox-like lesions. Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been described in the literature, and patients can exhibit findings consistent with viral encephalitis, cerebral vascular disease, peripheral nerve disorders, and psychosis. CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 does usually present primarily with respiratory symptoms, the extra-pulmonary manifestations of the virus are unpredictable and varied. Better understanding and awareness of these symptoms can lead to more efficient diagnosis, rapid treatment, isolation, and decreased spread of the disease.","AlSamman, Marya; Caggiula, Amy; Ganguli, Sangrag; Misak, Monika; Ali Pourmand",Am J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33039218/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.09.054; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720308470?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720308470,247

Central nervous system inflammation, the presumed mechanism of influenza-associated encephalopathy, is difficult to detect. Characteristics of children presenting with severe neurological complications of influenza, and potential biomarkers of influenza-associated encephalopathy are described. METHODS: A multi-center, retrospective case-series of children with influenza and neurological complications during 2017 was performed. Enrolled cases met criteria for influenza-associated encephalopathy or had status epilepticus. Functional outcome at discharge was compared between groups using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS: There were 22 children with influenza studied of whom 11/22 had encephalopathy and 11/22 had status epilepticus. Only one child had a documented influenza immunization. The biomarker CSF neopterin was tested in 10/11 children with encephalopathy and was elevated in 8/10. MRI was performed in all children with encephalopathy and was abnormal in 8 (73%). Treatment of children with encephalopathy was with corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin in 9/11 (82%). In all cases oseltamivir use was low (59%) while admission to the intensive care unit was frequent (14/22, 66%). Clinical outcome at discharge was moderate to severe disability (mRS score > 2) in the majority of children with encephalopathy (7/11, 64%), including one child who died. Children with status epilepticus recovered to near-baseline function in all cases. CONCLUSION: Raised CSF neopterin was present in most cases of encephalopathy, and along with diffusion restriction on MRI, is a useful diagnostic biomarker. Lack of seasonal influenza vaccination represents a missed opportunity to prevent illness in children, including severe neurological disease.","Macdonald-Laurs, Emma; Koirala, Archana; Britton, Philip N.; Rawlinson, William; Hiew, Chee Chung; Mcrae, Jocelynne; Dale, Russell C.; Jones, Cheryl; Macartney, Kristine; McMullan, Brendan; Pillai, Sekhar",Eur J Paediatr Neurol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090379818302034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30316638/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090379818302034; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpn.2018.09.009,247
603597,Reply to: “Parkinson's Disease and COVID‐19: Do We Need to Be More Patient?”,2021-02-18,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted frail older adults, especially residents of long-term care (LTC) facilities. This has appropriately led to prioritization of frail older adults and LTC residents, and those who care for them, in the vaccination effort against COVID-19. Older adults have distinct immunological, clinical, and practical complexity, which can be understood through a lens of frailty. Even so, frailty has not been considered in studies of COVID-19 vaccines to date, leading to concerns that the vaccines have not been optimally tailored for and evaluated in this population even as vaccination programs are being implemented. This is an example of how vaccines are often not tested in Phase 1/2/3 clinical trials in the people most in need of protection. We argue that geriatricians, as frailty specialists, have much to contribute to the development, testing and implementation of COVID-19 vaccines in older adults. We discuss roles for geriatricians in ten stages of the vaccine development process, covering vaccine design, trial design, trial recruitment, establishment and interpretation of illness definitions, safety monitoring, consideration of relevant health measures such as frailty and function, analysis methods to account for frailty and differential vulnerability, contributions in regulatory and advisory roles, post-marketing surveillance, and program implementation and public health messaging. In presenting key recommendations pertinent to each stage, we hope to contribute to a dialogue on how to push the field of vaccinology to embrace the complexity of frailty. Making vaccines that can benefit frail older adults will benefit everyone in the fight against COVID-19.","Andrew, Melissa K; Schmader, Kenneth E; Rockwood, Kenneth; Clarke, Barry; McElhaney, Janet E",Clin Interv Aging,https://doi.org/10.2147/cia.s295522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33953551/,247

We describe COVID-19 infection control measures implemented and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in the Emory Dialysis facilities. METHODS: Implementation of COVID-19 infection procedures commenced in February 2020. Subsequently, COVID-19 preparedness assessments were conducted at each facility. Patients with COVID-19 from March 1–May 31, 2020 were included; with a follow-up period spanning March–June 30, 2020. Percentages of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were calculated, and characteristics of COVID-19 patients were summarized as medians or percentage. Baseline characteristics of all patients receiving care at Emory Dialysis (i.e. Emory general dialysis population) were presented as medians and percentages. RESULTS: Of 751 dialysis patients, 23 (3.1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The median age was 67.0 years and 13 patients (56.6%) were female. Eleven patients (47.8%) were residents of nursing homes. Nineteen patients (82.6%) required hospitalization and 6 patients (26.1%) died; the average number of days from a positive SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) test to death was 16.8 days (range 1–34). Two patients dialyzing at adjacent dialysis stations and a dialysis staff who cared for them, were diagnosed with COVID-19 in a time frame that may suggest transmission in the dialysis facility. In response, universal masking in the facility was implemented (prior to national guidelines recommending universal masking), infection control audits and re-trainings of PPE were also done to bolster infection control practices. CONCLUSION: We successfully implemented recommended COVID-19 infection control measures aimed at mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the patients with COVID-19 required hospitalizations. Dialysis facilities should remain vigilant and monitor for possible transmission of COVID-19 in the facility.","Apata, Ibironke W.; Cobb, Jason; Navarrete, Jose; Burkart, John; Plantinga, Laura; Lea, Janice P.",BMC Nephrol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-021-02281-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33676397/,247

Such a comprehensive scoping is needed, however, to offer direction to policy, programming and future research. We aim to undertake a scoping review of studies on ASRH in SSA to capture the landscape of extant research and findings and identify gaps for future research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol is designed using the framework for scoping reviews developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. We will include English and French language peer-reviewed publications and grey literature on ASRH (aged 10-19) in SSA published between January 2010 and June 2019. A three-step search strategy involving an initial search of three databases to refine the keywords, a full search of all databases and screening of references of previous review studies for relevant articles missing from our full search will be employed. We will search AJOL, JSTOR, HINARI, Scopus, Science Direct, Google Scholar and the websites for the WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNESCO and Guttmacher Institute. Two reviewers will screen the titles, abstracts and full texts of publications for eligibility and inclusion-using Covidence (an online software). We will then extract relevant information from studies that meet the inclusion criteria using a tailored extraction frame and template. Extracted data will be analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results will be presented using tables and charts and summaries of key themes arising from available research findings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for a scoping review as it synthesises publicly available publications. Dissemination will be through publication in a peer-review journal and presentation at relevant conferences and convening of policymakers and civil society organisations working on ASRH in SSA.","Ajayi, Anthony Idowu; Ushie, Boniface Ayanbekongshie; Mwoka, Meggie; Igonya, Emmy Kageha; Ouedraogo, Ramatou; Juma, Kenneth; Aboderin, Isabella",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32611738/,247
604523,"Inhaled Edoxaban dry powder inhaler formulations: Development, characterization and their effects on the coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 infection",2021-10-25,"Critical illness-associated weakness (CIAW) is an umbrella term used to describe a group of neuromuscular disorders caused by severe illness. It can be subdivided into three major classifications based on the component of the neuromuscular system (i.e. peripheral nerves or skeletal muscle or both) that are affected. This includes critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), critical illness myopathy (CIM), and an overlap syndrome, critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM). It is a common complication observed in people with critical illness requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Given CIAW is found in individuals experiencing grave illness, it can be challenging to study from a practical standpoint. However, over the past 2 decades, many insights into the pathophysiology of this condition have been made. Results from studies in both humans and animal models have found that a profound systemic inflammatory response and factors related to bioenergetic failure as well as microvascular, metabolic, and electrophysiological alterations underlie the development of CIAW. Current management strategies focus on early mobilization, achieving euglycemia, and nutritional optimization. Other interventions lack sufficient evidence, mainly due to a dearth of large trials. The goal of this Physiology in Medicine article is to highlight important aspects of the pathophysiology of these enigmatic conditions. It is hoped that improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying these disorders will lead to further study and new investigations for novel pharmacologic, nutritional, and exercise-based interventions to optimize patient outcomes.","Cheung, Kevin; Rathbone, Alasdair; Melanson, Michel; Trier, Jessica; Ritsma, Benjamin R.; Allen, Matti D.",J Appl Physiol (1985),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734888/; https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00019.2021,247

This also influences the psychological treatment options of patients with headache. AIM: The present article intends to illustrate the different psychological forms of treatment for headache patients and their implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Literature review and case reports. RESULTS: Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, psychological treatment enables the increased stress level in headache patients to be counteracted by using cognitive behavioral therapy and relaxation techniques. The changed living conditions are often unfavorable but sometimes also favorable in the course of disease. It can be shown that even during the pandemic, such favorable changes can be used to support patients to cope with their headache. CONCLUSION: The digital implementation of psychological approaches makes a major contribution to maintaining psychological treatment of headache patients, so that the individually changed needs can be addressed. With respect to content, stress regulation techniques and increased acceptance gain in importance. Regarding biofeedback there are limitations, which may be overcome by improved technical devices.","Dresler, T.; Guth, A.-L.; Lüpke, J.; Kropp, P.",Schmerz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33030591/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00482-020-00507-4,247
604725,Iatrogenic anaemia and transfusion thresholds in ICU patients with COVID-19 disease at a tertiary care hospital,2021-01-22,"Respiratory viral infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world; however, there are several groups of viruses that are insufficiently routinely sought for, and can thus be considered neglected from a diagnostic and clinical standpoint. Timely detection of seasonality of certain respiratory viruses (e.g., enveloped viruses such as seasonal coronaviruses) in the local context can aid substantially in targeted and cost-effective utilization of viral diagnostic approaches. For the other, non-enveloped and year-round viruses (i.e., rhinovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus), a continuous virological diagnosis needs to be implemented in clinical laboratories to more effectively address the aetiology of respiratory infections, and assess the overall impact of these viruses on disease burden. While the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still actively unfolding, we aimed to emphasize the persistent role of seasonal coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and bocaviruses in the aetiology of respiratory infections. Consequently, this paper concentrates on the burden and epidemiological trends of aforementioned viral groups on a global level, but also provides a snapshot of their prevalence patterns in Croatia in order to underscore the potential implications of viral seasonality. An overall global prevalence in respiratory tract infections was found to be between 0.5 and 18.4% for seasonal coronaviruses, between 13 and 59% for rhinoviruses, between 1 and 36% for human adenoviruses, and between 1 and 56.8% for human bocaviruses. A Croatian dataset on patients with respiratory tract infection and younger than 18 years of age has revealed a fairly high prevalence of rhinoviruses (33.4%), with much lower prevalence of adenoviruses (15.6%), seasonal coronaviruses (7.1%), and bocaviruses (5.3%). These insights represent a relevant discussion point in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where the testing of non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses has been limited in many settings, making the monitoring of disease burden associated with other respiratory viruses rather difficult.","Ljubin-Sternak, Sunčanica; Meštrović, Tomislav; Lukšić, Ivana; Mijač, Maja; Vraneš, Jasmina",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.691163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34291031/,247

We conducted an online survey of urban and rural residents in Henan Province. A total of 517 valid questionnaires were collected via the online platform. The mean scores for knowledge and practice were 5.57/9 and 2.04/3, respectively. More than 90% of the participants believed COVID-19 was serious and preventable, were concerned about the disease process, and actively engaged in learning related knowledge. Our results showed that the COVID-19 knowledge level was significantly different among groups with different ages, genders, education levels and marital statuses; COVID-19 practice was significantly different among different regions. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that education level, female sex, unmarried status, and health care worker status had a significant impact on COVID-19 knowledge; urban area was associated with a higher practice score; COVID-19 knowledge was significantly associated with residents’ attitude toward preventive measures that can prevent COVID-19 infection; urban area was significantly related to the willingness to go to a fever clinic to check for suspected infection. We found that Chinese urban and rural residents held a moderate level of COVID-19 knowledge and practice and showed a positive attitude toward the disease. It is necessary to develop relevant education programs targeting the general population in China to improve COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes and practices, particularly for rural and undereducated residents.","Yue, Shaoting; Zhang, Jun; Cao, Mi; Chen, Bowen",J Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00877-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32757087/,247

The arguments in favour of such investment have been largely based on estimates of the losses in national incomes that might occur as the result of a major epidemic or pandemic. Recently, we extended the estimate to include the valuation of the lives lost as a result of pandemic-related increases in mortality. This produced markedly higher estimates of the full value of loss that might occur as the result of a future pandemic. We parametrized an exceedance probability function for a global influenza pandemic and estimated that the expected number of influenza-pandemic-related deaths is about 720 000 per year. We calculated that the expected annual losses from pandemic risk to be about 500 billion United States dollars – or 0.6% of global income – per year. This estimate falls within – but towards the lower end of – the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s estimates of the value of the losses from global warming, which range from 0.2% to 2% of global income. The estimated percentage of annual national income represented by the expected value of losses varied by country income grouping: from a little over 0.3% in high-income countries to 1.6% in lower-middle-income countries.

A range of material has been drawn upon to highlight educational issues of this learning context, including psychosocial and emotional repercussions. Globally, while some countries opted for a mass school shut-down, many schools remained open for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. This partial closure not only enabled learning in smaller targeted groups but also offered a safe sanctuary for those who needed a regulated and secure environment. In Australia, if full school closures were to be enforced over a long period, a significant proportion of students from more vulnerable backgrounds would likely experience persistent disadvantage through a range of barriers: long-term educational disengagement, digital exclusion, poor technology management, and increased psychosocial challenges.

606419,Immune Thrombocytopenia in a Patient Recovering From COVID-19,2020-09-30,"The extant literature confirms that an array of polymorphic genes related to- neurotransmitters and second messengers govern the net release of dopamine in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) in the mesolimbic region of the brain. They are linked predominantly to motivation, anti-stress, incentive salience (wanting), and wellbeing. Notably, in 2000 the Nobel Prize was awarded to Carlsson, Greengard, and Kandel for their work on the molecular and cellular function of dopaminergic activity at neurons. This historical psychopharmacological work involved neurotransmission of serotonin, endorphins, glutamate, and dopamine, and the seminal work of Blum, Gold, Volkow, Nestler, and others related to neurotransmitter function and related behaviors. Currently, Americans are facing their second and worst opioid epidemic, prescribed opioids, and easy access drive this epidemic of overdoses, and opioid use disorders (OUDs). Presently the clinical consensus is to treat OUD, as if it were an opioid deficiency syndrome, with long-term to life-long opioid substitution therapy. Opioid agonist administration is seen as necessary to replace missing opioids, treat OUD, and prevent overdoses, like insulin is used to treat diabetes. Treatment of OUD and addiction, in general, is similar to the endocrinopathy conceptualization in that it views opioid agonist MATs as an essential core to therapy. Is this approach logical? Other than as harm reduction, is using opioids to treat OUD therapeutic or harmful in the long term? This historical Trieste provides a molecular framework to understand the current underpinnings of endorphinergic/dopaminergic mechanisms related to opioid deficiency syndrome and generalized reward processing depletion.

The Veneto Oncology Network ROV licensed dedicated guidelines to ensure proper care minimizing the risk of infection in cancer patient. ROVID is a regional registry aimed at describing epidemiology and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with cancer diagnosis and documented SARS-CoV-2 infection are eligible. Data on cancer diagnosis, comorbidities, anticancer treatments as well as details on SARS-CoV-infection (hospitalization, treatments, fate of the infection) have been recorded. Logistic regression analysis was applied to calculate the association between clinical/laboratory variables and death from any cause. RESULTS: 170 patients have been enrolled. Median age at time of the SARS-CoV-infection was 70 years (25-92). The most common cancer type was breast cancer (n=40). The majority of the patients had stage IV disease. Half of the patients had 2 or more comorbidities. The majority of the patients (78%) presented with COVID-19 symptoms. More than 77% of the patients were hospitalized, and 6% were admitted to intensive care units. Overall, 104 patients have documented resolution of the infection. Fifty-seven patients (33%) have died. In 29 cases (17%) the cause of death was directly correlated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Factors significantly correlated with the risk of death were: ECOG PS, age, presence of 2 or more comorbidities, presence of dyspnea, COVID-19 phenotype >=3, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, neutrophils/lymphocytes ratio and thrombocytopenia.

With medical institutions closed and switch to online teaching and telehealth, many aspects of medical learning are still compromised, including core clinical rotations, clinical skills evaluation, and exams cancelation. The medical students are distressed about their continuity of education and developing the necessary skill to feel confident enough to practice in the future. The involvement of medical students as frontline workers with inadequate clinical training, the uncertainty of future, lack of knowledge, and access to personal protective equipment have aroused a sense of fear in them. They not only nurture their clinical skills from the clinical rotations but it also helps adapt to their residency program later. With the lack of clinical experience, challenges of online learning, cancelation of conferences, and on-site research, medical students are struggling to make their residency application competitive. Recruiting residents amid the pandemic is a difficult task. The uncertainty in the unprecedented situation has an immense psychological impact on medical students and residency applicants. Despite the hurdles being faced, there are many ways where medical students and residency applicants can use their knowledge to help in fighting the pandemic. They can volunteer in the field of research on COVID-19, as a contact tracer, and provide peer support to the patients through telecommunications.

Infected cattle in general and calves in particular have also been demonstrated as major contributors of zoonotic C. parvum oocysts in the environment and have been linked to a number of waterborne outbreaks of human cryptosporidiosis. Little is known on the occurrence, geographical distribution, and molecular diversity of Cryptosporidium infections affecting bovine populations in Algeria. In this study faecal specimens were randomly collected from 460 cattle aged between two days and 18 months on 10 farms located in the provinces of Aïn Defla, Blida, Sétif, and Tizi Ouzou between the autumn of 2015 and the spring of 2016. Faecal samples were microscopically examined using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast technique as screening method. Microscopy-positive samples were confirmed by a commercial coproantigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Bio-X Diagnostics). The identification of Cryptosporidium species and sub-genotypes in confirmed samples was conducted by PCR and sequence analyses of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssu rRNA) and the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) genes of the parasite. Overall, 52.2% (240/460) of the investigated cattle tested positive to Cryptosporidium by microscopy. The infection was widespread in all 10 farms surveyed, but was significantly more prevalent in those from Blida in the central part of the country. Bovine cryptosporidiosis affected cattle of all age groups but with different outcomes. Pre-weaned (up to one month old) calves typically presented with diarrhoea, whereas older animals mostly harboured sub-clinical infections. The commercial ELISA used only detected 15.8% (38/240) of the samples that previously tested positive by microscopy, demonstrating a poor performance in field epidemiological surveys. Sequence analysis of the 29 isolates generated at the ssu rRNA loci confirmed the presence of four Cryptosporidium species including C. parvum (72.4%), C. bovis (13.8%), C. andersoni, (3.4%), and C. ryanae (3.4%). Two additional isolates (7.0%) could only be identified at the genus level. Eight out of the 21 isolates assigned to C. parvum were identified as sub-genotype IIaA16G2R1 at the gp60 locus. C. parvum was almost exclusively found infecting pre-weaned calves, whereas C. ryanae and C. andersoni were only detected in asymptomatic animals.

In symptomatic patients, fever, cough and dyspnea were observed in 62.6%, 48.8 % and 41.8% of the patients, respectively. Sixty nine (20%) patients had mild SARS-Cov-2 disease, whereas moderate, severe and critical diseases were reported in 101 (29%), 71 (20%) and 55 (16%) patients, respectively. Two hundered fifty one (73.8%) patients were hospitalized for SARS-Cov2. Mortality related to SARS-CoV-2 infection was 26.5% in all cohort; 4.4% in those patients with mild disease, 12.4% in moderate disease and 83% in severe and critical disease. Active hematological disease, lower life expectancy related with primary hematological disease, neutropenia at diagnosis of SARS- CoV-2, ICU admission and first-line therapy used for COVID 19 treatment were found to be related to higher mortality rates. Treatments with hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azitromycin were associated with a higher rate of mortality in comparison with favipiravir use.In conclusion, patients with hematological malignancy infected with SARS-CoV-2 have an increased risk of severe disease and mortality.","Çivriz Bozdağ, Sinem; Cengiz Seval, Güldane; Yonal-Hindilerden, İpek; Hindilerden, Fehmi; Andıç, Neslihan; Baydar, Mustafa; Aydın Kaynar, Lale; Toprak, Selami; Göksoy, Hasan; Balık, Berrin; Demirci, Ufuk; Can, Ferda; Özkocaman, Vildan; Gündüz, Eren; Güven, Tuğba Zeynep; Özkurt, Zübeyde Nur; Demircioğlu, Sinan; Beksaç, Meral; İnce, İdris; Yılmaz, Umut; Eroğlu Küçükdiler, Hilal; Abishov, Elgün; Yavuz, Boran; Ataş, Ünal; Mutlu, Yaşa Gül; Bas, Volkan; Üsküdar Teke, Hava; Gürsoy, Vildan; Çelik, Serhat; Çiftçiler, Rafiye; Yagcı, Münci; Topçuoğlu, Pervin; Çeneli, Özcan; Abbasov, Hamza; Selim, Cem; Ar, Muhlis Cem; Yüce, Kemal Orhan; Sadri, Sevil; Albayrak, Canan; Güler, Nil; Keklik, Muzaffer; Terzi, Hatice; Doğan, Ali; Yegin, Arzu Zeynep; Kurt Yüksel, Meltem; Sogol, Sadri; Yavaşoğlu, İrfan; Beköz, Hüseyin; Aksu, Tekin; Maral, Senem; Erol, Veysel; Kaynar, Leylagül; İlhan, Osman; Bolaman, Ali Zahit; Sevindik, Gökmen Ömür; Akyay, Arzu; Özcan, Muhit; Gürman, Günhan; Ünal, Şule; Yavuz, Yasemin; Diz Küçükkaya, Reyhan; Özsan, Güner Hayri",Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34521187/; https://doi.org/10.4274/tjh.galenos.2021.2021.0287,247

The overall objective of the iCARE Study is to assess public awareness, attitudes, concerns and behavioural responses to COVID-19 public health policies, and their impacts, on people around the world and to link behavioural survey data with policy, mobility and case data to provide behavioural science, data-driven recommendations to governments on how to optimise current policy strategies to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The iCARE study (www.icarestudy.com) uses a multiple cross-sectional survey design to capture self-reported information on a variety of COVID-19 related variables from individuals around the globe. Survey data are captured using two data capture methods: convenience and representative sampling. These data are then linked to open access data for policies, cases and population movement. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The primary ethical approval was obtained from the coordinating site, the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux du Nord-de-l’Île-de-Montréal (REB#: 2020–2099/03–25–2020). This study will provide high-quality, accelerated and real-time evidence to help us understand the effectiveness of evolving country-level policies and communication strategies to reduce the spread of the COVID-19. Due to the urgency of the pandemic, results will be disseminated in a variety of ways, including policy briefs, social media posts, press releases and through regular scientific methods.","Bacon, Simon L; Lavoie, Kim L; Boyle, Jacqueline; Stojanovic, Jovana; Joyal-Desmarais, Keven",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33707274/,247

Improved vaccine candidates for elderly adults are thus urgently needed. For scientific and regulatory requirements, such new vaccines must first be evaluated at the preclinical level, and there is a continuing quest for the ideal animal model with which to perform such studies. The main advantages and limitations of murine models, those most commonly used for human vaccine research, and of large animal models are reviewed and discussed.","Boudet, F.",J Comp Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2009.10.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021997509003296; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021997509003296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19897204/,247
610298,Prolonged Course of COVID-19-Associated Pneumonia in a B-Cell Depleted Patient After Rituximab,2020-09-02,"Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing protein (NLRP) inflammasomes are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of many diseases and disorders. Among NLRPs, the NLRP3 (in humans encoded by the NLRP3 gene) is expressed predominantly in macrophages as a component of the inflammasome and is associated with many diseases, including gout, type 2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, and neurological diseases and disorders. Diterpenes containing repeated isoprenoid units in their structure are a member of some essential oils that possess diverse biological activities and are becoming a landmark in the field of drug discovery and development. This review sketches a current scenario of diterpenes or their derivatives acting through NLRPs, especially NLRP3-associated pathways with anti-inflammatory effects. For this, a literature survey on the subject has been undertaken using a number of known databases with specific keywords. Findings from the aforementioned databases suggest that diterpenes and their derivatives can exert anti-inflammatory effects via NLRPs-related pathways. Andrographolide, triptolide, kaurenoic acid, carnosic acid, oridonin, teuvincenone F, and some derivatives of tanshinone IIA and phorbol have been found to act through NLRP3 inflammasome pathways. In conclusion, diterpenes and their derivatives could be one of the promising compounds for the treatment of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory diseases and disorders.","Islam, Muhammad Torequl; Bardaweel, Sanaa K.; Mubarak, Mohammad S.; Koch, Wojciech; Gaweł-Beben, Katarzyna; Antosiewicz, Beata; Sharifi-Rad, Javad",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.572136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33101293/,247

Currently, there are no approved vaccines or antivirals to mitigate alphavirus infections. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of alphavirus-induced structures and their functions in infected cells. Throughout their lifecycle, alphaviruses induce several structural modifications, including replication spherules, type I and type II cytopathic vacuoles, and filopodial extensions. Type I cytopathic vacuoles are replication-induced structures containing replication spherules that are sites of RNA replication on the endosomal and lysosomal limiting membrane. Type II cytopathic vacuoles are assembly induced structures that originate from the Golgi apparatus. Filopodial extensions are induced at the plasma membrane and are involved in budding and cell-to-cell transport of virions. This review provides an overview of the viral and host factors involved in the biogenesis and function of these virus-induced structures. Understanding virus–host interactions in infected cells will lead to the identification of new targets for antiviral discovery.","Elmasri, Zeinab; Nasal, Benjamin L.; Jose, Joyce",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34451448/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10080984,247

Type I interferon receptor-deficient mice show enhanced anemia, which suggests a protective effect of these cytokines, partly through the control of type II interferon production. The development of anemia requires the expression of Fcγ receptors (FcγR) I, III, and IV. Whereas LDV infection decreases FcγR III expression, it enhances FcγR I and IV expression in wild-type animals. The LDV-associated increase in the expression of FcγR I and IV is largely reduced in type I interferon receptor-deficient mice, through both type II interferon-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Thus, the regulation of the expression of FcγR I and IV, but not III, by interferons may partly explain the exacerbating effect of LDV infection on anemia that results from the enhanced phagocytosis of IgG autoantibody-opsonized erythrocytes.","Legrain, Sarah; Su, Dan; Gaignage, Mélanie; Breukel, Cor; Claassens, Jill; Brouwers, Conny; Linssen, Margot M.; Izui, Shozo; Verbeek, J.

Owing to the fact that a number of significant waterborne virus strains are not readily culturable in vitro at this time (e.g. norovirus, hepatitis A), the susceptibility of these viruses to disinfection is largely unknown. An in-depth understanding of the mechanisms involved in virus inactivation would aid in predicting the susceptibility of non-culturable virus strains to disinfection and would foster the development of improved disinfection methods. Recent technological advances in virology research have provided a wealth of information on enteric virus compositions, structures, and biological functions.

611755,Drugs that Might Be Possibly Used for Treatment of COVID-19 Patients,2021-08-21,"Infectious diarrhea is an important cause of neonatal calf morbidity and mortality that results in significant economic losses in the beef and dairy industries. Although numerous risk factors related to the occurrence of neonatal diarrhea have been identified, they can all be categorized into those that are related to the calf, the pathogens involved, or the environment of the calf. The immune status of calves, specifically the level of passively acquired immunity through colostrum, is the major risk factor related to the calf and the occurrence of diarrhea. Although numerous pathogens have been implicated in the occurrence of neonatal diarrhea, only a relatively limited number are commonly involved. Most should be viewed as secondary opportunists rather than primary pathogens, because none are extraordinarily virulent, and with the exception of Salmonella spp., most are present within the gastrointestinal tract of many healthy, mature cattle. Important risk factors related to pathogens involved in neonatal calf diarrhea involve the size of the inoculum and the occurrence of multiple infections. Finally, when considering the environment and housing conditions in which beef and dairy calves may reside, it is clear that tremendous variations exist. Despite these variations, the risk factors associated with the environment of the calf are also those that are the most amenable to the implementation of general environmental control and monitoring strategies as well as specific biosecurity measures.","Barrington, George M.; Gay, John M.; Evermann, James F.",Vet Clin North Am Food Anim Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12064170/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749072002000051; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749072002000051,247

Methods Prospective observational cohort study on patients hospitalised with COVID-19 disease in February-24th/May-17th 2020 in Milan, Italy. Uni-multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed. Death’s percentage by two-weeks’ intervals according to age and disease severity was analysed. Results A total of 174/539 (32.3%) patients died in hospital over 8,228 person-day follow-up; the 14-day Kaplan-Meier probability of death was 29.5% (95%CI: 25.5-34.0). Older age, burden of comorbidities, COVID-19 disease severity, inflammatory markers at admission were independent predictors of increased risk, while several drug-combinations were predictors of reduced risk of in-hospital death. The highest fatality rate, 36.5%, occurred during the 2nd-3rd week of March, when 55.4% of patients presented with severe disease, while a second peak, by the end of April, was related to the admission of older patients (55% > = 80 years) with less severe disease, 30% coming from long-term care facilities. Conclusions The unusual fatality rate in our setting is likely to be related to age and the clinical conditions of our patients.

612476,Reactive arthritis after COVID-19 infection,2020-08-06,"RATIONALE: Asthma is associated with chronic changes in the airway epithelium, a key target of SARS-CoV-2. Many epithelial changes are driven by the type 2 cytokine IL-13, but the effects of IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown. OBJECTIVES: We sought to discover how IL-13 and other cytokines affect expression of genes encoding SARS-CoV-2-associated host proteins in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and determine whether IL-13 stimulation alters susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We used bulk and single cell RNA-seq to identify cytokine-induced changes in SARS-CoV-2-associated gene expression in HBECs. We related these to gene expression changes in airway epithelium from individuals with mild-moderate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We analyzed effects of IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 infection of HBECs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Transcripts encoding 332 of 342 (97%) SARS-CoV-2-associated proteins were detected in HBECs (≥1 RPM in 50% samples). 41 (12%) of these mRNAs were regulated by IL-13 (>1.5-fold change, FDR < 0.05). Many IL-13-regulated SARS-CoV-2-associated genes were also altered in type 2 high asthma and COPD. IL-13 pretreatment reduced viral RNA recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and decreased dsRNA, a marker of viral replication, to below the limit of detection in our assay. Mucus also inhibited viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: IL-13 markedly reduces susceptibility of HBECs to SARS-CoV-2 infection through mechanisms that likely differ from those activated by type I interferons. Our findings may help explain reports of relatively low prevalence of asthma in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and could lead to new strategies for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bonser, Luke R.; Eckalbar, Walter L.; Rodriguez, Lauren; Shen, Jiangshan; Koh, Kyung Duk; Zlock, Lorna T.; Christenson, Stephanie; Woodruff, Prescott G.; Finkbeiner, Walter E.; Erle, David J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.25.432762; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33655249/,247

In addition, the relationship between stress biomarkers, symptoms and outcome measures of youth using the platform will be investigated in this study. METHODS: The MOST+ platform will be adapted, translated and developed for the situation in the Netherlands in collaboration with a Youth Panel. A prospective cohort of 125 young people (16–25 years) with beginning mental health complaints will be on the platform and followed for a year, of which 10 participants will have an additional smart watch and 10 participants will be asked to provide feedback about the platform. Data will be collected at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months. Outcome measures are Psychological Distress assessed with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Social and occupational functioning (measures by the SOFAS), positive mental health indicators measured by the Positive Health Instrument, stress biomarkers with a smart-watch, website journeys of visitors, and feedback of youth about the platform.

Although COVID-19 vaccines are showing promising results, they are not 100% effective and resistant mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains are on the rise. To successfully fight against SARS-CoV-2 and prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks, it is essential to understand SARS-CoV-2 protein functions, their host interactions, and how these processes convey pathogenicity at host tissue, organ and systemic levels. In vitro models are valuable but lack the physiological context of a whole organism. Current animal models for SARS-CoV-2 research are exclusively mammals, with the intrinsic limitations of long reproduction times, few progeny, ethical concerns and high maintenance costs. These limitations make them unsuitable for rapid functional investigations of virus proteins as well as genetic and pharmacological screens. Remarkably, 90% of the SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interacting proteins are conserved between Drosophila and humans. As a well-established model system for studying human diseases, the fruit fly offers a highly complementary alternative to current mammalian models for SARS-CoV-2 research, from investigating virus protein function to developing targeted drugs. Herein, we review Drosophila’s track record in studying human viruses and discuss the advantages and limitations of using fruit flies for SARS-CoV-2 research. We also review studies that already used Drosophila to investigate SARS-CoV-2 protein pathogenicity and their damaging effects in COVID-19 relevant tissues, as well as studies in which the fly was used as an efficient whole animal drug testing platform for targeted therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 proteins or their host interacting pathways.","van de Leemput, Joyce; Han, Zhe",Cell Biosci,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13578-021-00621-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120640/,247

614389,20-Week Study of Clinical Outcomes of Over-the-Counter COVID-19 Prophylaxis and Treatment,2021-07-06,"OBJECTIVE: Studies have shown that fidgeting augments metabolic demand and increases blood flow to the moving limbs, whereas prolonged sitting suppresses these factors and exacerbates postprandial glucose excursions. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study was that leg fidgeting during prolonged sitting would improve postprandial glycemic control. METHODS: Adults with obesity (n = 20) participated in a randomized crossover trial in which blood glucose and insulin concentrations were measured during a 3-hour sitting period following the ingestion of a glucose load (75 g). During sitting, participants either remained stationary or intermittently fidgeted both legs (2.5 minutes off and 2.5 minutes on). Accelerometer counts, oxygen consumption, and popliteal-artery blood flow were also measured during the sitting period. RESULTS: As expected, fidgeting increased accelerometer counts (P < 0.01), oxygen consumption (P < 0.01), and blood flow through the popliteal artery (P < 0.05). Notably, fidgeting lowered both glucose (P < 0.01) and insulin (P < 0.05) total area under the curve (AUC) and glucose incremental AUC (P < 0.05). Additionally, there was a strong negative correlation between fidgeting-induced increases in blood flow and reduced postprandial glucose AUC within the first hour (r = -0.569, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Leg fidgeting is a simple, light-intensity physical activity that enhances limb blood flow and can be incorporated during prolonged sitting to improve postprandial glycemic control in people with obesity.","Pettit-Mee, Ryan J; Ready, Sean T; Padilla, Jaume; Kanaley, Jill A",Obesity (Silver Spring),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34159757/; https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23173,247

The involvement of medical students, residents and fellows in COVID‐19 care has and continues to vary by specialty and regions across the country. Our goal was to learn more about how COVID‐19 has impacted Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) training and practice across the country. To do so, real time, in‐depth experiences and opinions from persons within, or committed, to PM&R were pooled and this information was used to inform the creation of an anonymous survey that was distributed online to the PM&R community. 501 people completed the survey, 178 (35.5%) attending physicians, 183 (36.5%) residents and fellows, 29 (5.8%) interns, and 111 (22.2%) medical students. The survey results explore the impact of the global crisis on patient care and education in the field of PM&R. The adaptation from traditional patient care to telehealth was notable with 86.5% of physiatrists practicing via telemedicine during the pandemic. There was also a massive shift of education to virtual didactics with 92.5% of residents participating in virtual learning. The COVID‐19 pandemic has caused PM&R to revisit traditional routines in medical education and adapt to new practices to enhance educational experiences while still maintaining safe social distance between physicians, trainees and patients. Based on the survey results, the adaptations the PM&R community has made have provided a diversified, easily accessible platform for medical students, physiatrists‐in‐training and physiatrists across the country that has been full of innovation and collaboration between residencies and national organizations. We foresee continued, successful adoption of these new educational platforms and the use of telemedicine to enhance medical education and patient care post COVID‐19.

615678,Evaluating current chest imaging practices of pediatric patients with COVID-19: A retrospective analysis(),2021-08-27,"Airborne bacteria-containing bioaerosols have attracted increased research attention on account of their adverse effects on human health. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is an effective method to inactivate airborne microorganisms. The present study models and compares the inactivation performance of three UV sources in the UVGI for aerosolized Escherichia coli. Inactivation efficiency of 0.5, 2.2 and 3.1 logarithmic order was obtained at an exposure UV dose of 370 J/m(3) under UVA (365 nm), UVC (254 nm) and UVD (185 nm) sources, respectively. A Beer–Lambert law-based model was developed and validated to compare the inactivation performances of the UV sources, and modeling enabled prediction of inactivation efficiency and analysis of the sensitivity of several parameters. Low influent E. coli concentrations and high UV doses resulted in high energy consumption (EC). The change in airborne endotoxin concentration during UV inactivation was analyzed, and UVC and UVA irradiation showed no marked effect on endotoxin degradation. By contrast, both free and bound endotoxins could be removed by UVD treatment, which is attributed to the ozone generated by the UVD source. The results of this study can provide a better understanding of the air disinfection and airborne endotoxin removal processes.","Wang, Can; Lu, Siyi; Zhang, Zhiwei",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969718346230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30481706/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718346230; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.266,247
615878,"Ageusia and anosmia, a common sign of COVID-19? A case series from four countries",2020-07-14,"OBJECTIVE: Deep significance clustering (DICE) is a self-supervised learning framework. DICE identifies clinically similar and risk-stratified subgroups that neither unsupervised clustering algorithms nor supervised risk prediction algorithms alone are guaranteed to generate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Enabled by an optimization process that enforces statistical significance between the outcome and subgroup membership, DICE jointly trains 3 components, representation learning, clustering, and outcome prediction while providing interpretability to the deep representations. DICE also allows unseen patients to be predicted into trained subgroups for population-level risk stratification. We evaluated DICE using electronic health record datasets derived from 2 urban hospitals. Outcomes and patient cohorts used include discharge disposition to home among heart failure (HF) patients and acute kidney injury among COVID-19 (Cov-AKI) patients, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to baseline approaches including principal component analysis, DICE demonstrated superior performance in the cluster purity metrics: Silhouette score (0.48 for HF, 0.51 for Cov-AKI), Calinski-Harabasz index (212 for HF, 254 for Cov-AKI), and Davies-Bouldin index (0.86 for HF, 0.66 for Cov-AKI), and prediction metric: area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (0.83 for HF, 0.78 for Cov-AKI). Clinical evaluation of DICE-generated subgroups revealed more meaningful distributions of member characteristics across subgroups, and higher risk ratios between subgroups. Furthermore, DICE-generated subgroup membership alone was moderately predictive of outcomes. DISCUSSION: DICE addresses a gap in current machine learning approaches where predicted risk may not lead directly to actionable clinical steps. CONCLUSION: DICE demonstrated the potential to apply in heterogeneous populations, where having the same quantitative risk does not equate with having a similar clinical profile.","Huang, Yufang; Liu, Yifan; Steel, Peter A D; Axsom, Kelly M; Lee, John R; Tummalapalli, Sri Lekha; Wang, Fei; Pathak, Jyotishman; Subramanian, Lakshminarayanan; Zhang, Yiye",J Am Med Inform Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34571540/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocab203,247
616055,Covid Fast Fax: A system for real-time triage of Covid-19 case report faxes,2020-12-17,"INTRODUCTION: Seasonal influenza is a major global health problem causing substantial morbidity and health care costs. Yet, in many countries, the rates of influenza vaccination remain low. Chronic kidney or liver diseases (CKLD) predispose patients to severe influenza infections, but data on vaccination acceptance and status is limited in this risk population. We investigated the influenza vaccination awareness considering sociodemographic factors in CKLD patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study recruited CKLD patients managed at three Viennese tertiary care centers between July and October 2020. CKLD was defined as chronic kidney- (all stages) or compensated/decompensated liver disease, including kidney/liver transplant recipients. Questionnaires assessed sociodemographic and transplant- associated parameters, patients vaccination status and the individuals self-perceived risks of infection and associated complications. RESULTS: In total 516 patients (38.1% female, mean age 56.4 years) were included. 43.9% of patients declared their willingness to be vaccinated in the winter season 2020/2021, compared to 25.4% in 2019/2020 and 27.3% in 2016–2018. Vaccination uptake was associated with the self-perceived risks of infection (OR: 2.8 (95%CI: 1.8–4.5), p<0.001) and associated complications (OR: 3.8 (95%CI: 2.3–6.3), p<0.001) as well as with previously received influenza vaccination (2019/2020: OR 17.1 (95%CI: 9.5–30.7), p<0.001; season 2016–2018: OR 8.9 (95%CI: 5.5–14.5), p<0.001). Most frequent reasons for not planning vaccination were fear of a) graft injury (33.3%), b) complications after vaccination (32.4%) and c) vaccine inefficiency (15.0%). CONCLUSION: While influenza vaccination willingness in patients with CKLD is increasing in the 2020/2021 season, vaccination rates may still remain <50%. Novel co-operations with primary health care, active vaccination surveillance and financial reimbursement may substantially improve vaccination rates in high-risk CKLD patients.","Eder, Michael; Omic, Haris; Gorges, Jana; Badt, Florian; Kikic, Zeljko; Saemann, Marcus D.; Tong, Allison; Bauer, David; Semmler, Georg; Reiberger, Thomas; Lagler, Heimo; Scheiner, Bernhard",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33848305/,247

With each pathogen demonstrating a unique response to environmental conditions and the mechanical stresses it experiences, the choice of sampling device is not obvious. Our aim was to review bioaerosol sampling, sampling equipment, and methodology. A comprehensive literature search was performed, using electronic databases to retrieve English language papers on bioaerosol sampling. The review describes the mechanisms of popular bioaerosol sampling devices such as impingers, cyclones, impactors, and filters, explaining both their strengths and weaknesses, and the consequences for microbial bioefficiency. Numerous successful studies are described that point to best practice in bioaerosol sampling, from the use of small personal samplers to monitor workers' pathogen exposure through to large static samplers collecting airborne microbes in various healthcare settings. Of primary importance is the requirement that studies should commence by determining the bioefficiency of the chosen sampler and the pathogen under investigation within laboratory conditions. From such foundations, sampling for bioaerosol material in the complexity of the field holds greater certainty of successful capture of low-concentration airborne pathogens. From the laboratory to use in the field, this review enables the investigator to make informed decisions about the choice of bioaerosol sampler and its application.","Haig, C.W.; Mackay, W.G.; Walker, J.T.; Williams, C.",J Hosp Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27112048/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670116300044; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670116300044; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2016.03.017,247

The risk factors, prognosis, and outcome of patients with haematological cancers with coexistent COVID-19 need to be explored in different subsets of population. A single-institutional prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary level medical institute in North India. The clinical details of the recruited patients having haematological malignancies and diagnosed with COVID-19 between 15 March 2020 and 31 May 2021 were prospectively collected through the electronic patient database system. The outcomes with respect to 28-day and 56-day mortality and the associated risk factors for prognostication were analysed. Of the 5750 hospital admissions (inpatient and day-care) during the study period, two hundred and forty-two patients (4.2%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Acute leukaemia was the most common haematological malignancy, seen in 117 (48.3%) patients. Eighty-nine (36.8%) patients had moderate-to-severe COVID-19 while 153 (63.2%) patients presented with mild infection. The 28-day and 56-day mortality rates in our cohort were 13.3% and 19.8% respectively. Amongst the risk factors associated with poor outcome, the severity of COVID-19 (HR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.16–10.35; p = 0.04), presence of secondary infection (HR = 2.1, 95% CI 2.45–21.3; p = 0.023), and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (HR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.8–18.43; p = 0.01) were prognostically significant on multivariate log rank analysis. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection does not increase with haematological malignancies; however, the outcome remains poor in patients with severe COVID-19, requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation, and pre-existing bacterial/fungal infection at presentation.","Gupta, Anshul; Desai, Nihar; Sanjeev; Chauhan, Priyanka; Nityanand, Soniya; Hashim, Zia; Gupta, Mansi",Ann Hematol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00277-021-04644-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34559278/,247

We aimed to analyze patterns of behaviors regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in AIIRD patients, as a mean to identify pragmatic actions to increase vaccine coverage in this population. METHODS: Data of 1258 AIIRD patients were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, to identify variables associated independently with the willingness to get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Subsets of patients showing similar behaviors towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were characterized using cluster analysis. RESULTS: Hierarchical cluster analysis identified 3 distinct clusters of AIIRD patients. Three predominant patients’ behavior towards SARS-COV-2 vaccination: ‘voluntary’, ‘hesitant’ and ‘suspicious’ were identified. While vaccine willingness was significantly different across the 3 clusters p< 0.0001, there was no difference regarding the fear to get COVID-19 p= 0.11, the presence of co-morbidities p= 0.23, the use of glucocorticoids p= 0.21 or the immunocompromised status p= 0.63. However, patients from cluster #3 ‘suspicious’ were significantly more concerned about vaccination, the use of a new vaccine technology, the lack of hindsight regarding COVID vaccination and potential financial links with pharmaceutical companies p< 0.0001 in all than in the other 2 clusters. DISCUSSION: Importantly, the differences between patients’ behaviors are not related to the fear of getting COVID-19 or to any state of frailty, but point out to specific concerns about vaccination.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: CXR of 240 symptomatic patients (70% male, mean age 65 ± 16 years), with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR, was retrospectively evaluated. Patients were clustered in four groups based on the number of days between symptom onset and CXR: group A (0–2 days), 49 patients; group B (3–5), 75 patients; group C (6–9), 85 patients; and group D (> 9), 31 patients. Alteration’s type (reticular/ground-glass opacity (GGO)/consolidation) and distribution (bilateral/unilateral, upper/middle/lower fields, peripheral/central) were noted. Statistical significance was tested using chi-square test. RESULTS: Among 240 patients who underwent CXR, 180 (75%) showed alterations (group A, 63.3%; group B, 72%; group C, 81.2%; group D, 83.9%). GGO was observed in 124/180 patients (68.8%), reticular alteration in 113/180 (62.7%), and consolidation in 71/180 (39.4%). Consolidation was significantly less frequent (p < 0.01). Distribution among groups was as follows: reticular alteration (group A, 70.9%; group B, 72.2%; group C, 57.9%; group D, 46.1%), GGO (group A, 67.7%; group B, 62.9%; group C, 71%; group D, 76.9%), and consolidation (group A, 35.5%; group B, 31.4%; group C, 47.8%; group D, 38.5%). Alterations were bilateral in 73.3%. Upper, middle, and lower fields were involved in 36.7%, 79.4%, and 87.8%, respectively. Lesions were peripheral in 49.4%, central in 11.1%, or both in 39.4%. Upper fields and central zones were significantly less involved (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent lesions in COVID-19 patients were GGO (intermediate/late phase) and reticular alteration (early phase) while consolidation gradually increased over time. The most frequent distribution was bilateral, peripheral, and with middle/lower predominance. Overall rate of negative CXR was 25%, which progressively decreased over time. KEY POINTS: • The predominant lung changes were GGO and reticular alteration, while consolidation was less frequent. • The typical distribution pattern was bilateral, peripheral, or both peripheral and central and involved predominantly the lower and middle fields. • Chest radiography showed lung abnormalities in 75% of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, range varied from 63.3 to 83.9%, respectively, at 0–2 days and > 9 days from the onset of symptoms.","Vancheri, Sergio Giuseppe; Savietto, Giovanni; Ballati, Francesco; Maggi, Alessia; Canino, Costanza; Bortolotto, Chandra; Valentini, Adele; Dore, Roberto; Stella, Giulia Maria; Corsico, Angelo Guido; Iotti, Giorgio Antonio; Mojoli, Francesco; Perlini, Stefano; Bruno, Raffaele; Preda, Lorenzo",Eur Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32474630/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-06967-7,247
618656,Corrigendum,2020-10-14,"AIMS : The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in excess mortality due to both COVID-19 directly and other conditions, including cardiovascular (CV) disease. We aimed to explore the excess in-hospital mortality, unrelated to COVID-19 infection, across a range of CV diseases. METHODS AND RESULTS : A systematic search was performed for studies investigating in-hospital mortality among patients admitted with CV disease without SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with a period outside the COVID-19 pandemic. Fifteen studies on 27 421 patients with CV disease were included in the analysis. The average in-hospital mortality rate was 10.4% (n = 974) in the COVID-19 group and 5.7% (n = 1026) in the comparator group. Compared with periods outside the COVID-19 pandemic, the pooled risk ratio (RR) demonstrated increased in-hospital mortality by 62% during COVID-19 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20–2.20, P = 0.002]. Studies with a decline in admission rate >50% during the COVID-19 pandemic observed the greatest increase in mortality compared with those with <50% reduction [RR 2.74 (95% CI 2.43–3.10) vs. 1.21 (95% CI 1.07–1.37), P < 0.001]. The observed increased mortality was consistent across different CV conditions (P = 0.74 for interaction). CONCLUSIONS : In-hospital mortality among patients admitted with CV diseases was increased relative to periods outside the pandemic, independent of co-infection with COVID-19. This effect was larger in studies with the biggest decline in admission rates, suggesting a sicker cohort of patients in this period. However, studies were generally poorly conducted, and there is a need for further well-designed studies to establish the full extent of mortality not directly related to COVID-19 infection.","Cannata, Antonio; Watson, Samuel A; Daniel, Allen; Giacca, Mauro; Shah, Ajay M; McDonagh, Theresa A; Scott, Paul A; Bromage, Daniel I",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurjpc/zwab119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34297822/,247

Using data on cases and tests in France for the period between the first and second lock-downs—May 13 to October 25, 2020—our acceleration index shows that the pandemic resurgence can be dated to begin around July 7. It uncovers that the pandemic acceleration was stronger than national average for the [59–68] and especially the 69 and older age groups since early September, the latter being associated with the strongest acceleration index, as of October 25. In contrast, acceleration among the [19–28] age group was the lowest and is about half that of the [69–78]. In addition, we propose an algorithm to allocate tests among French “départements” (roughly counties), based on both the acceleration index and the feedback effect of testing. Our acceleration-based allocation differs from the actual distribution over French territories, which is population-based. We argue that both our acceleration index and our allocation algorithm are useful tools to guide public health policies as France might possibly enter a third lock-down period with indeterminate duration.","Baunez, Christelle; Degoulet, Mickael; Luchini, Stéphane; Pintus, Patrick A.; Teschl, Miriam",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34061892/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252443,247

METHODS: We collected epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and occupation information, along with contact history, of 671 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 reported from January 23 to February 5, 2020, in Henan province, China. We described characteristics of these cases, compared the diagnostic accuracy and features of blood testing, computed tomography (CT) scans and X-rays, and analysed SARS-CoV-2 transmission sources and patients’ occupations in Henan province. RESULTS: The mean age of patients in this case series was 43 years, 56.2% were male and 22.4% had coexisting medical disorders. The death rate was 0.3%. Fourteen patients did not show any symptoms. Lymphocyte percentage was associated with disease severity (χ(2) = 6.71, P = 0.035) but had a large variation in each sample group. The mean time from illness onset to diagnosis was 5.6 days. A total of 330 patients had ever lived in or visited Wuhan, 150 had contact with confirmed cases, 323 had been to a hospital and 119 had been to a wet market. There were 33 patients who did not have a traceable transmission source, with 21.2% of these being farmers and 15.2% being workmen. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocyte percentage was a sign of severe COVID-19 in general but was not a good diagnostic index. Longer time from illness onset to diagnosis was associated with higher COVID-19 severity, older age, higher likelihood of having coexisting cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, and being male.

The currently raging COVID-19 pandemic adds to the vast scale of destruction and suffering that humanity and the planet are experiencing. In this paper we explicate the meaning of ‘human-induced’ destruction in the terms of the damaging and hurting metaphysics (beyond the physical or material) that modern humanity has been entertaining in their conceptual and emotional minds and materially projecting onto the world. In turn, the damaging and hurting metaphysics is explicated in the terms of atomism that conceives all existents as self-existing and independent, necessarily engaged in competition against each other for survival. We propose to replace such metaphysics with one of the processual ontologies, such as that of Alfred North Whitehead, in which humans see themselves and each other as continuously interfusing and co-creatively re/e/merging relata of complete interdependence. This way, all of us, all the time, become “one with The Ten Thousand Things.”—an expression in Chinese for the phenomenal world of thriving diversity and conviviality. We further explore self-cultivation of inner work that aids the shift from ego self to eco self, such as meditative and arts-based practices.","Bai, Heesoon; Bowering, Scott; Haber, Jesse; Cohen, Avraham; Chang, David",Cult Stud Sci Educ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11422-021-10028-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897910/,247
619789,MADVent: A low‐cost ventilator for patients with COVID‐19,2020-06-05,"Measures to control SARS-CoV-2 often include the regular disinfection of public surfaces. The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 detection on surfaces in the surrounding of confirmed cases was evaluated in this systematic review. Overall, 26 studies showed 0 and 100% rates of contamination with SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces in the surrounding of patients. Seven studies with at least 100 samples mostly showed detection rates between 1.4 and 19%. Two other studies did not detect infectious SARS-CoV-2 on any surface. Similar results were obtained from surfaces in the surrounding of confirmed SARS- and influenza-patients. A contamination of public surfaces with infectious virus is considerably less likely because there are much less potential viral spreaders around a surface, the contact time between a person and the surface is much shorter, and the asymptomatic carriers typically have no symptoms. In addition, a hand contact with a contaminated surface transfers only a small part of the viral load. A simple cleaning reduces the number of infectious viruses already by 2 log (10) -steps. That is why public surfaces should in general be cleaned because the wide use of biocidal agents for surface disinfection further increases the microbial selection pressure without an expectable health benefit.","Kampf, Günter; Jatzwauk, Lutz",Gesundheitswesen,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33540430/; https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1335-4549,247

620245,Repositioning Vitamin C as a Promising Option to Alleviate Complications associated with COVID-19,2020-11-24,"INTRODUCTION: The Quality of life is a broad-ranging concept affected in a complex way by the person's physical health, psychological state, level of independence, social relationships, personal beliefs, and their relationship to salient features of their environment. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many quarantine and isolation measures and lockdown of the nation for the foreseeable future. Although these initiatives are necessary to prevent the spread of coronavirus they may be causing adverse mental health effects. Medical students are backbone and future of the health system and the general public always looks up to them as a role model of society. With this background, this study aims to assess the quality of life among medical students during the lockdown period amid the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A self-administered, pretested, questionnaire based on World Health Organization Quality of Life: Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) standard quality of life was used. For internal reliability and structural validity, Cronbach's alpha coefficient and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were calculated, respectively. t-test, one way ANOVA, and Pearson Chi-square test were used. RESULTS: The mean scores of domains of the present study were highest for the environmental domain (72.10 ± 13.0) followed by physical (67.23 ± 13.74), social (57.13 ± 20.1), and lowest for the psychological domain (52.10 ± 17.45). The level of internal consistency was found to be 0.883, which is considered as sufficiently reliable. One-third of the medical students were spending >6 h on-screen, and merely 15.6% were doing physical activity >1 h. CONCLUSION: It was found that during this time of crisis medical students were weaker in the psychological domain of Quality of Life among all the four domains. Physical activity and screen time was an important factor to the QOL of students, and it is likely that students would benefit from increased physical activity and minimizing screen time.","Chawla, Bharti; Chawla, Sumit; Singh, Harinder; Jain, Romesh; Arora, Ishan",J Family Med Prim Care,https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_715_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33409199/,247
620413,Covid-19 and Kawasaki Disease: A Glimpse at the Past for a Predictable Future,2020-05-27,"INTRODUCTION: Most SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests require nasopharyngeal sampling, which is frequently perceived as uncomfortable and requires healthcare professionals, thus limiting scale-up. Nasal sampling could enable self-sampling and increase acceptability. The term nasal sampling is often not used uniformly and sampling protocols differ. METHODS: This manufacturer-independent, prospective diagnostic accuracy study, compared professional anterior nasal and nasal mid-turbinate sampling for a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic test. The second group of participants collected a nasal mid-turbinate sample themselves and underwent a professional nasopharyngeal swab for comparison. The reference standard was real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using combined oro-/nasopharyngeal sampling. Individuals with high suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested. Sensitivity, specificity, and percent agreement were calculated. Self-sampling was observed without intervention. Feasibility was evaluated by observer and participant questionnaires. RESULTS: Among 132 symptomatic adults, both professional anterior nasal and nasal mid-turbinate sampling yielded a sensitivity of 86.1% (31/36 RT-PCR positives detected; 95%CI: 71.3–93.9) and a specificity of 100.0% (95%CI: 95.7–100). The positive percent agreement was 100% (95%CI: 89.0–100). Among 96 additional adults, self nasal mid-turbinate and professional nasopharyngeal sampling yielded an identical sensitivity of 91.2% (31/34; 95%CI 77.0–97.0). Specificity was 98.4% (95%CI: 91.4–99.9) with nasal mid-turbinate and 100.0% (95%CI: 94.2–100) with nasopharyngeal sampling. The positive percent agreement was 96.8% (95%CI: 83.8–99.8). Most participants (85.3%) considered self-sampling as easy to perform. CONCLUSION: Professional anterior nasal and nasal mid-turbinate sampling are of equivalent accuracy for an antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic test in ambulatory symptomatic adults. Participants were able to reliably perform nasal mid-turbinate sampling themselves, following written and illustrated instructions. Nasal self-sampling will facilitate scaling of SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing.","Nikolai, Olga; Rohardt, Chiara; Tobian, Frank; Junge, Andrea; Corman, Victor M.; Jones, Terry C.; Gaeddert, Mary; Lainati, Federica; Sacks, Jilian A.; Seybold, Joachim; Mockenhaupt, Frank P.; Denkinger, Claudia M.; Lindner, Andreas K.",Infect Dis (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2021.1969426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34445926/,247
620488,Clinical Manifestations of COVID-19 in the Feet: A Review of Reviews,2021-05-19,"Sepsis remains the leading cause of mortality in hospitalized patients, contributing to 1 in every 2–3 deaths. From a pathophysiological view, in the recent definition, sepsis has been defined as the result of a complex interaction between host response and the infecting organism, resulting in life-threatening organ dysfunction, depending on microcirculatory derangement, cellular hypoxia/dysoxia driven by hypotension and, potentially, death. The high energy expenditure driven by a high metabolic state induced by the host response may rapidly lead to micronutrient depletion. This deficiency can result in alterations in normal energy homeostasis, free radical damage, and immune system derangement. In critically ill patients, micronutrients are still relegated to an ancillary role in the whole treatment, and always put in a second-line place or, frequently, neglected. Only some micronutrients have attracted the attention of a wider audience, and some trials, even large ones, have tested their use, with controversial results. The present review will address this topic, including the recent advancement in the study of vitamin D and protocols based on vitamin C and other micronutrients, to explore an update in the setting of sepsis, gain some new insights applicable to COVID-19 patients, and to contribute to a pathophysiological definition of the potential role of micronutrients that will be helpful in future dedicated trials.","Rossetti, Matteo; Martucci, Gennaro; Starchl, Christina; Amrein, Karin",Medicina (Kaunas),https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57050419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33925791/,247
621001,Comments on: Retinal vein occlusion in COVID-19: A novel entity,2021-01-11,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world’s perspective and had a profound impact on all those residing in the United Kingdom, resulting in unprecedented changes being made to the education and training of healthcare students. Universities and practice partners had to respond quickly and work in close collaboration with their wider system partners, Health Education England and the Department of Health, to ensure the changes made within the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) emergency measures were implemented. The aim was to explore the experiences of final year diagnostic and therapeutic radiography students who joined the HCPC temporary register during phase one of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This study was informed by a phenomenological approach, in which a purposeful sample of seventeen participants comprising of nine students, six practice educators and two academics were chosen to participate. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted to collect the data via a virtual platform. Results The results highlighted three themes, professionalism and transition to registration, benefits and challenges of working through a pandemic, and emotional impact. Students described how they gained confidence and competence during their time on the temporary register and suggested that professional bodies could consider curriculum changes to encompass a final transitional placement similar to their experience. They said they had been well supported but felt a sense of loss having been denied the normal rite of passage associated with completion of their course and graduation. Conclusion The results provide insight into how students, practice educators and academics transformed their practice to meet the necessary requirements whilst working during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. They highlight the importance of having good support mechanisms in place and the rewards and challenges for students joining their professional register early. Implications for practice Some consideration could be made to changing the curriculum in the future to allow for early temporary registration and paid Band 4 final placements for students working as assistant practitioners.","Cushen-Brewster, Noreen; Strudwick, Ruth M.; Doolan, Caroline; Driscoll-Evans, Paul",Radiography (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2021.03.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078817421000262?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814306/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078817421000262,247
621482,The pressing questions in multiple sclerosis Care in the era of COVID-19,2020-06-23,"When actively taking measures to control an epidemic, an important indicator of success is crossing the ""peak"" of daily new infections. The peak is a positive sign which marks the end of the exponential phase of infection spread and a transition into a phase that is a manageable. Most countries or provinces with similar but independent growth trajectories had taken drastic measures for containing the COVID-19 pandemic and are eagerly waiting to cross the peak. However, the data after many weeks of strict measures suggests that most provinces instead enter a phase where the infections are in a linear growth. While the transition out of an exponential phase is relieving, the roughly constant number of daily new infections differ widely, range from around 50 in Singapore to around 2000 just in Lombardy (Italy), and 7600 in Spain. The daily new infection rate of a region seems to depend heavily on the time point in the exponential evolution when the restrictive measures were adopted, rather than on the population of the region. It is not easy to point the critical source of these persistent infections. We attempt to interpret this data using a simple model of newer infections mediated by asymptomatic patients, which underscores the importance of actively identifying any potential leakages in the quarantine. Given the novelty of the virus, it is hard to predict too far into the future and one needs to be observant to see if a plan B is needed as a second round of interventions. So far, the peak achieved by most countries with the first round of intervention is extremely flat.","Ansumali, Santosh; Prakash, Meher K",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20055772,247

Method: An online-based, nationwide, and cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 1,167 respondents were recruited from June 19 to July 2, 2020. All participants completed a validated questionnaire written in Chinese. Electronic consent was obtained from all participants upon their agreement to commence the questionnaire. Perceived efficacy, safety, and their attitudes toward the use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing kits were measured. Result: The majority of the study respondents were female [749 (64.2%)], aged 31–40 years old [372 (31.9%)], and located in mainland China [1,137 (97.4%)]. The majority of the respondents held a positive view toward the introduction of the fast-track approval policy for novel coronavirus testing products (6.16 ± 1.30) as well as toward putting more investment in scientific research and biomedicine to improve the detection accuracy of detection kits (5.94 ± 1.55) in China. The respondents valued the detection accuracy more as opposed to the detection time of the testing kits (4.66 ± 2.00), whereas few participants agreed that in the research and development process, detection accuracy could be sacrificed to speed up production and coverage capacity (3.02 ± 2.04). Conclusion: The majority of the participants have a basic knowledge of the detection methods of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the types of test kits, as well as great confidence in China's domestic production of test kits and decisions. However, how basic knowledge, high compliance, and positive attitudes play a role in easing the tension of the pandemic still remains unknown.","Lan, Ruirui; Sujanto, Robin; Lu, Kengbo; He, Zonglin; Zhang, Casper J.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effects of fear of COVID-19 on the mental well-being and quality of life among Saudi adult population and to evaluate the impact of perceived social support. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study used an anonymous online survey, where participants were administered the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, European Health Interview Survey-Quality of Life and Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey. A path analysis was used to investigate the proposed theoretical domain structure linking fear of COVID-19 with perceived social support, mental well-being and quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 1029 Saudi adults with a mean age of 33.7 years (SD 11.5) responded to the survey. Descriptive analysis showed that this sample was fearful of COVID-19, anxious and depressed but, at the same time, reported high quality of life and perceived social support scores. Path analysis indicated that increased fear of COVID-19 was directly associated with diminished mental well-being, which in turn was associated with lower quality of life. The beneficial effects of perceived social support were stronger on quality of life than on mental well-being. No direct link was found between fear of COVID-19 and quality of life.

622430,Perceived clinical utility of a test for predicting inadequate response to TNF inhibitor therapies in rheumatoid arthritis: results from a decision impact study,2020-11-30,"The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) is one of the molecular targets for drug design. Effective vaccines have been identified as a long-term solution but the rate at which they are being administered is slow in several countries, and mutations of SARS-CoV-2 could render them less effective. Moreover, remdesivir seems to work only with some types of COVID-19 patients. Hence, the continuous investigation of new treatments for this disease is pivotal. This study investigated the inhibitory role of natural products against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) as repurposable agents in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Through in silico approach, selected flavonoids were docked into the active site of M(pro). The free energies of the ligands complexed with M(pro) were computationally estimated using the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) method. In addition, the inhibition process of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with these ligands was simulated at 100 ns in order to uncover the dynamic behavior and complex stability. The docking results showed that the selected flavonoids exhibited good poses in the binding domain of M(pro). The amino acid residues involved in the binding of the selected ligands correlated well with the residues involved with the mechanism-based inhibitor (N3) and the docking score of Quercetin-3-O-Neohesperidoside (−16.8 Kcal/mol) ranked efficiently with this inhibitor (−16.5 Kcal/mol). In addition, single-structure MM/GBSA rescoring method showed that Quercetin-3-O-Neohesperidoside (−87.60 Kcal/mol) is more energetically favored than N3 (−80.88 Kcal/mol) and other ligands (Myricetin 3-Rutinoside (−87.50 Kcal/mol), Quercetin 3-Rhamnoside (−80.17 Kcal/mol), Rutin (−58.98 Kcal/mol), and Myricitrin (−49.22 Kcal/mol). The molecular dynamics simulation (MDs) pinpointed the stability of these complexes over the course of 100 ns with reduced RMSD and RMSF. Based on the docking results and energy calculation, together with the RMSD of 1.98 ± 0.19 Å and RMSF of 1.00 ± 0.51 Å, Quercetin-3-O-Neohesperidoside is a better inhibitor of M(pro) compared to N3 and other selected ligands and can be repurposed as a drug candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, this study demonstrated that in silico docking, free energy calculations, and MDs, respectively, are applicable to estimating the interaction, energetics, and dynamic behavior of molecular targets by natural products and can be used to direct the development of novel target function modulators.","Fadaka, Adewale Oluwaseun; Sibuyi, Nicole Remaliah Samantha; Martin, Darius Riziki; Klein, Ashwil; Madiehe, Abram; Meyer, Mervin",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22179431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502340/,247

It is based on this potential for trust “between producers and consumers” that AFNs have emerged as a significant field of food studies analysis as it also suggests a capacity for AFNs to foster associated embedded qualities, like ‘morality’, ‘social justice’, ‘ecology’ and ‘equity’. These positive benefits of AFNs, however, cannot be taken for granted as trust is not necessarily an outcome of AFN participation. Using Chinese case studies of AFNs, which are characterised by a distinct form of trust pressure—consumers who are particularly cynical about small scale farmers, food safety and the organic credentials of producers—this paper highlights how the dynamics of trust are in constant flux between producers and consumers. I suggest that it is the careful construction of the aesthetic and multi-sensory qualities of food, which is often celebrated via social media, that human centred relations in Chinese AFNs are mediated. This leads to two key conclusions: first, that the key variable for establishing trust is satisfying the consumer's desire for safe (i.e. ""fresh"") food; and second, the materiality of the food and the perception of foods materiality (especially through social media), must both be actively constructed by the farmer to fit the consumer's ideal of freshness.","Martindale, Leigh",Agric Human Values,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071451/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-020-10155-0,247

Such electrically operated standing scooters can be driven at a maximum speed of 20 km/h. A helmet is not mandatory. The aim of this prospective study is to document the injury patterns over the period of 1 year and compare our findings with already available data. METHODS: Over a period of 1 year (July 2019–July 2020), data on E-scooter-related accidents treated at a level 1 trauma center of a major German city were prospectively documented. Injury patterns were analyzed, and epidemiological data evaluated. RESULTS: Fifty-nine (35 female, 24 male) accidents were included in the observation period. Mean age of accident victims was 30.03 years (± 9.32). Alcohol influence at the time of accident was detected in 9 cases (15.25%). Many of the accident victims suffered multiple injuries. Most of the injuries were upper (50.84%) and lower extremity (47.45%) as well as craniofacial injuries (62.71%). A helmet was not worn in any of the cases. CONCLUSION: In the year following their introduction, E-scooter-related accidents have led to an additional burden on the emergency capacities of the involved University Hospital, especially in the summer months of 2019.

Moreover, the limited vaccine supply raises questions on how they can be used effectively. To examine the optimal allocation of COVID-19 vaccines in South Korea, we constructed an age-structured mathematical model, calibrated using country-specific demographic and epidemiological data. The optimal control problem was formulated with the aim of finding time-dependent age-specific optimal vaccination strategies to minimize costs related to COVID-19 infections and vaccination, considering a limited vaccine supply and various vaccine effects on susceptibility and symptomatology. Our results suggest that “susceptibility-reducing” vaccines should be relatively evenly distributed among all age groups, resulting in more than 40% of eligible age groups being vaccinated. In contrast, “symptom-reducing” vaccines should be administered mainly to individuals aged 20–29 and ≥60 years. Thus, our study suggests that the vaccine profile should determine the optimal vaccination strategy. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding vaccine’s effects on susceptibility and symptomatology for effective public health interventions.","Choi, Wongyeong; Shim, Eunha",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10132813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202324/,247

To address this requirement, it is necessary to strengthen capacity and expand the training opportunities to ensure equitable and efficient development of core professional competencies for specific contexts and educational needs. METHODS AND RESULTS: A competency-based training programme for Breast Surgeons was built and was applied based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). This framework provides a pragmatic structure for approaching complex interactions, multi-level and transient constructs in the real world. CFIR guided the implementation process and verified what works, where and why across each step. CFIR guided implementation was through an adaptable approach of the domains and creating relevant constructs that set up an ideal roadmap to analyse and improve learning needs, the curriculum design and the learning environment. CONCLUSION: The outcomes described in this manuscript demonstrate that evidence-based principles can be implemented in health professionals’ training and clinical practice even in resource-constrained settings. Building strong and sustainable healthcare workforce capacity is an urgent need for improved health service delivery and addresses real-life workplace needs in low-middle income countries. This programme integrates training with service to solve problems and develop initiatives to address existing local health priorities. While the article focuses on a training programme development, findings are shared to promote dissemination into other settings.","Aponte-Rueda, María Eugenia; Nieves, Maybell",Ecancermedicalscience,https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2021.1203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33889212/,247

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic literature review of data was to expose the relations between cannabis, cocaine or heroin use and asthma. RESULTS: Cannabis, cocaine or heroin use by inhalation may be responsible for respiratory symptoms (cough, wheezing), asthma onset, acute asthma exacerbations (which may require intubation and invasive ventilation) or deaths related to asthma. Lower adherence to asthma treatment is also observed. Cannabis induces a rapid bronchodilator effect. In contrast, its chronic use may induce a decrease in specific airway conductance. Studies on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) reduction or decline are discordant. CONCLUSION: Cannabis, cocaine or heroin use must be considered in cases of acute respiratory symptoms or asthma exacerbation in young persons and practitioners must help illicit substance users to stop their consumption.","Underner, M.; Peiffer, G.; Perriot, J.; Jaafari, N.",Rev Mal Respir,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761842520302035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0761842520302035,247

The virus has demonstrated itself to be extremely transmissible and deadly. Recent data suggest that a targeted approach is key to mitigating infectivity. Due to the proliferation of cataloged protein and nucleic acid sequences in databases, the function of the nucleic acid, and genetic encoded proteins, we make predictions by simply aligning sequences and exploring their homology. Thus, similar amino acid sequences in a protein usually confer similar biochemical function, even from distal or unrelated organisms. To understand viral transmission and adhesion, it is key to elucidate the structural, surface, and functional properties of each viral protein. This is typically first modeled in highly pathogenic species by exploring folding, hydrophobicity, and isoelectric point (IEP). Recent evidence from viral RNA sequence modeling and protein crystals have been inadequate, which prevent full understanding of the IEP and other viral properties of SARS-CoV-2. We have thus experimentally determined the IEP of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest that for enveloped viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, estimates of IEP by the amino acid sequence alone may be unreliable. We compared the experimental IEP of SARS-CoV-2 to variants of interest (VOIs) using their amino acid sequence, thus providing a qualitative comparison of the IEP of VOIs.","Areo, Oluwatoyin; Joshi, Pratik U.; Obrenovich, Mark; Tayahi, Moncef; Heldt, Caryn L.",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9081606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442686/,247

As students, we were facing a review of the literature for our dissertations. We encountered several different ways of conducting a review but were unable to locate any resources that synthesized all of the various synthesis methodologies. Our purpose is to present a comprehensive overview and assessment of the main approaches to research synthesis. We use ‘research synthesis’ as a broad overarching term to describe various approaches to combining, integrating, and synthesizing research findings. METHODS: We conducted an integrative review of the literature to explore the historical, contextual, and evolving nature of research synthesis. We searched five databases, reviewed websites of key organizations, hand-searched several journals, and examined relevant texts from the reference lists of the documents we had already obtained. RESULTS: We identified four broad categories of research synthesis methodology including conventional, quantitative, qualitative, and emerging syntheses. Each of the broad categories was compared to the others on the following: key characteristics, purpose, method, product, context, underlying assumptions, unit of analysis, strengths and limitations, and when to use each approach. CONCLUSIONS: The current state of research synthesis reflects significant advancements in emerging synthesis studies that integrate diverse data types and sources. New approaches to research synthesis provide a much broader range of review alternatives available to health and social science students and researchers.","Schick-Makaroff, Kara; MacDonald, Marjorie; Plummer, Marilyn; Burgess, Judy; Neander, Wendy",AIMS Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3934/publichealth.2016.1.172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29546155/,247

Using generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson distribution, we modeled associations between social distancing and COVID-19 incidence and mortality, and multiplicative interaction terms to assess effect modification. In multivariable models, each unit increase in social distancing was associated with a 26% decrease (p < 0.0001) in COVID-19 incidence and a 31% decrease (p < 0.0001) in COVID-19 mortality. Percent crowding, minority population, and median household income were all statistically significant effect modifiers.

The available interventions are only supportive and palliative in nature. Popular among the emerging explanations for the mortality from COVID-19 is “cytokine storm”, attributed to the body’s aggressive immune response to this novel pathogen. In less than a year the disease has spread to almost all countries, though the mortality rates have varied significantly from country to country based on factors such as the demographical mix of the population, prevalence of comorbidities, as well as prior exposure to viruses from the corona family. This review examines the current literature on mortality rates across the globe, explores the possible reasons, thereby decoding variations. COVID-19 researchers have noted unique characteristics in the structural and host-pathogen interaction and identified several possible target proteins and sites that could exhibit control over the entry of SARS CoV-2 into the host, which this paper reviews in detail. Identification of new targets, both in the virus and the host, may accelerate the search for effective vaccines and curative drugs against COVID-19. Further, the ontological approach of this review is likely to provide insights for researchers to anticipate and be ready for future mutant viruses that may emerge in future.","Jayachandran, Swaminathan K.; Anusuyadevi, Muthuswamy; Essa, Mohamed Mustafa; Qoronfleh, M.

The most important aspect of saliva sampling approach is the convenience of obtaining material by self- sampling that is even possible at home. In our experiments, saliva was sufficiently stable for testing for at least 24 hours after collection. The results obtained from the saliva of a SARS-CoV-2 positive patient were consistent with those obtained from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from the same patient with the sensitivity 90% and specificity 100% during the first two weeks after the onset of symptoms. To demonstrate the usefulness of testing saliva material for mass screening, crowd sampling with pooling was performed on 3660 people in 3-day time (44 samples were tested positive).

We have investigated the kinds of slippery sequence that can function at the IBV frameshift site by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of slippery-sequence mutants. We firstly confirmed that the site of frameshifting in IBV was at the heptanucleotide stretch UUUAAAC, and then used our knowledge of the pseudoknot structure and a suitable reporter gene to prepare an expression construct that allowed both the magnitude and direction of ribosomal frameshifting to be determined for candidate slippery sequences. Our results show that in almost all of the sequences tested, frameshifting is strictly into the −1 reading frame. Monotonous runs of nucleotides, however, gave detectable levels of a −2 +1 frameshift product, and U stretches in particular gave significant levels (2% to 21%). Preliminary evidence suggests that the RNA pseudoknot may play a role in influencing frameshift direction. The spectrum of slip-sequences tested in this analysis included all those known or suspected to be utilized in vivo. Our results indicate that triplets of A, C, G and U are functional when decoded in the ribosomal P-site following slippage ( XXX YYYN) although C triplets were the least effective. In the A-site (XXY YYY N), triplets of C and G were non-functional. The identity of the nucleotide at position 7 of the slippery sequence (XXXYYY N ) was found to be a critical determinant of frameshift efficiency and we show that a hierarchy of frameshifting exists for A-site codons. These observations lead us to suggest that ribosomal frameshifting at a particular site is determined, at least in part, by the strength of the interaction of normal cellular tRNAs with the A-site codon and does not necessarily involve specialized “shifty” tRNAs.","Brierley, Ian; Jenner, Alison J.; Inglis, Stephen C.",Journal of Molecular Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1404364/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/002228369290901U; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002228369290901U,247

In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of how cytosolic sensing of DNA is controlled during inflammatory immune responses.","Abe, Takayuki; Shapira, Sagi D.",Int Rev Cell Mol Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1937644818301084; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ircmb.2018.09.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1937644818301084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798991/,247
633677,Transcriptional differences for COVID-19 Disease Map genes between males and females indicate a different basal immunophenotype relevant to the disease,2020-10-01,"The world is facing multiple healthcare challenges because of the emergence of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. The pandemic has exposed the limitations of handling public healthcare emergencies using existing digital healthcare technologies. Thus, the COVID-19 situation has forced research institutes and countries to rethink healthcare delivery solutions to ensure continuity of services while people stay at home and practice social distancing. Recently, several researchers have focused on disruptive technologies, such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), to improve the digital healthcare workflow during COVID-19. Blockchain could combat pandemics by enabling decentralized healthcare data sharing, protecting users’ privacy, providing data empowerment, and ensuring reliable data management during outbreak tracking. In addition, AI provides intelligent computer-aided solutions by analyzing a patient’s medical images and symptoms caused by coronavirus for efficient treatments, future outbreak prediction, and drug manufacturing. Integrating both blockchain and AI could transform the existing healthcare ecosystem by democratizing and optimizing clinical workflows. In this article, we begin with an overview of digital healthcare services and problems that have arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, we conceptually propose a decentralized, patient-centric healthcare framework based on blockchain and AI to mitigate COVID-19 challenges. Then, we explore the significant applications of integrated blockchain and AI technologies to augment existing public healthcare strategies for tackling COVID-19. Finally, we highlight the challenges and implications for future research within a patient-centric paradigm.","Jabarulla, Mohamed Yaseen; Lee, Heung-No",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442156/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9081019,247
633732,Ischemic Stroke: An Underestimated Complication of COVID-19,2021-06-01,"Background and aims Retrospective studies have shown that angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are associated with a reduced risk of complications and mortality in persons with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, we aimed to examine the efficacy of ramipril, an ACE-inhibitor, in preventing ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and/or mortality while also minimizing the risk of transmission and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Methods RAMIC is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, allocation-concealed, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy of treatment with ramipril 2.5 mg orally daily compared to placebo for 14 days. The study population includes adult patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to a hospital or assessed in an emergency department or ambulatory clinic. Key exclusion criteria include ICU admission or need for mechanical ventilation at screening, use of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor-II blocker within 7 days, glomerular filtration rate < 40 mL/min or a systolic blood pressure (BP) < 100 mmHg or diastolic BP < 65 mmHg. Patients are randomized 2:1 to receive ramipril (2.5 mg) or placebo daily. Informed consent and study visits occur virtually to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and preserve PPE. The primary composite endpoint of ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation and death are adjudicated virtually. Conclusions RAMIC is designed to assess the efficacy of treatment with ramipril for 14 days to decrease ICU admission, mechanical ventilator use and mortality in patients with COVID-19 and leverages virtual study visits and endpoint adjudication to mitigate risk of infection and to preserve PPE (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04366050).","Ajmera, Veeral; Thompson, Wesley K.; Smith, Davey M.; Malhotra, Atul; Mehta, Ravindra L.; Tolia, Vaishal; Yin, Jeffrey; Sriram, Krishna; Insel, Paul A.; Collier, Summer; Richards, Lisa; Loomba, Rohit",Contemp Clin Trials,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33631357/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2021.106330; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1551714421000665; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551714421000665?v=s5,247

The deciding factor for HCW voluntary vaccination is the risk of disease exposure versus the risk of vaccine adverse events. In a United States military population, with careful screening to exclude atopic dermatitis/eczema and immunosuppression, over 1 million vaccinia (smallpox) vaccinations were delivered with one fatality attributed to vaccination. Among 37 901 United States civilian volunteer HCWs vaccinated, 100 serious adverse events were reported including 10 ischemic cardiac episodes and six myocardial infarctions – two were fatal. This older population had a higher rate of adverse events due to age-related coronary artery disease. T-cell mediated inflammatory processes induced by live vaccinia vaccination may have a role in the observed acute coronary artery events. With exclusion of individuals at risk for coronary artery disease, atopic dermatitis/eczema, and immunosuppression, HCWs can be smallpox vaccinated with minimal risk. A carefully screened multidisciplinary cadre (physician, nurse, infection control practitioner, technician), pre-event vaccinated for smallpox, will supply the necessary leadership to alleviate fear and uncertainty while limiting spread and initial mortality of smallpox.","Malone, John D.",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17306582/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971207000021; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971207000021,247

The present systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to provide a precise summary of the effect of DPP4i use (preadmission or in-hospital) and mortality in COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: PubMed and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched using appropriate keywords to 4 January 2021, to identify observational studies reporting mortality in COVID-19 patients with DM using DPP4i versus those not using DPP4i. Preadmission and in-hospital use of DPP4i were considered. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Unadjusted and adjusted pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Subgroup analysis was performed for studies reporting preadmission and in-hospital use of DPP4i. RESULTS: We identified nine observational studies of high quality pooling data retrieved from 7008 COVID-19 patients with DM. The pooled analysis of unadjusted and adjusted data did not show any significant association between DPP4i use and mortality in COVID-19 patients with DM. However, on subgroup analysis, we found that in-hospital (and not preadmission) DPP4i use was associated with reduced mortality (unadjusted OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23, 0.58, p < 0.0001, I(2) = 0% and adjusted OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13, 0.55, p = 0.0003, I(2) = 12%). CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital use of DPP4i is associated with a significant reduction in COVID-19 mortality. Hence, it would be prudent to initiate or continue DPP4i in COVID-19 patients with DM if not contraindicated.","Pal, Rimesh; Banerjee, Mainak; Mukherjee, Soham; Bhogal, Ranjitpal Singh; Kaur, Amanpreet; Bhadada, Sanjay K.",Ther Adv Endocrinol Metab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33680425/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2042018821996482,247

Our study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on HW’s mental wellbeing. We analyzed the correlations between levels of burnout and other mental health disorders and we searched for the presence of specific risk factors of post-traumatic symptomatology related to the pandemic. A structured an on-line questionnaire and validated instruments were completed by a sample of HW from some hospitals in Genoa, Italy. Anxious, depressive, post-traumatic and other psychological symptoms were assessed and risk factors, related to the pandemic, were considered. Then, we investigated the correlation between levels of burnout and the risk of developing psychopathology. A total of 731 HW were screened, and we found increased levels of anxiety (61%), depression (62%), PTSD (34%) and high levels of burnout; especially emotional exhaustion (37%). A statistically significant association between burnout and insomnia, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms was demonstrated. This study indicates that during the COVID-19 pandemic, HW showed high levels of psychological distress and that burnout is an important predictor of sufferance. These findings support the idea to provide psychological and psychiatric support for HW.","Ghio, Lucio; Patti, Sara; Piccinini, Giulia; Modafferi, Cinzia; Lusetti, Eleonora; Mazzella, Massimo; Del Sette, Massimo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574851/,247

We aimed to describe the impact of this screening on the local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Methods: All high-risk contacts, as well as the individuals living in their households, were screened. We detailed the evolution of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Lot-et-Garonne department and the rest of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. Results: Among the 89 screened individuals, 10 new cases were confirmed, including 4 asymptomatic persons. In Lot-et-Garonne, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases immediately decreased after this screening and no epidemic peak occurred, contrary to what was observed in the rest of the region.

Data are lacking regarding humoral response to COVID vaccination in immunocompromised patients. Description We investigated early serological response after COVID 19 vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine in groups of patients undergoing hemodialysis (n =78), kidney transplant recipients (n = 74), and in healthy controls. Antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 at days 0, 14, 28, 36 and 58 after the first injection were measured. Methods Antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 at days 0, 14, 28, 36 and 58 after the first injection were measured. Results A total of 74 transplant recipients (mean age 64.8±11.5 years, 38.9% women), 78 hemodialysis patients (mean age 73.5±12.8 years, 40.2% women) and 7 healthy controls (mean age 51.6±6.8, 42% women) were included. In controls, antibodies were detected at a significant level (>13 AU/ml) at day 14 post-injection, and increased progressively, to peak at day 36 (median 1372 AU/mL [IQR 490.2-4540.5]). Patients undergoing hemodialysis had lower titers that peaked at day 58 (median 4.0 AU/mL [IQR: 1.85-12.2] at day 14; 6.6 AU/mL [IQR 2.1-19.0] at day 36; 276 AU/mL [IQR 83.4-526.0] at day 58). A significant antibody level was detected in only 3 kidney transplant recipients at day 36. In hemodialysis patients, age, serum albumin and Kt/V were positively correlated with serological response (P <0.043 and P < 0.019 respectively); non responders to HBV vaccine had the lowest titers of anti-SARS-CovV-2 antibodies (Fig. 1). Conclusion Our results suggest that the post-vaccine humoral response is strongly inhibited by immunosuppressant therapy in kidney transplant recipients, while it is lowered by the uremic condition in patients undergoing hemodialysis.","Touré, F.; Danthu, C.; Hantz, S.; Duval, M.; El Ouafi, Z.; Allot, V.; Bocquentin, F.; Rerolle, J.

Patient characteristics and the concentration of eight air pollutants [namely, NO (nitrogen monoxide), NO(2) (nitrogen dioxide), CO (carbon monoxide), PM2.5 (particulate matter 2.5), PM10 (particulate matter 10), O(3) (ozone), SO(2) (sulfur dioxide) and benzene] were considered. A total of 153 consecutive hospital admissions were studied. Reduced admissions occurred in the Lockdown period compared to the Pre-lockdown 2020 (p < 0.001) or the Control 2019 (p = 0.007) period. Furthermore, the concentration of 6/8 air pollutants positively correlated with weekly hospital admissions in 2020 and significantly decreased during the lockdown. Finally, admitted patients for asthma exacerbation during the lockdown were younger (p = 0.046) and less frequently presented respiratory failure (p = 0.038), whereas patients with COPD presented higher blood eosinophil percentage (p = 0.017) and count (p = 0.012). Overall, admissions for asthma and COPD exacerbations decreased during the lockdown. This might be partially explained by reduction of air pollution during this period while medical care avoidance behavior, especially among elderly patients cannot be excluded.

However, we need deeper phenotyping to disentangle the impact of adversity during sensitive periods from that across the total lifespan. This study examined whether retrospective reports of adversity during childhood or pregnancy were associated with inflammatory imbalance, in an ethnically diverse cohort of 53 low-income women seeking family-based trauma treatment following exposure to interpersonal violence. Structured interviews assessed early life adversity (trauma exposure ≤ age 5), pregnancy adversity, and total lifetime adversity. Blood serum was assayed for pro-inflammatory (TNF-a, IL-1ß, IL-6, and CRP) and anti-inflammatory (IL-1RA, IL-4, and IL-10) cytokines. CD14+ monocytes were isolated in a subsample (n = 42) and gene expression assayed by RNA sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 4000; TruSeq cDNA library). The primary outcome was a macrophage-associated M1/M2 gene expression phenotype. To evaluate sensitivity and specificity, we contrasted M1/M2 gene expression with a second, clinically-validated macrophage-associated immunosuppressive phenotype (endotoxin tolerance) and with pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels. Adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, and psychopathology, higher adversity in early life (ß = .337, p = 0.029) and pregnancy (ß = .332, p = 0.032) were each associated with higher M1/M2 gene expression, whereas higher lifetime adversity (ß = −.341, p = 0.031) was associated with lower immunosuppressive gene expression. Adversity during sensitive periods was uniquely associated with M1/M2 imbalance, among low-income women with interpersonal violence exposure. Given that M1/M2 imbalance is found in sepsis, severe COVID-19 and myriad chronic diseases, these findings implicate novel immune mechanisms underlying the impact of adversity on health.","Aschbacher, Kirstin; Hagan, Melissa; Steine, Iris M.; Rivera, Luisa; Cole, Steve; Baccarella, Alyssa; Epel, Elissa S.; Lieberman, Alicia; Bush, Nicole R.",Transl Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01498-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34282132/,247

This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data, we compare within-host viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 with analogous dynamics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Our quantitative analyses using a mathematical model revealed that the within-host reproduction number at symptom onset of SARS-CoV-2 was statistically significantly larger than that of MERS-CoV and similar to that of SARS-CoV. In addition, the time from symptom onset to the viral load peak for SARS-CoV-2 infection was shorter than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. These findings suggest the difficulty of controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection by antivirals. We further used the viral dynamics model to predict the efficacy of potential antiviral drugs that have different modes of action. The efficacy was measured by the reduction in the viral load area under the curve (AUC). Our results indicate that therapies that block de novo infection or virus production are likely to be effective if and only if initiated before the viral load peak (which appears 2–3 days after symptom onset), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity of infected cells are likely to have effects with less sensitivity to the timing of treatment initiation. Furthermore, combining a therapy that promotes cytotoxicity and one that blocks de novo infection or virus production synergistically reduces the AUC with early treatment. Our unique modeling approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and may be useful for development of antiviral therapies.","Kim, Kwang Su; Ejima, Keisuke; Iwanami, Shoya; Fujita, Yasuhisa; Ohashi, Hirofumi; Koizumi, Yoshiki; Asai, Yusuke; Nakaoka, Shinji; Watashi, Koichi; Aihara, Kazuyuki; Thompson, Robin N.; Ke, Ruian; Perelson, Alan S.; Iwami, Shingo",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750978/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001128,247

637605,Renal Involvement in COVID-19: A Review of the Literature,2021-03-05,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and concomitant governmental responses have created the need for innovative and collaborative approaches to deliver services, especially for populations that have been inequitably affected. In Alberta, Canada, two novel approaches were created in Spring 2020 to remotely support patients with complex neurological conditions and rehabilitation needs. The first approach is a telehealth service that provides wayfinding and self-management advice to Albertans with physical concerns related to existing neurological or musculoskeletal conditions or post-COVID-19 recovery needs. The second approach is a webinar series aimed at supporting self-management and social connectedness of individuals living with spinal cord injury. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to evaluate the short- and long-term impacts and sustainability of two virtual modalities (telehealth initiative called Rehabilitation Advice Line [RAL] and webinar series called Alberta Spinal Cord Injury Community Interactive Learning Seminars [AB-SCILS]) aimed at advancing self-management, connectedness, and rehabilitation needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. METHODS: We will use a mixed-methods evaluation approach. Evaluation of the approaches will include one-on-one semistructured interviews and surveys. The evaluation of the telehealth initiative will include secondary data analyses and analysis of call data using artificial intelligence. The evaluation of the webinar series will include analysis of poll questions collected during the webinars and YouTube analytics data. RESULTS: The proposed study describes unique pandemic virtual modalities and our approaches to evaluating them to ensure effectiveness and sustainability. Implementing and evaluating these virtual modalities synchronously allows for the building of knowledge on the complementarity of these methods. At the time of submission, we have completed qualitative and quantitative data collection for the telehealth evaluation. For the webinar series, so far, we have distributed the evaluation survey following three webinars and have conducted five attendee interviews. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the impact and sustainability of the proposed telehealth modalities is important. The results of the evaluation will provide data that can be actioned and serve to improve other telehealth modalities in the future, since health systems need this information to make decisions on resource allocation, especially in an uncertain pandemic climate. Evaluating the RAL and AB-SCILS to ensure their effectiveness demonstrates that Alberta Health Services and the health system care about ensuring the best practice even after a shift to primarily virtual care.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether HCQ administration is associated with improved mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data collected during the care process for COVID-19 positive patients discharged from facilities affiliated with a large healthcare system in the United States as of April 27, 2020. Patients were categorized by treatment with HCQ (in addition to standard supportive therapy) or receipt of supportive therapy with no HCQ. Patient outcomes were evaluated for in-hospital mortality. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were accounted for through a multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1669 patients were evaluated (no HCQ, n = 696; HCQ, n = 973). When adjusting for patient characteristics, receipt of AZM, and severity of disease at admission, there was no beneficial effect of receipt of HCQ on the risk of death. In this population, there was an 81% increase in the risk of mortality among patients who received HCQ at any time during their hospital stay versus no HCQ exposure (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.20–2.77, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis, we found that there was no benefit of administration of HCQ on mortality in COVID-19 patients. These results support recent changes to clinical trials that discourage the use of HCQ in COVID-19 patients.","Sands, Kenneth; Wenzel, Richard; McLean, Laura; Korwek, Kimberly; Roach, Jonathon; Miller, Karla; Poland, Russell E.; Burgess, L.

640387,Successful Treatment of Preterm Labor in Association with Acute COVID-19 Infection,2020-04-24,"INTRODUCTION: Over the past 20 years, the response to the HIV epidemic has achieved remarkable results. These results have often been motivated by targets adopted by countries through United Nations (UN) Political Declarations on HIV. The 2016 political declaration included two impact targets, to achieve a 75% decline in new HIV infections and AIDS‐related deaths between 2010 and 2020, and to reach the 90‐90‐90 testing and treatment targets by 2020. Our objective is to summarize progress towards these targets using robust and comparable HIV estimates released by UNAIDS in July 2021. In addition, we comment on the importance of targets and the modelled estimates required to quantify those targets. DISCUSSION: The UNAIDS estimates indicate that at the global and regional levels, the 2020 targets were missed: new infections declined by 31% and AIDS‐related deaths declined by 47% between 2010 and 2020, compared to a target of 75% decline for both indicators. Similarly, no region achieved the 90‐90‐90 testing and treatment targets. Some countries, in diverse settings, achieved these targets showing that the targets were not overly ambitious if the right funding, policies and evidence‐informed interventions at the right scale were in place. The 2021 UN Political Declaration on HIV, adopted on 8 June 2021, has set out a new set of ambitious but achievable targets for 2025. The 2025 targets and the required actions to reach those targets are described in the Global AIDS Strategy 2021–2026, which provides a framework to reprioritize HIV responses by reducing inequalities and building on the achievements of multiple Sustainable Development Goals. The Strategy encourages countries to monitor progress against targets for different geographic areas and populations to maximize equitable services and ensure accountability and also to understand why targets are being missed. CONCLUSIONS: The UNAIDS epidemiological estimates provide information that promote accountability and estimate progress towards global targets at the national level. Additional strategic information and analyses are required to identify the populations that are furthest from the targets and the programmes and policies that are keeping countries from meeting their targets.","Mahy, Mary I.; Sabin, Keith M.; Feizzadeh, Ali; Wanyeki, Ian",J Int AIDS Soc,https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34546655/,247

Various forms of facemasks, made using different materials, are being used extensively, and it is important to determine their performance characteristics. The size-dependent filtration efficiency and breathing resistance of household sterilization wrap fabrics, and isolation media (American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)- and non-ASTM-rated), were measured in filter-holder- and mannequin-in-chamber-based systems, focusing on particles sizes between 20 nm and 2 μm. Double-layer MERV-14 (Minimum Efficiency Reporting Values with rating 14) showed the highest filtration efficiency (94.9–73.3%) amongst household filter media, whereas ASTM-rated isolation masks showed the highest filtration efficiencies (95.6–88.7) amongst all the masks considered. Filtration efficiency of 3D-printed masks with replaceable filter media was found to depend on the degree of sealing around the media holder, which depended on the material’s compressibility. Filtration efficiencies of triple-layer combinations (95.8–85.3%) follow a profile similar to single layers but with improved filtration efficiencies.","Dhanraj, David I.

640976,COVID-19: a novel coronavirus and a novel challenge for oral healthcare,2020-05-07,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis, with no specific antiviral to treat the infection and the absence of a suitable vaccine to prevent it. While some individuals contracting the SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit a well coordinated immune response and recover, others display a dysfunctional immune response leading to serious complications including ARDS, sepsis, MOF; associated with morbidity and mortality. Studies revealed that in patients with a dysfunctional immune response, there is a massive cytokine and chemokine release, referred to as the ‘cytokine storm’. As a result, such patients exhibit higher levels of pro-inflammatory/modulatory cytokines and chemokines like TNFα, INFγ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, G-CSF, GM-CSF, MCSF, HGF and chemokines CXCL8, MCP1, IP10, MIP1α and MIP1β. Targeting this cytokine storm is a novel, promising treatment strategy to alleviate this excess influx of cytokines observed at the site of infection and their subsequent disastrous consequences. Natural immunosuppressant compounds, derived from plant sources like curcumin, luteolin, piperine, resveratrol are known to inhibit the production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This inhibitory effect is mediated by altering signal pathways like NF-κB, JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK that are involved in the production and release of cytokines and chemokines. The use of these natural immunosuppressants as adjuvants to ameliorate the cytokine storm; in combination with antiviral agents and other treatment drugs currently in use presents a novel, synergistic approach for the treatment and effective cure of COVID-19. This review briefly describes the immunopathogenesis of the cytokine storm observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection and details some natural immunosuppressants that can be used as adjuvants in treating COVID-19 disease.","Peter, Angela E.; Sandeep, B.

Such rapid spread is predominantly attributed to the poor diagnosis and its asymptomatic transmission. In the absence of treatment regime, timely diagnosis is the best available remedy that can restrict its spread. An early diagnosis of COVID‐19 is critical for determining the line of treatment and preventing long term complications in the infected subject. Unfortunately, available rapid antigen and antibody kits are known to be erroneous whereas reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction based tests are expensive, viral load dependent and at times inconclusive. In current scenario, the false‐negative results imposed a major risk to the individual patient care and also to the efforts for containing the spread at the population level, where as false positives are traumatic for families and can lead to improper treatment resulting in severe complications. In this article, the limitations of available diagnostic procedures have been elaborated and plausible combination approach has been advised.","Syal, Kirtimaan",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33200414/,247

641769,Panuveitis following Vaccination for COVID-19,2021,"Tremendous progress has been made to control the COVID-19 pandemic, including the development and approval of vaccines as well as the drug remdesivir, which inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. However, remdesivir confers only mild benefits to a subset of patients, and additional effective therapeutic options are needed. Drug repurposing and drug combinations may represent practical strategies to address these urgent unmet medical needs. Viruses, including coronaviruses, are known to hijack the host metabolism to facilitate their own proliferation, making targeting host metabolism a promising antiviral approach. Here, we describe an integrated analysis of 12 published in vitro and human patient gene expression datasets on SARS-CoV-2 infection using genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEM). We find that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce recurrent and complicated metabolic reprogramming spanning a wide range of metabolic pathways. We next applied the GEM-based metabolic transformation algorithm (MTA) to predict anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets that counteract the virus-induced metabolic changes. These predictions are enriched for validated targets from various published experimental drug and genetic screens. Further analyzing the RNA-sequencing data of remdesivir-treated Vero E6 cell samples that we generated, we predicted metabolic targets that act in combination with remdesivir. These predictions are enriched for previously reported synergistic drugs with remdesivir. Since our predictions are based in part on human patient data, they are likely to be clinically relevant. We provide our top high-confidence candidate targets for their evaluation in further studies, demonstrating host metabolism-targeting as a promising antiviral strategy.","Cheng, Kuoyuan; Riva, Laura; Sinha, Sanju; Pal, Lipika Ray; Nair, Nishanth Ulhas; Martin-Sancho, Laura; Chanda, Sumit K.; Ruppin, Eytan",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33532779/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.27.428543,247

From governmental installations to private companies and medical institutions, they all have to address directly with security issues as: access to restricted information quarantine control, or criminal tracking. As an example, identifying patients is critical in hospitals or geriatrics in order to isolate infected people, which has proven to be a non- trivial issue with the COVID-19 pandemic that is currently affecting all countries, or to locate fled patients. Face recognition is then a non-intrusive alternative for performing these tasks. Although FaceNet from Google has proved to be almost perfect, in a multi-face scenario its performance decays rapidly. In order to mitigate this loss of performance, in this paper a cluster based on the Neural Computer Stick version 2 and OpenVINO by Intel is proposed. A detailed power and runtime study is shown for two programming models, namely: multithreading and multiprocessing. Furthermore, 3 different hosts have been considered. In the most efficient configuration, an average of 6 frames per second has been achieved using the Raspberry Pi 4 as host and with a power consumption of just 11.2W, increasing by a factor of 3.3X the energy efficiency with respect to a PC-based solution in a multi-face scenario.","Mas, Juan; Panadero, Teodoro; Botella, Guillermo; Del Barrio, Alberto A.; García, Carlos",Comput Electr Eng,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0045790620307126; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compeleceng.2020.106859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33020673/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045790620307126,247

METHODS: A prospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted by including patients with CP hospitalized between January and June 2020 and a retrospective cohort of patients with IP hospitalized from 2009 to 2020. We compared the clinical presentations and studied the prognostic factors of CP and IP. RESULTS: Compared with the IP group (n=66), in the multivariate analysis, the CP group (n=362) had a lower percentage of patients with underlying asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p<0.01), lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p<0.01), lower systolic blood pressure (p<0.01), higher diastolic blood pressure (p<0.01), lower aspartate aminotransferase levels (p<0.05), higher serum sodium levels (p<0.05), and more frequent multilobar infiltrates (p<0.05). The diagnostic scoring system based on these findings showed excellent differentiation between CP and IP (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.889). Moreover, the prognostic predictors were different between CP and IP. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive differences between CP and IP were revealed, highlighting the need for early differentiation between these two pneumonias in clinical settings.","Oi, Issei; Ito, Isao; Hirabayashi, Masataka; Endo, Kazuo; Emura, Masahito; Kojima, Toru; Tsukao, Hitokazu; Tomii, Keisuke; Nakagawa, Atsushi; Otsuka, Kojiro; Akai, Masaya; Oi, Masahiro; Sugita, Takakazu; Fukui, Motonari; Inoue, Daiki; Hasegawa, Yoshinori; Takahashi, Kenichi; Yasui, Hiroaki; Fujita, Kohei; Ishida, Tadashi; Ito, Akihiro; Kita, Hideo; Kaji, Yusuke; Tsuchiya, Michiko; Tomioka, Hiromi; Yamada, Takashi; Terada, Satoru; Nakaji, Hitoshi; Hamao, Nobuyoshi; Shirata, Masahiro; Nishioka, Kensuke; Yamazoe, Masatoshi; Shiraishi, Yusuke; Ogimoto, Tatsuya; Hosoya, Kazutaka; Ajimizu, Hitomi; Shima, Hiroshi; Matsumoto, Hisako; Tanabe, Naoya; Hirai, Toyohiro",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34291119/,247
642345,"Asymptomatic Transmission, the Achilles’ Heel of Current Strategies to Control Covid-19",2020-04-24,"This paper is in response to the manuscript entitled “MOOCocracy: the learning culture of massive open online courses” (Loizzo and Ertmer in Educ Tech Res Dev 64:1013–1032, 2016, 10.1007/s11423-016-9444-7) from the perspectives of cognitive flexibility theory (CFT), in the context of pandemic-induced emergency remote teaching. Our response focuses on one of the questions raised in the call for this special issue on the latter topic: what are the implications of current, urgent work being done in digital learning for the future of online learning? We argue that much of what is important for a better future of online learning can also be done well now. However, building now with the future in mind involves a fundamental reorientation of the epistemic standpoint of online learning. The need for such a reframing is a tenet of CFT. Therefore, we use CFT as a lens to reflect on the proposal by Loizzo and Ertmer (Educ Tech Res Dev 64:1013–1032, 2016, 10.1007/s11423-016-9444-7) to combine c-MOOC and xMOOC designs to “foster a flexible, learner-centered culture” (p. 1027). Acknowledging the value of diverse perspectives afforded by the MOOCocracy culture, we also discuss how a CFT-based epistemic stance may further inform the future design and practice of MOOCs and, in a similar manner, online learning in general. We present some examples of ways application of learning and instruction principles of CFT can benefit online learning for the development of adaptive worldviews and the resultant development of adaptive skill that is becoming increasingly essential for life and work. Having this framework in mind as a principled overlay while urgently preparing for current schooling can help us build better, for now, and even more so for the needs that will remain in the longer term as education increasingly incorporates “twenty-first century skills.”","Hu, Ying; Spiro, Rand J.",Educ Technol Res Dev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-020-09920-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33456279/,247

The real statistics concealed behind the accessible data,2021-07-20,"BACKGROUND: South Asia has become a major epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding South Asians’ awareness, attitudes and experiences of early measures for the prevention of COVID-19 is key to improving the effectiveness and mitigating the social and economic impacts of pandemic responses at a critical time for the Region. METHODS: We assessed the knowledge, behaviours, health and socio-economic circumstances of 29,809 adult men and women, at 93 locations across four South Asian countries. Data were collected during the national lockdowns implemented from March to July 2020, and compared with data collected prior to the pandemic as part of an ongoing prospective surveillance initiative. RESULTS: Participants were 61% female, mean age 45.1 years. Almost half had one or more chronic disease, including diabetes (16%), hypertension (23%) or obesity (16%). Knowledge of the primary COVID-19 symptoms and transmission routes was high, but access to hygiene and personal protection resources was low (running water 63%, hand sanitisers 53%, paper tissues 48%). Key preventive measures were not widely adopted. Knowledge, access to, and uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures were low amongst people from disadvantaged socio-economic groups. Fifteen percent of people receiving treatment for chronic diseases reported loss of access to long-term medications; 40% reported symptoms suggestive of anxiety or depression. The prevalence of unemployment rose from 9.3% to 39.4% (P < 0.001), and household income fell by 52% (P < 0.001) during the lockdown. Younger people and those from less affluent socio-economic groups were most severely impacted. Sedentary time increased by 32% and inadequate fruit and vegetable intake increased by 10% (P < 0.001 for both), while tobacco and alcohol consumption dropped by 41% and 80%, respectively (P < 0.001), during the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identified important knowledge, access and uptake barriers to the prevention of COVID-19 in South Asia, and demonstrated major adverse impacts of the pandemic on chronic disease treatment, mental health, health-related behaviours, employment and household finances. We found important sociodemographic differences for impact, suggesting a widening of existing inequalities. Our findings underscore the need for immediate large-scale action to close gaps in knowledge and access to essential resources for prevention, along with measures to safeguard economic production and mitigate socio-economic impacts on the young and the poor.","Kusuma, Dian; Pradeepa, Rajendra; Khawaja, Khadija I.; Hasan, Mehedi; Siddiqui, Samreen; Mahmood, Sara; Ali Shah, Syed Mohsin; De Silva, Chamini K.; de Silva, Laksara; Gamage, Manoja; Loomba, Menka; Rajakaruna, Vindya P.; Hanif, Abu AM; Kamalesh, Rajan Babu; Kumarendran, Balachandran; Loh, Marie; Misra, Archa; Tassawar, Asma; Tyagi, Akansha; Waghdhare, Swati; Burney, Saira; Ahmad, Sajjad; Mohan, Viswanathan; Sarker, Malabika; Goon, Ian Y.; Kasturiratne, Anuradhani; Kooner, Jaspal S.; Katulanda, Prasad; Jha, Sujeet; Anjana, Ranjit Mohan; Mridha, Malay K.; Sassi, Franco; Chambers, John C.",SSM Popul Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33665333/,247

We systematically searched the MedLine, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CNKI, WanFang, medRxiv, and bioRxiv databases to identify studies that were published from the inception up to August 23, 2020, and reported the prevalence of PTSD after pandemics including sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, Poliomyelitis, Ebola, Zika, Nipah, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), H5N1, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A total of 88 studies were included in the analysis, with 77 having prevalence information and 70 having risk factors information. The overall pooled prevalence of post-pandemic PTSD across all populations was 22.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 19.9–25.4%, I(2): 99.7%). Healthcare workers had the highest prevalence of PTSD (26.9%; 95% CI: 20.3–33.6%), followed by infected cases (23.8%: 16.6–31.0%), and the general public (19.3%: 15.3–23.2%). However, the heterogeneity of study findings indicates that results should be interpreted cautiously. Risk factors including individual, family, and societal factors, pandemic-related factors, and specific factors in healthcare workers and patients for post-pandemic PTSD were summarized and discussed in this systematic review. Long-term monitoring and early interventions should be implemented to improve post-pandemic mental health and long-term recovery.","Yuan, Kai; Gong, Yi-Miao; Liu, Lin; Sun, Yan-Kun; Tian, Shan-Shan; Wang, Yi-Jie; Zhong, Yi; Zhang, An-Yi; Su, Si-Zhen; Liu, Xiao-Xing; Zhang, Yu-Xin; Lin, Xiao; Shi, Le; Yan, Wei; Fazel, Seena; Vitiello, Michael V.; Bryant, Richard A.; Zhou, Xin-Yu; Ran, Mao-Sheng; Bao, Yan-Ping; Shi, Jie; Lu, Lin",Mol Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01036-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33542468/,247

Probable SARS cases were defined by using the revised World Health Organization criteria. We systematically reviewed medical records and undertook descriptive statistical analyses. All 62 patients were hospitalized. On admission, the most prominent symptoms were malaise (82.3%) and fever (79.0%). Cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath were present in approximately one quarter of the patients; 79.0% had lymphopenia; 40.3% had thrombocytopenia; 19.4% had leukopenia; and 75.8% showed changes on chest radiograph. Fever developed on the first day of illness onset, and both respiratory symptoms and radiographic changes occurred on day 4. On average, maximal radiographic changes were observed on day 10, and fevers subsided by day 13. Symptoms on admission were nonspecific, although fever, malaise, and lymphopenia were common.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine the association of basal metabolic index (body mass index (BMI)) with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), dialysis, upgrade to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality. Independent t-test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to calculate mean differences and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with its 95% confidence interval (CI), respectively. RESULTS: A total of 176 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were included. The mean age was 62.2 years, with 51% being male patients. The mean BMI for non-surviving patients was significantly higher compared to patients surviving on the seventh day of hospitalization (35 vs. 30 kg/m(2), P = 0.022). Similarly, patients requiring IMV had a higher BMI (33 vs. 29, P = 0.002) compared to non-intubated patients. The unadjusted OR for patients with a higher BMI requiring IMV (56% vs. 28%, OR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.6 - 7.0, P = 0.002) and upgrade to ICU (46% vs. 28%, OR; 2.2, 1.07 - 4.6, P = 0.04) were significantly higher compared to patients with a lower BMI. Similarly, patients with a higher BMI had higher in-hospital mortality (21% vs. 9%, OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.3 - 8.2, P = 0.01) compared to patients with a normal BMI. Despite a numerical advantage in the lower BMI group, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the need for dialysis (5% vs. 13%, OR: 3.8, 13% vs. 4%, 1.1 - 14.1, P = 0.07). aORs controlled for baseline comorbidities and medications mirrored the overall results, except for the need to upgrade to ICU. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with confirmed COVID-19, morbid obesity serves as an independent risk factor of high in-hospital mortality and the need for IMV.","Ullah, Waqas; Roomi, Sohaib; Nadeem, Nayab; Saeed, Rehan; Tariq, Shafaq; Ellithi, Moataz; Haq, Shujaul; Arslan, Ahmad; Madara, John; Boigon, Margot; Haas, Donald C.; Fischman, David L.",J Clin Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007361/; https://doi.org/10.14740/jocmr4239,247

However, due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, interest in orthopedics in these procedures has increased significantly. The aim of this systematic review was to find out to what extent there is scientific evidence for the use of telemedicine in the orthopedic field. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in various databases on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on telemedical applications in orthopedics. RESULTS: Altogether, 14 articles were identified that reported about a total of eight RCTs of telemedical applications in orthopedics. Two RCTs were about a patient-to-doctor video consultation and six RCTs were about telerehabilitation after knee and hip arthroplasty (4 × knee arthroplasty, one hip and knee arthroplasty, one hip arthroplasty). For the majority of outcome parameters evaluated, there were no significant differences between the study groups. The cost effectiveness of videoconsultations depended on the workload (number of patient consultations) as well as the effectiveness of telerehabilitation on the distance of the patient's home to the health care center (30 km round-trip). CONCLUSION: There is sufficient evidence to recommend the use of telemedical methods in orthopedics. However, more research is necessary to further expand the possibilities of telemedical methods with regard to physical examination.","Petersen, Wolf; Karpinski, Katrin; Backhaus, Luisa; Bierke, Sebastian; Häner, Martin",Arch Orthop Trauma Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-021-03788-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33635399/,247

DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal feasibility and reliability study. METHODS: Twenty adults (median 71 years) with an established diagnosis of glaucoma were issued a tablet-perimeter (Eyecatcher), and were asked to perform one VF home-assessment per eye, per month, for 6 months (12 tests total). Before and after home-monitoring, two VF assessments were performed in-clinic using Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP; 4 tests total, per eye). RESULTS: All 20 participants could perform monthly home-monitoring, though one participant stopped after 4 months (Adherence: 98%). There was good concordance between VFs measured at home and in the clinic (r = 0.94, P < 0.001). In 21 of 236 tests (9%) Mean Deviation deviated by more than ±3 dB from the median. Many of these anomalous tests could be identified by applying machine learning techniques to recordings from the tablets’ front-facing camera (Area Under the ROC Curve = 0.78). Adding home-monitoring data to 2 SAP tests made 6 months apart reduced measurement error (between-test measurement variability) in 97% of eyes, with mean absolute error more than halving in 90% of eyes. Median test duration was 4.5 mins (Quartiles: 3.9 – 5.2 mins). Substantial variations in ambient illumination had no observable effect on VF measurements (r = 0.07, P = 0.320). CONCLUSIONS: Home-monitoring of VFs is viable for some patients, and may provide clinically useful data.","Jones, Pete R.; Campbell, Peter; Callaghan, Tamsin; Jones, Lee; Asfaw, Daniel S.; Edgar, David F.; Crabb, David P.",Am J Ophthalmol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002939420304682; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002939420304682?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2020.08.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32882222/,247

The present study examined the circulatory levels of a wide panel of trace elements (Al, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Cd, Pb, and U) in hemodialysis patients (HD group) and pre-dialysis patients with stage 3 CKD (PD group). Comparisons were made between groups of patients and healthy individuals from the control group (CG). The levels of Al, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, As, Se, Sr, and Pb were higher, while the levels of Cr, Zn, Rb, Cd, and U were lower in HD patients than in our CG. Higher levels of Al and Se, as well as lower levels of As, Sr, Zn, Rb, and U were significant and distinguished HD from PD. Among other analyzed elements, Co, Se, and U are the only trace elements that did not distinguish PD from CG at a statistically significant level. The HD group had lower serum U levels than the PD group, and this could be a result of hemodialysis. This study also revealed that the Cu/Zn ratio could be used as a marker for early and late detection of renal failure. Marked changes of essential and toxic trace element levels in sera indicate additional pathophysiological events in CKD, which could additionally contribute to the preexisting increased morbidity of HD patients. Measurement of trace elements in HD patients should be performed routinely.

Using FluNet records for 29 Pan-American countries from 2005 to 2019, we explored whether completeness was associated with health expenditure indicators adjusting for surveillance system heterogeneity. We observed steady improvements in completeness by 4.2–6.3% annually, especially after the A(H1N1)-2009 pandemic, when 24 countries reached > 95% completeness. Doubling in decadal health expenditure per capita was associated with ~ 7% increase in overall completeness.

To date, a myriad of Ab tests, both available and authorized for emergency use by the FDA, has led to confusion rather than insight per se. The present study reports the results of a rapid, point-in-time 1,000-person cohort study using serial blood donors in the New York City metropolitan area (NYC) using multiple serological tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and high throughput serological assays (HTSAs). These were then tested and associated with assays for neutralizing Ab (NAb). Of the 1,000 NYC blood donor samples in late June and early July 2020, 12.1% and 10.9% were seropositive using the Ortho Total Ig and the Abbott IgG HTSA assays, respectively. These serological assays correlated with neutralization activity specific to SARS-CoV-2. The data reported herein suggest that seroconversion in this population occurred in approximately 1 in 8 blood donors from the beginning of the pandemic in NYC (considered March 1, 2020). These findings deviate with an earlier seroprevalence study in NYC showing 13.7% positivity. Collectively however, these data demonstrate that a low number of individuals have serologic evidence of infection during this first wave and suggest that the notion of herd immunity at rates of ~60% or higher are not near. Furthermore, the data presented herein show that the nature of the Ab-based immunity is not invariably associated with the development of NAb. While the blood donor population may not mimic precisely the NYC population as a whole, rapid assessment of seroprevalence in this cohort and serial reassessment could aid public health decision making.","Jin, D.

NAB is a 116-residue α/β protein, which contains 9 prolines and has 50% of its residues located in loops and turns. Overall, the results presented here show that sizeable nearest-neighbor effects are seen only for residues preceding proline, where Pro introduces an overestimation, on average, of 1.73 ppm in the computed (13)C(α) chemical shifts. A new ensemble of 20 conformers representing the NMR structure of the NAB, which was calculated with an input containing backbone torsion angle constraints derived from the theoretical (13)C(α) chemical shifts as supplementary data to the NOE distance constraints, exhibits very similar topology and comparable agreement with the NOE constraints as the published NMR structure. However, the two structures differ in the patterns of differences between observed and computed (13)C(α) chemical shifts, Δ(ca,i), for the individual residues along the sequence. This indicates that the Δ(ca,i) -values for the NAB protein are primarily a consequence of the limited sampling by the bundles of 20 conformers used, as in common practice, to represent the two NMR structures, rather than of local flaws in the structures.","Vila, Jorge A.; Serrano, Pedro; Wüthrich, Kurt; Scheraga, Harold A.",J Biomol NMR,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20644980/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10858-010-9435-7,247

Anticipating a need for such therapies during the pandemic, our center created a targeted protocol for ECMO therapy in COVID-19 patients that allows us to provide this life-saving therapy to our sickest patients without overburdening already stretched resources or excessively exposing healthcare staff to infection risk. METHODS: As a major regional referral program, we used the framework of our well-established ECMO service-line to outline specific team structures, modified patient eligibility criteria, cannulation strategies, and management protocols for the COVID-19 ECMO program. RESULTS: During the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak in Massachusetts, 6 patients were placed on VV ECMO for refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure. The median (interquartile range) age was 47 years (43–53) with most patients being male (83%) and obese (67%). All cannulations were performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit in patients who had undergone a trial of rescue therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome including lung protective ventilation, paralysis, prone positioning, and inhaled nitric oxide. At the time of this report, 83% (5/6) of the patients are still alive with 1 death on ECMO, attributed to hemorrhagic stroke. 67% of patients (4/6) have been successfully decannulated, including 2 that have been successfully extubated and one who was discharged from the hospital. The median duration of VV ECMO therapy for patients who have been decannulated is 12 days (4–18 days). CONCLUSIONS: This is 1 the first case series describing VV ECMO outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

This study aimed to prospectively investigate the association between mushroom consumption and all-cause and cause-specific mortality risk. METHODS: Longitudinal analyses of participants from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) extant data (1988–1994). Mushroom intake was assessed by a single 24-h dietary recall using the US Department of Agriculture food codes for recipe foods. All-cause and cause-specific mortality were assessed in all participants linked to the National Death Index mortality data (1988–2015). We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to calculate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: Among 15,546 participants included in the current analysis, the mean (SE) age was 44.3 (0.5) years. During a mean (SD) follow-up duration of 19.5 (7.4) years , a total of 5826 deaths were documented. Participants who reported consuming mushrooms had lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with those without mushroom intake (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.73–0.98) after adjusting for demographic, major lifestyle factors, overall diet quality, and other dietary factors including total energy. When cause-specific mortality was examined, we did not observe any statistically significant associations with mushroom consumption. Consuming 1-serving of mushrooms per day instead of 1-serving of processed or red meats was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.50–0.84). We also observed a dose-response relationship between higher mushroom consumption and lower risk of all-cause mortality (P-trend = 0.03).

As a result, there is a need for data-driven approaches to pinpoint the unique constellation of clinical and social determinants of health (SDOH) risk factors that give rise to poor patient outcomes following infection in US communities. METHODS: We combined county-level COVID-19 testing data, COVID-19 vaccination rates and SDOH information in Tennessee. Between February and May 2021, we trained machine learning models on a semimonthly basis using these datasets to predict COVID-19 incidence in Tennessee counties. We then analyzed SDOH data features at each time point to rank the impact of each feature on model performance. RESULTS: Our results indicate that COVID-19 vaccination rates play a crucial role in determining future COVID-19 disease risk. Beginning in mid-March 2021, higher vaccination rates significantly correlated with lower COVID-19 case growth predictions. Further, as the relative importance of COVID-19 vaccination data features grew, demographic SDOH features such as age, race and ethnicity decreased while the impact of socioeconomic and environmental factors, including access to healthcare and transportation, increased. CONCLUSION: Incorporating a data framework to track the evolving patterns of community-level SDOH risk factors could provide policy-makers with additional data resources to improve health equity and resilience to future public health emergencies.","Wylezinski, Lukasz S; Harris, Coleman R; Heiser, Cody N; Gray, Jamieson D; Spurlock, Charles F",BMJ Health Care Inform,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjhci-2021-100439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580088/,247

We aimed to study the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal volume (V(T)) on the distributions of regional ventilation and perfusion by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in healthy and injured lungs. METHODS: One-hit acute lung injury model was established in 6 piglets by repeated lung lavages (injured group). Four ventilated piglets served as the control group. A randomized sequence of any possible combination of three V(T) (7, 10, and 15 ml/kg) and four levels of PEEP (5, 8, 10, and 12 cmH(2)O) was performed in all animals. Ventilation and perfusion distributions were computed by EIT within three regions-of-interest (ROIs): nondependent, middle, dependent. A mixed design with one between-subjects factor (group: intervention or control), and two within-subjects factors (PEEP and V(T)) was used, with a three-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Two-way interactions between PEEP and group, and V(T) and group, were observed for the dependent ROI (p = 0.035 and 0.012, respectively), indicating that the increase in the dependent ROI ventilation was greater at higher PEEP and V(T) in the injured group than in the control group. A two-way interaction between PEEP and V(T) was observed for perfusion distribution in each ROI: nondependent (p = 0.030), middle (p = 0.006), and dependent (p = 0.001); no interaction was observed between injured and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Large PEEP and V(T) levels were associated with greater pulmonary ventilation of the dependent lung region in experimental lung injury, whereas they affected pulmonary perfusion of all lung regions both in the control and in the experimental lung injury groups.","Borges, João Batista; Cronin, John N.; Crockett, Douglas C.; Hedenstierna, Göran; Larsson, Anders; Formenti, Federico",Intensive Care Med Exp,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40635-020-0298-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32086632/,247

Those with existing comorbidities and minority ethnic groups have been found to be at increased risk of mortality. We wished to determine if there were any differences in intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 30-day hospital mortality in a city with high levels of deprivation and a large community of people of South Asian heritage. Methods: Detailed information on 582 COVID-19-positive inpatients in Bradford and Calderdale between February-August 2020 were extracted from Electronic Health Records. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the relationship between ethnicity with admission to ICU and 30-day mortality, respectively accounting for the effect of demographic and clinical confounders. Results: The sample consisted of 408 (70%) White, 142 (24%) South Asian and 32 (6%) other minority ethnic patients. Ethnic minority patients were younger, more likely to live in deprived areas, and be overweight/obese, have type 2 diabetes, hypertension and asthma compared to white patients, but were less likely to have cancer (South Asian patients only) and COPD. Male and obese patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU, and patients of South Asian ethnicity, older age, and those with cancer were less likely. Being male, older age, deprivation, obesity, and cancer were associated with 30-day mortality. The risk of death in South Asian patients was the same as in white patients HR 1.03 (0.58, 1.82). Conclusions: Despite South Asian patients being less likely to be admitted to ICU and having a higher prevalence of diabetes and obesity, there was no difference in the risk of death compared to white patients. This contrasts with other findings and highlights the value of studies of communities which may have different ethnic, deprivation and clinical risk profiles.","Santorelli, Gillian; McCooe, Michael; Sheldon, Trevor A.; Wright, John; Lawton, Tom",Wellcome Open Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16580.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522788/,247

Our goal was to conduct a molecular epidemiologic study to detect the presence of HRSV and HMPV in fecal samples from wild human-habituated free-ranging mountain gorillas in Rwanda and to evaluate the role of these viruses in RI outbreaks. Fecal samples were collected from gorillas with clinical signs of RI between June 2012 and February 2013 and tested by real-time and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays; comparison fecal samples were obtained from gorillas without clinical signs of RI sampled during the 2010 Virunga gorilla population census. PCR assays detected HMPV and HRSV first in spiked samples; subsequently, HRSV-A, the worldwide-circulating ON1 genotype, was detected in 12 of 20 mountain gorilla fecal samples collected from gorillas with RI during outbreaks, but not in samples from animals without respiratory illness. Our findings confirmed that pathogenic human respiratory viruses are transmitted to gorillas and that they are repeatedly introduced into mountain gorilla populations from people, attesting to the need for stringent biosecurity measures for the protection of gorilla health.","Mazet, Jonna A.

In the UK, these challenges have included the fact that mortality has adversely affected minority communities. Corpse disposal and social distancing guidelines do not allow a process of mourning in which families and communities can be involved in the dying process. This study aimed to examine the main concerns of faith and non-faith communities across the UK in relation to death in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research team used rapid ethnographic methods to examine the adaptations to the dying process prior to hospital admission, during admission, during the disposal and release of the body, during funerals and mourning. The study revealed that communities were experiencing collective loss, were making necessary adaptations to rituals that surrounded death, dying and mourning and would benefit from clear and compassionate communication and consultation with authorities.","Simpson, Nikita; Angland, Michael; Bhogal, Jaskiran K; Bowers, Rebecca E; Cannell, Fenella; Gardner, Katy; Gheewala Lohiya, Anishka; James, Deborah; Jivraj, Naseem; Koch, Insa; Laws, Megan; Lipton, Jonah; Long, Nicholas J; Vieira, Jordan; Watt, Connor; Whittle, Catherine; Zidaru-Bărbulescu, Teodor; Bear, Laura",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34078630/,247

This opportunistic fungal infection causes angioinvasion and ischemic tissue necrosis. It mainly affects immunocompromised patients. Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, many case reports have described the rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis associated with COVID-19. However, the underlying predisposing factors are unknown. Several factors, other than diabetes, which is the most well-known contributing factor, may be involved in causing this severe fungal infection in COVID-19 patients. These factors may include steroid therapy, which is being used in severely dyspneic patients, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that may cause fungal flare-ups, and hospitalization with possible nosocomial infections. In addition, increased serum ferritin levels, possible endothelial damage, and pancreatic islets affection among COVID-19 patients may be implicated. Head and neck surgeons should be aware of the increasing prevalence of craniofacial mucormycosis among COVID-19 patients, as early diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential to improve the outcomes.","Abdel-Aziz, Mosaad; Azab, Noha",J. craniofac. surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34560756/; https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000008231,247

Neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection in mice provides a useful tool for studying mechanisms of demyelination in a virus-induced experimental model of MS. This study uses Affymetrix microarray analysis to compare differential spinal cord mRNA levels between mice infected with demyelinating and non-demyelinating strains of MHV to identify host immune genes expressed in this demyelinating disease model. The study reveals that during the acute stage of infection, both strains induce inflammatory innate immune response genes, whereas upregulation of several immunoglobulin genes during chronic stage infection is unique to infection with the demyelinating strain. Results suggest that the demyelinating strain induced an innate-immune response during acute infection that may promote switching of Ig isotype genes during chronic infection, potentially playing a role in antibody-mediated progressive demyelination even after viral clearance.","Biswas, Kaushiki; Chatterjee, Dhriti; Addya, Sankar; Khan, Reas S.; Kenyon, Lawrence C.; Choe, Alexander; Cohrs, Randall J.; Shindler, Kenneth S.; Das Sarma, Jayasri",Clin Immunol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521661616301589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27394164/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1521661616301589; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2016.07.004,247
653056,The COVID-19 Infection in Italy: A Statistical Study of an Abnormally Severe Disease,2020-05-21,"Although some previously common infections, such as Sendai virus and Mycoplasma pulmonis, have become rare in laboratory rodents in North American research facilities, others continue to plague researchers and those responsible for providing biomedical scientists with animals free of adventitious disease. Long-recognized agents that remain in research facilities in the 21(st) century include parvoviruses of rats and mice, mouse rotavirus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and pinworms. The reasons for their persistence vary with the agent. The resilience of parvoviruses, for example, is due to their resistance to inactivation, their prolonged shedding, and difficulties with detection, especially in C57BL/6 mice. Rotavirus also has marked environmental resistance, but periodic reintroduction into facilities, possibly on bags of feed, bedding, or other supplies or equipment, also seems likely. TMEV is characterized by resistance to inactivation, periodic reintroduction, and relatively long shedding periods. Although MHV remains active in the environment at most a few days, currently prevalent strains are shed in massive quantities and likely transmitted by fomites. Pinworm infestations continue because of prolonged infections, inefficient diagnosis, and the survivability of eggs of some species in the environment. For all of these agents, increases in both interinstitutional shipping and the use of immunodeficient or genetically modified rodents of unknown immune status may contribute to the problem, as might incursions by wild or feral rodents. Elimination of these old enemies will require improved detection, strict adherence to protocols designed to limit the spread of infections, and comprehensive eradication programs.","Clifford, Charles B.; Watson, Julie",ILAR J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18506062/,247

Because N‐glycans are directly involved in the docking of viruses to host cells, recognition of GlcNAc(2) by a biomimetic receptor may be a convenient alternative to the use of lectins to interfere with viral entry and infection. Herein, we describe a simple biomimetic receptor recognizing the methyl‐β‐glycoside of GlcNAc(2) in water with an unprecedented affinity of 160 μM, exceeding that of more structurally complex receptors reported in the literature. The tweezers‐shaped acyclic structure exhibits marked selectivity among structurally related disaccharides, and complete discrimination between mono‐ and disaccharides.

653569,Value of nurse navigators (NNs) telemonitoring for cancer patients (pts) tested positive for COVID-19,2020-09-30,"BACKGROUND: While COVID-19 vaccine uptake has been encouraging overall, some individuals are either hesitant towards, or refuse, the vaccine. Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) has been applied to influenza vaccine acceptance, but there is a lack of research applying PMT to COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Additionally, prior research has suggested that coronavirus conspiracy beliefs and demographic factors may play a role in attitudes towards the vaccine. This study aimed to predict COVID-19 vaccination intention using PMT, coronavirus conspiracy beliefs, and demographic factors. Furthermore, vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were compared in relation to their coronavirus conspiracy beliefs. METHODS: An online survey was administered to 382 (278 vaccinated, and 104 unvaccinated) individuals in the United Kingdom (77 males, 301 females, one non-binary/third gender, and three unstated). Respondents’ mean age was 43.78 (SD = 12.58). RESULTS: A hierarchical multiple linear regression was performed in three stages. Initially, four PMT constructs - severity, susceptibility, maladaptive response costs, and self-efficacy - emerged as significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccination intention. The final model accounted for 75% of the variance and retained two significant predictors from PMT - maladaptive response rewards and self-efficacy - alongside coronavirus conspiracy beliefs and age. An independent t-test established that unvaccinated individuals held greater coronavirus conspiracy beliefs than vaccinated ones. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions and campaigns addressing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance should employ strategies increasing individuals’ perceived severity of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility, and perceived ability to get vaccinated, while decreasing perceived rewards of not getting vaccinated. Additionally, coronavirus conspiracy beliefs should be addressed, as these appear to play a role for some vaccine-hesitant individuals.","Eberhardt, Judith; Ling, Jonathan",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21011890?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.09.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21011890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34535313/,247

Continuous injections needed in some cases are an economic burden for patients/healthcare system, so real-life clinical practice tends to adopt a reactive approach, ie, watch and wait for worsening symptoms, which consequently increases the risk of undertreatment and edema recurrence. On March 7th 2019, a group of experts in retinal medicine and surgery held a roundtable meeting in Madrid, Spain to discuss how to (1) optimize clinical outcomes through earlier use of fluocinolone acetonide (FAc) implant (ILUVIEN(®)) in patients with persistent or recurrent DME despite therapy; and, (2) to provide guidance to assist physicians in deciding which patients should be treated with ILUVIEN. In this regard, a 36-month follow-up consensus protocol is presented. In conclusion, patients that achieve a complete or partial anatomical, and preferably functional, response following one or two intravitreal dexamethasone implants, but with recurrence of edema after 3–4 months, are deemed by the authors most likely to benefit from ILUVIEN, and the switch to FAc implant should not be delayed more than 12 months after the initiation of at least the first dexamethasone implant.","Adán, Alfredo; Cabrera, Francisco; Figueroa, Marta S; Cervera, Enrique; Ascaso, Francisco J; Udaondo, Patricia; Abraldes, Maximino; Reyes, Miguel Ángel; Pazos, Marta; Pessoa, Bernardete; Armadá, Félix",Clin Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.2147/opth.s252359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32801618/,247

However, the molecular characteristics and pathological features underlying COVID-19 pneumonia remain largely unknown. To characterize molecular mechanisms underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis in the lung tissue using a proteomic approach, fresh lung tissues were obtained from newly deceased patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. After virus inactivation, a quantitative proteomic approach combined with bioinformatics analysis was used to detect proteomic changes in the SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues. We identified significant differentially expressed proteins involved in a variety of fundamental biological processes including cellular metabolism, blood coagulation, immune response, angiogenesis, and cell microenvironment regulation. Several inflammatory factors were upregulated, which was possibly caused by the activation of NF-κB signaling. Extensive dysregulation of the lung proteome in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection was discovered.

However, the number of samples used in each individual study typically is small, moreover the technologies and protocols used in different studies vary, thus somewhat restricting the range of conclusions that can be made with high confidence. To better capture the cellular gene expression changes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection at different levels and stages of disease severity and to minimise the effect of technical artefacts, we performed meta-analysis of data from 9 previously published studies, together comprising 143 human samples, and a set of 16 healthy control samples (10X). In particular, we used generally accepted immune cell markers to discern specific cell subtypes and to look at the changes of the cell proportion over different disease stages and their consistency across the studies. While half of the observations reported in the individual studies can be confirmed across multiple studies, half of the results seem to be less conclusive. In particular, we show that the differentially expressed genes consistently point to upregulation of type I Interferon signal pathway and downregulation of the mitochondrial genes, alongside several other reproducibly consistent changes. We also confirm the presence of expanded B-cell clones in COVID-19 patients, however, no consistent trend in T-cell clonal expansion was observed.","Garg, Manik; Li, Xu; Moreno, Pablo; Papatheodorou, Irene; Shu, Yuelong; Brazma, Alvis; Miao, Zhichao",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.24.427089,247

Massage is expected to improve the blood flow and, consequently, vascular function. The aim of this study was to determine the short-term and long-term effects of periocular massage on OBF and visual acuity. METHODS: The OBF and visual acuity were measured in 40 healthy adults aged 20–30 years before and after massage, and also in control subjects. Three massage methods were used: applying periocular acupressure (“Chinese eye exercise”: CE), using a facial massage roller (MR), and using an automated eye massager (AM). The OBF and visual acuity were first measured before and after applying each type of massage for 5 min. Eye massage was then applied for 5 min once daily over a 60-day period, while the control group received no massage. The same measurements were then performed again. RESULTS: Performing short-term periocular massage showed significant interactions in time and massage effects on visual acuity in CE and AM groups, and on OBF in AM group, while 60-day massage period exerted no significant effects. No significant relationship was found between OBF and visual acuity changes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that short-term periocular massage with Chinese eye exercise and automated eye massager can improve OBF and visual acuity, although no causal relationship was supported.","Hayashi, Naoyuki; Du, Lanfei",Int J Ther Massage Bodywork,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079599/,247

Network analysis can provide a useful method for evaluating and comparing these symptom structures. The present study includes 7034 participants from 86 countries who reported on mental health symptoms associated with either a COVID-19-related PTE (n= 1838) or other PTE (n= 5196). Using network analysis, we compared the centrality and connections of symptoms within and between each group. Overall, results show that the COVID-19-related network includes transdiagnostic symptom associations similar to networks tied to PTEs unrelated to the pandemic. Findings provide evidence for a shared centrality of depression across networks and theoretically consistent connections between symptoms. Network differences included stronger connections between avoidance-derealization and hypervigilance-depression in the COVID-19 network. Present findings support the conceptualization of psychological responses to pandemic-related PTEs as a network of highly interconnected symptoms and support the use of a transdiagnostic approach to the assessment and treatment of mental health challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is frequently assumed that digital technologies can supplement and perhaps even replace services for families. This is challenging in conditions of high device and data costs as well as poor internet provision and access, raising concerns about widening inequalities in availability of support and consequent effects on child and family outcomes. Very few studies have examined these issues, including in low- and middle-income countries. OBJECTIVE: The study objectives were two-fold. The first objective was to gather data on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families of young children using an online survey. The second objective was to assess the feasibility of using a data-free online platform to conduct regular surveys and, potentially, to provide support for parents and families of young children in South Africa. METHODS: We used a data-free mobile messenger platform to conduct a short digital survey of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on caring for young children in South Africa. We report on the methodological processes and preliminary findings of the online survey. RESULTS: More than 44,000 individuals accessed the survey link and 16,217 consented to the short survey within 96 hours of its launch. Respondents were predominantly from lower classes and lower-middle classes, representing the majority of the population, with urban residential locations roughly proportionate to national patterns and some underrepresentation of rural households. Mothers comprised 70.2% (11,178/15,912) of respondents and fathers comprised 29.8% (4734/15,912), representing 18,672 children 5 years of age and younger. Response rates per survey item ranged from 74.8% (11,907/15,912) at the start of the survey to 50.3% (8007/15,912) at completion. A total of 82.0% (12,729/15,912) of parents experienced at least one challenge during the pandemic, and 32.4% (2737/8441) did not receive help when needed from listed sources. Aggregate and individual findings in the form of bar graphs were made available to participants to view and download once they had completed the survey. Participants were also able to download contact details for support and referral services at no data cost. CONCLUSIONS: Data-free survey methodology breaks new ground and demonstrates potential not previously considered. Reach is greater than achieved through phone surveys and some social media platforms, men are not usually included in parent surveys, costs are lower than phone surveys, and the technology allows for immediate feedback to respondents. These factors suggest that zero-rated, or no-cost, services could provide a feasible, sustainable, and equitable basis for ongoing interactions with families of young children.","Richter, Linda Marleine; Naicker, Sara Naomi",JMIR Pediatr Parent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852414/; https://doi.org/10.2196/26571,247
656770,Association of Prior Radiation Dose to the Cardiopulmonary System with COVID-19 Outcomes in Patients with Cancer,2021-06-06,"BACKGROUND: Widespread social distancing and lockdowns of everyday activity have been the primary policy prescription across many countries throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite their uniformity, these measures may be differentially valuable for different countries. METHODS: We use a compartmental epidemiological model to project the spread of COVID-19 across policy scenarios in high- and low-income countries. We embed estimates of the welfare value of disease avoidance into the epidemiological projections to estimate the return to more stringent lockdown policies. RESULTS: Social distancing measures that ‘flatten the curve’ of the disease provide immense welfare value in upper-income countries. However, social distancing policies deliver significantly less value in lower-income countries that have younger populations, which are less vulnerable to COVID-19. Equally important, social distancing mandates a trade-off between disease risk and economic activity. Poorer people are less able to make those economic sacrifices. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological and welfare value of social distancing is smaller in lower-income countries and such policies may exact a heavy toll on the poorest and most vulnerable. Workers in the informal sector often lack the resources and social protections that enable them to isolate themselves until the virus passes. By limiting these households’ ability to earn a living, social distancing can lead to an increase in hunger, deprivation, and related mortality and morbidity.","Barnett-Howell, Zachary; Watson, Oliver John; Mobarak, Ahmed Mushfiq",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04867v1.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/traa140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33440007/,247
656866,Ozone therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia: a scoping review,2020-12-21,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether vitamin A deficiency alters the recovery of total respiratory resistance (TRR) following acute upper respiratory tract infection (URI). METHODS: This is a case control study of children, age 4–6 years and grouped as: URI, (n = 74), URI and wheezing, (URI‐wheezing, n = 52), and healthy controls (n = 51). Vitamin A and total respiratory resistance (TRR) were assessed using the modified relative dose response (MRDR) and forced oscillometry, respectively. RESULTS: Children with URI and URI‐wheezing had lower retinol, 32.4 ± 13.12 and 18.3 ± 6.83 µg/dl respectively, compared to controls, 56.9 ± 29.82 µg/dl (ANOVA, P < 0.001). The MRDR was elevated in children in the URI or URI‐wheezing groups 0.066 ± 0.045 and 0.021 ± 0.021, respectively, compared to controls 0.007 ± 0.006 (ANOVA, P < 0.0001). The TRR in the URI and URI‐wheezing groups differed from controls. During convalescence, the TRR failed to decline in the URI‐group only when the MRDR was >0.06. In the URI‐wheezing group, TRR declined independently of retinol and MRDR. CONCLUSION: Vitamin A contributes to preservation of airway function during and in recovery after upper respiratory infection in children.

657350,Longitudinal Characterization of the IgM and IgG Humoral Response in Symptomatic COVID-19 Patients Using Abbott Architect,2020-10-27,"Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems have become an ideal choice for pathway prototyping, protein production, and biosensing, due to their high controllability, tolerance, stability, and ability to produce proteins in a short time. At present, the widely used CFPS systems are mainly based on Escherichia coli strain. Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamate, and Vibrio natriegens are potential chassis cells for many biotechnological applications with their respective characteristics. Therefore, to expand the platform of the CFPS systems and options for protein production, four prokaryotes, E. coli, B. subtilis, C. glutamate, and V. natriegens were selected as host organisms to construct the CFPS systems and be compared. Moreover, the process parameters of the CFPS system were optimized, including the codon usage, plasmid synthesis competent cell selection, plasmid concentration, ribosomal binding site (RBS), and CFPS system reagent components. By optimizing and comparing the main influencing factors of different CFPS systems, the systems can be optimized directly for the most influential factors to further improve the protein yield of the systems. In addition, to demonstrate the applicability of the CFPS systems, it was proved that the four CFPS systems all had the potential to produce therapeutic proteins, and they could produce the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS-CoV-2 with functional activity. They not only could expand the potential options for in vitro protein production, but also could increase the application range of the system by expanding the cell-free protein synthesis platform.

However, they fail to consider the part of contractualism that Scanlon constructed precisely to deal with the question of when the state can restrict individuals from making choices that are harmful to themselves and others: the value of choice view (VoC). In doing so, they leave it open for opponents of lockdowns to misuse contractualism to justify mistaken policies. This is because the most powerful contractualist objections to locking down are likely to be based on the VoC.When we apply the value of choice view (VoC), we see that a lockdown policy's justifiability depends on the extent to which particular values of choice are found to be threatened by the policy in question, and what safeguards policy-makers have put in place to increase the value of choice and protect people from the harmful consequences of lockdown. Without the VoC, it is harder to explain why lockdowns, to be non-rejectable, must have certain features. With the VoC, the case for contractualism over cost benefit analysis (CBA) can be made even stronger.","Kugelberg, Elsa",Journal of medical ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34321353/; https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107635,247

658392,Complications Following Self-Administration of Hyaluronic Acid Fillers: Literature Review,2020-10-14,"Infectious disease severely threatens human life. Human mobility and travel patterns influence the spread of infection between cities and countries. We find that the infection severity in downstream cities during outbreaks is related to transmission rate, recovery rate, travel rate, travel duration and the average number of person-to-person contacts per day. The peak value of the infected population in downstream cities is slightly higher than that in source cities. However, as the number of cities increases, the severity increase percentage during outbreaks between end and source cities is constant. The surveillance of important nodes connecting cities, such as airports and train stations, can help delay the occurrence time of infection outbreaks. The city-entry surveillance of hub cities is not only useful to these cities, but also to cities that are strongly connected (i.e., have a high travel rate) to them. The city-exit surveillance of hub cities contributes to other downstream cities, but only slightly to itself. Surveillance conducted in hub cities is highly efficient in controlling infection transmission. Only strengthening the individual immunity of frequent travellers is not efficient for infection control. However, reducing the number of person-to-person contacts per day effectively limits the spread of infection.","Zhang, Nan; Zhao, Pengcheng; Li, Yuguo",J Theor Biol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.03.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30851275/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519319300979; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519319300979,247

METHODS: We searched enteric fever outbreaks using PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane library. Studies describing a single outbreak event of enteric fever in Asia and Africa from 1965-2019 were reviewed. We excluded case reports, letter to editors, studies reporting typhoid in conjunction with other diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) trip reports, the World Health Organization (WHO) bulletins report, data from mathematical modeling and simulation studies, reviews and ProMed alert. Also, non-typhoidal salmonella outbreaks were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 5063 articles were identified using the key terms and 68 studies were selected for data extraction. Most (48, 71%) outbreaks were from Asian countries, 20 (29%) were reported from Africa. Only 15 studies reported the case definition used for case identification during an outbreak and 8 of those were from Asia. A third (20, 29%) of the studies described antibiotic resistance pattern. 43 (63%) studies contained information regarding the source of the outbreak. Outcomes (hospitalization and deaths) were reported in a quarter of studies. Only 23 (29%) of the studies reported outbreak control strategies while none reported any unified outbreak score or a checklist to identify the outbreak. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the variability in detection and reporting methods for enteric fever outbreaks in Asia and Africa. No standardized case definitions or laboratory methods were reported. Only a few studies reported strategies for outbreak control.

OBJECTIVES: We have evaluated the performance of two novel reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) targeting specifically hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus in combination with a conserved matrix PCR. In addition, we investigated the performance of a novel discrimination RT-PCR for detection of the H275Y resistance mutation in the neuraminidase gene. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical performance of both subtype specific RT-PCR assays was evaluated through analysis of 684 throat swaps collected from individuals meeting the WHO case definition for the novel pandemic influenza virus. Analytical performance was analyzed through testing of 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA derived from the first Dutch sequenced and cultured confirmed case of novel pandemic influenza infection. Specificity and discriminative capacities of the H275Y discrimination assay were performed by testing wild type and recombinant H275Y pandemic influenza. RESULTS: 121 throat swaps collected from April 2009 to July 2009 were positive by at least two out of three RT-PCRs, and negative for the seasonal H3/H1 subtype specific RT-PCR assays. 117 of these were tested positive for all three (Ct-values from 15.1 to 36.8).

While worldwide efforts are being advanced towards vaccine development, the structural modeling of TCR-pMHC (T Cell Receptor-peptide-bound Major Histocompatibility Complex) regarding SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and the design of effective T cell vaccine based on these antigens are still unresolved. Here, we present both pMHC and TCR-pMHC interfaces to infer peptide epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Accordingly, significant TCR-pMHC templates (Z-value cutoff > 4) along with interatomic interactions within the SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptides were clarified. Also, we applied the structural analysis of the hit peptides from different coronaviruses to highlight a feature of evolution in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, bat-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Peptide-protein flexible docking between each of the hit peptides and their corresponding MHC molecules were performed, and a multi-hit peptides vaccine against the S and N glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was designed. Filtering pipelines including antigenicity, and also physiochemical properties of designed vaccine were then evaluated by different immunoinformatics tools. Finally, vaccine-structure modeling and immune simulation of the desired vaccine were performed aiming to create robust T cell immune responses. We anticipate that our design based on the T cell antigen epitopes and the frame of the immunoinformatics analysis could serve as valuable supports for the development of COVID-19 vaccine.","Mohseni, Amir Hossein; Taghinezhad-S, Sedigheh; Su, Bing; Wang, Feng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.12.294413,247

Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to one of three regimen groups at a ratio of 1:1:1. The primary outcome of this study was admission to the intensive care unit. Secondary outcomes were intubation, in-hospital mortality, time to clinical recovery, and length of hospital stay (LOS). Between April 13 and August 9, 2020, a total of 336 patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the 3 treatment regimens including group I (hydroxychloroquine stat, prednisolone, azithromycin and naproxen; 120 patients), group II (hydroxychloroquine stat, azithromycin and naproxen; 116 patients), and group III (hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir (116 patients). The mean LOS in patients receiving prednisolone was 5.5 in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population and 4.4 days in the per-protocol (PP) population compared with 6.4 days (mITT population) and 5.8 days (PP population) in patients treated with Lopinavir/Ritonavir. RESULTS: The mean LOS was significantly lower in the mITT and PP populations who received prednisolone compared with populations treated with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (p = 0.028; p = 0.0007). We observed no significant differences in the number of deaths, ICU admission, and need for mechanical ventilation between the Modified ITT and per-protocol populations treated with prednisolone and Lopinavir/Ritonavir, although these outcomes were better in the arm treated with prednisolone. The time to clinical recovery was similar in the modified ITT and per-protocol populations treated with prednisolone, lopinavir/ritonavir, and azithromycin (P = 0.335; P = 0.055; p = 0.291; p = 0.098). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that therapeutic regimen (regimen I) with low dose prednisolone was superior to other regimens in shortening the length of hospital stay in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.

FIB-4 is a noninvasive index of readily available laboratory measurements that represents hepatic fibrosis. We sought to evaluate the association between FIB-4 at an early stage of infection and COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: FIB-4 was evaluated at admission in a cohort of 267 patients admitted with early-stage COVID-19 confirmed through RT-PCR. Hazard of ventilator use and of high-flow oxygen was estimated using Cox regression models controlled for covariates. Risk of progress to severe cases and of death/prolonged hospitalization (>30 days) were estimated using logistic regression models controlled for same covariates. RESULTS: Forty-one (15%) patients progressed to severe cases, 36 (14%) required high-flow oxygen support, 10 (4%) required mechanical ventilator support, and 1 died. Patients with high FIB-4 score (>3.25) were more likely to be older with pre-existing conditions. FIB-4 between 1.45-3.25 was associated with over 5-fold (95% CI: 1.2-28) increased hazard of high-flow oxygen use, over 4-fold (95% CI: 1.5-14.6) increased odds of progress to severe stage, and over 3-fold (95% CI: 1.4-7.7) increased odds of death or prolonged hospitalization. FIB-4>3.25 was associated with over 12-fold (95% CI: 2.3-68. 7) increased hazard of high-flow oxygen use and over 11-fold (95% CI: 3.1-45) increased risk of progress to severe disease. All associations were independent of sex, number of comorbidities, and inflammatory markers (D-dimer, C-reactive protein).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study of a randomly selected cohort of consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection between March 8, 2020 through April 25, 2020. All eligible patients underwent a computed tomography pulmonary angiography independently of their PE clinical suspicion and were pre-screened for a baseline elevated D-dimer level. RESULTS: 119 patients were randomly selected from the 372 admitted to one tertiary hospital in Valencia (Spain) for COVID-19 infection during the period of study. Seventy-three patients fulfilled both the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and were finally included in the study. Despite a high level of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (89%), the incidence of PE was 35.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29.6 to 41.6%), mostly with a peripheral location and low thrombotic load (Qanadli score 18.5%). Multivariate analysis showed that heart rate (Hazard Ratio [HR], 1.04), room-air oxygen saturation (spO2) (HR, 0.87), D-dimer (HR, 1.02), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (HR, 1.01) at the time of admission were independent predictors of incident PE during hospitalization.

It has also caused various psychological issues among public such as uncertainty, fear, anxiety, and of course stress. Globalization has facilitated it and has added greater complexity to the containment of infection leading to urgent call for public health challenge. Consequently, a multilevel stress coping adjustment process is going on. Hence, it is imperative to explore how people are affected psychologically and how they are coping with it. People are adopting different strategies for coping up from this challenging situation. In this sense, the present study intended to: explore which coping strategies were of relevance for people for adjusting in COVID-19 crises and were sociodemographic factors influencing the coping strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research is descriptive study. For the present study, a sample of 475 participants was asked for coping strategies used by them using valid and reliable scales. RESULTS: Results revealed that positive attitude and trust in God were the most used adaptive coping strategies and sociodemographic variables were playing a significant role in adaptive coping strategies. CONCLUSION: Hence, understanding and identification of coping strategies and their relationship with demographic variables can help health professionals to direct interventions to control stressors related to the pandemics.","Javed, Sarah; Parveen, Heena",J Educ Health Promot,https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_522_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34084869/,247
661351,Is the ACE2 Overexpression a Risk Factor for COVID-19 Infection?,2020-04-04,"COVID-19 is characterized by respiratory symptoms of various severities, ranging from mild upper respiratory signs to acute respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with a high mortality rate. However, the pathophysiology of the disease is largely unknown. Shotgun metagenomics from nasopharyngeal swabs were used to characterize the genomic, metagenomic and transcriptomic features of patients from the first pandemic wave with various forms of COVID-19, including outpatients, patients hospitalized not requiring intensive care, and patients in the intensive care unit, to identify viral and/or host factors associated with the most severe forms of the disease. Neither the genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, nor the detection of bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites were associated with the severity of pulmonary disease. Severe pneumonia was associated with overexpression of cytokine transcripts activating the CXCR2 pathway, whereas patients with benign disease presented with a T helper “Th1-Th17” profile. The latter profile was associated with female gender and a lower mortality rate. Our findings indicate that the most severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by the presence of overactive immune cells resulting in neutrophil pulmonary infiltration which, in turn, could enhance the inflammatory response and prolong tissue damage. These findings make CXCR2 antagonists, in particular IL-8 antagonists, promising candidates for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.","Rodriguez, Christophe; de Prost, Nicolas; Fourati, Slim; Lamoureux, Claudie; Gricourt, Guillaume; N’debi, Melissa; Canoui-Poitrine, Florence; Désveaux, Isaac; Picard, Oriane; Demontant, Vanessa; Trawinski, Elisabeth; Lepeule, Raphaël; Surgers, Laure; Vindrios, William; Lelièvre, Jean-Daniel; Mongardon, Nicolas; Langeron, Olivier; Cohen, José L.; Mekontso-Dessap, Armand; Woerther, Paul-Louis; Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780519/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009416,247

Data on hepatic histopathological findings in COVID-19 is scarce. AIM: To characterize hepatic pathological findings in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020192813), following PRISMA guidelines. Eligible trials were those including patients of any age and COVID-19 diagnosis based on a molecular test. Histopathological reports from deceased COVID-19 patients undergoing autopsy or liver biopsy were reviewed. Articles including less than ten patients were excluded. Proportions were pooled using random-effects models. Q statistic and I(2) were used to assess heterogeneity and levels of evidence, respectively. RESULTS: We identified 18 studies from 7 countries; all were case reports and case series from autopsies. All the patients were over 15 years old, and 67.2% were male. We performed a meta-analysis of 5 studies, including 116 patients. Pooled prevalence estimates of liver histopathological findings were hepatic steatosis 55.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 46.2-63.8], congestion of hepatic sinuses 34.7% (95%CI: 7.9-68.4), vascular thrombosis 29.4% (95%CI: 0.4-87.2), fibrosis 20.5% (95%CI: 0.6-57.9), Kupffer cell hyperplasia 13.5% (95%CI: 0.6-54.3), portal inflammation 13.2% (95%CI: 0.1-48.8), and lobular inflammation 11.6% (95%CI: 0.3-35.7). We also identified the presence of venous outflow obstruction, phlebosclerosis of the portal vein, herniated portal vein, periportal abnormal vessels, hemophagocytosis, and necrosis. CONCLUSION: We found a high prevalence of hepatic steatosis and vascular thrombosis as major histological liver features. Other frequent findings included portal and lobular inflammation and Kupffer cell hyperplasia or proliferation.

661816,"Narrative Medicine to integrate patients’, caregivers’ and clinicians’ migraine experiences: the DRONE multicentre project",2021-04-15,"OBJECTIVES: The unprecedented worldwide social distancing response to COVID-19 resulted in a quick reversal of escalating case numbers. Recently, local governments globally have begun to relax social distancing regulations. Using the situation in Manitoba, Canada as an example, we estimated the impact that social distancing relaxation may have on the pandemic. METHODS: We fit a mathematical model to empirically estimated numbers of people infected, recovered, and died from COVID-19 in Manitoba. We then explored the impact of social distancing relaxation on: (a) time until near elimination of COVID-19 (< one case per million), (b) time until peak prevalence, (c) proportion of the population infected within one year, (d) peak prevalence, and (e) deaths within one year. RESULTS: Assuming a closed population, near elimination of COVID-19 in Manitoba could have been achieved in 4–6 months (by July or August) if there were no relaxation of social distancing. Relaxing to 15% of pre-COVID effective contacts may extend the local epidemic for more than two years (median 2.1). Relaxation to 50% of pre-COVID effective contacts may result in a peak prevalence of 31–38% of the population, within 3–4 months of initial relaxation. CONCLUSION: Slight relaxation of social distancing may immensely impact the pandemic duration and expected peak prevalence. Only holding the course with respect to social distancing may have resulted in near elimination before Fall of 2020; relaxing social distancing to 15% of pre-COVID-19 contacts will flatten the epidemic curve but greatly extend the duration of the pandemic.","Shafer, Leigh Anne; Nesca, Marcello; Balshaw, Robert",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33406102/,247

The accessibility of high-throughput methods and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has facilitated a growing ecosystem of protocols. Two differing protocols are tiling multiplex PCR and bait capture enrichment. Each method has advantages and disadvantages but a direct comparison with different viral RNA concentrations has not been performed to assess the performance of these approaches. Here we compare Liverpool amplification, ARTIC amplification, and bait capture using clinical diagnostics samples. All libraries were sequenced using an Illumina MiniSeq with data analyzed using a standardized bioinformatics workflow (SARS-CoV-2 Illumina GeNome Assembly Line; SIGNAL). One sample showed poor SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage and consensus, reflective of low viral RNA concentration. In contrast, the second sample had a higher viral RNA concentration, which yielded good genome coverage and consensus. ARTIC amplification showed the highest depth of coverage results for both samples, suggesting this protocol is effective for low concentrations. Liverpool amplification provided a more even read coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, but at a lower depth of coverage. Bait capture enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 cDNA provided results on par with amplification. While only two clinical samples were examined in this comparative analysis, both the Liverpool and ARTIC amplification methods showed differing efficacy for high and low concentration samples. In addition, amplification-free bait capture enriched sequencing of cDNA is a viable method for generating a SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence and for identification of amplification artifacts.","Nasir, Jalees A.; Kozak, Robert A.; Aftanas, Patryk; Raphenya, Amogelang R.; Smith, Kendrick M.; Maguire, Finlay; Maan, Hassaan; Alruwaili, Muhannad; Banerjee, Arinjay; Mbareche, Hamza; Alcock, Brian P.; Knox, Natalie C.; Mossman, Karen; Wang, Bo; Hiscox, Julian A.; McArthur, Andrew G.; Mubareka, Samira",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12080895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32824272/,247

Sanitary protection measures are not specifically recommended within household. We wanted to study the risk of seroconversion in cancer patients according to their household exposure. Patients and methods The seroprevalence study is a prevalence study in Torrejon de Ardoz (Spain), and analyzed the seeroprevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies in 104,299 volunteers (participation rate of 74.8% of population) from May 29th to June 5th, 2020. Personal authorization was requested to collect by questionnaire the test result from cancer patients who attended the outpatients department of the University Hospital of Torrejón and their cohabitants between June 1 st and June 19th 2020. Results 229 cancer patients were included in the study. Sixty-four of the 229 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (27.9%) and 22 patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies (9.6%). The overall seroprevalence (IgG or IgM positive) was 31.4% (general population seroprevalence was of 10% in Spain). Of 72 seropositive patients, 54.2% had intrafamilial exposure vs 45.8% did not. Among seronegative patients, 30.6% had seropositive cohabitants. The probability of seropositivity for a cancer patient was significantly related to intrafamilial exposure (OR of 2.684, 95% CI 1.51 – 4.76, p = 0.001). Conclusions Cancer patients are a high-risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and could need to implement recommendations against virus transmission even in a household scenario as it is the main factor significantly related to seroconversion.","Palka-Kotlowska, M; Custodio-Cabello, S; Oliveros-Acebes, E; Khosravi-Shahi, P; Cabezón-Gutierrez, L",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33556611/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.01.072; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221000850; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221000850?v=s5,247

The M gene of LJB/03 was amplified from the RNA extracted directly from the fece samples by RT-PCR and cloned into pMD18-T vector. The M gene cDNA was sequenced and encompasses an open reading frame of 681 nucleotides, encoding a 226-amino acid protein. The LJB/03 M gene has a base composition of 152 adenines (22%), 153 cytosines (23%), 161 guanines (24%), and 214 thymines (31%). Sequence comparison with other PEDV strains selected from GenBank revealed that the LJB/03 M gene has a high sequence homology to those of other PEDV isolates, 97.80% with JMe2, 96.92% with KPEDV-9 (Korean field isolate), 97.36% with KPEDV-9 (Korean), 97.80% with Br1/87, and 97.94% with CV777.

663124,Use of Remdesivir in Myasthenia gravis and COVID‐19,2021-04-27,"Background: Twitter has emerged as a critical source of free and openly available information during emergency response operations, providing an unmatched level of on-the-ground situational awareness in real-time. Responders and survivors turn to Twitter to share information and resources within communities, conduct rumor control, and provide a “boots on the ground” understanding of the disaster. However, the ability to tune out background “noise” is essential to effectively utilizing Twitter to identify important and useful information during an emergency response. Methods: This article highlights a two-prong strategy in which the use of a Twitter list paired with subject specific Boolean searches provided increased situational awareness and early event detection during the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) response to Superstorm Sandy in 2012. To maximize the amount of relevant information that was retrieved, the Twitter list and Boolean searches were dynamic and responsive to real-time developments, evolving health threats, and the informational needs of decision-makers. Conclusion: The use of a Twitter list combined with Boolean searches led to enhanced situational awareness throughout the HHS response. The incorporation of a dynamic search strategy over the course of the HHS Sandy response, allowed for the ability to account for over-tweeted information, changes in event related conversation, and decreases in the return of relevant information.","Harris Smith, Sara; Bennett, Kelly J.; Livinski, Alicia A.",PLoS Curr,https://doi.org/10.1371/currents.dis.de9415573fbf90ee2c585cd0b2314547; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25642372/,247

In total, 40% of the participants had moderate to severe anxiety, 72% had depressive symptoms and 53% had moderate to poor mental health status. Moreover, path analysis showed worrying about COVID-19 and knowledge about the virus predicted anxiety and moderate to poor mental health status; knowledge and belief about COVID-19’s severity in Bangladesh predicted depressive symptoms. Thus, revealing that mental health issues were high and COVID-19 worry predicted psychopathology symptoms among Bangladeshi university students.

The tracing of confirmed cases and the prediction of the local dynamics of contagion through early indicators are crucial measures to a successful fight against emerging infectious diseases (EID). The proposed framework is model-free and applies Early Warning Detection Systems (EWDS) techniques to detect changes in the territorial spread of infections in the very early stages of onset. This study uses publicly available raw data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 mainly sourced from the database of the Italian Civil Protection Department. Two distinct EWDS approaches, the Hub-Jones (H&J) and Strozzi-Zaldivar (S&Z), are adapted and applied to the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. They promptly generate warning signals and detect the onset of an epidemic at early surveillance stages even if working on the limited daily available, open-source data. Additionally, EWDS S&Z criterion is theoretically validated on the basis of the epidemiological SIR. Discussed EWDS successfully analyze self-accelerating systems, like the SARS-CoV-2 scenario, to precociously identify an epidemic spread through the calculation of onset parameters. This approach can also facilitate early clustering detection, further supporting common fight strategies against the spread of EIDs. Overall, we are presenting an effective tool based on solid scientific and methodological foundations to be used to complement medical actions to contrast the spread of infections such as COVID-19.","Vianello, Chiara; Strozzi, Fernanda; Mocellin, Paolo; Cimetta, Elisa; Fabiano, Bruno; Manenti, Flavio; Pozzi, Rossella; Maschio, Giuseppe",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X2032180X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33342518/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.12.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X2032180X,247

These include two mutations in the N terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein, HV69-70del and Y144del (also known as Y145del due to the presence of tyrosine at both positions). We recently identified several emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns, characterized by Membrane (M) protein mutations, including I82T and V70L. We now identify a sub-lineage of B.1.1.7 that emerged through sequential acquisitions of M:V70L in November 2020 followed by a novel S:D178H mutation first observed in early February 2021. The percentage of B.1.1.7 isolates in the US that belong to this sub-lineage increased from 0.15% in February 2021 to 1.8% in April 2021. To date, this sub-lineage appears to be U.S.-specific with reported cases in 31 states, including Hawaii. As of April 2021, it constituted 36.8% of all B.1.1.7 isolates in Washington. Phylogenetic analysis and transmission inference with Nextstrain suggest this sub-lineage likely originated in either California or Washington. Structural analysis revealed that the S:D178H mutation is in the NTD of the S protein and close to two other signature mutations of B.1.1.7, HV69-70del and Y144del.

FIB-4 is a noninvasive index of readily available laboratory measurements that represents hepatic fibrosis. The association of FIB-4 with COVID-19 outcomes has not been previously evaluated. Methods FIB-4 was evaluated at admission in a cohort of 267 patients admitted with early-stage COVID-19 confirmed through RT-PCR. Hazard of ventilator use and of high-flow oxygen was estimated using Cox regression models controlled for covariates. Risk of progress to severe cases and of death/prolonged hospitalization (>30 days) were estimated using logistic regression models controlled for same covariates. Results Forty-one (15%) patients progressed to severe cases, 36 (14%) required high-flow oxygen support, 10 (4%) required mechanical ventilator support, and 1 died. Patients with high FIB-4 score (>3.25) were more likely to be older with pre-existing conditions. FIB-4 between 1.45-3.25 was associated with over 5-fold (95% CI: 1.2-28) increased hazard of high-flow oxygen use, over 4-fold (95% CI: 1.5-14.6) increased odds of progress to severe stage, and over 3-fold (95% CI: 1.4-7.7) increased odds of death or prolonged hospitalization. FIB-4>3.25 was associated with over 12-fold (95% CI: 2.3-68. 7) increased hazard of high-flow oxygen use and over 11-fold (95% CI: 3.1-45) increased risk of progress to severe disease. All associations were independent of sex, number of comorbidities, and inflammatory markers (D-dimer, C-reactive protein).

The response of the gamma-oscillation to human visual stimuli is known to be both burst and resonant in nature, and the coupling between alpha and gamma oscillations may play a functional role in visual processing. To date, there is no study that examined the effects of gamma-frequency violet light (VL) stimulation on human electroencephalography (EEG). In this study, we investigated the neurophysiological changes induced by light stimulation using EEG. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the specific effects of 40 Hz gamma-frequency VL stimulation on EEG activity by comparing the effects of white light (WL) with the same condition. Twenty healthy participants (10 females: 37.5 ± 14.3 years; 10 males: 38.0 ± 13.3 years) participated in this study and the following results were observed. First, when compared with the power spectrum density (PSD) of baseline EEG, 40 Hz-WL induced significant increase of PSD in theta band. Second, compared the PSDs between EEG with 40 Hz-VL and EEG with 40 Hz-WL, 40 Hz-VL induced significantly lower enhancement in delta and theta bands than 40 Hz-WL. Third, when focused on the occipital area, negative peak of VEP with 40 Hz-VL was smaller than that of 40 Hz-WL. Fourth, 40 Hz-VL induced an increase of alpha-gamma coupling during the VEP at the F5 electrode site as well as post-EEG at the C4 electrode site, compared with baseline EEG. Thus, the present study suggested that 40 Hz-VL stimulation may induce unique photobiological neuromodulations on human EEG activity.","Noda, Yoshihiro; Takano, Mayuko; Hayano, Motoshi; Li, Xuemei; Wada, Masataka; Nakajima, Shinichiro; Mimura, Masaru; Kondo, Shinichiro; Tsubota, Kazuo",J Pers Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11060557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203878/,247

ANIMALS: Client‐owned dogs (n = 12) and cats (n = 10). PROCEDURES: Examination findings and diagnostic test results including aqueous humor cytology were compared. RESULTS: Disease duration prior to aqueocentesis was not significantly different between dogs with idiopathic anterior uveitis and those with an etiologic diagnosis, but was shorter in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) than those with idiopathic uveitis. Microbial nucleic acids, antigens, or antibodies against them were seldom found in blood/serum; however, serum feline coronavirus titers ≥1:6400 were detected only in cats with FIP. Aqueous humor cytology was diagnostic in no cats and two dogs, both with neoplasia. Although aqueous humor contained predominantly neutrophils in cats with FIP and large reactive lymphocytes and plasma cells appeared more frequent in cats with idiopathic uveitis, neither clinical nor cytologic assessment of anterior chamber contents differed significantly between cats with idiopathic or FIP‐associated uveitis. Cytologically assessed plasma cell number was correlated with keratic precipitates and disease duration. Clinically detectable hyphema and cytologic erythrocyte number were correlated. However, cytologic cell grades and clinical grade of flare or cell numbers within the anterior chamber were not correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Aqueous humor cytology permitted diagnosis of neoplasia in dogs with anterior uveitis but was generally not helpful in cats. Poor correlation between clinical and cytologic assessment of cell numbers and type within the anterior chamber dictates that clinical grading should not be the sole criterion for electing to perform aqueocentesis.","Wiggans, K.

COVID‐19 was confirmed by a presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 ribonucleic acid in the respiratory specimens detected by a qualitative, real‐time reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction. The study focused on the clinical course and management of our cases. RESULTS: A family cluster of four laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19 patients, one of those carried an underlying kidney transplant (KT) receiving immunosuppressants. Clinical presentation and severity of our case series are variable depending on each individual immune status. By far, a KT recipient seems to develop more severity despite antiviral therapy, cessation of immunosuppressant, and aggressive intensive care support. CONCLUSION: Our case series plausibly affirmed a person‐to‐person transmission and potentially severe disease in the transplant population. Clinicians who are encountering with transplant recipients should be aware of possible transmission among family members.","Sakulkonkij, Parichart; Bruminhent, Jackrapong; Pankongngam, Charan; Chalermphunchai, Nipon",Immun Inflamm Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32770646/; https://doi.org/10.1002/iid3.337,247

667761,Could anti‐tubercular vaccination protect against COVID‐19 infection?,2020-07-09,"Testing representative populations to determine the prevalence or percent of the population with active SARS-Cov-2 infection and/or antibodies to infection is being recommended as essential for making public policy decisions to open-up or to continue enforcing national, state and local government rules to “shelter-in-place”. However, all laboratory tests are imperfect and have estimates of sensitivity and specificity less than 100% - in some cases considerably less than 100%. That error will lead to biased prevalence estimates. If the true prevalence is low, possibly in the range of 1-5%, then testing error will lead to a constant background of bias that will most likely be larger and possibly much larger than the true prevalence itself. As a result, what is needed is a method for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error. In this paper we outline methods for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error both prospectively in studies being planned and retrospectively in studies that have been conducted. The methods if employed would also help to harmonize study results within countries and world-wide. Adjustment can lead to more accurate prevalence estimates and to better policy decisions. However, adjustment will not improve the accuracy of an individual test.","Sempos, Christopher T; Tian, Lu",Am J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaa174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803245/,247

It is unknown whether nocturnal hypoxemia occurring in smokers, with or without COPD, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) or their overlap, may be associated with PAE assessed by chest CT. Methods: We analysed data from two prospective cohort studies that enrolled 284 smokers in lung cancer screening programs and completing baseline home sleep studies and chest CT scans. Main pulmonary artery diameter (PAD) and the ratio of the PAD to that of the aorta (PA:Ao ratio) were measured. PAE was defined as a PAD ≥ 29 mm in men and ≥27 mm in women or as a PA:Ao ratio > 0.9. We evaluated the association of PAE with baseline characteristics using multivariate logistic models. Results: PAE prevalence was 27% as defined by PAD measurements and 11.6% by the PA:Ao ratio. A body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) (OR 2.01; 95%CI 1.06–3.78), lower % predicted of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) (OR 1.03; 95%CI 1.02–1.05) and higher % of sleep time with O(2) saturation < 90% (T90) (OR 1.02; 95%CI 1.00–1.03), were associated with PAE as determined by PAD. However, only T90 remained significantly associated with PAE as defined by the PA:Ao ratio (OR 1.02; 95%CI 1.01–1.03). In the subset group without OSA, only T90 remains associated with PAE, whether defined by PAD measurement (OR 1.02; 95%CI 1.01–1.03) or PA:Ao ratio (OR 1.04; 95%CI 1.01–1.07).

668917,(In)Visible illness: A photovoice study of the lived experience of self-managing rheumatoid arthritis,2021-03-08,"The COVID‐19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on almost all aspects of human society and endeavour; the natural world and its conservation have not been spared. Through a process of expert consultation, we identified and categorised, into 19 themes and 70 sub‐themes, the ways in which biodiversity and its conservation has been or could be impacted by the pandemic globally; nearly 60% of which were broadly negative in impact. Subsequently, we created a compendium (see Supporting Information) of all themes and sub‐themes, each with explanatory text, and in August 2020 a diverse group of experienced conservationists with expertise from across sectors and geographies assessed each sub‐theme for its likely impact on biodiversity conservation globally. The 9 sub‐themes ranked highest were all negative in impact. These were, in rank order: governments side‐lining the environment during their economic recovery, reduced wildlife‐based tourism income, increased habitat destruction, reduced government funding, increased plastic and other solid waste pollution, weakening of pro‐nature regulations and their enforcement, increased illegal harvest of wild animals, reduced philanthropy, and threats to survival of conservation organisations. In combination, these impacts present a worrying future of increased threats to biodiversity conservation but reduced capacity to counter them. The highest‐ranking positive impact, at 10, was the beneficial impact of wildlife trade restrictions. More optimistically, amongst impacts ranked 11 to 20, 6 were positive and 4 were negative. We hope our assessment will draw attention to the impacts of the pandemic, improving the conservation community's ability to respond to them in the future.

The aim of the present study was to assess initial data on the mental health burden of the German public during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Germany and collected complete datasets from 15 704 German residents aged 18 years and over. Besides demographics, generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2) and psychological distress (DT) were assessed. Furthermore, COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 were covered. RESULTS: Significantly increased symptoms were highly prevalent in all dimensions: generalized anxiety (44.9%), depression (14.3%), psychological distress (65.2%) and COVID-19-related fear (59%). Females and younger people reported higher mental burden. Trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 are negatively associated with mental health burden. However, the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 is positively associated with increased COVID-19-related fear.

669425,COVID-19: A One-center Experience in Paris,2020-12-18,"INTRODUCTION: Although the proportion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) has increased steadily, the relationship between patient background and preference for bDMARDs has not been fully investigated. METHODS: We conducted a web-based questionnaire survey among patients aged ≥ 20 years with RA receiving bDMARDs. Participants were recruited through an internet research company in Japan. Study endpoints included factors affecting the preferred bDMARD treatment mode, namely, in-hospital intravenous infusion (infusion), in-hospital subcutaneous injection (in-hospital injection), or self-administered subcutaneous injection (self-injection), and discrepancies between the current and preferred treatment mode. RESULTS: Of the 400 patients surveyed for preferred treatment mode, 15.3% preferred infusion, 18.0% preferred in-hospital injection, and 66.8% preferred self-injection. A preference for infusion (odds ratio [OR] 2.218 and 6.165) and in-hospital injection (OR 4.735 and 6.026) versus self-injection was significantly associated with higher current frequency of hospital visits and anxiety or other hurdles related to self-injection. A flexible administration setting was significantly associated with a preference for self-injection versus infusion (OR 0.401) and versus in-hospital injection (OR 0.445). Further, age (< 40 vs. ≥ 60 years) was significantly associated with a preference for self-injection versus in-hospital injection (OR 0.120). Many patients reported no discrepancy between their current and preferred treatment mode (patients receiving infusion, 68.0%; in-hospital injection, 71.2%; and self-injection, 94.0%). However, > 90% of patients responded that they would change their current mode in the future following a recommendation by a medical professional, aging, or a change in RA symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This web-based survey showed that patient preference for bDMARD treatment mode was significantly associated with age, frequency of hospital visits, flexible administration setting, and anxiety or other hurdles to self-injection. Changes in patient background which affect the preferred treatment mode should be considered in decision-making for RA therapy with bDMARDs.

This study aimed to evaluate the extent of social media utilization in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic by plastic surgery residency programs. METHODS Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook accounts of plastic surgery programs, program directors, and chiefs were identified. Number of followers, total posts, and posts since March 1, 2020, were extracted. Account content was categorized as informational, social, operative, research, self-promotional, guest lecture, education, or other. Spearman's coefficient was used to determine correlations among account data. Differences among regions and program pathways were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS Since March 1, 2020, 17 Instagram, five Twitter, and three Facebook accounts have been created. Instagram was most widely used and followed (1720 posts, 1235.7 ± 735.9 followers) compared with Twitter (722 tweets, 325.6 ± 451.0 followers) and Facebook (430 posts, 338.3 ± 363.3 followers). Although the majority of content was informational (45.1 percent), Instagram contained more social content (21 percent), Twitter contained more research (21 percent), and Facebook contained more self-promotional content (25 percent). Integrated-only programs posted more on Instagram (21.5 ± 15.1 posts) than did independent-only programs (9.4 ± 8.5 posts), and post volume moderately correlated with number of followers. There were no statistically significant differences among regional means. CONCLUSION Plastic surgery residency programs have incorporated social media into their recruitment strategies and will likely continue to increase and diversify their posts to effectively engage with future applicants.","Shiah, Eric; Laikhter, Elizabeth; Manstein, Samuel M; Comer, Carly D; Shen, Abra H; Lin, Samuel J",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000008482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34586097/,247

The dramatic increase in the number of cases and deaths have placed tremendous strain on healthcare systems worldwide. As healthcare workers and society adjust to focus treatment and prevention of COVID-19, other facets of the healthcare enterprise are affected, particularly surgical volume and revenue. Objective The purpose of this study is to describe the financial impact of COVID-19 on an academic neurosurgery department. Methods A retrospective review of weekly average daily work relative value units (wRVU) was compared before and after COVID-19 in the fiscal year 2020. A comparative time period of the same months in the year prior was also included for review. We also review strategies for triaging neurosurgical disease as needing emergent, urgent, or routine operative treatment. Results Daily average wRVU after COVID-19 dropped significantly with losses in all weeks examined. Of the 7 weeks in the current post-COVID period the weekly daily average wRVU was 173 (range 128-363). The mean decline was 51.4% compared to the pre-COVID era.

Plus de 50 000 patients vivant avec le VIH y sont suivis. L’objectif était de déterminer les facteurs de risques associés aux formes sévères et critiques d’infection COVID-19 chez les patients vivant avec le VIH (PVVIH). Matériels et méthodes Tous les patients ayant présenté une infection à COVID-19 soit confirmée soit suspectée et suivis pour une infection par le VIH au sein de notre file active ont été inclus de façon prospective entre le 1er mars et le 30 avril 2020. Les patients étaient considérés comme ayant une forme bénigne en cas de prise en charge ambulatoire, sévère en cas de nécessité d’introduction d’une oxygénothérapie et critique en cas d’admission en unité de soins intensifs pour détresse respiratoire aiguë ou en cas de défaillance multiviscérale. Résultats Sur cette période, 54 PVVIH (dont 61,1 % d’hommes) suivis au sein de notre structure ont présenté une forme symptomatique de maladie COVID-19. L’âge médian était de 54 ans, le taux médian de lymphocytes T CD4+ (LT CD4) antérieur à l’épisode de COVID-19 était à 583/mm3 [IQR: 473–749] et 96,2 % avaient une charge virale VIH<40 copies/mL. Le dernier traitement antirétroviral comprenait un inhibiteur de protéase pour 9 patients (16,7 %). Le diagnostic était considéré comme confirmé pour 38 patients et probable pour 16 patients. Trente-cinq patients (64,8 %) ont présenté une forme bénigne, 14 (25,9 %) une forme sévère et 5 (9,3 %) une forme critique. En analyse multivariée, l’âge (OR: 1,11 [IC95 %: 1,02–1,22]), le sexe masculin (OR féminin: 0,10 [IC95 %: 0,01–0,71]), être originaire d’Afrique subsaharienne (OR: 28,8 [IC95 %: 3,30–250,9]), et la présence d’un syndrome métabolique (OR: 12,49 [IC95 %: 2,16–72,8]), étaient associés aux formes sévères ou critiques de COVID-19. Il n’existait pas de différence significative selon le dernier taux de LT CD4 au sein des différents groupes.

In similar epidemics, nurses experienced more distress than other providers. Methods: We surveyed both on-duty nurses caring for infected patients and second-line nurses caring for uninfected patients from Hubei and other provinces throughout China. Results: We received completed surveys from 1,364 nurses from 22 provinces: 658 front-line and 706 second-line nurses. The median (IQR) GHQ-28 score of all nurses was 17 (IQR 11–24). The overall incidence of mild-to-moderate distress (GHQ score > 5) was 28%; that for severe distress (GHQ score > 11) was 6%. The incidence of mild-to-moderate distress in the second-line nurses was higher than that in the front-line nurses (31 vs. 25%; OR, 0.74; 95 CI, 0.58–0.94).

In response, the US government, utilizing the Defense Production Act ordered the development of 200,000 ventilators from 11 different manufacturers. These ventilators have different capabilities and it is not evident whether all are able to support COVID-19 patients. Research Question Evaluate ventilator requirements for affected COVID-19 patients, assess the clinical performance of current SNS ventilators employed during the pandemic, and finally compare ordered ventilators functionality based on COVID-19 patient needs. Study Design and Methods Current published literature, publicly available documents, and lay press articles were reviewed by a diverse team of disaster experts. Data was assembled into tabular format which formed the basis for analysis and future recommendations. Results COVID-19 patients often develop severe hypoxemic acute respiratory failure and ARDS requiring high levels of ventilator support. Current SNS ventilators were unable to fully support all COVID-19 patients, and only about half of newly ordered ventilators have the capacity to support the most severely affected patients; ventilators with less capacity for providing high level support are still of significant value in caring for many patients.

672402,Be aware: COVID-19 the new stroke mimicker,2020-11-16,"This paper describes the first six years of a government-initiated project to train Indigenous health professionals in digital mental health (d-MH). It illustrates how community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods were used to enable this “top-down” project to be transformed into a ‘ground-up’ community-guided process; and how, in turn, the guidance from the local Indigenous community partners went on to influence the national government’s d-MH agenda. The CBPR partnership between five community partners and a university rural health department is described, with illustrations of how CBPR harnessed the community’s voice in making the project relevant to their wellbeing needs. The local Indigenous community’s involvement led to a number of unexpected outcomes, which impacted locally and nationally. At an early stage, the conceptual framework of the project was changed from d-MH to the culturally-relevant Indigenous framework of digital social and emotional wellbeing (d-SEWB). This led to a significant expansion of the range and type of digital resources; and to other notable outcomes such as successful advocacy for an Aboriginal-specific online therapy program and for a dedicated “one-stop-shop” d-SEWB website, Wellmob, which was funded by the Australian government in 2019–2021. Some of the implications of this project for future Indigenous CBPR projects are discussed.","Bennett-Levy, James; Singer, Judy; Rotumah, Darlene; Bernays, Sarah; Edwards, David",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574678/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189757,247

METHODS: Using real-time insights from two Cancer Council NSW services—131120 Information and Support Line and Online Community (CCOC) forums—we assessed service demand trends, distress levels (using the distress thermometer), and content from 131120 calls and online posts between 01 December 2019 and 31 May 2020. Emergent themes were identified through an inductive conventional content analysis with 131120 call notes, followed by a deductive directed content analysis on CCOC posts. RESULTS: In total, 688 COVID-19-related 131120 calls (n = 496) and online posts (n = 192) were analysed. Service demand peaked in March 2020 and self-reported distress peaked in May 2020 at an average of 8/10 [Mean = 7.5; SD = 0.9]. Five themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: psychological distress and fear of virus susceptibility, practical issues, cancer service disruptions, information needs, and carer Issues. CONCLUSIONS: The psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 on people affected by cancer are multifaceted and likely to have long-lasting consequences. Our findings drove the development of six recommendations across three domains of support, information, and access. Cancer patients, survivors, and carers already face stressful challenges dealing with a cancer diagnosis or survivorship. The added complexity of restrictions and uncertainty associated with the pandemic may compound this. It is important that healthcare providers are equipped to provide patient-centred care during and after this crisis. Our recommendations provide points of consideration to ensure care is tailored and patient oriented.

With a sample of 149 students the study adopts SEM path-analysis model testing procedures and shows that agreeableness and conscientious have positive direct effects on online academic self-efficacy in addition to positive indirect effects on the acceptance of Moodle. Moreover agreeableness and conscientious had an indirect effect on course achievement while none of the five-factor model personality traits had an influence on actual Moodle use. An improved respecified model further affirmed the importance of agreeableness and conscientious and their role in online academic self-efficacy, the acceptance and actual use of Moodle and course achievement outcomes. Fourteen percent of the observed variance in course achievement was explainable through the respecified model. The discussion highlights the implications to be drawn from the data in relation to the current educational landscape from the perspective of the educator.","Rivers, Damian J.",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10478-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33679207/,247
673143,Acute intestinal ischemia in a patient with COVID-19,2020-06-06,"Mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) triggers various pathologies in several mouse strains, including hypergammaglobulinaemia, hepatitis and thymus involution. We reported previously the presence of autoantibodies (autoAb) to liver and kidney fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) in sera from mice infected with MHV-A59. Long-term MHV-infected mice represented a good model of non-pathogenic autoimmune response since the animals were apparently healthy in spite of the presence of autoAb. The aim of this work was to see whether a severe liver injury, which releases endogenous adjuvants, i.e. danger signals, could elicit a broader spectrum of autoAb and perhaps signs of autoimmune hepatitis. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) was injected into mice 30 days after MHV infection, and serum was assayed for autoAb and total IgG 20 days later. The association of MHV infection with the toxic effects of CCl(4) resulted in hypergammaglobulinaemia and the production of autoAb to various liver and kidney proteins. Histological examination of liver samples showed tissue damages but without significant differences between the animals submitted to MHV + CCl(4) and controls, which were either infected by MHV without CCl(4), or poisoned by CCl(4) in the absence of MHV infection. Those results show that liver injury after viral infection may lead to the spreading of the immune response and to an increase of serum IgG, suggesting that the procedure used herein could simulate the onset of autoimmune hepatitis.","Aparicio, José L.; Duhalde-Vega, Maite; Loureiro, María E.; Retegui, Lilia A.",Int Immunopharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2009.02.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19258054/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576909000666; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576909000666,247
673378,Pregnancy and the Risk of Severe COVID-19 Infection: Methodologic Challenges and Research Recommendations,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted the whole of society, requiring rapid implementation of individual-, population-, and system-level public health responses to contain and reduce the spread of infection. Women in the perinatal period (pregnant, birthing, and postpartum) have unique and timely needs for directives on health, safety, and risk aversion during periods of isolation and physical distancing for themselves, their child or children, and other family members. In addition, they are a vulnerable group at increased risk of psychological distress that may be exacerbated in the context of social support deprivation and a high-risk external environment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the public discourse of a perinatal cohort to understand unmet health information and support needs, and the impacts on mothering identity and social dynamics in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: A leading Australian online support forum for women pre- through to postbirth was used to interrogate all posts related to COVID-19 from January 27 to May 12, 2020, inclusive. Key search terms included “COVID,” “corona,” and “pandemic.” A three-phase analysis was conducted, including thematic analysis, sentiment analysis, and word frequency calculations. RESULTS: The search yielded 960 posts, of which 831 were included in our analysis. The qualitative thematic analysis demonstrated reasonable understanding, interpretation, and application of relevant restrictions in place, with five emerging themes identified. These were (1) heightened distress related to a high-risk external environment; (2) despair and anticipatory grief due to deprivation of social and family support, and bonding rituals; (3) altered family and support relationships; (4) guilt-tampered happiness; and (5) family future postponed. Sentiment analysis revealed that the content was predominantly negative (very negative: n=537 and moderately negative: n=443 compared to very positive: n=236 and moderately positive: n=340). Negative words were frequently used in the 831 posts with associated derivatives including “worried” (n=165, 19.9%), “risk” (n=143, 17.2%), “anxiety” (n=98, 11.8%), “concerns” (n=74, 8.8%), and “stress” (n=69, 8.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Women in the perinatal period are uniquely impacted by the current pandemic. General information on COVID-19 safe behaviors did not meet the particular needs of this cohort. The lack of nuanced and timely information may exacerbate the risk of psychological and psychosocial distress in this vulnerable, high-risk group. State and federal public health departments need to provide a central repository of information that is targeted, consistent, accessible, timely, and reassuring. Compensatory social and emotional support should be considered, using alternative measures to mitigate the risk of mental health disorders in this cohort.","Chivers, Bonnie R; Garad, Rhonda M; Boyle, Jacqueline A; Skouteris, Helen; Teede, Helena J; Harrison, Cheryce L",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32857707/; https://doi.org/10.2196/22002,247
673406,Each person is a world in COVID-19,2021-01-22,"The number of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases is increasing in India. This study looks upon the geographic distribution of the virus clades and variants circulating in different parts of India between January and August 2020. The NPS/OPS from representative positive cases from different states and union territories in India were collected every month through the VRDLs in the country and analyzed using next-generation sequencing. Epidemiological analysis of the 689 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples revealed GH and GR to be the predominant clades circulating in different states in India. The northern part of India largely reported the ‘GH’ clade, whereas the southern part reported the ‘GR’, with a few exceptions. These sequences also revealed the presence of single independent mutations—E484Q and N440K—from Maharashtra (first observed in March 2020) and Southern Indian States (first observed in May 2020), respectively. Furthermore, this study indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 variant (VOC, VUI, variant of high consequence and double mutant) was not observed during the early phase of virus transmission (January–August). This increased number of variations observed within a short timeframe across the globe suggests virus evolution, which can be a step towards enhanced host adaptation.","Yadav, Pragya D.; Nyayanit, Dimpal A.; Majumdar, Triparna; Patil, Savita; Kaur, Harmanmeet; Gupta, Nivedita; Shete, Anita M.; Pandit, Priyanka; Kumar, Abhinendra; Aggarwal, Neeraj; Narayan, Jitendra; Vijay, Neetu; Kalawat, Usha; Sugunan, Attayur P.; Munivenkatappa, Ashok; Sharma, Tara; Devi, Sulochna; Majumdar, Tapan; Jaryal, Subhash; Bakshi, Rupinder; Joshi, Yash; Sahay, Rima; Shastri, Jayanti; Singh, Mini; Kumar, Manoj; Rawat, Vinita; Dutta, Shanta; Yadav, Sarita; Krishnasamy, Kaveri; Raut, Sharmila; Biswas, Debasis; Borkakoty, Biswajyoti; Verma, Santwana; Rani, Sudha; Deval, Hirawati; Patel, Disha; Turuk, Jyotirmayee; Malhotra, Bharti; Fomda, Bashir; Nag, Vijaylakshmi; Jain, Amita; Bhargava, Anudita; Potdar, Varsha; Cherian, Sarah; Abraham, Priya; Gopal, Anjani; Panda, Samiran; Bhargava, Balram",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13050925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067745/,247

For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing. First, we will evaluate the tool’s feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing. Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. METHODS: Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. The evaluation of the app’s feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura’s model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. RESULTS: Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun. Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. CONCLUSIONS: This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness.","Meinert, Edward; Milne-Ives, Madison; Surodina, Svitlana; Lam, Ching",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32348293/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19297,247

Methods We performed a cross-sectional and prospective cohort study in Italy during the second COVID-19 wave (from September 30, 2020 until at least February 28, 2021). We used databases from the Italian Ministry of Education, the Veneto region systems of SARS-CoV-2 cases notification and of schools’ secondary cases tracing to compare SARS-CoV-2 incidence in students/school staff and general population and incidence across age groups. Number of tests, secondary infections by type of index case and ratio cases/ tests per school were estimated using an adjusted multivariable generalized linear regression model. Regional reproduction numbers Rt were estimated from Italian Civil Protection daily incidence data with a method of posterior distribution using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Findings SARS-CoV-2 incidence among students was lower than in the general population. Secondary infections at school were <1%, and clusters of ≥2 secondary cases occurred in 5–7% of the analysed schools. Incidence among teachers was comparable to the population of similar age (P = 0.23). Secondary infections among teachers were rare, occurring more frequently when the index case was a teacher than a student (37% vs. 10%, P = 0.007). Before and around the date of school opening in Veneto, SARS-CoV-2 incidence grew maximally in 20–29- and 45–49-years old individuals, not among students. The lag between school opening dates in Italian regions and the increase in the regional COVID-19 Rt was not uniform. Finally, school closures in two regions where they were implemented before other measures did not affect Rt decrease. Interpretation This analysis does not support a role for school opening as a driver of the second COVID-19 wave in Italy, a large European country with high SARS-CoV-2 incidence.

Methods We previously summarized outcomes for 46 pwMS treated with cladribine tablets (CladT) and confirmed or suspected COVID-19, as reported to the Merck KGaA Global Patient Safety Database (Jack et al., 2020). Here, we report an update to January 15, 2021 for 272 reported cases of COVID-19 among CladT-treated pwMS. Case definitions: confirmed = COVID-19 diagnostic test reported as positive; suspected = no confirmatory test performed/reported. Cases fulfilling the criteria of hospitalized, medically significant or fatal were designated as serious, while outcomes were classified per usual pharmacovigilance practice. Results Evaluable cohort: 261 pwMS, median age 41 (range: 18–73) years, 70% female. Confirmed COVID-19, n=160; suspected, n=101 (an additional 11 pwMS with compatible COVID-19 symptoms were not evaluated further given negative PCR tests). Median time to COVID-19 since last CladT treatment course was 162 (range: 0–643) days (n=139). Outcomes: recovered/recovering, n=133 (51%); not recovered/not resolved, n=19 (7%); died, n=1 (0.5%); not reported/missing/pending, n=108 (41%). Of the evaluable cohort, 40 (15%) experienced serious COVID-19; demographics and outcomes were comparable among all patients. A single fatal case was reported of a woman aged 60 years with suspected COVID-19 who initiated CladT treatment in July 2019. No COVID-19 test result was reported. The patient died in December 2020.

We report on the deployment of emergency services for cardiovascular events in a defined region in western Germany during the government-imposed lock-down period. METHODS: We examined 5799 consecutive patients who were treated by emergency services for cardiovascular events during the Covid-19 pandemic (January 1 to April 30, 2020), and compared those to the corresponding time frame in 2019. Examining the emergency physicians’ records provided by nine locations in the area, we found a 20% overall decline in cardiovascular admissions. RESULTS: The greatest reduction could be seen immediately following the government-imposed social restrictions. This reduction was mainly driven by a reduction in discretionary admissions for dizziness/syncope (-53%), heart failure (-38%), exacerbated COPD (-28%) and unstable angina (-23%), while unavoidable admissions for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and stroke were unchanged. There was a greater decline in emergency admissions for patients ≥60 years. There was also a greater reduction in emergency admissions for those living in urban areas compared to suburban areas. CONCLUSIONS: During the Covid-19 pandemic, a significant decline in hospitalization for cardiovascular events was observed during the government-enforced shutdown in a predefined area in western Germany. This reduction in admissions was mainly driven by “discretionary” cardiovascular events (unstable angina, heart failure, exacerbated COPD and dizziness/syncope), but events in which admission was unavoidable (CPR, STEMI and stroke) did not change.","Stöhr, Elisabeth; Aksoy, Adem; Campbell, Meghan; Al Zaidi, Muntadher; Öztürk, Can; Vorloeper, Julia; Lange, Jonas; Sugiura, Atsushi; Wilde, Nihal; Becher, Marc Ulrich; Diepenseifen, Christian; Heister, Ulrich; Nickenig, Georg; Zimmer, Sebastian; Tiyerili, Vedat",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33216804/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242653,247

The purpose of our study was to identify the best repurposing candidates among FDA-approved drugs, based on their predicted antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article describes a drug discovery screening based on a supervised machine learning model, trained on in vitro data encoded in chemical fingerprints, representing particular molecular substructures. Predictive performance of our model has been evaluated using so-called scaffold splits offering a state-of-the-art setup for assessing model's ability to generalize to new chemical spaces, critical for drug repurposing applications. KEY FINDINGS: Our study identified zafirlukast as the best repurposing candidate for COVID-19. SIGNIFICANCE: Zafirlukast could be potent against COVID-19 both due to its predicted antiviral properties and its ability to attenuate the so called cytokine storm. Thus, these two critical mechanisms of action may be combined in one drug as a novel and promising pharmacotherapy in the current pandemic.","Delijewski, Marcin; Haneczok, Jacek",Med Drug Discov,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100077; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590098620300646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33521623/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590098620300646,247
677282,"COVID‐19 in Parkinson's Disease Patients Living in Lombardy, Italy",2020-06-02,"The community lockdown measures implemented in the United States, during late March to end of May of 2020, resulted in a significant reduction in the community transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the country. However, a number of US states are currently experiencing an alarming post-lockdown resurgence of the pandemic, triggering the fear for a possible severe second wave of the pandemic in some US jurisdictions. We designed a mathematical model for addressing the key question of whether or not the universal use of face masks can halt or curtail such resurgence (and possibly avert a second wave, without having to undergo another cycle of major community lockdown) in the states of Arizona, Florida, New York and the entire US. The model was parametrized and fitted using cumulative mortality data from the four jurisdictions. Our study highlights the importance of early implementation of the community lockdown measures. In particular, a sizable reduction in the burden of the pandemic would have been recorded in each of the four jurisdictions if the community lockdown measures were implemented a week or two earlier. These reductions are greatly augmented if the early implementation of the lockdown measures is complemented with a public face masks use strategy. It is shown that the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier, and if a sizable percentage of the residents of the four jurisdictions wore face masks during the respective lockdown periods. If the level of lifting of community lockdown is high (which entails allowing for greater community contacts and re-opening of businesses and social activities, in comparison to what was allowed during the community lockdown period), the states of Arizona and Florida will record a devastating second wave of the pandemic by the end of 2020, while the state of New York and the entire US will record milder second waves. If the level of lifting for the community lockdown was mild (i.e., only allowing very limited community contacts and business activities, in comparison to the lockdown period), only the state of Florida will experience a second wave. The severity of the projected second wave depends on the level of lifting of the community lockdown. For instance, the projected second wave for Arizona and Florida, associated with moderate and high level of lifting of lockdown, will be more severe than their respective first wave. For high level of lifting of lockdown measures, the increased use of face masks after the lockdown period greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic. In particular, for this high lifting scenario, none of the four jurisdictions will experience a second wave if half of their residents wear face masks consistently after their respective lockdown period). A testing strategy that increases the maximum detection rate of asymptomatic infected individuals (followed by contact tracing and self-isolation of the detected cases) greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in all four jurisdictions, particularly if also combined with universal face mask use strategy. Universal use of face masks in public, with at least moderate level of compliance, could halt the post-lockdown resurgence of COVID-19, in addition to averting the potential for (or severity of) a second wave of the pandemic in each of the four jurisdictions.","Ngonghala, C.

Whilst most children and young people develop mild symptoms, recent reports suggest a novel paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). Case definition and classification are preliminary, treatment is empiric and disease-associated outcomes are unclear. Here, we report 29 patients with PIMS-TS who were diagnosed, admitted and treated in the English North West between March and June 2020. Consistent with patterns observed internationally, cases peaked approximately 4 weeks after the initial surge of COVID-19-like symptoms in the UK population. Clinical symptoms included fever (100%), skin rashes (72%), cardiovascular involvement (86%), conjunctivitis (62%) and respiratory involvement (21%). Some patients had clinical features partially resembling Kawasaki disease (KD), toxic shock syndrome and cytokine storm syndrome. Male gender (69%), black, Asian and other minority ethnicities (BAME, 59%) were over-represented. Immune modulating treatment was used in all, including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), corticosteroids and cytokine blockers. Notably, 32% of patients treated with IVIG alone went into remission. The rest required additional treatment, usually corticosteroids, with the exception of two patients who were treated with TNF inhibition and IL-1 blockade, respectively. Another patient received IL-1 inhibition as primary therapy, with associated rapid and sustained remission. Randomized and prospective studies are needed to investigate efficacy and safety of treatment, especially as resources of IVIG may be depleted secondary to high demand during future waves of COVID-19.","Felsenstein, Susanna; Willis, Emily; Lythgoe, Hannah; McCann, Liza; Cleary, Andrew; Mahmood, Kamran; Porter, David; Jones, Jessica; McDonagh, Janet; Chieng, Alice; Varnier, Giulia; Hughes, Stephen; Boullier, Mary; Ryan, Fiona; Awogbemi, Olumoyin; Soda, Giridhar; Duong, Phuoc; Pain, Clare; Riley, Phil; Hedrich, Christian M.",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9103293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33066459/,247

One potential means of preventing this is for the patent holders to enter into a so-called patent pool, such as those established in the electronics and telecommunications industries. Precedents for these also exist in the field of genetics, notably with the patents pertaining to the SARS genome. In this review, we initially address the patent pool concept in general and its application in genetics. Following this, we will explore patent pools in the diagnostic field in more detail, and examine some existing and novel examples of patent pools in genetics.","Verbeure, Birgit; van Zimmeren, Esther; Matthijs, Gert; Van Overwalle, Geertrui",Trends in Biotechnology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167779906000199; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779906000199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16443296/,247

Owing to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, regular contact with ALS patients at our center was severely restricted and patient care was at risk by delay of supportive therapies. We established a triage system based on the D50 disease progression model and were thus able to identify a prospective cohort with high disease aggressiveness (D50 < 30). Thirty-seven patients with highly aggressive disease were actively offered follow-up, either via telephone or on-site, depending on their disease-specific needs and abilities. We describe here the procedures, obstacles, and results of these prescient efforts during the restrictions caused by COVID-19 in the period between March and June 2020. In conclusion, four patients with highly aggressive disease were initiated with non-invasive ventilation and two received a gastrostomy. We could show that a comparable amount of advanced care was induced in a retrospective cohort within a similar time period one year prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. Our workflow to identify high-risk patients via D50 model metrics can be easily implemented and integrated within existing centers. It helped to maintain a high quality of advanced care planning for our ALS patients.","Steinbach, Robert; Prell, Tino; Gaur, Nayana; Stubendorff, Beatrice; Roediger, Annekathrin; Ilse, Benjamin; Witte, Otto W.; Grosskreutz, Julian",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899481/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9092873,247

We show by qPCR analysis that virus replication is diminished up to four orders of magnitude to background levels. Knockdown of the cellular Cyclophilin A (CypA/PPIA) gene in Caco-2 cells prevents replication of HCoV-NL63, suggesting that CypA is required for virus replication.

Patients and methods Records were retrospectively analysed for 80 patients on SDR not admitted to the hospital due to fear of infection during pandemic, with increased disease activity and were resumed on LDR (500 mg intravenous RTX-infusion twice with 15 days intervals, and repeated for the second time in all patients after 6 months). Disease activity score (DAS-28) values were obtained. The Ig levels of the patients before and after rituximab treatment were calculated. Results The mean age of patients was 55.1±13.1 years. They were 46 (57.5%) female and 34 (42.5%) male (F:M 1.4:1) with median disease duration of 13 (0.5-50) years. After the second dose of LDR, there was a significant decrease in the disease activity DAS28 (6.5±1.01 to 3.2±1.2, p<0.0001) and acute phase reactants with a tendency to decrease in Ig levels. After LDR, 6 (7.5%) patients developed COVID-19 infection that did not require hospitalization. There was no difference between the Ig levels of patients with and without COVID-19 infection. Conclusions LDR is an effective treatment option in the treatment of RA.

677808,Nigella sativa L. as a Potential Phytotherapy for COVID-19: A Mini-Review of In-silico Studies,2020-08-25,"Advances in DNA sequencing technology have significantly impacted human genetics; they have enabled the analysis of genetic causes of rare diseases, which are usually pathogenic variants in a single gene at the nucleotide sequence level. However, since the quantity of data regarding the relationship between genotype and phenotype is insufficient to diagnose some rare immune diseases definitively, genetic information alone cannot help obtain a mechanistic understanding of the disease etiology. For such cases, exploring the molecular phenotype using multiomic analyses could be the approach of choice. In this review, we first overview current technologies for multiomic analysis, particularly focusing on RNA and protein profiling of bulk cell ensembles. We then discuss the measurement modality and granularity issue because it is critical to design multiomic experiments properly. Next, we illustrate the importance of bioimaging by describing our experience with the analysis of an autoinflammatory disease, cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndrome, which could be caused by low-frequency somatic mosaicism and cannot be well characterized only by multiomic snapshot analyses of an ensemble of many immune cells. We found it powerful to complement the multiomic data with bioimaging data that can provide us with indispensable time-specific dynamic information of every single cell in the “immune cell society.” Because we now have many measurement tools in different modalities and granularity to tackle the etiology of rare hereditary immune diseases, we might gain a deeper understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases by taking full advantage of these tools in an integrated manner.","Kawashima, Yusuke; Nishikomori, Ryuta; Ohara, Osamu",Inflamm Regen,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34193319/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41232-021-00169-4,247

This cohort study aimed to compare maternal and fetal consequences of COVID-19 infected with non-infected pregnancies. METHODS: We included pregnant women with and without COVID-19 who were admitted to Arash Hospital in Tehran, Iran from March 1 to Sep 1, 2020. Clinical features, treatments, and maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-nine women enrolled, including 66 COVID-19 infected and 133 non-infected pregnant women prospectively. Caesarean Section (CS) was carried out in total 105 women (52.76%).

678044,Safety issues in selected patients implanted with Boston Scientific EMBLEM subcutaneous cardioverter defibrillator systems.,2021-02-25,"BACKGROUND: The current severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has raised awareness of vaccine hesitancy. Specific reasons for vaccine hesitancy among people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) have not been fully described. Notably, pwMS may experience higher morbidity from vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated warts and malignancies. Furthermore, screening for immunity against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) is not standard practice, despite a resurgence of measles and mumps outbreaks in Europe and worldwide. We aimed to evaluate general vaccination status among pwMS to better inform vaccine practices in this cohort. METHODS: This was a prospective audit of pwMS attending an Irish tertiary referral MS centre. We designed a questionnaire that explored awareness, uptake, and hesitancy for the influenza, pneumococcal, SARS-CoV-2, HPV, and MMR vaccines. The clinician administered the questionnaire during the outpatient MS clinic. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-five pwMS participated in the audit, mean (SD) age 47.3 (12.8) years, mean MS disease duration 14.1 (9.5) years, median Expanded Disability Severity Scale (EDSS) score 2.0 (IQR 1.0-6.0), forty-nine (46.7%) were taking either maintenance immunosuppressive or immune reconstitution therapies. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine willingness among pwMS was higher (90.5% vs 60%-80%) than that reported in other Western countries, and higher than that for the influenza and pneumococcal vaccines (∼80%) for which perceived unnecessity and unfamiliarity respectively were the main limiting factors. The primary reason for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy was safety concern. PwMS who were explicitly advised by a healthcare professional to obtain the influenza vaccine were more likely to do so than those who were not (odds ratio, 8.1, 95% CI 2.8 – 23.4, p<0.001). Of pwMS currently receiving B-cell therapy (ocrelizumab/rituximab, n=12), all but one (n=11, 91.7%) have never received the pneumococcal vaccine, and a quarter (n=3) were uncertain whether to obtain this in the future. Patient-reported uptake of HPV (1.0%) and MMR (51.4%) vaccines were suboptimal. Prevalence of vaccine promotion among healthcare professionals was low (influenza vaccine, 4.8 – 32.4%; pneumococcal vaccine, 0 – 18.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitancy is common (10-20%) in pwMS, consequent to insufficient knowledge and misconceptions about vaccination among pwMS and suboptimal vaccine promotion by healthcare professionals that manage pwMS. Conscientious and context-specific vaccination counselling is necessary to tackle vaccine hesitancy among pwMS, including (i) avoiding infection-associated disability accrual during MS relapses, (ii) reducing the potentially higher risk of life-threatening/treatment-refractory complications that may be observed in those who develop vaccine-preventable infections while receiving certain DMTs, and (iii) avoiding attenuated avoiding attenuated vaccine responses or delayed/interrupted DMT with early pre-treatment vaccine delivery where possible. Appropriateness of vaccine delivery at MS diagnosis/pre-treatment should be further elucidated.","Yap, Siew; Al Hinai, Mahmood; Gaughan, Maria; Callanan, Ian; Kearney, Hugh; Tubridy, Niall; McGuigan, Christopher",Mult Scler Relat Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2021.103236; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034821005034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34507240/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034821005034?v=s5,247

TS-FIPV, unlike its parent strain, DF2 wild type FIPV (WT-FIPV), propagated at 31 °C (permissive temperature) but not at 39 °C (nonpermissive temperature). This temperature preference of TS-FIPV was also demonstrated in cats by the ability of the virus to replicate only at the lower temperature in the upper respiratory tract and not at systemic sites where higher temperatures (38–39 °C) prevail. Viral structural proteins and RNA were synthesized at 39 °C but some undefined maturational defect prevented the formation of infectious TS-FIPV at its nonpermissive temperature. TS-FIPV was more thermolabile than WT-FIPV which indicated alterations in the structural proteins of TS-FIPV, and a difference in the envelope protein of the two viruses was revealed by Western blot analysis. Plaque assay characterization showed that TS-FIPV produced small plaques in comparison to the large plaques of WT-FIPV. These unique characteristics possessed by TS-FIPV may account for its nonvirulent nature and ability to stimulate protective immune responses in cats.","Christianson, K. K.; Ingersoll, J.

With a broad range of health indicators, life expectancy (ranging from 53 years to 73 years), and mortality rate in children younger than 5 years (ranging from 10·3 to 44·6 deaths per 1000 livebirths), a review of progress in each of the BRICS countries shows that each has some way to go before achieving UHC. The BRICS countries show substantial, and often similar, challenges in moving towards UHC. On the basis of a review of each country, the most pressing problems are: raising insufficient public spending; stewarding mixed private and public health systems; ensuring equity; meeting the demands for more human resources; managing changing demographics and disease burdens; and addressing the social determinants of health. Increases in public funding can be used to show how BRICS health ministries could accelerate progress to achieve UHC. Although all the BRICS countries have devoted increased resources to health, the biggest increase has been in China, which was probably facilitated by China's rapid economic growth. However, the BRICS country with the second highest economic growth, India, has had the least improvement in public funding for health. Future research to understand such different levels of prioritisation of the health sector in these countries could be useful. Similarly, the role of strategic purchasing in working with powerful private sectors, the effect of federal structures, and the implications of investment in primary health care as a foundation for UHC could be explored. These issues could serve as the basis on which BRICS countries focus their efforts to share ideas and strategies.","Marten, Robert; McIntyre, Diane; Travassos, Claudia; Shishkin, Sergey; Longde, Wang; Reddy, Srinath; Vega, Jeanette",Lancet,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(14)60075-1; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673614600751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793339/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673614600751,247
680452,Micronutrients as immunomodulatory tools for COVID-19 management,2020-07-22,"Multiple promising COVID-19 vaccines are under rapid development, with deployment of the initial supply expected by 2021. Careful design of a vaccine prioritization strategy across socio-demographic groups is an imminent and crucial public policy challenge given that (1) the eventual vaccine supply will be highly constrained for at least the first several months of the vaccination campaign, and (2) there are stark differences in transmission and severity of impacts from SARS-CoV-2 across groups. Previous experience with vaccine development mid-pandemic offers limited insights for SARS-CoV-2 prioritization: SARS and Zika vaccine development was incomplete when those outbreaks ended and the epidemiology of endemic human influenza viruses differ substantially from that of SARS-CoV-2. We assess the optimal allocation of a limited and dynamic COVID-19 vaccine supply in the U.S. across socio-demographic groups differentiated by age and essential worker status. The transmission dynamics are modeled using a compartmental (SEIR) model parameterized to capture our current understanding of the transmission and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, including key sources of group heterogeneity (susceptibility, severity, and contact rates). We investigate tradeoffs between three alternative policy objectives: minimizing infections, years of life lost, or deaths. Moreover, we model dynamic vaccine prioritization policies that respond to changes in the epidemiological status of the population as SARS-CoV-2 continues its march. Because contacts tend to be concentrated within age groups, there is diminishing marginal returns as vaccination coverage increases in a given group, increasing the group’s protective immunity against infection and mortality. We find that optimal prioritization consistently targets older essential workers. However, depending on the policy objective, younger essential workers are prioritized to minimize infections or seniors in order to minimize mortality. Optimal prioritization outperforms non-targeted vaccination strategies by up to 18% depending on the outcome optimized. For example, in our baseline model, cumulative mortality decreased on average by 17% (25,000 deaths in the U.S. population) over the course of the outbreak.","Buckner, Jack H.; Chowell, Gerardo; Springborn, Michael R.",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199174v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32995816/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.22.20199174,247

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in April 2020. Participants of Chinese nationality aged ⩾ 18 years were asked to complete a modified validated Chinese version of a questionnaire regarding the impact of event scale (IES), family and social support, mental health–related lifestyle changes, and indicators of negative mental health impacts. RESULTS: A total of 728 participants (i.e., 217 males and 511 females) completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 32.9 ± 10.4 years, with a majority of them (92.2%) having a higher educational qualification level. The overall mean IES in participants was 21.5 ± 7.0, reflecting mild stressful impact (i.e., following the re-opening of the Wuhan city); 25.5% of the participants had an IES score ⩾ 26. Being females and married were significantly associated with a higher mean IES score. The overall mean scores for intrusion and avoidance score scales in participants were 9.4 ± 3.7 and 12.1 ± 4.2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased stressful impact in our participants following the re-opening of the Wuhan city when compared with our previous study, which should not be taken lightly.","Ma, Zheng Feei; Zhang, Yutong; Luo, Xiaoqin; Li, Xinli; Li, Yeshan; Liu, Shuchang; Zhang, Yingfei",Int J Soc Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32564637/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020935489,247
680711,Covid-19 à Mayotte : profil épidémiologique d’une année de crise,2021-08-31,"BACKGROUND: Metastasis and invasion are crucial in determining the mortality of cervical carcinoma (CC) patients. The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is now a universal explanation for the mechanisms of tumor metastasis. Α-chimeric protein (α-chimaerin, CHN1) plays an important role in the regulation of signal transduction and development. However, the molecular regulatory relationships between CHN1 and CC progression in relation to EMT have not yet been identified. METHODS: The expression of CHN1 in CC tissues, adjacent tissues, and lymph node metastases from CC patients was detected by immunohistochemistry. Upregulation and knockdown of CHN1 were achieved by transfection of CC cells. The effect of CHN1 on cell proliferation was determined by CCK-8 and plate clone formation assays. Changes in migration and invasion capabilities were evaluated using scratch migration and transwell invasion assays. The effect of CHN1 overexpression and interference on xenograft tumor growth was determined by tumor weight and pathological analyses. The expression of EMT-related mRNAs was measured by qRT-PCR in transfected CC cells. EMT-related proteins and Akt/GSK-3β/Snail signaling pathway-related proteins were also evaluated by western blotting. RESULTS: CHN1 was overexpressed in CC tissues and was associated with lymph node metastasis and low survival in CC patients. Overexpression of CHN1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in CC cells. In contrast, silencing of CHN1 inhibited these phenomena. Overexpression of CHN1 promoted tumor formation in an in vivo xenograft tumor mouse model, with increased tumor volumes and weights. In addition, CHN1 induced the expression of EMT-related transcription factors, accompanied by the decreased expression of epithelial markers and increased expression of mesenchymal markers. The Akt/GSK-3β/Snail signaling pathway was activated by overexpression of CHN1 in vitro, and activation of this pathway was inhibited by the signaling pathway inhibitor LY294002. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CHN1 promotes the development and progression of cervical carcinoma via the Akt/GSK-3β/Snail pathway by inducing EMT.

682582,Low-Level Laser Therapy in Prevention of the Development of Endothelial Dysfunction and Clinical Experience of Treatment and Rehabilitation of COVID-19 Patients,2021-01-26,"The novel emerged SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread around the world causing acute infection of the respiratory tract (COVID-19) that can result in severe disease and lethality. For SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, its surface glycoprotein spike (S) must be cleaved at two different sites by host cell proteases, which therefore represent potential drug targets. In the present study, we show that S can be cleaved by the proprotein convertase furin at the S1/S2 site and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) at the S2′ site. We demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is essential for activation of SARS-CoV-2 S in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells through antisense-mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 replication was also strongly inhibited by the synthetic furin inhibitor MI-1851 in human airway cells. In contrast, inhibition of endosomal cathepsins by E64d did not affect virus replication. Combining various TMPRSS2 inhibitors with furin inhibitor MI-1851 produced more potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 than an equimolar amount of any single serine protease inhibitor. Therefore, this approach has considerable therapeutic potential for treatment of COVID-19.","Bestle, Dorothea; Heindl, Miriam Ruth; Limburg, Hannah; Van Lam van, Thuy; Pilgram, Oliver; Moulton, Hong; Stein, David A; Hardes, Kornelia; Eickmann, Markus; Dolnik, Olga; Rohde, Cornelius; Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Garten, Wolfgang; Steinmetzer, Torsten; Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, Eva",Life Sci Alliance,https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202000786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32703818/,247

Patients and Methods A systematic review was conducted by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the preprint server MedRxiv until 11 May 2020 using the terms ‘anosmia’ or ‘hyposmia’ or ‘dysosmia’ or ‘olfactory dysfunction’ or ‘olfaction disorder’ or ‘smell dysfunction’ or ‘ageusia’ or ‘hypogeusia’ or ‘dysgeusia’ or ‘taste dysfunction’ or ‘gustatory dysfunction’ or ‘neurological’ and ‘COVID-19’ or ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV’ or ‘SARS-CoV-2’. References of included studies were also manually screened. Only studies involving diagnostic-confirmed patients with COVID-19 were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Results A total of twenty-four studies with data from 8438 test-confirmed COVID-19 patients from thirteen countries were included. The pooled proportion of patients presenting with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions was 41.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 28.5% to 53.9) and 38.2% (95% CI 24.0 to 53.6%), respectively. Increasing mean age correlated with lower prevalence of olfactory (coefficient = -0.076; p=.02) and gustatory (coefficient = -0.073; p=.03) dysfunctions. There was a higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunctions with the use of objective measurements compared to self-reports (coefficient = 2.33; p=.01). No significant moderation of the prevalence of OGDs by gender was observed. Conclusion There is a high prevalence of OGDs among patients infected with COVID-19. Routine screening for these conditions could contribute to improved case detection in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

683431,Active smoking and severity of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients,2020-09-30,"CONTEXT: Limited access to opioids for cancer patients has been reported as a potential unintended consequence of recent regulations restricting opioid use and prescribing practices. To our knowledge, there are a limited number of peer-reviewed studies that evaluate cancer patients’ perceived difficulties when filling their opioid prescription. To understand these difficulties, we surveyed patients receiving opioids in our outpatient Supportive Care Center (SCC). OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate cancer patients’ perceptions of overall difficulties when filling their opioid prescription. Secondary objectives included determining associations between patient characteristics and difficulty, and comparing difficulty between filling opioid and non-opioid prescriptions. METHODS: Cancer patients receiving opioids that had been seen two times or more at our SCC were asked to complete a survey. The information collected included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and patients’ experiences filling their opioid prescription. RESULTS: The patients’ median age was 60 years; 54% were female and 69% were white. Forty-four patients (32%) reported that they have experienced difficulty filling their opioid prescription. More than 25% of those 44 patients perceived difficulty from interactions with the pharmacy/pharmacist. Forty-six patients (33%) reported more difficulty filling their opioid prescriptions than filling their non-opioid prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that patients with cancer visiting our SCC perceived difficulties obtaining their opioid prescriptions. The results suggest that negative interactions with the pharmacy/pharmacist contributes to their perceived difficulty. Additional research is needed to further characterize the contributors of the difficulties cancer patients face in filling their opioid prescriptions.","Brown, Jessica H.; Torres, Hilda P.; Maddi, Rama D.; Williams, Janet L.; Dibaj, Seyedeh S.; Liu, Diane; Bruera, Eduardo",J Pain Symptom Manage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32569832/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392420305273?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.06.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0885392420305273,247
683694,Terminal complement inhibition dampens the inflammation during COVID‐19,2020-06-04,"Infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 can result in severe respiratory complications and death. Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specifically, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NFκB, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic. Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.","Sawalha, Amr H.; Zhao, Ming; Coit, Patrick; Lu, Qianjin",Clin Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1521661620302394; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521661620302394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32276140/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108410,247

METHODS: A prospective randomized open-label study was designed to identify differences in the fitting performance between mask wearing methods in three different types of KF94 mask with ear loops between January to March 2021. General-fitting involved wearing an ear-loop-type KF94 mask, and tight-fitting involved wearing a mask aided by a clip connecting the ear loops. Each of the 30 participants wore three types of masks according to a randomly assigned order in both methods and performed a total of six quantitative fit tests (QNFTs) according to the occupational safety and health administration protocol. RESULTS: All fit factors (FFs) measured by the QNFT were significantly higher for tight-fitting method with the clip in all KF94 masks (P < 0.001). However, the total FFs were very low, with a median (interquartile range) of 6 (3–23) and 29 (9–116) for general-fitting and tight-fitting, respectively. When wearing tightly, the horizontal 3-fold type mask with adjustable ear-loop length had the highest FF, with a median of 125, and the QNFT pass rate (FF ≥ 100) increased significantly from 4 (13%) to 18 (60%). CONCLUSION: Even with sufficient filter efficiency, ear-loop-type-KF94 masks do not provide adequate protection.

This study was conducted to investigate whether proximity to railway stations, a proxy for utilization, was associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection across small-areas of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (Portugal). Methods: The number of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infections from March 2 until July 5, 2020 at the parish-level was obtained from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System. A Geographic Information System was used to estimate proximity to railway stations of the six railway lines operating in the area. A quasi-Poisson generalized linear regression model was fitted to estimate the relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: Between May 2 and July 5, 2020, there were a total of 17,168 SARS-CoV-2 infections in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, with wide disparities between parishes. Overall, parishes near any of the railway stations of the Sintra line presented significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 infection rates (RR = 1.42, 95%CI 1.16, 1.75) compared to parishes located farther away from railway stations, while the opposite was observed for parishes near other railway stations (Sado and Fertagus lines), where infection rates were significantly lower than those observed in parishes located farther away from railway stations (RR = 0.66, 95%CI 0.50, 0.87). The associations varied according to the stage of the epidemic and to the mitigation measures enforced. Regression results also revealed an increasing influence of socioeconomic deprivation on SARS-CoV-2 infections. Conclusions: No consistent association between proximity to railway stations and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in the most affected metropolitan area of Portugal was observed, suggesting that other factors (e.g., socioeconomic deprivation) may play a more prominent role in the epidemic dynamics.","Severo, Milton; Ribeiro, Ana Isabel; Lucas, Raquel; Leão, Teresa; Barros, Henrique",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.611565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614581/,247

Data remain scarce on COVID-19 outcomes in paediatric RD patients. The aim of this study is to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and to describe COVID-19 outcomes in immunosuppressed paediatric RD patients. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with RD before age 18 and treated with at least one immunosuppressive medication for at least three months were enrolled from a tertiary paediatric rheumatology practice in New York, and also underwent routine SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing from May to November 2020. Five hundred and seventy-one patients were screened and 262 were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ subjects were assessed for symptoms of COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 PCR results were recorded where available. Demographic, diagnostic, medication, and outcome data were collected. RESULTS: Of 262 subjects (186 female), 35 (13%) were SARS-CoV-2 IgG+; 17 (49%) had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Of 17 patients who had SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, 11 (65%) were PCR+; seven of whom were IgG+. Most SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ subjects were not PCR tested. The most common symptoms in IgG+ and/or PCR+ subjects were fever, fatigue, and cough. No SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ or PCR+ subject developed severe or critical COVID-19 or required hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in a large cohort of paediatric RD patients. Most SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ subjects had no symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Symptomatic subjects all had mild COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting that risk of severe or critical COVID-19 in immunosuppressed paediatric RD patients is minimal.","Walters, Heather M; Mian, Zanab; Thomas, Lydia; Cerise, Jane; Eberhard, B Anne; Pagano, Eileen; Gottlieb, Beth S; Steigerwald, Katherine; Hui-Yuen, Joyce S",Rheumatology (Oxford),https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keab730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34599820/,247

Here, we analyzed genes encoding selected natural killer cell receptors with a special focus on genes encoding receptors for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands in the two domestic camel species, Camelus dromedarius and Camelus bactrianus. Based on the dromedary genome assembly CamDro2, we characterized the genetic contents, organization, and variability of two complex genomic regions, the leukocyte receptor complex and the natural killer complex, along with the natural cytotoxicity receptor genes NCR1, NCR2, and NCR3. The genomic organization of the natural killer complex region of camels differs from cattle, the phylogenetically most closely related species. With its minimal set of KLR genes, it resembles this complex in the domestic pig. Similarly, the leukocyte receptor complex of camels is strikingly different from its cattle counterpart. With KIR pseudogenes and few LILR genes, it seems to be simpler than in the pig. The syntenies and protein sequences of the NCR1, NCR2, and NCR3 genes in the dromedary suggest that they could be human orthologues. However, only NCR1 and NCR2 have a structure of functional genes, while NCR3 appears to be a pseudogene. High sequence similarities between the two camel species as well as with the alpaca Vicugna pacos were observed. The polymorphism in all genes analyzed seems to be generally low, similar to the rest of the camel genomes. This first report on natural killer cell receptor genes in camelids adds new data to our understanding of specificities of the camel immune system and its functions, extends our genetic knowledge of the innate immune variation in dromedaries and Bactrian camels, and contributes to studies of natural killer cell receptors evolution in mammals.","Futas, Jan; Oppelt, Jan; Jelinek, April; Elbers, Jean P.; Wijacki, Jan; Knoll, Ales; Burger, Pamela A.; Horin, Petr",Front Genet,https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2019.00620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312212/,247

The association SARS-CoV with aberrant cytokine, chemokine, and Interferon Stimulated Gene (ISG) responses in patients provided evidence that SARS-CoV pathogenesis is at least partially controlled by innate immune signaling. Utilizing models for SARS-CoV infection, key components of innate immune signaling pathways have been identified as protective factors against SARS-CoV disease, including STAT1 and MyD88. Gene transcription signatures unique to SARS-CoV disease states have been identified, but host factors that regulate exacerbated disease phenotypes still remain largely undetermined. SARS-CoV encodes several proteins that modulate innate immune signaling through the antagonism of the induction of Interferon and by avoidance of ISG effector functions.","Totura, Allison L; Baric, Ralph S",Curr Opin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2012.04.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22572391/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625712000715; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625712000715,247

To prepare for a pandemic, hospitals need a strategy to manage their space, staff, and supplies so that optimum care is provided to patients. In addition, infection prevention measures need to be implemented to reduce in-hospital transmission. In the operating room, these preparations involve multiple stakeholders and can present a significant challenge. Here, we describe the outbreak response measures of the anesthetic department staffing the largest (1,700-bed) academic tertiary level acute care hospital in Singapore (Singapore General Hospital) and a smaller regional hospital (Sengkang General Hospital). These include engineering controls such as identification and preparation of an isolation operating room, administrative measures such as modification of workflow and processes, introduction of personal protective equipment for staff, and formulation of clinical guidelines for anesthetic management. Simulation was valuable in evaluating the feasibility of new operating room set-ups or workflow. We also discuss how the hierarchy of controls can be used as a framework to plan the necessary measures during each phase of a pandemic, and review the evidence for the measures taken. These containment measures are necessary to optimize the quality of care provided to COVID-19 patients and to reduce the risk of viral transmission to other patients or healthcare workers.","Wong, Jolin; Goh, Qing Yuan; Tan, Zihui; Lie, Sui An; Tay, Yoong Chuan; Ng, Shin Yi; Soh, Chai Rick",Can J Anaesth,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01620-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32162212/,247

685601,Reply: Potential Use of Radiolabeled Antibodies for Imaging and Treatment of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The infection caused by the recently identified SARS‐CoV‐2, called COronaVIrus Disease‐19 (COVID‐19), has rapidly spread throughout the world. With the exponential increase of patients worldwide, the clinical spectrum of COVID‐19 is being better defined and new symptoms are emerging. Numerous reports are documenting the occurrence of different cutaneous manifestations in COVID‐19 patients. OBJECTIVES: To provide a brief overview of the COVID‐19‐associated cutaneous lesions. METHODS: Literature search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases up to 30 April 2020. This narrative review summarizes the available data regarding clinical and histological features of COVID‐19‐associated skin manifestations. RESULTS: Literature reports showed a great heterogeneity in COVID‐19‐associated cutaneous manifestations, as well as in their latency periods and associated extracutaneous symptoms. Pathogenic mechanisms are unknown, although the role of hyperactive immune response, complement activation and microvascular injury has been hypothesized. Based on our experience and the literature data, we subdivided the reported cutaneous lesions into six main clinical patterns: i) urticarial rash, ii) confluent erythematous/maculo‐papular/morbilliform rash, iii) papulovesicular exanthem, iv) chilblain‐like acral pattern, v) livedo reticularis/racemosa‐like pattern, vi) purpuric “vasculitic” pattern. These six patterns can be merged into two main settings: the first one – inflammatory/exanthematous – including the first three groups cited above and the second one including the vasculopathic/vasculitic lesions of the last three aforementioned groups. CONCLUSIONS: The possible presence of cutaneous findings leading to suspect COVID‐19 puts dermatologists in a relevant position. Further studies are needed to delineate the diagnostic and prognostic value of such cutaneous manifestations.","Marzano, A.V.; Cassano, N.; Genovese, G.; Moltrasio, C.; Vena, G.A.",Br J Dermatol,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.19264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32479680/,247

Several cellular studies have investigated the effects of vitamin D metabolites on immune responses to respiratory viruses, but syntheses of these reports are lacking. Scope: In this article, we review the literature reporting results of in vitro experiments investigating immunomodulatory actions of vitamin D metabolites in human respiratory epithelial cells infected with respiratory viruses. Key findings: Vitamin D metabolites do not consistently influence replication or clearance of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or influenza A virus in human respiratory epithelial cell culture, although they do modulate expression and secretion of type 1 interferon, chemokines including CXCL8 and CXCL10 and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-6. Future research: More studies are needed to clarify the effects of vitamin D metabolites on respiratory virus-induced expression of cell surface markers mediating viral entry and bacterial adhesion to respiratory epithelial cells.","Greiller, Claire L.; Martineau, Adrian R.",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu7064240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26035247/,247

The clinical course of the disease in children and infants is milder than in adults. It should be noted that, although typical symptoms may be present in children, non-specific symptoms could be noted in the neonate. The disease is rare in the neonate, so, its suspicion in this group can help to make a quick diagnose. Case report: A 15-day-old neonate was admitted with fever, lethargy, cutaneous mottling, and respiratory distress without cough. His mother had symptoms of Novel coronavirus. So Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay was done for the neonate and showed to be positive. The newborn was isolated and subjected to supportive care. Antibiotic and antiviral treatment was initiated. Eventually, the baby was discharged in good general condition. Conclusion: When a newborn presents with non-specific symptoms of infection with an added history of COVID-19 in his/her parents, it indicates the need for PCR testing for Novel coronavirus.","Kamali Aghdam, Mojtaba; Jafari, Nahid; Eftekhari, Kambiz",Infect Dis (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32233816/; https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2020.1747634,247

We propose a mechanistic understanding of human–reservoir interactions, using hantavirus pulmonary syndrome as a case study. Crucial processes underpinning the disease's incidence remain poorly studied, including the connectivity among natural and peridomestic deer mouse host activity, virus transmission, and human exposure. We found that disease cases were greatest in arid states and declined exponentially with increasing precipitation. Within arid environments, relatively rare climatic conditions (e.g., El Niño) are associated with increased rainfall and reservoir abundance, producing more frequent virus transmission and host dispersal. We suggest that deer mice increase their occupancy of peridomestic structures during spring–summer, amplifying intraspecific transmission and human infection risk. Disease incidence in arid states may increase with predicted climatic changes. Mechanistic approaches incorporating reservoir behavior, reservoir–human interactions, and pathogen spillover could enhance our understanding of global hantavirus ecology, with applications to other directly transmitted zoonoses.","Carver, Scott; Mills, James N.; Parmenter, Cheryl A.; Parmenter, Robert R.; Richardson, Kyle S.; Harris, Rachel L.; Douglass, Richard J.; Kuenzi, Amy J.; Luis, Angela D.",BioScience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26955081/; https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-pdf/65/7/651/16648355/biv047.pdf,247
686181,Effects of inhaled nitric oxide in COVID‐19‐induced ARDS—Is it worthwhile?,2021-08-12,"We compared the electrostatic properties of the spike proteins (S-proteins) of three coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, and their interactions with photosensitizers (PSs), octacationic octakis(cholinyl)zinc phthalocyanine (Zn-PcChol(8+)) and monocationic methylene blue (MB). We found a major common PS binding site at the connection of the S-protein stalk and head. The molecules of Zn-PcChol(8+) and MB also form electrostatic encounter complexes with large area of negative electrostatic potential at the head of the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, between fusion protein and heptad repeat 1 domain. The top of the SARS-CoV spike head demonstrates a notable area of electrostatic contacts with Zn-PcChol(8+) and MB that corresponds to the N-terminal domain. The S-protein protomers of SARS-CoV-2 in “open” and “closed” conformations demonstrate different ability to attract PS molecules. In contrast with Zn-PcChol(8+), MB possesses the ability to penetrate inside the pocket formed as a result of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain transition into the “open” state. The existence of binding site for cationic PSs common to the S-proteins of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV creates prospects for the wide use of this type of PSs to combat the spread of coronaviruses.","Fedorov, Vladimir; Kholina, Ekaterina; Khruschev, Sergei; Kovalenko, Ilya; Rubin, Andrew; Strakhovskaya, Marina",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452480/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081615,247

689293,"Clinical characteristics of vulnerable populations hospitalized and diagnosed with COVID-19 in Buenos Aires, Argentina",2021-05-06,"BACKGROUND: Mobile phones are widely used in hospital settings for different purposes. Mobile phones of healthcare workers (HCWs) could be colonized or harbor extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing gram-negative bacteria and may act as source of infectious agents. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria on mobile phones of healthcare workers, to assess their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and associated factors. METHODS: A laboratory-based cross-sectional study was conducted involving a total of 572 samples by rubbing swabs of the front screen, back, keypad, and metallic surfaces of mobile phones of healthcare workers using simple random sampling technique. All specimens were screened for ESBL using ESBL CHROME agar and confirmed using double-disk diffusion test (DDDT). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by the Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion technique on Mueller–Hinton agar. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25, odds ratio and p-value was calculated to determine the association among variables. RESULTS: Overall, the number of mobile phones contaminated by gram-negative bacteria was 454 out of 572 (79.4%). Female sex (OR 0.651, p-value=0.039) and service year (OR 0.468, p-value=0.038) of healthcare workers were found to be the most significant factors associated with healthcare professionals’ mobile phone and bacterial contamination. Nine percent of the isolates were ESBL-producers. K. pneumoniae (27%) was the dominant ESBL-producing isolate followed by Acinetobacter spp. (14.5%) and E.coli (14.5%). ESBL-producers were highly resistant to ampicillin (95.8%), piperacillin (83.3%), cotrimoxazole (70.8%), and chloramphenicol (54.2%), but highly sensitive to meropenem (87.5%), amikacin (85.4%), and piperacillin-tazobactam (81.2%). CONCLUSION: ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 8.3% of HCWs’ mobile phones. As high as 79.4% of the isolates were multidrug resistant. Mobile phones can lead to bacterial cross-contamination and could be a source of nosocomial infections.","Araya, Shambel; Desta, Kassu; Woldeamanuel, Yimtubezinash",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s291876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33531847/,247

Respiratory infection transmission via the eye and lacrimal-nasal pathway elucidated during the 1918 influenza pandemic, remains to be explored in this crisis. The eye and its adnexae represent a large surface area directly exposed to airborne viral particles and hand contact. The virus may bind to corneal and conjunctival angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and potentially to the lipophilic periocular skin and superficial tear film with downstream carriage into the nasopharynx and subsequent access to the lungs and gut. Adenoviruses and influenza viruses share this ocular tropism and despite differing ocular and systemic manifestations and disease patterns, common lessons, particularly in management, emerge. Slit lamp usage places ophthalmologists at particular risk of exposure to high viral loads (and poor prognosis) and as for adenoviral epidemics, this may be a setting for disease transmission. Local, rather than systemic treatments blocking virus binding in this pathway (advocated for adenovirus) are worth considering. This pathway is accessible with eye drops or aerosols containing drugs which appear efficacious via systemic administration. A combination such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc, all of which have previously been used topically in the eye and which work at least in part by blocking ACE2 receptors, may offer a safe, cost-effective and resource-sparing intervention.","Theodore Coroneo, Minas",Ocul Surf,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542012420300896?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1542012420300896; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32446866/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtos.2020.05.011,247

À cette occasion sont réapparues les peurs antiques concernant l’apparition d’un agent infectieux hautement pathogène, pouvant provoquer des épidémies associées à une mortalité élevée. Ces phénomènes sont clairement des menaces à répétition. L’analyse des mécanismes ayant permis l’apparition de ces virus montre que pour chaque virus émergent décrit, il ne s’agit en aucun cas de phénomènes purement aléatoires, mais bien de l’accumulation de facteurs qui permettent à ces agents infectieux de diffuser de l’animal vers l’homme. Différents modes d’infection existent, soit par transmission directe, soit par l’intermédiaire des vecteurs (moustiques, tiques ou autres animaux). La conjonction de facteurs écologiques, économiques et épidémiologiques font que ces épidémies naissent et éventuellement diffusent. Grâce au développement des réseaux de surveillance et à l’amélioration des techniques diagnostiques, les virus responsables de ces épidémies sont mieux identifiés. Les expériences récentes du SRAS et de la grippe aviaire en sont les meilleurs exemples. Abstract Emergent viruses have attracted attention during years 2003 and 2004. Ancient fears have reappeared regarding pathogenic agents, capable to result in epidemics with high mortality rates. Such events constitute really repeated threats. The analysis of mechanisms permitting emergence of these viruses has shown that they are not random phenomenons, but they result from accumulated factors leading to transmission from animals to men. Several modes of transmission of infection include: either direct transmission, or by intermediate vectors (mosquitoes, ticks and other (mammals) animals). Convergence of ecologic, economic and epidemiologic factors confer to the epidemics potential ability do spread widely. With the development of surveillance networks and improvement in diagnostic technologies, these “new” viruses are better identified. Recent occurrence of SARS and of the avian influenza are best examples of such experiences.","Lina, B.",Antibiotiques,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S129455010580175X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S129455010580175X,247

Using the 2019 Metro Atlanta Speaks survey, we find that high-income residents and residents with a graduate or a professional degree did not perceive automation as a threat to their jobs, but relatively older residents, blacks or African Americans, and low-income residents perceived automation as a threat to their jobs. Although Hispanics or Latinos and less-educated residents are identified to be more vulnerable to automation, they did not perceive automation as a threat to their jobs. Hence, automation is most likely to make Hispanics or Latinos and less-educated residents unemployed in metro Atlanta as they do not perceive automation as a threat to their jobs despite being deemed more vulnerable to automation.","Ghimire, Ramesh; Skinner, Jim; Carnathan, Mike",Technol Soc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X2030066X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160791X2030066X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904576/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101368,247
