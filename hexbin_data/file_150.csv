317,A large and accurate collection of peptidase cleavages in the MEROPS database,2009-11-02,"Peptidases are enzymes that hydrolyse peptide bonds in proteins and peptides. Peptidases are important in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, tumour and parasite invasion, and for processing viral polyproteins. The MEROPS database is an Internet resource containing information on peptidases, their substrates and inhibitors. The database now includes details of cleavage positions in substrates, both physiological and non-physiological, natural and synthetic. There are 39 118 cleavages in the collection; including 34 606 from a total of 10 513 different proteins and 2677 cleavages in synthetic substrates. The number of cleavages designated as ‘physiological’ is 13 307. The data are derived from 6095 publications. At least one substrate cleavage is known for 45% of the 2415 different peptidases recognized in the MEROPS database. The website now has three new displays: two showing peptidase specificity as a logo and a frequency matrix, the third showing a dynamically generated alignment between each protein substrate and its most closely related homologues. Many of the proteins described in the literature as peptidase substrates have been studied only in vitro. On the assumption that a physiologically relevant cleavage site would be conserved between species, the conservation of every site in terms of peptidase preference has been examined and a number have been identified that are not conserved. There are a number of cogent reasons why a site might not be conserved. Each poorly conserved site has been examined and a reason postulated. Some sites are identified that are very poorly conserved where cleavage is more likely to be fortuitous than of physiological relevance. This data-set is freely available via the Internet and is a useful training set for algorithms to predict substrates for peptidases and cleavage positions within those substrates. The data may also be useful for the design of inhibitors and for engineering novel specificities into peptidases.

630,Delivery Systems for Intradermal Vaccination,2011-04-07,"Intradermal (ID) vaccination can offer improved immunity and simpler logistics of delivery, but its use in medicine is limited by the need for simple, reliable methods of ID delivery. ID injection by the Mantoux technique requires special training and may not reliably target skin, but is nonetheless used currently for BCG and rabies vaccination. Scarification using a bifurcated needle was extensively used for smallpox eradication, but provides variable and inefficient delivery into the skin. Recently, ID vaccination has been simplified by introduction of a simple-to-use hollow microneedle that has been approved for ID injection of influenza vaccine in Europe. Various designs of hollow microneedles have been studied preclinically and in humans. Vaccines can also be injected into skin using needle-free devices, such as jet injection, which is receiving renewed clinical attention for ID vaccination. Projectile delivery using powder and gold particles (i.e., gene gun) have also been used clinically for ID vaccination. Building off the scarification approach, a number of preclinical studies have examined solid microneedle patches for use with vaccine coated onto metal microneedles, encapsulated within dissolving microneedles or added topically to skin after microneedle pretreatment, as well as adapting tattoo guns for ID vaccination. Finally, technologies designed to increase skin permeability in combination with a vaccine patch have been studied through the use of skin abrasion, ultrasound, electroporation, chemical enhancers, and thermal ablation. The prospects for bringing ID vaccination into more widespread clinical practice are encouraging, given the large number of technologies for ID delivery under development.","Kim, Y.

690,Neighborhood Properties Are Important Determinants of Temperature Sensitive Mutations,2011-12-02,"Temperature-sensitive (TS) mutants are powerful tools to study gene function in vivo. These mutants exhibit wild-type activity at permissive temperatures and reduced activity at restrictive temperatures. Although random mutagenesis can be used to generate TS mutants, the procedure is laborious and unfeasible in multicellular organisms. Further, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the TS phenotype are poorly understood. To elucidate TS mechanisms, we used a machine learning method–logistic regression–to investigate a large number of sequence and structure features. We developed and tested 133 features, describing properties of either the mutation site or the mutation site neighborhood. We defined three types of neighborhood using sequence distance, Euclidean distance, and topological distance. We discovered that neighborhood features outperformed mutation site features in predicting TS mutations. The most predictive features suggest that TS mutations tend to occur at buried and rigid residues, and are located at conserved protein domains. The environment of a buried residue often determines the overall structural stability of a protein, thus may lead to reversible activity change upon temperature switch. We developed TS prediction models based on logistic regression and the Lasso regularized procedure. Through a ten-fold cross-validation, we obtained the area under the curve of 0.91 for the model using both sequence and structure features. Testing on independent datasets suggested that the model predicted TS mutations with a 50% precision. In summary, our study elucidated the molecular basis of TS mutants and suggested the importance of neighborhood properties in determining TS mutations. We further developed models to predict TS mutations derived from single amino acid substitutions. In this way, TS mutants can be efficiently obtained through experimentally introducing the predicted mutations.","Lockwood, Svetlana; Krishnamoorthy, Bala; Ye, Ping",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229608/,150
714,Predicting Biological Functions of Compounds Based on Chemical-Chemical Interactions,2011-12-29,"Given a compound, how can we effectively predict its biological function? It is a fundamentally important problem because the information thus obtained may benefit the understanding of many basic biological processes and provide useful clues for drug design. In this study, based on the information of chemical-chemical interactions, a novel method was developed that can be used to identify which of the following eleven metabolic pathway classes a query compound may be involved with: (1) Carbohydrate Metabolism, (2) Energy Metabolism, (3) Lipid Metabolism, (4) Nucleotide Metabolism, (5) Amino Acid Metabolism, (6) Metabolism of Other Amino Acids, (7) Glycan Biosynthesis and Metabolism, (8) Metabolism of Cofactors and Vitamins, (9) Metabolism of Terpenoids and Polyketides, (10) Biosynthesis of Other Secondary Metabolites, (11) Xenobiotics Biodegradation and Metabolism. It was observed that the overall success rate obtained by the method via the 5-fold cross-validation test on a benchmark dataset consisting of 3,137 compounds was 77.97%, which is much higher than 10.45%, the corresponding success rate obtained by the random guesses. Besides, to deal with the situation that some compounds may be involved with more than one metabolic pathway class, the method presented here is featured by the capacity able to provide a series of potential metabolic pathway classes ranked according to the descending order of their likelihood for each of the query compounds concerned. Furthermore, our method was also applied to predict 5,549 compounds whose metabolic pathway classes are unknown. Interestingly, the results thus obtained are quite consistent with the deductions from the reports by other investigators. It is anticipated that, with the continuous increase of the chemical-chemical interaction data, the current method will be further enhanced in its power and accuracy, so as to become a useful complementary vehicle in annotating uncharacterized compounds for their biological functions.","Hu, Le-Le; Chen, Chen; Huang, Tao; Cai, Yu-Dong; Chou, Kuo-Chen",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3248422/,150
765,Design and management of an orthopaedic bone bank in the Netherlands,2010-11-13,"The design and management of an orthopaedic bone bank is a complex process in which medical organisation and legislation intertwine. Neither in the Netherlands, nor in any other European country, there are official guidelines for the organisation and management of an orthopaedic bone bank. In the Netherlands, the recently modified ‘law of security and quality for using human materials’ (WVKL) dictates requirements for technical and organisational aspects for the use of human tissue and cells. The bone bank procedures include a thorough questionnaire for donor selection, extensive serological, bacteriological and histopathological examination, as well as standard procedures for registration, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of bone allografts. This article describes the organisation of an accredited bone bank and can be used as a proposition for an official guideline or can be useful as an example for other orthopaedic bone banks in Europe.","Zwitser, Eline W.; Jiya, Timothy U.; George Licher, H.; van Royen, Barend J.",Cell Tissue Bank,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3286502/,150
792,"Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 among Quarantined Close Contacts, Beijing, People’s Republic of China",2011-10-11,"We estimated the attack rate of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and assessed risk factors for infection among close contacts quarantined in Beijing, People’s Republic of China. The first 613 confirmed cases detected between May 16 and September 15, 2009, were investigated; 7,099 close contacts were located and quarantined. The attack rate of confirmed infection in close contacts was 2.4% overall, ranging from 0.9% among aircraft passengers to >5% among household members. Risk factors for infection among close contacts were younger age, being a household member of an index case-patient, exposure during the index case-patient’s symptomatic phase, and longer exposure. Among close contacts with positive test results at the start of quarantine, 17.2% had subclinical infection. Having contact with a household member and younger age were the major risk factors for acquiring pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus infection. One person in 6 with confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was asymptomatic.","Pang, Xinghuo; Yang, Peng; Li, Shuang; Zhang, Li; Tian, Lili; Li, Yang; Liu, Bo; Zhang, Yi; Liu, Baiwei; Huang, Ruogang; Li, Xinyu; Wang, Quanyi",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310645/,150
892,Preparation of an antitumor and antivirus agent: chemical modification of α-MMC and MAP30 from Momordica Charantia L. with covalent conjugation of polyethyelene glycol,2012-06-27,"BACKGROUND: Alpha-momorcharin (α-MMC) and momordica anti-HIV protein (MAP30) derived from Momordica charantia L. have been confirmed to possess antitumor and antivirus activities due to their RNA-N-glycosidase activity. However, strong immunogenicity and short plasma half-life limit their clinical application. To solve this problem, the two proteins were modified with (mPEG)(2)-Lys-NHS (20 kDa). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this article, a novel purification strategy for the two main type I ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), α-MMC and MAP30, was successfully developed for laboratory-scale preparation. Using this dramatic method, 200 mg of α-MMC and about 120 mg of MAP30 was obtained in only one purification process from 200 g of Momordica charantia seeds. The homogeneity and some other properties of the two proteins were assessed by gradient SDS-PAGE, electrospray ionization quadruple mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequence analysis as well as Western blot. Two polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated proteins were synthesized and purified. Homogeneous mono-, di-, or tri-PEGylated proteins were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The analysis of antitumor and antivirus activities indicated that the serial PEGylated RIPs preserved moderate activities on JAR choriocarcinoma cells and herpes simplex virus-1. Furthermore, both PEGylated proteins showed about 60%–70% antitumor and antivirus activities, and at the same time decreased 50%–70% immunogenicity when compared with their unmodified counterparts. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: α-MMC and MAP30 obtained from this novel purification strategy can meet the requirement of a large amount of samples for research. Their chemical modification can solve the problem of strong immunogenicity and meanwhile preserve moderate activities. All these findings suggest the potential application of PEGylated α-MMC and PEGylated MAP30 as antitumor and antivirus agents. According to these results, PEGylated RIPs can be constructed with nanomaterials to be a targeting drug that can further decrease immunogenicity and side effects. Through nanotechnology we can make them low-release drugs, which can further prolong their half-life period in the human body.","Meng, Yao; Liu, Shuangfeng; Li, Juan; Meng, Yanfa; Zhao, Xiaojun",Int J Nanomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396394/,150
1053,"Lessons from the History of Quarantine, from Plague to Influenza A",2013-02-11,"In the new millennium, the centuries-old strategy of quarantine is becoming a powerful component of the public health response to emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. During the 2003 pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the use of quarantine, border controls, contact tracing, and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat in just over 3 months. For centuries, these practices have been the cornerstone of organized responses to infectious disease outbreaks. However, the use of quarantine and other measures for controlling epidemic diseases has always been controversial because such strategies raise political, ethical, and socioeconomic issues and require a careful balance between public interest and individual rights. In a globalized world that is becoming ever more vulnerable to communicable diseases, a historical perspective can help clarify the use and implications of a still-valid public health strategy.","Tognotti, Eugenia",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3559034/,150

1326,Massively parallel pathogen identification using high‐density microarrays,2007-11-22,"Identification of microbial pathogens in clinical specimens is still performed by phenotypic methods that are often slow and cumbersome, despite the availability of more comprehensive genotyping technologies. We present an approach based on whole‐genome amplification and resequencing microarrays for unbiased pathogen detection. This 10 h process identifies a broad spectrum of bacterial and viral species and predicts antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity and virulence profiles. We successfully identify a variety of bacteria and viruses, both in isolation and in complex mixtures, and the high specificity of the microarray distinguishes between different pathogens that cause diseases with overlapping symptoms. The resequencing approach also allows identification of organisms whose sequences are not tiled on the array, greatly expanding the repertoire of identifiable organisms and their variants. We identify organisms by hybridization of their DNA in as little as 1–4 h. Using this method, we identified Monkeypox virus and drug‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a skin lesion taken from a child suspected of an orthopoxvirus infection, despite poor transport conditions of the sample, and a vast excess of human DNA. Our results suggest this technology could be applied in a clinical setting to test for numerous pathogens in a rapid, sensitive and unbiased manner.","Berthet, Nicolas; Dickinson, Philip; Filliol, Ingrid; Reinhardt, Anita K.; Batejat, Christophe; Vallaeys, Tatiana; Kong, Katherine A.; Davies, Christopher; Lee, Walter; Zhang, Shenglan; Turpaz, Yaron; Heym, Beate; Coralie, Gilberte; Dacheux, Laurent; Burguière, Ana Maria; Bourhy, Hervé; Old, Iain G.; Manuguerra, Jean‐Claude; Cole, Stewart T.; Kennedy, Giulia C.",Microb Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3864434/,150
1461,Tollip or Not Tollip: What Are the Evolving Questions behind It?,2014-05-14,"Tollip plays an important role in the interleukin-1 receptor IL-1R and Toll pathways. As a modulator of the immune pathway, it indirectly controls the amount of antimicrobial peptides. This could indicate a vital step in maintaining animal immune systems and preventing infection. Evolutionary questions are crucial to understanding the conservation and functioning of the biochemical pathways like the Tollip-mediated one. Through an analysis of 36 sequences of the Tollip protein from different animal taxa, downloaded from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databank, we inferred diverse evolutionary parameters, such as molecular selection and structure conservation, by analyzing residue by residue, beyond the canonical parameters to this type of study, as maximum likelihood trees. We found that Tollip presented different trends in its evolving history. In primates, the protein is becoming more unstable, just the opposite is observed in the arthropod group. The most interesting finding was the concentration of positively selected residues at amino terminal ends. Some observed topological incongruences in maximum likelihood trees of complete and curated Tollip data sets could be explained through horizontal transfers, evidenced by recombination detection. These results suggest that there is more to be researched and understood about this protein.","Luiz, Denis Prudencio; Santos Júnior, Célio Dias; Bonetti, Ana Maria; Brandeburgo, Malcom Antônio Manfredi",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4020778/,150
1686,Unequivocal glycyrrhizin isomer determination and comparative in vitro bioactivities of root extracts in four Glycyrrhiza species,2014-05-14,"Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice, is a popular herbal supplement used for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions and as sweetener in the food industry. This species contains a myriad of phytochemicals including the major saponin glycoside glycyrrhizin (G) of Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) aglycone. In this study, 2D-ROESY NMR technique was successfully applied for distinguishing 18α and 18β glycyrrhetinic acid (GA). ROESY spectra acquired from G. glabra, Glycyrrhiza uralensis and Glycyrrhiza inflata crude extracts revealed the presence of G in its β-form. Anti-inflammatory activity of four Glycyrrhiza species, G, glabra, G. uralensis, G. inflata, and G. echinata roots was assessed against COX-1 inhibition revealing that phenolics rather than glycyrrhizin are biologically active in this assay. G. inflata exhibits a strong cytotoxic effect against PC3 and HT29 cells lines, whereas other species are inactive. This study presents an effective NMR method for G isomer assignment in licorice extracts that does not require any preliminary chromatography or any other purification step.","Farag, Mohamed A.; Porzel, Andrea; Wessjohann, Ludger A.",J Adv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4293670/,150
1866,Pathology in Captive Wild Felids at German Zoological Gardens,2015-06-18,"This retrospective study provides an overview on spontaneous diseases occurring in 38 captive wild felids submitted for necropsy by German zoological gardens between 2004 and 2013. Species included 18 tigers, 8 leopards, 7 lions, 3 cheetahs and 2 cougars with an age ranging from 0.5 to 22 years. Renal lesions, predominantly tubular alterations (intra-tubular concrements, tubular degeneration, necrosis, intra-tubular cellular debris, proteinaceous casts, dilated tubuli) followed by interstitial (lympho-plasmacytic inflammation, fibrosis, metastatic-suppurative inflammation, eosinophilic inflammation) and glomerular lesions (glomerulonephritis, glomerulosclerosis, amyloidosis) were detected in 33 out of 38 animals (87%). Tumors were found in 19 of 38 felids (50%) with 12 animals showing more than one neoplasm. The tumor prevalence increased with age. Neoplasms originated from endocrine (11), genital (8), lympho-hematopoietic (5) and alimentary organs (4) as well as the mesothelium (3). Most common neoplasms comprised uterine/ovarian leiomyomas (5/2), thyroid adenomas/adenocarcinoma (5/1), pleural mesotheliomas (3), hemangiosarcomas (2) and glossal papillomas (2). Inflammatory changes were frequently encountered in the intestine and the lung. Two young animals displayed metastatic mineralization suggestive of a vitamin D- or calcium intoxication. One tiger exhibited degenerative white matter changes consistent with an entity termed large felid leukoencephalomyelopathy. Various hyperplastic, degenerative and inflammatory changes with minor clinical significance were found in several organs. Summarized, renal lesions followed by neoplastic changes as well as inflammatory changes in lung and gastrointestinal tract represent the most frequent findings in captive wild felids living in German zoological gardens.","Junginger, Johannes; Hansmann, Florian; Herder, Vanessa; Lehmbecker, Annika; Peters, Martin; Beyerbach, Martin; Wohlsein, Peter; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4472349/,150
2054,Gene silencing of TACE enhances plaque stability and improves vascular remodeling in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis,2015-12-14,"We aimed to test the hypothesis that gene silencing of tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE) may attenuate lesion inflammation and positive vascular remodeling and enhance plaque stability in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis. Lentivirus-mediated TACE shRNA was injected into the abdominal aortic plaques of rabbits which effectively down-regulated TACE expression and activities from week 8 to week 16. TACE gene silencing reduced remodeling index and plaque burden, and diminished the content of macrophages and lipids while increased that of smooth muscle cells and collagen in the aortic plaques. In addition, TACE gene silencing attenuated the local expression of P65, iNOS, ICAM-1, VEGF and Flt-1 and activities of MMP9 and MMP2 while increased the local expression of TGF-β1 together with reduced number of neovessels in the aorta. TACE shRNA treatment resulted in down-regulated expression of TACE in macrophages and blunted ERK-P38 phosphorylation and tube formation of co-cultured mouse vascular smooth muscle cells or human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In conclusion, gene silencing of TACE enhanced plaque stability and improved vascular positive remodeling. The mechanisms may involve attenuated local inflammation, neovascularization and MMP activation, as well as enhanced collagen production probably via down-regulated ERK-NF-κB and up-regulated TGF-β1 signaling pathways.","Zhao, Xueqiang; Kong, Jing; Zhao, Yuxia; Wang, Xuping; Bu, Peili; Zhang, Cheng; Zhang, Yun",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677302/,150
2348,Linear Quantitative Profiling Method Fast Monitors Alkaloids of Sophora Flavescens That Was Verified by Tri-Marker Analyses,2016-08-16,"The present study demonstrated the use of the Linear Quantitative Profiling Method (LQPM) to evaluate the quality of Alkaloids of Sophora flavescens (ASF) based on chromatographic fingerprints in an accurate, economical and fast way. Both linear qualitative and quantitative similarities were calculated in order to monitor the consistency of the samples. The results indicate that the linear qualitative similarity (LQLS) is not sufficiently discriminating due to the predominant presence of three alkaloid compounds (matrine, sophoridine and oxymatrine) in the test samples; however, the linear quantitative similarity (LQTS) was shown to be able to obviously identify the samples based on the difference in the quantitative content of all the chemical components. In addition, the fingerprint analysis was also supported by the quantitative analysis of three marker compounds. The LQTS was found to be highly correlated to the contents of the marker compounds, indicating that quantitative analysis of the marker compounds may be substituted with the LQPM based on the chromatographic fingerprints for the purpose of quantifying all chemicals of a complex sample system. Furthermore, once reference fingerprint (RFP) developed from a standard preparation in an immediate detection way and the composition similarities calculated out, LQPM could employ the classical mathematical model to effectively quantify the multiple components of ASF samples without any chemical standard.","Hou, Zhifei; Sun, Guoxiang; Guo, Yong",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987015/,150
2350,Targeting by AutophaGy proteins (TAG): Targeting of IFNG-inducible GTPases to membranes by the LC3 conjugation system of autophagy,2016-05-12,"LC3 has been used as a marker to locate autophagosomes. However, it is also well established that LC3 can localize on various membranous structures other than autophagosomes. We recently demonstrated that the LC3 conjugation system (ATG7, ATG3, and ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L1) is required to target LC3 and IFNG (interferon, gamma)-inducible GTPases to the parasitophorus vacuole membrane (PVM) of a protist parasite Toxoplasma gondii and consequently for IFNG to control T. gondii infection. Here we show that not only LC3, but also its homologs (GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2) localize on the PVM of T. gondii in a conjugation-dependent manner. Knockout/knockdown of all LC3 homologs led to a significant reduction in targeting of the IFNG-inducible GTPases to the PVM of T. gondii and the IFNG-mediated control of T. gondii infection. Furthermore, when we relocated the ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L1 complex, which specifies the conjugation site of LC3 homologs, to alternative target membranes, the IFNG-inducible GTPases were targeted to the new target membranes rather than the PVM of T. gondii. These data suggest that the localization of LC3 homologs onto a membrane by the LC3 conjugation system is necessary and sufficient for targeting of the IFNG-inducible GTPases to the membrane, implying Targeting by AutophaGy proteins (TAG). Our data further suggest that the conjugation of ubiquitin-like LC3 homologs to the phospholipids of membranes may change the destiny of the membranes beyond degradation through lysosomal fusion, as the conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins changes the destiny of the proteins beyond proteasomal degradation.","Park, Sungwoo; Choi, Jayoung; Biering, Scott B.; Dominici, Erin; Williams, Lelia E.; Hwang, Seungmin",Autophagy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4990996/,150
2590,Diversity of Cryptosporidium species occurring in sheep and goat breeds reared in Poland,2017-01-05,"The aim of this study was molecular identification of Cryptosporidium species and assessment of their prevalence in different breeds of sheep and goat reared in Poland. In addition, the relationship between animal age, breed type, and the frequency of Cryptosporidium infections was determined. Fecal samples from 234 lambs and 105 goat kids aged up to 9 weeks, representing 24 breeds and their cross-breeds were collected from 71 small ruminant farms across Poland. The identification of Cryptosporidium species was performed at the 18 SSU ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and COWP loci followed by subtyping of C. parvum and C. hominis strains at GP60 gene locus. The presence of Cryptosporidium DNA at the 18 SSU rRNA locus was detected in 45/234 (19.2%) lamb feces samples and in 39/105 (37.1%) taken from goats. The following Cryptosporidium species: C. xiaoi, C. bovis, C. ubiquitum, C. parvum, and C. hominis were detected in small ruminants. Infections caused by C. xiaoi were predominant without favoring any tested animal species. Subsequent GP60 subtyping revealed the presence of C. parvum IIaA17G1R1 subtype in sheep and IIdA23G1 subtype in goats. IIdA23G1 subtype was detected in a goat host for the first time. There were no significant differences found in frequency of infections between the age groups (<3 and 3–9 weeks) of lambs (P = 0.14, α > 0.05) or goat kids (P = 0.06, α > 0.05). In addition, there was no correlation observed between the frequency in occurrence of particular parasite species and breed type in relation to native sheep breeds (F = 0.11; P = 0.990 > 0.05). In the case of goats, more breed-related differences in parasite occurrence were found. The results of this study improve our knowledge on the breed-related occurrence of Cryptosporidium infections in the population of small ruminants reared in Poland.","Kaupke, Agnieszka; Michalski, Mirosław M.; Rzeżutka, Artur",Parasitol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5313596/,150
2638,Antibody Engineering for Pursuing a Healthier Future,2017-03-28,"Since the development of antibody-production techniques, a number of immunoglobulins have been developed on a large scale using conventional methods. Hybridoma technology opened a new horizon in the production of antibodies against target antigens of infectious pathogens, malignant diseases including autoimmune disorders, and numerous potent toxins. However, these clinical humanized or chimeric murine antibodies have several limitations and complexities. Therefore, to overcome these difficulties, recent advances in genetic engineering techniques and phage display technique have allowed the production of highly specific recombinant antibodies. These engineered antibodies have been constructed in the hunt for novel therapeutic drugs equipped with enhanced immunoprotective abilities, such as engaging immune effector functions, effective development of fusion proteins, efficient tumor and tissue penetration, and high-affinity antibodies directed against conserved targets. Advanced antibody engineering techniques have extensive applications in the fields of immunology, biotechnology, diagnostics, and therapeutic medicines. However, there is limited knowledge regarding dynamic antibody development approaches. Therefore, this review extends beyond our understanding of conventional polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, recent advances in antibody engineering techniques together with antibody fragments, display technologies, immunomodulation, and broad applications of antibodies are discussed to enhance innovative antibody production in pursuit of a healthier future for humans.","Saeed, Abdullah F.

3031,A Low-Cost Palmtop High-Speed Capillary Electrophoresis Bioanalyzer with Laser Induced Fluorescence Detection,2018-01-29,"In this work, we developed a miniaturized palmtop high-speed capillary electrophoresis (CE) system integrating whole modules, including picoliter-scale sample injection, short capillary-based fast CE, high-voltage power supply, orthogonal laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detection, battery, system control, on-line data acquisition, processing, storage, and display modules. A strategy of minimalist miniaturization combining minimal system design and low-cost system construction was adopted to achieve the instrument miniaturization with extremely low cost, which is differing from the current microfabrication strategy used in most reported miniaturized CE systems. With such a strategy, the total size of the bioanalyzer was minimized to 90 × 75 × 77 mm (length × width × height) and the instrument cost was reduced to ca. $500, which demonstrated the smallest and lowest-cost CE instrument with LIF detection in so far reported systems. The present bioanalyzer also exhibited comparable analytical performances to previously-reported high-speed CE systems. A limit of detection of 1.02 nM sodium fluorescein was obtained. Fast separations were achieved for multiple types of samples as amino acids, amino acid enantiomers, DNA fragments, and proteins with high efficiency.

3181,Towards the Application of Human Defensins as Antivirals,2018-01-09,"Defensins are antimicrobial peptides that participate in the innate immunity of hosts. Humans constitutively and/or inducibly express α- and β-defensins, which are known for their antiviral and antibacterial activities. This review describes the application of human defensins. We discuss the extant experimental results, limited though they are, to consider the potential applicability of human defensins as antiviral agents. Given their antiviral effects, we propose that basic research be conducted on human defensins that focuses on RNA viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and dengue virus (DENV), which are considered serious human pathogens but have posed huge challenges for vaccine development for different reasons. Concerning the prophylactic and therapeutic applications of defensins, we then discuss the applicability of human defensins as antivirals that has been demonstrated in reports using animal models. Finally, we discuss the potential adjuvant-like activity of human defensins and propose an exploration of the ‘defensin vaccine’ concept to prime the body with a controlled supply of human defensins. In sum, we suggest a conceptual framework to achieve the practical application of human defensins to combat viral infections.","Park, Mee Sook; Kim, Jin Il; Lee, Ilseob; Park, Sehee; Bae, Joon-Yong; Park, Man-Seong",Biomol Ther (Seoul),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5933891/,150
3216,Changing Priorities in Vaccinology: Antibiotic Resistance Moving to the Top,2018-05-30,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is currently the most alarming issue for human health. AMR already causes 700,000 deaths/year. It is estimated that 10 million deaths due to AMR will occur every year after 2050. This equals the number of people dying of cancer every year in present times. International institutions such as G20, World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO), UN General Assembly, European Union, and the UK and USA governments are calling for new antibiotics. To underline this emergency, a list of antibiotic-resistant “priority pathogens” has been published by WHO. It contains 12 families of bacteria that represent the greatest danger for human health. Resistance to multiple antibiotics is particularly relevant for the Gram-negative bacteria present in the list. The ability of these bacteria to develop mechanisms to resist treatment could be transmitted with genetic material, allowing other bacteria to become drug resistant. Although the search for new antimicrobial drugs remains a top priority, the pipeline for new antibiotics is not promising, and alternative solutions are needed. A possible answer to AMR is vaccination. In fact, while antibiotic resistance emerges rapidly, vaccines can lead to a much longer lasting control of infections. New technologies, such as the high-throughput cloning of human B cells from convalescent or vaccinated people, allow for finding new protective antigens (Ags) that could not be identified with conventional technologies. Antibodies produced by convalescent B cell clones can be screened for their ability to bind, block, and kill bacteria, using novel high-throughput microscopy platforms that rapidly capture digital images, or by conventional technologies such as bactericidal, opsono-phagocytosis and FACS assays. Selected antibodies expressed by recombinant DNA techniques can be used for passive immunization in animal models and tested for protection. Antibodies providing the best protection can be employed to identify new Ags and then used for generating highly specific recombinant Fab fragments. Co-crystallization of Ags bound to Fab fragments will allow us to determine the structure and characteristics of new Ags. This structure-based Ag design will bring to a new generation of vaccines able to target previously elusive infections, thereby offering an effective solution to the problem of AMR.","Tagliabue, Aldo; Rappuoli, Rino",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5992407/,150
3302,Oral edible plant vaccine containing hypoallergen of American cockroach major allergen Per a 2 prevents roach-allergic asthma in a murine model,2018-07-30,"BACKGROUND: American cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) are an important indoor allergen source and a major risk factor for exacerbations and poor control of asthma. We previously reported that allergen components from American cockroaches exhibit varying levels of pathogenicity. Sensitization to major American cockroach allergen, Per a 2, correlated with more severe clinical phenotypes among patients with allergic airway diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we examined whether oral plant vaccine-encoding full-length Per a 2 clone-996 or its hypoallergenic clone-372 could exert a prophylactic role in Per a 2-sensitized mice. The cDNAs coding Per a 2–996 and Per a 2–372 were inserted into TuMV vector and expressed in Chinese cabbage. Adult female BALB/c mice were fed with the cabbage extracts for 21 days and subsequently underwent two-step sensitization with recombinant Per a 2. RESULTS: Per a 2-specific IgE measured by in-house ELISA in the sera of Per a 2-372-treated groups were significantly lower than in the control groups after allergen challenge but not the Per a 2-996-treated group. Moreover, Per a 2–372 vaccine markedly decreased airway hyper-responsiveness and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lungs, as well as reduced mRNA expression of IL-4 and IL-13 in comparison with the control mice. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that oral administration of edible plant vaccine encoding Per a 2 hypo-allergen may be used as a prophylactic strategy against the development of cockroach allergy.","Lee, Mey-Fann; Chiang, Chu-Hui; Li, Ying-Lan; Wang, Nancy M.; Song, Pei-Pong; Lin, Shyh-Jye; Chen, Yi-Hsing",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6066233/,150
3431,Spatial infectious disease epidemiology: on the cusp,2018-10-18,"Infectious diseases continue to pose a significant public health burden despite the great progress achieved in their prevention and control over the last few decades. Our ability to disentangle the factors and mechanisms driving their propagation in space and time has dramatically advanced in recent years. The current era is rich in mathematical and computational tools and detailed geospatial information, including sociodemographic, geographic, and environmental data, which are essential to elucidate key drivers of infectious disease transmission from epidemiological and genetic data. Indeed, this paradigm shift was driven by dramatic advances in complex systems approaches along with substantial improvements in data availability and computational power. The burgeoning output of infectious disease spatial modeling suggests that we are close to a fully integrated approach for early epidemic detection and intervention. This special collection in BMC Medicine aims to bring together a broad range of quantitative investigations that improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal transmission dynamics of infectious diseases in order to mitigate their impact on the human population.","Chowell, G; Rothenberg, R",BMC Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6193292/,150
3493,Gene Knockdowns in Adult Animals: PPMOs and Vivo-Morpholinos,2009-03-25,"Antisense molecules do not readily cross cell membranes. This has limited the use of antisense to systems where techniques have been worked out to introduce the molecules into cells, such as embryos and cell cultures. Uncharged antisense bearing a group of guanidinium moieties on either a linear peptide or dendrimer scaffold can enter cells by endocytosis and subsequently escape from endosomes into the cytosol/nuclear compartment of cells. These technologies allow systemic administration of antisense, making gene knockdowns and splice modification feasible in adult animals; this review presents examples of such animal studies. Techniques developed with PPMOs, which are an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide linked to a Morpholino oligo, can also be performed using commercially available Vivo-Morpholinos, which are eight guanidinium groups on a dendrimeric scaffold linked to a Morpholino oligo. Antisense-based techniques such as blocking translation, modifying pre-mRNA splicing, inhibiting miRNA maturation and inhibiting viral replication can be conveniently applied in adult animals by injecting PPMOs or Vivo-Morpholinos.","Moulton, Jon D.; Jiang, Shan",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6253989/,150
3648,Using noninvasive metagenomics to characterize viral communities from wildlife,2018-10-19,"Microbial communities play an important role in organismal and ecosystem health. While high‐throughput metabarcoding has revolutionized the study of bacterial communities, generating comparable viral communities has proven elusive, particularly in wildlife samples where the diversity of viruses and limited quantities of viral nucleic acid present distinctive challenges. Metagenomic sequencing is a promising solution for studying viral communities, but the lack of standardized methods currently precludes comparisons across host taxa or localities. Here, we developed an untargeted shotgun metagenomic sequencing protocol to generate comparable viral communities from noninvasively collected faecal and oropharyngeal swabs. Using samples from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus), a key species for virus transmission to humans and domestic animals, we tested how different storage media, nucleic acid extraction procedures and enrichment steps affect viral community detection. Based on finding viral contamination in foetal bovine serum, we recommend storing swabs in RNAlater or another nonbiological medium. We recommend extracting nucleic acid directly from swabs rather than from supernatant or pelleted material, which had undetectable levels of viral RNA. Results from a low‐input RNA library preparation protocol suggest that ribosomal RNA depletion and light DNase treatment reduce host and bacterial nucleic acid, and improve virus detection. Finally, applying our approach to twelve pooled samples from seven localities in Peru, we showed that detected viral communities saturated at the attained sequencing depth, allowing unbiased comparisons of viral community composition. Future studies using the methods outlined here will elucidate the determinants of viral communities across host species, environments and time.","Bergner, Laura M.; Orton, Richard J.; da Silva Filipe, Ana; Shaw, Andrew E.; Becker, Daniel J.; Tello, Carlos; Biek, Roman; Streicker, Daniel G.",Mol Ecol Resour,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6378809/,150
4080,Digitizable therapeutics for decentralized mitigation of global pandemics,2019-10-04,"When confronted with a globally spreading epidemic, we seek efficient strategies for drug dissemination, creating a competition between supply and demand at a global scale. Propagating along similar networks, e.g., air-transportation, the spreading dynamics of the supply vs. the demand are, however, fundamentally different, with the pathogens driven by contagion dynamics, and the drugs by commodity flow. We show that these different dynamics lead to intrinsically distinct spreading patterns: while viruses spread homogeneously across all destinations, creating a concurrent global demand, commodity flow unavoidably leads to a highly uneven spread, in which selected nodes are rapidly supplied, while the majority remains deprived. Consequently, even under ideal conditions of extreme production and shipping capacities, due to the inherent heterogeneity of network-based commodity flow, efficient mitigation becomes practically unattainable, as homogeneous demand is met by highly heterogeneous supply. Therefore, we propose here a decentralized mitigation strategy, based on local production and dissemination of therapeutics, that, in effect, bypasses the existing distribution networks. Such decentralization is enabled thanks to the recent development of digitizable therapeutics, based on, e.g., short DNA sequences or printable chemical compounds, that can be distributed as digital sequence files and synthesized on location via DNA/3D printing technology. We test our decentralized mitigation under extremely challenging conditions, such as suppressed local production rates or low therapeutic efficacy, and find that thanks to its homogeneous nature, it consistently outperforms the centralized alternative, saving many more lives with significantly less resources.","Hacohen, Adar; Cohen, Reuven; Efroni, Sol; Barzel, Baruch; Bachelet, Ido",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6778202/,150

We investigated factors structuring the helminth and protozoan infections of wolves (Canis lupus) by using coprological analyses. Faecal samples (n = 342) were analysed from 11 wolf packs belonging to three different geographical and ecological settings in Italy (Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise National Park, PNALM: 4 packs, 88 samples), in France (Mercantour National Park, PNM: 4 packs, 68 samples) and in the U.S.A. (Yellowstone National Park, YNP: 3 packs, 186 samples). Parasites were found in 29.4%–88.6% of the samples and parasite taxa ranged from four to ten in each study area. Taeniidae (Taenia/Echinococcus), Sarcocystis spp. and Toxascaris leonina were most common in faecal samples from YNP, whereas Capillaria spp., Taeniidae and Uncinaria stenocephala were predominant in PNALM. We used generalised linear mixed models to assess the relationship between parasite infection or the number of parasite taxa and selected ecological drivers across study areas. Significant effects illustrated the importance of the ecological factors such as occurrence of free-ranging dogs, diet composition and wolf density, as well as the ancestry of the wolf populations, in shaping parasite-wolf communities. Additional investigations are needed to elucidate the impact of parasitic infections on wolf populations, as well as the role of anthropogenic factors in facilitating parasitic diffusion to apex predators.","Molnar, Barbara; Ciucci, Paolo; Mastrantonio, Gianluca; Betschart, Bruno",Int J Parasitol Parasites Wildl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6812024/,150

The B. aryabhattai strain produced 2.8 g/L PHBV, equivalent to 71.15% of cell dry mass in a medium supplemented with propionic acid, after 48 h incubation. The optimum temperature and pH for the copolymer accumulation was 31 °C and 7, respectively. The gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses confirmed the polymer obtained as PHBV. The differential scanning calorimetry analysis revealed that the melting point of the material as 90 °C and its thermal stability up to 220 °C. The average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index of the sample was estimated by gel permeation chromatography analysis and observed as 128.508 kDa and 2.82, respectively. The PHBV showed tensile strength of 10.3 MPa and elongation at break of 13.3%. The PHBV and their blends with PEG were tested for cytotoxicity on human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and the cells incubated with PHBV/PEG2kDa blends were 99% viable, whereas with the PHBV alone showed comparatively higher cytotoxicity.

It is unknown from which anatomical site of the respiratory tract influenza A virus transmission occurs. Here, pairs of genetically tagged and untagged influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and A/H5N1 viruses that are transmissible via the air are used to co-infect donor ferrets via the intranasal and intratracheal routes to cause an upper and lower respiratory tract infection, respectively. In all transmission cases, we observe that the viruses in the recipient ferrets are of the same genotype as the viruses inoculated intranasally, demonstrating that they are expelled from the upper respiratory tract of ferrets rather than from trachea or the lower airways. Moreover, influenza A viruses that are transmissible via the air preferentially infect ferret and human nasal respiratory epithelium. These results indicate that virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, the nasal respiratory epithelium in particular, of donors is a driver for transmission of influenza A viruses via the air.","Richard, Mathilde; van den Brand, Judith M.

4540,Host–microbiome coevolution can promote cooperation in a rock–paper–scissors dynamics,2020-02-12,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms and pathways to impacts from public health research in the UK have not been widely studied. Through the lens of one funder (NIHR), our aims are to map the diversity of public health research, in terms of funding mechanisms, disciplinary contributions, and public health impacts, identify examples of impacts, and pathways to impact that existing reporting mechanisms may not otherwise have captured, and provide illustrations of how public health researchers perceive the generation of non-academic impact from their work. METHODS: A total of 1386 projects were identified as ‘public health research’ by the NIHR and listed in the NIHR Public Health Overview database (2000–2016). From these, a subset of 857 projects were matched as potentially having begun reporting impacts via an external data-gathering platform (Researchfish). Data on the 857 projects were analyzed quantitatively, and nine projects were selected to investigate further through semi-structured interviews with principal investigators. Two workshops took place to validate emerging and final findings and facilitate analysis. RESULTS: In addition to the NIHR School for Public Health Research and the NIHR Public Health Research Programme, 89% of projects contained in the NIHR Public Health Overview portfolio as ‘public health research’ are funded via other NIHR research programmes, suggesting significant diversity in disciplines contributing to public health research and outcomes. The pathways to impact observed in our in-depth case studies include contributing to debates on what constitutes appropriate evidence for national policy change, acknowledging local ‘unintended’ impacts, building trusted relationships with stakeholders across health and non-health sectors and actors, collaborating with local authorities, and using non-academic dissemination channels. CONCLUSIONS: Public health as a discipline contributes substantially to impact beyond academia. To support the diversity of these impacts, we need to recognise localized smaller-scale impacts, and the difference in types of evidence required for community and local authority-based impacts. This will also require building capacity and resources to enable impact to take place from public health research. Finally, support is required for engagement with local authorities and working with non-health sectors that contribute to health outcomes.","Boulding, Harriet; Kamenetzky, Adam; Ghiga, Ioana; Ioppolo, Becky; Herrera, Facundo; Parks, Sarah; Manville, Catriona; Guthrie, Susan; Hinrichs-Krapels, Saba",BMC Med Res Methodol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7031933/,150
4589,Mosquito-borne viral diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: a review,2020-02-27,"BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid treatment has been widely used in the treatment of septic shock, influenza, and ARDS, although some previous studies discourage its use in severe influenza patients. This multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted in the intensive care units (ICUs) of eight medical centers across Taiwan aims to determine the real-world status of corticosteroid treatment in patients with influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and its impact on clinical outcomes. Between October 2015 and March 2016, consecutive ICU patients with virology-proven influenza infections who fulfilled ARDS and received invasive mechanical ventilation were enrolled. The impact of early corticosteroid treatment (≥ 200 mg hydrocortisone equivalent dose within 3 days after ICU admission, determined by a sensitivity analysis) on hospital mortality (the primary outcome) was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis, and further confirmed in a propensity score-matched cohort. RESULTS: Among the 241 patients with influenza-associated ARDS, 85 (35.3%) patients receiving early corticosteroid treatment had similar baseline characteristics, but a significantly higher hospital mortality rate than those without early corticosteroid treatment [43.5% (37/85) vs. 19.2% (30/156), p < 0.001]. Early corticosteroid treatment was independently associated with increased hospital mortality in overall patients [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) = 5.02 (2.39–10.54), p < 0.001] and in all subgroups. Earlier treatment and higher dosing were associated with higher hospital mortality. Early corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significantly increased odds of subsequent bacteremia [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) = 2.37 (1.01–5.56)]. The analyses using a propensity score-matched cohort showed consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: Early corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significantly increased hospital mortality in adult patients with influenza-associated ARDS. Earlier treatment and higher dosing were associated with higher hospital mortality. Clinicians should be cautious while using corticosteroid treatment in this patient group.","Tsai, Ming-Ju; Yang, Kuang-Yao; Chan, Ming-Cheng; Kao, Kuo-Chin; Wang, Hao-Chien; Perng, Wann-Cherng; Wu, Chieh-Liang; Liang, Shinn-Jye; Fang, Wen-Feng; Tsai, Jong-Rung; Chang, Wei-An; Chien, Ying-Chun; Chen, Wei-Chih; Hu, Han-Chung; Lin, Chiung-Yu; Chao, Wen-Cheng; Sheu, Chau-Chyun",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7046839/,150

5055,Effects of T-2 mycotoxin on gastrointestinal tissues: A Review ofin vivo andin vitro models,1989,"Segmental genomes (i.e., genomes in which the genetic information is dispersed between two or more discrete molecules) are abundant in RNA viruses, but virtually absent in DNA viruses. It has been suggested that the division of information in RNA viruses expands the pool of variation available to natural selection by providing for the reassortment of modular RNAs from different genetic sources. This explanation is based on the apparent inability of related RNA molecules to undergo the kinds of physical recombination that generate variation among related DNA molecules. In this paper we propose a radically different hypothesis. Self-replicating RNA genomes have an error rate of about 10(−3)–10(−4) substitutions per base per generation, whereas for DNA genomes the corresponding figure is 10(−9)–10(−11). Thus the level of noise in the RNA copier process is five to eight orders of magnitude higher than that in the DNA process. Since a small module of information has a higher chance of passing undamaged through a noisy channel than does a large one, the division of RNA viral information among separate small units increases its overall chances of survival. The selective advantage of genome segmentation is most easily modelled for modular RNAs wrapped up in separate viral coats. If modular RNAs are brought together in a common viral coat, segmentation is advantageous only when interactions among the modular RNAs are selective enought to provide some degree of discrimination against miscopied sequences. This requirement is most clearly met by the reoviruses.","Pressing, J.; Reanney, D. C.",J Mol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087551/,150

To this end, we propose a simple model of infection that enables to study the coincidence time of two random walkers on an arbitrary graph. By studying the coincidence time of a susceptible and an infected individual both moving in the graph we obtain estimates of the infection probability. The main result of this paper is to pinpoint the impact of the network topology on the infection probability. More precisely, we prove that for homogeneous graphs including regular graphs and the classical Erdős–Rényi model, the coincidence time is inversely proportional to the number of nodes in the graph. We then study the model on power-law graphs, that exhibit heterogeneous connectivity patterns, and show the existence of a phase transition for the coincidence time depending on the parameter of the power-law of the degree distribution. We finally undertake a preliminary analysis for the case with k random walkers and provide upper bounds on the convergence time for both the complete graph and regular graphs.","Draief, Moez; Ganesh, Ayalvadi",Discret Event Dyn Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088300/,150

Adenoviral (Ad) vectors, although highly efficient in liver gene transfer, have proven to be limited for pulmonary gene transfer with respect to efficiency, in part because of difficulty in assuring significant residence time in the lung and/or paucity of receptors for adenovirus on the endothelium. A recent study has shown that the use of a bispecific antibody to endothelial cells and Ad vectors efficiently redirects Ad vectors to pulmonary endothelium and improves gene expression in the lung. In this study, we report that pulmonary gene transfer by Ad vectors can also be improved significantly via the use of cationic liposomes. Preinjection of cationic liposomes followed by adenovirus led to a significant increase in the level of gene expression in the lung. The improvement in pulmonary gene transfer was associated with a decrease in the level of gene expression in the liver. Gene expression in the lung lasted for up to 2 weeks. This protocol, together with genetic modification of adenovirus, may prove to be useful for pulmonary gene transfer for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. This method may also be extended to pulmonary gene transfer using other types of viral vectors via vascular route.","Ma, Z; Mi, Z; Wilson, A; Alber, S; Robbins, PD; Watkins, S; Pitt, B; Li, S",Gene Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091708/,150

METHODS: Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups, including normal control, model, dexamethasone (DEX, 5 mg/kg), RDN-H (720 mg/kg), RDN-M (360 mg/kg) and RDN-L (180 mg/kg) groups, with 10 rats in each group. Rats were challenged with intravenous injection of LPS 1 h after intraperitoneal treatment with RDN or DEX. At 6 h after LPS challenge, lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected, and the number of inflammatory cells was determined. The right lungs were collected for histopathologic examination, measurement of gene and protein expressions, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities. RESULTS: In vivo pretreatment of RDN (360, 720 mg/kg) significantly reduced the weight of wet to dry (W/D) ratio of lung, protein content in BALF, and led to remarkable attenuation of LPS-induced histopathological changes in the lungs. Meanwhile, RDN enormously decreased BALF total inflammatory cells, especially neutrophil and macrophage cell numbers. Moreover, RDN increased SOD activity, inhibited MPO activity, alleviated LPS-induced tumor neurosis factor-α (TNF-α) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in lung tissues. Furthermore, RDN (720 mg/kg) efficiently weakened nuclear factorkappa B (NF-κB) gene and protein expression. CONCLUSION: Anti-inflammatory effects of RDN was demonstrated to be preventing pulmonary neutrophil infiltration, lowering MPO activity, TNF-α and iNOS gene expression by inhibiting NF-κB activity in LPS-induced ALI.","Tang, Lu-ping; Xiao, Wei; Li, Yi-fang; Li, Hai-bo; Wang, Zhen-zhong; Yao, Xin-sheng; Kurihara, Hiroshi; He, Rong-rong",Chin J Integr Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101712/,150

Patients who received aminoglycosides had longer time alive away from the ICU (11.3 ± 8.9 (10 [0–20]) vs. 3.2 ± 6.6 (0 [0–2] days; p = 0.002) and free from mechanical ventilation (12.5 ± 9.3 (14 [0–21] vs. 5.5 ± 9.2 (0 [0–10] days; p = 0.02) on day 28. The ICU mortality was 16% in the aminoglycoside group versus 46% (p = 0.03). In the multivariate analysis, patients treated with aminoglycosides were 6 times less likely to die than those treated without aminoglycosides (confidence interval [CI] = [1.3–28.9]; p = 0.02). Our study supports the hypothesis that combination short-term antibiotherapy with an aminoglycoside for ICU-acquired bacteraemias could increase survival.","Delannoy, P.-Y.; Boussekey, N.; Devos, P.; Alfandari, S.; Turbelin, C.; Chiche, A.; Meybeck, A.; Georges, H.; Leroy, O.",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102278/,150

Twelve-month-old rats were trained to run 1½ miles/day in motorized exercise wheel cages, and the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake in these rats was compared with values observed in two groups of similar aged sedentary rats — one fed rat chow ad libitum and the other a calorie-restricted diet for 4 months. Body weight increased and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake decreased as rats fed chow ad libitum grew from 12 to 16 months of age. In contrast, 4 months of either exercise training or calorie restriction prevented weight gain and loss of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Thus, the intensity of exercise training attained in this study did not result in an improvement in insulin action in older rats above and beyond that related to the reduction in rate of body weight gain","Mondon, Carl E.; Sims, Charles; Dolkas, Constantine B.; Reaven, Eve P.; Reaven, Gerald M.",J Gerontol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108518/,150

Viruses could be detected in 522 (37 per cent) cases with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) the most commonly detected (79 per cent) followed by parainfluenza type 3 (8 per cent). Detection of influenza A, B and adenoviruses accounted for 6 per cent, 3 per cent and 2 per cent respectively. Except for parainfluenza virus type 3 the peak of activity of the respiratory viruses was during the winter months (October–February). Parainfluenza virus type 3 could be detected all year round but epidemics can occur in the hottest months of the year (June–August) when the temperature can exceed 40°C. Association between clinical manifestation, type of causative agent, and age was evaluated in 137 infected Saudi children in the first year of the study (April 1993–March 1994). The majority of our cases presented with bronchiolltis (58 per cent) while only 26 per cent had bronchopneumonla. There was a significant association between bronchiolitis and lower age groups (0–6 months), with RSV as the major causative agent of bronchiolitis cases (88 per cent).","Bakir, T. M.

7854,Advances in Vaccines,2019-08-25,"A large problem of histamine receptor research is data heterogeneity. Various experimental approaches, the complex signaling pathways of mammalian cells, and the use of different species orthologues render it difficult to compare and interpret the published results. Thus, the four human histamine receptor subtypes were analyzed side-by-side in the Sf9 insect cell expression system, using radioligand binding assays as well as functional readouts proximal to the receptor activation event (steady-state GTPase assays and [(35)S]GTPγS assays). The human H(1)R was co-expressed with the regulators of G protein signaling RGS4 or GAIP, which unmasked a productive interaction between hH(1)R and insect cell Gα(q). By contrast, functional expression of the hH(2)R required the generation of an hH(2)R-Gsα fusion protein to ensure close proximity of G protein and receptor. Fusion of hH(2)R to the long (Gsα(L)) or short (Gsα(S)) splice variant of Gα(s) resulted in comparable constitutive hH(2)R activity, although both G protein variants show different GDP affinities. Medicinal chemistry studies revealed profound species differences between hH(1)R/hH(2)R and their guinea pig orthologues gpH(1)R/gpH(2)R. The causes for these differences were analyzed by molecular modeling in combination with mutational studies. Co-expression of the hH(3)R with Gα(i1), Gα(i2), Gα(i3), and Gα(i/o) in Sf9 cells revealed high constitutive activity and comparable interaction efficiency with all G protein isoforms. A comparison of various cations (Li(+), Na(+), K(+)) and anions (Cl(−), Br(−), I(−)) revealed that anions with large radii most efficiently stabilize the inactive hH(3)R state. Potential sodium binding sites in the hH(3)R protein were analyzed by expressing specific hH(3)R mutants in Sf9 cells. In contrast to the hH(3)R, the hH(4)R preferentially couples to co-expressed Gα(i2) in Sf9 cells. Its high constitutive activity is resistant to NaCl or GTPγS. The hH(4)R shows structural instability and adopts a G protein-independent high-affinity state. A detailed characterization of affinity and activity of a series of hH(4)R antagonists/inverse agonists allowed first conclusions about structure/activity relationships for inverse agonists at hH(4)R. In summary, the Sf9 cell system permitted a successful side-by-side comparison of all four human histamine receptor subtypes. This chapter summarizes the results of pharmacological as well as medicinal chemistry/molecular modeling approaches and demonstrates that these data are not only important for a deeper understanding of H(x)R pharmacology, but also have significant implications for the molecular pharmacology of GPCRs in general.","Schneider, Erich H.; Seifert, Roland",Histamine and Histamine Receptors in Health and Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120522/,150
7881,The Role of the Plant Nucleolus in Pre-mRNA Processing,2008,"The ability of an influenza virus to transmit efficiently from human-to-human is a major factor in determining the epidemiological impact of that strain. The use of a relevant animal model to identify viral determinants of transmission, as well as host and environmental factors affecting transmission efficiency, is therefore critical for public health. The characterization of newly emerging influenza viruses in terms of their potential to transmit in a mammalian host is furthermore an important part of pandemic risk assessment. For these reasons, a guinea pig model of influenza virus transmission was developed in 2006. The guinea pig provides an important alternative to preexisting models for influenza. Most influenza viruses do not readily transmit among mice. Ferrets, while highly relevant, are expensive and can be difficult to obtain in high numbers. Moreover, it is generally accepted that efforts to accurately model human disease are strengthened by the use of multiple animal species. Herein, we provide an overview of influenza virus infectivity, growth, and transmission in the guinea pig and highlight knowledge gained on the topic of influenza virus transmission using the guinea pig model.","Lowen, Anice C.; Bouvier, Nicole M.; Steel, John",Influenza Pathogenesis and Control - Volume I,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121145/,150

Despite their predictive ability, current algorithmic approaches and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-peptidomic analysis allow limited selectivity. Here, we optimized a method to rapidly screen and identify highly immunogenic epitopes that trigger CTL responses. We used a combined application of this method involving immune-specific signature analysis and HLA-associated peptidomics using samples from six patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in order to select immunogenic HLA epitopes for in vitro testing. Additionally, we applied high-throughput imaging at the single-cell level in order to confirm the immunoreactivity of the selected peptides. The results indicated that this method enabled identification of promising CTL peptides capable of inducing antitumor immunity. This platform combining high-resolution computational analysis, HLA-peptidomics, and high-throughput immunogenicity testing allowed rapid and robust identification of highly immunogenic epitopes and represents a powerful technique for cancer-vaccine development.","Han, Ki-Cheol; Park, Daechan; Ju, Shinyeong; Lee, Young Eun; Heo, Sun-Hee; Kim, Young-Ae; Lee, Ji Eun; Lee, Yuna; Park, Kyong Hwa; Park, Se-Ho; Lee, Hee Jin; Lee, Cheolju; Jang, Mihue",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125174/,150

The molecular mechanisms underlying both events are clearly different; early membrane permeability is induced by isolated virus particles, whereas late membrane leakiness is produced by newly synthesized virus protein(s) that possess activities resembling ionophores or membrane-active toxins. Detailed knowledge of the mechanisms, by which animal viruses permeabilize cells, adds to our understanding of the steps involved in virus replication. Studies on early membrane permeabilization give clues about the processes underlying entry of animal viruses into cells; understanding gained on the modification by viral proteins of membrane permeability during virus replication indicates that membrane leakiness is required for efficient virus release from infected cells or virus budding, in the case of enveloped viruses. In addition, the activity of these membrane-active virus proteins may be related to virus interference with host cell metabolism and with the cytopathic effect that develops after virus infection.","Carrasco, Luis",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131156/,150
8770,In vivo voltammetric studies on release mechanisms for cocaine with γ-butyrolactone,2003-01-22,"This chapter describes the RNA structural characteristics that have emerged so far. Folded RNA molecules are stabilized by a variety of interactions, the most prevalent of which are stacking and hydrogen bonding between bases. Many interactions among backbone atoms also occur in the structure of tRNA, although they are often ignored when considering RNA structure because they are not as well-characterized as interactions among bases. Backbone interactions include hydrogen bonding and the stacking of sugar or phosphate groups with bases or with other sugar and phosphate groups. The interactions found in a three-dimensional RNA structure can be divided into two categories: secondary interactions and tertiary interactions. This division is useful for several reasons. Secondary structures are routinely determined by a combination of techniques discussed in chapter, whereas tertiary interactions are more difficult to determine. Computer algorithms that generate RNA structures can search completely through possible secondary structures, but the inclusion of tertiary interactions makes a complete search of possible structures impractical for RNA molecules even as small as tRNA. The division of RNA structure into building blocks consisting of secondary or tertiary interactions makes it easier to describe RNA structures. In those cases in which RNA studies are incomplete, the studies of DNA are described with the rationalization that RNA structures may be analogous to DNA structures, or that the techniques used to study DNA could be applied to the analogous RNA structures. The chapter focuses on the aspects of RNA structure that affect the three-dimensional shape of RNA and that affect its ability to interact with other molecules.","Chastain, Michael; Tinoco, Ignacio",Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133162/,150

We have studied the pattern of lymphocyte recruitment following partial transection of the mouse spinal cord. Using immunohistochemical techniques, all three types of lymphocytes (CD4‐positive T‐cells, CD8‐ positive T‐cells and B‐cells) were found in the vicinity of the lesion site within hours and persisted for up to 7 days. There was a predominance of B‐lymphocytes during the first 3 days. A second, late phase of cell infiltration, dominated by CD8‐positive T‐lymphocytes, occurred in mice that had been raised in a conventional breeding unit and had acquired antibody titres to a common murine virus (mouse hepatitis virus). In contrast, mice kept in specific pathogen‐free facilities did not show this late‐phase response. These findings suggest a possible role for lymphocytes in secondary tissue loss, local demyelination, scar formation, cytokine‐mediated inflammatory responses or trophic processes. They also provide evidence that a virus infection can significantly enhance the reaction of T‐cells to a spinal cord lesion.","Schnell, Lisa; Schneider, Regula; Berman, Monique A.; Perry, V.

9957,Structured Tree Impedance Outflow Boundary Conditions for 3D Lung Simulations,2010-08-01,"The human lung comprises about 300 million alveoli which are located on bronchioles between the 17th to 24th generations of the acinar tree, with a progressively higher population density in the deeper branches (lower acini). The alveolar size and aspect ratio change with generation number. Due to successive bifurcation, the flow velocity magnitude also decreases as the bronchiole diameter decreases from the upper to lower acini. As a result, fluid dynamic parameters such as Reynolds (Re) and Womersley (α) numbers progressively decrease with increasing generation number. In order to characterize alveolar flow patterns and inhaled particle transport during synchronous ventilation, we have conducted measurements for a range of dimensionless parameters physiologically relevant to the upper acini. Acinar airflow patterns were measured using a simplified in vitro alveolar model consisting of a single transparent elastic truncated sphere (representing the alveolus) mounted over a circular hole on the side of a rigid circular tube (representing the bronchiole). The model alveolus was capable of expanding and contracting in-phase with the oscillatory flow through the bronchiole thereby simulating synchronous ventilation. Realistic breathing conditions were achieved by exercising the model over a range of progressively varying geometric and dynamic parameters to simulate the environment within several generations of the acinar tree. Particle image velocimetry was used to measure the resulting flow patterns. Next, we used the measured flow fields to calculate particle trajectories to obtain particle transport and deposition statistics for massless and finite-size particles under the influence of flow advection and gravity. Our study shows that the geometric parameters (β and ΔV/V) primarily affect the velocity magnitudes, whereas the dynamic parameters (Re and α) distort the flow symmetry while also altering the velocity magnitudes. Consequently, the dynamic parameters have a greater influence on the particle trajectories and deposition statistics compared to the geometric parameters. The results from this study can benefit pulmonary research into the risk assessment of toxicological inhaled aerosols, and the pharmaceutical industry by providing better insight into the flow patterns and particle transport of inhalable therapeutics in the acini.","Chhabra, Sudhaker; Prasad, Ajay K",J Fluids Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164511/,150

The FIVpositive cats were divided into 3 groups: group I included asymptomatic carriers; group II comprised sick FIV‐infected cats with illnesses not likely to influence the hemostatic system; and group III included FIV‐positive cats with diseases potentially associated with coagulopathies. Platelet counts in FIV/FeLV‐infected cats were significantly lower than in healthy cats (P < .003), whereas the differences in the 3 groups of FIV‐positive cats were variable (group I, P= .009; II, P= .05; III, P= .09). Thrombocytopenia (< 145,000 platelets/μL) was present in 4 FIV‐positive and 3 FIV/FeLV‐positive cats. Platelet aggregation induced by collagen (0.5 and 0.25 μg/mL), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (1 and 0.6 μmol/L), and thrombin (0.4 and 0.25 IU/mL) was not significantly different from that of healthy cats. The plasma coagulation system was evaluated by measuring one‐stage prothrombin time (OSPT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time, fibrinogen concentration, coagulation factor assays, fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products (FDP), and plasma exchange test. The OSPT was similar in FlV‐seropositive cats and in the healthy control group. Cats with FIV infection, however, had markedly shorter clotting times than healthy cats when using a modified test system (P < .05). In all groups of FIV‐infected cats and in those with FIV/FeLV infection, APTT measured with 2 different commercially available tests, and a modified plasma assay was markedly prolonged compared with healthy cats (APTT1 and 2:3 modification: P < .01; APTT2: P < .05 except group III). In 22 of 40 cats with FIV and in 5 of 8 cats with FIV/FeLV infection, plasma samples were beyond the reference range. The thrombin time was also significantly prolonged in cats with FIV and FIV/FeLV infection (P < .01); values in 17 of 40 FIV‐positive cats were above reference range. The mean fibrinogen concentration of cats with FIV and FIV/FeLV infection was higher than in the healthy control group (P < .001). Factor VIII activity of 4 cats with FIV infection was 1.5 times higher than that of healthy cats. Factor XII activity of 3 cats from a group of 20 cats with prolonged APTT was between 20% and 35%. Factor IX and XI activities ranged between 70% and 120%. The markedly prolonged APTT in 2 FIV‐positive cats could be shortened considerably in a plasma exchange test using 20% feline pooled plasma. The alterations in the coagulogram of FIV‐seropositive cats were not related to a clinical stage or concurrent diseases. A definite explanation of the distinct disorder within the intrinsic plasma coagulation system in FIV‐infected cats was not found.","Hart, Stefan W.; Nolte, Ingo",J Vet Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167060/,150

10442,Complex Carbohydrates in Drug Development,2008-06-18,"The traffic among the cellular compartments is thought to be mediated by membrane vesicles, which bud from one compartment and fuse with the next. Despite the continuous exchange of membrane components among them, the organelles maintain their characteristic protein and lipid compositions such that the traffic remains selective, thus, avoiding intermixing of components. This membrane traffic recycles components from the cell surface to the interior of the cell and back to the cell surface again. The membrane traffic between the ER and the cell surface involves a major sorting problem. Little is known of how the animal cell has solved this problem in molecular terms. One experimental tool in this direction is provided by some enveloped animal viruses, which mature at the cell surface of infected cells. Such viruses include influenza virus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). They are extremely simple in makeup and hence are very well characterized. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the use of the enveloped viruses as tools in the study of membrane traffic in the animal cell. This is done in the context of the life cycle of the virus in the host cell. The article will be concerned mainly with Semliki Forest virus (SFV), which is the virus that has been worked upon in the chapter.

All except I. wasastjernae have a basic karyotype of 34 autosomes plus sex chromosomes which are X0 (♂), XX (♀), with the X chromosome among the largest in the nucleus. This karyotype appears to be the norm for Ilybius and supports the transfer of the species concerned from Agabus to Ilybius. I. wasastjernae has 36 autosomes and the X chromosome is the smallest in the nucleus and its karyotype is unlike any other known karyotype in either Ilybius or Agabus. In most of the species studied no intraspecific variation has been detected. Exceptions are I. chalconatus, where there is one inversion polymorphism in one of the autosomes, and I. montanus whose autosome number has been found to vary from 29 to 34. Such variation is highly unusual among Coleoptera. The variation results from fusion‐fission polymorphisms involving three different pairs of autosomes. In each case the fusions may be homozygous, heterozygous or absent. All populations investigated were polymorphic for some of the fusions, but only one (La Salceda, Spain) included individuals lacking all fusions. The frequencies of fused and unfused chromosomes were analysed in three English populations. In only one case was there a departure from the values expected from the Hardy‐Weinberg equilibrium, and this population also showed a significant difference from the other two. Meiosis in males heterozygous for fusions involves the production of trivalents in first division, but results in the production of abundant sperm, with no evidence of chromosomal abnormalities in second metaphase, or of degenerating cells as a result of failed meiosis. The three fusions sites are consistent in all the populations studied, and it is concluded that these fusions represent unique historical events rather than current chromosomal instability.","ARADOTTIR, G.

Multivariable analysis was used to compare laparoscopic and open, including abdominal and thoracic approaches, groups. The outcomes were postoperative complications and mortality. RESULTS: There were 1607 patients in the laparoscopic group and 366 in the open group, with 84.1% men and mean age of 61 years. Gender and body mass index did not influence the type of surgical approach. The mortality rates at 30 and 180 days were 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Postoperative complications, including reintubation (2.2%), pneumonia (2.0%), intubation > 48 h (2.0%), and sepsis (2.0%) were higher in the open group (15.9% versus 7.2%, p < 0.001). The laparoscopic group had a significantly shorter length of stay (4.3 versus 9.6 days, p < 0.001) and a lower percentage of return to surgery within 30 days (3.9% versus 8.2%, p < 0.001) than the open group. The ratio of open versus laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repairs varied significantly by different Veterans Integrated Services Network regions. CONCLUSIONS: Veterans undergoing laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair experience similar outcomes as patients in the private sector. Veterans who underwent laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair had significantly less complications compared to an open approach even after adjusting for patient comorbidities and demographics. The difference in open versus laparoscopic practices between various regions requires further investigation.","Chen, Sheena W.; Brody, Fred; Lee, K.

Human parvovirus B19 (B19V), human bocaviruses 1–4 (HBoV1–4), and human parvovirus 4 (hPARV4) are members of the Parvoviridae family and are associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations including neurological disorders. The main aim of this study was to determine whether human parvoviruses infection markers are present among patients with meningitis/meningoencephalitis in Latvia as well as to clarify the role of these viruses on the clinical course of the mentioned diseases. Our study revealed HBoV1–4 and B19V genomic sequences in 52.38% and 16.67% of patients, respectively. Furthermore, symptoms such as the presence of a headache and its severity, fatigue, disorientation, and difficulties to concentrate were significantly frequently present in patients with active parvovirus infection in comparison with parvoviruses negative patients, therefore we suggest that HBoV1–4 and B19V infection should be included in the diagnostics to reduce the number of meningitis/meningoencephalitis with unknown/unexplained etiology.","Vilmane, Anda; Terentjeva, Anna; Tamosiunas, Paulius L.; Suna, Normunds; Suna, Inga; Petraityte-Burneikiene, Rasa; Murovska, Modra; Rasa-Dzelzkaleja, Santa; Nora-Krukle, Zaiga",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7349785/,150

These materials, when incorporated into a polymer matrix, have properties showing increased flux, decreased membrane resistance, and improved clearance, making them an ideal material for dialysis. This study is the first to focus on the implementation of OTO-CNMs into hollow fiber membranes and a comparison of these membranes for ultrafiltration and dialysis. Ultrafiltration and dialysis were performed using bovine serum albumin (BSA), lysozyme, and urea to analyze various properties of each hollow fiber membrane type. The results presented in this study provide the first quantitative evaluation of the clearance and sieving characteristics of Oxone(®)-Mediated TEMPO-Oxidized Cellulose-Nanomaterial-doped cellulose triacetate mixed-matrix hemodialyzers. While the cellulose nanomaterials increased flux (10–30%) in ultrafiltration mode, this was offset by increased removal of albumin. However, in dialysis mode, these materials drastically increased the mass transfer of components (50–100%), which could lead to significantly lower dialysis times for patients. This change in the performance between the two different modes is most likely due to the increased porosity of the cellulose nanomaterials.","Moore, John P.; Robling, Kristyn; Romero, Cristian; Kiper, Keturah; Dachavaram, Soma Shekar; Crooks, Peter A.; Hestekin, Jamie A.",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7361684/,150

We aimed to assess the risk factors and overall mortality for MDR/XDR Acinetobacter baumannii infected pediatric patients. METHODS: This retrospective study included 102 pediatric patients who developed MDR/XDR Acinetobacter baumannii infection in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of Shanghai Children’s Hospital in China from December 2014 to May 2018. Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates were recovered from different specimens including blood, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, ascites, hydrothorax, and urine. Antibiotic susceptibility test was determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute interpretive criteria. Clinical and biological data were obtained from the patients’ medical records. RESULTS: 102 patients with Acinetobacter baumannii infection were enrolled. The median age was 36 (9.6, 98.8) months, and there were 63 male in the case group. The overall mortality rate was 29.4%, while the Acinetobacter baumannii-associated mortality rate was 16.7% (17/102, 12 bloodstream infections, 4 meningitis and 1 intra-abdominal infection). Bloodstream infections occurred in 28 patients (27.5%), and 10 patients (9.8%) among them had central line-associated bloodstream infections (6 central venous catheters, 2 PICCs, 1 venous infusion port and 1 arterial catheter). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures were positive in 4(3.9%) patients. 14(13.7%) patients got positive cultures in ascites and hydrothorax. Lower respiratory isolates (56/102) accounted for 54.9% of all patients. Non-survival patients appeared to have a lower NK cell activity (6.2% ± 3.61% vs. 9.15% ± 6.21%, P = 0.029), higher CD4+ T cell ratio (39.67% ± 12.18% vs. 32.66% ± 11.44%, P = 0.039),and a higher serum level of interlukin-8 (IL-8, 15.25 (1.62, 47.22)pg/mL vs. 0.1 (0.1, 22.99)pg/mL, P = 0.01) when Acinetobacter baumannii infection developed. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that high serum level of Cr (RR, 0.934, 95%CI, 0.890–0.981; P = 0.007) and high BUN/ALB level (RR, 107.893, 95%CI, 1.425–870.574; p = 0.005) were associated with high risk of mortality in MDR/XDR Acinetobacter baumannii infected patients. CONCLUSION: MDR/XDR Acinetobacter baumannii infection is a serious concern in pediatric patients with high mortality. Bloodstream and central nervous system infection accounted for high risk of death. Acute kidney injury is associated with high risk of mortality.","Shi, Jingyi; Sun, Ting; Cui, Yun; Wang, Chunxia; Wang, Fei; Zhou, Yiping; Miao, Huijie; Shan, Yijun; Zhang, Yucai",BMC Infectious Diseases,https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12879-020-05321-y,150

Here, to investigate whether oral supplementation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) [25(OH)D(3)], a major form of vitamin D metabolite 25(OH)D, has a prophylactic effect on influenza A virus infection, mice were fed a diet containing a high dose of 25(OH)D(3) and were challenged with the influenza virus. In the lungs of 25(OH)D(3)-fed mice, the viral titers were significantly lower than in the lungs of standardly fed mice. Additionally, the proinflammatory cytokines IL-5 and IFN-γ were significantly downregulated after viral infection in 25(OH)D(3)-fed mice, while anti-inflammatory cytokines were not significantly upregulated. These results indicate that 25(OH)D(3) suppresses the production of inflammatory cytokines and reduces virus replication and clinical manifestations of influenza virus infection in a mouse model.","Hayashi, Hirotaka; Okamatsu, Masatoshi; Ogasawara, Honami; Tsugawa, Naoko; Isoda, Norikazu; Matsuno, Keita; Sakoda, Yoshihiro",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7400405/,150

In the present study, nine husavirus strains were identified in China. Their genomes share 94.1–99.9% similarity, and alignment of these nine husavirus strains identified 697 nucleotide polymorphism sites across their full-length genomes. These nine strains were directly clustered with the Husavirus 1 lineage, and their genomic arrangement showed similar characteristics. These posa-like viruses have undergone a complex evolutionary process, and have a wide geographic distribution, complex host spectrum, deep phylogenetic divergence, and diverse genomic organizations. The clade of posa-like viruses forms a single group, which is evolutionarily distinct from other known families and could represent a distinct family within the Picornavirales. The genomic arrangement of Picornavirales and the new posa-like viruses are different, whereas the posa-like viruses have genomic modules similar to the families Dicistroviridae and Marnaviridae.

This study aimed to assess HL among undergraduates from healthcare and non-healthcare degree courses of two Italian universities and the association between their HL, lifestyles, and BMI assumed as health outcome. Methods: The Health Literacy Assessment Tool (HLAT-8) and the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) were used to assess health literacy dimensions. Demographic and anthropometric data, adherence to Mediterranean diet (MD), physical activity levels, and smoking habits were assessed in the enrolled sample to highlight possible associations. Results: A total sample of 806 undergraduates (46% males, mean age 21.01 ± 1.78 years) was recruited. Higher HL scores were found among healthcare rather than non-healthcare students (28.7 ± 4.5 vs. 26.7 ± 4.2 for HLAT-8 and 4.9 ± 1.5 vs. 3.9 ± 1.8 for NVS, p < 0.01). However, healthcare undergraduates were more likely to report unhealthy behaviors. Body Mass Index (BMI) was associated with literacy and numeracy skills only in non-healthcare undergraduates. Significant associations were found between HL scores and adherence to MD in both groups. In the regression analysis, educational field and MD were shown to be predictors of HL scores. Conclusions: Attending a healthcare related degree course was associated with higher HL scores but not with healthy behaviors. This issue should be addressed considering the role that healthcare professionals may have in educating patients towards a healthy lifestyle. Adherence to MD seems to be related to higher HL scores.","Gallè, Francesca; Calella, Patrizia; Napoli, Christian; Liguori, Fabrizio; Parisi, Eduardo Alfonso; Orsi, Giovanni Battista; Liguori, Giorgio; Valerio, Giuliana",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7558704/,150

Spinal cord ischemia is a rarer pathology, compared with cerebral ischemia, yet the morbidity and mortality are comparable in both cases; furthermore, classifying the acute loss of function in the spine, encountered in spinal cord ischemia as an important neurological entity. SDAVF presents the same clinical symptoms as spinal cord ischemia, but even though it has a progressive character, the impact in the quality of patients’ lives being equally as important. Between August 2012–August 2017 we admitted through the hospital emergency department 21 patients with spinal cord ischemia and 11 patients with SDAVF (only self-casuistry). Demographic (age, gender), clinical, imagistic (Magnetic Resonance Angiography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging), paraclinical data as well as history, time to diagnosis, the visual analogue scale for pain (VAS score), risk factors, surgical and medical treatment, evolution, neurorehabilitation, were all used to compare the two lots of patients. The aim of this study was to observe potential differences in the demographics, symptomatology, VAS scores and treatment in comparison for spinal cord ischemia and SDAVF, to facilitate the further recognition and management in these diseases. In group A we have 21 patients with spinal cord ischemia (14 females, 7 males). The median age was 41.3 years (range 19–64). The median time to diagnosis was 7 h. The most frequent symptoms were acute neck or back pain at onset (100%), motor deficits (95.24%), sensory loss (85.72%), and sphincters problems (90.48%). The most common location was the lumbosacral spine (14 cases; 66.67%; p-value = 0.03) for spinal cord ischemia and the thoracic spine (7 cases, 63.64%; p-value = 0.065) for SDAVF. The treatment of spinal cord ischemia was medical. In group B we included 11 patients (6 females, 5 males). The median age was 52.6 years (range 28–74). The median time to diagnosis was 3 months (range 2 days–14 months). Patients have progressive symptoms: neck or back pain (100%), gait disturbances (100%) and abnormalities of micturition (100%). The treatment of SDAVF was surgical occlusion of fistula. The proportion of severe VAS score (7–10) in patients with spinal cord ischemia was significantly higher than that in patients with SDAVF (100% vs. 18, 19%; p-value = 0.051). Taking into consideration that the usual findings and diagnosis of spinal cord ischemia and SDAVF are still challenging for neurologists and in some cases the difficulties are related to technical limitations, we consider these entities to be rare but very important for the life of our patients. Patients were grouped into spinal cord ischemia and SDAVF status and those with acute or chronic pain conditions, measured by the VAS score. Patients with spinal cord ischemia develop acute neurological symptoms. They are much younger than the patients with SDAVF and the recovery rate is higher. Patients with SDAVF develop a progressive myelopathy and they suffer considerable neurological deficits. Imaging the lesions with MR angiography or MRI, we can confirm the diagnosis.","Gogu, Anca Elena; Pusztai, Agneta; Stroe, Alina Zorina; Docu Axelerad, Daniel; Docu Axelerad, Any",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7564190/,150

As a prime instance, we present a computationally ultraefficient implementation using the rare-variant collapsing test for phenotypic association, the genomic exhaustive collapsing scan (GECS). Our implementation allows for the identification of regions comprising the strongest signals in large, genome-wide rare-variant association studies while controlling the family-wise error rate via permutation. Application of GECS to two genomic data sets revealed several novel significantly associated regions for age-related macular degeneration and for schizophrenia.

Recent studies have revealed novel roles of epigenetic dysregulation in altering the phenotypes of immune cells and tumor-associated stromal cells, including fibroblasts and endothelial cells. As a result, epigenetic dysregulation of these cells reshapes the tumor microenvironment (TME), changing it from an antitumor environment to an immunosuppressive environment. Here, we review recent studies demonstrating how specific epigenetic mechanisms drive aspects of stromal and immune cell differentiation with implications for the development of solid tumor therapeutics, focusing on the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) TME as a representative of solid tumors. Due to their unique ability to reprogram the TME into a more immunopermissive environment, epigenetic agents have great potential for sensitizing cancer immunotherapy to augment the antitumor response, as an immunopermissive TME is a prerequisite for the success of cancer immunotherapy but is often not developed with solid tumors. The idea of combining epigenetic agents with cancer immunotherapy has been tested both in preclinical settings and in multiple clinical trials. In this review, we highlight the basic biological mechanisms underlying the synergy between epigenetic therapy and immunotherapy and discuss current efforts to translate this knowledge into clinical benefits for patients.","Pan, Xingyi; Zheng, Lei",Cell Mol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7609272/,150

Cellulose itself is not suitable for electrospun nanofibers’ formation due to high swelling, viscosity, and lower conductivity. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is also super hydrophilic polymer, however it has the same trend for nanofibers formation as that of cellulose. Due to the above-stated reasons, applications of CMC are quite limited in nanotechnology. In recent research, loading of CMC was optimized for electrospun tri-component polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) nanofibers aim at widening its area of applications. PVA is a water-soluble polymer with a wide range of applications in water filtration, biomedical, and environmental engineering, and with the advantage of easy process ability. However, it was observed that only PVA was not sufficient to produce PVA/CMC nanofibers via electrospinning. To increase spinnability of PVA/CMC nanofibers, PVP was selected as the best available option because of its higher conductivity and water solubility. Weight ratios of CMC and PVP were optimized to produce uniform nanofibers with continuous production as well.

This approach reveals the qualitative and quantitative correlations between the morphological features of the hybrid structures with their magnetic response. The suppression of the high-frequency peak in the magnetic response and the appearance of a new peak at lower frequencies match the formation of larger sized assemblies upon increasing the concentration of DNA-coils. Furthermore, an increase of the DNA-coil concentration induces an increase in the number of MNPs per hybrid structure.

In this study, we used a novel spatial profiling tool, the Nanostring GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) technology, to profile non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for protein markers across immune cell typing, immune activation, drug targets, and tumour modules. Comparative analysis was performed between the tumour, adjacent tissue, and microenvironment to identify markers enriched in these areas with spatial resolution. Our study reveals that this methodology can be a powerful tool for determining the expression of a large number of protein markers from a single tissue slide. ABSTRACT: Profiling the tumour microenvironment (TME) has been informative in understanding the underlying tumour–immune interactions. Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) coupled with molecular barcoding technologies have revealed greater insights into the TME. In this study, we utilised the Nanostring GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) platform to profile a non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue microarray for protein markers across immune cell profiling, immuno-oncology (IO) drug targets, immune activation status, immune cell typing, and pan-tumour protein modules. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected that described tumour, TME, and normal adjacent tissue (NAT) compartments. Our data revealed that paired analysis (n = 18) of matched patient compartments indicate that the TME was significantly enriched in CD27, CD3, CD4, CD44, CD45, CD45RO, CD68, CD163, and VISTA relative to the tumour. Unmatched analysis indicated that the NAT (n = 19) was significantly enriched in CD34, fibronectin, IDO1, LAG3, ARG1, and PTEN when compared to the TME (n = 32). Univariate Cox proportional hazards indicated that the presence of cells expressing CD3 (hazard ratio (HR): 0.5, p = 0.018), CD34 (HR: 0.53, p = 0.004), and ICOS (HR: 0.6, p = 0.047) in tumour compartments were significantly associated with improved overall survival (OS).

15121,Perspectives on the Biological Role of Chemokine:Glycosaminoglycan Interactions,2020-12-07,"After an epidemic outbreak, the infection persists in a community long enough to engulf the entire susceptible population. Local extinction of the disease could be possible if the susceptible population gets depleted. In large communities, the tendency of eventual damp down of recurrent epidemics is balanced by random variability. But, in small communities, the infection would die out when the number of susceptible falls below a certain threshold. Critical community size (CCS) is considered to be the mentioned threshold, at which the infection is as likely as not to die out after a major epidemic for small communities unless reintroduced from outside. The determination of CCS could aid in devising systematic control strategies to eradicate the infectious disease from small communities. In this article, we have come up with a simplified computation based approach to deduce the CCS of HIV disease dynamics. We consider a deterministic HIV model proposed by Silva and Torres, and following Nåsell, introduce stochasticity in the model through time-varying population sizes of different compartments. Besides, Metcalf’s group observed that the relative risk of extinction of some infections on islands is almost double that in the mainlands i.e. infections cease to exist at a significantly higher rate in islands compared to the mainlands. They attributed this phenomenon to the greater recolonization in the mainlands. Interestingly, the application of our method on demographic facts and figures of countries in the AIDS belt of Africa led us to expect that existing control measures and isolated locations would assist in temporary eradication of HIV infection much faster. For example, our method suggests that through systematic control strategies, after 7.36 years HIV epidemics will temporarily be eradicated from different communes of island nation Madagascar, where the population size falls below its CCS value, unless the disease is reintroduced from outside.","Das, Sarmistha; Ghosh, Pramit; Banerjee, Sandip; Pyne, Saumyadipta; Chattopadhyay, Joydev; Mukhopadhyay, Indranil",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7842972/,150

Two doses of the vaccine provides 100% protection when administered intranasally against challenge with Yersinia pestis CO92 or its isogenic F1 mutant in short- or long- term immunization in pneumonic/bubonic plague models. The corresponding protection rates drop in rAd5-LcrV monovalent vaccinated mice in plague models. The rAd5-YFV vaccine induces superior humoral, mucosal and cell-mediated immunity, with clearance of the pathogen. Immunization of mice with rAd5-YFV followed by CO92 infection dampens proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophil chemoattractant production, while increasing Th1- and Th2-cytokine responses as well as macrophage/monocyte chemo-attractants when compared to the challenge control animals. This is a first study showing complete protection of mice from pneumonic/bubonic plague with a viral vector-based vaccine without the use of needles and the adjuvant.","Kilgore, Paul B.; Sha, Jian; Andersson, Jourdan A.; Motin, Vladimir L.; Chopra, Ashok K.",NPJ Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7846801/,150

This propagates a chronic low-grade inflammation associated with increased signaling of common inflammatory pathways such as NF-κB and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Obesity-associated inflammation is linked to an increased risk of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Preclinical rodent and cell culture studies provide robust evidence that berries and their bioactive components have beneficial effects not only on inflammation, but also on biomarkers of many of these chronic diseases. Berries contain an abundance of bioactive compounds that have been shown to inhibit inflammation and to reduce reactive oxygen species. Therefore, berries represent an intriguing possibility for the treatment of obesity-induced inflammation and associated comorbidities. This review summarizes the anti-inflammatory properties of blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries. This review highlights the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of berries and their bioactive components that have been elucidated through the use of preclinical models. The primary mechanisms mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of berries include a reduction in NF-κB signaling that may be secondary to reduced oxidative stress, a down-regulation of TLR4 signaling, and an increase in Nrf2.","Land Lail, Hannah; Feresin, Rafaela G.; Hicks, Dominique; Stone, Blakely; Price, Emily; Wanders, Desiree",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912458/,150

As it has been estimated, its mortality will double by 2040, mostly in countries with limited resources. These numbers suggest that recent trends in deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis could play an important role, serving as screening methods for PCa detection. These algorithms have already been used with histopathological images in many works, in which authors tend to focus on achieving high accuracy results for classifying between malignant and normal cases. These results are commonly obtained by training very deep and complex convolutional neural networks, which require high computing power and resources not only in this process, but also in the inference step. As the number of cases rises in regions with limited resources, reducing prediction time becomes more important. In this work, we measured the performance of current state-of-the-art models for PCa detection with a novel benchmark and compared the results with PROMETEO, a custom architecture that we proposed. The results of the comprehensive comparison show that using dedicated models for specific applications could be of great importance in the future.","Duran-Lopez, Lourdes; Dominguez-Morales, Juan P.; Rios-Navarro, Antonio; Gutierrez-Galan, Daniel; Jimenez-Fernandez, Angel; Vicente-Diaz, Saturnino; Linares-Barranco, Alejandro",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7915373/,150
15979,Retrograde ERK activation waves drive base-to-apex multicellular flow in murine cochlear duct morphogenesis,2021-03-05,"HLA-C arose during evolution of pregnancy in the great apes 10 to 15 million years ago. It has a dual function on placental extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) as it contributes to both tolerance and immunity at the maternal–fetal interface. The mode of its regulation is of considerable interest in connection with the biology of pregnancy and pregnancy abnormalities. First-trimester primary EVTs in which HLA-C is highly expressed, as well as JEG3, an EVT model cell line, were employed. Single-cell RNA-seq data and quantitative PCR identified high expression of the transcription factor ELF3 in those cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR confirmed that both ELF3 and MED1 bound to the proximal HLA-C promoter region. However, binding of RFX5 to this region was absent or severely reduced, and the adjacent HLA-B locus remained closed. Expression of HLA-C was inhibited by ELF3 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and by wrenchnolol treatment. Wrenchnolol is a cell-permeable synthetic organic molecule that mimics ELF3 and is relatively specific for binding to ELF3’s coactivator, MED23, as our data also showed in JEG3. Moreover, the ELF3 gene is regulated by a superenhancer that spans more than 5 Mb, identified by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), as well as by its sensitivity to (+)-JQ1 (inhibitor of BRD4). ELF3 bound to its own promoter, thus creating an autoregulatory feedback loop that establishes expression of ELF3 and HLA-C in trophoblasts. Wrenchnolol blocked binding of MED23 to ELF3, thus disrupting the positive-feedback loop that drives ELF3 expression, with down-regulation of HLA-C expression as a consequence.","Li, Qin; Meissner, Torsten B.; Wang, Fang; Du, Ziming; Ma, Sai; Kshirsagar, Sarika; Tilburgs, Tamara; Buenrostro, Jason D.; Uesugi, Motonari; Strominger, Jack L.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7936349/,150

16261,A single arm trial using passive simulated jogging for blunting acute hyperglycemia,2021-03-19,"BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as one of the common multidrug resistance pathogens causing hospital-acquired infections. This study was conducted to elucidate the distribution of antimicrobial resistance genes in the bacterial population in Thailand. Multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (MDR A. baumannii) isolates were characterized phenotypically, and the molecular epidemiology of clinical isolates in 11 tertiary hospitals was investigated at a country-wide level. METHODS: A total of 135 nonrepetitive MDR A. baumannii isolates collected from tertiary care hospitals across 5 regions of Thailand were examined for antibiotic susceptibility, resistance genes, and sequence types. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed to characterize the spread of regional lineages. RESULTS: ST2 belonging to IC2 was the most dominant sequence type in Thailand (65.19%), and to a lesser extent, there was also evidence of the spread of ST164 (10.37%), ST129 (3.70%), ST16 (2.96%), ST98 (2.96%), ST25 (2.96%), ST215 (2.22%), ST338 (1.48%), and ST745 (1.48%). The novel sequence types ST1551, ST1552, ST1553, and ST1557 were also identified in this study. Among these, the blaoxa-23 gene was by far the most widespread in MDR A. baumannii, while the blaoxa-24/40 and blaoxa-58 genes appeared to be less dominant in this region. The results demonstrated that the predominant class D carbapenemase was blaOXA-23, followed by the class B carbapenemase blaNDM-like, while the mcr-1 gene was not observed in any isolate. Most of the MDR A. baumannii isolates were resistant to ceftazidime (99.23%), gentamicin (91.85%), amikacin (82.96%), and ciprofloxacin (97.78%), while all of them were resistant to carbapenems. The results suggested that colistin could still be effective against MDR A. baumannii in this region. CONCLUSION: This is the first molecular epidemiological analysis of MDR A. baumannii clinical isolates at the national level in Thailand to date. Studies on the clonal relatedness of MDR A. baumannii isolates could generate useful data to understand the local epidemiology and international comparisons of nosocomial outbreaks.

The present study was undertaken to assess the therapeutic response of TCZ therapy in severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients and its role as an effective modality of management. Methods: The present retrospective observational study included 30 admitted severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients, treated with TCZ therapy on behalf of raised IL-6 levels. The patients’ data concerning medical history, clinical manifestation, arterial blood gas analysis, mode of oxygenation, radiological imaging, and outcome were extracted from their medical records and compared pre- and post-TCZ infusion. Results: All patients of the study group had symptomatic presentations with a mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio of 205.41 before TCZ infusion. All patients had a raised IL-6 level (mean value 206.56 pg/mL) that was extremely elevated in 90% of patients. Infusion of TCZ dramatically reduced mean body temperature (100.78–99.32°F) and the requirement for supplemental oxygen (68–48%) and improved mean SpO(2) (86–89%) and mean P/F ratio (208–240) within 24 hours. Three patients on noninvasive ventilation were weaned off after TCZ infusion. Serum levels of IL-6 were raised initially but declined within 3–5 days of post-TCZ infusion. Conclusion: TCZ appears to be an effective therapeutic option in severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients with raised IL-6 levels. TCZ immediately improves the clinical status of patients by a probable mechanism of inhibition of cytokine storm and reduces COVID-19-related mortalities.

Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are common around the globe, posing a critical healthcare issue and financial burden to the country. However, integrative evidence implies some common shared mechanisms and pathways in NDs, which include mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, intracellular calcium overload, protein aggregates, oxidative stress (OS), and neuronal destruction in specific regions of the brain, owing to multifaceted pathologies. The co-existence of these multiple pathways often limits the advantages of available therapies. The nutraceutical-based approach has opened the doors to target these common multifaceted pathways in a slow and more physiological manner to starve the NDs. Peer-reviewed articles were searched via MEDLINE and PubMed published to date for in-depth research and database collection. Considered to be complementary therapy with current clinical management and common drug therapy, the intake of nutraceuticals is considered safe to target multiple mechanisms of action in NDs. The current review summarizes the popular nutraceuticals showing different effects (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuro-protectant, mitochondrial homeostasis, neurogenesis promotion, and autophagy regulation) on vital molecular mechanisms involved in NDs, which can be considered as complementary therapy to first-line treatment. Moreover, owing to its natural source, lower toxicity, therapeutic interventions, biocompatibility, potential nutritional effects, and presence of various anti-oxidative and neuroprotective constituents, the nutraceuticals serve as an attractive option to tackle NDs.","Behl, Tapan; Kaur, Gagandeep; Sehgal, Aayush; Singh, Sukhbir; Bhatia, Saurabh; Al-Harrasi, Ahmed; Zengin, Gokhan; Bungau, Simona Gabriela; Munteanu, Mihai Alexandru; Brisc, Mihaela Cristina; Andronie-Cioara, Felicia Liana; Brisc, Ciprian",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8070907/,150

For the aforementioned reasons, the study of large conformational changes in proteins has been an interest to researchers for years. However, since some proteins experience rapid and transient conformational changes, it is hard to experimentally capture the intermediate structures. Additionally, computational brute force methods are computationally intractable, which makes it impossible to find these pathways which require a search in a high-dimensional, complex space. In our previous work, we implemented a hybrid algorithm that combines Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling and RRT*, a version of the Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT) robotics-based method, to make the conformational exploration more accurate and efficient, and produce smooth conformational pathways. In this work, we integrated the rigidity analysis of proteins into our algorithm to guide the search to explore flexible regions.

17536,Kaolin based protective barrier in municipal landfills against adverse chemo-mechanical loadings,2021-05-14,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Prognosis for patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains poor mainly due to late diagnosis and limited curative treatment options. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) plus surgery is considered the standard of care for patients with locally advanced ESCC. Currently, predicting prognosis remains a challenging task. Quantitative imaging radiomics analysis has shown promising results, but these methods are traditionally data-intensive, requiring a large sample size, and are not necessarily based on the underlying biology. Feature selection based on genomics is proposed in this work, leveraging differentially expressed genes to reduce the number of radiomic features allowing for the creation of a CT-based radiomic model using the genomics-based feature selection method. The established radiomic signature was prognostic for patients’ long-term survival. The radiomic nomogram could provide a valuable prediction for individualized long-term survival. ABSTRACT: Purpose: To evaluate the prognostic value of baseline and restaging CT-based radiomics with features associated with gene expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) plus surgery. Methods: We enrolled 106 ESCC patients receiving nCRT from two institutions. Gene expression profiles of 28 patients in the training set were used to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes between patients with and without relapse. Radiomic features that were correlated to DE genes were selected, followed by additional machine learning selection. A radiomic nomogram for disease-free survival (DFS) prediction incorporating the radiomic signature and prognostic clinical characteristics was established for DFS estimation and validated. Results: The radiomic signature with DE genes feature selection achieved better performance for DFS prediction than without. The nomogram incorporating the radiomic signature and lymph nodal status significantly stratified patients into high and low-risk groups for DFS (p < 0.001). The areas under the curve (AUCs) for predicting 5-year DFS were 0.912 in the training set, 0.852 in the internal test set, 0.769 in the external test set. Conclusions: Genomics association was useful for radiomic feature selection. The established radiomic signature was prognostic for DFS.

The WHO recognizes 17 public registries as Primary Registries, and has also introduced a set of minimal standards in the International Standards for Clinical Trial Registries (ISCTR) that primary registries need to implement. These standards are categorized into nine sections—Content, Quality and Validity, Accessibility, Unambiguous Identification, Technical Capacity, Administration and Governance, the Trial Registration Data Set (TRDS), Partner registries and Data Interchange Standards. This study compared the WHO’s primary registries, and the US’s ClinicalTrials.gov, to examine the implementation of ISCTR, with the aim of defining features of an interim ideal registry. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The websites of the 18 registries were evaluated for 14 features that map to one or more of the nine sections of ISCTR, and assigned scores for their variations of these features. The assessed features include the nature of the content; the number and nature of fields to conduct a search; data download formats; the nature of the audit trail; the health condition category; the documentation available on a registry website; etc. The registries received scores for their particular variation of a given feature based on a scoring rationale devised for each individual feature analysed. Overall, the registries received between 27% and 80% of the maximum score of 94. The results from our analysis were used to define a set of features of an interim ideal registry. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the widely divergent quality of the primary registries’ compliance with the ISCTR. Even with this limited assessment, it is clear that some of the registries have much work to do, although even a few improvements would significantly improve them.","Venugopal, Nisha; Saberwal, Gayatri",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8112656/,150

Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) overcomes many such barriers, and is effective for treating depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to fill a gap in the literature regarding the use of ICBT tailored specifically for PSP. We examined the effectiveness of a tailored ICBT program for treating depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms among PSP in the province of Saskatchewan. METHODS: We employed a longitudinal single-group open-trial design (N=83) with outcome measures administered at screening and at 8 weeks posttreatment. Data were collected between December 5, 2019 and September 11, 2020. Primary outcomes included changes in depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Secondary outcomes included changes in functional impairment; symptoms of panic, social anxiety, and anger; as well as treatment satisfaction, working alliance, and program usage patterns. RESULTS: Clients reported large symptom reductions on measures of depression and anxiety, as well as moderate reductions on measures of PTSD and secondary symptoms, except for social anxiety. Most clients who reported symptoms above clinical cut-offs on measures of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during screening experienced clinically significant symptom reductions. Results suggested good engagement, treatment satisfaction, and working alliance. CONCLUSIONS: Tailored, transdiagnostic ICBT demonstrated promising outcomes as a treatment for depression, anxiety, and PTSD among Saskatchewan PSP and warrants further investigation.

During the placement, NQNs were supposed to be supervised and supported by professional nurses. On the contrary, professional nurses expected NQNs to be hands-on and provide quality care on completion of their training. Expectations of professional nurses created misperceptions regarding the objectives of community service. Therefore, exploring their experience would identify skills gap that is needed to be addressed. OBJECTIVES: This study explored and described the experiences of professional nurses working with NQNs placed for community service in the City of Tshwane. METHOD: A qualitative exploratory design was conducted. Individual interviews were carried out with 22 professional nurses in various public healthcare settings, such as a hospital, a community health centre and a clinic. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants and confidentiality and anonymity were maintained throughout the interviews. Creswell’s data analysis process was implemented. RESULTS: Two themes emerged from this study, namely, experience of participants with NQNs and professional nurses. Participants experienced NQNs as not being competent to work independently and had to deal with unprofessional behaviour of NQNs.

Immune dysfunction of adipose tissue is involved in the occurrence and prognosis of influenza viral pneumonia. In this study, we analyzed intestinal and adipose immune responses in mice infected with influenza virus and found that the impairment of intestinal and adipose immunity to influenza virus infection could be reversed by treatment with puerarin, a medicinal compound isolated from Pueraria lobata (called “gegen” in Chinese). We found that the lungs, small intestines (duodenum, ileum, jejunum) and large intestines (colon and rectum) of infected mice showed obvious inflammatory lesions, with significantly increased levels of virus, inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor-α), Toll-like receptors 3, 4, and 9, and integrin αvβ3 and α4, and a decreased level of secreted IgA compared to the normal control group (NC) (P < 0.05-0.001). Influenza virus infected mesenteric lymph nodes and adipose tissue, and adipokines (leptin, visfatin, “chemerin”, and adiponectin) of lung and mesenteric adipose tissue were dysregulated. Puerarin treatment reversed the impairment of the intestinal and adipose immune responses in mice infected with influenza virus. Our findings suggest that influenza virus can infect adipose tissue and lead to intestinal adipose immune dysfunction in normal-weight mice and that the impairment of the intestinal and adipose immune response to influenza virus infection can be reversed by puerarin treatment.","Zeng, Mao-Seng; Yu, Wen-Di; Wang, Hui-Xian; Xu, Pei-Ping; Liu, Jin-Yuan",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8191723/,150

A 65-year-old man with refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) presented typical MRI features of MERS. The patient's cerebrospinal fluid contained an increased number of reactive T-cells; a small number of MCL cells were detected by immunoglobulin heavy chain-polymerase chain reaction (IGH-PCR). His symptoms and the splenial lesion resolved in response to ibrutinib treatment, although the patient eventually died of progressive MCL with overt leptomeningeal disease. We suggest that central nervous system involvement in MCL can present clinicoradiological features of MERS and that ibrutinib could be a choice of treatment.","Nakamura, Makoto; Iwasa, Hitomi; Kojima, Kensuke",Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8188036/,150
18868,VENTILATION: WHY does no one take it seriously?,2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND: Youth with disabilities are a marginalised group in society. This marginalisation traps them and prevents their full participation in social and economic development. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to understand how exposure to the Performing Arts facilitates the inclusion of youth with disabilities. METHODS: The study adopted a qualitative research approach, utilising critical ethnography. Primary data consisted of three focus group discussions with youth with disabilities, and an in-depth interview with a performer with disability. Thematic data analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Four themes emerged. Theme 1, Blown away, shares the experiences of youth who attended Artscape Theatre. Theme 2, I can do it, you can do it, describes their career aspirations. Theme 3, Embracing hope, identifies the social and life skills learned through visited Artscape. Theme 4, Long way to go, presents the factors that influence the participation of youth with disabilities in the Performing Arts. While their experiences are diverse, and their impairments are unique, contact with the Performing Arts supported social and economic inclusion, and triggered empowerment of youth with disabilities. Insufficient accessible and available transportation is the most notable barrier to accessing development opportunities. CONCLUSION: Exposure to the Performing Arts provides important skills development and social opportunities for disabled youth. It is up to the ‘keepers’ of the Performing Arts – those in administration and management – to realign the Performing Arts in a way that can best benefit everyone.","le Roux, Marlene; Kathard, Harsha; Lorenzo, Theresa",Afr J Disabil,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8252130/,150
18980,Enhanced extraction of skin interstitial fluid using a 3D printed device enabling tilted microneedle penetration,2021-07-07,"Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory noncommunicable disease that affects all parts of the periodontium and causes irreversible damage. It is estimated that around 10 million people in Germany suffer from severe forms of periodontitis. The disease usually shows few or only mild symptoms over many years, which are often not perceived or correctly classified by the patient. A lack of awareness could lead to dental treatment being sought in an advanced stage of the disease when extensive therapeutic measures have become necessary and the prognosis for tooth retention has worsened. The periodontal screening index (PSI) is a simple and rapid tool that is used to assess the level of further examination needed. The index is now carried out on many patients. However, the number of treatments remain low and behind what is necessary to reduce the existing burden of periodontitis. Every dental practice must be able to implement periodontal therapy in their clinical setting. Periodontal specialists can support general dentists significantly, especially in the treatment of severe forms of periodontitis. This requires an upgrading of the subject in university education, but also an increasing postgraduate differentiation of specialized dentists for periodontology. The new treatment guidelines for PAR (periodontal) therapy allow periodontal treatment on the basis of internationally recognized scientific standards and thus improve the framework conditions for therapy in the dental practice.","Dannewitz, Bettina; Holtfreter, Birte; Eickholz, Peter",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8264996/,150

Socioeconomic determinants have an important role in sustainable development, while regional integration has fueled up the development process. The sample is based on 64 Belt and Road (BRI) countries from 2003–2018. Pair-wise correlation results indicate that human development, health expenditure and age structure showed a positive relationship with sustainable development. Two-step System-GMM direct effect outcomes are mixed and reveal that human development, health expenditure per capita, age structure, governance index and population size have a positive impact on sustainable development. On the other hand, e-government, government size, and globalization showed negative effects on SD. Apart from that, the moderating channel of regional integration (RI), interaction term with human development and health expenditure, showed a significant and positive impact on sustainable development. However, age structure interaction with regional integration showed a negative impact on SD. Other socio-economic factors, i.e., governance index and population contribute positively towards SD. It can be concluded that the dynamic nature of sustainable development is positive and the net present value is increasing. Therefore, BRI countries are on the sustainable path from 2003–2018, as suggested by economic and social welfare theory. The integration of BRI can be labeled as an entrance to successful sustainable development. However, weak e-government systems, globalization and government resources need to be utilized amicably in Belt and Road countries. Driscoll-Kraay standard-errors regression confirmed and validated the two-step System-GMM results. The findings of the current research have important policy implications for balanced and sustainable growth.","Ullah, Atta; Pinglu, Chen; Ullah, Saif; Hashmi, Shujahat Haider",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8270197/,150

An imbalance of gut bacteria has been linked to the development of disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, immunodeficiency, hypertension, type-2-diabetes, obesity, and cancer. This review outlines current knowledge from in vitro and in vivo studies concerning the potential therapeutic application of seaweed-derived polysaccharides, polyphenols and peptides to modulate the gut microbiota through diet. Polysaccharides such as fucoidan, laminarin, alginate, ulvan and porphyran are unique to seaweeds. Several studies have shown their potential to act as prebiotics and to positively modulate the gut microbiota. Prebiotics enhance bacterial populations and often their production of short chain fatty acids, which are the energy source for gastrointestinal epithelial cells, provide protection against pathogens, influence immunomodulation, and induce apoptosis of colon cancer cells. The oral bioaccessibility and bioavailability of seaweed components is also discussed, including the advantages and limitations of static and dynamic in vitro gastrointestinal models versus ex vivo and in vivo methods. Seaweed bioactives show potential for use in prevention and, in some instances, treatment of human disease. However, it is also necessary to confirm these potential, therapeutic effects in large-scale clinical trials. Where possible, we have cited information concerning these trials.","Shannon, Emer; Conlon, Michael; Hayes, Maria",Mar Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8303941/,150

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review from 2016 to 2020 was performed to evaluate clinical and imaging response to percutaneous cryoablation in 11 symptomatic patients with diagnosis of chondroblastoma and osteoblastoma treated from two pediatric hospitals with at least 12-month follow-up. Technical success (correct needle placement and potential full coverage of the tumor with the planned ablation zone) and clinical success (relief of the symptoms) were evaluated. The primary objective was to alleviate pain related to the lesion(s). Immediate and late complications were recorded. Patients were followed in clinic and with imaging studies such as MRI or CT for a minimum of 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 11 patients were included (mean 14 years, age range 9–17; male n = 8). Diagnoses were osteoblastoma (n = 4) and chondroblastoma (n = 7). Locations were proximal humerus (n = 1), femur condyle (n = 1), and proximal femur (n = 1) tibia (n = 3), acetabulum (n = 3), thoracic vertebra (n = 1) and lumbar vertebra (n = 1). Cryoablation was technically successful in all patients. Clinical success (cessation of pain) was achieved in all patients. No signs of recurrence were observed on imaging follow-up in any of the patients. One of the patients developed periprocedural right L2–L3 transient radiculopathy as major immediate complication.

Since a systematic and direct comparison of the specific activities and properties of the secretory DNase1 family members is still missing, we expressed and purified recombinant murine DNase1 (rmDNase1), DNase1-like 2 (rmDNase1L2) and DNase1-like 3 (rmDNase1L3) using Pichia pastoris. Employing different strategies for optimizing culture and purification conditions, we achieved yields of pure protein between ~3 mg/l (rmDNase1L2 and rmDNase1L3) and ~9 mg/l (rmDNase1) expression medium. Furthermore, we established a procedure for post-expressional maturation of pre-mature DNase still bound to an unprocessed tri-N-glycosylated pro-peptide of the yeast α-mating factor. We analyzed glycosylation profiles and determined specific DNase activities by the hyperchromicity assay. Additionally, we evaluated substrate specificities under various conditions at equimolar DNase isoform concentrations by lambda DNA and chromatin digestion assays in the presence and absence of heparin and monomeric skeletal muscle α-actin. Our results suggest that due to its biochemical properties mDNase1L2 can be regarded as an evolutionary intermediate isoform of mDNase1 and mDNase1L3. Consequently, our data show that the secretory DNase1 family members complement each other to achieve optimal DNA degradation and chromatinolysis under a broad spectrum of biological conditions.","Verhülsdonk, Lukas; Mannherz, Hans Georg; Napirei, Markus",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8323900/,150

We sought to describe the dynamics of respiratory involvement in children hospitalized with gastrointestinal (GI) diarrheal disease. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational longitudinal study of Malawian children 2–24 months hospitalized with diarrhea. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, induced sputum and stool specimens were collected. Participants that were positive by Cryptosporidium PCR in any of the three compartments were followed up with fortnightly visits up to 8 weeks post-enrollment. RESULTS: Of the 162 children recruited, participants had mild-moderate malnutrition (mean HAZ -1.6 (SD 2.1)), 37 (21%) were PCR-positive for Cryptosporidium at enrollment (37 stool, 11 sputum, and 4 NP) and 27 completed the majority of follow-up visits (73%). Cryptosporidium was detected in all compartments over the 4 post-enrollment visits, most commonly in stool (100% at enrollment with mean cycle thresholds (Ct) of 28.8±4.3 to 44% at 8 weeks with Ct 29.9±4.1), followed by sputum (31% at enrollment with mean Ct 31.1±4.4 to 20% at 8 weeks with Ct 35.7±2.6), then NP (11% with mean Ct 33.5±1.0 to 8% with Ct 36.6±0.7). Participants with Cryptosporidium detection in both the respiratory and GI tract over the study period reported respiratory and GI symptoms in 81% and 62% of study visits, respectively, compared to 68% and 27%, respectively, for those with only GI detection, and had longer GI shedding (17.5±6.6 v. 15.9±2.9 days). CONCLUSION: Cryptosporidium was detected in both respiratory and GI tracts throughout the 8 weeks post-enrollment. The development of therapeutics for Cryptosporidium in children should target the respiratory as well as GI tract.","Iroh Tam, Pui-Ying; Chisala, Mphatso; Nyangulu, Wongani; Thole, Herbert; Nyirenda, James",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8357119/,150
20080,Disgusting odours affect the characteristics of the Adaptive Force in contrast to neutral and pleasant odours,2021-08-12,"BAX is a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family, which regulates the balance between cellular life and death. During homeostasis, BAX predominantly resides in the cytosol as a latent monomer but, in response to stress, transforms into an oligomeric protein that permeabilizes the mitochondria, leading to apoptosis. Because renegade BAX activation poses a grave risk to the cell, the architecture of BAX must ensure monomeric stability yet enable conformational change upon stress signaling. The specific structural features that afford both stability and dynamic flexibility remain ill-defined and represent a critical control point of BAX regulation. We identify a nexus of interactions involving four residues of the BAX core α5 helix that are individually essential to maintaining the structure and latency of monomeric BAX and are collectively required for dimeric assembly. The dual yet distinct roles of these residues reveals the intricacy of BAX conformational regulation and opportunities for therapeutic modulation.","Bloch, Noah B.; Wales, Thomas E.; Prew, Michelle S.; Levy, Hannah R.; Engen, John R.; Walensky, Loren D.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8363748/,150

The World Health Organisation/International Society of Urological Pathology (WHO/ISUP) grading system for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is prognostically important in clear cell RCC (CCRCC) and papillary RCC (PRCC), and is included in risk stratification scores for CCRCC, thus impacting on patient management. To date there are no systematic studies examining the concordance of WHO/ISUP grading between digital pathology (DP) and glass slide (GS) images. We present a validation study examining intraobserver agreement in WHO/ISUP grade of CCRCC and PRCC. METHODS: Fifty CCRCCs and 10 PRCCs were graded (WHO/ISUP system) by three specialist uropathologists on three separate occasions (DP once then two GS assessments; GS1 and GS2) separated by wash-out periods of at least two-weeks. The grade was recorded for each assessment, and compared using Cohen’s and Fleiss’s kappa. RESULTS: There was 65 to 78% concordance of WHO/ISUP grading on DP and GS1. Furthermore, for the individual pathologists, the comparative kappa scores for DP versus GS1, and GS1 versus GS2, were 0.70 and 0.70, 0.57 and 0.73, and 0.71 and 0.74, and with no apparent tendency to upgrade or downgrade on DP versus GS. The interobserver kappa agreement was less, at 0.58 on DP and 0.45 on GS. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the assessment of WHO/ISUP grade on DP is noninferior to that on GS. There is an apparent slight improvement in agreement between pathologists on RCC grade when assessed on DP, which may warrant further study.","Browning, Lisa; Colling, Richard; Verrill, Clare",Diagn Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8380382/,150

However, there remains uncertainty about the optimal oxygen titration target in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: Prospectively identified adult patients meeting the Berlin definition of ARDS between 1st January 2014 and 13th December 2016 were analyzed. Oxygen exposure variables were collected at 6-hourly intervals. The primary exposure was the average time-weighted partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO(2)) calculated over a maximum of 7 days from meeting ARDS criteria. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the impact of exposure variables on clinical outcomes. Results are presented as odds ratio [95% confidence interval]. RESULTS: 202 patients were included in the final analysis. Overall ICU mortality was 31%. The average time-weighted PaO(2) during the first 7 days of ARDS was similar between non-survivors and survivors (11.3 kPa [10.2, 12.5] (84.8 mmHg [76.5, 93.8]) vs. 11.9 kPa [10.9, 12.6] (89.3 mmHg [81.8, 94.5]); p = 0.08). In univariable and multivariable analysis, average time-weighted PaO(2) demonstrated a U-shaped relationship with ICU mortality. There was a similar relationship identified with hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ARDS, the predicted probability of both ICU and hospital mortality was lowest when the average time-weighted PaO(2) was between 12.5 and 14 kPa (93.8–105.0 mmHg), suggesting this is a reasonable oxygenation target for clinicians to aim for.

However, it remains unclear how T cell receptor (TCR) characteristics contribute to heterogeneity in Tscm and other memory T cells. We compared the TCR-beta (TRB) repertoire characteristics of CD4+ Tscm with those of naïve and other CD4+ memory (Tm) in 16 human subjects. Compared with Tm, Tscm had an increased diversity across all stretches of TRB repertoire structure, a skewed gene usage, and a shorter length distribution of CDR3 region. These distinctions between Tscm and Tm were enlarged in top1000 abundant clonotypes. Furthermore, top1000 clonotypes in Tscm were more public than those in Tm and grouped in more clusters, implying more epitope types recognized by top1000 clonotypes in Tscm. Importantly, self-reactive clonotypes were public and enriched in Tscm rather than Tm, of type one diabetes patients. Therefore, this study highlights the unique features of Tscm different from those of other memory subsets and provides clues to understand the physiological and pathological functions of Tscm.","Wang, Shiyu; Wang, Longlong; Liu, Yang; Zhu, Yonggang; Liu, Ya",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8401816/,150

Sixty-one parents (56 mothers, five fathers) from four sites (California, Illinois, Texas, and Puerto Rico) each participated in a single one-hour focus group session, which included an average of five parents. The findings of this study indicated that parents perceived themselves and their families to be physically active, while some parents believed their children were getting enough physical activity at school and afterschool programs. Walking, bicycling, and playing soccer were the most common physical activities that parents reported engaging in as a family. In addition, some parents shared their preference for exercising without their children. Time constraints along with unsafe neighborhood streets and parks were identified as the major barriers to being physically active as a family. Mothers reported that fathers’ involvement in physical activity and combining a healthy diet with exercise were useful strategies for physical activity promotion.

In this study, we propose an artificial neural network (ANN)-based estimation model to predict HRPF levels of the general public using simple affordable physical information. The model is designed to use seven inputs of personal physical information, including age, gender, height, weight, percent body fat, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI), to estimate levels of muscle strength, flexibility, maximum rate of oxygen consumption (VO(2max)), and muscular endurance. HRPF data (197,719 sets) gathered from the National Fitness Award dataset are used for training (70%) and validation (30%) of the model. In-depth analysis of the model’s estimation accuracy is conducted to derive optimal estimation accuracy. This included input/output correlation, hidden layer structures, data standardization, and outlier removals. The performance of the model is evaluated by comparing the estimation accuracy with that of a multiple linear regression (MLR) model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieved up to 10.06% and 30.53% improvement in terms of R(2) and SEE, respectively, compared to the MLR model and provides reliable estimation of HRPF levels acceptable to smart fitness applications.","Lee, Seung-Hun; Ju, Hyeon-Seong; Lee, Sang-Hun; Kim, Sung-Woo; Park, Hun-Young; Kang, Seung-Wan; Song, Young-Eun; Lim, Kiwon; Jung, Hoeryong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8507740/,150

Liposomal carriers can be applied by invasive (e.g. i.m., s.c., i.d.) as well as non-invasive (transdermal and mucosal) routes. In the last 15 years, liposome vaccine technology has matured and several vaccines containing liposome-based adjuvants have been approved for human and veterinary use or have reached late stages of clinical evaluation. Given the intensifying interest in liposome-based vaccines, it is important to understand precisely how liposomes interact with the immune system and how they stimulate immunity. It has become clear that the physicochemical properties of liposomal vaccines – method of antigen attachment, lipid composition, bilayer fluidity, particle charge, and other properties – exert strong effects on the resulting immune response. In this chapter we will discuss some aspects of liposomal vaccines including the effect of novel and emerging immunomodulator incorporation. The application of metallochelating nanoliposomes for development of recombinant vaccine against Lyme disease will be presented as a suitable example.","Turánek, Jaroslav; Mašek, Josef; Křupka, Michal; Raška, Milan",Molecular Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120364/,150

Despite immune responses to these viruses, many bats remain infected without disease and likely shed virus to other bats and mammals. Little is known about bat immune systems or how the immune responses of bats control infections. The recent characterization of genome and transcriptome sequences of several bat species suggests they are similar to other mammals. These data indicate that bats possess orthologous genes, antibodies, and cells involved in innate and adaptive immune responses as do other mammals, but bats likely evolved unique mechanisms for controlling viruses that cause disease in other species. It is unclear how these diseases affect bat ecology, and thus, a greater understanding of immunology and infection is needed to understand health impact on bats.","Schountz, Tony","Bat Evolution, Ecology, and Conservation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121822/,150

It is indeed an irony that the reticuloendothelial system (RES), the body’s major defence system, is the primary site for intracellular infections which are more difficult to treat. Pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages play an important role in defence. However, ingenious pathogen survival mechanisms including phagolysosome destruction enable their persistence. Microbial biofilms present additional challenges. Low intracellular drug concentrations, drug efflux by efflux pumps and/or enzymatic degradation, emergence of multi-drug resistance (MDR), are serious limitations of conventional therapy. Targeted delivery using nanocarriers, and passive and active targeting strategies could provide quantum increase in intracellular drug concentration. Receptor mediated endocytosis using appropriate ligands is a viable approach. Liposomes and polymeric/lipidic nanoparticles, dendrimers micelles and micro/nanoemulsions could all be relied upon. Specialised targeting approaches are demonstrated for important diseases like tuberculosis, HIV and Malaria. Application of targeted delivery in the treatment of veterinary infections is exemplified and future possibilities indicated.

These microbial relations range from intraspecific to interspecific interactions, and from simple short-term interactions to intricate long-term ones. They have played a key role in the formation of plant and animal kingdoms, often resulting in coevolution; they control the size, activity level, and diversity patterns of microbial communities. Therefore, they modulate trophic networks and biogeochemical cycles, regulate ecosystem productivity, and determine the ecology and health of plant and animal partners.

Initially discovered with features of rubor, tumor, calor, and dolor, scientific investigations have revealed chemical components, cells, and pathways involved in the process of inflammation. The body’s initial defense in response to infection, trauma, or inflammation is through the acute-phase response (APR). APR is a multifaceted set of systemic reactions seen shortly after the experience of a triggering event. One of the many aspects of an APR is the increased hepatic synthesis of positive acute-phase proteins (APPs) leading to increased serum concentration of these proteins. The serum level of these APPs returns to base concentration when the stimulating factor is not anymore present. Today a plethora of inflammatory diseases are causing concern to global health. All the key players and mediators of inflammation change its role with the change in setup of disease and patients. The biomarkers of inflammation and inflammatory mediators are also used as therapeutic targets in under-trial animal models. Even in clinical diagnosis of an inflammatory patient, some broad-spectrum markers were analyzed without individual dissection of each mediator or biomarker. This chapter also provides a review of the acute-phase protein C-reactive protein and its possible use as inflammatory biomarker in diseases. We have highlighted case studies of some patients from Kolkata, India, revealing inflammation from disease together with their clinical history. The question which we probe in here is that whether there is a correlation with the clinical history, C-reactive protein, and inflammation and whether CRP can act as a unique diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in some diseases. The future course of this chapter lies in identifying clinical markers for inflammation, the sequential flow of inflammatory responses for a wide spectrum of diseases and its diagnostic, and therapeutic application to screen out pro-inflammatory diseases vs. anti-inflammatory conditions.","Ansar, Waliza; Ghosh, Shyamasree",Biology of C Reactive Protein in Health and Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122703/,150
25978,Immunorecognition of Biological Agents: An Introduction to Immunology,2017-07-06,"As the Ebola outbreak continued to rage in West Africa, Western countries began to be directly affected by the disease. On the last day of September 2014, the first active Ebola case was diagnosed in the United States. Officials in Dallas, Texas, scrambled to contain the virus. A few weeks later, tension rose dramatically when two of the nurses who treated the initial US patient developed Ebola. One of the nurses traveled to Ohio and back before becoming sick. She flew by plane and had contact with other travelers. Officials were very worried that Ebola flare-ups would start to occur across the country. On October 6, 2014, a nursing assistant in Spain was diagnosed with Ebola. Like the US nurses, she had helped treat a repatriated Ebola victim. On October 23, 2014, a new US case was identified. A doctor was diagnosed with Ebola in New York City after returning from Guinea. On the same day, an Ebola case was discovered in the West African country of Mali. The Ebola outbreak seemed out of control and poised to start a major international epidemic. In West Africa, however, a corner had been turned. Healthcare efforts had shifted from treating all Ebola patients in medical facilities to providing families with supplies to take care of sick patients at home. Toward the end of October 2014, reports started to surface about there being fewer cases in West Africa, especially in Liberia. These reports were initially treated with caution. As time progressed, however, it became clear that the drop in cases was real.","Bullard, Stephan Gregory",A Day-by-Day Chronicle of the 2013-2016 Ebola Outbreak,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122725/,150

At one extreme was the arrest and lifetime confinement in Hawaii and elsewhere of sufferers from leprosy, or Hansen’s disease. This, of course, was not an example of presidential policy, but is included as an example of horrible overreach. An opposite approach was the refusal of the Eisenhower administration to mount a vaccination program to deal with the Asian flu pandemic of 1957. President Eisenhower was devoted to private solutions to such emergencies, and these were manifestly inadequate. There was yet another extreme example of a misguided approach, and that was President Woodrow Wilson’s militant passivity to the 1918 influenza pandemic. Disregarding advice from medical consultants, he refused to discontinue the shipment of troops abroad to fight in the Great War, which resulted in an even greater spread of the contagion because of the great numbers of men confined to small quarters aboard ships. Incompetence can always be a danger in public health emergencies. Although this was not a pandemic, the George W. Bush administration handled the health crisis caused by Hurricane Katrina so poorly that it became a national scandal. On the other hand, President Bush did move to plan wisely for a possible influenza pandemic when he ordered the creation of national stockpiles of antiviral medication.","Skidmore, Max J.","Presidents, Pandemics, and Politics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123304/,150

It is assembled around arrays of ribosomal DNA genes, forming specific chromosomal features known as nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) which are the sites of ribosomal DNA transcription. While the nucleolus main activity involve different steps of ribosome biogenesis, the presence of proteins with no obvious relationship with ribosome subunit production suggests additional functions for the nucleolus, such as regulation of mitosis, cell cycle progression, stress response and biogenesis of multiple ribonucleoprotein complexes. The many novel factors and separate classes of proteins identified within the nucleolus support this view that the nucleolus may perform additional functions beyond its known role in ribosome subunit biogenesis. Here we review our knowledge of the nucleolar functions and will provide a detailed picture of how the nucleolus is involved in many cellular pathways.","Dubois, Marie-Line; Boisvert, François-Michel",The Functional Nucleus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123373/,150

30144,Principles of the Design of Enzyme Immunoassays,2012-12-02,"OBJECTIVE: To provide cutting‐edge information for the management of community‐acquired pneumonia in children under 5 years, based on the latest evidence published in the literature. DATA SOURCE: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, by using the expressions: “community‐acquired pneumonia” AND “child” AND “etiology” OR “diagnosis” OR “severity” OR “antibiotic”. All articles retrieved had the title and the abstract read, when the papers reporting the latest evidence on each subject were identified and downloaded for complete reading. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the era of largely implemented bacterial conjugate vaccines and widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques, respiratory viruses have been identified as the most frequent causative agents of community‐acquired pneumonia in patients under 5 years. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation ≤ 96%) and increased work of breathing are signs most associated with community‐acquired pneumonia. Wheezing detected on physical examination independently predicts viral infection and the negative predictive value (95% confidence interval) of normal chest X‐ray and serum procalcitonin < 0.25 ng/dL was 92% (77‐98%) and 93% (90‐99%), respectively. Inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation < 90% are predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. Moderate/large pleural effusions and multilobar infiltrates are predictors of severe disease. Orally administered amoxicillin is the first line outpatient treatment, while ampicillin, aqueous penicillin G, or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options to treat inpatients.

It is estimated that the prevalence of wheezing during the first five years of life varies from 30–60%. In the majority of children who experience wheezing with respiratory infections, these episodes of wheezing become less frequent as the child grows older. However, determining whether the initial episode of wheezing with a viral respiratory illness is an important factor in the eventual development of asthma is an important question. Although a significant body of information suggests an association between respiratory tract illnesses in early life and the later development of airway dysfunction, this relationship is difficult to establish and indicates the complexity of factors that surround the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eventual expression of asthma. A similarly important issue to resolve is the relationship between respiratory infections and the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness. It is apparent that viral, not bacterial, upper respiratory infections (URIs) trigger asthma attacks. With the use of more sensitive techniques to identify respiratory viruses, the relationship between respiratory infections, particularly viral URIs, and asthma has become even more convincing and important.","Busse, William W.; Dick, Elliot C.; Lemanske, Robert F.; Gern, James E.",Asthma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155587/,150

Data Sources – Data were examined from the human and veterinary literature identified through Pubmed and references listed in appropriate articles pertaining to apoptosis. Human Data Synthesis – The role of apoptosis in health and disease is a rapidly growing area of research in human medicine. Apoptosis has been identified as a component of human autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and sepsis. Veterinary Data Synthesis – Research data available from the veterinary literature pertaining to apoptosis and its role in diseases of small animal species is still in its infancy. The majority of veterinary studies focus on oncologic therapy. Most of the basic science and human clinical research studies use human blood and tissue samples and murine models. The results from these studies may be applicable to small animal species. Conclusions – Apoptosis is the complex physiologic process of programmed cell death. The pathophysiology of apoptosis and disease is only now being closely evaluated in human medicine. Knowledge of the physiologic mechanisms by which tissues regulate their size and composition is leading researchers to investigate the role of apoptosis in human diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disease and sepsis. Because it is a multifaceted process, apoptosis is difficult to target or manipulate therapeutically. Future studies may reveal methods to regulate or manipulate apoptosis and improve patient outcome.","O'Brien, Mauria A.; Kirby, Rebecca",J Vet Emerg Crit Care (San Antonio),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169302/,150
31388,Gastric Carcinoma,2016-04-07,"Eight virus families whose members infect vertebrates are currently known to possess single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes: the families Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae and Hepeviridae have non-enveloped capsids, whereas the families Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae are characterized by enveloped capsids. They all have in common the property of using their own genome as messenger RNA (mRNA), from which they synthesize one or several polyproteins that are subsequently cleaved into individual proteins by viral or cellular proteases. These viruses possess the genetic information for the synthesis of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This enzyme transcribes the positive RNA strand as well as the complementary negative RNA strands, which arise as intermediate products of genome replication. In the course of this process, the new genomic RNA molecules are generated from the second transcription step. The classification into the different taxonomic families depends on the number, size, position and orientation of viral genes in the RNA molecule, the number of different polyproteins that are synthesized during viral infection and the existence of an envelope as a virion component.","Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Schätzl, Hermann",Molecular Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169642/,150

Studies with bacteriophages in their prokaryotic host cells in the 1940s and 1950s provided the first insights into the complexities of viral replication. With the development of mammalian cell culture procedures, the techniques used for the study of bacteriophages were adapted to animal viruses. Progress has been such that the basic mechanisms of transcription, translation, and nucleic acid replication have been characterized for all the major families of animal viruses and the strategy of gene expression and its regulation clarified. Many important biochemical phenomena such as the splicing and other types of posttranscriptional processing of RNA, the posttranslational cleavage and glycosylation of proteins, the replication of RNA, reverse transcription, integration, and the transposition of viral genes and cellular oncogenes were first elucidated by virologists and have general application in cell biology. The chapter provides a general overview on viral replication for understanding pathogenesis, immunity, chemotherapy, and the role of viruses in cancer.","FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

The patterns displayed by these species are diverse, and different explanations are applicable to different patterns. Regional variation in SE Fennoscandian bog and extremely poor fen vegetation is described, based on all available published material. Carpets, lawns, and hummocks are considered separately. Four regional vegetational gradients are identified: (1) W‐E, (2) S‐N, (3) SW‐NE, and (4) NW‐SE. These are related to different underlying climatic gradients: (1) humidity (precipitation surplus), (2) temperature, (3) and (4) combinations of humidity and temperature. Effects of climatic gradients on the ground water regime are outlined. The decisive factor for the SW‐NE gradient is probably frequency of ground water table fluctuations, the NW‐SE gradient is likely to be caused by differences in water supply and ground water flow rates. The main gradient of carpets is S‐N (SE‐NW), of lawns SW‐NE (W‐E), and of hummocks partly SW‐NE, partly S‐N. The effects of the underlying ecological factors on the different plant groups are discussed in order to explain the patterns of regional variation in vegetation.","Økland, Rune H.",Nord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7192334/,150

The rapid adoption and continuous technological evolution of molecular diagnostics have often strained the development and maintenance of a functional underlying framework of coding, coverage, and reimbursement policies, thereby presenting challenges to various stakeholders including molecular professionals, payers, and patients. A multidisciplinary working group convened by the Association for Molecular Pathology Economic Affairs Committee was tasked to describe the complex landscape of molecular pathology economics and highlight opportunities for member engagement. In this manuscript, on the basis of review and synthesis of government regulations and procedures, published payer policy documents, peer-reviewed literature, and expert consensus, the Working Group navigates the ecosystem of molecular pathology economics in terms of stakeholders, coding systems and processes, coverage policy determination, and pricing mechanisms. The composition and interrelatedness of various working groups and committees are emphasized in order to highlight the functional underpinnings of the system. Molecular professionals must be conversant in the language and complex inner workings of molecular pathology economics in order to lead successful, viable laboratories and advocate effectively for policy development on their behalf.

36157,Preference Refinement After a Budget Contraction,2020-06-29,"Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) make use of rich and complex data about students and their learning activities to assist educators in understanding and making informed decisions about student learning and the design and improvement of learning processes. With the increase in the volume, velocity, variety and veracity of data on students, manual navigation and sense-making of such multi-dimensional data have become challenging. This paper proposes an analytical approach to assist LAD users with navigating the large set of possible drill-down actions to identify insights about learning behaviours of the sub-cohorts. A distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that it takes a process mining lens to examine and compare students’ learning behaviours. The process oriented approach considers the flow and frequency of the sequences of performed learning activities, which is increasingly recognised as essential for understanding and optimising learning. We present results from an application of our approach in an existing LAD using a course with 875 students, with high demographic and educational diversity. We demonstrate the insights the approach enables, exploring how the learning behaviour of an identified sub-cohort differs from the remaining students and how the derived insights can be used by instructors.","Shabaninejad, Shiva; Khosravi, Hassan; Leemans, Sander J.

It combines the continued fraction method and Coppersmith’s method to factor N in polynomial time. The second attack shows that given [Formula: see text] for [Formula: see text] and a fixed X, we can simultaneously factor the k RSA moduli. It manipulates the result from diophantine approximation to enable the conditions of Coppersmith’s method.

36403,"Editorial Overview: Electrochemical Engineering If chemists make chemicals and chemical engineers make money, what do electrochemical engineers do?",2020-07-09,"Recommendation algorithms based on collaborative filtering show products which people might like and play an important role in personalized service. Nevertheless, the most of them just adopt explicit information feedback and achieve low recommendation accuracy. In recent years, deep learning methods utilize non-linear network framework to receive feature representation of massive data, which can obtain implicit information feedback. Therefore, many algorithms are designed based on deep learning to improve recommendation effects. Even so, the results are unsatisfactory. The reason is that they never consider explicit information feedback. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Granular Algorithm for Rating Recommendation (HGAR), which is based on granulation computing. The core idea is to explore the multi-granularity of interaction information for both explicit and implicit feedback to predict the users ratings. Thus, we used Singular Value Decomposition model to get explicit information and implicit information can be received by multi-layer perception of deep learning. In addition, we fused the two part information when the two models are jointly trained. Therefore, HGAR can explore the multi-granularity of interaction information which learned explicit interaction information and mined implicit information in different information granular level. Experiment results show that HGAR significantly improved recommendation accuracy compared with different recommendation models including collaborative filtering and deep learning methods.","Qian, Fulan; Huang, Yafan; Li, Jianhong; Zhao, Shu; Chen, Jie; Wang, Xiangyang; Zhang, Yanping",Rough Sets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338198/,150

This was a randomised, non-blinded clinical trial conducted in a neonatal intensive care unit. The inclusion criteria were newborns with a gestational age of ≤ 32 weeks and RDS. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to two groups: the ultrasound group, administered surfactant based on LUS score and/or FiO(2) threshold, and the control group, guided by FiO(2) only. Fifty-six patients were included. The ultrasound group received surfactant earlier (1 h of life vs. 6 h, p < 0.001), with lower FiO(2) (25% vs. 30%, p = 0.016) and lower CO(2) (48 vs. 54, p = 0.011). After surfactant treatment, newborns in the ultrasound group presented a greater SpO(2) (p = 0.001) and SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (p = 0.012). Conclusions: LUS score allowed an earlier surfactant therapy, reduced oxygen exposure early in life and a better oxygenation after the treatment.

By taking a critical perspective on Agile frameworks and Agile organizational settings the authors are familiar with, we contribute an initial problematization of paradoxes for the Agile context. For instance, Agile teams face the continuous paradox of ‘doing Agile’ (= following an established Agile way of working) versus ‘being Agile’ (= changing an established Agile way of working). One of the paradoxes that organizations face is whether to start their Agile journey with a directed top-down (and therefore quite un-Agile) ‘big bang’ or to allow an emergent bottom-up transformation (which may be more in-line with the Agile spirit but perhaps not be able to overcome organizational inertia). Future research can draw on our initial problematization as a foundation for subsequent in-depth investigations of these Agile paradoxes.

By comparing the data recorded by the influenza SS in 2019-20 season to those collected for the previous years, we want to evaluate whether the implementation of ILI SS could succeed in early detection and monitoring of Covid-19 diffusion. We analyzed the data recorded by the influenza SS and we compared the distribution of ILI incidence rate by week for 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 season in order to understand whether the SS detected any abnormality coinciding with Covid-19 outbreak. The distribution of ILI cases in the three seasons presented a similar pattern up to the 9th week; after then, a reduction in the ILI incidence rate was observed in the 2017-18 and the 2018-19 season while an increase was detected for 2019-20. During 2019-20 season, three major characteristics stand out: i) at the beginning of Covid-19 epidemic (7th-9th week) 9,17/1000 cases were reported; ii) during the recognition of the COVID-19 outbreak (9th-10th week) 6,36/1000 cases; iii) during the spread of Covid-19 (10th-11th week) an unexpected increase to 7,72/1000 cases. Additionally, their geographical distribution was concentrated in the areas known to be most affected by the epidemic. The influenza SS enabled us to detect the introduction and distribution of COVID-19. Implementation of the system should be prioritized in order to early identify new waves of Covid-19 but also any future novel respiratory pathogen. In order to empower the SS, it would be advisable to increase the population coverage about 2% which is the actual standard.

40759,Chemical 24/7,2020-10-14,"OBJECTIVES: Previous research indicates that mindfulness meditation reduces anxiety and depression and enhances well-being. We examined the impact of app-delivered mindfulness meditation on resting state functional MRI (fMRI) connectivity among physician assistant (PA) students and surgery residents. METHODS: PA students and residents were randomized to receive a popular meditation app or to wait-list control group. Before and after the 8-week meditation period, we acquired fMRI scans of participants’ resting state, and participants completed a self-report measure of mindfulness. We used a 2 × 2, within- and between-group factorial design and leveraged a whole-brain connectome approach to examine changes in within- and between-network connectivity across the entire brain, and to examine whether changes in connectivity were associated with app use or to changes in self-reported mindfulness. RESULTS: Meditation practitioners exhibited significantly stronger connectivity between the frontoparietal network and the left and right nucleus accumbens and between the default mode (DMN) and salience networks, among other regions. Mindfulness practice time was correlated with increased connectivity between the lateral parietal cortex and the supramarginal gyrus, which were also positively correlated with increased scores on the “Describing” subscale of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire between baseline and post-meditation. These findings are consistent with previous research indicating that mindfulness-based interventions alter functional connectivity within the DMN and between the DMN and other networks both during meditation and at rest, as well as increased connectivity in systems important for emotion and reward. CONCLUSIONS: Recent commentaries call for healthcare provider and trainee wellness programs that are sustainable and preventive in nature rather than reactive; these data indicate that even brief sessions of app-delivered mindfulness practice are associated with functional connectivity changes in a dose-dependent manner.

We used a Japanese nationwide database to investigate the effectiveness of surgical rib fixation in relation to its timing. METHODS: We used the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database to identify patients with rib fractures who underwent mechanical ventilation from 1 July 2010 to 31 March 2018. We performed overlap weight analysis to compare in-hospital outcomes between patients who had and had not undergone surgical rib fixation within 3, 6 or 10 days after admission. The primary outcomes were duration of mechanical ventilation and post-rib fixation length of hospital stay. The secondary outcomes were tracheostomy, post-admission pneumonia and all-cause 28-day in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: We identified 8922 eligible patients. Surgical rib fixation within 3 days after admission was associated with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (percent difference, − 42.9%; 95% confidence interval, − 57.4 to − 23.3) and shorter hospital stay (percent difference, − 19.6%; 95% confidence interval, − 31.8 to − 5.2). There were no significant differences between the groups in tracheostomy (risk difference, − 0.04; 95% confidence interval, − 0.15 to 0.07), post-admission pneumonia (risk difference, − 0.04; 95% confidence interval, − 0.13 to 0.05) or all-cause 28-day in-hospital mortality (risk difference, − 0.02; 95% confidence interval, − 0.07 to 0.03). However, there were no significant differences in any in-hospital outcomes between those who had and had not undergone rib fixation within 6 or 10 days after admission. CONCLUSION: Early surgical rib fixation was associated with better in-hospital outcomes, whereas later surgical rib fixation was not.

42767,"Deterrence, Resilience, and the Shooting Down of Flight MH17",2014-12-15,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many changes to clinical practice, including the introduction of remote clinics. Those familiar with remote clinics have reported benefits to their use, such as patient satisfaction and cost benefits; however, ongoing challenges exist, including delivering optimal patient-centred care. As a tertiary paediatric surgery unit in the UK, completing remote clinics was a new experience for most of our surgical team. We completed a service evaluation early into the COVID-19 pandemic aiming to define and address issues when delivering remote clinics in paediatric surgery. Remote clinics were observed (telephone and video), with follow-up calls to families following the consultations. RESULTS: Eight paediatric surgeons were observed during their remote clinics (telephone n = 6, video n = 2). Surgeons new to remote clinics felt their consultations took longer and were reluctant to discharge patients. The calls did not always occur at the appointed time, causing some upset by parents. Prescription provision and outpatient investigations led to some uncertainty within the surgical team. Families (n = 11) were called following their child’s appointment to determine how our remote clinics could be optimised. The parents all liked remote clinics, either as an intermediate until a face-to-face consultation or for continued care if appropriate. Our findings, combined by discussions with relevant managers and departments, led to the introduction of recommendations for the surgical team. An information sheet was introduced for the families attending remote clinics, which encouraged them to take notes before and during their consultations. CONCLUSIONS: There must be strong support from management and appropriate departments for successful integration of remote clinics. Surgical trainees and their training should be considered when implementing remote clinics. Our learning from the pandemic may support those considering integrating remote clinics in the future.","Charnell, A. M.; Hannon, E.; Burke, D.; Iredale, M. R.; Sutcliffe, J.

42770,Deterrence Rediscovered: NATO and Russia,2014-12-15,"Academic studies and policy documents have elaborated on the 0.1% sulphur cap in roro shipping and its potential impact on vessel operating costs, the competitiveness of roro shipping compared to other transport modes and the risks for triggering a ‘modal back shift’ from sea to road. This study revisits the paper ‘The impact of low sulphur fuel requirements in shipping on the competitiveness of roro shipping in Northern Europe’ published in this journal as reported by Notteboom (WMU J Marit Aff 10(1), 63-95) by applying a cost model to measure route competitiveness in north Europe in October 2018 and May 2020. We find that the use of low sulphur fuel has only a moderate impact on the cost competitiveness of shortsea routes. Only in a few cases do we see the cost balance in modal competition tilting towards the ‘truck only’ option. Compared to the findings by Notteboom (WMU J Marit Aff 10(1), 63-95), the compulsory transition to low sulphur emission solutions so far had far less significant impacts on the cost competitiveness of shortsea-dependent routing options. The smaller differences in cost competitiveness compared to Notteboom (WMU J Marit Aff 10(1), 63-95) are partly explained by smaller observed price gaps between HFO and low sulphur fuels and higher road charge costs for trucking. We further demonstrate that lower vessel utilization degrees can seriously affect the cost competitiveness of routing alternatives involving long and shorter roro sections and increase the risk of a modal back shift from sea to road. Contrary to most earlier studies, the combination of many routes and different periods of observation allows to test the robustness of the outcomes taking into account these spatial and temporal dimensions.","Notteboom, Theo",WMU J Marit Affairs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7701937/,150
42772,Gut Metabolism of Furanocoumarins: Proposed Function of Co O-Methyltransferase,2020-11-17,"Probabilistic Programming offers a concise way to represent stochastic models and perform automated statistical inference. However, many real-world models have discrete or hybrid discrete-continuous distributions, for which existing tools may suffer non-trivial limitations. Inference and parameter estimation can be exceedingly slow for these models because many inference algorithms compute results faster (or exclusively) when the distributions being inferred are continuous. To address this discrepancy, this paper presents Leios. Leios is the first approach for systematically approximating arbitrary probabilistic programs that have discrete, or hybrid discrete-continuous random variables. The approximate programs have all their variables fully continualized. We show that once we have the fully continuous approximate program, we can perform inference and parameter estimation faster by exploiting the existing support that many languages offer for continuous distributions. Furthermore, we show that the estimates obtained when performing inference and parameter estimation on the continuous approximation are still comparably close to both the true parameter values and the estimates obtained when performing inference on the original model.","Laurel, Jacob; Misailovic, Sasa",Programming Languages and Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7702239/,150
43142,Heparin-Modified Amniotic Membrane Combined With Growth Factors for Promoting Corneal Wound Healing After Alkali Burn,2020-11-23,"INTRODUCTION: As of May 04, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 3.5 million people and touched every inhabited continent. Accordingly, it has stressed health systems the world over leading to the cancellation of elective surgical cases and discussions regarding healthcare resource rationing. It is expected that rationing of surgical resources will continue even after the pandemic peak, and may recur with future pandemics, creating a need for a means of triaging emergent and elective spine surgery patients. METHODS: Using a modified Delphi technique, a cohort of 16 fellowship-trained spine surgeons from 10 academic medical centers constructed a scoring system for the triage and prioritization of emergent and elective spine surgeries. Three separate rounds of videoconferencing and written correspondence were used to reach a final scoring system. Sixteen test cases were used to optimize the scoring system so that it could categorize cases as requiring emergent, urgent, high-priority elective, or low-priority elective scheduling. RESULTS: The devised scoring system included 8 independent components: neurological status, underlying spine stability, presentation of a highrisk post-operative complication, patient medical comorbidities, expected hospital course, expected discharge disposition, facility resource limitations, and local disease burden. The resultant calculator was deployed as a freely-available web-based calculator: https://jhuspine3.shinyapps.io/SpineUrgencyCalculator/ CONCLUSION: Here we present the first quantitative urgency scoring system for the triage and prioritizing of spine surgery cases in resource-limited settings. We believe that our scoring system, while not all-encompassing, has potential value as a guide for triaging spine surgical cases during the COVID pandemic and post-COVID period.","Sciubba, Daniel M; Ehresman, Jeffrey S; Pennington, Zach; Lubelski, Daniel; Feghali, James; Bydon, Ali; Chou, Dean; Elder, Benjamin D; Elsamadicy, Aladine A; Goodwin, Matthew; Goodwin, C.

We argue that women are more likely to support absentee ballots because they allow for greater flexibility and minimize the potential for exposure. We test this theory using the National Panel Study of COVID-19 (n = 1,892), which asked respondents about their preferences for absentee ballots, their worry about the coronavirus, and their household composition. Using multinomial logistic regressions, we find that women are more likely to support allowing absentee ballots compared with more restrictive voting options and are more likely to say they support absentee ballots for all if they know someone who has contracted COVID-19.

47057,The Digital Urban Fabric: Affordances of Connectivity and Datafication,2021-02-15,"Amidst the rampancy of COVID-19, the news media and academics have emphasized men’s gendered vulnerability. Many examine the risks individuals or communities are exposed to, implying the need to reconsider gendered stereotypes that victimize people at work and at home. In this short commentary, rather than interrogating the risk-related agenda, I reflect on genders as imagined sources of disease by studying strategies adopted by administrators in health communication for the purpose of disease control. Using AIDS and syphilis as examples, Sander Gilman (Gilman 1988) notes that the construction of various boundaries of disease, of images of the patient as the vessel and transmitter, depends on our moral sense and consequent desire to insulate those we define as ill. COVID-19 exposed people’s speculations about the reservoirs of pathogens. In a post-conflict society, Hong Kong is an ideal looking glass, magnifying the process through which symbols of disease are portrayed. On the one hand, this short essay aims to examine how gendered sources of COVID-19 manifest in a society within a specific geopolitical context. On the other hand, through the new iconography of disease, I identify the challenges of modernity “Asia’s world city” has been experiencing. I explore these questions through an examination of specific aspects of Hong Kong’s response to COVID-19: gendered Sinophobia toward police officers’ wives; reactions to retired women who sought out younger men as dance partners during COVID-19; failure to recognize and protect foreign domestic workers as a vulnerable group during the pandemic; government actions that draw on “toxic masculine” traits and values; the city’s response to queer communities’ involvement in COVID-19 outbreaks; and the government’s deliberate de-emphasis on gender issues as compared with China. Each of these examples encapsulates how both gendered and cross-border conceptions of disease iconography were geopolitically formed regarding the recent tension between Hong Kong and China.","Wu, Harry Yi-Jui",Men Masc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7957333/,150

This study aimed to develop a framework using knowledge management in tackling recurring problems in the Nigerian construction industry. The data instrument was a well-designed questionnaire directed at construction professionals. Out of the 80 questionnaires distributed, the study used 78 (97.5%) questionnaires for analysis. The study identified corruption, inadequate planning measures, and reduced government policies as the main factors influencing recurring project management challenges in the Nigerian construction industry. The study revealed significant knowledge management strategies used by Nigerian construction professionals, which include the use of emails, face-to-face interactions, and brainstorming sessions. The knowledge management strategies are further classified into data mining based, traditional based, and mobile technology-based knowledge management strategies in the construction sector. The primary benefits associated with knowledge management mechanisms in the construction industry include high growth performance, aid decision making, and innovation in the construction sector. Further classification showed that these benefits are mainly performance-based and collaboration and learning-based benefits. The study proposed a knowledge management framework for tackling recurring challenges in the Nigerian construction industry.

In attempting to define the correlates associated with natural protection against HIV, extreme heterogeneity in the datasets generated from systems methodologies can be further complicated by the inherent variability encountered at the population, individual, cellular and molecular levels. Furthermore, such studies have been limited by the paucity of well-characterised samples and linked epidemiological data, including duration of infection and clinical outcomes. To address this, we selected 10 volunteers who rapidly and persistently controlled HIV, and 10 volunteers each, from two control groups who failed to control (based on set point viral loads) from an acute and early HIV prospective cohort from East and Southern Africa. A propensity score matching approach was applied to control for the influence of five factors (age, risk group, virus subtype, gender, and country) known to influence disease progression on causal observations. Fifty-two plasma proteins were assessed at two timepoints in the 1st year of infection. We independently confirmed factors known to influence disease progression such as the B(*)57 HLA Class I allele, and infecting virus Subtype. We demonstrated associations between circulating levels of MIP-1α and IL-17C, and the ability to control infection. IL-17C has not been described previously within the context of HIV control, making it an interesting target for future studies to understand HIV infection and transmission.

Two prophylactic vaccines against HZ are currently licensed for human use, a live attenuated vaccine and a subunit vaccine containing recombinant VZV glycoprotein E (gE) as antigen. The latter has superior protective efficacy against HZ and PHN. During HZ subunit vaccine development, we obtained Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell clones expressing VZV gE. This study was performed to optimize culture media conditions for CHO cell growth and gE production. Using a high-throughput culture system, three CHO cell clones were cultured in microtiter plates containing 24 different basal media, and three basal media were selected. The clone with the highest gE expression was fed-batch cultured in each of the three basal media in combination with 13 different feed media. A pair of media, BalanCD CHO Growth A and EX-CELL Advanced CHO Feed 1, with the highest productivity was selected for gE production. Scale-up fed-batch cultures of the selected clone cultured in a wave bag bioreactor containing the optimized media yielded 2440 mg gE protein/L culture, a 11.5-fold increase compared to original culture conditions (batch culture in CD OptiCHO medium). The optimized media condition is used to produce VZV gE antigen for an HZ subunit vaccine, which is under phase I clinical trial.

Patient satisfaction is a key indicator of whether telephone consultations deliver high-quality care. This study evaluates patient perceptions of telephone consultations conducted in a single plastic surgery outpatient department. METHOD: Structured telephone interviews using an adapted Telehealth Usability Questionnaire and the NHS Friends and Family Test were conducted in 98 patients who had undergone outpatient telephone consultations with a plastic surgeon. 13 questions explored domains of usefulness, interaction quality, reliability, patient satisfaction, and future use of telehealth. RESULTS: 72 of 98 (73%) completed the survey. Male(49):Female(23). Mean age 59 (range 17-91). 50.4% Strongly agreed (SA) and 24.3% agreed (A) to questions addressing usefulness of the platform. For interaction quality; 63% SA and 21% A. 47% disagreed with questions pertaining to reliability. Overall, 75% were either SA/A for satisfaction and 81% would use telehealth again. No significant difference was found in domain scores when comparing sex or age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, patient perceptions were positive towards the usefulness and interaction quality of telephone consultations. However, reliability scored poorly. Most patients were satisfied with the care provided.

METHODS: A Gender-Career/Family Implicit Association Test was developed and distributed to the international plastic surgery community. Mean scores were calculated. Respondents were provided with an automated summary interpretation of their results, categorizing association for a particular grouping of gender and career/family as a little or no, slight, moderate, or strong. Respondents were also asked a series of demographic and post-IAT questions. RESULTS: Ninety-five responses were available for analysis. Overall, respondents showed a moderate-to-strong association of male + career / female + family compared with the reverse, which was statistically significant. Nearly half of the respondents thought they might have an implicit gender-related bias; however, 50% post-test would not change their behavior based on results, while 9.5% would. CONCLUSIONS: Plastics surgeons may have an unconscious tendency to associate men with a career and women with a family. Further steps must be taken to increase awareness and mitigate the impact of implicit gender bias.","Bucknor, Alexandra; Ngaage, Ledibabari M.; Taylor, Kirsten J.; Kamali, Parisa; Rakhorst, Hinne A.; Mathijssen, Irene M.

When the COVID‐19 pandemic struck and many schools shifted from in person to online teaching, we hypothesized that if safety measures were used, in person cadaveric anatomy could be safely taught without a decrease in student performance. To test this, we reduced onsite attendance to less than 25% of room capacity. Masks were required at all times and students were instructed to social distance. Six students were assigned per cadaver, but only two students dissected at a time. The other four students reviewed and completed dissections and/or reviewed in groups of two at other allotted times. Thus, students dissected only every third lab. Dissection and lab review attendance was mandatory and students were nearly 100% compliant. Teaching assistants recorded dissected prosections reviews, and these videos were uploaded to password protected course files for independent learning. Students were provided iPads in the laboratory and access to three software packages for use on and off site. All students had access to multiple formative quizzes and exams, and three new online practice practical exams were created. To help reduce testing anxiety, a pass/fail system replaced categorical grading. However, all written and practical exams were conducted on site and in person. At TTUHSC, we have developed an exam question database to track historical student performance including a 25‐question optional pre‐block practice exam used to assess incoming student anatomical aptitude. In 2020, 90% of incoming students (93% in 2019) took the pre‐block exam and scored an average of 28% (24% in 2019). In 2020, despite vastly different content delivery approaches (>80% of lectures were on Zoom) and reduced in‐person dissection requirements, students modestly outperformed their 2019 counterparts. Overall exam averages were 89% in 2020 compared to 87% in 2019. If a categorical system was in place, 66% of students would have earned Honors or High Pass in 2020 compared to 61% in 2019. Our formative assessments were highly predictive of summative exam performance, and students reported that they reduced exam stress. Furthermore, summative exam averages correlated strongly with NBME performance (p<0.0001, r(2)=0.63). TTUHSC medical students estimated that a majority of their peers at other medical schools did not have any in person dissection in 2020. Our students ranked in person laboratory dissection as the most useful learning activity, 88% reported that our COVID‐19 preparations were very good to outstanding, and 97% were satisfied with the quality of their anatomy education. We conclude that 1) When using appropriate precautions, in person cadaveric anatomy can be taught safely during a pandemic; 2) cadaveric dissection is essential for mastery of anatomical concepts; and 3) coupling online learning modalities with rigorous formative assessments prevented a modest reduction in cadaveric dissection opportunities from negatively impacting student performance.","Davis, Vanessa; Plata, Gabrielle; Gunter, Brady; Rodriguez, Jaremy; Wall, John; Dang, Michael; Gilbert, Kerry; Kaur, Gurvinder; Bishop, Keith; Schneider, Brandt",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239706/,150

We first find that enhanced federal matching funds are roughly the same size as expected increases in state Medicaid costs nationwide over the entirety of the federal budget window. Second, we show that there is substantial variation in states' exposure to increases in Medicaid program costs. Third, we show that the formulas through which fiscal relief has been distributed impact the extent to which aid targets the states experiencing the greatest need. Applications for Practice: –. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, states' Medicaid programs have been both a source of heightened expenditures and a vehicle through which federal aid has flowed. –. Nationwide, we find that enhanced federal Medicaid matching funds are roughly the same size as expected increases in states' Medicaid costs over the entirety of the federal budget window. –. We find that enhanced Medicaid matching funds are not correlated with variations in states' Medicaid enrollment increases and thus do not effectively target the states that have experienced the largest increases in program cost. –. We find that the American Rescue Plan Act's unemployment‐based formula for allocating federal dollars does a moderately better job than the enhanced Medicaid matching funds at targeting resources at states that have experienced the largest increases in Medicaid enrollment.","Clemens, Jeffrey; Ippolito, Benedic; Veuger, Stan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8242625/,150

Default occurs either the first time a signaling process breaches a threshold barrier or unexpectedly at the first jump of a Cox process. The intensity of default depends on the risk-free interest rate, which follows a Vasicek process, instead of a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process as in the original model. This offers two advantages. On the one hand, it allows us to account for negative interest rates which are recently observed, on the other hand, it simplifies the formula for pricing CDSs. The goodness of fit of the model is tested using a dataset of CDS credit spreads related to European companies. The results obtained show a rather satisfactory agreement between theoretical predictions and market data, which is identical to the one obtained with the original model. In addition, the values of the calibrated parameters result to be stable over time and the semi-closed form solution ensures a very fast implementation.","Radi, Davide; Hoang, Vu Phuong; Torri, Gabriele; Dvořáčková, Hana",Decisions Econ Finan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8346788/,150

The incidence of vascular and thrombotic complications with Zoster Sine Herpete has been reported very infrequently in the medical literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented to Emergency Room with right-sided facial weakness and headache. We saw no rash on physical examination. A sub-segmental pulmonary embolus was found on C.T. angiography of the chest. VZV was detected on Lumbar Puncture studies. The patient responded well to anti-viral treatment and was discharged home without any complications. CONCLUSION: The suspicion of thrombo-embolic complications should be high with Zoster Sine Herpete. Screening for coagulopathies and timely initiation of anticoagulation should be carried out in appropriate clinical settings.,"Sahra, Syeda; Jahangir, Abdullah; Gavica, Mishelle Centeno; Mobarakai, Neville; Jahangir, Ahmad",Respir Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8349081/,150

At first, based on the willingness of decision maker to each part of HFNs, a new method has been proposed to compare them. Then, several t-norm and t-conorm-based aggregation operators of HFNs, i.e., algebraic t-norm and t-conorm, Einstein t-norm and t-conorm, Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm, Frank t-norm and t-conorm have been defined, and some of their mathematical properties are also discussed. As the special cases of the above t-norm and t-conorm-based aggregation operators of HFNs, Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm-based HFN weighted averaging operator, Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm-based HFN weighted geometric operator, Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm-based HFN ordered weighted averaging operator, and Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm-based HFN ordered weighted geometric operator have been proposed. The new problem of improving the process of educational activities under the Covid-19 epidemic conditions, for instance, has been defined as a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem, in which students are its options, courses are its criteria, and teachers are members of the decision-making team. Then, the scores of final exams and teachers’ assessments merged together as HFNs, and a new method has been proposed based on the before mentioned operators to solve the resulting MAGDM problem. A numerical example, the results of which are also analyzed, is responsible for explaining what is proposed in this article. Finally, subsequent studies in this area are briefly stated.","Keikha, Abazar",Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8380419/,150

METHODS We searched Ovid Medline (1946 to May 6, 2020), Ovid Embase (1974 to May 6, 2020), EBSCO CINAHL (inception to May 6, 2020), Elsevier Scopus (inception to April 14, 2020), and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses (inception to April 14, 2020). Reports were eligible if they included any obesity management intervention, included 2 to 18 year olds with overweight or obesity (or if the mean age of participants fell within this age range), were in English, included experimental study designs, and had attrition reduction as a main outcome. Two team members screened studies, abstracted data, and appraised study quality. RESULTS Our search yielded 5415 original reports; five met inclusion criteria. In two studies, families attended an orientation session as an attrition-reduction strategy before treatment enrollment; in three others, text messaging and motivational interviewing supplemented existing obesity management interventions. Attrition-reduction strategies led to decreased attrition in two studies, increased in one, and no difference in two. For the two strategies that reduced attrition, (a) pre-treatment orientation and (b) text messaging between children and intervention providers were beneficial. The quality of the five included studies varied (good [n = 3]; poor [n = 2]). CONCLUSION Some evidence suggests that attrition can be reduced. The heterogeneity of approaches applied and small number of studies included highlight the need for well-designed, experimental research to test the efficacy and effectiveness of strategies to reduce attrition in managing paediatric obesity.","Ball, Geoff D C; Sebastianski, Meghan; Wijesundera, Jessica; Keto-Lambert, Diana; Ho, Josephine; Zenlea, Ian; Perez, Arnaldo; Nobles, James; Skelton, Joseph A",Pediatric obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijpo.12733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32959990/,150

Although it is common practice for patients to be transferred between provinces for specialist care, the upsurge in the COVID-19 pandemic has led to some hospitals considering reserving intensive care and critical care beds for COVID-19 patients from their province. The Constitution provides that nobody may be refused emergency medical treatment, nor may they be unfairly discriminated against. This is also implicit in the 'equitable' provision of healthcare services referred to in the National Health Act 61 of 2003. The Critical Care Society of Southern Africa COVID-19 guidelines, or other similar widely accepted guidelines, may be used, provided they do not unfairly discriminate against patients on the basis of age. According to the Constitution, a hospital that wishes to turn away an emergency treatment request from another province because it is reserving beds for COVID-19 patients from its home province will have to show that it is 'reasonable and justifiable' to do so. It will have to show that the other province's patient was being subjected to the same criteria for admission as its home province COVID-19 patients, because, for instance, occupation of the bed by another COVID-19 patient from the home province was imminent.","McQuoid-Mason, D J",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://doi.org/10.7196/samj.2021.v111i4.15554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33944760/,150

To address this gap in knowledge, the ASA Committee on Geriatric Anesthesia and the ASA Perioperative Brain Health Initiative undertook a survey of ASA members to characterize current practices related to perioperative care of older adults. Methods We administered a web-based questionnaire with items assessing the proportion of practice focused on delivery of care to older adults, adherence to recommended practices for older surgical patients, resource needs to improve care, and practice characteristics. Results Responses were collected between May 24, 2018, and June 29, 2018. A total of 25,587 ASA members were invited to participate, and 1737 answered at least one item (6.8%). 96.4% of respondents reported that they had cared for a patient aged 65 or older within the last year. 47.1% of respondents (95% confidence interval, 44.6%, 49.7%) reported using multimodal analgesia among patients aged 65 and older at least 90% of the time, and 25.5% (95% CI, 23.3%, 27.7%) provided preoperative information regarding postoperative cognitive changes at least 90% of the time. Over 80% of respondents reported that preoperative screening for frailty or dementia, postoperative screening for delirium, and preoperative geriatric consultation occurred in fewer than 10% of cases. Development of practice guidelines for geriatric anesthesia care and expansion of web-based resources were most frequently prioritized by respondents as initiatives to improve care in this domain. Discussion Most survey respondents reported providing anesthesia care to older adults, but adherence to recommended practices varied across the six items assessed. Reported rates of screening for common geriatric syndromes, such as frailty, delirium, and dementia, were low among survey respondents. Respondents identified multiple opportunities for ASA initiatives to support efforts to improve care for older surgical patients.","Deiner, Stacie; Fleisher, Lee A; Leung, Jacqueline M; Peden, Carol; Miller, Thomas; Neuman, Mark D",Perioperative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13741-020-0136-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123562/,150

In 2018, the recovery rate of end-of-life passenger vehicles was less than 18% of the scrapped amount. Dynamic material flow analysis can predict the amount of end-of-life passenger cars in China in the future, and analyze the flow of materials in recycling system. Life cycle assessment can be used to quantify greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, this paper integrates these two methods into the model construction of recycling decision system. Meanwhile, sensitivity analysis of the important factors affecting the efficiency of the recovery system is carried out. Finally, the main recovery indexes of the system are predicted under three scenarios: low-speed, medium speed and high-speed development, which are set based on scrap volume, standard recovery rate, proportion of assembly into remanufacturing and carbon tax price. The research results show that in 2018, 656.9 kg/vehicle of iron, 150.2 kg/vehicle of aluminum and 7.9 kg/vehicle of copper are recovered from end-of-life passenger car in China, and the carbon emission during the recovery process is 651.1 kg of CO2eq/vehicle, with a total emission reduction of 3816.1 kgCO2eq/vehicle compared with the original production, and the economic benefit is about 5055.5 yuan/vehicle. The scenario prediction results show that by 2050, from the low-speed development scenario to the high-speed development scenario, the total amount of iron, aluminum and copper recovered rise from 3.96 million tons, 915 thousand tons and 46 thousand tons to 697 thousand tons, 1.61 million tons and 80 thousand tons respectively throughout the year.

This study sought to qualitatively explore the views of health care providers in British Columbia (BC), Canada, on strategies for integrating preventive oral health into prenatal care. METHODS Twenty-four purposefully selected health care providers (13 oral health and 11 prenatal care providers) in Vancouver and Surrey BC participated in audio-recorded semistructured interviews. Interviews lasted from 31 to 61 min, were transcribed verbatim, and were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis with N-Vivo software. Study validity was ensured via memoing, fieldnotes, member checking, and external audit. RESULTS Thematic analysis revealed 5 major themes: perception of integrated care, relevance of integrated prenatal oral health, strategies for achieving integrated prenatal oral health, drivers of the integration process, and barriers to integrating oral health during pregnancy. Interprofessional collaboration based on information sharing and communication was identified as a critical factor for integrated care. Oral health checks should be a component of prenatal assessments for achieving integrated prenatal oral health. Participants recommended that prenatal providers should offer oral health education and use screening questions to identify the pregnant woman's oral health needs. The establishment of referral systems was advocated, while dental assessments and oral prophylaxis via the medical services plan were proposed. The inclusion of dental providers in prenatal teams and educating health care providers on interprofessional collaboration were also supported. CONCLUSION Oral health and prenatal providers in BC are positively disposed to adopting integrated preventive prenatal oral health care based on interprofessional collaborative practices. The inclusion of oral health providers in prenatal teams was suggested.

Balloon angioplasty and stent implantation of an occluded epicardial vessel during ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction can cause disruption of the frail thrombus containing lesions associated with suboptimal myocardial reperfusion and microcirculatory obstruction. Distal embolization of atherothrombotic material can be prevented by thrombus aspiration during primary angioplasty. Mechanical aspiration via end-hole large-lumen thrombectomy catheters has been shown to improve Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow and result in a more consistent early resolution of ST-segment elevation in multiple registries. More recently, a more sophisticated quantification of the myocardial damage has been applied using myocardial scintigraphy and magnetic resonance, with no difference between patients treated with thrombectomy and patients treated with conventional therapy. The expectations in terms of lasting mortality benefit raised by the first Dutch single-center randomized trial of thrombectomy versus predilation with plain old balloon angioplasty (Thrombus Aspiration During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction, TAPAS) were not confirmed by a much larger Swedish trial (Thrombus Aspiration ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction, TASTE) showing no outcome changes. Although we are waiting for new trials to clarify these controversial results, thrombectomy is still used in selected patients with high thrombus load or with persistent occlusion of the infarct-related artery after wire passage.

61145,Endoscopic skull base techniques for juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.,2012,"BACKGROUND Intratumoral regulatory T cells (Treg) in colon cancer are a heterogeneous cell population, with potential impact on patient outcome. Generally, a high Treg infiltration has been correlated to a worse patient outcome, but it is still unclear how the composition of different Treg subsets affects patient relapse and survival. In this study, we used mass and flow cytometry to characterize Treg in colon tumors and corresponding unaffected tissue, followed by a correlation to clinical parameters and patient outcome. RESULTS Using mass cytometry, we defined 13 clusters of intestinal Treg, three of which were enriched in the tumors. The two most enriched clusters were defined by their expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 and CD56, respectively. The Treg accumulating in the tumors expressed inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS), OX-40, and CD39, indicating that they were effector Treg (eTreg). Intratumoral CD39+ Treg also had a higher expression of Foxp3, suggesting a higher suppressive activity, and we subsequently used CD39 as a marker for eTreg. Our further studies showed that colon tumors can be divided into two tumor groups, based on the proportion of CD39+ putative eTreg in the tumors. This property was independent of both tumor microsatellite status and tumor stage, which are important factors in predicting cancer disease progression. In a prospective study of forty-four colon cancer patients, we also showed that patients with a high CD39 expression on tumor-infiltrating Treg have a tendency towards a less favorable patient outcome in terms of cumulative cancer-specific survival. CONCLUSIONS This study uncovers novel subsets of tumor-infiltrating Treg in colon cancer, and suggests that CD39 may be a potential therapeutic target in patients with microsatellite stable colon tumors, which are usually refractory to checkpoint blockade therapy.","Szeponik, Louis; Ahlmanner, Filip; Sundström, Patrik; Rodin, William; Gustavsson, Bengt; Bexe Lindskog, Elinor; Wettergren, Yvonne; Quiding-Järbrink, Marianne",BMC immunology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12865-021-00449-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407765/,150

This study reviewed this data to examine trends in FNA case numbers during fellowship training. METHODS A retrospective review of the ACGME Accreditation Data System (ADS) FNA Case Log data was performed for academic years 2006-2019. For 2006-2016, total and average numbers of FNAs performed per academic year were available. After 2016, data also included the number of programs and trainees, national averages, standard deviation, minimum, median, maximum, and percentiles for the number of FNAs performed. RESULTS The number of FNAs documented by cytopathology fellows has gradually increased from 2006 (average 10.9) to 2013 (average 18.6) and dramatically increased in 2014 (average 38.0). Averages have remained greater than 30 FNAs documented per academic year since 2014, with some variation. However, a decline was observed in 2019, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS FNA procedures reported in the ACGME Case Log System indicate vast differences in cytopathology fellowship educational experiences and settings. After logging FNAs becoming an ACGME requirement in 2013, the average number of FNAs has been greater than 30 per year and provides some guidance for programs with respect to the number of FNAs being reported by cytopathology fellows nationally.","Salomao, Diva; Wu, Roseann I; Hatlak, Kate; Khanafshar, Elham; Monaco, Sara E",Journal of the American Society of Cytopathology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasc.2021.06.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34229981/,150

61872,A survey of rodent-borne pathogens carried by wild-caught Norway rats: a potential threat to laboratory rodent colonies.,2008,"Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are one of the most prescribed anti-hypertensive medications. Previous studies showed RAAS inhibitors increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), a cellular receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which provokes a concern that the use of ACEI and ARB in hypertensive individuals might lead to increased mortality and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To further investigate the effects of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 patients, we systematically reviewed relevant studies that met predetermined inclusion criteria in search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, medRxiv and bioRxiv. The search strategy included clinical data published through Oct 12, 2020. Twenty-six studies involving 8104 hypertensive patients in ACEI/ARB treated group and 8203 hypertensive patients in non-ACEI/ARB treated group were analyzed. Random-effects meta-analysis showed ACEI/ARB treatment was significantly associated with a lower risk of mortality in hypertensive COVID-19 patients (OR=0.624, 95% CI=0.457 to 0.852, p=0.003, I2 =74.3%). Meta-regression analysis showed that age, gender, study site, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale scores, co-morbidities of diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, or cancer has no significant modulating effect of ACEI/ARB treatment on the mortality of hypertensive COVID-19 patients (all p-values>0.1). In addition, the ACEI/ARB treatment was associated with a lower risk of ventilatory support (OR=0.682, 95% CI=0.475 to 1.978, p=0.037, I2 =0.0%). In conclusion, these results suggest that ACEI/ARB medications should not be discontinued for hypertensive patients in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. This article is protected by copyright.

61951,Keeping an eye on the human-animal interface.,2021-02-18,"BACKGROUND New evidence from retrospective cohort studies on risk of death from COVID-19 infection became available. We aimed to systematically review the clinical risk factors for fatal outcome of COVID-19. METHODS We performed meta-analysis, using PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from December 1 2019 to June 10 2020. The meta-analysis summarized clinical, laboratory, radiological features, and complications of non-survivors with confirmed COVID-19. In addition, a fixed- or random-effects model was adopted based on the heterogeneity among studies. We also used funnel-plot with Egger's tests to screen potential publication bias. RESULTS In total, twenty studies with 15,408 COVID-19 cases were included in our meta-analysis. Male, current smoking, and older age were associated with in-hospital death. Patients aged 60 years or over had the highest pooled ORs [OR 4.94 (2.89, 8.44)]. Non-survivors were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory disease, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Respiratory disease had the highest pooled ORs [OR 2.55 (2.14, 3.05)]. Dyspnea [OR 3.31 (1.78, 6.16); I2 : 83%] and fatigue [OR 1.36 (1.07, 1.73); I2 : 0%] were associated with increased risk of death. Increased white blood cell count, decreased lymphocyte and platelet counts, were also associated with increased risk of death. Biomarkers of coagulation function, inflammation, liver and kidney function, cardiac and muscle injury were also elevated in nonsurvivors. CONCLUSIONS Male, current smoking patients aged 60 years or over might face a greater risk of in-hospital death and the comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, CVD, respiratory disease, and CKD could also influence the prognosis of the COVID-19. Clinical feature such as dyspnea and fatigue could imply the exacerbation and even death.

62074,Alarming surge in drug-resistant HIV uncovered.,2019-07-30,"OBJECTIVE Complete sellar floor reconstruction is critical to avoid postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage during transsphenoidal surgery. Recently, the pedicled nasoseptal flap has undergone many modifications and eventually proved to be valuable and efficient. However, using these nasoseptal flaps in all patients who undergo transsphenoidal surgery, including those who had none or only minor CSF leakage, appears to be overly invasive and time-consuming. METHODS Patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal tumor surgery within a 5 year-period were reviewed. Since 2009, we classified the intraoperative CSF leakage into grades from 0 to 3. Sellar floor reconstruction was tailored to each leak grade. We did not use any tissue grafts such as abdominal fat and did not include any procedures of CSF diversions such as lumbar drainage. RESULTS Among 200 cases in 188 patients (147 pituitary adenoma and 41 other pathologies), intraoperative CSF leakage was observed in 27.4% of 197 cases : 14.7% Grade 1, 4.6% Grade 2a, 3.0% Grade 2b, and 5.1% Grade 3. Postoperative CSF leakage was observed in none of the cases. Septal bone buttress was used for Grade 1 to 3 leakages instead of any other foreign materials. Pedicled nasoseptal flap was used for Grades 2b and 3 leakages. Unused septal bones and nasoseptal flaps were repositioned. CONCLUSION Modified classification of intraoperative CSF leaks and tailored repair technique in a multilayered fashion using an en-bloc harvested septal bone and vascularized nasoseptal flaps is an effective and reliable method for the prevention of postoperative CSF leaks.","Park, Jae-Hyun; Choi, Jai Ho; Kim, Young-Il; Kim, Sung Won; Hong, Yong-Kil",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,https://doi.org/10.3340/jkns.2015.58.1.36; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26279811/,150

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic upended the traditional paradigm of face-to-face provision of healthcare in the Australian context; as such, a telehealth model of active case management was implemented in our public health system, even though there was little supporting data for the safety of delivering patient care remotely to home-isolation patients in the setting of a highly infectious and potentially fatal illness. METHODS A retrospective, single-centre, observational cohort study was performed over 6 weeks commencing 12 March 2020, including patients with coronavirus disease 2019 undergoing home isolation and being actively monitored by a coronavirus disease 2019 telephone assessment clinic. Outcomes assessed comprised: duration of active case follow-up, average number of telephone calls per patient, average number of hours managing each patient, treatment required including presentation to the emergency department or admission to hospital, patient characteristics and utilisation of other health services. RESULTS Of 5223 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 tests performed, 170 individuals (3.25%) tested positive. A total of 158 were included: 76 (47.5%) male and median age 31 years (range 18-94). Median symptom duration was 13 days (interquartile range 6, range 2-34). Median length of coronavirus disease 2019 telephone assessment clinic admission was 10 days (interquartile range 7, range 3-32). A total of 1151 telephone patient encounters were undertaken, with a median of six phone calls made to each patient (interquartile range 5, range 1-20). Ten patients required repeat clinic review; all but one returned home. Six presented to emergency department, with three of these being admitted. In total, there were six admissions: one from the clinic, three from the emergency department and two direct from home (bypassing emergency department). Only four of the six admissions (or 2.5% of all patients) required low-flow oxygen therapy; none required high-flow oxygen or assisted ventilation. The remaining 140 patients (88.6%) were safely managed at home without complications. DISCUSSION A telehealth model of care is safe, efficient and cost-effective for the management of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease-19 and facilitates home isolation, especially of a low-risk population, thus providing reassurance that this model is sound and suitable for ongoing use.","Micallef, Milton; Hurley, Siobhan; Brell, Nadiya; Cook, Rebekah; Post, Jeffrey; Overton, Kristen",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x211024097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152869/,150
62422,New fee structure proposed by FDA might lead to more talk.,2011,"BACKGROUND Percutaneous transtracheal ventilation (PTV) via a jet ventilator (PTJV) is considered a rescue technique in difficult airway management. However, whether a conventional ventilator can generate adequate ventilation via PTV is not known. Our goal was to evaluate the tidal volume (V(T)) generated by a conventional ventilator during simulated PTV compared with PTJV in a lung model. METHODS A lung model simulating an adult lung was used. A catheter was inserted through the artificial trachea and connected to either a jet ventilator or a conventional ventilator. The direction of catheter insertion was perpendicular to the trachea, pointing towards the lung and away from the lung. The jet ventilator was operated at 344.7 kPa. The conventional ventilator was operated in the pressure mode at peak inspiratory pressures of 40-90 cm H(2)O. RESULTS The jet ventilator generated larger V(T) [817 (336) ml] when the catheter was pointing towards the lung than when pointing away from the lung or perpendicular to the trachea [121 (41) and 69 (24) ml, respectively, P<0.01]. With the conventional ventilator, changes in V(T) at different direction of catheter insertion were much less [222 (81) ml catheter pointing towards the lung, 229 (121) ml perpendicular to the trachea, and 187 (97) ml away from the lung]. CONCLUSIONS Our result demonstrated that PTJV was effective only when the catheter was pointing towards the lung and requires high operating pressure. A conventional ventilator can generate reasonable minute ventilation through the transtracheal catheter less dependent on directions of catheter insertion and should be considered during emergent PTV.","Liu, Y H; Wang, A L; Marchese, A D; Kacmarek, R M; Jiang, Y",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aes417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23171722/,150

OBJECTIVE To report results after treatment of aneurysms with PED with coils (PED+coils group) or without (PED-only group) at a single-institution. METHODS In this case-controlled study, records of patients who underwent PED treatment between 2011 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients were treated with PED+coils and 75 with PED-only. No statistically significant between-group differences were found in terms of age, sex, aneurysm location, medical comorbidities, and length of follow-up. Aneurysms treated by PED+coils were larger (16.3 mm vs 12.4 mm, P=.02) and more likely to be ruptured (20.7% vs 1.3%, P=.001) or dissecting (34.5% vs 9.3%, P=.002). PED deployment was successful in all cases. At the latest follow-up (mean, 7.8 months), complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved in a higher proportion of the PED+coils group (93.1% vs 74.7%, P=.03). Device foreshortening/migration occurred in 4 patients in the PED-only group and none in the PED+coils group. Fewer patients required retreatment in the PED+coils group (3.4% vs 16.0%, P=.71). Rates of neurological complications (10.3% PED+coils vs 8.0% PED-only, P=.7) and favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score=0-2; 93.1% PED+coils vs 94.7% PED-only, P=.6) were similar. CONCLUSION PED+coils may be a safe and effective treatment for aneurysms with high risk of rupture (or rerupture) and complex anatomy. Coiling in conjunction with PED placement provided a higher aneurysm occlusion rate and reduced the need for retreatment.","Lin, Ning; Brouillard, Adam M; Krishna, Chandan; Mokin, Maxim; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Sonig, Ashish; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25255261/,150
62997,Coronaviruses in animals and humans.,2020-02-19,"OBJECTIVES Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major public health emergency. It poses a grave threat to human life and health. The purpose of the study is to investigate the chest CT findings and progression of the disease observed in COVID-19 patients. METHODS Forty-nine confirmed cases of adult COVID-19 patients with common type, severe and critically severe type were included in this retrospective single-center study. The thin-section chest CT features and progress of the disease were evaluated. The clinical and chest imaging findings of COVID-19 patients with different severity types were compared. The CT severity score and MuLBSTA score (a prediction of mortality risk) were calculated in those patients. RESULTS Among the 49 patients, 35 patients (71%) were common type and 14 patients (28%) were severe and critically severe type. Nearly all patients (98%) had pure ground-glass opacities (GGO) in CT imaging. Of the severe and critically severe type patients, 86% exhibited GGO with consolidation, in comparison with 54% of the patients with common type. Fibrosis presented in 79% of the severe and critically severe type patients and 43% of the common type patients. The severe and critically severe type patients were significantly more prone to experience five-lobe involvement compared to the common type patients (p = 0.002). The severe and critically severe type patients also had higher CT severity and MuLBSTA scores than the common type patients (5.43 ± 2.38 vs 3.37 ± 2.40, p < 0.001;and 10.21 ± 3.83 vs 4.63 ± 3.43, p < 0.001, respectively). MuLBSTA score was positively correlated with admittance to the intensive care unit (p = 0.005, r = 0.351). Nineteen patients underwent three times CT scan. The interval between first and second CT scan was 4[4,8] days, second and third was 3[2,4] days. There were greater improvements in the third CT follow-up findings compared to the second (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS The severe and critically severe type patients often experienced more severe lung lesions, including GGO with consolidation. The CT severity score and MuLBSTA score may be helpful for the assessment of COVID-19 severity and progression. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Chest CT has the value of evaluated radiographical features of COVID-19 and allow for dynamic observation of the disease progression. Considering coagulation disorder of COVID-19, MuLBSTA score may need to be updated to increase new understanding of COVID-19.","Xie, Linjun; Hou, Keke; Xu, Huayan; Fu, Hang; Xu, Rong; Liu, Hui; Zhou, Zhongqin; Li, Zhenlin; Yang, Ming; Guo, Yingkun",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20200219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186052/,150

Exploiting a triple-differences methodology, we find that in Italy Covid-19 hit relatively harder in peripheral areas: the excess mortality in peripheral areas was almost double that of central ones in March 2020 (1.2 additional deaths every 1000 inhabitants). We leverage a rich dataset on Italian municipalities to explore mechanisms behind this gradient. We first show that socio-demographic and economic features at municipal level are highly collinear, making it hard to identify single-variable causal relationships. Using Principal Components Analysis we model excess mortality and show that areas with higher excess mortality have lower income, lower education, larger households, lower trade and higher industrial employments, and older population. Our findings highlight a strong centre-periphery gradient in the harshness of Covid-19, which we believe is also highly relevant from a policy-making standpoint.","Armillei, Francesco; Filippucci, Francesco; Fletcher, Thomas",Economics and human biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2021.101018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34098432/,150

Delirium is associated with substantial negative outcomes, including increased hospital complications and long-term effects on cognition and health status in ICU survivors. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to test the effectiveness of a Family Automated Voice Reorientation (FAVoR) intervention on delirium among critically ill MV patients. The FAVoR intervention uses scripted audio messages, which are recorded by the patient's family and played at hourly intervals during daytime hours. This ongoing orientation to the ICU environment through recorded messages in a voice familiar to the patient may enable the patient to more accurately interpret the environment and thus reduce risk of delirium. The study's primary aim is to test the effect of the FAVoR intervention on delirium in critically ill MV adults in the ICU. The secondary aims are to explore: (1) if the effect of FAVoR on delirium is mediated by sleep, (2) if selected biobehavioral factors moderate the effects of FAVoR on delirium, and (3) the effects of FAVoR on short-term and long-term outcomes, including cognition and health status. Subjects (n = 178) are randomly assigned to the intervention or control group within 48 h of initial ICU admission and intubation. The intervention group receives FAVoR over a 5-day period, while the control group receives usual care.

Patient communication strategies such as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) and voice restorative devices are recommended to facilitate communication. These strategies, however, are inconsistently adopted in ICU practice signaling utilization barriers. Our objective is to map and synthesize the current evidence-base for stakeholder-reported barriers and facilitators to patient communication strategy utilization for adults with an advanced airway in the ICU. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will use Arskey and O'Malley's recommended methods to conduct a scoping review using a rapid review framework to streamline the process. A single reviewer will conduct a search and an initial screen of titles and abstracts from five electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], and PsychInfo) from 1990 to present to identify English language peer-reviewed studies. Subsequently, two reviewers will independently screen a shorter list of studies for inclusion. We will also search the reference lists of eligible studies. Two reviewers will independently extract study characteristics, communication strategy, and stakeholder reported barriers and facilitators. We will code and categorize the extracted barriers and facilitators according to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), an integrative framework of behavior change. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this will be the first scoping review to map and synthesize reported barriers and facilitators to communication strategy utilization in the adult ICU using a theoretical framework. The results of this scoping review will help to identify trends and gaps in the current evidence-base and support recommendations for improving patient-centered practice, policy, and research related to successfully establishing ICU patient communication.","Istanboulian, Laura; Rose, Louise; Yunusova, Yana; Gorospe, Franklin; Dale, Craig",Systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-019-1232-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31810494/,150

METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data regarding 94 patients who underwent surgery in a single surgical unit. Tailoring of the biliopancreatic limb length decided upon preoperative BMI was applied. Patients' excess weight loss and resolution of comorbidities were evaluated. Data on patients' nutritional status is also presented. RESULTS Mean BMI reduction at 36 months postoperatively was 21.7 ± 6.3 kg/m2. Mean excess weight loss (%EWL) was 83.6%, 91.8%, and 92.5% at 12, 24, and 36 months postoperatively, respectively. When controlling for preoperative BMI, a 36-month %EWL of 89.1% for the 2-m subgroup, a 95.3% for the 2.5-m subgroup, and a 104.7% for the 3-m subgroup were found. Operation's success, defined as %EWL greater than 50%, was 97.9% 36 months postoperatively. All patients suffering from hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia achieved full remission. Furthermore, the percentage of patients with obstructive sleep apnea and gastroesophageal reflux disease, achieving full remission was 91.7% and 86.7%, respectively. An incidence of 5.3% new onset regurgitation was noted. Iron deficiency presented in 26 (27.7%) patients postoperatively, vitamin B12 deficiency in 13 (13.8%), folic acid deficiency in 18 (19.1%), and mild hypoalbuminemia in 7 (7.4%). Major early postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ 3) were reported in 1.7% of our patients. One (1.1%) patient developed marginal ulcer and two (2.2) patients had late dumping.

However, prolonged duration of endotracheal tube placement contributes to the development of ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAPs). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether subglottic suctioning using TaperGuard EVAC tubes was effective in decreasing the frequency of VAP. METHODS A total of 276 mechanically ventilated patients for more than 72 hours were randomly assigned to group E (EVAC tube) and group C (conventional tube). All patients received routine care including VAP prevention measures during their intensive care unit stay. In group E, subglottic suctioning was performed every 6 hours. Outcome variables included incidence VAP, intensive care unit length of stay, and mortality. RESULTS Frequency of intraluminal suction, mechanical ventilation-free days, reintubation, the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen and mortality rate were similar between the 2 groups (P > .05). The mean cuff pressure in group E was significantly less than that in group C (P < .001). Ventilator-associated pneumonia was significantly less in group E compared with group C (P = .015). CONCLUSION The use of intermittent subglottic secretion suctioning was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of the VAP in critically ill patients.

A total of 476 health care workers including doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff participated from Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka. A validated WHO Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used to screen for Depression. A 25.7% prevalence of depression was reported among health care workers.

However, there are limited data on efficacy and associated adverse events. Objective To describe the association between use of hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, and clinical outcomes among hospital inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients from a random sample of all admitted patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in 25 hospitals, representing 88.2% of patients with COVID-19 in the New York metropolitan region. Eligible patients were admitted for at least 24 hours between March 15 and 28, 2020. Medications, preexisting conditions, clinical measures on admission, outcomes, and adverse events were abstracted from medical records. The date of final follow-up was April 24, 2020. Exposures Receipt of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, or neither. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiac arrest and abnormal electrocardiogram findings (arrhythmia or QT prolongation). Results Among 1438 hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (858 [59.7%] male, median age, 63 years), those receiving hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both were more likely than those not receiving either drug to have diabetes, respiratory rate >22/min, abnormal chest imaging findings, O2 saturation lower than 90%, and aspartate aminotransferase greater than 40 U/L. Overall in-hospital mortality was 20.3% (95% CI, 18.2%-22.4%). The probability of death for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin was 189/735 (25.7% [95% CI, 22.3%-28.9%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 54/271 (19.9% [95% CI, 15.2%-24.7%]), azithromycin alone, 21/211 (10.0% [95% CI, 5.9%-14.0%]), and neither drug, 28/221 (12.7% [95% CI, 8.3%-17.1%]). In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, compared with patients receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.76-2.40]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.63-1.85]), or azithromycin alone (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.26-1.21]). In logistic models, compared with patients receiving neither drug cardiac arrest was significantly more likely in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (adjusted OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.12-4.05]), but not hydroxychloroquine alone (adjusted OR, 1.91 [95% CI, 0.96-3.81]) or azithromycin alone (adjusted OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.27-1.56]), . In adjusted logistic regression models, there were no significant differences in the relative likelihood of abnormal electrocardiogram findings. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York with COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality. However, the interpretation of these findings may be limited by the observational design.","Rosenberg, Eli S; Dufort, Elizabeth M; Udo, Tomoko; Wilberschied, Larissa A; Kumar, Jessica; Tesoriero, James; Weinberg, Patti; Kirkwood, James; Muse, Alison; DeHovitz, Jack; Blog, Debra S; Hutton, Brad; Holtgrave, David R; Zucker, Howard A",JAMA,https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.8630; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392282/,150

The etiology of the disease is multifactorial, and a large variety of viral agents have been implicated. Here we describe the detection and isolation of an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) -like coronavirus from the intestines of a flock of 60,000 14-day-old brown/red broiler chicks. The birds showed typical clinical signs of RSS including stunting and uneven growth. At necropsy, the small intestines were pale and distended with watery contents. Histopathology of the intestines revealed increased cellularity of the lamina propria, blunting of villi, and cystic changes in the crypts. Negative stain electron microscopy of the intestinal contents revealed coronavirus particles. Transmission electron microscopy of the intestine confirmed coronavirus in the cytoplasm of enterocytes. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), IBV antigen was detected in the intestinal epithelial cells as well as in the proventriculus and pancreas. There were no lesions in the respiratory system, and no IBV antigen was detected in trachea, lung, air sac, conjunctiva, and cecal tonsils. A coronavirus was isolated from the intestine of chicken embryos but not from the allantoic sac inoculated with the intestinal contents of the broiler chicks. Sequencing of the S1 gene showed nucleic acid sequence identities of 93.8% to the corresponding region of IBV California 99 and of 85.7% to IBV Arkansas. Nucleic acid sequence identities to other IBV genotypes were lower. The histopathologic lesions in the intestines were reproduced after experimental infection of specific-pathogen-free chickens inoculated in the conjunctiva and nares. Five days after infection, six of nine investigated birds showed enteritis associated with IBV antigen as detected by IHC. In contrast to the field infection, birds in the experimental group showed clear respiratory signs and lesions in the upper respiratory tract. The results suggest a broader tissue tropism of this isolate, which might be related to the mutations in the S1 gene.","Hauck, Rüdiger; Gallardo, Rodrigo A; Woolcock, Peter R; Shivaprasad, H L",Avian diseases,https://doi.org/10.1637/11353-122215-case; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27309300/,150
65551,"ACE2, the viral gateway.",2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND WEB treatment is an endovascular approach for wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms that has demonstrated high safety and good efficacy in mid-term follow-up. While evaluating safety in the long term is important to determine if delayed adverse events occur affecting late morbidity and mortality, the most important point to evaluate is the long-term stability of aneurysm occlusion. The current analysis reports the 3-year clinical and anatomical results of WEB treatment in the combined population of two European trials (WEBCAST (WEB Clinical Assessment of Intrasaccular Aneurysm Therapy) and WEBCAST-2). METHODS Aneurysm occlusion was evaluated using a 3-grade scale: complete occlusion, neck remnant, and aneurysm remnant. RESULTS The safety population comprised 79 patients. The efficacy population comprised 61 aneurysms. Aneurysm locations were middle cerebral artery in 32/61 aneurysms (52.5%), anterior communicating artery in 13/61 (21.3%), basilar artery in 9/61 (14.8%), and internal carotid artery terminus in 7/61 (11.5%). No adverse events related to the device or procedure occurred between 2 and 3 years. At 3 years, complete occlusion was observed in 31/61 (50.8%) aneurysms, neck remnant in 20/61 (32.8%), and aneurysm remnant in 10/61 (16.4%). Between 1 year and 3 years, aneurysm occlusion was improved or stable in 53/61 (86.9%) aneurysms and worsened in 8/61 (13.1%). Worsening was mostly from complete occlusion to neck remnant in 6/61 (9.8%) aneurysms. The retreatment rate at 3 years was 11.4%. CONCLUSIONS This analysis confirms the high safety profile of WEB. Moreover, evidence demonstrates the great stability of aneurysm occlusion with adequate occlusion (complete occlusion or neck remnant) in 83.6% of aneurysms.

The most common allergens-milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, and wheat-account for 90% of serious allergic reactions. A literature review of online databases in CINAHL, PubMed Central, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Google Scholar, Health Resource Center Academic, and archival searching was performed to identify evidenced-based practices for managing food allergies in schools. There is no cure for food allergies. The current management standard is to avoid the allergen, treat a mild reaction with antihistamine and observation, and treat anaphylaxis with an intramuscular injection of epinephrine. Due to COVID-19 social distancing recommendations, food consumption in schools has moved from cafeterias and lunchrooms into classrooms and other spaces. This in turn necessitates strict adherence to hand washing and disinfecting all surfaces that come in contact with food. Managing food allergies in schools requires cooperation among school administrators, nurses, teachers, staff, families, and health care providers. Resources for managing food allergies in schools are presented offering information for parents, school administrators, nurses, teachers, and staff for planning and implementing strategies for preventing and reducing allergic reactions and treating life-threatening food allergy reactions.","Heideman, Katherine; Poronsky, Cathlin Buckingham",Comprehensive child and adolescent nursing,https://doi.org/10.1080/24694193.2021.1883771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33792445/,150

METHODS Open-access data and press releases on COVID-19 in Taiwan were collected on the website of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. All 55 community-acquired cases of COVID-19 confirmed from January 28 to April 12, 2020 in Taiwan were included. Basic demographic characteristics, symptom presentation, infection source, route of identification, and transmission dynamics were analyzed. RESULTS Of the 55 cases, 52.7% were female and 74.5% were between 20-59 years of age. One sixth (16.4%) of community-acquired cases were asymptomatic. More than half (58.2%) of the cases were identified via contact tracing. The median incubation period was 6 days (range 1 to 13 days) and the median serial interval was 4 days (range -3 to 24 days). Twenty-six cases (47.3%) were transmitted from pre-symptomatic cases, eleven cases (20%) from symptomatic cases, and two cases (3.6%) from an asymptomatic case. The contagious period of symptomatic cases was from 7 days before to 15 days after the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSION The high proportion of asymptomatic cases and the transmissibility in the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic periods make control of COVID-19 challenging. Protective measures such as social distancing, wearing face masks, and hand washing are mandatory to prevent community transmission.","Liu, Jui-Yao; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796323/,150

Here, we assess the feasibility of commercial-grade deep learning software for the detection of intracranial aneurysms on whole-brain anteroposterior and lateral 2D digital subtraction angiography images. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seven hundred and six digital subtraction angiography images were included from a cohort of 240 patients (157 female, mean age 59 years, range 20-92; 83 male, mean age 55 years, range 19-83). Three hundred and thirty-five (47%) single frame anteroposterior and lateral images of a digital subtraction angiography series of 187 aneurysms (41 ruptured, 146 unruptured; average size 7±5.3 mm, range 1-5 mm; total 372 depicted aneurysms) and 371 (53%) aneurysm-negative study images were retrospectively analysed regarding the presence of intracranial aneurysms. The 2D data was split into testing and training sets in a ratio of 4:1 with 3D rotational digital subtraction angiography as gold standard. Supervised deep learning was performed using commercial-grade machine learning software (Cognex, ViDi Suite 2.0). Monte Carlo cross validation was performed. RESULTS Intracranial aneurysms were detected with a sensitivity of 79%, a specificity of 79%, a precision of 0.75, a F1 score of 0.77, and a mean area-under-the-curve of 0.76 (range 0.68-0.86) after Monte Carlo cross-validation, run 45 times.

In March 2020, he developed a fever of 38.9°C and computed tomography revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities. Antibiotic therapy was ineffective. Bronchoscopy was performed and bortezomib-induced lung injury was initially suspected. Due to respiratory exacerbation, high-dose steroid therapy was administered, which resulted in a dramatic improvement of the patient's respiratory failure. Thereafter, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction performed on a preserved bronchial lavage sample tested positive, and thus his diagnosis was corrected to COVID-19 pneumonia. It is difficult to discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia from drug-induced lung disease, as both disorders can present similar ground-glass opacities on computed tomography.

These two phenomena have brought about tremendous advances in scientific discovery but have raised two serious concerns. The complexity of modern data analyses raises questions about the reproducibility of the analyses, meaning the ability of independent analysts to recreate the results claimed by the original authors using the original data and analysis techniques. Reproducibility is typically thwarted by a lack of availability of the original data and computer code. A more general concern is the replicability of scientific findings, which concerns the frequency with which scientific claims are confirmed by completely independent investigations. Although reproducibility and replicability are related, they focus on different aspects of scientific progress. In this review, we discuss the origins of reproducible research, characterize the current status of reproducibility in public health research, and connect reproducibility to current concerns about replicability of scientific findings.

DESIGN Retrospective study. SETTING Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science Department of Dermatology and collaborating medical centers. Patients A total of 376 consecutive adult Japanese patients with DM who visited our hospital or collaborating medical centers between 2003 and 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical and laboratory characteristics of adult Japanese patients with DM and DM-specific Abs that include Abs against Mi-2, 155/140, and CADM-140. RESULTS In patients with DM, anti-Mi-2, anti-155/140, and anti-CADM-140 were detected in 9 (2%), 25 (7%), and 43 (11%), respectively. These DM-specific Abs were mutually exclusive and were detected in none of 34 patients with polymyositis, 326 with systemic sclerosis, and 97 with systemic lupus erythematosus. Anti-Mi-2 was associated with classical DM without interstitial lung disease or malignancy, whereas anti-155/140 was associated with malignancy. Patients with anti-CADM-140 frequently had clinically amyopathic DM and rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease. Cumulative survival rates were more favorable in patients with anti-Mi-2 compared with those with anti-155/140 or anti-CADM-140 (P < .01 for both comparisons). Nearly all deaths occurred within 1 year after diagnosis in patients with anti-CADM-140.

Using the reference strain SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020, we evaluated modes of transmission and the ability of prior infection or vaccine-induced immunity to protect against infection in ferrets. Ferrets were semi-permissive to infection with the USA-WA1/2020 isolate. When transmission was assessed via the detection of vRNA at multiple timepoints, direct contact transmission was efficient to 3/3 and 3/4 contact animals in two respective studies, while respiratory droplet transmission was poor to only 1/4 contact animals. To determine if previously infected ferrets were protected against re-infection, ferrets were re-challenged 28 or 56 days post-infection. Following viral challenge, no infectious virus was recovered in nasal wash samples. In addition, levels of vRNA in the nasal wash were several orders of magnitude lower than during primary infection, and vRNA was rapidly cleared. To determine if intramuscular vaccination protected ferrets, ferrets were vaccinated using a prime-boost strategy with the S-protein receptor-binding domain formulated with an oil-in-water adjuvant. Upon viral challenge, none of the mock or vaccinated animals were protected against infection, and there were no significant differences in vRNA or infectious virus titers in the nasal wash. Combined these studies demonstrate that in ferrets direct contact is the predominant mode of transmission of the USA-WA1/2020 isolate and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is maintained for at least 56 days. Our studies also indicate protection of the upper respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 will require vaccine strategies that mimic natural infection or induce site-specific immunity.Importance:The SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain is a CDC reference strain used by multiple research laboratories. Here, we show the predominant mode of transmission of this isolate in ferrets is by direct contact. We further demonstrate ferrets are protected against re-infection for at least 56 days even when levels of neutralizing antibodies are low or undetectable. Last, we show that when ferrets were vaccinated by the intramuscular route to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ferrets remain susceptible to infection of the upper respiratory tract. Collectively, these studies suggest protection of the upper respiratory tract will require vaccine approaches that mimic natural infection.","Patel, Devanshi R; Field, Cassandra J; Septer, Kayla M; Sim, Derek G; Jones, Matthew J; Heinly, Talia A; Vanderford, Thomas H; McGraw, Elizabeth A; Sutton, Troy C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02232-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827954/,150
68253,Antimicrobial aptamers for detection and inhibition of microbial pathogen growth.,2013,"Investigation of communities in extreme environments with unique conditions has the potential to broaden or challenge existing theory as to how biological communities assemble and change through succession. Deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems have strong, parallel gradients of nutrients and environmental stress, and present unusual conditions in early succession, in that both nutrient availability and stressors are high. We analyzed the succession of the invertebrate community at 9°50'N on the East Pacific Rise for 11 years following an eruption in 2006 in order to test successional theories developed in other ecosystems. We focused on functional traits including body size, external protection, provision of habitat (foundation species), and trophic mode to understand how the unique nutritional and stress conditions influence community composition. In contrast to established theory, large, fast-growing, structure-forming organisms colonized rapidly at vents, while small, asexually reproducing organisms were not abundant until later in succession. Species in early succession had high external protection, as expected in the harsh thermal and chemical conditions after the eruption. Changes in traits related to feeding ecology and dispersal potential over succession agreed with expectations from other ecosystems. We also tracked functional diversity metrics over time to see how they compared to species diversity. While species diversity peaked at 8 years post-eruption, functional diversity was continuing to increase at 11 years. Our results indicate that deep-sea hydrothermal vents have distinct successional dynamics due to the high stress and high nutrient conditions in early succession. These findings highlight the importance of extending theory to new systems, and considering function to allow comparison between ecosystems with different species and environmental conditions.","Dykman, Lauren N; Beaulieu, Stace E; Mills, Susan W; Solow, Andrew R; Mullineaux, Lauren S",Ecology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046895/,150

Existing researches suggest that the infectious viruses could be isolated at the end of the incubation period as well as since illness onset, and viral load in upper respiratory tract swabs reached the peak on day 4-6 after illness onset and thereafter began to decline, implying the infectiousness was relatively strong at the end of incubation period and within one week after illness onset.

A hybrid technique (hand-assisted laparoscopic liver mobilization and minilaparotomy for parenchymal dissection) was developed and used in 19 patients. In 2010, an upper midline incision (10 cm) without laparoscopic assistance for LDRH was innovated, and this technique was used in 9 patients. The perioperative factors were compared, and the indications for minimally invasive LDRH were investigated. The operative blood loss was significantly less for the patients undergoing a minimally invasive procedure versus the patients undergoing the standard procedure (212 versus 316 mL, P = 0.001), and the operative times were comparable. The length of the hospital stay was significantly shorter for the minimally invasive technique group (5.9 versus 7.8 days, P < 0.001). The complication rates were 23% and 25% for the standard technique and minimally invasive technique groups, respectively (P = 0.88). Patients undergoing minilaparotomy LDRH had a body mass index (24.0 kg/m(2)) similar to that of the hybrid technique patients (25.8 kg/m(2), P = 0.36), but the graft size was smaller (780 versus 948 mL, P = 0.22). In conclusion, minimally invasive LDRH can be performed without safety being impaired. LDRH with a 10-cm upper midline incision and without laparoscopic assistance may be appropriate for donors with a smaller body mass. Laparoscopic assistance can be added as needed for larger donors. This type of LDRH with a 10-cm incision is innovative and is recommended for experienced centers.","Nagai, Shunji; Brown, Lloyd; Yoshida, Atsushi; Kim, Dean; Kazimi, Marwan; Abouljoud, Marwan S",Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/lt.23488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22685084/,150
69313,MR imaging techniques for pancreas.,2012,"We study the impact of endogenous longevity on optimal tax progressivity and inequality in an overlapping generations model with skill heterogeneity. Higher tax progressivity decreases both the longevity gap and net income inequality, but at the expense of lower average lifetime and income. We find that the welfare-maximizing income tax is less progressive in our model with endogenous longevity than in our model with exogenous longevity. In a highly stylized calibration of the US economy, we show that optimal tax progressivity is less than what prevails under the current US tax system. Our results are robust to the range of empirical labor supply elasticity and the assumptions of missing annuity markets and stochastic health. Our conclusion for the optimal progressivity of the US tax system can be altered by the adoption of a more egalitarian welfare function or by increases in prevailing levels of wage inequality.","Heer, Burkhard; Rohrbacher, Stefan",Journal of health economics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2021.102515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399312/,150

Thailand reported the first COVID-19 case outside of China on 13th January 2020, Africa reported its first case in Egypt on 14th February 2020 and Nigeria reported its index case of COVID-19 on 27th February 2020. Virtually, all countries in the world are affected, with over 5 million cases reported globally. A literature search was conducted using publications from academic databases and websites of relevant organisations. The disease is associated with typical and atypical signs and symptoms, mimicking other common illnesses. Nigeria is now in the phase of widespread community transmission as almost all the states have reported confirmed cases. The pandemic has shown a wide range of case-fatality rate (CFR) globally; this is postulated to be related to the demographics, existing health systems and probably other unidentified factors. There has been a steady increase in the burden caused by the disease in Nigeria with a relatively stable CFR, which is lower than the global CFR. Health systems have responded with the guidelines for prevention, management, and surveillance of the disease, while effort is being put in place to find a vaccine and a specific therapy for the cure of the disease. The pandemic has had a severe effect on health systems globally, including an unintended disruption in the service delivery of other diseases. It has the potential to disrupt the weak health system in Nigeria significantly. As such, a combination of non-pharmaceutical preventive measures that are cost-effective needs to be scaled up to prevent it from further weakening the existing health system.","Akande, Oluwatosin Wuraola; Akande, Tanimola Makanjuola",The Nigerian postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.4103/npmj.npmj_157_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32687112/,150

All treatments were given orally every other day. EMB increased serum urea, creatinine levels; brain dopamine, serotonin, malondialdehyde levels; brain expression levels of caspase 3 and TNF-α. While, it decreased serum total protein, albumin, brain GABA, AChE, GSH-Px, CAT, and SOD levels. Histopathological findings revealed hemorrhage, congestion, severe degeneration, and edema of the brain tissues. NSO reversed the EMB-induced biochemical and histopathological alterations. This NSO effect is mostly due to its antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiapoptotic activities. These findings suggest NSO as a potential protective and therapeutic agent for EMB-induced neurotoxicity.","Madkour, Doaa A; Ahmed, Mohamed M; Orabi, Sahar H; Sayed, Samy M; Korany, Reda M S; Khalifa, Hanem K",Environmental toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1002/tox.23149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33885218/,150

A successful bench to bedside innovation requires trust in the scientific research, open research and clinical facilities, and participation of patients in clinical studies. In addition, stay-at-home orders and the shutdown of elective medical and surgical care and research laboratories diminished opportunities for the informal interactions that are part of the new product development process. The pandemic and how it was managed prolonged the length of time for creation, adoption, and diffusion of new products and services into the market. Furthermore, the loss of hospital revenues from canceled elective care translates into a much smaller market for new technologies. Looking forward, critical success factors for innovation include federal policy that supports science and offers access and insurance coverage for health care, including addressing social determinants of health. Any further shutdowns of research and clinical care will hinder necessary collaborations between scientists, clinicians, and patients. Economic recovery is required to ensure federal and corporate funding for research and development. Trust in science must be restored to ensure support of necessary regulatory review processes and sufficient participation in clinical trials.

70610,Highly sensitive wide-range target fluorescence biosensors of high-emittance metasurfaces.,2021-06-11,"CONTEXT Globally, governments have introduced a variety of public health measures including restrictions and reducing face-to-face contact, to control the spread of COVID-19. This has implications for mental health services in terms of support and treatment for vulnerable groups such as people with pre-existent mental health conditions. However, there is limited evidence of the impact of COVID-19 and its related restrictions on people with pre-existent mental health conditions. OBJECTIVES To identify the impact of COVID-19 and its related restrictions on people with pre-existent mental health conditions. METHODS A scoping review of the literature was employed. Eight electronic databases (PsycINFO, Cochrane, Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Academic Search Complete) were searched and 2566 papers identified. 30 papers met the criteria for this review and findings were summarised under three key review questions. RESULTS COVID-19 and its related restrictions have had a notable effect on people with pre-existent mental health conditions. Public health restrictions have contributed to increased levels of social isolation, loneliness, and reduced opportunities for people to connect with others. Reduced access to health services and treatments has compounded matters for those seeking support. Exacerbation and deterioration of symptoms are commonly reported and can lead to greater susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. IMPLICATIONS The importance of proactive planning, alternative accessible healthcare services and supports for vulnerable and at-risk groups is illuminated. Increased monitoring, early intervention and individually tailored care strategies are advocated. Recommendations revolve around the need for enhanced provision of remote support strategies facilitated using technology enhanced resources.

Research data on COVID-19 are understandably sparse in Africa. Nigeria, like most African countries, is battling a disease she is poorly equipped to fight. METHODS The current available literature on COVID-19 was reviewed in relation to obstetric practice in the Nigerian context, gaps were identified, and recommendations were made to improve the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigerian obstetric practice. RESULTS In and out of hospital, both the obstetrician and the obstetric patient are constantly being put at risk of exposure to the coronavirus because testing and preventive measures are either ineffective or non-existent. CONCLUSION The pandemic has exposed the gross inadequacies in Nigeria's healthcare system and is therefore a wake-up call to the need for a complete overhaul of infrastructure and services. The government will do well to increase the budget allocation for health from the current paltry 4.14% to the recommended 15% of the total budget.","Ijarotimi, Omotade A; Ubom, Akaninyene E; Olofinbiyi, Babatunde A; Kuye-Kuku, Taiwo; Orji, Ernest O; Ikimalo, John I",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32698245/,150
71174,Bringing monogenic disease screening to the clinic.,2020-07-30,"INTRODUCTION Anesthesia machines have evolved over the years to excel in delivering low-flow anesthesia (<1 L Fresh Gas Flow) in a closed-circuit system, with the obvious benefits being decreased costs and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. At apediatric hospital that provides over 25,000 anesthetics a year, a quality improvement project was initiated with the aim of decreasing the amount of sevoflurane used per anesthetic by 20% over the course of a year. METHODS ThreePDSA cycles involving gathering comparative data, departmental education, improvement updates on our huddle board, and intraoperative confirmation rounds were completed. The bottles of sevoflurane used and the total number of anesthetics performed were collected each month. To account for the fluctuation of anesthetic cases per month, a metric of ""Anesthetics Performed per Bottle of Sevoflurane Used"" was created. RESULTS Compared to a prior twelve-month period, the anesthetics performed per bottle of sevoflurane used was higher with a mean increase of 25%.The bottles of sevoflurane used per month was lower with a mean decrease of 20%. The carbon footprint of our sevoflurane use was also decreased and extrapolated over a year, the decrease was equivalent to 70,000 miles driven, over 3,200 gallons of gasoline consumed, or over 31,000pounds of coal burned. CONCLUSION A QI initiative aimed at changing the practice of delivering at least 2L FGF to delivering a low-flow anesthetic has been a successful value-added enhancement to our pediatric anesthesia practice.","Glenski, Todd A; Levine, Laura",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.13994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32786105/,150

Various anticoagulation strategies have been evaluated in hospitalized patients to prevent complications. The impact of chronic anticoagulation before SARS-CoV-2 infection on the risk for subsequent thrombosis has not been systematically studied. METHODS This was a retrospective single-center study. All patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing from March 13, 2020, through May 6, 2020, at the University of Rochester Medical Center were identified. We included all patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 1 month before COVID diagnosis. We documented the rate of thrombotic complications, type of anticoagulation, bleeding complications, and mortality. RESULTS A total of 107 SARS-CoV2-infected patients were chronically anticoagulated before SARS-CoV-2 testing with a median age of 78. Of those, 42 required hospital admission, with 17 requiring intensive care. No patients, inpatient or outpatient, were diagnosed with a new symptomatic thrombotic complication. Three patients had minor bleeding in the hospital. Thirteen (12%) patients died (69% male). CONCLUSION Our uncontrolled findings suggest that chronic anticoagulation at the time of infection may protect against thrombotic complications and decrease disease severity.","Lachant, Daniel J; Lachant, Neil A; Kouides, Peter; Rappaport, Stephen; Prasad, Paritosh; White, R James",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33448631/,150

METHODS Patient data were obtained from medical records from the University Hospital ""Príncipe de Asturias"", Alcalá de Henares, Madrid, Spain and from the University Hospital ""12 de Octubre"", Madrid, Spain. RESULTS The first patient was a 50-year-old man who presented with anosmia, ageusia, right internuclear ophthalmoparesis, right fascicular oculomotor palsy, ataxia, areflexia, albuminocytologic dissociation and positive testing for GD1b-IgG antibodies. Five days before, he had developed a cough, malaise, headache, low back pain, and a fever. The second patient was a 39-year-old man who presented with ageusia, bilateral abducens palsy, areflexia and albuminocytologic dissociation. Three days before, he had developed diarrhea, a low-grade fever, and a poor general condition. The oropharyngeal swab test for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by qualitative real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay was positive in both patients and negative in the cerebrospinal fluid. The first patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and the second, with acetaminophen. Two weeks later, both patients made a complete neurological recovery, except for residual anosmia and ageusia in the first case. CONCLUSIONS Our two cases highlight the rare occurrence of Miller Fisher syndrome and polyneuritis cranialis during the COVID-2 pandemic.

71458,The COVID-19 vaccine development landscape.,2020-04-09,"PURPOSES We sought to verify the efficacy and safety of RFA in spinal OO and osteoblastomas (OB) (Enneking Stage 2, S2). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patients treated in our hospital. Surgical resection was indicated for Enneking Stage 3 OB. RFA indications for spinal OO and OB (S2) were no neurological deficits, complete bone cortex around the lesion on computed tomography (CT), and cerebrospinal fluid between a lesion and the spinal cord/nerve root on magnetic resonance imaging. Abundant cerebrospinal fluid (more than 1.0 mm) between the lesion and nerve root/spinal cord was preferred to prevent neurological damage by heat. Otherwise, surgery was recommended. The minimum follow-up was 24 months. RESULTS Ten patients were treated with CT-guided percutaneous RFA, including three with OB and seven with OO. No patients had neurological deficits or scoliosis. In OO patients, the average visual analog scale (VAS) scores were 7.6/10 (range 6-10) before RFA. In OB cases, the VAS scores were 8, 7, and 9 before RFA. Nine patients had a one-stage biopsy and then RFA, and one patient had a two-stage procedure (biopsy before RFA). The average RFA time for OO was 10 min (range 4-12). In the three OB cases, the RFA time was 12, 12, and 24 min. The time of the whole produce was 98 min (range 65-130 min). All 10 patients were followed-up. The average follow-up time of OO was 46.6 months (range 24-66). Six patients were free of pain, except one who suffered occasional pain with VAS 2/10. The three OB cases were free of pain at 24, 26, and 26 months. CONCLUSION CT-guided percutaneous RFA is a safe and effective treatment for spinal OO and S2 OB, especially in lesions with no neurological deficits and intact cortical bone.

As remote consultations have been employed across specialities, there has been limited analysis of their efficacy. The goal of this study is to objectively assess if telephone medicine is valuable for clinical consultations in elective orthopaedics using a novel scoring tool. METHODS A literature review and survey were performed to determine the objectives of a specialist consultation. Based on the results, a four-component scoring system was developed with a set of guidelines. Eighty telephone consultation letters from a hip and knee clinic were scored by two independent observers. The results were compared and the guidelines were clarified. Clinic letters from previous face to face consultations from the same clinic were scored and compared to telephone medicine letters. The inter-observer reliability was calculated using Cronbach's Alpha. RESULTS The mean score of the telephone consultations was 7.3 as compared to 7.9 (Maximum possible score-8) with face to face consultations. Second opinion referrals scored the least when consulted over the telephone, while follow-up patients both pre-operative and post-operative scored similar to face to face consultations. The inter observer reliability co-efficient was more than 0.8 for every component of the score suggestive of good reliability. CONCLUSIONS This study identifies the areas where telephone medicine can make a valuable contribution to making diagnosis and treating orthopedic patients. We plan to use this to stratify future clinic appointments. The score is a simple, concise and reliable tool whose role may not be limited to orthopaedics but can be extended to other medical fields.","Virani, Siddharth; Eastwood, Selina; Holmes, Natalie; Shaeir, Mohammed; Housden, Philip",The surgeon : journal of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2020.09.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132006/,150

The governments alone cannot prevent the spread of this pandemic without creating a sensitive public opinion and cooperation. Therefore, this study analyzed the knowledge, behavior, and precautionary measures taken by the general public to protect themselves from COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY For this purpose, snowball sampling technique was used to collect data from 401 respondents through an online survey in the Punjab province of Pakistan. A Multivariate Probit Model was used to determine the factors affecting the choice of precautionary measures to avoid COVID-19 infection. RESULTS Majority of the respondents (58.1%) belonged to urban areas in this study. The urban respondents had higher knowledge about Coronavirus disease as compared to rural respondents. Similarly, the hygienic behavior of urban respondents was better than rural respondents. But unavailability of hygienic material (mask and hand sanitizer) was the main problem faced by the general public. Public transportation was considered the most risk-prone place to COVID-19 by the respondents. Majority of the respondents perceived medium to highest risk from COVID-19, and it was found one of the most influential factors affecting the adoption of precautionary measures along with knowledge of this pandemic.

72388,Induction of oxidative stress and cytotoxicity by carbon nanomaterials is dependent on physical properties.,2011,"Background: Endovascular treatment for intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) has been developed. However, the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) presents a particular challenge due to the location and tortuous route, and the outcomes of endovascular treatment in patients with stenosis of the intracranial ICA still have not been reported. This article retrospectively investigated the 30-day and 1-year outcomes of tailored endovascular treatment for patients with severe intracranial ICA stenosis from a single center. Methods: Between June 2014 and December 2017, 96 consecutive patients with severe atherosclerotic stenosis (70-99%) of the intracranial ICA were managed with endovascular treatment in Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Three different kinds of treatments [angioplasty with balloon dilatation alone (BD group), balloon-mounted stent (BMS group), and self-expanding stent (SES group)] were performed according to the characteristics of the lesions. The primary endpoints included any stroke or death within 30 days and ipsilateral ischemic stroke afterwards within 1 year. Secondary endpoints included the revascularization success rate (residual stenosis <30%) and the restenosis rate (stenosis ≥ 50%) within 1 year. Results: The 30-day death rate was 0, and the stroke rate of all patients was 7.3% (7/96). The stroke rate was higher in the BD group (15.8%) and SES group (9.8%) than in the BMS group (0%) (p = 0.047). Thirteen (13.5%) patients suffered at least one onset of ischemic stroke in the ipsilateral ICA territory within 1 year, and there was no significant difference among the three groups (p = 0.165). The overall revascularization success rate was 93.8%, and the revascularization success rate was significantly higher in the SES group (100%) than in the BD group (78.9%) (p = 0.006). The restenosis rate of all patients within 12 months was 20.8%, and there was no significant difference among the three groups. Patients with Mori type C target lesions were more likely to suffer stroke within 30 days (25%) and restenosis within 1 year (31.3%). Conclusions: Both the 30-day and 1-year outcomes of tailored endovascular treatments seemed to be acceptable in the treatment of symptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis of the intracranial ICA. However, this needs to be confirmed by further investigation, preferably in large multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials.","Shen, Shengli; Wang, Yingjin; He, Xudong; Ma, Ning; Gao, Feng; Song, Ligang; Sun, Xuan; Liu, Lian; Miao, Zhongrong; Duan, Hongzhou; Mo, Dapeng",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.668868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113312/,150

This review will provide information on the technology, clinical applications and algorithm to follow when desaturation occurs. AREAS COVERED The review will cover the technology of near infrared spectroscopy, cerebral oximetry and the utilization of cerebral oximetry in each clinical setting. Expert commentary: Cerebral oximetry provides a noninvasive measure of cerebral oxygenation, which when persistently declining, can serve as a warning sign of hemodynamic or metabolic compromise intraoperatively or a predictor of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Although useful, the cerebral oximetry readings must be interpreted in the context of other clinical information. When cerebral desaturation is confirmed, an algorithm should be followed in an attempt to increase oxygen delivery to the brain and/or decrease cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen.","Tsai, Hsin-I; Chung, Peter Chi-Ho; Lee, Chao-Wei; Yu, Huang-Ping",Expert review of medical devices,https://doi.org/10.1080/17434440.2016.1219655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27552801/,150

In this study we report on the triphasic nature of the relationship between plant water potential (ψ) at predawn and midday and describe a method that predicts ψ at stomatal closure and turgor loss exclusively from this water potential (WP) curve. The method is based on a piecewise linear regression model that was developed to predict the boundaries (termed O1 and O2) separating the three phases of the curve and corresponding slope values. The method was tested for three economically important woody species. For all species, midday ψ was much more negative than predawn ψ during phase I (mild drought), reductions in midday ψ were minor while predawn ψ continued to decline during phase II (moderate drought), and midday and predawn ψ reached similar values during phase-III (severe drought). Corresponding measurement of leaf gas exchange indicated that boundary O1 between phase I and II coincided with ψ at stomatal closure. Data from pressure-volume curves demonstrated that boundary O2 between phase II and III predicted ψ at leaf turgor loss. The WP curve method described here is an advanced application of the Scholander-type pressure chamber to categorize plant dehydration under drought into three distinct phases and to predict ψ-thresholds of stomatal closure and turgor loss.","Knipfer, Thorsten; Bambach, Nicolas; Hernandez, M Isabel; Bartlett, Megan K; Sinclair, Gabriela; Duong, Fiona; Kluepfel, Daniel A; McElrone, Andrew J",Plant physiology,https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.20.00500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764130/,150

In Experiment 1, participants' credibility judgments of comments and authors increased with expertise and increased with the number of reputation ratings for supportive ratings and decreased with number of ratings for disconfirmatory ratings. Also, results suggested that the diagnosticity (informativeness) of credibility cues influenced credibility judgments. Using the same credibility cues and task context, Experiment 2 found that when high-utility choices had low credibility, participants often chose alternatives with lower utility but higher credibility. They did this more often when less utility had to be sacrificed and when more credibility was gained. The influence of credibility and utility information on participants' choices was mediated by their explicit credibility judgments. These findings supported the predictions of a Bayesian belief-updating model and an elaboration of Prospect Theory (Budescu, Kuhn, Kramer, & Johnson, 2002). This research provides novel insights into how cues including valence and relevance influence credibility judgments and how utility and credibility trade off during decision making.

In the early stages, they are diagnosed clinically mainly by visual inspection. For a deeper analysis, Doppler ultrasonography is the preferred technique to determine the hemodynamic behaviour of the anomaly. However, this imaging modality is not always available and it requires trained operators for acquiring and interpreting the images. In this sense, there is a lack of portable and user-friendly systems that may help physicians in the assessment of vascular malformations. We propose a new diagnostic procedure, more affordable and easy-to-use, based on a portable thermal camera. This technique provides information about temperature, which has been found correlated with the flow rate of the lesion. In our study, more than 60 vascular malformations of previously diagnosed patients were analysed with a thermal camera to classify them into low- and high-flow ones. The data analysis sensitivity and specificity were 1.","Leñero-Bardallo, J A; Serrano, C; Acha, B; Pérez-Carrasco, J A; Bernabeu-Wittel, J",Clinical and experimental dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ced.14346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32572993/,150

Based on a literature review, it was identified that analyses of phase transformations have been limited to specific heating and cooling rates, which could lead to an incomplete description of the resulting phenomena. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) performed with different heating/cooling rates enabled the precise determination of enthalpy values, which deviate from literature values. Weak and previously unnoticed thermal phenomena at temperatures below 190 K were also observed. Their presence was confirmed by low-temperature in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Through DSC measurements and TEM observations, a model of the discovered phenomenon was proposed, which may have an impact on a better understanding of the physics of magnetic shape memory materials.","Żak, Andrzej; Dańczak, Anna; Dudziński, Włodzimierz","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",https://doi.org/10.1107/s2052520620006794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831275/,150

The spikes, which are composed of three E2 and E1 glycoprotein heterodimers, are responsible for receptor binding and mediating fusion between the viral and host-cell membranes during entry. In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of E2 interacts with the nucleocapsid core during the last stages of particle assembly, possibly to aid in particle stability. During assembly, the spikes are nonfusogenic until the E3 glycoprotein is cleaved from E2 in the trans-Golgi network. Thus, a mutation in E2 potentially has effects on virus entry, spike assembly, or spike maturation. E2 is a highly conserved, cysteine-rich transmembrane glycoprotein. We made single cysteine-to-serine mutations within two distinct regions of the E2 ectodomain in both Sindbis virus and Ross River virus. Each of the E2 Cys mutants produced fewer infectious particles than wild-type virus. Further characterization of the mutant viruses revealed differences in particle morphology, fusion activity, and polyprotein cleavage between Sindbis and Ross River virus mutants, despite the mutations being made at corresponding positions in E2. The nonconserved assembly defects suggest that E2 folding and function is species dependent, possibly due to interactions with a virus-specific chaperone.","Snyder, Anthony J; Sokoloski, Kevin J; Mukhopadhyay, Suchetana",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06615-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22238319/,150

The flavivirus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) plays a role in virus replication and in the elicitation of an immune response. The NS1' protein found among the members of the JEV subgroup is an extended form of NS1 and is generated by a -1 ribosomal frameshift. This protein is known to be involved in viral pathogenicity; however, its specific function is still unknown. Here, we describe an investigation of the molecular function of NS1' protein through the production of JEV NS1'-expressing and -non-expressing clones and their infection of avian and mammalian cells. Efficient NS1' protein expression was observed in avian cells and was found to facilitate JEV production in both avian cultured cells and embryonated chicken eggs. NS1' protein was observed to co-localize with NS5 protein and resulted in increased viral RNA levels in avian cells. These findings clearly indicate that NS1' enhances the production of JEV in avian cells and may facilitate the amplification/maintenance role of birds in the virus transmission cycle in nature.","Takamatsu, Yuki; Okamoto, Kenta; Dinh, Duc Tuan; Yu, Fuxun; Hayasaka, Daisuke; Uchida, Leo; Nabeshima, Takeshi; Buerano, Corazon C; Morita, Kouichi",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.057968-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24443559/,150

However, the molecular mechanisms of antitumor activity and promoting cellular dedifferentiation for reversine have not yet been clearly elucidated. In the present study, it was demonstrated that reversine of 5 μM could induce multinucleated cells through cytokinesis failure rather than just arrested in G2 or M phase. Moreover, reversine reversed the differentiation of sheep fibroblasts into MSC-like style, and notably increased the expression of pluripotent marker genes Oct4 and MSCs-related surface antigens. The fibroblasts treated with reversine could transdifferentiate into all three germ layers cells in vitro. Most importantly, the induced β-like cells and hepatocytes had similar metabolic functions with normal cells in vivo. In addition, reversine promoted fibroblasts autophagy, ROS accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis via the mitochondria mediated intrinsic pathway. The results of high-throughput RNA sequencing showed that most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in Mismatch repair, Nucleotide excision repair and Base excision repair were significantly up-regulated in reversine treated fibroblasts, which means that high concentration of reversine will cause DNA damage and activate the DNA repair mechanism. In summary, reversine can increase the plasticity of sheep fibroblasts and suppress cell growth via the mitochondria mediated intrinsic pathway.","Guo, Yu; Zhu, Huan; Li, Xiangchen; Ma, Caiyun; Sun, Tingting; Wang, Yuanyuan; Wang, Chunjing; Guan, Weijun; Liu, Changqing",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91468-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117304/,150

Medical education has benefitted from a rapid pace of innovation, but due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many paradigms underpinning the medical education of trainees shifted-rendering numerous teaching modalities unusable. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, accelerated the development of novel teaching methodologies, which our trainees are now adapting to. We sought to examine emerging teaching methodologies to understand the opportunities available for medical education to innovate our teaching practices for learners in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS In this narrative review, we drew upon the experiences of the authors as both life-long learners and educators. We then reviewed literature pertaining to novel teaching methodologies developed in medical education since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Several medical specialties have employed novel teaching methodologies including use of telemedicine, remote teaching, online curricula, virtual rotations, virtual conferences, simulations, and learning consortia to continue engaging trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a paucity of literature that addresses efficacy of novel teaching methodologies compared to more traditional teaching methodologies. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity for medical education to combine new and innovative teaching methodologies to create novel, accessible, and engaging learning opportunities for our trainees.","Ho, Patrick A; Girgis, Christina; Rustad, James K; Noordsy, Douglas; Stern, Theodore A",The primary care companion for CNS disorders,https://doi.org/10.4088/pcc.20nr02847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34000143/,150

78752,Advances in local and systemic drug delivery systems for post-surgical cancer treatment.,2020-08-25,"INTRODUCTION The cost associated with single-port laparoscopic access devices may limit utilisation of single-port laparoscopic surgery by colorectal surgeons. This paper describes a simple and cheap access modality that has facilitated the widespread adoption of single-port technology in our practice both as a stand-alone procedure and as a useful adjunct to traditional multiport techniques. METHODS A surgical glove port is constructed by applying a standard glove onto the rim of the wound protector/retractor used during laparoscopic resectional colorectal surgery. To illustrate its usefulness, we present our total experience to date and highlight a selection of patients presenting for a range of elective colorectal surgery procedures. RESULTS The surgical glove port allowed successful completion of 25 single-port laparoscopic procedures (including laparoscopic adhesiolysis, ileo-rectal anastomosis, right hemicolectomy, total colectomy and low anterior resection) and has been used as an adjunct in over 80 additional multiport procedures (including refashioning of a colorectal anastomosis made after specimen extraction during a standard multiport laparoscopic anterior resection). CONCLUSIONS This simple, efficient device can allow use of single-port laparoscopy in a broader spectrum of patients either in isolation or in combination with multiport surgery than may be otherwise possible for economic reasons. By separating issues of cost from utility, the usefulness of the technical advance inherent within single-port laparoscopy for colorectal surgery can be better appreciated. We endorse the creative innovation inherent in this approach as surgical practice continues to evolve for ever greater patient benefit.","Hompes, R; Lindsey, I; Jones, O M; Guy, R; Cunningham, C; Mortensen, N J; Cahill, R A",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-011-0686-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21528438/,150

These cells express fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and contribute to the pathogenesis by producing cytokines, chemokines and proteases. Selective depletion in inflamed joints could therefore constitute a viable treatment option. To this end, we developed and tested a new therapeutic strategy based on the selective destruction of FAP-positive cells by targeted photodynamic therapy (tPDT) using the anti-FAP antibody 28H1 coupled to the photosensitizer IRDye700DX. METHODS After conjugation of IRDye700DX to 28H1, the immunoreactive binding and specificity of the conjugate were determined. Subsequently, tPDT efficiency was established in vitro using a 3T3 cell line stably transfected with FAP. The biodistribution of [111In]In-DTPA-28H1 with and without IRDye700DX was assessed in healthy C57BL/6N mice and in C57BL/6N mice with antigen-induced arthritis. The potential of FAP-tPDT to induce targeted damage was determined ex vivo by treating knee joints from C57BL/6N mice with antigen-induced arthritis 24 h after injection of the conjugate. Finally, the effect of FAP-tPDT on arthritis development was determined in mice with collagen-induced arthritis. RESULTS 28H1-700DX was able to efficiently induce FAP-specific cell death in vitro. Accumulation of the anti-FAP antibody in arthritic knee joints was not affected by conjugation with the photosensitizer. Arthritis development was moderately delayed in mice with collagen-induced arthritis after FAP-tPDT. CONCLUSION Here we demonstrate the feasibility of tPDT to selectively target and kill FAP-positive fibroblasts in vitro and modulate arthritis in vivo using a mouse model of RA. This approach may have therapeutic potential in (refractory) arthritis.","Dorst, Daphne N; Rijpkema, Mark; Boss, Marti; Walgreen, Birgitte; Helsen, Monique M A; Bos, Desirée L; Brom, Maarten; Klein, Christian; Laverman, Peter; van der Kraan, Peter M; Gotthardt, Martin; Koenders, Marije I; Buitinga, Mijke",Rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734285/,150

Previous studies indicated that regulatory T cells (Treg) adoptive transfer might alleviate the hemorrhagic transformation. However, whether Treg in intracranial thrombi correlates with hemorrhagic transformation after mechanical thrombectomy remains unclear. This study mainly analyzed the colocation of Treg markers in serial thrombus sections stained serially for CD4 and CD25 in groups of hemorrhagic or nonhemorrhagic transformation. Second, to investigate whether these immunohistochemical parameters could provide any additional information beyond hemorrhagic transformation, we compared the overlap between Treg markers among other groups, such as functional outcomes, stroke subtypes, and gender. Our results showed that the number of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells was lower in the hemorrhagic transformation thrombi than in the nonhemorrhagic group (p < 0.001) but there were no significant differences otherwise. The present finding of CD4+CD25+ Treg cell reductions in thrombi associated with hemorrhagic transformation provides the histological evidence supporting that thromboinflammation might involve in the pathological process of an acute stroke after mechanical thrombectomy.","Gong, Li; Zheng, Xiaoran; Zhang, Weiyan; Shu, Zhongwen; Wang, Haichao; Dong, Qiong; Sun, Letao; Zhang, Xiang; Zhao, Yanxin; Liu, Xueyuan",Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/3143248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34055193/,150

80263,On the Role of the Pedunculopontine Nucleus and Mesencephalic Reticular Formation in Locomotion in Nonhuman Primates.,2016,"Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been established as a growth factor for the survival and maintenance of dopamine (DA) neurons. In phase I clinical trials, GDNF treatment in Parkinson's disease patients led to improved motor function and GDNF has been found to be down regulated in Parkinson's disease patients. Studies using GDNF heterozygous (Gdnf(+/-)) mice have demonstrated that a partial reduction of GDNF leads to an age-related accelerated decline in nigrostriatal DA system- and motor-function and increased neuro-inflammation and oxidative stress in the substantia nigra (SN). Therefore, the purpose of the current studies was to determine if GDNF replacement restores motor function and functional markers within the nigrostriatal DA system in middle-aged Gdnf(+/-) mice. At 11months of age, male Gdnf(+/-) and wildtype (WT) mice underwent bilateral intra-striatal injections of GDNF (10μg) or vehicle. Locomotor activity was assessed weekly 1-4weeks after treatment. Four weeks after treatment, their brains were processed for analysis of GDNF levels and various DAergic and oxidative stress markers. An intrastriatal injection of GDNF increased motor activity in Gdnf(+/-) mice to levels comparable to WT mice (1week after injection) and this effect was maintained through the 4-week time point. This increase in locomotion was accompanied by a 40% increase in striatal GDNF protein levels and SN GDNF expression in Gdnf(+/-) mice. Additionally, GDNF treatment significantly increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the SN of middle-aged Gdnf(+/-) mice, but not WT mice, which was coupled with reduced oxidative stress in the SN. These studies further support that long-term changes related to the dysfunction of the nigrostriatal pathway are influenced by GDNF expression and add that this dysfunction appears to be responsive to GDNF treatment. Additionally, these studies suggest that long-term GDNF depletion alters the biological and behavioral responses to GDNF treatment.","Littrell, Ofelia M; Granholm, Ann-Charlotte; Gerhardt, Greg A; Boger, Heather A","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbb.2012.12.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23290934/,150
80275,Male Infertility Is Responsible for Nearly Half of the Extinction Observed in the Mouse Collaborative Cross.,2017,"AIMS Sacubitril-valsartan has been shown to have superior effects over angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with heart failure (HF) and hypertension. The efficacy and safety of sacubitril-valsartan in patients with HF are controversial. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess and compare the effect and adverse events of sacubitril-valsartan, valsartan, and enalapril in patients with HF. METHODS AND RESULTS We conducted a systematic search using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomized controlled trials involving the use of sacubitril-valsartan in patients with HF were included. We assessed the pooled odds ratio (OR) of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization for HF in fixed-effects models and the pooled risk ratio (RR) of symptomatic hypotension, worsening renal function, and hyperkalaemia in fixed-effects models. Of the 315 identified records, six studies involving 14 959 patients were eligible for inclusion. Sacubitril-valsartan reduced the endpoints of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in three trials with pooled ORs of 0.83 (P = 0.0006) and 0.78 (P < 0.0001), respectively. Regarding the composite outcome of hospitalization for HF in five trials, the pooled OR was 0.79 (P < 0.00001). Compared with enalapril or valsartan, sacubitril-valsartan was associated with a high risk of symptomatic hypotension (RR 1.47, P < 0.00001), low risk of worsening renal function (RR 0.81, P = 0.005), and low rate of serious hyperkalaemia (≥6.0 mmol/L) (RR 0.76, P = 0.0007) in all six trials. CONCLUSIONS Compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, sacubitril-valsartan significantly decreased the risk of death from all causes or cardiovascular causes in HFrEF and hospitalization for HF in both patients with HFrEF and HF with preserved ejection fraction. Sacubitril-valsartan reduced the risk of renal dysfunction and serious hyperkalaemia but was associated with more symptomatic hypotension.","Zhang, Hongzhou; Huang, Tieqiu; Shen, Wen; Xu, Xiuxiu; Yang, Pingping; Zhu, Dan; Fang, Haiyang; Wan, Hongbing; Wu, Tao; Wu, Yanqing; Wu, Qinghua",ESC heart failure,https://doi.org/10.1002/ehf2.12974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977362/,150
80380,Correction: X-ray pair distribution function analysis and electrical and electrochemical properties of cerium doped Li5La3Nb2O12 garnet solid-state electrolyte.,2020-08-26,"Spirometry test, a measure of the patient's lung function, is the gold standard for diagnosis and monitoring of chronic pulmonary diseases. Spirometry is currently being done in hospital settings by having the patients blow the air out of their lungs forcefully and into the spirometer's tubes under the supervision and constant guidance of clinicians. This test is expensive, cumbersome and not easily applicable to every-day monitoring of these patients. The lung mechanism when performing a cough is very similar to when spirometry test is done. That includes a big inhalation, air compression and forceful exhalation. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that obstruction of lung airways should have a similar effect on both cough features and spirometry measures. This paper explores the estimation of lung obstruction using cough acoustic features. A total number of 3695 coughs were collected from patients from 4 different conditions and 4 different severity categories along with their lung function measures in a clinical setting using a smartphone's microphone and a hospital-grade spirometry lab. After feature-set optimization and model hyperparameter tuning, the lung obstruction was estimated with MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 8% for COPD and 9% for asthma populations. In addition to lung obstruction estimation, we were able to classify patients' disease state with 91% accuracy and patients' severity within each disease state with 95% accuracy.Clinical Relevance- This enables effort-independent estimation of lung function spirometry parameters which could potentially lead to passive monitoring of pulmonary patients.","Nemati, Ebrahim; Rahman, Md Juber; Blackstock, Erin; Nathan, Viswam; Rahman, Md Mahbubur; Vatanparvar, Korosh; Kuang, Jilong",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

80706,Global trends in mangrove forest fragmentation.,2020-04-28,"Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) partly explains geographical differences in COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and mortality. VDD among African-Americans, diabetics, hypertensive, and aged populations possibly explain the higher death rate, aggravated by cocooning. Vitamin D is pleiotropic, mediating bone metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and immune functions, whereas VDD is associated with inflammatory reactions and immune dysfunction, predisposing individuals to severe infections. Vitamin D modulates innate and adaptive immunity via the expression of genes that code antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). And the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)14, the co-receptor for epidermal toll-like receptor (TLR)4. AMPs stimulate TLR2 in macrophages, increasing the conversion of vitamin D into its active form by cytochrome P450 27B1. Antiviral properties of vitamin D-induced AMPs can shift the polarization of the adaptive immune response from helper T cells (Th)1 to the more regulatory Th2 responses that suppress immune over-reactivity by preventing cytokine storm, which is already demonstrated during the Spanish flu episode. Vitamin D induces antiviral effects by both direct and indirect mechanisms via AMPs, immunomodulation, the interplay between major cellular and viral elements, induction of autophagy and apoptosis, variation of genetic and epigenetic factors. The crosstalk between vitamin D and intracellular signaling pathways may operate as a primary regulatory action on viral gene transcription. VDD may increase the likelihood of infection with enveloped viruses, including retrovirus, hepatitis, and dengue. Global data correlates severe VDD with COVID-19 associated coagulopathy, disrupted immune response and mortality, reduced platelet count, and prolonged prothrombin time, suggesting benefits from supplementation. Key teaching points Vitamin D induces antiviral effects by direct and indirect mechanisms via AMPs, immunomodulation, induction of autophagy, etc. Epidemiology of VDD partly explains geographical differences in COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and mortality. Global data correlates severe VDD with COVID-19 associated coagulopathy, disrupted immune response and mortality, reduced platelet count, and prolonged prothrombin time, together suggesting benefits from supplementation. Many clinical trials are underway globally to delineate the role of vitamin D in both prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Vyas, Navya; Kurian, Shilia Jacob; Bagchi, Debasis; Manu, Mohan K; Saravu, Kavitha; Unnikrishnan, Mazhuvancherry Kesavan; Mukhopadhyay, Chiranjay; Rao, Mahadev; Miraj, Sonal Sekhar",Journal of the American College of Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2020.1806758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32870735/,150

MATERIALS AND METHODS In 119 patients with CHD, the level of oxidatively modified low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) in blood plasma and the length of telomeres in nuclear blood cells were determined during the examination. After 5 years, a telephone survey of patients (or their relatives) was conducted to obtain data on the presence of cardiovascular complications. Telomere length was determined using quantitative real-time PCR, and the level of ox-LDL was determined by immunochemical method. RESULTS It was found that reducing the length of telomeres in patients with CHD increases the risk of subsequent development of cardiovascular complications. A strong negative correlation was found between the level of ox-LDL and telomere length in the group of examined CHD patients who had cardiovascular complications after 5 years. CONCLUSION CHD patients with short telomere length and high levels of ox-LDL have an increased risk of cardiovascular complications during 5 years.","Doroshchuk, N A; Lankin, V Z; Tikhaze, A K; Kheimets, G I; Doroshсhuk, A D; Smirnova, M D; Chazova, I E",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,https://doi.org/10.26442/00403660.2021.01.200588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720621/,150

Despite the global frequency of civil unrest, its effect on NGOs' programmatic, administrative, and operational capabilities is poorly understood. To this end, we completed in-depth semi-structured interviews with eight key informants representing seven health NGOs in Nicaragua several months after widespread and persistent civil unrest erupted in April 2018. Data analysis revealed that all NGOs experienced notable disruptions in community education and health promotion, healthcare provision, fundraising, and strategic planning. Further, NGOs experienced several key challenges in responding to crises, including mobility within and between communities, diminishing financial resources, and safety concerns for staff and volunteers. Several NGOs anticipated long-term adverse impacts. In light of these challenges, we propose that health NGOs create a plan of action to mitigate adverse impacts of civil unrest and promote population health. Specifically, a plan of action should address institutional planning, communication strategies, and partnerships and coalitions. We also propose important ways in which future research could build on this preliminary study.","Hartmann, Chris; Hartmann, Jennifer M K; Lopez, Alexis; Flores, Paola",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1789193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633696/,150

METHODS Between 2016 and 2018, 49 patients with postoperative symptoms were treated by laparoscopic surgery at our institute. The data from two preoperative examinations were available for 42 patients. The patients were divided into 4 groups: CT-positive (CP, n = 18), barium follow-through-positive (BP, n = 1), both positive (AP [all positive] n = 13), and both negative (AN [all negative], n = 10). RESULTS Among the 49 patients, 41 received pure laparoscopic surgery, 7 received laparoscopic-assisted surgery with mini-laparotomy, and 1 required conversion. Intra- and postoperative complications occurred in two and seven patients, respectively. Improvement of abdominal symptoms was observed in 40 patients. In terms of the medium-term outcomes, the rate of improvement of symptoms was poorer in the AN group than in the other three groups, but not to a significant degree. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic surgery was safe and feasible for patients with chronic recurrent abdominal symptoms, including SBO. Furthermore, in patients with negative results on both preoperative examinations, laparoscopic surgery may yield only poor improvement of symptoms.","Yahagi, Masashi; Ishii, Yoshiyuki; Ochiai, Hiroki; Sako, Hiroyuki; Maeda, Hinako; Takemura, Yusuke; Oka, Taishu; Soutome, Keiichi; Kamiya, Noriki; Watanabe, Masahiko",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-020-02197-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423108/,150

Anastomosis is evaluated using classical examinations. The most reliable one is endoscopy, which provides direct information on the anastomosis and conduit. But the influence of endoscopy on anastomosis is uncertain. METHODS The internal pressure of a graft during endoscopy was measured in 36 patients who received esophagectomy, by utilizing the decompression tube which was inserted into the graft during operation. We filled the tube with water and measured the maximum water level in a centimeter water column. All examinations were routinely performed on the day after operation, and thin endoscopes were selected for reducing the stress. RESULTS The internal pressure before endoscopy ranged from 6 to 20 cm H2O, and during endoscopy ranged from 9 to 27 cm H2O. The difference in the internal conduit pressure in each patient ranged from 1 to 9 cm H2O. There was no increase in complications caused by endoscopy, including anastomotic leakage. CONCLUSION This study is the first to report changes in internal pressure due to the endoscope by direct measurement. The pressure gradient observed was below the physiological pressure during swallowing. These results suggest that endoscopy is a safe examination even after surgery.","Okada, Takuya; Kawada, Kenro; Nakajima, Yasuaki; Tokairin, Yutaka; Nagai, Kagami; Kawano, Tatsuyuki",Digestive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1159/000351437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23838681/,150

METHODS This cross-sectional survey was carried out between October 2014 and August 2016 in 21 counties throughout Shandong Province. The survey was conducted among patients with leprosy released from treatment (RFT) and their contacts from both household and neighbors. RESULTS A total of 2,210 RFT patients and 9,742 contacts comprising 7877 household contacts (HHCs), including 5,844 genetic related family members (GRFMs) and 2033 non-genetic related family members and 1,865 contacts living in neighboring houses (neighbor contacts, NCs), were recruited. Among identified individuals, one relapsed and 13 were newly diagnosed, giving a detection rate of 0.12%, corresponding to 120 times the passive case detection rate. Detection rates were similar for HHCs and NCs (0.114% vs. 0.214%, P = 0.287).

PURPOSE The study was conducted to assess the level of knowledge and readiness for IPEC among nursing students. METHODS The student's level of knowledge was assessed using a 20 item questionnaire while their readiness for IPEC was measured using the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) comprising 19 items. A total of 125 nursing students participated in the study and data was analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25 DISCUSSION: The mean level of knowledge was 44.41 with SD of 4.72. The mean readiness score was 79.09 with the SD of 11.77. There is no significant association between the knowledge and readiness of nursing students regarding IPEC and their demographic variables at 0.05 confidence level. CONCLUSIONS Majority of the students had moderately adequate knowledge about IPEC and high level of readiness towards IPEC. This implies that when appropriately implemented, the students will reap the benefits of IPEC, which has the potential to improve their ability to provide holistic nursing care to their patients.","Arulappan, Judie; Matua, Gerald Amandu; Alzaabi, Omar; Vincent, Sophia Cyril; Jayapal, Sathish Kumar; Al Sabei, Sulaiman Dawood; Seshan, Vidya",Nurse education today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.104865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740703/,150

Currently, there is a lack of data around overall healthcare cost for these patients and their outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality. The objective of the study was to estimate healthcare costs and outcomes associated in tracheostomy patients at a tertiary level hospital in South Australia. Design Retrospective review of prospectively collected data in patients who underwent tracheostomy between July 2009 and May 2015. Methods Overall healthcare-associated costs, length of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit stay, and mortality rates were assessed. Results A total of 454 patients with tracheostomies were examined. Majority of the tracheostomies (n = 386 (85%)) were performed in intensive care unit patients, predominantly using bedside percutaneous approach (85%). The median length of hospital stay was 44 (29-63) days and the in-hospital mortality rate was 20%. Overall total cost of managing a patient with tracheostomy was median $192,184 (inter-quartile range $122560-$295553); mean 225,200 (range $5942-$1046675) Australian dollars. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the measured outcomes, including costs, between patients who underwent percutaneous versus surgical tracheostomy and patients who underwent early versus late tracheostomy in their intensive care unit stay. Factors that predicted (adjusted R 2 = 0.53) the cost per patient were intensive care unit length of stay and hospital length of stay. Conclusion Hospitalised patients undergoing tracheostomy experience high morbidity and mortality and typically experience highly resource-intensive and costly healthcare.","Bihari, Shailesh; Prakash, Shivesh; Hakendorf, Paul; Horwood, Christopher MacBryde; Tarasenko, Steve; Holt, Andrew W; Ratcliffe, Julie; Bersten, Andrew D",Journal of the Intensive Care Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1751143718762342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30515240/,150

There is evidence to suggest desensitization to aspirin may improve symptomatology and disease control in these patients. The goal of our study was to critically appraise the literature on this topic and assess the effect of desensitization on sinonasal symptomatology. METHODS We searched EMBASE, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library for relevant literature. Studies were included if they were observational studies or randomized, controlled trials, had n > 1, and were published in English or French. Studies were excluded if they were systematic reviews. We assessed study for quality and presence of common sources of bias. RESULTS Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. In general, polyp size, polyp recurrence, nasal symptom scores, sense of smell, number of acute rhinosinusitis episodes, and systemic steroid use improved when patients were desensitized. The vast majority of studies recommend desensitization. CONCLUSION There is mounting evidence that aspirin desensitization is a valuable adjunct to treat sinonasal symptoms in the treatment of patients who have AERD.","Larivée, Natasha; Chin, Christopher J",International forum of allergy & rhinology,https://doi.org/10.1002/alr.22520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31951112/,150
86259,Converging evidence on D-amino acid oxidase-dependent enhancement of hippocampal firing activity and passive avoidance learning in rats.,2020-12-11,"BACKGROUND Cerebral palsy (CP) is a leading cause of childhood disability. The motor impairments of individuals with CP significantly affect the kinematics of an efficient gait pattern. Robotic therapies have become increasingly popular as an intervention to address this. Powered lower limb exoskeletons (PoLLE) are a novel form of robotic therapy that allow the individual to perform over-ground gait training and yet its effectiveness for CP is unknown. PURPOSE To determine the effectiveness of PoLLE use on gait in individuals with CP. METHOD A systematic search of eight electronic databases was conducted in March 2020. Studies included children (0-18 years) and or adults (18+ years) diagnosed with CP who used a PoLLE for gait training. This review was conducted and reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, with the methodology registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020177160). A modified version of the McMaster critical review form for quantitative studies was used to assess the methodological quality. Due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, a descriptive synthesis using the National Health & Medical Research Council (NHMRC) FORM framework was undertaken. RESULTS Of the 2089 studies screened, ten case series and three case studies met the inclusion criteria highlighting the current evidence base is emerging and low level. A range of PoLLEs were investigated with effectiveness measured by using a number of outcome measures. Collectively, the body of evidence indicates there is some consistent positive evidence on the effectiveness of PoLLE in improving gait in individuals with CP, with minimal adverse effects. While this is a positive and encouraging finding for an emerging technology, methodological concerns also need to be acknowledged. CONCLUSION With rapidly evolving technology, PoLLEs could play a transformative role in the lives of people impacted by CP. Ongoing research is required to further strengthen the evidence base and address current methodological concerns.","Bunge, Lucinda Rose; Davidson, Ashleigh Jade; Helmore, Benita Roslyn; Mavrandonis, Aleksandra Daniella; Page, Thomas David; Schuster-Bayly, Tegan Rochelle; Kumar, Saravana",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038471/,150

86674,Review: innovation through research in the North American pork industry.,2019,"OBJECTIVE To examine the expression and clinical significance of circulating CD4+ FoxP3- CXCR5- CXCR3+ PD-1hi cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS CD4+ FoxP3- CXCR5- CXCR3+ PD-1hi cells in peripheral blood of 35 patients with active RA, 17 with RA in stable remission, and 24 healthy controls were analyzed by flow cytometry. Serum IgG and circulating plasmablast percentages were measured and correlations with CD4+ FoxP3- CXCR5- CXCR3+ PD-1hi cells were systematically analyzed. Disease Activity Scale 28 (DAS28) scores were also calculated and correlation analysis with CD4+ FoxP3- CXCR5- CXCR3+ PD-1hi cells was conducted. The levels of CD4+ FoxP3- CXCR5- CXCR3+ PD-1hi cells were compared before and after disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug treatment. Cytokine levels in plasma and cytokine secretion in CD4 cells were measured and their correlations with CD4+ FoxP3- CXCR5- CXCR3+ PD-1hi cells were further analyzed. RESULTS The levels of CD4+ FoxP3- CXCR5- CXCR3+ PD-1hi cells in the peripheral blood of patients with active RA were significantly increased compared with healthy controls. CD4+ FoxP3- CXCR5- CXCR3+ PD-1hi cells in patients with active RA were positively correlated with serum IgG and DAS28 scores. CD4+ FoxP3- CXCR5- CXCR3+ PD-1hi cells were significantly decreased in patients after treatment. Plasma interleukin-10 concentrations and interleukin-10-positive CD4 cell percentages were significantly positively correlated with CD4+ FoxP3- CXCR5- CXCR3+ PD-1hi cell levels. CONCLUSION Circulating CD4+ FoxP3- CXCR5- CXCR3+ PD-1hi cells in patients with active RA are increased and could reflect the severity of the disease, which may play a potential role in the pathogenesis of RA.","Zhao, Lei; Li, Zhenxue; Zeng, Xingyue; Xia, Changsheng; Xu, Lijuan; Xu, Qinzhu; Song, Ying; Liu, Chen",International journal of rheumatic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-185x.14170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34227243/,150

MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-seven patients, who already were confirmed with COVID-19 using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were admitted to our hospital due to chest pain with STEMI. The median patient age was 66 years (range: 27-84 years). Female/male ratio was 22/15. We performed a second RT-PCR test in all patients. We investigated myocardial enzymes (creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), cardiac troponin-I (c-TnI), and C-reactive protein (CRP), and liver enzymes (alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) also were measured. Blood d-dimer, thromboplastin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and fibrinogen were investigated. Transcutaneous oxygen saturation was monitored for each patient in the emergency department (ED). To evaluate myocardial wall abnormalities, transthoracic echocardiography was performed. RESULTS Coronary artery disorders requiring revascularization were detected in 25 patients (67.5%). There was no evidence of coronary artery disease in the remaining 12 patients. Out of 25, nine coronary artery disease patients had a history of coronary intervention (24.3%). All patients had high levels of myocardial enzyme release. Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) were performed in patients with culprit lesion(s). Success rate of PCI was 87.5% (N = 21). The median number of stent use was 2.9±0.7 (range: 1-4). Because PCI failed in four patients, we suggested elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery after medical treatment. Six patients required re-intervention owing to early stent thrombosis (30%). Seven patients died after PCI (33.3%). For patients with negative or positive RT-PCR test results, we performed thoracic computed tomography (CT), which is a sensitive diagnostic method for COVID-19. Interlobular septal and pleural thickening with patchy bronchiectasis in the bilateral or unilaterally lower and/or middle lobe(s) were the main pathologies in 24 patients. D-dimer, fibrinogen, and CRP levels were high in 11 PCI patients with bilaterally pulmonary involvement by COVID-19 (52.3%), while fibrin degradation products did not significantly change. For three patients with normal coronary arteries with a transient hypokinesia or hypokinesia as result of myocarditis, we decided to perform atypical Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. We medically treated using inodilator (levosimendan), diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. To prevent the risk of thromboembolism, we also administered a heparin drip. The myocardial contractility of the apex did improve, and patients were discharged from the hospital, with the exception of one young female patient. She is following in the ICU with stabil hemodynamics. CONCLUSION Chest pain with STEMI can develop in patients with confirmed COVID-19. Nearly one-third of patients had COVID-19 with chest pain and concomitant STEMI and normal coronary angiography (32.4%). Urgent PCI may be performed in hemodynamically unstable patients with high mortality. Complications, including sudden cardiac arrest, severe ventricular arrhythmia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, related to COVID-19 patients with normal coronary arteries.","Keskin, Gökhan; Uysal, Ayhan; Hafız, Erhan; Dogan, Omer Faruk",The heart surgery forum,https://doi.org/10.1532/hsf.3567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173766/,150
87353,When an emerging disease becomes endemic.,2017,"Understanding the global dynamical behavior of a network of coupled oscillators has been a topic of immense research in many fields of science and engineering. Various factors govern the resulting dynamical behavior of such networks, including the number of oscillators and their coupling schemes. Although these factors are seldom significant in large populations, a small change in them can drastically affect the global behavior in small populations. In this paper, we perform an experimental investigation on the effect of these factors on the coupled behavior of a minimal network of candle-flame oscillators. We observe that strongly coupled oscillators exhibit the global behavior of in-phase synchrony and amplitude death, irrespective of the number and the topology of oscillators. However, when they are weakly coupled, their global behavior exhibits the intermittent occurrence of multiple stable states in time. We report the experimental discovery of partial amplitude death in a network of candle-flame oscillators, in addition to the observation of other dynamical states including clustering, chimera, and weak chimera. We also show that closed-loop networks tend to hold global synchronization for longer duration as compared to open-loop networks.","Manoj, Krishna; Pawar, Samadhan A; Sujith, R I",Physical review.

Enveloped viruses are most commonly known to cause emerging and recurring infectious diseases. Viral and cell membrane fusion is the major key event in case of enveloped viruses that required for their entry into the cell. Viral fusion proteins are playing important role in fusion process and in infection establishment. Because of this, fusion process targeting antivirals become an interest to fight against viral diseases caused by enveloped virus. Lower respiratory tract infections casing viruses like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) are examples of such enveloped viruses that are at top in public health issues. Here, we summarized the viral fusion protein targeted antiviral peptides along with their mechanism and specific design to combat viral fusion process. The pandemic COVID-19, severe respiratory syndrome disease is outbreak worldwide. There are no definitive drugs yet but few are in on-going trial. Here, an approach of fragment based drug design (FBDD) methodology was used to identify the broad spectrum agent target to the conserved region of fusion protein of SARS CoV-2. Three dipeptides (DL, LQ and ID) were chosen from the library and designed by the systematic combination along with their possible modifications of amino acids to the target sites. Designed peptides were docked with targeted fusion protein after energy minimization. Results show strong and significant binding affinity (DL = -60.1 kcal/mol; LQ = -62.8 kcal/mol; ID= -71.5 kcal/mol) during interaction. Any one of the active peptides from the developed libraries may help to block competitively the target sites to successfully control COVID-19.","Manna, Sounik; Baindara, Piyush; Mandal, Santi M",Current protein & peptide science,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389203721666200908164641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901582/,150

Simulation training on cadavers may be beneficial. The aim of this study was to analyze a skill-training aiming to enhance ICU-fellows´ performance. METHODS A skill-training was prepared for chest tube insertion, pericardiocentesis, and cricothyroidotomy. Supervision levels (SL) for entrustable professional activities (EPA) were applied to evaluate skill performance. Pre- and post-training, SL and fellows´ self- versus consultants´ external assessment was compared. Time on skill training was compared to conventional training in the ICU-setting. RESULTS Comparison of pre/post external assessment showed reduced required SL for chest tube insertion, pericardiocentesis, and cricothyroidotomy. Self- and external assessed SL did not significantly correlate for pre-training/post-training pericardiocentesis and post-training cricothyroidotomy. Correlations were observed for self- and external assessment SL for chest tube insertion and pre-assessment for cricothyroidotomy. Compared to conventional training in the ICU-setting, chest tube insertion training may further be time-saving. CONCLUSIONS Emergency skill training separated from a daily clinical ICU-setting appeared feasible and useful to enhance skill performance in ICU fellows and may reduce respective SL. We observed that in dedicated skill-training sessions, required time resources would be somewhat reduced compared to conventional training methods.","Zante, Bjoern; Schefold, Joerg C",BMC medical education,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-020-02419-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33298042/,150

It remains unclear to what extent new evidence of therapeutic procedures is transferred to the ""real-world"" of everyday hospital care. We analyzed epidemiologic and procedural therapeutic trends of hospitalized acute stroke patients in Germany by the comparison of administrative hospital data of the years 2008 (n=219,359) and 2012 (n=239,394). Proportion of specialized SU care rose from 43.4% to 56.9%. Even in age-matched analysis women were less likely to obtain this procedure. Rate of IVT increased from 5.6% to 10.2%. 32% of IVT therapies in 2012 were performed in patients over 80 years. Number of MT increased exponentially from 298 to 3906 procedures. Number of DHC did not increase significantly (2008=636; 2011=796). A strong momentum in transferring scientific insights to the ""real-world"" stroke care in Germany was documented. Increase of IVT therapy is largely due to the increase of off-label treatment. Almost every 46 th patient <80 years was treated by MT in 2012. Despite proven benefits in selected patients, utilization of DHC remained almost stable.","Krogias, Christos; Bartig, Dirk; Kitzrow, Martin; Weber, Ralph; Eyding, Jens",Journal of the neurological sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2014.07.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25109534/,150

The restrictions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to negatively impact the diet, training and fitness of these individuals due to restrictions in place to slow the spread of the virus. AIM To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the diet, training and fitness of Masters-level cyclists. METHODS 32 Masters cyclists (12 males, 20 females; mean age 47 ± 10 years) completed two incremental exercise tests one month apart during the pandemic to assess sport-specific fitness. Participants also completed online questionnaires to report their sedentary behavior and dietary intake before and during the pandemic, and their training volume and intensity for a specified week in February (before the pandemic) and each of March, April and May (during the pandemic). RESULTS No differences were seen in fitness (p = 0.6), training volume (p = 0.24) or intensity (p = 0.79) and sedentary behavior (p = 0.14) during the pandemic. Energy intake was unchanged (p = 1.0) during the pandemic, but participants consumed lower amounts of key nutrients such as fiber, vitamin A, omega-3 fatty acids and potassium (p < 0.05) while consuming more alcohol (p = 0.008) and vitamin C (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Our data shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has undesirable effects on nutrient and alcohol intake of Masters cyclists without impacting their training regimes, which may have adverse effects on their overall health and fitness in the long term.","Shaw, Keely A; Bertrand, Leandy; Deprez, Dalton; Ko, Jongbum; Zello, Gordon A; Chilibeck, Philip D",Nutrition and health,https://doi.org/10.1177/02601060211002350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759633/,150

METHODOLOGY To acquire the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 in Guizhou province, we collected data from 169 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 related cases. We described the demographic characteristics of the cases and estimated the incubation period, serial interval and the effective reproduction number. We also presented two representative case studies in Guizhou province: Case Study 1 was an example of the asymptomatic carrier; while Case Study 2 was an example of a large and complex infection chain that involved four different regions, spanning three provinces and eight families. RESULTS Two peaks in the incidence distribution associated with COVID-19 in Guizhou province were related to the 6.04 days (95% CI: 5.00 - 7.10) of incubation period and 6.14±2.21 days of serial interval. We also discussed the effectiveness of the control measures based on the instantaneous effective reproduction number that was a constantly declining curve. CONCLUSIONS As of February 2, 2020, the estimated effective reproduction number was below 1, and no new cases were reported since February 26. These showed that Guizhou Province had achieved significant progress in preventing the spread of the epidemic. The medical isolation of close contacts was consequential. Meanwhile, the asymptomatic carriers and the super-spreaders must be isolated in time, who would cause a widespread infection.","Ping, Kaike; Lei, Mingyu; Gou, Yun; Tao, Zhongfa; Yao, Guanghai; Hu, Can; Tao, Qin; Zou, Zhiting; Wang, Dingming; Li, Shijun; Huang, Yan",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.12818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33839714/,150

This article presents our multicenter, large-scale experience with SAVE. METHODS The study involved a retrospective core team analysis of 200 patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy using the SAVE technique due to intracranial LVO at 4 German centers. Primary endpoints were first-pass and overall complete/near complete reperfusion, defined as a modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) score of 2c and 3. Secondary endpoints were the number of passes, time from groin puncture to reperfusion, embolization to new territories (ENT), postinterventional symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and favorable outcome at discharge, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≤ 2. RESULTS The median age was 78 years (interquartile range IQR 68-85). Median National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) at admission was 16 (IQR 12-20). Occlusions sites were: internal carotid artery (ICA-T) in 39/200 (19.5%), M1 in 126/200 (63%), M2 in 30/200 (15%), and others in 5/200 (2.5%) cases. The primary endpoints were documented in 114/200 (57% first pass mTICI 2c or 3) and 154/200 (77% overall mTICI 2c or 3) patients, respectively. The overall median time from groin puncture to reperfusion was 34 min (IQR 25-52) with a median of 1 (IQR 1-2) attempts. An ENT was observed in 3 patients (1.5%) and the rate of sICH was 2.6%. The rate of successful reperfusion (mTICI ≥ 2b) on final angiograms was 95%. At discharge, 73/200 (36.5%) patients revealed a favorable outcome. CONCLUSION Mechanical thrombectomy using the SAVE technique seems to be effective, fast and safe. First-line use of SAVE leads to high rates of complete and near complete reperfusion.","Maus, Volker; Henkel, Silja; Riabikin, Alexander; Riedel, Christian; Behme, Daniel; Tsogkas, Ioannis; Hesse, Amelie Carolina; Abdullayev, Nuran; Jansen, Olav; Wiesmann, Martin; Mpotsaris, Anastasios; Psychogios, Marios-Nikos",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-018-0702-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30027326/,150

The risk to restarting activities is unknown. Objective Assess the risk of SARS-Cov-2 virus contagion, both to patients and healthcare workers in relation to esophageal and anorectal functional tests during the pandemic without protective measures. Method A questionnaire was designed to find out whether patients and healthcare workers had COVID-19, confirmed either by a test or only compatible symptoms, after functional studies were performed from January until March 2020. Results 263 (92.9%) patients answered the survey. In the two weeks after functional test, four (1.52%) patients had confirmed COVID-19 (adjusted rate 8.34 cases per 1,000 (95% CI -0.06-16.74), OR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.83-0.85), p<0.001), no one after anorectal manometry. Other five had only compatible symptoms, total 9 (3.42%) (adjusted rate 27.50 cases / 1,000 (95% CI: 7.27-47.74), OR 2.84 (95% CI: 2.81-2.87). In the total study period 18.25% had COVID-19 confirmed or with compatible symptoms. The average of days between the procedure and the first day of symptoms was progressively shortened: January 56 days, February 33 days, March 10.5 days. Two out of 10 healthcare workers (20%) were confirmed with COVID-19. Conclusions The risk of COVID-19 contagion when performing functional tests is low and more related to the evolution of the pandemic than to the procedures themselves. The small number of healthcare workers included in the study does not allow a definitive conclusion to be drawn on their risk of contagion.","Pérez de la Serna Y Bueno, Julio; Ruiz de León San Juan, Antonio; Sevilla Mantilla, Concepción; Ciriza de Los Ríos, Constanza; Atarain Valles, Ana; Aparicio Cabezudo, Marta; García Pravia, Laura; Olivares Quintanar, David; Rey Díaz-Rubio, Enrique",Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,https://doi.org/10.17235/reed.2021.7767/2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33733801/,150

Since the beginning of the 20th century, advances have been made in the materials that can be used to produce an esophageal substitute. Three approaches to scaffold-based tissue engineering have yielded good results. The first development concerned non-absorbable constructs based on silicone and collagen. The need to remove the silicone tube is the main disadvantage of this material. Polymeric absorbable scaffolds have been used since the 1990s. The main polymeric material used is poly (glycolic) acid combined with collagen. The problem of stenosis remains prevalent in most studies using an absorbable construct. Finally, decellularized scaffolds have been used since 2000. The promises of this new approach are unfulfilled. Indeed, stenosis occurs when the esophageal defect is circumferential regardless of the scaffold materials. Cell supplementation can decrease the rate of stenosis, but the type(s) of cells and their roles have not been defined. Finally, esophageal tissue engineering cannot provide a functional esophageal substitute, and further development is necessary prior to conducting human clinical studies.","Luc, Guillaume; Durand, Marlène; Collet, Denis; Guillemot, Fabien; Bordenave, Laurence",Expert review of medical devices,https://doi.org/10.1586/17434440.2014.870470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24387697/,150

When health workers are suddenly faced with such a serious event, it is important to assess their mental health in order to determine whether they can meet the challenge effectively. Herein, Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was used to assess the psychological problems of 382 front-line medical staff in Chongqing. The average SCL-90 score was low, and no specific mental health problems were found. With the exception of the phobic-anxiety factor, the scores were close to normal values. A single-factor analysis of variance showed that the SCL-90 scores of male and older staff were higher than those of female and younger staff, implying that they were at greater psychological risk. We found that both gender and age have a significant impact on mental health, and our findings suggest that more attention should be given to the mental health of male and older front-line medical staff.","Wang, Shasha; Li, Ying; Li, Xin; Du, Cuiping; Yang, Yi; Xiong, Xiaoli; Wang, Yao","Psychology, health & medicine",https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1939889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34154473/,150

90293,Microwave ablation for hepatic malignancies: a multiinstitutional analysis.,2014,"GroES is an indispensable chaperonin virtually found throughout all life forms. Consequently, mutations of this protein must be critically scrutinized by natural selection. Nevertheless, the homolog from a potentially virulent gastric pathogen, Helicobacter pylori, strikingly features a histidine/cysteine-rich C terminus that shares no significant homology with other family members. Additionally, three more (H45, C51, and C53) are uniquely present in its apical domain. The statistical analyses show that these residues may have originated from negative selection, presumably driven by either dependent or independent amino acid mutations. In the absence of the C-terminal metal-binding domain, the mutant protein still exhibits a substantial capacity for zinc binding in vivo. The biochemical properties of site-directed mutants indicate that H45, C51, and C53 make up an oxidation-sensitive zinc-binding site that may donate the bound metal to a zinc acceptor. Of interest, bismuth antiulcer drugs strongly bind at this site (K(d) of approximately 7 x 10(-26) M), replacing the bound zinc and consequently inducing the disruption of the quaternary structure. Because biological features by negative selection are usually inert to change during evolution, this study sheds light on a promising field whereby medicines can be designed or improved to specifically target the residues that uniquely evolved in pathogenic proteins so as to retard the emergence of drug resistance.","Cun, Shujian; Sun, Hongzhe",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0913970107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20194796/,150
90390,Assessment of a computerized quantitative quality control tool for kidney whole slide image biopsies.,2020-11-16,"Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 17 May 2020: notifications = 7,075; deaths = 100. The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March. Social distancing measures, public health action and the reduction in international travel have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community. Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a continued very low proportion of people testing positive. These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission. It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. New cases of COVID-19 are currently being reported by by only some jurisdictions, albeit at relatively low rates. Although case numbers are low, new cases tend to still be a mix of overseas-acquired and locally-acquired infections. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of new cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years. One third of all cases in this age group have been associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, while the number of new cases each day remains relatively stable at the global level, some areas such as Brazil and India are showing a dramatic rise in reported cases. Although some low-income countries have so far reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of true disease incidence.",,Communicable diseases intelligence,https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2020.44.45; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32522141/,150

This study aims to demonstrate that including experts on infectious diseases (ID) within the antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programme team in primary care settings achieves higher reductions in overall antibiotic consumption and increases the quality of prescription. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A multicentre, cluster-randomised, blinded clinical trial will be conducted between 2021 and 2023. Six primary care centres will be randomly assigned to an advanced or a standard AMS programme. The advanced AMS programme will consist of a standard AMS programme combined with the possibility that general practitioners (GP) will discuss patients' therapies with ID experts telephonically during working days and biweekly meetings. The main endpoint will be overall antibiotic consumption, defined as daily defined dose per 1000 inhabitants per day (DHD). Secondary end-points will be: (1) unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in patients diagnosed with upper respiratory tract or urinary tract infection, (2) adequacy of antibiotic prescription, (3) reattendance to GP or emergency room within 30 days after the initial GP visit and (4) hospital admissions for any reason within 30 days after the GP visit. Two secondary endpoints (unnecessary antibiotic therapy and adequacy of therapy) will be evaluated by blinded investigators.We will select three clusters (centres) per arm (coverage of 147 644 inhabitants) which will allow the rejection of the null hypothesis of equal consumption with a power of 80%, assuming a moderate intracluster correlation of 0.2, an intracluster variance of 4 and a mean difference of 1 DHD. The type I error will be set at 5%. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The protocol was reviewed and approved by local ethics committees.

We previously reported excellent outcomes with the abbreviated Stanford V regimen. Herein we report updated results with median follow-up >10 years on survival, therapy-related late effects, and impact of disease risk factors on patient outcomes. METHODS AND MATERIALS The XXXXXX and YYYYYY studies enrolled patients with stage I-IIA non-bulky ESHL. Patients received eight weeks of Stanford V chemotherapy followed by 30 Gy modified involved-field radiotherapy (mIFRT) (XXXXXX) or Stanford V-C + 20 Gy mIFRT (YYYYYY). Patients were categorized as favorable or unfavorable risk per German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) criteria and outcomes between groups compared. RESULTS 129 patients were enrolled (68 favorable and 61 unfavorable risk). In the XXXXXX study (n = 87), at median follow-up of 19.7 years, 5-, 10-, and 15-year PFS and OS were 95.4%/97.7%, 91.8%/96.5%, and 91.8%/95.3%, respectively. In the YYYYYY study (n = 42), at median follow-up of 13.5 years, the 5-, 10-, and 15-year PFS and OS were 92.9%/100%, 92.9%/100%, and 88.4%/91.9%, respectively. PFS (p = 0.86) and OS (p = 0.86) were not significantly different between studies. There were also no significant differences between studies in patients with favorable or unfavorable risk for PFS (F: p = 0.53; U: p = 0.96), OS (F: p = 0.99; U: p = 0.78), secondary malignancies (F: p = .74; U: p = 1.0), and cardiovascular complications (F: no cases; U: p = 1.0). CONCLUSIONS The XXXXXX and YYYYYY studies achieve high rates of durable remission. 20 versus 30 Gy mIFRT and cyclophosphamide substituted for mechlorethamine did not compromise nodal control, PFS, or OS in both favorable and unfavorable risk disease.

91249,Saikosaponins: a review of pharmacological effects.,2018,"INTRODUCTION While the impact of demographic factors on postoperative outcomes has been examined, little is known about the intersection between social vulnerability and residential diversity on postoperative outcomes following cancer surgery. METHODS Individuals who underwent a lung or colon resection for cancer were identified in the 2016-2017 Medicare database. Data were merged with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention social vulnerability index and a residential diversity index was calculated. Logistic regression models were utilized to estimate the probability of postoperative outcomes. RESULTS Among 55 742 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent lung (39.4%) or colon (60.6%) resection, most were male (46.6%), White (90.2%) and had a mean age of 75.3 years. After adjustment for competing risk factors, both social vulnerability and residential diversity were associated with mortality and other postoperative outcomes. In assessing the intersection of social vulnerability and residential diversity, synergistic effects were noted as patients from counties with low social vulnerability and high residential diversity had the lowest probability of 30-day mortality (3.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.0-3.5) while patients from counties with high social vulnerability and low diversity had a higher probability of 30-day postoperative death (5.2%, 95% CI: 4.6-5.8; odds ratio: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03). CONCLUSION Social vulnerability and residential diversity were independently associated with postoperative outcomes. The intersection of these two social health determinants demonstrated a synergistic effect on the risk of adverse outcomes following lung and colon cancer surgery.","Diaz, Adrian; Dalmacy, Djhenne; Hyer, J Madison; Tsilimigras, Diamantis; Pawlik, Timothy M",Journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.26588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196009/,150

In order to more effectively interrupt the chain of transmission, new strategies will be required to detect those with latent disease who contribute to furthering transmission. To improve the ability to diagnose leprosy earlier in asymptomatic infected individuals, we examined the combined use of two well-known biomarkers of M. leprae infection, namely the presence of M. leprae DNA by PCR from earlobe slit skin smears (SSS) and positive antibody titers to the M. leprae-specific antigen, Phenolic Glycolipid I (anti-PGL-I) from leprosy patients and household contacts living in seven hyperendemic cities in the northern state of Pará, Brazilian Amazon. Combining both tests increased sensitivity, specificity and accuracy over either test alone. A total of 466 individuals were evaluated, including 87 newly diagnosed leprosy patients, 52 post-treated patients, 296 household contacts and 31 healthy endemic controls. The highest frequency of double positives (PGL-I+/RLEP+) were detected in the new case group (40/87, 46%) with lower numbers for treated (12/52, 23.1%), household contacts (46/296, 15.5%) and healthy endemic controls (0/31, 0%). The frequencies in these groups were reversed for double negatives (PGL-I-/RLEP-) for new cases (6/87, 6.9%), treated leprosy cases (15/52, 28.8%) and the highest in household contacts (108/296, 36.5%) and healthy endemic controls (24/31, 77.4%). The data strongly suggest that household contacts that are double positive have latent disease, are likely contributing to shedding and transmission of disease to their close contacts and are at the highest risk of progressing to clinical disease. Proposed strategies to reduce leprosy transmission in highly endemic areas may include chemoprophylactic treatment of this group of individuals to stop the spread of bacilli to eventually lower new case detection rates in these areas.","da Silva, Moises Batista; Li, Wei; Bouth, Raquel Carvalho; Gobbo, Angélica Rita; Messias, Ana Caroline Cunha; Moraes, Tania Mara Pires; Jorge, Erika Vanessa Oliveira; Barreto, Josafá Gonçalves; Filho, Fred Bernardes; Conde, Guilherme Augusto Barros; Frade, Marco Andrey Cipriani; Salgado, Claudio Guedes; Spencer, John Stewart",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984058/,150

The aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview of recommendations on this topic in guidelines from member countries of the European Society of Coloproctology, with supporting evidence. METHOD A systematic search of Medline, Embase and the guideline databases Trip database, BMJ Best Practice and Guidelines International Network was performed. Quality assessment included use of the AGREE-II tool. All topics with recommendations from included guidelines were identified and categorized. For each subtopic, a conclusion was made followed by the degree of consensus and the highest level of evidence. RESULTS Twenty-one guidelines were included. The majority recommended that structured follow-up should be offered, except for patients in whom treatment of recurrence would be inappropriate. It was generally agreed that clinical visits, measurement of carcinoembryoinc antigen and liver imaging should be part of follow-up, based on a high level of evidence, although the frequency is controversial. There was also consensus on imaging of the chest and pelvis in rectal cancer, as well as endoscopy, based on lower levels of evidence and with a level of intensity that was contradictory. CONCLUSION In available guidelines, multimodal follow-up after treatment with curative intent of colorectal cancer is widely recommended, but the exact content and intensity are highly controversial. International agreement on the optimal follow-up schedule is unlikely to be achieved on current evidence, and further research should refocus on individualized 'patient-driven' follow-up and new biomarkers.","Bastiaenen, V P; Hovdenak Jakobsen, I; Labianca, R; Martling, A; Morton, D G; Primrose, J N; Tanis, P J; Laurberg, S",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.14503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30506553/,150
93449,Prevention of airway fires: testing the safety of endotracheal tubes and surgical devices in a mechanical model.,2015,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Currently, most implants used for reinforcement in surgical treatment of pelvic floor disorders are knitted monofilament polypropylene (PP). While previously recognized as inert, PP is associated with high complication rates. Some recent literature suggests polyester prosthetics based on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), which may be more inert in vivo. METHODS A sample of 100 implants explanted from patients due to complications was examined to evaluate the relative degradation characteristics of PP and PET prosthetics. Histological, microscopic (scanning electron microscopy, SEM) and chemical analysis (Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)) were conducted on these explants. RESULTS Poly(ethylene terephtahlate) explants appeared to sustain less degradation in vivo than the PP explants observed in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to evaluate synthetic implants used in a vaginal approach for pelvic floor reinforcement. The study provides evidence contrary to published literature characterizing PP as inert in such applications. Additionally, the study suggests the need for clinical trials comparatively investigating the performance of new types of monofilament prosthetics, such as those comprising PET.","Clavé, Arnaud; Yahi, Hannah; Hammou, Jean-Claude; Montanari, Suzelei; Gounon, Pierre; Clavé, Henri",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-009-1021-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20052576/,150

93546,Ebola Preparedness: Diagnosis Improvement Using Rapid Approaches for Proficiency Testing.,2017,"BACKGROUND Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections like influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome pose a global threat. Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent their spread. OBJECTIVES To review the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, Issue 3), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to October 2010), OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965), EMBASE (1990 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to October 2010), LILACS (2008 to October 2010), Indian MEDLARS (2008 to October 2010) and IMSEAR (2008 to October 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA In this update, two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria to all identified and retrieved articles and extracted data. We scanned 3775 titles, excluded 3560 and retrieved full papers of 215 studies, to include 66 papers of 67 studies. We included physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, hand hygiene) to prevent respiratory virus transmission. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohorts, case-controls, before-after and time series studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used a standardised form to assess trial eligibility. We assessed RCTs by randomisation method, allocation generation, concealment, blinding and follow up. We assessed non-RCTs for potential confounders and classified them as low, medium and high risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS We included 67 studies including randomised controlled trials and observational studies with a mixed risk of bias. A total number of participants is not included as the total would be made up of a heterogenous set of observations (participant people, observations on participants and countries (object of some studies)). The risk of bias for five RCTs and most cluster-RCTs was high. Observational studies were of mixed quality. Only case-control data were sufficiently homogeneous to allow meta-analysis. The highest quality cluster-RCTs suggest respiratory virus spread can be prevented by hygienic measures, such as handwashing, especially around younger children. Benefit from reduced transmission from children to household members is broadly supported also in other study designs where the potential for confounding is greater. Nine case-control studies suggested implementing transmission barriers, isolation and hygienic measures are effective at containing respiratory virus epidemics. Surgical masks or N95 respirators were the most consistent and comprehensive supportive measures. N95 respirators were non-inferior to simple surgical masks but more expensive, uncomfortable and irritating to skin. Adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to decrease respiratory disease transmission remains uncertain. Global measures, such as screening at entry ports, led to a non-significant marginal delay in spread. There was limited evidence that social distancing was effective, especially if related to the risk of exposure. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Simple and low-cost interventions would be useful for reducing transmission of epidemic respiratory viruses. Routine long-term implementation of some measures assessed might be difficult without the threat of an epidemic.","Jefferson, Tom; Del Mar, Chris B; Dooley, Liz; Ferroni, Eliana; Al-Ansary, Lubna A; Bawazeer, Ghada A; van Driel, Mieke L; Nair, Sreekumaran; Jones, Mark A; Thorning, Sarah; Conly, John M",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd006207.pub4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21735402/,150

OBJECTIVE To analyze perioperative results and long-term outcome of children with obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction, operated on with RALP compared to OP. PATIENTS AND METHODS Children ≤15 years operated on with RALP or OP from 2000 through 2013 were reviewed. Patient demographics, perioperative data, postoperative complications, and long-term outcome were evaluated. The outcome was based on pre- and postoperative examination of renal function, hydronephrosis and flank pain. RESULTS 129 pyeloplasties (84 OP, 39 RALP, 6 reoperations) on 123 patients were included. RALP had significantly longer operative time and shorter postoperative hospital stay, compared to OP. No difference was found in postoperative need of morphine or complication rates. Mean follow-up for RALP with ultrasound was 29 and 25 months with renal scan, compared to 34 and 28 months, respectively, for OP. The success rate for flank pain was 96 and 94 %, for hydronephrosis 93 and 95 %, and renal function 94 and 92 %, for RALP and OP, respectively. CONCLUSIONS RALP is a safe method, with advantages compared to OP, and with the same success rate. This study supports the use of RALP in children.","Salö, Martin; Sjöberg Altemani, Tania; Anderberg, Magnus",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-016-3869-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26833312/,150

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study of neonates that received a first blood transfusion while having an indwelling arterial line. We compared PaO2, SaO2, SpO2, SaO2/PaO2 ratio and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 12 h before and after blood transfusion. RESULTS Post-transfusion neonates had higher PaO2 and SaO2, had lower SaO2/PaO2 ratio, and received higher FiO2 with no change in SpO2. CONCLUSIONS Post-transfusion, neonates had lower hemoglobin oxygen affinity. They received higher FiO2 and had higher PaO2 at the same SpO2. We speculate that FiO2 was increased in order to maintain SpO2. Larger prospective trials are needed to confirm our findings.","Nitzan, Itamar; Hammerman, Cathy; Mimouni, Francis B; Bin-Nun, Alona",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41372-018-0079-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29467516/,150
93920,Artesunate Activation by Heme in an Aqueous Medium.,2019-10-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Mechanical thrombectomy for patients with acute ischemic stroke with tandem occlusions has been shown to present varying reperfusion successes and clinical outcomes. However, the heterogeneity of tandem occlusion etiology has been strongly neglected in previous studies. We retrospectively investigated patients with acute ischemic stroke atherothrombotic tandem occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS All consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke with atherothrombotic tandem occlusions treated with mechanical thrombectomy in our center between September 2009 and April 2015 were analyzed. They were compared with patients with acute ischemic stroke with dissection-related tandem occlusion and isolated intracranial occlusion treated during the same period. Comparative univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted, including demographic data, safety, and rates of successful recanalization and good clinical outcome. RESULTS Despite comparable baseline severity of neurologic deficits and infarct core extension, patients with atherothrombotic tandem occlusions were older (P < .001), were more frequently smokers (P < .001), and had globally more cardiovascular risk factors (P < .001) than the other 2 groups of patients. The patients with atherothrombotic tandem occlusions had significantly longer procedural times (P < .001), lower recanalization rates (P = .004), and higher global burden of procedural complications (P < .001). In this group, procedural complications (OR = 0.15, P = .02) and the TICI 2b/3 reperfusion scores (OR = 17.76, P = .002) were independently predictive factors of favorable clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that atherothrombotic tandem occlusions represent a peculiar and different nosologic entity compared with dissection-related tandem occlusions. This challenging cause of acute ischemic stroke should be differentiated from other etiologies in patient management in future prospective studies.","Eker, O F; Panni, P; Dargazanli, C; Marnat, G; Arquizan, C; Machi, P; Mourand, I; Gascou, G; Le Bars, E; Costalat, V; Bonafé, A",AJNR.

Paradigm Shift with Three-Dimensional Printing.",2017,"Tools have been developed to facilitate communication and support information exchange between people diagnosed with cancer and their physicians. Patient-reported outcome measures, question prompt lists, patient-held records, tape recordings of consultations, decision aids, and survivorship care plans have all been promoted as potential tools, and there is extensive literature exploring their impact on patient outcomes. Eleven systematic reviews of studies evaluating tools to facilitate patient-physician communication were reviewed and summarized in this overview of systematic reviews. Across the systematic reviews, 87 publications reported on 84 primary studies involving 15,381 participants. Routine use of patient-reported outcome measures and feedback of results to clinicians can improve pain management, physician-patient communication, and symptom detection and control; increase utilization of supportive care; and increase patient involvement in care. Question prompt lists can increase the number of questions asked by patients without increasing consultation length and may encourage them to reflect and plan questions before the consultation. There is limited benefit in audio recording consultations or using patient-held records during consultations. Physicians should be supported by adequately resourced health services to respond effectively to the range of clinical and broader patient needs identified through the routine use of tools to facilitate communication.","Licqurish, Sharon M; Cook, Olivia Y; Pattuwage, Loyal P; Saunders, Christobel; Jefford, Michael; Koczwara, Bogda; Johnson, Claire E; Emery, Jon D",CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339560/,150
94440,The Issue of Survival After Colorectal Liver Metastasis Surgery: Parenchyma Sparing vs. Radicality.,2018,"Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a fundamental molecular technique that provides information on protein expression in the context of spatial localization and tissue morphology. IHC is used in all facets of pathology from identifying infectious agents or characterizing tumors in diagnostics, to characterizing cellular and molecular processes in investigative and experimental studies. Confidence in an IHC assay is primarily driven by the degree to which it is validated. There are many approaches to validate an IHC assay's specificity including bioinformatics approaches using published protein sequences, careful design of positive and negative tissue controls, use of cell pellets with known target protein expression, corroboration of IHC findings with western blots and other analytical methods, and replacement of the primary antibody with an appropriate negative control reagent. Each approach has inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the thoughtful use of these approaches provides cumulative evidence, or a weight of evidence, to support the IHC assay's specificity and build confidence in a study's conclusions. Although it is difficult to be 100% confident in the specificity of any IHC assay, it is important to consider how validation approaches provide evidence to support or to question the specificity of labeling, and how that evidence affects the overall interpretation of a study's results. In this review, we discuss different approaches for IHC antibody validation, with an emphasis on the characterization of antibody specificity in investigative studies. While this review is not prescriptive, it is hoped that it will be thought provoking when considering the interpretation of IHC results.","Webster, Joshua D; Solon, Margaret; Gibson-Corley, Katherine N",Veterinary pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985820960132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975488/,150
94912,Developmental pathogenicity of 4-repeat human tau is lost with the P301L mutation in genetically matched tau-transgenic mice.,2019,"INTRODUCTION Encorafenib (Braftovi) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, in combination with binimetinib (Mektovi). According to the product label of encorafenib, there are no specific treatment recommendations in case of an overdose. CASE PRESENTATION We report on a 63-year-old man who ingested a double dose (900 mg) of encorafenib for 16 days. He developed overall minor chronic overdose symptoms such as nausea and vomiting grade 1 and muscle pain. Based on the most occurring adverse events of encorafenib, liver values, kidney function parameters and QTc interval were measured. Kidney function parameters were normal, whereas liver values were slightly increased (grade 1) and QTc slightly prolonged. The plasma concentration 3 h after the last dose was 2110 ng/mL. CONCLUSION We describe the course of a case with a chronic overdose during 16 days of the double dose of encorafenib as well as the followed approach, which could be taken into account when observing an encorafenib overdose. Providing information in times of Covid-19 is challenging, but remains necessary for good clinical care.","Mian, Paola; Meussen, Elvera; Piersma, Djura; Lankheet, Nienke A G",Anti-cancer drugs,https://doi.org/10.1097/cad.0000000000001052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33587356/,150

METHODS Review of home care enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and emergency care, and Covid-19 shielding categories as per UK government guidance. New clinical pathways developed to manage patients safely during the pandemic; staff wellbeing initiatives described. RESULTS LSDU staff redeployed and/or had additional roles to support increased needs of hospitalised Covid-19 patients. During the first lockdown in March 2020, 286 of 602 LSD patients were shielding; 72 of 221 had home care enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) infusions interrupted up to 12 weeks. During the pandemic, there was a 12% reduction in home care nursing support required, with patients learning to self-cannulate or require support for cannulation only. There were no increased adverse clinical events during this period. Twenty-one contracted covid-19 infection, with one hospitalised and no Covid-19 related deaths. In 2020, virtual clinics increased by 88% (video and/or telephone) compared to 2019. RFL well-being initiatives supported all staff.

We aimed to synthesize the prevalence of cognitive deficits after TBI in the acute, subacute, and chronic phases. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses A&I databases were searched from the inception to April 27, 2020. Studies with prospective, retrospective, and cross-sectional designs reporting the prevalence of cognitive deficits after TBI in adults were included. RESULTS: A total of 15 articles were included for prevalence estimation. The pooled prevalence of memory and attention deficits after mild TBI was 31% and 20% in the acute phase and 26% and 18% in the subacute phase, respectively, and 49% and 54% in the subacute phase and 21% and 50% in the chronic phase after moderate-to-severe TBI. The overall prevalence of information processing speed deficits after mild TBI in the acute and subacute phases was 21% and 17%, respectively, and 57% in the chronic phase after moderate-to-severe TBI. The overall prevalence of executive dysfunction in the subacute and chronic phases was 48% and 38%, respectively, after moderate-to-severe TBI. CONCLUSION: Cognitive deficits are prevalent in the acute to chronic phases after TBI. Healthcare providers should design effective intervention targeting cognitive impairment after TBI as early as possible.","Tsai, Ying-Chieh; Liu, Chin-Jung; Huang, Hui-Chuan; Lin, Jiann-Her; Chen, Pin-Yuan; Su, Yu-Kai; Chen, Chun-Ting; Chiu, Hsiao-Yean",The Journal of neuroscience nursing : journal of the American Association of Neuroscience Nurses,https://doi.org/10.1097/jnn.0000000000000570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33538456/,150

Our hypothesis was that this non-adherent layer will lower the dressing's adherence to burn wounds without compromising the antimicrobial activity or increasing the cytotoxicity. A polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel layer was grafted on two commercial silver antimicrobial dressings (silver nanocrystal dressing (NC) and silver plated dressing (SP)) using a proprietary technique. The grafted PAM served as the non-adherent layer. Dressing adherence was measured with a previously published in vitro gelatin model using an Instron mechanical force testing instrument. The dressings were challenged with two clinically retrieved bacterial strains (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa) with both a disk diffusion test, and a suspension antibacterial test. The cytotoxicity of samples to human neonatal fibroblast cells was evaluated with 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Both untreated dressings showed high peeling energy: 2070±453J/m(2) (NC) and 669±68J/m(2) (SP), that decreased to 158±119J/m(2) (NC) and 155±138J/m(2) (SP) with the PAM deposition. Addition of the PAM caused no significant difference in zone of inhibition (ZOI) (disk diffusion test) or antibacterial kinetics (suspension test) against both bacteria (p>0.05, n=6) in either dressing. Survival of fibroblasts was improved by the PAM grafting from 48±5% to 60±3% viable cells in the case of NC and from 55±8% to 61±4% viable cells in SP (p<0.05, n=12). It was concluded that PAM as a non-adherent layer significantly decreases the adherence of these two commercial antimicrobial dressings in an in vitro gelatin model while preserving their antimicrobial efficacy, and reducing their cytotoxicity.","Asghari, Sogol; Logsetty, Sarvesh; Liu, Song",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.burns.2016.01.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26847614/,150

Iran is a country with community transmission of the disease. Telehealth tools have been proved to be useful in controlling public health disasters. We developed an online self-screening platform to offer a population-wide strategy to control the massive influx to medical centers. METHODS We developed a platform operating based on given history by participants, including sex, age, weight, height, location, primary symptoms and signs, and high risk past medical histories. Based on a decision-making algorithm, participants were categorized into four levels of suspected cases, requiring diagnostic tests, supportive care, not suspected cases. We made comparisons with Iran STEPs (STEPwise approach to Surveillance) 2016 study and data from the Statistical Centre of Iran to assess population representativeness of data. Also, we made a comparison with officially confirmed cases to investigate the effectiveness of the platform. A multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression was used to check the association of visiting platform and deaths caused by COVID-19. RESULTS About 310 000 individuals participated in the online self-screening platform in 33 days. The majority of participants were in younger age groups, and males involved more. A significant number of participants were screened not to be suspected or needing supportive care, and only 10.4% of males and 12.0% of females had suspected results of COVID-19. The penetration of the platform was assessed to be acceptable. A correlation coefficient of 0.51 was calculated between suspected results and confirmed cases of the disease, expressing the platform's effectiveness. CONCLUSION Implementation of a proper online self-screening tool can mitigate population panic during wide-spread epidemics and relieve massive influx to medical centers. Also, an evidence-based education platform can help fighting infodemic. Noticeable utilization and verified effectiveness of such platform validate the potency of telehealth tools in controlling epidemics and pandemics.","Azadnajafabad, Sina; Saeedi Moghaddam, Sahar; Rezaei, Negar; Ghasemi, Erfan; Naderimagham, Shohreh; Azmin, Mehrdad; Mohammadi, Esmaeil; Jamshidi, Kosar; Fattahi, Nima; Zokaei, Hossein; Mehregan, Ashkan; Damerchilu, Bahman; Fathi, Pouya; Erfani, Hossein; Norouzinejad, Abbas; Gouya, Mohammad Mehdi; Jamshidi, Hamidreza; Malekzadeh, Reza; Larijani, Bagher; Farzadfar, Farshad",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619926/,150

The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on physical activity or sedentary behaviour in people with Multiple Sclerosis. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in May 2018 of the following databases: Web of Science Core Collections, Embase and Medline. Included studies were randomised controlled trials involving people with Multiple Sclerosis who completed an intervention, compared to any comparator. Outcomes included subjective or objective measures of physical activity or sedentary behaviour. Quality assessment was performed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. RESULTS Twenty-five trials were included covering 1697 participants, the majority of which had mild-moderate disability (average Physiotherapy Evidence Database score 6.2 ± 1.5). Experimental interventions included exercise prescription (n = 5), behaviour change interventions (n = 10), combined exercise, and behaviour change techniques (n = 7) and education (n = 3). Generally, subjective but not objective physical activity improved in those with mild-moderate disability. Insufficient data existed on the effectiveness on sedentary behaviour. CONCLUSIONS A discrepancy seems to exists between the effectiveness of physical activity interventions in people with Multiple Sclerosis depending on whether physical activity was assessed objectively or subjectively, with the latter indicating effects. Effects on sedentary behaviour remain to be elucidated. Implications for Rehabilitation Remaining physically active is important to maintain functional ability, independence, quality of life, and to reduce the incidence of co-morbidity. Exercise prescription, behaviour change interventions, combined exercise and behaviour change interventions, and health promotion education appear to subjectively improve physical activity in people with Multiple Sclerosis with mild-moderate disability, yet this is often not the case when measured objectively.

Due to the treatable nature of many childhood visual disturbances, pediatric vision screening is essential for optimization of health and developmental outcomes. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has inevitably disrupted the provision of routine pediatric health care as evidenced by reduced adherence to vaccination schedules. Further, the home environment, which many children have now become confined to, is known to pose risk for eye trauma which may result in irreversible vision loss. Therefore, it is imperative for pediatricians and pediatric ophthalmologists to focus on eye health and safety, despite the backdrop of a global pandemic.","Camhi, Stephanie S; Shah, Khushali; Cavuoto, Kara M",Journal of binocular vision and ocular motility,https://doi.org/10.1080/2576117x.2020.1830677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33124972/,150
97770,Minimizing the Risk of Aerosol Contamination During Elective Lung Resection Surgery.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND Recanalization rates and patient outcomes in acute occlusion of the carotid terminus have previously been poor. The use of stent-retrievers has resulted in better recanalization and patient outcomes. We sought to compare outcomes in patients treated with stent-retrievers to outcomes in older techniques. METHODS We retrospectively compared a stent-retriever cohort to a historical cohort. We evaluated recanalization rates and good outcomes (defined as mRS < 2 at 30 days or 10 point drop in NIHSS). RESULTS There were twenty patients treated with stent-retrievers versus nine without. The recanalization rate in patients treated with stent retrievers was significantly higher than that of other modalities (90% vs 33%, p=0.004). Good outcomes were significantly higher in the stent retriever cohort (70% vs 22%, p=0.041). CONCLUSION The use of stent-retrievers in patients with carotid ""T"" occlusions shows promise in comparison to older techniques. A randomized trial comparing stent-retriever therapy to IV thrombolysis is warranted to determine the efficacy of this new generation of devices.","Orton, Trent H; Lum, Cheemun; Alhazzaa, Mohammed; Lesiuk, Howard; Dowlatshahi, Dar; dos Santos, Marlise P; Iancu, Daniela",The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

Wounds up to 100 cm2 in size that failed to heal with conventional therapy were included and wound healing, pain, exudate scores, Quality of Life, satisfaction scores, and safety outcomes were evaluated over a period of 26 weeks. Sixteen subjects were enrolled having a mean DFU duration of 60.4 weeks. All ulcers in this study had a positive healing trajectory, with a mean re-epithelialisation of 84.9% and 12.2 cm2 reduction in ulcer area. For ulcers that did not acquire a soft tissue infection post-treatment, all either healed or achieved ≥95% re-epithelialisation including some with exposed tendon. Improvements were observed in all aspects of the health-related Quality of Life questionnaire and subjects and clinicians were highly satisfied across all post-operative visits. This preliminary study suggests ASCS is a well-tolerated and promising therapy for the treatment of DFUs as all ulcers evaluated experienced positive healing results regardless of size, depth, and wound duration. Future studies are warranted to investigate ASCS compared to standard of care for all diabetic foot ulcers, inclusive of the evaluation of treatment algorithms and combination products.

Alterations in neurocognitive functions among patients with metabolic syndrome are important issues in this disorder. In this paper, studies on metabolic syndrome were reviewed and their importance emphasized for the benefit of experts and policy makers. Metabolic syndrome activates inflammatory mediators that disrupt brain metabolism. These mediators can be activated by metabolic inflammation and microvascular disorders and may further cause damage to the white matter and impair cognitive function. These alterations can result in serious changes in cognitive abilities. The association between cognitive changes and metabolic syndrome has been independently evaluated in several studies. In addition, some areas of research in the field of metabolic syndrome include the effectiveness of neurocognitive interventions to enhance normal behaviors or reduce risky behaviors in patients. Structural brain correlates of health-related behaviors provide a basis for designing more effective behavioral interventions by identifying the corresponding brain regions and using behavioral interventions.","Kordestani-Moghadam, Parastou; Assari, Shervin; Nouriyengejeh, Sarah; Mohammadipour, Fatemeh; Pourabbasi, Ata",Journal of obesity & metabolic syndrome,https://doi.org/10.7570/jomes20021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747611/,150

This study aimed to determine if a simplified method of extravascular lung water assessment using ultrasound provided clinically relevant information. METHODS This prospective study recruited 47 patients from a single hemodialysis center. Pulmonary ultrasound was performed before and after 2 hemodialysis sessions in 28 regions on the thorax. The B-line score was defined as the percentage regions where B-lines were present. RESULTS When B-lines were detected before hemodialysis, a significant relationship was found between fluid removal and the change in B-line score. Patients with a B-line score of ≥21.4% (4th quartile) after the second hemodialysis session were more likely to be hospitalized for pulmonary edema or acute coronary syndrome. CONCLUSIONS A simplified pulmonary assessment using ultrasound provides relevant information about pulmonary congestion in hemodialysis patients and identifies patients at risk of hospitalization for heart-related problems.","Beaubien-Souligny, William; Rhéaume, Maxime; Blondin, Marie-Christine; El-Barnachawy, Shérine; Fortier, Annik; Éthier, Jean; Legault, Louis; Denault, André Y",Blood purification,https://doi.org/10.1159/000481768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29216627/,150

This policy received many critics, as Indonesia still experiencing a fluctuated number of infected cases. Understanding public perception through effective risk communication can assist the government in relaying an appropriate message to improve people's compliance and to avoid further disease spread. OBJECTIVE This study observed how risk communication using social media platforms like Twitter could be adopted to measure public attention on COVID-19 related issues ""New Normal"". METHOD From May 21 to June 18, 2020, we archived all tweets related to COVID-19 containing keywords: ""#NewNormal"", and ""New Normal"" using Drone Emprit Academy (DEA) engine. DEA search API collected all requested tweets and described the cumulative tweets for trend analysis, word segmentation, and word frequency. We further analyzed the public perception using sentiment analysis and identified the predominant tweets using emotion analysis. RESULT We collected 284,216 tweets from 137,057 active users. From the trend analysis, we observed three stages of the changing trend of the public's attention on the ""New Normal"". Results from the sentiment analysis indicate that more than half of the population (52%) had a ""positive"" sentiment towards the ""New Normal"" issues while only 41% of them had a ""negative"" perception. Our study also demonstrated the public's sentiment trend has gradually shifted from ""negative"" to ""positive"" due to the influence of both the government actions and the spread of the disease. A more detailed analysis of the emotion analysis showed that the majority of the public emotions (77.6%) relied on the emotion of ""trust"", ""anticipation"", and ""joy"". Meanwhile, people were also surprised (8.62%) that the Indonesian government progressed to the ""New Normal"" concept despite a fluctuating number of cases. CONCLUSION Our findings offer an opportunity for the government to use Twitter in the process of quick decision-making and policy evaluation during uncertain times in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rahmanti, Annisa Ristya; Ningrum, Dina Nur Anggraini; Lazuardi, Lutfan; Yang, Hsuan-Chia; Li, Yu-Chuan Jack",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33906012/,150

METHOD A prospectively registered (center for reviews and dissemination: 42015022067) systematic review searched for experimental and observational studies investigating rigid/thermoplastic upper limb orthotic intervention for children aged 0-18 with CP. The Cochrane central register, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases were searched. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias. RESULTS Sixteen studies met selection criteria. Two studies described a specific reason for orthosis prescription, six prescribed orthoses to manage a clinical symptom and eight did not describe a reason. Eight studies were analyzed for effect according to intended outcome with no clear connection found between reasons for prescription, outcome measures utilized and effect reported. INTERPRETATION The lack of evidence for upper limb orthotic intervention for children with CP leads to uncertainty when considering this treatment modality. Future research is needed to evaluate the effect of orthosis wear in relation to intended outcome utilizing robust methods and valid and reliable outcome measures. Implications for rehabilitation: Insufficient evidence exists about the reason for prescription of upper limb orthoses. The connection between reason for orthosis prescription, intended outcome, outcome measure utilized and observed effect is unclear. Recommend orthosis prescription to be accompanied by clear documentation of the aim of the orthosis and description using orthosis classification system terminology. Outcome measures consistent with the reason for orthosis prescription and intended outcome of the intervention are essential to measure effectiveness of the intervention.","Garbellini, Simon; Robert, Yvette; Randall, Melinda; Elliott, Catherine; Imms, Christine",Disability and rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2017.1297498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28286982/,150

Traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) has both systematism theory knowledge and clinical practical value in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, it was particularly important to examine the effect of TCM in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The patents of TCM might reflect the latest progression of scientific research. We aimed to provide reference for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by extracting and analyzing the TCM patents from the Patent Information Sharing Platform of COVID-19. The antiviral TCM patents were screened and exported from the Patent Information Sharing Platform. VOSviewer 1.6.14 was used to visualize and analyze the network of TCM in these patents. There were total 292 TCM patents, including 52 patents for etiological treatment and 240 patents for symptomatic treatment. Thirty-two provinces and 1 076 inventors were involved, mainly from Beijing, Guangdong and Jiangsu. Overall, there were 356 TCMs, 71 single prescriptions, and 221 compound prescriptions. The patents for treatment of coronavirus mainly focused on the treatment of coronavirus, while the patents for symptomatic treatment mainly focuses on the improvement of respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough. There were 14 highly frequently used TCMs, including Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Scutellariae Radix, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Forsythiae Fructus, Isatidis Radix, Astragali Radix, Menthae Haplocalycis Herba, Gypsum Fibrosum, Houttuyniae Herba, Isatidis Folium, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Gardeniae Fructus, Platycodonis Radix, Armeniacae Semen Amarum.

We set out to evaluate the negative predictive value of these guidelines and to assess a modified algorithm involving minimally invasive surgery in the treatment of women with masses suspected to be benign. METHODS 257 consecutive patients with adnexal masses of 8cm to 13cm on preoperative ultrasound examination meeting Triage Criteria set forth in ACOG Committee Opinion 280. Patients meeting the selection criteria were scheduled for operative laparoscopy, washings, adnexectomy, bagging, and colpotomy. A total of 240 patients successfully completed intended treatment (93.38%), and 234 of these did not require admission (97.5%). There was a low incidence of significant complications: 97.50% of women were successfully treated as outpatients, 97.92% of surgeries lasted <136 minutes, and <97.08% had blood loss <200mL. The negative predictive value of ACOG Committee Opinion 280 Triage Criteria as a deselector for having invasive ovarian malignancy in our population was 95.57% for premenopausal and 90.91% for postmenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic adnexectomy, bagging, and colpotomy is a desirable goal for patients with ovarian masses in the 8cm to 13cm range meeting selection criteria affording a minimally invasive approach with attendant benefits including outpatient treatment (97.5%), few complications, low likelihood of iatrogenic rupture of the ovarian capsule (1.25%), and low necessity for reoperation after final pathology is evaluated (6.03%). Negative predictive value of ACOG Committee Opinion 280 is confirmed in a community gynecology practice and is recommended to form the basis of a new treatment algorithm for women with adnexal masses.","Demir, Richard H; Marchand, Greg J",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680812x13291597716069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22906334/,150

We report a case involving an emergent salvage surgery for a patient with massive hemoptysis who developed lung cancer recurrence after undergoing proton beam therapy 7 years prior to presentation. CASE PRESENTATION A 70-year-old male patient was emergently admitted due to massive hemoptysis. He had undergone proton beam therapy for a stage I adenocarcinoma of the left upper lobe 7 years ago, and was receiving chemotherapy for local recurrence. We performed an emergent salvage pulmonary resection to achieve hemostasis. During the operation, we confirmed the presence of a left broncho-pulmonary arterial fistula, which was considered as the origin of the massive hemoptysis. We repaired the fistula between the pulmonary artery and left upper bronchus without incident; an orifice of the fistula at the left pulmonary artery was sutured using a non-absorbable monofilament, and the central portion of the orifice of the fistula at the left upper bronchus was closed with a mechanical stapling device. The postoperative diagnosis was of an adenocarcinoma-ypT3(pm1) N0M1a (dissemination)-IVA, ef1b. The patient has survived for over a year with the cancer in almost complete remission following the administration of an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS Emergent salvage surgery demands high skill levels with optimal timing and correct patient selection. Our case suggested that the procedure played an important role in controlling serious bleeding and/or infectious conditions. Consequently, he could receive chemotherapy again and survive for over a year.","Hino, Haruaki; Nakahama, Kahori; Ogata, Makoto; Kibata, Kayoko; Miyasaka, Chika; Utsumi, Takahiro; Maru, Natsumi; Matsui, Hiroshi; Taniguchi, Yohei; Saito, Tomohito; Tsuta, Koji; Murakawa, Tomohiro",Surgical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-021-01177-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33877476/,150

100707,Mobilizing animal models against a pandemic.,2020-05-12,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular process by which bulk cytoplasm is enveloped inside a double-membraned vesicle and shuttled to lysosomes for degradation. Within the last 15 years, the genes necessary for the execution of autophagy have been identified and the number of tools for studying this process has grown. Autophagy is essential for tissue homeostasis and development and defective autophagy is associated with a number of diseases. As intracellular parasites, during the course of an infection, viruses encounter autophagy and interact with the proteins that execute this process. Autophagy and/or autophagy genes likely play both anti-viral and pro-viral roles in the life cycles and pathogenesis of many different virus families. With respect to anti-viral roles, the autophagy proteins function in targeting viral components or virions for lysosomal degradation in a process termed xenophagy, and they also play a role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune system responses to viral infections. Consistent with this anti-viral role of host autophagy, some viruses encode virulence factors that interact with the host autophagy machinery and block the execution of autophagy. In contrast, other viruses appear to utilise components of the autophagic machinery to foster their own intracellular growth or non-lytic cellular egress. As the details of the role (s) of autophagy in viral pathogenesis become clearer, new anti-viral therapies could be developed to inhibit the beneficial and enhance the destructive aspects of autophagy on the viral life cycle.","Kudchodkar, Sagar B; Levine, Beth",Reviews in medical virology,https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.630; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19750559/,150

It significantly contributes to error prevention and safety improvement. Yet, some errors in intensive care units are not communicated. OBJECTIVES The aim of the present study was to explore factors affecting error communication in intensive care units. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS This qualitative study was conducted in 2019. Participants were 17 critical care nurses purposively recruited from the intensive care units of 2 public hospitals affiliated to Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews and were analyzed through the conventional content analysis method proposed by Graneheim and Lundman. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The Ethics Committee of Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran approved the study (code: IR.IUMS. REC.1397.792). Participants were informed about the study aim and methods and were ensured of data confidentiality. They were free to withdraw from the study at will. Written informed consent was obtained from all of them. FINDINGS Factors affecting error communication in intensive care units fell into four main categories, namely the culture of error communication (subcategories were error communication organizational atmosphere, clarity of processes and guidelines, managerial support for nurses, and learning organization), the consequences of errors for nurses and nursing (subcategories were fear over being stigmatized as incompetent, fear over punishment, and fear over negative judgments about nursing), the consequences of errors for patients (subcategories were monitoring the effects of errors on patients and predicting the effects of errors on patients), and ethical and professional characteristics (subcategories were ethical characteristics and inter-professional relationships). DISCUSSION The results of this study show many factors affect error communication, some facilitate and some prohibit it. Organizational factors such as the culture of error communication and the consequences of error communication for the nurse and the patient, as well as individual and professional characteristics, including ethical characteristics and interprofessional relationship, influence this process. CONCLUSION Errors confront nurses with ethical challenges and make them assess error consequences and then, communicate or hide them based on the results of their assessments. Health authorities can promote nurses' error communication through creating a supportive environment for them, developing clear error communication processes and guidelines, and providing them with education about the principles of ethical practice.","Ghezeljeh, Tahereh Najafi; Farahani, Mansoureh Ashghali; Ladani, Fatemeh Kafami",Nursing ethics,https://doi.org/10.1177/0969733020952100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985367/,150

METHODS In a retrospective cohort study, medical records of all ELBW infants admitted to our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (2010-2017) were reviewed for infants' demographics, clinical characteristics, nutritional intake during their first week of life, and BPD risk factors. RESULTS During the study period 226 infants were identified of whom 67% (151/226) had moderate-severe BPD and the rest served as controls. Overall infants with moderate-severe BPD were younger, smaller, and spent more time on mechanical ventilation than their controls [(mean±standard deviation) 24.7±1.7 vs. 26.8±2.0 weeks gestational age (p < 0.001); 678±154 vs. 837±129 grams (p < 0.001); and 37.9±23.6 vs. 13.7±15.3 days (p < 0.001) respectively]. During the first week of life, the average caloric, carbohydrate, protein and lipid intakes were significantly lower, and the average fluid intake was significantly higher in the moderate-severe BPD than the control group. After adjustment for confounders, fluid intake, and days on mechanical ventilation were significantly associated with moderate-severe BPD with an odds ratio [OR (95% confidence interval)] of 1.03 (1.01-1.04), and 1.05 (1.03-1.07) respectively. Low caloric intake was associated with an increased risk for moderate-severe BPD [OR: 0.94 (0.91-0.97)]. CONCLUSION Low caloric intake, and high fluid intake during the first week of life are associated with the severity of BPD in ELBW infants.","Al-Jebawi, Y; Argawal, N; Groh Wargo, S; Shekhawat, P; Mhanna, M J",Journal of neonatal-perinatal medicine,https://doi.org/10.3233/npm-190267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31771083/,150

OBJECTIVE To systematically assess the association between neonatal hypoglycaemia on neurodevelopment outcomes in childhood and adolescence. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO from inception until February 2018. We included studies that reported one or more prespecified outcomes and compared children exposed to neonatal hypoglycaemia with children not exposed. Studies of neonates with congenital malformations, inherited metabolic disorders and congenital hyperinsulinism were excluded. Two authors independently extracted data using a customized form. We used ROBINS-I to assess risk of bias, GRADE for quality of evidence, and REVMAN for meta-analysis (inverse variance, fixed effects). RESULTS 1,665 studies were screened, 61 reviewed in full, and 11 included (12 publications). In early childhood, exposure to neonatal hypoglycaemia was not associated with neurodevelopmental impairment (n = 1,657 infants; OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.86-1.57) but was associated with visual-motor impairment (n = 508; OR = 3.46, 95% CI = 1.13-10.57) and executive dysfunction (n = 463; OR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.20-5.22). In mid-childhood, neonatal hypoglycaemia was associated with neurodevelopmental impairment (n = 54; OR = 3.62, 95% CI = 1.05-12.42) and low literacy (n = 1,395; OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.20-3.47) and numeracy (n = 1,395; OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.21-3.44). No data were available for adolescents. CONCLUSIONS Neonatal hypoglycaemia may have important long-lasting adverse effects on neurodevelopment that may become apparent at later ages.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS Between July 2009 and May 2010, 124 patients with gastric cancer underwent TLTG using endoscopic linear staplers in one institution. The clinicopathological data and surgical outcomes of the first 70 cases and the subsequent 54 cases were reviewed retrospectively and compared because technical improvements were instituted after the 70th case. RESULTS The two groups differed significantly in terms of mean operation time (189.0 versus 148.3 minutes, P<.001), overall postoperative complication rate (37.1% versus 13.0%, P=.003), severe postoperative complication rate (15.7% versus 3.7%, P=.030), and intraoperative event rate (12.9% versus 1.9%, P=.042). CONCLUSIONS The early period of performing TLTG using an endoscopic linear stapler was associated with a high morbidity rate. This improved significantly when key technical changes were introduced. However, surgeons who are inexperienced in laparoscopic gastrectomy should be careful when performing TLTG because it involves many complex processes. The account in this report of our experiences with TLTG may help surgeons to master this method faster and more safely.","Kim, Hee Sung; Kim, Min Gyu; Kim, Beom Su; Yook, Jeoung Hwan; Kim, Byung Sik",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

The toxicity test had shown that acetic, propionic and butyric acids tend to stimulate the bacterial density level (survival rate more than 50%), while formic acid, copper, oil and grease were shown to have suppressed the density level (survival rate less than 50%). The highest biomass recorded was 1.66 mg/L for the concentration of acetic acid at 216 mg/L and lowest biomass concentration, 0.90 mg/L for copper at 1.40 mg/L. Biohydrogen-producing bacteria have a favourable growth rate around pH 5.5. The comparison of half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values between two test duration on the effects of organic and inorganic by-products postulate that bacteria had a higher tolerance towards volatile fatty acids. While acetic, butyric and propionic acids had exhibited higher tolerance EC50 values for bacteria, but the opposite trend was observed for formic acid, copper and oil & grease.","Arisht, Shalini Narayanan; Abdul, Peer Mohamed; Jasni, Jannatulhawa; Mohd Yasin, Nazlina Haiza; Lin, Sheng-Kai; Wu, Shu-Yii; Takriff, Mohd Sobri; Jahim, Jamaliah Md",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888602/,150

103402,Thoracic cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: A consensus statement from the Thoracic Domain of the Asian Society for Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) has been considered to be safe and feasible. However, few studies focused on the comparison between the anatomic and nonanatomic LLR. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the perioperative factors and outcomes of the anatomic and nonanatomic LLR, especially the area of liver parenchymal transection and blood loss per unit area. METHODS In this study, surgical and oncological data of patients underwent pure LLR procedures for malignant liver tumor were prospectively collected. Blood loss per unit area of liver parenchymal transection was measured and considered as an important parameter. All procedures were conducted by a single surgeon. RESULTS During nearly 5 years, 84 patients with malignant liver tumor received a pure LLR procedure were included. Among them, 34 patients received anatomic LLR and 50 received nonanatomic LLR, respectively. Patients of the two groups were similar in terms of demographic features and tumor characteristics, despite the tumor size was significantly larger in the anatomic LLR group than that in the nonanatomic LLR group (4.77 ± 2.57 vs. 2.87 ± 2.10 cm, P = 0.001). Patients who underwent anatomic resection had longer operation time (364.09 ± 131.22 vs. 252.00 ± 135.21 min, P < 0.001) but less blood loss per unit area (7.85 ± 7.17 vs. 14.17 ± 10.43 ml/cm 2 , P = 0.018). Nonanatomic LLR was associated with more blood loss when the area of parenchymal transection was equal to the anatomic LLR. No mortality occurred during the hospital stay and 30 days after the operation. Moreover, there was no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications. The disease-free and overall survival rates showed no significant differences between the anatomic LLR and nonanatomic LLR groups. CONCLUSIONS Both anatomic and nonanatomic pure LLR are safe and feasible. Measuring the area of parenchymal transection is a simple and effective method to estimate the outcomes of the liver resection surgery. Blood loss per unit area is an important parameter which is comparable between the anatomic LLR and nonanatomic LLR groups.","Chen, Ya-Xi; Xiu, Dian-Rong; Yuan, Chun-Hui; Jiang, Bin; Ma, Zhao-Lai",Chinese medical journal,https://doi.org/10.4103/0366-6999.172567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26712431/,150

However, little is known about the exact mechanism of this signaling. A recent study from Dr. David C. Rubinsztein's lab showed that ULK1 is activated by AMPK upon glucose starvation, resulting in the phosphorylation of the lipid kinase PIKFYVE on S1548. The activated PIKFYVE consequently enhances the formation of phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PtdIns5P)-containing autophagosomes, and therefore drives autophagy upregulation. The novel discovery of how ULK1 regulates the non-canonical autophagy signaling (PtdIns5P-dependent autophagy), not only expands our knowledge of autophagy, but also sheds light on therapeutic strategies for curing human disorders, where glucose-induced starvation can play an important role.","Yang, Ying; Klionsky, Daniel J",Autophagy,https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2021.1959240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369843/,150

Innovative surgical and anesthesia techniques have allowed for earlier ambulation and physical therapy participation, maximizing the chance that an appropriately selected patient may be discharged within a day of surgery. The choice of anesthesia type is a modifiable factor that has a major impact on both surgical outcomes and discharge readiness. Recent large database studies have provided evidence for improved outcomes, including decreased mortality, with the use of spinal anesthesia. However, few randomized, controlled trials exist and database studies have limitations. Modern general anesthesia techniques, including total intravenous anesthesia and infusions targeted to anesthetic depth, may make some of these differences insignificant, especially when newer regional anesthesia and local infiltration analgesia techniques are incorporated into TJA enhanced recovery protocols. Multimodal analgesia for all TJA patients may also help minimize differences in pain. Perhaps even more important than anesthesia technique is the proper selection of patients likely to meet the necessary milestones for early discharge. In this article, we provide two contrasting viewpoints on the optimal primary anesthetic for outpatient TJA.","Schwenk, Eric S; Johnson, Rebecca L",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2020-101578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32561653/,150

However, the ability to measure and monitor human mobility, health risk and their changing patterns across spatial and temporal scales using traditional data sources has been limited. To facilitate a better understanding of the use of emerging mobile phone technology and data in travel medicine, we reviewed relevant work aiming at measuring human mobility, disease connectivity and health risk in travellers using mobile geopositioning data. KEY FINDINGS Despite some inherent biases of mobile phone data, analysing anonymized positions from mobile users could precisely quantify the dynamical processes associated with contemporary human movements and connectivity of infectious diseases at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Moreover, recent progress in mobile health (mHealth) technology and applications, integrating with mobile positioning data, shows great potential for innovation in travel medicine to monitor and assess real-time health risk for individuals during travel. CONCLUSIONS Mobile phones and mHealth have become a novel and tremendously powerful source of information on measuring human movements and origin-destination-specific risks of infectious and non-infectious health issues. The high penetration rate of mobile phones across the globe provides an unprecedented opportunity to quantify human mobility and accurately estimate the health risks in travellers. Continued efforts are needed to establish the most promising uses of these data and technologies for travel health.","Lai, Shengjie; Farnham, Andrea; Ruktanonchai, Nick W; Tatem, Andrew J",Journal of travel medicine,https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taz019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30869148/,150

Their paper reflects criticisms that have been made of face coverings policies more generally. Method Narrative rebuttal. Results I address charges that my coauthors and I had misapplied the precautionary principle; drawn conclusions that were not supported by empirical research; and failed to take account of potential harms But before that, I remind my critics that the evidence on face coverings goes beyond the contested trials and observational studies they place centre stage. I set out some key findings from basic science, epidemiology, mathematical modelling, case studies, and natural experiments, and use this rich and diverse body of evidence as the backdrop for my rebuttal of their narrowly framed objections. I challenge my critics' apparent assumption that a particular kind of systematic review should be valorised over narrative and real-world evidence, since stories are crucial to both our scientific understanding and our moral imagination. Conclusion I conclude by thanking my academic adversaries for the intellectual sparring match, but exhort them to remember our professional accountability to a society in crisis.

In this systematic review, we report on the current uses of robotics in plastic and reconstructive surgery and looks to future roles for robotics in this arena. Methods A systematic literature search of Medline, EMBASE, and Scopus was performed using appropriate search terms in order to identify all applications of robot-assistance in plastic and reconstructive surgery. All articles were reviewed by two authors and a qualitative synthesis performed of those articles that met the inclusion criteria. The systematic review and results were conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results A total of 7,904 articles were identified for title and abstract review. Sixty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Robotic assistance in plastic and reconstructive surgery is still in its infancy, with areas such as trans-oral robotic surgery and microvascular procedures the dominant areas of interest currently. A number of benefits have been shown over conventional open surgery, such as improved access and greater dexterity; however, these must be balanced against disadvantages such as the lack of haptic feedback and cost implications. Conclusion The feasibility of robotic plastic surgery has been demonstrated in several specific indications.

METHODS Retrospective analysis was performed of patients treated with FD for tandem intracranial aneurysms. RESULTS Twenty female patients with a mean (±SD) age of 60 (±12) years were included. One patient was treated after subarachnoid hemorrhage. In 22 separate procedures, 47 aneurysms, all located in the intracranial internal carotid artery, were treated. In 3 cases, treatment was performed for aneurysm recurrence after previous endovascular treatment. All aneurysms were successfully treated in 1 session. A single stent was used in most (82%) cases, with no adjunctive coiling. There were no intraprocedural complications. Three patients experienced mild, transient neurologic symptoms after the procedure with no long-term neurologic deficits. Follow-up imaging with digital subtraction angiography and/or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography was available in 18/20 (90%) patients at an average (±SD) of 18.8 (±11.2) months. Of 40 aneurysms with follow-up imaging, 34 (85%) were completely occluded. Clinical follow-up, available in 20/20 (100%) patients, showed that 19/20 (95%) achieved a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2. There were no cases of aneurysm rupture after treatment, and no patients required retreatment at last available follow-up. CONCLUSIONS FD appears technically feasible, safe, and effective for treatment of tandem intracranial aneurysms, with potential advantages over traditional endovascular or surgical treatment modalities. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.","John, Seby; Bain, Mark; Cerejo, Russell; Bauer, Andrew; Masaryk, Thomas; Hussain, Muhammad S; Rasmussen, Peter; Toth, Gabor",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2017.07.146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28782689/,150

However, studies are limited on the impact of environmental risk factors on individuals born prematurely with lung disease after they leave the neonatal intensive care unit and are discharged into the home environment. AREAS COVERED In this review we cover current knowledge of environmental exposures that impact outcomes in preterm respiratory disease, including air pollution, infections, and disparities. The limited data do suggest that certain exposures should be avoided and there are potential preventative strategies for other exposures. There is a need for additional research outside of the neonatal intensive care unit that focuses on individual and community-level factors that affect long term outcomes. EXPERT OPINION Preterm respiratory disease can impose a significant burden on infants, children, and young adults born prematurely, but may improve for many individuals over time.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the degree to which the CCI predicts survival in patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA). MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-two (34 men, 48 women) consecutive RFA treatments for medically inoperable NSCLC were performed at our institution from 1/1/2000 to 1/30/2009. With institutional IRB approval and in full HIPAA compliance, the medical records of these patients were examined for data relating to pre-treatment comorbid conditions, and a retrospective analysis was conducted. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk factors for mortality were determined by single-factor comparisons of curves using Wilcoxon-weighted chi-square and multiple Cox regressions. RESULTS The patients ranged in age from 59 to 91 years (mean: 75.5). Eighty-eight percent (72 patients) were tumor stage IA or IB. Patients were followed for a total of five years; three-year overall survival was 50.6%. Hospital mortality was 0%. Gender, stage, histology and CCI score were each associated with significantly impaired survival (p<0.001 in all cases). After covarying for age, tumor stage>IB, squamous histology and gender, multiple Cox regressions showed that an increasing CCI score was significantly associated with an increased risk of death (HR 1.3, 95% CI 25.5, 58.2). CONCLUSIONS The CCI is validated as an important, independent predictor of patient survival, in cases of inoperable NSCLC treated with RFA.","Simon, Tracey G; Beland, Michael D; Machan, Jason T; Dipetrillo, Thomas; Dupuy, Damian E",European journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2012.06.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22835876/,150

To date, there are no studies that compared the disease severity of COVID-19 in SOT recipients with nontransplant patients. METHODS In this case-control study, we compared the outcomes of COVID-19 between SOT recipients and their matched nontransplant controls. The cases were all adult SOT recipients (N=41) from our academic health center who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between 3/10/20 and 5/15/20 using positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV2. The controls(N=121) were matched on age(±5years), race, and admission status (hospital or outpatient). The primary outcome was death and secondary outcomes were severe disease, intubation and renal replacement therapy(RRT). RESULTS Median age of SOT recipients(9-heart, 3-lung, 16-kidney, 8-liver, 5-dual-organ) was 60 years, 80% were male and 67% were Black. Severe disease adjusted risk of death was similar in both the groups(HR=0.84[0.32-2.20]). Severity of COVID-19 and intubation were similar but the RRT use was higher in SOT (OR=5.32[1.26, 22.42]) compared to non-SOT COVID-19 patients. Among SOT recipients, COVID-19-related treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was associated with ten-fold higher hazard of death compared to without HCQ (HR=10.62[1.24-91.09]). CONCLUSIONS Although African-Americans constituted one-tenth of all SOT in our center, they represented two-thirds of COVID-19 cases. Despite high RRT use in SOT recipients, the severe disease and short-term death were similar in both groups. HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 among SOT recipients was associated with high mortality and therefore, its role as a treatment modality requires further scrutiny.","Sharma, Pratima; Chen, Vincent; Fung, Christopher M; Troost, Jonathan P; Patel, Vaiibhav N; Combs, Michael; Norman, Silas; Garg, Puneet; Colvin, Monica; Aaronson, Keith; Sonnenday, Christopher J; Golob, Jonathan L; Somers, Emily C; Doshi, Mona M",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890139/,150
106932,FDA rejects NASH drug.,2020-07-07,"The H196 residue in SIVmac239 Nef is conserved across the majority of HIV and SIV isolates, lies immediately adjacent to the AP-2 (adaptor protein 2) binding di-leucine domain (ExxxLM195), and is critical for several described AP-2 dependent Nef functions, including the downregulation of tetherin (BST-2/CD317), CD4, and others. Surprisingly, many stocks of the closely related SIVmac251 swarm virus harbor a nef allele encoding a Q196. In SIVmac239, this variant is associated with loss of multiple AP-2 dependent functions. Publicly available sequences for SIVmac251 stocks were mined for variants linked to Q196 that might compensate for functional defects associated with this residue. Variants were engineered into the SIVmac239 backbone and in Nef expression plasmids and flow cytometry was used to examine surface tetherin expression in primary CD4 T cells and surface CD4 expression in SupT1 cells engineered to express rhesus CD4. We found that SIVmac251 stocks that encode a Q196 residue in Nef uniformly also encode an upstream R191 residue. We show that R191 restores the ability of Nef to downregulate tetherin in the presence of Q196 and has a similar but less pronounced impact on CD4 expression. However, a published report showed Q196 commonly evolves to H196 in vivo, suggesting a fitness cost. R191 may represent compensatory evolution to restore the ability to downregulate tetherin lost in viruses harboring Q196.","Schouest, Blake; Leslie, George J; Hoxie, James A; Maness, Nicholas J",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764749/,150

Effects can range from mild changes in nutrient intake to a significant decrease in quality of life. Olfactory dysfunction can follow clinical problems such as trauma to the brain and nose. During recent months, in the setting of the current worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, it has become clear that olfaction can also be damaged by viruses that enter the body through the nose. METHODS To learn more about this important clinical problem, we reviewed the current literature about smell sensation and the contextual application of altered olfaction in the setting of COVID-19. Knowledge about this topic, along with other clinical aspects of COVID-19, is expanding quickly. CONCLUSION Nurses perform assessments, assist with implementing treatment interventions, and provide vital education to patients and their families. These interventions help patients with olfactory dysfunction achieve the best possible functional outcome.","Mortimer, Diane Schretzman; Duverneau-Salifu, Moira",The Journal of neuroscience nursing : journal of the American Association of Neuroscience Nurses,https://doi.org/10.1097/jnn.0000000000000586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33782356/,150

While the implications of the concomitant economic downturn for older adults are just beginning to be recognized, past experience suggests that the consequences could be devastating for many. Analyses indicate that more than one out of five Americans aged 65 years or older live in counties where high infection rates and high economic insecurity risks occur simultaneously. These findings highlight the overlap between current infection patterns and subsequent challenges to economic security that are impacting older people. Strategies and supports for getting people back to work must take into account the large segment of older people who rely on earnings well into later life. Social Security serves as the foundation of economic security for older adults across the income continuum, but it is frequently insufficient in and of itself, let alone during a crisis. Recognizing the importance of cost of living in shaping economic security highlights the need for the federal and state governments and municipalities to take older people into account in the economic recovery effort.","Li, Yang; Mutchler, Jan E",Journal of aging & social policy,https://doi.org/10.1080/08959420.2020.1773191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32543304/,150

Aim. To compare total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and desflurane added to a subanaesthetic dose of propofol. Material and Methods. Fifty patients were enrolled in this study. Fentanyl (3-5 mcg/kg/h) was started in both groups. Patients were divided into two groups. The PD group (n = 25) received 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) desflurane anaesthesia in addition to propofol infusion (2-3 mg/kg/h), while P group (n = 25) received propofol infusion (5-6 mg/kg/h) only. Biochemical data, cortisol, and insulin levels were measured preoperatively (T0), after initiation of CPB but before cross-clamping the aorta (T1), after removal of the cross-clamp (T2), and at the 24th postoperative hour (T3). Results. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure levels were significantly higher in PD group than those in P group in T1 and T2 measurements (p ≤ 0.05). CK-MB showed a significant decrease in group P (p ≤ 0.05). When we compared both groups, cortisol levels were significantly higher in PD group than P group (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusion.

A universally accepted classification system predicting surgical risk and outcome is still lacking. OBJECTIVES We report a modern surgical technique specific for planum sphenoidale and tuberculum sellae meningiomas with associated outcome. A new classification system that can guide the surgical approach and may predict surgical risk is proposed. METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of the patients who between 2005 and March 2015 underwent a craniotomy or endoscopic surgery for the resection of meningiomas involving the suprasellar region. Operative nuances of a modified frontotemporal craniotomy and orbital osteotomy technique for meningioma removal and reconstruction are described. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients were found to have tumors arising mainly from the planum sphenoidale or the tuberculum sellae; 25 underwent frontotemporal craniotomy and tumor removal with orbital osteotomy and bilateral optic canal decompression, and 2 patients underwent endonasal transphenoidal resection. The most common presenting symptom was visual disturbance (77%). Vision improved in 90% of those who presented with visual decline, and there was no permanent visual deterioration. Cerebrospinal fluid leak occurred in one of the 25 cranial cases (4%) and in 1 of 2 transphenoidal cases (50%), and in both cases it resolved with treatment. There was no surgical mortality. CONCLUSION An orbitotomy and early decompression of the involved optic canal are important for achieving gross total resection, maximizing visual improvement, and avoiding recurrence. The visual outcomes were excellent. A new classification system that can allow the comparison of different series and approaches and indicate cases that are more suitable for an endoscopic transsphenoidal approach is presented.","Mortazavi, Martin M; Brito da Silva, Harley; Ferreira, Manuel; Barber, Jason K; Pridgeon, James S; Sekhar, Laligam N",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2015.09.043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26409085/,150
109126,Evaluation of six synthetic surgical meshes implanted subcutaneously in a rat model.,2016,"The sexual impact of urinary incontinence in women depends on a host of parameters, including physical, psychological, social and cultural dimensions. Evaluation of the effects of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and lower urinary tract symptoms on sexual function is often biased by their common association with other pelvic floor disorders, such as pelvic organ prolapse, which also affect sexual satisfaction. Indeed, these complexities are reflected in the literature, which shows considerable disparity in sexual functional characteristics in women with incontinence both before and after treatment. This discordance is further emphasized by heterogeneity in study design, quality and analysis. Here, we describe the nature of sexual dysfunction in women with incontinence, including coital incontinence. The various treatments for SUI, which include transvaginal tape surgeries, can also affect sexual function, positively or negatively. Coital incontinence seems to be a good predictor of an improvement in postoperative sexual parameters: its cure, achieved by >90% of women, to a large extent explains the sexual benefits reported in several studies. By contrast, deterioration in sexual function is sometimes reported after surgery, with de novo or worsened dyspareunia being the most common cause. The literature does not contain any convincing arguments for one treatment or another on the basis of sexual functional outcome.","Fatton, Brigitte; de Tayrac, Renaud; Costa, Pierre",Nature reviews.

Myxospores of the parasites were found in the gills of A. lacustris with 13% prevalence of infection. The myxospores were oval and presented as measures (mean ± standard deviation): total length 18.3 ± 2.2 μm, body length 10.4 ± 1.6 μm, body width 4.9 ± 0.9 μm, tail length 7.2 ± 2.5 μm. The polar capsule was 4.8 ± 0.3 μm long and 1.5 ± 0.2 μm wide. The polar tubules, present inside the polar capsules, had 6 to 7 turns. The ultrastructural analysis allowed the observation of the asynchronous development of the myxospores. Phylogenetic analysis showed H. lacustris n. sp. as a sister species of H. chydadea Barassa and Cordeiro 2003 in a subclade formed by species that parasitize the gills of Characiform fish from Brazil.

110515,Targeted gene delivery to the lung.,2009,"Temperature dependence of band gap is one of the most fundamental properties for semiconductors, and has strong influences on many applications. The renormalization of the band gap at finite temperatures is due to the lattice expansion and the phonon-induced atomic vibrations. In this work, we apply the recently-developed electron-phonon renormalization (EPR) method to study the temperature-dependent band gap in some classical covalent (diamond, Si, and SiC) and ionic semiconductors (MgO and NaCl). The contributions from both the lattice expansion and the phonon-induced atomic vibrations at finite temperatures are considered. The results show that the band gapsEgall decrease as temperatureTincreases, consistent with the experiments and other theoretical studies (e.g., from 0 K to 1500 K, the reductions are ~ 0.451 eV for diamond and ~ 1.148 eV for MgO, respectively). The covalent compounds investigated show weaker temperature dependences ofEgs than the ionic compounds, due to the much weaker lattice expansions and therefore low contributions from these. The zero-point motion effect has greater influence on the band gap in semiconductors with light atoms, such as diamond (reduction ~ 0.437 eV), due to larger atomic displacements. By decomposing the EPR effect into respective phonon modes, it is found that the high-frequency optical phonon vibrations dominate the temperature-dependent band gap in both covalent and ionic compounds. Our work provides the fundamental understandings on the temperature-dependent band gaps caused by lattice dynamics.","Zhang, Yiming; Wang, Ziyu; Xi, Jinyang; Yang, Jiong",Journal of physics.

111476,Collective Behavior Induced Highly Sensitive Magneto-Optic Effect in 2D Inorganic Liquid Crystals.,2021-08-09,"Background Publication bias is an over-representation of statistically significant results in the published literature and may exaggerate summary effect estimates in oncology systematic reviews. Omitting non-significant results in systematic reviews may therefore affect clinical decision-making. We investigate ways that systematic reviewers attempted to limit publication bias during the search process as well as the statistical methods used to evaluate it. For a subset of reviews not reporting publication bias evaluations, we carried out our own assessments for publication bias to determine its likelihood among these reviews. Design We examined systematic reviews from the top five highest impact factor oncology journals published between 2007 and 2015. Systematic reviews were screened for eligibility and qualifying reviews (n = 182) were coded for relevant publication bias study characteristics by two authors. A re-analysis of reviews not initially evaluating for publication bias was carried out using Egger's regression, trim-and-fill, and selection models. Results Of the 182 systematic reviews, roughly half carried out a hand search to locate additional studies. Conference abstracts were the most commonly reported form of gray literature, followed by clinical trials registries. Fifty-one reviews reported publication bias evaluations. The most common method was the funnel plot (80%, 41/51) followed by Egger's regression (59%, 30/51) and Begg's test (43%, 22/51). Our publication bias evaluations on non-reporting reviews suggest that the degree of publication bias depends on the method employed. Conclusion Our study shows publication bias assessments are not frequently used in oncology systematic reviews. Furthermore, evidence of publication bias was found in a subset of non-reporting reviews. Systematic reviewers in oncology are encouraged to conduct such analyses when appropriate and to employ more robust methods for both mitigating and evaluating publication bias.","Herrmann, D; Sinnett, P; Holmes, J; Khan, S; Koller, C; Vassar, M",Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdw691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28039176/,150

The behavior of an individual inside the collective is distinctive from its behavior alone, as it follows its neighbors. The introduction of such collective behavior in two-dimensional (2D) materials may offer new degrees of freedom to achieve desired but unattained properties. Here, we report a highly sensitive magneto-optic effect and transmissive magneto-coloration via introduction of collective behavior into magnetic 2D material dispersions. The increase of ionic strength in the dispersion enhances the collective behavior of colloidal particles, giving rise to a magneto-optic Cotton-Mouton coefficient up to 2700 T-2 m-1 which is the highest value obtained so far, being 3 orders of magnitude larger than other known transparent media. We also reveal linear dependence of magneto-coloration on the concentration and hydration ratios of ions. Such linear dependence and the extremely large Cotton-Mouton coefficient cooperatively allow fabrication of giant magneto-birefringent devices for color-centered visual sensing.","Lan, Tianshu; Ding, Baofu; Huang, Ziyang; Bian, Fenggang; Pan, Yikun; Cheng, Hui-Ming; Liu, Bilu",Journal of the American Chemical Society,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c07481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369770/,150

BACKGROUND The incidence of melanoma continues to rise. A proportion will present or recur with lymph node metastases (American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control stage III). To detect distant metastases, CT and/or FDG-PET are available. However, few studies have assessed their value and costs in stage III. METHODS All consecutive patients with melanoma with palpable, proven lymph node metastases (2003-2008) referred for examination with FDG-PET and CT were prospectively included. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, and positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. In economic evaluation, the costs of diagnostic work-up with and without FDG-PET and CT were compared. RESULTS Overall, 253 patients with melanoma were included. FDG-PET showed a higher sensitivity than CT: 86.1% compared with 78.2%. Specificity was higher for CT (93.7%) compared with FDG-PET (93.1%). Overall, FDG-PET showed a higher PPV and NPV. Cost-consequence analysis showed that adding CT (True-Positive upstaging in 61 patients) to diagnostic work-up decreased cost by 5.5%, adding FDG-PET (True-Positive upstaging in 68 patients) increased cost by 7.2%, and adding both (True-Positive upstaging in 78 patients) increased cost by 15.1%. CONCLUSIONS In this study, FDG-PET had higher sensitivity and predictive value, whereas CT had a higher specificity. Adding one of these diagnostic tools improved the staging of stage III patients with less than 10% cost increase. A proposal for stage-specific use of imaging modalities for clinicians caring for patients with melanoma is presented.","Bastiaannet, Esther; Uyl-de Groot, Carin A; Brouwers, Adrienne H; van der Jagt, Eric J; Hoekstra, Otto S; Oyen, Wim; Verzijlbergen, Fred; van Ooijen, Bart; Thompson, John F; Hoekstra, Harald J",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e31824a5742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367443/,150

These include: 'model organisms' chosen for their phylogenetic/aetiological similarities; multivariable statistical models to estimate the strength/direction of (potentially causal) relationships between variables (through 'causal inference'), and the (past/future) value of unmeasured variables (through 'classification/prediction'); and a range of modelling techniques to predict beyond the available data (through 'extrapolation'), compare different hypothetical scenarios (through 'simulation'), and estimate key features of dynamic processes (through 'projection'). Each of these models: address different questions using different techniques; involve assumptions that require careful assessment; and are vulnerable to generic and specific biases that can undermine the validity and interpretation of their findings. It is therefore necessary that the models used: can actually address the questions posed; and have been competently applied. In this regard, it is important to stress that extrapolation, simulation and projection cannot offer accurate predictions of future events when the underlying mechanisms (and the contexts involved) are poorly understood and subject to change. Given the importance of understanding such mechanisms/contexts, and the limited opportunity for experimentation during outbreaks of novel diseases, the use of multivariable statistical models to estimate the strength/direction of potentially causal relationships between two variables (and the biases incurred through their misapplication/misinterpretation) warrant particular attention. Such models must be carefully designed to address: 'selection-collider bias', 'unadjusted confounding bias' and 'inferential mediator adjustment bias' - all of which can introduce effects capable of enhancing, masking or reversing the estimated (true) causal relationship between the two variables examined.1 Selection-collider bias occurs when these two variables independently cause a third (the 'collider'), and when this collider determines/reflects the basis for selection in the analysis. It is likely to affect all incompletely representative samples, although its effects will be most pronounced wherever selection is constrained (e.g. analyses focusing on infected/hospitalised individuals). Unadjusted confounding bias disrupts the estimated (true) causal relationship between two variables when: these share one (or more) common cause(s); and when the effects of these causes have not been adjusted for in the analyses (e.g. whenever confounders are unknown/unmeasured). Inferentially similar biases can occur when: one (or more) variable(s) (or 'mediators') fall on the causal path between the two variables examined (i.e. when such mediators are caused by one of the variables and are causes of the other); and when these mediators are adjusted for in the analysis. Such adjustment is commonplace when: mediators are mistaken for confounders; prediction models are mistakenly repurposed for causal inference; or mediator adjustment is used to estimate direct and indirect causal relationships (in a mistaken attempt at 'mediation analysis'). These three biases are central to ongoing and unresolved epistemological tensions within epidemiology. All have substantive implications for our understanding of COVID-19, and the future application of artificial intelligence to 'data-driven' modelling of similar phenomena. Nonetheless, competently applied and carefully interpreted, multivariable statistical models may yet provide sufficient insight into mechanisms and contexts to permit more accurate projections of future disease outbreaks.","Ellison, George T H",Annals of human biology,https://doi.org/10.1080/03014460.2020.1839132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33228409/,150

Antibodies are clearly critical for control of this deadly disease; however, the specific mechanisms of action of protective antibodies have yet to be defined. In this Perspective we discuss the antibody features that correlate with in vivo protection during infection with Ebola virus, based on the results of a systematic and comprehensive study of antibodies directed against this virus. Although neutralization activity mediated by the Fab domains of the antibody is strongly correlated with protection, recruitment of immune effector functions by the Fc domain has also emerged as a complementary, and sometimes alternative, route to protection. For a subset of antibodies, Fc-mediated clearance and killing of infected cells seems to be the main driver of protection after exposure and mirrors observations in vaccination studies. Continued analysis of antibodies that achieve protection partially or wholly through Fc-mediated functions, the precise functions required, the intersection with specificity and the importance of these functions in different animal models is needed to identify and begin to capitalize on Fc-mediated protection in vaccines and therapeutics alike.","Saphire, Erica Ollmann; Schendel, Sharon L; Gunn, Bronwyn M; Milligan, Jacob C; Alter, Galit",Nature immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-018-0233-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30333617/,150

IPC is now being widely used in stroke units. Here we describe the disability, living circumstances, quality of life, and hospital costs of patients in CLOTS 3. METHODS In CLOTS 3, a parallel group trial in 94 UK hospitals, immobile patients with stroke from days 0 to 3 of admission were assigned with a computer-generated allocation sequence in a 1:1 ratio to IPC or no IPC through a central randomisation system. We followed up patients at about 6 months with postal or telephone questionnaire to assess the secondary endpoints: disability (Oxford Handicap Scale [OHS]), living circumstances, health-related quality of life (EQ5D-3L), and hospital costs (based on use of IPC and length of hospital stay). Patients and carers who completed the postal questionnaires were not masked to treatment allocation, but telephone follow-up in non-responders was masked. All analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN93529999. FINDINGS Between Dec 8, 2008, and Sept 6, 2012, we enrolled 2876 patients, with 1438 in each group. Despite the previously reported reduction in the risk of proximal deep vein thrombosis at 30 days (primary endpoint), there were no significant differences in disability (OHS 0-2 vs 3-6, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0·98, 95% CI 0·80 to 1·19, p=0·83; adjusted ordinal analysis common OR 0·97, 95% CI 0·86 to 1·11), living circumstances (institutional care vs not; adjusted OR 1·11, 95% CI 0·89 to 1·37; p=0·358), or health-related quality of life (median utility value 0·26, IQR -0·07 to 0·66 with IPC, and 0·27, -0·06 to 0·64, with no IPC; p=0·952). The estimated cost of IPC was £64·10 per patient (SD 28·3). The direct costs of preventing a deep vein thrombosis and death were £1282 (95% CI 785 to 3077) and £2756 (1346 to not estimable), respectively, with IPC. Hospital costs increased by £451 with IPC compared with no IPC because of a longer stay in hospital (mean 44·5 days [SD 37·6] vs 42·8 days [37·2]; mean difference 1·8 days, 95% CI -1·0 to 4·5). By 6 months, despite an increase in survival (IPC 152·5 days [SD 60·6] vs no IPC 148·1 days [64·3]; mean difference 4·5 days, 95% CI -0·2 to 9·1), there was a non-significant increase in quality-adjusted survival associated with IPC (IPC 27·6 days [SD 40·6] vs no IPC 26·7 days [39·6]; mean difference 0·9 days, 95% CI -2·1 to 3·9). INTERPRETATION IPC is inexpensive, prevents deep vein thrombosis, improves survival but not functional outcomes, and does not lead to a significant gain in quality-adjusted survival. When deciding whether to treat patients with IPC, clinicians need to take into account all these potential effects.

VRK-1, the single Caenorhabditis elegans VRK ortholog, functions in cell division and germline proliferation. However, the role of VRK-1 in postmitotic cells and adult life span remains unknown. Here, we show that VRK-1 increases organismal longevity by activating the cellular energy sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), via direct phosphorylation. We found that overexpression of vrk-1 in the soma of adult C. elegans increased life span and, conversely, inhibition of vrk-1 decreased life span. In addition, vrk-1 was required for longevity conferred by mutations that inhibit C. elegans mitochondrial respiration, which requires AMPK. VRK-1 directly phosphorylated and up-regulated AMPK in both C. elegans and cultured human cells. Thus, our data show that the somatic nuclear kinase, VRK-1, promotes longevity through AMPK activation, and this function appears to be conserved between C. elegans and humans.","Park, Sangsoon; Artan, Murat; Han, Seung Hyun; Park, Hae-Eun H; Jung, Yoonji; Hwang, Ara B; Shin, Won Sik; Kim, Kyong-Tai; Lee, Seung-Jae V",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaw7824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937443/,150

However, in some cases, it causes severe disease, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Development of severe RSV infection is determined by the host response. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to identify biomarkers associated with severe RSV infection. To identify biomarkers, nasopharyngeal gene expression was profiled by microarray studies, resulting in the selection of five genes: ubiquitin D, tetraspanin 8, mucin 13, β-microseminoprotein and chemokine ligand 7. These genes were validated by real-time quantitative PCR in an independent validation cohort, which confirmed significant differences in gene expression between mildly and severely infected and between recovery and acute patients. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples are regularly taken when a viral respiratory tract infection is suspected. In this article, we describe a method to discriminate between mild and severe RSV infection based on differential host gene expression. The combination of pathogen detection and host gene expression analysis in nasopharyngeal aspirates will significantly improve the diagnosis and prognosis of respiratory tract infections.","van den Kieboom, Corné H; Ahout, Inge M L; Zomer, Aldert; Brand, Kim H; de Groot, Ronald; Ferwerda, Gerben; de Jonge, Marien I",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00085614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25261323/,150

Existing female-specific literature highlights breast asymmetry and cosmetic reconstruction. We sought to evaluate gender differences in cardiopulmonary function. METHODS Cardiac MRIs, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) were reviewed in 345 patients undergoing preoperative evaluation for PE. Regression modeling was used to evaluate associations between gender and clinical endpoints of cardiopulmonary function. RESULTS Mean age was 15.2 years, 19% were female, 98% were white. Pectus indices included median Haller Index (HI) of 4.8, mean depression index (DI) of 0.63, correction index (CI) of 33.6%, and Cardiac Compression Index (CCI) of 2.79. Cardiac assessment revealed decreased right and left ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF, LVEF) in 16% and 22% of patients, respectively. PFTs and CPETs were abnormal in ~ 30% of patients. While females had deeper PE deformities-represented by higher pectus indices-they had superior function with higher RVEF, LVEF Z-scores, FEV1, VO2 max, O2 pulse, work, and breathing reserve (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Despite worse PE deformity and symptomatology, females had a better cardiopulmonary function and exercise tolerance than males. Further research is needed to assess the precise mechanisms of this phenomenon and postoperative outcomes in this population.","Casar Berazaluce, Alejandra M; Jenkins, Todd M; Garrison, Aaron P; Hardie, William D; Foster, Karla E; Alsaied, Tarek; Tretter, Justin; Moore, Ryan A; Fleck, Robert J; Garcia, Victor F; Brown, Rebeccah L",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-020-04738-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940825/,150

METHODS A total of 39 coagulations were created using a 200-W generator and clustered electrodes or Octopus electrodes during laparotomy in 19 pigs. Radiofrequency was applied to the livers using four protocols: (1) Group A-1, monopolar mode using a clustered electrode (n=11); (2) Group A-2, monopolar mode using an Octopus electrode (n=11); (3) Group B-1, consecutive monopolar mode using three, clustered electrodes (n=8); and (4) Group B-2, switching monopolar mode using two Octopus electrodes (n=9). The energy efficiency, shape, diameters (D) and volume (V) of the coagulation volume were compared in each of the two groups. RESULTS The mean maximum D and V of the coagulations in Group A-2 (4.7 cm and 33.1 cm(3), respectively) were significantly larger than those in Group A-1 (4.1 cm and 20.3 cm(3), respectively) (p<0.05). Furthermore, the mean minimum D, maximum D and V of the coagulations in Group B-2 were significantly larger than those in Group B-1, i.e. 5.3 vs 4.0 cm, 6.6 vs 4.9 cm and 66.9 vs 30.2 cm(3), respectively (p<0.05). The energy efficiencies were also significantly higher in Groups A-2 and B-2 than in Groups A-1 and B-1 (p<0.05). CONCLUSION The Octopus electrodes were more efficient for creating a large ablation zone than clustered electrodes, and the efficacy of RFA with Octopus electrodes can be amplified in the switching monopolar mode.","Lee, E S; Lee, J M; Kim, W S; Choi, S H; Joo, I; Kim, M; Yoo, D H; Yoo, R-E; Han, J K; Choi, B I",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr/61619687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22422385/,150

We assess the safety and the efficacy of a systematic endovascular approach in nonselected patients with MCA aneurysms and determine predictors of treatment outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed data collected between January 2007 and January 2012 in a prospective clinical registry. All patients with MCA aneurysms treated by means of the endovascular approach were included. A multivariate analysis was conducted to identify predictors of complications, recanalization, and outcome. RESULTS A total of 120 patients with 131 MCA aneurysms were included. Seventy-nine patients (65.8%) were treated electively and 41 (34.2%) in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Thirty-three of 131 aneurysms (25.2%) were treated with simple coiling, 79 aneurysms (60.3%) with balloon-assisted coiling, and 19 aneurysms (14.5%) with stent-assisted coiling. Complications occurred in 13.7% of patients. Stent-assisted coiling was significantly associated with more complications (P = .002; OR: 4.86; 95% CI, 1.60-14.72). At 1 month after treatment, both the permanent morbidity (mRS ≤2) and mortality rates were 3.3%, without any significant difference according to the endovascular techniques. Mean angiographic follow-up was 16.3 months. The rate of recanalization was 15.6% without a statistical difference, according to the technique. Larger aneurysms were a predictor of recanalization (P = .016; OR: 1.183; 95% CI, 1.02-1.36). Retreatment was performed in 10 of 131 aneurysms (7.6%). CONCLUSIONS Even though stent-assisted coiling significantly increases the risk of procedural complications, endovascular treatment of MCA aneurysms is safe, effective, and provides durable aneurysm closure in nonselected patients.","Gory, B; Rouchaud, A; Saleme, S; Dalmay, F; Riva, R; Caire, F; Mounayer, C",AJNR.

115736,Multimodality imaging assessment for Thoraflex hybrid total arch replacement.,2016,"BACKGROUND Echocardiography is a valuable noninvasive technique to estimate cardiac output (CO) from the left ventricle (LV) not only in clinical practice but also in small-animal experiments. CO is used to grade cardiac function and is especially important when investigating cardiac injury (e.g., myocardial infarction [MI]). Critically, MI deforms the LV, invalidating the assumptions fundamental to calculating of cardiac volumes directly from the LV. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if Doppler-derived blood flow through the pulmonary trunk (pulmonary flow [PF]) was an improved method over conventional LV-dependent echocardiography to accurately determine CO after MI. METHODS Variations in CO were induced either by transverse aortic constriction or MI. Echocardiography was performed in healthy (n = 27), transverse aortic constriction (n = 25), and MI (n = 41) mice. CO calculated from PF (pulsed-wave Doppler) was internally compared with CO calculated from left ventricular images using M-mode (Teichholz formula) and the single-plane ellipsoid two-dimensional (2D) formula and externally compared with the gold standard, flow probe CO. RESULTS In healthy mice, all three echocardiographic methods (M-mode, 2D, and PF) correlated well with flow probe-derived CO. In MI mice, only PF CO values correlated well with flow probe values. Bland-Altman analysis confirmed that PF was improved over M-mode and 2D echocardiography. Inter- and intrauser variability of PF CO was reduced, and both inter- and intraclass correlation coefficients were improved compared with either M-mode or 2D CO calculations. CONCLUSIONS PF CO calculated from pulsed-wave Doppler through the pulmonary trunk was an improved method of estimating CO over LV-dependent formulas after MI.","Platt, Mathew J; Huber, Jason S; Brunt, Keith R; Simpson, Jeremy A",Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography : official publication of the American Society of Echocardiography,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.echo.2017.02.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28528655/,150

The purpose of this retrospective, cross-sectional study was to describe and compare the CT features of pathologically confirmed lipomas, infiltrative lipomas, and liposarcomas in a sample of canine and feline patients. A total of 50 animals (46 dogs, four cats) and a total of 60 lesions (23 lipomas, 20 infiltrative lipomas, and 17 liposarcomas) were included in the study. Lipomas appeared as round to oval-shaped (n = 21), well-marginated (n = 20) fat-attenuating lesions. Infiltrative lipomas appeared as homogeneous, fat-attenuating masses but, unlike lipomas, they were most commonly characterized by an irregular shape (75%; P < 0.001), and linear components, hyperattenuating relative to the surrounding fat (100%; P < 0.05). Liposarcomas were represented exclusively by heterogeneous lesions with soft tissue attenuating components with a multinodular appearance (76.5%; P < 0.05). Regional lymphadenopathy (n = 10) and amorphous mineralization (n = 4) were also observed in association with liposarcomas. Computed tomography can provide useful information regarding disease location, extent, and involvement of the adjacent structures. Tumor definition and shape were the most useful parameters to differentiate between lipomas and infiltrative lipomas. The presence of a heterogeneous mass, with a multinodular soft tissue component and associated regional lymphadenopathy and mineralization, were features favoring a diagnosis of liposarcoma.","Spoldi, Elisa; Schwarz, Tobias; Sabattini, Silvia; Vignoli, Massimo; Cancedda, Simona; Rossi, Federica",Veterinary radiology & ultrasound : the official journal of the American College of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/vru.12445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27804181/,150

The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked to another case. The ratio of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.1%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (6.9%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (5.1%) and the United Kingdom (13.7%). The lower CFR in Australia is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases. High case ascertainment and prompt identification of contacts enables an effective public health response and a reduction of disease transmission. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained.

Impaired pancreatic function may also result in increased gastric acidity, leading in turn to heartburn, peptic ulcers and the impairment of oral pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The administration of gastric acid-reducing agents has been used as an adjunct to pancreatic enzyme therapy to improve absorption of fat and gastro-intestinal symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. It is important to establish the evidence regarding potential benefits of drugs that reduce gastric acidity in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES To assess the effect of drug therapies for reducing gastric acidity for: nutritional status; symptoms associated with increased gastric acidity; fat absorption; lung function; quality of life and survival; and to determine if any adverse effects are associated with their use. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic and non-electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, abstract books and conference proceedings. Both authors double checked the reference lists of the searches Most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 26 April 2021.

MAIN RESULTS The searches identified 40 trials; 17 of these, with 273 participants, were suitable for inclusion, but the number of trials assessing each of the different agents was small. Seven trials were limited to children and four trials enrolled only adults. Meta-analysis was not performed, 14 trials were of a cross-over design and we did not have the appropriate information to conduct comprehensive meta-analyses. All the trials were run in single centres and duration ranged from five days to six months. The included trials were generally not reported adequately enough to allow judgements on risk of bias. However, one trial found that drug therapies that reduce gastric acidity improved gastro-intestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain; seven trials reported significant improvement in measures of fat malabsorption; and two trials reported no significant improvement in nutritional status. Only one trial reported measures of respiratory function and one trial reported an adverse effect with prostaglandin E2 analogue misoprostol. No trials have been identified assessing the effectiveness of these agents in improving quality of life, the complications of increased gastric acidity, or survival. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Trials have shown limited evidence that agents that reduce gastric acidity are associated with improvement in gastro-intestinal symptoms and fat absorption. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether there is an improvement in nutritional status, lung function, quality of life, or survival. Furthermore, due to the unclear risks of bias in the included trials, we are unable to make firm conclusions based on the evidence reported therein. We therefore recommend that large, multicentre, randomised controlled clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate these interventions.","Ng, Sze May; Moore, Helen S",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd003424.pub5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33905540/,150
117387,Near-infrared NIR irradiation and sodium hypochlorite: An efficacious association to counteract the Enterococcus faecalis biofilm in endodontic infections.,2020-08-08,"Acute cycling exercise can modulate motor cortical circuitry in the non-exercised upper-limb. Within the primary motor cortex, measures of intracortical inhibition are reduced and intracortical facilitation is enhanced following acute exercise. Further, acute cycling exercise decreases interhemispheric inhibition between the motor cortices and lowers cerebellar-to-motor cortex inhibition. Yet, investigations into the effects of acute exercise on sensorimotor integration, referring to the transfer of incoming afferent information from the primary somatosensory cortex to motor cortex, are lacking. The current work addresses this gap in knowledge with two experimental sessions. In the first session, we tested the exercise-induced changes in somatosensory and motor excitability by assessing somatosensory (SEP) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs). In the second session, we explored the effects of acute cycling exercise on short- (SAI) and long-latency afferent inhibition (LAI), and afferent facilitation. In both experimental sessions, neurophysiological measures were obtained from the non-exercised upper-limb muscle, tested at two time-points pre-exercise separated by a 25-min period of rest. Next, a 25-minute bout of moderate-intensity lower-limb cycling was performed with measures assessed at two time-points post-exercise. Acute lower-limb cycling increased LAI, without modulation of SAI or afferent facilitation. Further, there were no exercise-induced changes to SEP or MEP amplitudes. Together, these results suggest that acute exercise has unique effects on sensorimotor integration, which are not accompanied by concurrent changes in somatosensory or motor cortical excitability.","Brown, K E; Neva, J L; Mang, C S; Chau, B; Chiu, L K; Francisco, B A; Staines, W R; Boyd, L A",The European journal of neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.14909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32692429/,150

All compounds adsorb at the solid/liquid interface on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and are investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with submolecular resolution. The observed two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular nanopatterns depend only on the sizes and alkoxy periphery of the cyclophanes and are independent of the specific structures of the intraannular bridges. Since the central arylene moieties of the smaller species are oriented perpendicular to the planes of the bicyclophanes, their substituents protrude from the surface by up to 1.6 nm after adsorption.

Methods: Five electronic databases (MEDLINE 1946-2020, EMBASE 1947-2020, CINAHL 1937-2020, PEDro 1999-2020, and Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials 1991-2020) were systematically searched (until August 2020) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effects of prehabilitation interventions in patients undergoing abdominal cancer surgery. This review included any form of prehabilitation either unimodal or multimodal that included whole body and/or respiratory exercises as a stand-alone intervention or in addition to other prehabilitation interventions (such as nutrition and psychology) compared to standard care. Results: Twenty-two studies were included in the systematic review and 21 studies in the meta-analysis. There was moderate quality of evidence that multimodal prehabilitation improves pre-operative functional capacity as measured by 6 min walk distance (Mean difference [MD] 33.09 metres, 95% CI 17.69-48.50; p = <0.01) but improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness such as preoperative oxygen consumption at peak exercise (VO2 peak; MD 1.74 mL/kg/min, 95% CI -0.03-3.50; p = 0.05) and anaerobic threshold (AT; MD 1.21 mL/kg/min, 95% CI -0.34-2.76; p = 0.13) were not significant. A reduction in hospital length of stay (MD 3.68 days, 95% CI 0.92-6.44; p = 0.009) was observed but no effect was observed for postoperative complications (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.55-1.18; p = 0.27), pulmonary complications (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.28-1.01; p = 0.05), hospital re-admission (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.61-1.90; p = 0.81) or postoperative mortality (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.43-2.09, p = 0.90). Conclusion: Multimodal prehabilitation improves preoperative functional capacity with reduction in hospital length of stay. This supports the need for ongoing research on innovative cost-effective prehabilitation approaches, research within large multicentre studies to verify this effect and to explore implementation strategies within clinical practise.","Waterland, Jamie L; McCourt, Orla; Edbrooke, Lara; Granger, Catherine L; Ismail, Hilmy; Riedel, Bernhard; Denehy, Linda",Frontiers in surgery,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2021.628848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33816546/,150
118427,Methods Used and Application of the Mouse Grimace Scale in Biomedical Research 10 Years on: A Scoping Review.,2021-03-03,"BACKGROUND Tinea capitis is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by dermatophytes. In Central Europe it is mainly caused by zoophilic dermatophytes, as for example Microsporum (M.) canis or Trichophyton (T.) mentagrophytes, and increasingly by anthropophilic fungi. T. tonsurans was commonly related to the Tinea gladiatorum, where transmission occurred between infected persons or via contaminated floors. OBJECTIVE Reporting the transmission of this highly contagious dermatophyte for the first time via beard shaving and hairdressing in barber shops in Germany. PATIENTS AND METHODS 18 young male patients developed tinea capitis and/or barbae shortly after shavings of the beard and/or hair in a barber shop. Native, cultural and molecular diagnostics as well as tissue biopsies and resistance tests were performed of skin and hair samples. RESULTS In all samples T. tonsurans could be identified. The medical history and the clinical picture suggest a transmission through contaminated hairdressing tools. The patients were treated with terbinafine or itraconazole in combination with or exclusively with topical antimycotics. CONCLUSION The transmission and a resulting increase in the incidence of infections with T. tonsurans may be due to shavings with direct skin contact of insufficiently disinfected hairdressing tools. This path of infection has already been observed in Africa and is now being described for the first time in Germany. Knowledge of the pathogen and its transmission ways are essential to interrupt the chain of infection.","Müller, Valentina Laura; Kappa-Markovi, Korina; Hyun, Julia; Georgas, Dimitrios; Silberfarb, Gabriel; Paasch, Uwe; Uhrlaß, Silke; Nenoff, Pietro; Schaller, Jörg",Mycoses,https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.13231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33341968/,150

In developed countries a physician-staffed helicopter emergency medical service (PS-HEMS) is used in addition to ground emergency medical service (GEMS), but the effect is debated. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effect of PS-HEMS compared to GEMS on patient outcomes based on the published scientific literature. METHODS Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched on November 15, 2019 for prospective, interventional studies comparing outcomes of patients transported by either PS-HEMS or GEMS. Outcomes of interest were mortality, time to hospital, and quality of life. RESULTS The majority of 18 studies included were observational and difficult to summarise because of heterogeneity. Meta-analysis could not be carried out. Three studies found reduced mortality in patients transported by PS-HEMS compared with GEMS with Odds ratios (OR) of 0.68 (0.47-0.98); 0.29 (0.10-0.82); and 0.21 (0.06-0.73), respectively. Another two studies found improved survival with OR 1.2 (1.0-1.5) and 6.9 (1.48-32.5) in patients transported by PS-HEMS compared with GEMS. In three studies, PS-HEMS was associated with shorter time to hospital. Three studies reported quality of life and found no benefit of PS-HEMS. CONCLUSION In this systematic review the studies comparing PS-HEMS with GEMS were difficult to summarise because of heterogeneity. We found a possible survival benefit of PS-HEMS but were unable to conduct a meta-analysis. The overall quality of evidence was low.","Risgaard, Bjarke; Draegert, Christina; Baekgaard, Josefine S; Steinmetz, Jacob; Rasmussen, Lars S",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13547; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31950487/,150

However, the efficacy in bipolar depression is less clear. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of ketamine for bipolar depression. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of experimental studies using ketamine for the treatment of bipolar depression. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register for relevant studies published since database inception. We synthesized evidence regarding efficacy (improvement in depression rating scores) and tolerability (adverse events, dissociation, dropouts) across studies. FINDINGS We identified six studies, with 135 participants (53% female, 44.7 years, SD 11.7 years). All studies used 0.5 mg/kg of add-on intravenous racemic ketamine, with the number of doses ranging from one to six; all participants continued a mood-stabilizing agent. The overall proportion achieving a response (defined as those having a reduction in their baseline depression severity of at least 50%) was 61% for those receiving ketamine and 5% for those receiving a placebo. The overall response rates varied from 52% to 80% across studies. Ketamine was reasonably well-tolerated; however, two participants (one receiving ketamine and one receiving placebo) developed manic symptoms. Some participants developed significant dissociative symptoms at the 40-minute mark following ketamine infusion in two trials. CONCLUSIONS There is some preliminary evidence for intravenous racemic ketamine to treat adults with bipolar depression. There is a need for additional studies exploring longer-term outcomes and alterative formulations of ketamine.","Bahji, Anees; Zarate, Carlos A; Vazquez, Gustavo H",The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1093/ijnp/pyab023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33929489/,150
119583,The nanomedicine rush: New strategies for unmet medical needs based on innovative nano DDS.,2020-12-20,"Heart failure is a life-threatening disease prevalent worldwide. Cardiac transplantation is the last resort for patients with severe heart failure, but donor shortages represent a critical issue. Cardiac regenerative therapy is beneficial, but it is currently unsuitable as a substitute for cardiac transplantation. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are excellent sources for the generation of terminally differentiated cells. The preparation of a large number of pure cardiomyocytes (CMs) is the major premise for translational studies. To control the quality of the generated CMs, an efficient differentiation method, purification strategy, and mass-scale culture must be developed. Metabolic purification and large-scale culture systems have been established, and pure hiPSC-derived CMs of clinical grade are now available for translational research. The most critical challenge in cell therapy is the engraftment of transplanted cells. To overcome the low engraftment ratio of single CMs, aggregations of CMs are developed as cardiac spheroids. A cardiac transplantation device with domed tips and lateral holes has been developed for the transplantation of cardiac spheroids. Large animal models are necessary as the next step in the process toward clinical application. The transplant device has successfully been used to inject cardiac spheroids uniformly into myocardial layers in swine, and this approach is progressing toward clinical use. Remaining issues include immunological rejection and arrhythmia, which will require further investigation to establish safe and effective transplantation. This review summarizes the present status and future challenges of cardiac regenerative therapies.","Fujita, Jun",The Keio journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.2302/kjm.2020-0009-ir; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830153/,150
119711,Are open-source approaches the most efficient way forward for COVID-19 drug discovery?,2020-09-11,"The influence of erbium ion concentration on the optical properties of BaF2:ErF3 crystals was investigated. Four ErF3 concentration (0.05, 0.08, 0.15 and 0.5 mol% ErF3)-doped BaF2 crystals were obtained using the Bridgman technique. Room temperature optical absorption in the 250-850 nm spectral range was measured, and the photoluminescence (PL) and decay times were also investigated. The Judd-Ofelt (JO) approximation was used, taking into account four absorption peaks (at 377, 519, 653 and 802 nm). The JO intensity parameters, Ωt (t = 2, 4, 6), were calculated. The influence of the ErF3 concentration on the JO parameters, branching ratio, radiative transition probability and radiative lifetime were studied. The obtained results were compared with measured values and with those reported in the literature. Under excitation at 380 nm, the well-known green (539 nm) and red (668 nm) emissions were obtained. The calculated and experimental radiative lifetimes were in millisecond range for green and red emissions. The intensity of the PL spectra varied with the Er3+ ion concentration. The emission intensity increased linearly or exponentially, depending on the ErF3 concentration. Under excitation at 290 nm, separate to the green and red emissions, a new UV emission band (at 321 nm) was obtained. Other research has not reported the UV emission or the influence of ErF3 concentration on emission behavior.","Racu, Andrei; Stef, Marius; Buse, Gabriel; Nicoara, Irina; Vizman, Daniel",Materials,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14154221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34361413/,150

It is demonstrated that the present model system exhibits phase transitions, or crossovers, among ice VII and two plastic ices with face-centered cubic (fcc) and body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice structures. The phase diagram derived from the ReaxFF potential is different from those of the rigid water models in that the bcc plastic phase lies on the high-pressure side of ice VII and does the fcc plastic phase on the low-pressure side of ice VII. The phase boundary between the fcc and bcc plastic phases on the pressure, temperature plane extends to the high-temperature region from the triple point of ice VII, fcc plastic, and bcc plastic phases. Proton hopping, i.e., delocalization of a proton, along between two neighboring oxygen atoms in dense ice is observed for the ReaxFF potential but only at pressures and temperatures both much higher than those at which ice VII-plastic ice transitions are observed.","Adachi, Yuji; Koga, Kenichiro",The Journal of chemical physics,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0016565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962394/,150

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support gas exchange in patients failing conventional mechanical ventilation, but its role is still controversial. We performed a rapid systematic review focusing on the use of ECMO in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Embase, the Cochrane Library, EBSCO and Ovid (updated 30 April 2020) were systematically searched. Case reports/Case series from COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO were included in the study. Three reviewers assessed, selected, and abstracted data from studies. All disparate opinions were resolved through discussion. RESULTS We included 13 articles for systematic evaluation, including 10 case reports and 3 case series studies, with a total of 72 patients. We search for the following information: First author of articles; Patient's location; age; gender; body mass index (BMI); Comorbidities; Time on ECMO; Mode of ECMO; treatments and clinical outcomes. As of all reporting times, our data show that 38 patients (52.8%) have died definitively, 13 patients (18.0%) were still receiving ECMO treatment, 12 patients (16.7%) were alive, 7 patients (9.7%) were recovery and 2 cases (2.8%) remained hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS ECMO plays an important role in the stabilization and survival critically ill patients with COVID-19, but the usefulness of ECMO in reducing the mortality of severe ARDS caused by COVID-19 was limited. Therefore, a larger sample size study and a comprehensive analysis of evaluating the medical value of using ECMO on COVID-19 patients are urgently required.","Hu, B-S; -Z Hu, M; Jiang, L-X; Yu, J; Chang, Y; Cao, Y; Dai, Z-P",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202011_23855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275268/,150

There is no FDA-approved agent available to manage CIT. AREAS COVERED This article covers the diagnosis, definitions, and clinical challenges of CIT, and then focuses on the therapeutics developed to manage CIT. The first-generation thrombopoietic agents (oprelvekin and recombinant human thrombopoietins) are reviewed for critical background and context, followed by a detailed discussion of the data for the thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) to manage CIT. Efficacy of TPO-RAs in treatment and prevention of CIT, as well as safety concerns such as the risk of thromboembolic complications, are reviewed in detail. For this review, a PubMed/MEDLINE literature search was undertaken for relevant articles published from 1995-2021. EXPERT OPINION After over two decades of drug development for CIT, multiple clinical trials and observational studies have found TPO-RAs, in particular romiplostim, to be safe and effective agents to manage patients with CIT, although no agent is yet FDA-approved for this indication. Active management of CIT with TPO-RAs is likely to improve oncologic outcomes, although additional data is needed. Phase 3 trials are ongoing.","Al-Samkari, Hanny; Soff, Gerald A",Expert review of hematology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17474086.2021.1924053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33926362/,150

METHODS A total of 445 patients undergoing surgery for acute type A aortic dissection were analyzed. Evaluation according to risk factors for mortality, neurologic injury, and kidney function was performed. RESULTS Overall 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 82.8 ± 1.8%, 73.6 ± 2.4%, and 59.3 ± 3.9, respectively. Independent preoperative risk factors for mortality were preexisting renal impairment (p = 0.001), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.001), and age (p < 0.001). Perioperative risk factors were prolonged cross-clamp (p < 0.001) and cerebral perfusion time (p = 0.001). Risk factors for renal failure were preexisting renal impairment (p < 0.001), prolonged cross-clamp time (p < 0.001), cerebral perfusion time (p < 0.001), and age (p = 0.022). Risk factors for neurologic injury were cross-clamp time (p = 0.038), cerebral perfusion time (p = 0.007), and age (p = 0.045). CONCLUSION In addition to classic risk factors, survival after type A aortic dissection is affected by preexisting renal impairment. Preexisting renal impairment is predictive of postoperative renal failure. Therefore treatment and prevention strategies for renal failure during the acute and long-term course after acute type A aortic dissection are warranted.","Schoenrath, Felix; Laber, Raffael; Maralushaj, Mergime; Henzi, Deborah; Caliskan, Etem Ibrahim; Seifert, Burkhardt; Bettex, Dominique; Starck, Christoph Thomas; Czerny, Martin; Falk, Volkmar",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0035-1563536; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26334243/,150

Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between length of stay and total hospital cost. RESULTS There were 391 elective colon resections (223 lap/168 open, 15.4 % conversion). There was no difference in median age, gender, or Charlson score. Body mass index was slightly higher for laparoscopic surgery (27.5/25.9 lap/open; p = 0.008), while the American Society of Anesthesiologists score was slightly higher for open surgery. Median operative time was greater for laparoscopic surgery (224/196 min, lap/open; p = 0.001). There was no difference in complication rates (21.6/22.5 % lap/open; p = 0.900), reoperations (5.8/6.5 % lap/open; p = 0.833) or 30-day readmissions (7.6/12.5 % lap/open; p = 0.122). Number of emergency room visits was greater with open surgery (12.6/20.8 % lap/open; p = 0.037). Operative cost was higher for laparoscopic surgery ($4,171.37/3,489.29 lap/open; p = 0.001), while total hospital cost was significantly reduced ($9,600.22/12,721.41 lap/open; p = 0.001). Median length of stay was shorter for laparoscopic surgery (5/7 days lap/open; p = 0.000), and this correlated directly with hospital cost. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic colon surgery is associated with increased operative costs but significantly lower total hospital costs. The cost savings is related, in part, to reduced length of stay with laparoscopic surgery.","Hardy, Krista M; Kwong, Josephine; Pitzul, Kristen B; Vergis, Ashley S; Jackson, Timothy D; Urbach, David R; Okrainec, Allan",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3311-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24258205/,150

METHODS We enrolled in our study 10,744 overweight or obese subjects, 55 years of age or older, with preexisting cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or both to assess the cardiovascular consequences of weight management with and without sibutramine in subjects at high risk for cardiovascular events. All the subjects received sibutramine in addition to participating in a weight-management program during a 6-week, single-blind, lead-in period, after which 9804 subjects underwent random assignment in a double-blind fashion to sibutramine (4906 subjects) or placebo (4898 subjects). The primary end point was the time from randomization to the first occurrence of a primary outcome event (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, or cardiovascular death). RESULTS The mean duration of treatment was 3.4 years. The mean weight loss during the lead-in period was 2.6 kg; after randomization, the subjects in the sibutramine group achieved and maintained further weight reduction (mean, 1.7 kg). The mean blood pressure decreased in both groups, with greater reductions in the placebo group than in the sibutramine group (mean difference, 1.2/1.4 mm Hg). The risk of a primary outcome event was 11.4% in the sibutramine group as compared with 10.0% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.31; P=0.02). The rates of nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke were 4.1% and 2.6% in the sibutramine group and 3.2% and 1.9% in the placebo group, respectively (hazard ratio for nonfatal myocardial infarction, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.57; P=0.02; hazard ratio for nonfatal stroke, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.77; P=0.03). The rates of cardiovascular death and death from any cause were not increased. CONCLUSIONS Subjects with preexisting cardiovascular conditions who were receiving long-term sibutramine treatment had an increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke but not of cardiovascular death or death from any cause.

123668,Peptide Correlation Analysis (PeCorA) Reveals Differential Proteoform Regulation.,2020-12-16,"PURPOSE To investigate the effects of feedback, in the form of a virtual avatar paced at 100% and 102% of baseline performance, on neuromuscular fatigue after a 4-km cycling time trial (TT). We hypothesized that improved cycling performance would occur because of the participants exceeding a previously established critical threshold and experiencing greater neuromuscular fatigue. METHODS After familiarization, 10 well-trained cyclists performed a baseline 4-km TT without feedback (BASE), followed by two 4-km TT where they raced against an avatar (set at 100% accurate [ACC] and 102% deception [DEC] of baseline power output) in a randomized and counterbalanced order. Before and after each TT, neuromuscular fatigue was assessed using maximal isometric voluntary contractions (MVC) of the quadriceps, and supramaximal electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve, during and 2 s after MVCs to assess voluntary activation and potentiated twitch force. Blood lactate was taken pretrials and posttrials and RPE was taken throughout each TT. RESULTS Time trial performance improved after deception of feedback compared with baseline performance (-5.8 s, P = 0.019). Blood lactate increased after DEC compared with BASE (+1.37 mmol·L, P = 0.019). Despite this, there was no difference in any measures of exercise-induced neuromuscular fatigue (P > 0.05). Similarly, RPE was not different between trials. CONCLUSIONS Well-trained male cyclists can improve cycling TT performance when competing against an avatar increased to 102% of a previously established best effort. However, this improvement is not associated with a measurable augmentation of neuromuscular fatigue.","Ansdell, Paul; Thomas, Kevin; Howatson, Glyn; Amann, Markus; Goodall, Stuart",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000001483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29117071/,150

124254,Together at all times: committed to quality.,2021-09-01,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSC) has established itself as a safe method for the management of pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Laparoscopic suturing is a time-consuming intraoperative task during LSC. Self-retaining barbed sutures (SBSs) are known to reduce the operative time in laparoscopic cases. The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SBS during the performance of LSC. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty female patients with symptomatic POP were treated with LSC by an expert surgeon. The preoperative evaluation included the International Continence Society POP-quantification (POP-Q) and the prolapse-specific quality-of-life questionnaire Mesh fixation was performed with SBS anteriorly on the anterior vaginal wall and posteriorly on the levator ani muscle. A 5-mm titanium tacking device was used for promontofixation. The peritoneum was also closed with an SBS. RESULTS Mean patient's age was 63 years (range: 50-79 years). According to POP-Q, system 3 patients (15%) had Stage I, 12 patients (60%) had Stage II, 3 patients (15%) had Stage III, and 2 patients (10%) had Stage IV prolapse. Concomitant hysterectomy was performed in 14 patients, respectively. Mean operative time was 99.75 (range: 65-140) min, mean blood loss was 57.75 (range: 30-120) ml. One patient had a bladder perforation intraoperatively, and three patients developed transient fever postoperatively. One patient had a recurrent cystocele and three patients recurrent rectocele. CONCLUSIONS The current study renders the use of SBS during LSC to be safe and efficient. Further comparative studies would elucidate the impact of the use of SBS in LSC.","Kallidonis, Panagiotis; Al-Aown, Abdulrahman; Vasilas, Marinos; Kyriazis, Iason; Panagopoulos, Vasilis; Fligou, Fotini; Athanasopoulos, Anastasios; Fariborz, Bagheri; Liatsikos, Evangelos; Özsoy, Mehmet",Urology annals,https://doi.org/10.4103/ua.ua_161_16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28479768/,150

Many institutions still use patient-controlled epidural analgesia without a background infusion, and a comparative study between programmed intermittent epidural bolus and patient-controlled epidural analgesia without a background infusion has not yet been performed. We performed a randomised, two-centre, double-blind, controlled trial of these two techniques. The primary outcome was the incidence of breakthrough pain requiring a top-up dose by an anaesthetist. Secondary outcomes included: motor block; pain scores; patient satisfaction; local anaesthetic consumption; and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. We recruited 130 nulliparous women who received initial spinal analgesia, and then epidural analgesia was initiated and maintained with either programmed intermittent epidural bolus or patient-controlled epidural analgesia using ropivacaine 0.12% with sufentanil 0.75 µg·ml-1 . The programmed intermittent epidural bolus group had a programmed bolus of 10 ml every hour, with on-demand patient-controlled epidural analgesia boluses of 5 ml with a 20 min lockout, and the patient-controlled epidural analgesia group had a 5 ml bolus with a 12 min lockout interval; the potential maximum volume per hour was the same in both groups. The patients in the programmed intermittent epidural bolus group had less frequent breakthrough pain compared with the patient-controlled epidural analgesia group, 7 (10.9%) vs. 38 (62.3%; p < 0.0001), respectively. There was a significant difference in motor block (modified Bromage score ≤ 4) frequency between groups, programmed intermittent epidural bolus group 1 (1.6%) vs. patient-controlled epidural analgesia group 8 (13.1%); p = 0.015. The programmed intermittent epidural bolus group had greater local anaesthetic consumption with fewer patient-controlled epidural analgesia boluses. Patient satisfaction scores and obstetric or neonatal outcomes were not different between groups. In conclusion, we found that a programmed intermittent epidural bolus technique using 10 ml programmed boluses and 5 ml patient-controlled epidural analgesia boluses was superior to a patient-controlled epidural analgesia technique using 5 ml boluses and no background infusion.","Roofthooft, E; Barbé, A; Schildermans, J; Cromheecke, S; Devroe, S; Fieuws, S; Rex, S; Wong, C A; Van de Velde, M",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530518/,150
124507,The genomics of emerging pathogens.,2013,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a potentially fatal hyperinflammatory condition. It may occur as a primary (genetic) condition due to mutations in genes important in the cytolytic secretory pathway that cause perforin and granzymes to induce apoptosis in target cells. Primary HLH is divided into familial HLH (FHLH1-5), in which HLH is the only manifestation of disease, and other genetic causes in which HLH is one of several clinical manifestations. The identical clinical findings may arise secondary to infectious, rheumatologic, malignant, or metabolic conditions. Whether primary or secondary, HLH therapy needs to be instituted promptly to prevent irreversible tissue damage. It is helpful to think of HLH as the severe end of the spectrum of hyperinflammatory disorders when the immune system starts to damage host tissues (immunopathology). Therefore, no single clinical feature alone is diagnostic for HLH, and it is important that the entire clinical presentation be considered in making the diagnosis. This article contains a discussion of the genetic background, clinical presentation, diagnostic dilemmas, and features that are helpful in making the diagnosis of HLH, along with a discussion of common problems in its management.","Weitzman, Sheila",Hematology.

125562,Generations of Dedicated Researchers Resulting in Generations of Constant Progress: Pediatric Cardiology.,2020-10-01,"PURPOSE Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production upon reperfusion of ischemic tissue initiates the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury associated with heart attack. During ischemia, succinate accumulates and its oxidation upon reperfusion by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) drives ROS production. Inhibition of succinate accumulation and/or oxidation by dimethyl malonate (DMM), a cell permeable prodrug of the SDH inhibitor malonate, can decrease I/R injury. However, DMM is hydrolysed slowly, requiring administration to the heart prior to ischemia, precluding its administration to patients at the point of reperfusion, for example at the same time as unblocking a coronary artery following a heart attack. To accelerate malonate delivery, here we developed more rapidly hydrolysable malonate esters. METHODS We synthesised a series of malonate esters and assessed their uptake and hydrolysis by isolated mitochondria, C2C12 cells and in mice in vivo. In addition, we assessed protection against cardiac I/R injury by the esters using an in vivo mouse model of acute myocardial infarction. RESULTS We found that the diacetoxymethyl malonate diester (MAM) most rapidly delivered large amounts of malonate to cells in vivo. Furthermore, MAM could inhibit mitochondrial ROS production from succinate oxidation and was protective against I/R injury in vivo when added at reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS The rapidly hydrolysed malonate prodrug MAM can protect against cardiac I/R injury in a clinically relevant mouse model.","Prag, Hiran A; Pala, Laura; Kula-Alwar, Duvaraka; Mulvey, John F; Luping, Du; Beach, Timothy E; Booty, Lee M; Hall, Andrew R; Logan, Angela; Sauchanka, Volha; Caldwell, Stuart T; Robb, Ellen L; James, Andrew M; Xu, Zhelong; Saeb-Parsy, Kourosh; Hartley, Richard C; Murphy, Michael P; Krieg, Thomas",Cardiovascular drugs and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10557-020-07033-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648168/,150
126035,Laparoscopic early pregnancy diagnosis in the laboratory rat.,2018,"The highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) poses a constant threat to human health. The viral spike protein (SARS-S) mediates host cell entry and is a potential target for antiviral intervention. Activation of SARS-S by host cell proteases is essential for SARS-CoV infectivity but remains incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed the role of the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), in SARS-S activation. We found that HAT activates SARS-S in the context of surrogate systems and authentic SARS-CoV infection and is coexpressed with the viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in bronchial epithelial cells and pneumocytes. HAT cleaved SARS-S at R667, as determined by mutagenesis and mass spectrometry, and activated SARS-S for cell-cell fusion in cis and trans, while the related pulmonary protease TMPRSS2 cleaved SARS-S at multiple sites and activated SARS-S only in trans. However, TMPRSS2 but not HAT expression rendered SARS-S-driven virus-cell fusion independent of cathepsin activity, indicating that HAT and TMPRSS2 activate SARS-S differentially. Collectively, our results show that HAT cleaves and activates SARS-S and might support viral spread in patients.","Bertram, Stephanie; Glowacka, Ilona; Müller, Marcel A; Lavender, Hayley; Gnirss, Kerstin; Nehlmeier, Inga; Niemeyer, Daniela; He, Yuxian; Simmons, Graham; Drosten, Christian; Soilleux, Elizabeth J; Jahn, Olaf; Steffen, Imke; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05300-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994442/,150

These are often associated with thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic complications. The type of procedure, perioperative antiplatelet therapy, and other patient-related factors influence the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. Our objective was to analyze the postoperative risk factors for hemorrhagic complications and to determine the impact of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy strategies on postoperative bleeding risk in patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS Prospective, multicentre observational cohort study of 1134 consecutive patients with coronary stents undergoing non-cardiac surgery between April 2007 and April 2009. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an hemorrhagic complication during the first 30days following the surgery or intervention. RESULTS Among the 1134 patients evaluated, 108 (9.5%) experienced a postoperative hemorrhagic complication (with a median time to occurrence of 5.3days). These complications were considered major, involved the operative site, and required reoperation in 92 (85.2%), 92 (85.2%), and 20 (18.5%) of patients, respectively. Mortality in patients with a haemorrhagic complication was 12% (n=13). Independent postoperative factors associated with haemorrhagic complications were identified as a high and intermediate bleeding risk procedure and the use and dose of anticoagulants. When interrupted before the procedure, resumption of antiplatelet treatment was delayed in patients developing early postoperative hemorrhagic complications. CONCLUSION Patients with coronary stents who undergo surgery are at high risk for hemorrhagic complications.","Albaladejo, Pierre; Charbonneau, Hélène; Samama, Charles-Marc; Collet, Jean-Philippe; Marret, Emmanuel; Piriou, Vincent; Genty, Celine; Bosson, Jean Luc",Thrombosis research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2014.05.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24913999/,150
126612,Probiotic bacteria maintain normal growth mechanisms of heat stressed broiler chickens.,2020-08-01,"OBJECTIVES Child and adolescent psychiatric (CAP) inpatient admissions have increased since 2009 and the clinical profile of these patients has become more complex. Unrecognized dual diagnosis, that is, comorbid substance use or substance use disorder (SUD) may contribute to this problem, but the prevalence of dual diagnosis in this population is inadequately understood. The goal of this scoping review was to summarize the range and content of research on this topic. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsychINFO databases were systematically searched for studies published from 2008 to 2019 containing information on rates of comorbid substance use or SUD in CAP inpatients. RESULTS A total of 23,326 abstracts were located. After removing duplicates, screening abstracts and full-text papers, and extracting data with full-text reviews, fourteen studies meeting our criteria remained. Rates of substance use or SUD ranged from 0.9% to 54.8%, differing on the basis of: (1) type of outcome; (2) type of data source; and (3) whether samples had a specific diagnostic focus or not. Rates of any type of SUD were reported in approximately 25% of samples from administrative databases, in 17.7% to 38.5% of chart reviews, and in 55% of studies with data from clinical research examinations. The highest rates of substance-specific substance use or SUD were for alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine. CONCLUSIONS We located 14 studies, but methodologic heterogeneity precluded quantitative calculation of a single estimate for the prevalence of dual diagnosis. However, most of the rates suggest that this is an important problem in CAP inpatients, meriting further research. We suggest ways to improve future studies.","Suntharalingam, Sinthuja; Johnson, Dylan; Suresh, Shalini; Thierrault, François L; De Sante, Stephanie; Perinpanayagam, Pawrnaa; Salamatmanesh, Mina; Pajer, Kathleen",Journal of addiction medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33534276/,150

However, the distinct alterations of molecules involved in the death pathways and drug effects targeting inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) have not been extensively characterized in HPV(+) HNSCC cells. In this study, we observed the distinct genomic and expression alterations of nine genes involved in cell death in 55% HNSCC tissues, which were associated with HPV status, tumor staging, and anatomic locations. Expression of four genes was statistically correlated with copy number variation. A panel of HPV(+) HNSCC lines showed abundant TRAILR2 and IAP1 protein expression, but were not sensitive to IAP inhibitor birinapant alone, while combinatory treatment with TNFα or especially TRAIL enhanced this drug sensitivity. The death agonistic TRAILR2 antibody alone showed no cell inhibitory effects, whereas its combination with birinapant and/or TRAIL protein demonstrated additive or synergistic effects. We observed predominantly late apoptosis mode of cell death after combinatorial treatments, and pan-caspase (ZVAD) and caspase-8 (ZIETD) inhibitors attenuated treatment-induced cell death. Our genomic and expression data-driven study provides a framework for identifying relevant combinatorial therapies targeting death pathways in HPV(+) HNSCC and other squamous cancer types.","An, Yi; Jeon, Jun; Sun, Lillian; Derakhshan, Adeeb; Chen, Jianhong; Carlson, Sophie; Cheng, Hui; Silvin, Christopher; Yang, Xinping; Van Waes, Carter; Chen, Zhong",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85589-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737574/,150

In this case series we evaluate outcome after coronectomy of teeth with associated dentigerous cysts in cases where the inferior dental nerve was thought to be at risk, or there was an increased risk of mandibular fracture. We retrospectively studied 21 consecutive patients treated by coronectomy for dentigerous cysts at the Oral Surgery Department at Guy's Hospital. The most commonly affected teeth were mandibular third molars (20/21). One patient had permanent injury to the inferior dental nerve, but no mandibular fracture or recurrence of cyst was reported. One patient required secondary retrieval of the retained root because of eruption. Coronectomy of unerupted teeth associated with dentigerous cysts is an effective treatment when there is high risk of injury to the inferior dental nerve injury or potential for mandibular fracture. Further work with larger numbers and longer follow-up is required to discover the long-term outcome of the electively retained root.","Patel, Vinod; Sproat, Chris; Samani, Meera; Kwok, Jerry; McGurk, Mark",The British journal of oral & maxillofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2013.02.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23522661/,150

The variable regions of the capsid (VP1) gene of FCV have one of the highest recorded rates of molecular evolution. Understanding the genetic diversity and phylogeny of FCV is a prerequisite to exploring the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this virus and to the development of efficacious vaccine strategies. In this study, we undertook a nationwide molecular characterization of FCV using for the first time nearly complete capsid (VP1) gene sequences. Sequences from 66 FCV samples were used to investigate the correlation between viral phylogeny and several traits, including geographic origin, signalment, husbandry, FCV vaccination and co-infections. Codon-based nucleotide alignment showed that individual nucleotides and their corresponding amino acid sites were either invariant or highly variable. Using a threshold of 20 % genetic distance in variable region E, FCV samples were grouped into 52 strains, 10 of which comprised two to three samples. Significant associations between FCV phylogeny and host characteristics were found, specifically the pedigree status of the cats, and two well-supported lineages were identified in which the current FCV strain definition was confounded. No correlation between viral genetic distances and geographic distances was evident. The greater resolution of the FCV phylogeny in this study compared to previous studies can be attributed to our use of more conserved regions of the capsid (VP1) gene; nonetheless, our results were still hampered by sequence saturation. The study highlights the need for whole-genome sequences for FCV phylogeny studies.","Spiri, Andrea M; Thézé, Julien; Meli, Marina L; Cattori, Valentino; Berger, Alice; Steinrigl, Adolf; Pybus, Oliver G; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Willi, Barbara",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27902382/,150

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the relationship between antiplatelet resistance and clinically silent thromboembolic complications using DWI in patients who underwent coil embolization for unruptured intracranial aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between October 2011 and May 2013, 58 patients with 62 unruptured aneurysms who were measured for antiplatelet response using VerifyNow assay and underwent elective coil embolization for an unruptured aneurysm with posttreatment DWI were enrolled. Diffusion-positive lesions were classified into 3 groups according to the number of lesions (n=0 [grade 0], n<6 [grade I], and n≥6 [grade II]). The relationship between antiplatelet resistance and diffusion-positive lesions was analyzed. RESULTS Sixty-two endovascular coiling procedures were performed on 58 patients. Clopidogrel resistance was revealed in 23 patients (39.7%) and diffusion-positive lesions were demonstrated in 28 patients (48.3%); these consisted of 19 (32.8%) grade I and 9 (15.5%) grade II lesions. Clopidogrel resistance was not relevant to the development of any diffusion-positive lesion (grade I and II, P=.789) but was associated with the development of multiple diffusion-positive lesions (grade II, P=.002). In the logistic regression prediction model, clopidogrel resistance showed significant correlation with the development of grade II lesions (P=.001). CONCLUSIONS Multiple diffusion-positive lesions (≥6 in number) occurred more frequently in patients with clopidogrel resistance after endovascular coiling for unruptured aneurysms.","Kim, B; Kim, K; Jeon, P; Kim, S; Kim, H; Byun, H; Cha, J; Hong, S; Jo, K",AJNR.

127613,Functional CT Contrast Nanoagents for the Tumor Microenvironment.,2020-07-21,"Objectives Procalcitonin (PCT) has been proposed for differentiating viral vs. bacterial infections. In COVID-19, some preliminary results have shown that PCT testing could act as a predictor of bacterial co-infection and be a useful marker for assessment of disease severity. Methods We studied 83 COVID-19 hospitalized patients in whom PCT was specifically ordered by attending physicians. PCT results were evaluated according to the ability to accurately predict bacterial co-infections and death in comparison with other known biomarkers of infection and with major laboratory predictors of COVID-19 severity. Results Thirty-three (39.8%) patients suffered an in-hospital bacterial co-infection and 44 (53.0%) patients died. In predicting bacterial co-infection, PCT showed a relatively low accuracy (area under receiver-operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUC]: 0.757; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.651-0.845), with a strength for detecting the outcome not significantly different from that of white blood cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP). In predicting patient death, PCT showed an AUC of 0.815 (CI: 0.714-0.892), not better than those of other more common laboratory tests, such as blood lymphocyte percentage (AUC: 0.874, p=0.19), serum lactate dehydrogenase (AUC: 0.860, p=0.47), blood neutrophil count (AUC: 0.845, p=0.59), and serum albumin (AUC: 0.839, p=0.73). Conclusions Procalcitonin (PCT) testing, even when appropriately ordered, did not provide a significant added value in COVID-19 patients when compared with more consolidated biomarkers of infection and poor clinical outcome. The major application of PCT in COVID-19 is its ability, associated with a negative predictive value >90%, to exclude a bacterial co-infection when a rule-out cut-off (<0.25 μg/L) is applied.","Dolci, Alberto; Robbiano, Cristina; Aloisio, Elena; Chibireva, Mariia; Serafini, Ludovica; Falvella, Felicia Stefania; Pasqualetti, Sara; Panteghini, Mauro",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-1361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33554505/,150

These phenols have been found to have a large impact on the flavor of wines, being the cause of a smokey flavor with a lasting ashy aftertaste. When evaluating the sensory profile of these wines, there is an observed problem due to the lasting nature of these undesirable attributes and potential flavor carryover between samples. Through the use of standard and temporal attribute check-all-that-apply, this research desires to better understand the impact of smoke on the sensorial profiles of wines with various levels of smoke phenols (high, moderate, and low). Additionally, through the employment of different interstimulus protocols, the effectiveness of rinses on diminishing the smoke flavor in wines and optimal time separation were investigated. It was determined that a 1 g/L pectin rinse in between samples with a 120 s separation is optimal to ensure the removal of smoke attribute perception. This work also indicated the need to look deeper at the effects of the in-mouth hydrolysis of glyconjugate phenols that impact overall smoke flavor.","Fryer, Jenna A; Collins, Thomas S; Tomasino, Elizabeth",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26185444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34576915/,150

Eighty-nine papers meeting the inclusion criteria, i.e., ""Legionella pneumophila"" and ""resistance to antibiotics"", were evaluated according to pre-defined validity criteria. Sixty articles referred to clinical isolates, and 18 articles reported water-related L. pneumophila isolates, while 11 articles included both clinical and water isolates. Several methods have been proposed as suitable for the determination of MICs, such as the E-test, broth and agar dilution, and disk diffusion methods, in vivo and in vitro, using various media. The E-test method proposed by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (EUCAST) seems to be the second most frequently used method overall, but it is the preferred method in the most recent publications (2000-2019) for the interpretation criteria. Erythromycin has been proved to be the preference for resistance testing over the years. However, in the last 19 years, the antibiotics ciprofloxacin (CIP), erythromycin (ERM), levofloxacin (LEV) and azithromycin (AZM) were the ones that saw an increase in their use. A decrease in the sensitivity to antibiotics was identified in approximately half of the reviewed articles.","Pappa, Olga; Chochlakis, Dimosthenis; Sandalakis, Vassilios; Dioli, Chrysa; Psaroulaki, Anna; Mavridou, Athena",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17165809; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796666/,150

In close contact, H was asymptomatic, PCR test was negative and asymptomatic, and he was discharged early. Among the 7 patients, 1 case died of (B) aggravation, and the other patients' condition was effectively controlled after active treatment. Except for the discharged cases, 5 cases were positive for COVID-19 specific IgM antibody and 1 case was negative. In this clustering outbreak, 4 patients remained asymptomatic, but PCR and IgM antibodies were positive, indicating that asymptomatic patients may be the key point to control the epidemic.

129417,Mechanism of the different metabolome responses between Plutella xylostella and Pieris rapae treated with the diamide insecticides.,2020-10-15,"PURPOSE Reduced cognitive function associated with aging has gained increasing attention as the US population ages. Magnesium plays a critical role in vitamin D biosynthesis and metabolism; and deficiencies in magnesium and vitamin D show associations with poor cognition. However, no study has examined their interaction. This study aimed to evaluate the associations of magnesium intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations, indicating vitamin D status, with cognition, and interaction between these nutrients in older adults. METHODS Based on the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014, the study included 2466 participants aged ≥ 60 years who completed the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and had data available on serum 25(OH)D and magnesium intake. Cognitive impairment was defined as a DSST score lower than the lowest quartile. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS Higher total magnesium intake was independently associated with higher DSST scores (highest quartile vs lowest: β = 4.34, 95% CI 1.14-7.54). The association of total magnesium intake with high DSST score was primarily observed among women, non-Hispanic whites, physically active participants and those with sufficient vitamin D status, although the interactions were not significant. The odds of cognitive impairment was reduced with increasing intake of total magnesium (p trend < 0.01) and higher level of serum 25(OH)D (p trend = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest that high magnesium intake alone may improve cognitive function in older adults, and the association may be stronger among subjects with sufficient vitamin D status. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Peeri, Noah C; Egan, Kathleen M; Chai, Weiwen; Tao, Meng-Hua",European journal of nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-020-02267-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388734/,150

Methods: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, we collected and analyzed data form 133 severe COVID-19 patients admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Eastern District) from January 30 to February 18, 2020. Patients were divided into myocardial injury group (n=29) and non-myocardial injury group (n=104) according the presence or absence of myocardial injury. The general information of patients was collected by electronic medical record database system. All patients were followed up for 30 days, the organ injury and/or dysfunction were monitored, the in-hospital death was compared between the two groups, and the disease progression was reevaluated and classified at 14 days after initial hospitalization. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors of myocardial injury in severe COVID-19 patients. The ROC of NLR was calculated, and the AUC was determined to estimate the optimal cut-off value of NLR for predicting myocardial injury in severe cases of COVID-19. Results: There was statistical significance in age, respiratory frequency, systolic blood pressure, symptoms of dyspnea, previous chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease history, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, C-reactive protein, platelet counting, aspartate transaminase, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, urea, estimated glomerular filtration rate, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, D-dimer, CD3+, CD4+, partial pressure of oxygen, partial pressure of CO2, blood oxygen saturation, other organ injury, clinical outcome and prognosis between patients with myocardial injury and without myocardial injury (all P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NLR was a risk factor for myocardial injury (OR=1.066，95%CI 1.021-1.111，P=0.033). ROC curve showed that NLR predicting AUC of myocardial injury in severe COVID-19 patients was 0.774 (95%CI 0.694-0.842), the optimal cut-off value of NLR was 5.768, with a sensitivity of 82.8%, and specificity of 69.5%.

SMA is characterized by motor neuron degeneration resulting in progressive muscle atrophy and weakness. Prior to the emergence of disease-modifying therapies, children with the most severe form of SMA never achieved the ability to sit independently. Only 8% survived beyond 20 months of age without permanent ventilator support. One such therapy, onasemnogene abeparvovec, an adeno-associated virus-based gene replacement therapy, delivers functional human SMN through a one-time intravenous infusion. In addition to substantially improving survival, onasemnogene abeparvovec increased motor milestone attainment and reduced the need for respiratory or nutritional support in many patients. This expert opinion provides recommendations and practical considerations on the patient-centered decisions to use onasemnogene abeparvovec. Recommendations include the need for patient-centered multidisciplinary care and patient selection to identify those with underlying medical conditions or active infections to reduce risks. We also describe the importance of retesting patients with elevated anti-adeno-associated virus serotype 9 antibodies. Recommendations for prednisolone tapering and monitoring for potential adverse events, including hepatotoxicity and thrombotic microangiopathy, are described. The need for caregiver education on managing day-to-day care at time of treatment and patient- and family-centered discussions on realistic expectations are also recommended. We detail the importance of following standard-of-care guidance and long-term monitoring of all children with SMA who have received one or more disease-modifying therapies using registries and highlight the need for presymptomatic or early symptomatic treatment.","Kichula, Elizabeth A; Proud, Crystal M; Farrar, Michelle A; Kwon, Jennifer M; Saito, Kayoko; Desguerre, Isabelle; McMillan, Hugh J",Muscle & nerve,https://doi.org/10.1002/mus.27363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196026/,150
130759,Enhanced skin delivery of vismodegib by microneedle treatment.,2015,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is known to take an endosomal pathway for cell entry; however, it is thought to enter directly from the cell surface when a receptor-bound virion spike (S) protein is affected by trypsin, which induces cleavage of the S protein and activates its fusion potential. This suggests that SARS-CoV bearing a cleaved form of the S protein can enter cells directly from the cell surface without trypsin treatment. To explore this possibility, we introduced a furin-like cleavage sequence in the S protein at amino acids 798 to 801 and found that the mutated S protein was cleaved and induced cell fusion without trypsin treatment when expressed on the cell surface. Furthermore, a pseudotype virus bearing a cleaved S protein was revealed to infect cells in the presence of a lysosomotropic agent as well as a protease inhibitor, both of which are known to block SARS-CoV infection via an endosome, whereas the infection of pseudotypes with an uncleaved, wild-type S protein was blocked by these agents. A heptad repeat peptide, derived from a SARS-CoV S protein that is known to efficiently block infections from the cell surface, blocked the infection by a pseudotype with a cleaved S protein but not that with an uncleaved S protein. Those results indicate that SARS-CoV with a cleaved S protein is able to enter cells directly from the cell surface and agree with the previous observation of the protease-mediated cell surface entry of SARS-CoV.","Watanabe, Rie; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Shirato, Kazuya; Maejima, Masami; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Morikawa, Shigeru; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01412-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18786990/,150

Methods Plasma obtained from nineteen, older COVID-19 patients having mild or severe infection was subjected to protein-A affinity chromatography to obtain immunoglobulin G fraction. One-fortieth dilution of the protein-A eluate was tested for binding to a linear synthetic peptide QN.18 corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the human 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor. Mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells were incubated with COVID-19 IgG autoantibodies in the presence or absence of selective inhibitors of G-protein coupled receptors, signaling pathway antagonists, or a novel decoy receptor peptide. Results 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor autoantibody binding occurred in 17 of 19 (89%) patients with acute COVID-19 infection and increased level was significantly correlated with increased severity of COVID-19 infection. The agonist autoantibodies mediated acute neurite retraction in mouse neuroblastoma cells by a mechanism involving Gq11/PLC/IP3R/Ca2+ activation and RhoA/Rho kinase pathway signaling occurring downstream of receptor binding which had pharmacologic specificity consistent with binding to the 5-HT2A receptor. A novel synthetic peptide 5-HT2AR fragment, SN..8, dose-dependently blocked autoantibody-induced neurotoxicity. The COVID-19 autoantibodies displayed acute toxicity in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (stress fiber formation, contraction) and modulated proliferation in a manner consistent with known 'biased agonism' on the 5-HT2A receptor. Conclusion These data suggest that 5-HT2AR targeting autoantibodies are highly prevalent may contribute to pathophysiology in acute, severe COVID-19 infection.","Zimering, Mark B","Endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism journal",https://doi.org/10.31038/edmj.2021511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33680365/,150

Fluvoxamine strongly binds to the sigma-1 receptor (S1R) that regulates inflammation by inhibiting the production of cytokines, believed to be responsible for severe COVID-19. We evaluated the S1R locus on chr 9p13.3 in subjects tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We focused on SNP rs17775810 that has been previously identified by examining loss-of-function mutations in the S1R gene associated with distal hereditary motor neuropathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS We utilized UK Biobank (UKB) data. Data processing was performed on Minerva, a Linux mainframe with Centos 7.6, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. RESULTS The effect of rs17775810 genotype on survival was significant (p=0.036, 2 tailed Fisher exact test). The minor allele homozygotes (TT) had the lowest death rate (0%), whereas the non-TT genotypes (i.e. CT and CC) had the highest death rate (16.2%).

The objective of this study was to survey the use of smartphone-based medical apps among dentists in China and determine dentists' perceptions of such apps. METHODS All data were collected using anonymous questionnaires. The questionnaires for this cross-sectional study were randomly sent to dentists by email, and 379 dentists responded. Dentists' demographics and perceptions of WeChat, QQ (the most popular social media apps in China) and other medical apps were assessed; the questionnaire including questions on the purpose, frequency, daily use, and opinion of the apps they used. Questions were answered using a Likert scale (1 = strongly agree, 2 = agree, 3 = not sure, 4 = disagree, and 5 = strongly disagree). RESULTS A total of 379 valid responses were received; the respondents had a median age of 33.6 years old (63.3% female). All subjects (100%) owned a smartphone, and all of them installed and used WeChat or QQ in their clinical practice. Only 76% of subjects installed medical apps (other than WeChat and QQ) on their smartphones. Male dentists were more likely to install medical apps than female dentists (p < 0.05). With increasing age, the percentage of dentists who installed medical apps decreased (p < 0.001). The frequency and daily use were higher for WeChat and QQ than for medical apps. Medical apps were positively perceived, with dentists reporting that they recommend these medical apps to their peers (Likert score: 1.67 ± 0.68). CONCLUSION Medical apps were perceived to have a positive impact on clinical practice, education and patient care in dentistry by providing relevant medical information.

However, working memory is generally studied as a unified system within the cortisol literature. The present study sought to determine if cortisol increases are positively associated with increases in performance in the encoding subprocess of working memory, and whether increases are positively or negatively associated with performance changes in the maintenance subprocess. Thirty-three young men (M = 19.4 years, SD = 0.89) participated in a change-detection task, consisting of a condition requiring encoding only and a condition requiring both encoding and maintenance. To elicit a cortisol response, participants completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) between two administrations of the task. Cardiovascular measurements and saliva samples were obtained before the TSST (T1), and mid-way between blocks of the second administration of the change-detection task (T2), to measure autonomic and cortisol responses to the TSST evident during the second change-detection task. Cortisol increases between T1 and T2 were positively correlated with both encoding (r(32) = 0.503, p = 0.003) and maintenance (r(32) = 0.463, p = 0.007) performance. This is a novel finding as previous studies have shown an impairing effect of cortisol on working memory. The positive relation between cortisol and working memory has likely been obscured in previous tasks, which did not examine these specific subprocesses in isolation from each other.

Despite a dramatic decrease of donation and transplantation activities during the critical early weeks of the outbreak, the program has recovered and is now rebuilding in the context of COVID-19. METHODS We describe the four pillars upon which the Spanish donation and transplantation program has been rebuilt. RESULTS 1. Standards have been developed and progressively updated for the evaluation and selection of potential donors and recipients with regards to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 2. Spain has been actively generating evidence to assess the validity of our standards and to understand the natural history of the infection in transplant recipients. No case of donor-derived COVID-19 has been reported to date. COVID-19 in Spain has been more frequent and has had a more aggressive course in recipients of solid organ transplants than in the general population, this seems largely explained by the demographics and comorbidity of transplant patients. 3. As a result of this evidence and experience, recommendations have been issued for the management of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients and candidates on the waiting list. 4. Finally, concrete guidance has been issued for centers to manage the donation and transplantation programs in relation to the dynamic and heterogeneous epidemiological challenges. CONCLUSIONS The Spanish experience confronting the impact of COVID-19 upon donation and transplantation may help serve the needs of a broader community in other countries.","Domínguez-Gil, Beatriz; Fernández-Ruiz, Mario; Hernández, Domingo; Crespo, Marta; Colmenero, Jordi; Coll, Elisabeth; Rubio, Juan José",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165237/,150

132231,Long-term follow-up after bariatric surgery in a national cohort.,2017,"BACKGROUND The presence of any underlying heart condition could influence outcomes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS The registry HOPE-COVID-19 (Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for COVID-19, NCT04334291) is an international ambispective study, enrolling COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital, dead or alive. RESULTS HOPE enrolled 2798 patients from 35 centers in 7 countries. Median age was 67 years (IQR: 53.0-78.0), and most were male (59.5%). A relevant heart disease was present in 682 (24%) cases. These were older, more frequently male, with higher overall burden of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking habit, obesity) and other comorbidities such renal failure, lung, cerebrovascular disease and oncologic antecedents (p < 0.01, for all). The heart cohort received more corticoids (28.9% vs. 20.4%, p < 0.001), antibiotics, but less hydroxychloroquine, antivirals or tocilizumab. Considering the epidemiologic profile, a previous heart condition was independently related with short-term mortality in the COX multivariate analysis (1.62; 95% CI 1.29-2.03; p < 0.001). Moreover, heart patients needed more respiratory, circulatory support, and presented more in-hospital events, such heart failure, renal failure, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, SIRS and clinically relevant bleedings (all, p < 0.001), and mortality (39.7% vs. 15.5%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS An underlying heart disease is an adverse prognostic factor for patients suffering COVID-19. Its presence could be related with different clinical drug management and would benefit from maintaining treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers during in-hospital stay.

Our main technical result is an efficient algorithm for computing an optimum structural alignment of an RNA sequence against a genomic substring. This algorithm has two applications. First, by scanning a genome, we can identify novel (homologous) pseudoknotted ncRNA, and second, we can infer the secondary structure of the target aligned sequence. We test an implementation of our algorithm (PAL) and show that it has near-perfect behavior for predicting the structure of many known pseudoknots. Additionally, it can detect the true homologs with high sensitivity and specificity in controlled tests. We also use PAL to search entire viral genome and mouse genome for novel homologs of some viral and eukaryotic pseudoknots, respectively. In each case, we have found strong support for novel homologs.","Han, Buhm; Dost, Banu; Bafna, Vineet; Zhang, Shaojie",Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1089/cmb.2007.0214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18549303/,150

134043,Current Status and Future Perspectives of Renal Denervation.,2021-06-08,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to clarify the usefulness of a no-touch pincer ablation procedure that uses bipolar electrodes to prevent intrasubsegmental tumor recurrence after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS We studied 303 consecutive patients with HCC (single nodule and tumor diameter ≤30 mm) who received RFA between January 2005 and April 2015; 268 patients received touch ablation using a monopolar or bipolar RFA device, and 35 received no-touch ablation using a bipolar RFA device. The pretreatment arterial and portal phase dynamic computed tomography or magnetic resonance images were classified into four enhancement patterns. Type 1 and Type 2 are homogeneous enhancement patterns without or with increased arterial blood flow, respectively. Type 3 is a heterogeneous enhancement pattern with a septum-like structure, and Type 4 is an irregularly shaped ring structure enhancement pattern. RESULTS With regard to intrasubsegmental tumor recurrence, among the 268 patients who underwent the touch ablation procedure, tumors recurred in 52 (19.4%) patients, and among the 35 patients who underwent the no-touch ablation procedure, tumors recurred in one (2.9%) patient. Cumulative intrasubsegmental tumor recurrence rates tended to be higher with touch ablation (P = 0.083). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that ablation procedure (touch ablation, hazard ratio [HR] 10.32, P = 0.032), type of enhancement pattern (Type 3, HR 3.05, P = 0.006; and Type 4, HR 8.87, P < 0.001) and serum des-γ-carboxyprothrombin level (≥100 AU/L; HR 2.73, P = 0.035) were significant predictors for intrasubsegmental recurrence. CONCLUSION The no-touch pincer ablation procedure has the potential to prevent intrasubsegmental recurrence after RFA for patients with HCC.","Kawamura, Yusuke; Ikeda, Kenji; Fujiyama, Shunichiro; Hosaka, Tetsuya; Kobayashi, Masahiro; Saitoh, Satoshi; Sezaki, Hitomi; Akuta, Norio; Suzuki, Fumitaka; Suzuki, Yoshiyuki; Arase, Yasuji; Kumada, Hiromitsu",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/hepr.12838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27862748/,150

Safety and reliability are considered by patients and clinicians when selecting among the different models of cochlear implants. However, comparing reliability estimates from different manufacturers is difficult because of the lack of a standardized approach for classifying and quantifying failure data. This paper develops a classification scheme for cochlear implant failures wherein each failure report is categorized based on the failure site, cause, mode, and mechanism obtained through failure modes, mechanisms, and effects analysis. Failure parameters based on the Weibull distribution are used to quantify the following reliability metrics: B1, B5, B10, and B50 lives. The developed reporting scheme provides clear and quantitative information on failure causes and failure sites for a given implant. This method provides a consistent reporting format for communicating field reliability to regulatory units, clinicians, and patients.","Tessa, Liliane L; Sood, Bhanu P; Pecht, Michael G",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2015.2412127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25775485/,150
134951,AI identifies distinct subgroups of HFpEF.,2021-03-19,"BACKGROUND Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of lesions with coronary arterial calcification (CAC) is common and has been historically associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Whether the association between target lesion calcification (CAC) and outcomes differ across drug-eluting stent generation or between patients with high vs. low residual platelet reactivity (PR) remains unknown. We assessed the association of CAC with adverse ischemic and bleeding events among patients undergoing contemporary PCI with drug-eluting stents (DES). METHODS We included all 8582 patients who underwent successful PCI with DES in the prospective ADAPT-DES study. Patients were grouped according to whether or not they had CAC. We used a multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine independent predictors of CAC. We assessed the 2-year risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE: Death, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis) and bleeding by constructing Kaplan-Meier curves and fitting unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. We assessed the influence of DES generation and PR on the effect of CAC on outcomes by including interaction terms in the models. RESULTS CAC was present in 2644 (30.8%) patients. Age, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin-treated diabetes, hemodialysis, and peripheral artery disease were independent predictors of CAC. Having a CAC was associated with increased unadjusted and adjusted hazards for 2-year MACE and bleeding. The association between CAC and ischemic outcomes was consistent across DES generations and PR (pinteraction>0.05). CONCLUSION Contemporary DES PCI of calcified lesions is common and is associated with an increased risk of ischemic and bleeding complications.","Généreux, Philippe; Redfors, Björn; Witzenbichler, Bernhard; Arsenault, Marie-Pier; Weisz, Giora; Stuckey, Thomas D; Rinaldi, Michael J; Neumann, Franz-Josef; Christopher Metzger, D; Henry, Timothy D; Cox, David A; Duffy, Peter L; Mazzaferri, Ernest L; Francese, Dominic P; Marquis-Gravel, Guillaume; Mintz, Gary S; Kirtane, Ajay J; Maehara, Akiko; Mehran, Roxana; Stone, Gregg W",International journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.12.150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28040289/,150
135078,Clinical evaluation of gauze-based negative pressure wound therapy in challenging wounds.,2013,"Viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) often cause disease in an age-dependent manner, with greater neuropathology during the fetal and neonatal periods. Transgenic CD46+ mice model these age dependent outcomes through a measles virus infection of CNS neurons. Adult CD46+ mice control viral spread and survive the infection in an interferon gamma (IFNγ)-dependent manner, whereas neonatal CD46+ mice succumb despite similar IFNγ expression in the brain. Thus, we hypothesized that IFNγ signaling in the adult brain may be more robust, potentially due to greater basal expression of IFNγ signaling proteins. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the expression of canonical IFNγ signaling proteins in the neonatal and adult brain, including the IFNγ receptor, Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) in the absence of infection. We also analyzed the expression and activation of STAT1 and IFNγ-stimulated genes during MV infection. We found that neonatal brains have equivalent or greater JAK/STAT1 expression in the hippocampus and the cerebellum than adults. IFNγ receptor expression varied by cell type in the brain but was widely expressed on neuronal and glial cells. During MV infection, increased STAT1 expression and activation correlated with viral load in the hippocampus regardless of age, but not in the cerebellum where viral load was consistently undetectable in adults. These results suggest the neonatal brain is capable of initiating IFNγ signaling during a viral infection, but that downstream STAT1 activation is insufficient to limit viral spread.","Creisher, Patrick S; Chandwani, Manisha N; Kamte, Yashika S; Covvey, Jordan R; Ganesan, Priya; O'Donnell, Lauren A",Developmental neurobiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/dneu.22778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32866337/,150

136116,Tannic acid-functionalized boron nitride nanosheets for theranostics.,2020-09-08,"West Nile virus and dengue virus are mosquito-borne flaviviruses that cause a large number of human infections each year. No vaccines or chemotherapeutics are currently available. These viruses encode a serine protease that is essential for polyprotein processing, a required step in the viral replication cycle. In this study, a high-throughput screening assay for the West Nile virus protease was employed to screen approximately 32,000 small-molecule compounds for identification of inhibitors. Lead inhibitor compounds with three distinct core chemical structures (1 to 3) were identified. In a secondary screening of selected compounds, two compounds, belonging to the 8-hydroxyquinoline family (compounds A and B) and containing core structure 1, were identified as potent inhibitors of the West Nile virus protease, with K(i) values of 3.2 +/- 0.3 microM and 3.4 +/- 0.6 microM, respectively. These compounds inhibited the dengue virus type 2 protease with K(i) values of 28.6 +/- 5.1 microM and 30.2 +/- 8.6 microM, respectively, showing some selectivity in the inhibition of these viral proteases. However, the compounds show no inhibition of cellular serine proteases, trypsin, or factor Xa. Kinetic analysis and molecular docking of compound B onto the known crystal structure of the West Nile virus protease indicate that the inhibitor binds in the substrate-binding cleft. Furthermore, compound B was capable of inhibiting West Nile virus RNA replication in cultured Vero cells (50% effective concentration, 1.4 +/- 0.4 microM; selectivity index, 100), presumably by inhibition of polyprotein processing.","Mueller, Niklaus H; Pattabiraman, Nagarajan; Ansarah-Sobrinho, Camilo; Viswanathan, Prasanth; Pierson, Theodore C; Padmanabhan, R",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01508-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18606844/,150

METHODS We identified 952,420 nonelderly adults (between 18 and 64 years of age) in five health care markets across the United States between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007. Utilization data were used to estimate cumulative effective doses of radiation from imaging procedures and to calculate population-based rates of exposure, with annual effective doses defined as low (< or = 3 mSv), moderate (> 3 to 20 mSv), high (> 20 to 50 mSv), or very high (> 50 mSv). RESULTS During the study period, 655,613 enrollees (68.8%) underwent at least one imaging procedure associated with radiation exposure. The mean (+/-SD) cumulative effective dose from imaging procedures was 2.4+/-6.0 mSv per enrollee per year; however, a wide distribution was noted, with a median effective dose of 0.1 mSv per enrollee per year (interquartile range, 0.0 to 1.7). Overall, moderate effective doses of radiation were incurred in 193.8 enrollees per 1000 per year, whereas high and very high doses were incurred in 18.6 and 1.9 enrollees per 1000 per year, respectively. In general, cumulative effective doses of radiation from imaging procedures increased with advancing age and were higher in women than in men. Computed tomographic and nuclear imaging accounted for 75.4% of the cumulative effective dose, with 81.8% of the total administered in outpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS Imaging procedures are an important source of exposure to ionizing radiation in the United States and can result in high cumulative effective doses of radiation.","Fazel, Reza; Krumholz, Harlan M; Wang, Yongfei; Ross, Joseph S; Chen, Jersey; Ting, Henry H; Shah, Nilay D; Nasir, Khurram; Einstein, Andrew J; Nallamothu, Brahmajee K",The New England journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa0901249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19710483/,150
136527,Exciting New Developments and Emerging Themes in Glycosaminoglycan Research.,2020-11-12,"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an urgent health threat being the most common healthcare-associated infection, and its management is a clinical conundrum. Over 450 000 infections are seen in the United States with similar incidence seen in the rest of the developed world. The majority of infections seen are mild-moderate with fulminant disease and mortality being rare complications seen in the elderly and in those with comorbidities. The most common complication of CDI is recurrent infection with rates as high as 60% after three or more infections. A dilemma in the management of primary and recurrent CDI is testing due to the high sensitivity of the nucleic acid amplification tests such as the polymerase chain reaction, which leads to clinical false positives if patients are not chosen carefully (with symptoms) before testing. A newer testing regimen involving a 2-step strategy is emerging using glutamate dehydrogenase as a screening strategy followed by enzyme immunoassay for the C. difficile toxin. Microbiota restoration therapies are the cornerstone of management of recurrent CDI to prevent future recurrences. The most common modality of microbiota restoration is faecal microbiota transplantation, which has been tainted with heterogeneity and adverse events such as serious infectious transmission. The success rates for recurrence prevention from microbiota restoration therapies are over 90% compared with less than 50% of recurrence prevention with courses of antibiotics. This has led to development and emergence of standardized microbiota restoration therapies in capsule and enema forms. Capsule-based therapies include CP101 (positive phase II results), RBX7455 (positive phase I results), SER-109 (positive phase III results) and VE303 (ongoing phase II trial). Enema-based therapy includes RBX2660 (positive phase III data). This review summarizes the principles of management and diagnosis of CDI and focuses on emerging and existing data on faecal microbiota transplantation and standardized microbiota restoration therapies.","Khanna, S",Journal of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.13290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33856727/,150

The aim of this study was to investigate the optimal time interval between endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS PubMed and Embase were searched for studies comparing different time delays between endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials were included. Primary outcome was conversion rate from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy and secondary outcomes were complications, mortality, operating time, and length of stay. RESULTS A total of 14 studies with a total of 1930 patients were included. The pooled estimate revealed an increase from a 4.2% conversion rate when laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed within 24 h of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to 7.6% for 24-72 h delay to 12.3% when performed within 2 weeks, to 12.3% for 2-6 weeks, and to a 14% conversion rate when operation was delayed more than 6 weeks. CONCLUSION According to this systematic review, it is preferable to perform cholecystectomy within 24 h of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to reduce conversion rate. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy does not increase mortality, perioperative complications, or length of stay and on the contrary it reduces the risk of reoccurrence and progression of disease in the delay between endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","Friis, C; Rothman, J P; Burcharth, J; Rosenberg, J",Scandinavian journal of surgery : SJS : official organ for the Finnish Surgical Society and the Scandinavian Surgical Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1457496917748224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29277136/,150

BACKGROUND Small studies in patients with stable coronary artery disease have suggested a worse prognosis after PCI of calcified compared with noncalcified lesions. Little is known about the impact of coronary calcification on outcomes after PCI for patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation and ST-segment elevation ACS. METHODS Data from 6,855 patients presenting with ACS in whom PCI was performed were pooled from 2 large-scale randomized, controlled trials, ACUITY (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy) and HORIZONS-AMI (Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction). One-year outcomes were analyzed according to the severity of PCI target lesion calcification (none/mild, moderate, or severe) as assessed by an independent angiographic core laboratory. RESULTS Target lesion calcification was severe in 402 patients (5.9%), moderate in 1,788 (26.1%), and none/mild in 4,665 (68.1%). Moderate/severe target lesion calcification was more frequent in older patients, men, hypertensive patients, and those presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The unadjusted 1-year rates of death, cardiac death, definite stent thrombosis, and ischemic target lesion revascularization (TLR) and target vessel revascularization were significantly increased in patients with moderate/severe target lesion calcification. By multivariable analysis, the presence of moderate/severe target lesion calcification was an independent predictor of 1-year definite stent thrombosis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14 to 2.30; p = 0.007) and ischemic TLR (HR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.78; p = 0.0007). CONCLUSIONS Moderate/severe lesion calcification was relatively frequent in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS and STEMI and was strongly predictive of stent thrombosis and ischemic TLR at 1 year.

The purpose of this literature review was to compile and analyze brain MR imaging findings in patients with COVID-19-related illness. MATERIALS AND METHODS Literature searches of PubMed, publicly available Internet search engines, and medical journal Web sites were performed to identify articles published before May 30, 2020 that described MR imaging brain findings in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS Twenty-two articles were included in the analysis: 5 investigational studies, 6 case series, and 11 case reports, encompassing MR imaging of the brain in 126 patients. The articles originated from 7 different countries and were published in 14 medical journals. MR imaging brain findings included specific diagnoses (such as acute infarct, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) or specific imaging features (such as cortical FLAIR signal abnormality, microhemorrhages). CONCLUSIONS The most frequent diagnoses made on brain MR imaging in patients with COVID-19 were acute and subacute infarcts. Other common findings included a constellation of leukoencephalopathy and microhemorrhages, leptomeningeal contrast enhancement, and cortical FLAIR signal abnormality.","Gulko, E; Oleksk, M L; Gomes, W; Ali, S; Mehta, H; Overby, P; Al-Mufti, F; Rozenshtein, A",AJNR.

At the beginning of 2020, a sudden outbreak of novel pneumonia, originated from Wuhan, China, swiftly evolves to a worldwide pandemic, alike the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. However, Chinese-style innovation in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 helped China to reach a faster and more effective success in the containment of this epidemic. This review summarizes insights from the comparisons of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19 outbreaks on the basis of preventive strategies in China for this coronavirus pandemic.","Liu, Wen-Yi; Chuang, Yen-Ching; Liu, Ting-Jun; Chien, Ching-Wen; Tung, Tao-Hsin",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000024650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33578592/,150
138136,Exploring marine resources for bioactive compounds.,2014,"PURPOSE Niclosamide, an FDA-approved anthelmintic drug, has been characterized as a potent Wnt inhibitor that can suppress tumor growth and cancer stem-like cell (CSC) populations. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aimed to examine how Wnt inhibition by niclosamide preferentially targets CSCs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN The mechanistic role of niclosamide in CSC inhibition was examined in public databases, human colorectal cancer cells, colorectal cancer xenografts, and azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced colorectal cancer model. RESULTS Niclosamide suppresses CSC populations and their self-renewal activities in colorectal cancer cells, and this CSC-targeting effect leads to irreversible disruption of tumor-initiating potential in vivo. Mechanistically, niclosamide downregulates multiple signaling components of the Wnt pathway, specifically lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) expression, which is critical for regulating stemness. Subsequently, we identified that the doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1)-B is a target of LEF1 and upregulates cancer stemness in colorectal cancer cells. We first documented that niclosamide blocks the transcription of DCLK1-B by interrupting the binding of LEF1 to DCLK1-B promoter. DCLK1-B depletion impairs cancer stemness resulting in reduced survival potential and increased apoptosis, thus sensitizing colorectal cancer to chemoradiation. CONCLUSIONS Disruption of the LEF1/DCLK1-B axis by niclosamide eradicates cancer stemness and elicits therapeutic effects on colorectal cancer initiation, progression, and resistance. These findings provide a preclinical rationale to broaden the clinical evaluation of niclosamide for the treatment of colorectal cancer.","Park, So-Yeon; Kim, Ji-Young; Choi, Jang-Hyun; Kim, Jee-Heun; Lee, Choong-Jae; Singh, Pomila; Sarkar, Shubhashish; Baek, Jeong-Heum; Nam, Jeong-Seok",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-18-1232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30446587/,150

Pre- and post-NAC CEM images of 36 consecutive BC patients receiving NAC in 2012-2020, with calcifications in the tumor bed at diagnosis, were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists; described were absence/presence and size of residual disease based on contrast enhancement (CE) only and CE plus calcifications. Twenty-eight patients (77.8%) had invasive and 5 (13.9%) in situ-only residual disease at surgical specimen pathology. Considering CE plus calcifications instead of CE only, CEM sensitivity for invasive residual tumor increased from 85.7% (95% CI = 67.3-96%) to 96.4% (95% CI = 81.7-99.9%) and specificity decreased from 5/8 (62.5%; 95% CI = 24.5-91.5%) to 1/8 (14.3%; 95% CI = 0.4-57.9%). For in situ-only residual disease, false negatives decreased from 3 to 0 and false positives increased from 1 to 2.

However, SAHA has adverse effects such as poor pharmacokinetic properties and severe toxicities in clinical use. In order to identify better HDAC inhibitors, a compound database was established by core hopping of SAHA, which was then docked into HDAC-8 (PDB ID: 1T69) active site to select a number of candidates with higher docking score and better interaction with catalytic zinc ion. Further ADMET prediction was done to give ten compounds. Molecular dynamics simulation of the representative compound 101 was performed to study the stability of HDAC8-inhibitor system.

Objective of our study was to compare in two blind randomized groups of patients, the surgical outcome of total extra-peritoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair using either single-port or conventional surgical technique. We will report our interim results in the first group of 50 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our study is a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted from August 2011 to June 2013. Fifty patients aged between 21 and 80 years undergoing surgery for unilateral inguinal hernia were randomised into two groups: conventional laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair versus single-port TEP repair. Clinical data on patient demographics, surgical technique and findings, postoperative complications and pain scores were collected. Primary endpoint is the postoperative pain while secondary endpoints are recurrence, chronic pain, postoperative hospital stay and complications. RESULTS Out of the 50 patients, 26 underwent single-port hernia TEP repair and 24 had conventional 3-port TEP hernia repair after randomization. Mean operative time was 51.7 (±13.4) min in the multiport group and 59.3 (±14.9) min in the single-port group, respectively (P = 0.064). Mean hospital stay was 19.7 (±4.8) h in the conventional group and 22.1 (±4.5) h in the single-port group (P = 0.079). No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups for postoperative complications, and no recurrence reported at 11 months follow-up. There was no significant difference in the pain scores (visual analog scale) between the two groups at regular intervals post surgery. DISCUSSION The outcomes after laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair with a single-port device are comparable to the standard three-port technique.","Wijerathne, Sujith; Agarwal, Narendra; Ramzy, Ahmad; Lomanto, Davide",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3578-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902814/,150

Completion of increasingly complicated procedures has been facilitated by technical advances in instrumentation. Lately, increasing attention has been paid to reducing both the number and size of laparoscopic incisions, with the ultimate goal being the absence of any visible scar. Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS), or single-incision laparoscopy, describes the use of 1 small skin incision to complete laparoscopic surgical procedures where traditionally multiple incisions were created. In addition to examining the developing literature related to LESS in gynecology, the aims of this review were to describe the technical challenges encountered during performance of LESS and to provide practical solutions for instrumentation and surgical techniques that allow them to be overcome. TARGET AUDIENCE Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians LEARNING OBJECTIVES After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to identify potential benefits of LESS, and implement practical solutions for instrumentation and surgical techniques to overcome technical challenges faced during LESS.","Bradford, Leslie S; Boruta, David M",Obstetrical & gynecological survey,https://doi.org/10.1097/ogx.0b013e318286f673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23943039/,150

The microwave ring resonator was designed to operate at 1.76 GHz to detect variations in the dielectric properties such as permittivity and loss tangent to monitor bacterial growth. The sensor demonstrated high efficiency in monitoring subsurface dynamics of E. coli growth between two layers of LB agar. The resonant amplitude variations (Δ Amplitude (dB)) were recorded for different volumes of E. coli (3 μL and 9 μL) and compared to control without E. coli for 36 hours. The control showed a maximum amplitude variation of 0.037 dB, which was selected as a threshold to distinguish between the presence and absence of E. coli growth. The measured results by sensors were further supported by microscopic images. It is worth noticing that the amplitude variations fit well with the Gompertz growth model. The rate of amplitude change correlating bacteria growth rate was calculated as 0.08 and 0.13 dB/hr. for 3 μL and 9 μL of E. coli, respectively.

The aim of this study was to compare three different methods of securing a TT to prevent extubation following a surgical cricothyroidotomy. METHODS A randomised controlled trial was undertaken. The population studied were emergency physicians (EPs) attending a cadaveric airway course. The intervention was securing a TT placed via a surgical cricothyroidotomy by suture. The comparison was securing the TT using fabric tape with two different tying techniques. The primary outcome was the force required to extubate the trachea. The trial was registered with ANZCTR.org.au (ACTRN12621000320853). RESULTS 17 emergency physicians completed intubations using all three of the securing methods on 12 cadavers for a total of 51 experiments. The mean extubation force was 6.54 KG (95 % CI 5.54-7.55) in the suture group compared with 2.28 KG (95 % CI 1.91-2.64) in the 'Wilko tie' group and 2.12 KG (95 % CI 1.63-2.60) in the 'Lark's foot tie' group; The mean difference between the suture and fabric tie techniques was significant (p < 0.001).

Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) is an instrument that has a demonstrated ability to objectively monitor the wound healing process in various patient populations but has not yet been used in acute burn wounds. The aim of the pilot study was to examine whether the BIS technique is a valid measure of wound healing. Localised BIS resistance and phase angle triplicate measures, of minor limb burns, were collected on two serial occasions. Circumference limb measures were taken at the localised burn site to determine a truncated limb volume. Proportional-odds ordered logistic regression analyses determined resistance at zero frequency (R0, indicative of edema) and resistance of total body fluid (Rinf) were significantly associated with healing after adjustment for the influence of surgery. A one unit increase in R0 and Rinf increased the odds of wound healing by 6% and 5% respectively (p<0.01). Phase angle at 50kHz and Ri were not significantly associated with the markers of the wound healing process.

141304,A two-concentric-loop iterative method in estimation of displacement height and roughness length for momentum and sensible heat.,2008,"BACKGROUND Recent studies have noted that the circulating testosterone concentration may affect the ability of sperm to survive cryopreservation. However, few attempts to confirm such a relationship have been made. Wild ruminant species have very marked seasonal changes in their reproductive function and strong annual changes in their plasma testosterone concentration. OBJECTIVES The present work examines the influence of induced changes in testosterone secretion on sperm variables following conventional slow freezing and ultra-rapid freezing, using the Iberian ibex as an experimental model. MATERIALS AND METHODS In a first experiment, testosterone levels were reduced in the middle of the rutting season (December) using the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate (CA). In a second experiment, testosterone levels were increased at end of the rutting season (January) via the use of the androgen testosterone propionate (TP). RESULTS During December, the testosterone concentration was found to be higher in the blood and seminal plasma of untreated males than of CA-treated males (P<0.001 and P<0.05 respectively). Compared to controls, the TP-treated animals had higher blood plasma testosterone concentrations but lower seminal plasma testosterone concentrations during January (P<0.01 and P<0.001 respectively). The seminal vesicles of the TP-treated males were larger than those of untreated males (P<0.05). When CA was administered, sperm viability improved compared to controls (P<0.05), irrespective of the freezing protocol followed. For the ultra-rapid freezing procedure, the cryoresistance ratio for motility decreased when TP was administered (P<0.05). The values for fresh sperm morphometric variables decreased during the 50 days after the end of CA-treatment (P<0.001), and increased over the same time after the end of TP treatment (P<0.001). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The circulating testosterone concentration appears to influence sperm cryoresistance. This may explain the seasonal changes seen in sperm freezability in some species, independent of fresh sperm quality.","Bóveda, Paula; Esteso, Milagros Cristina; Velázquez, Rosario; Castaño, Cristina; Toledano-Díaz, Adolfo; López-Sebastián, Antonio; Mejía, Octavio; Millán de la Blanca, María Gemma; Ungerfeld, Rodolfo; Santiago-Moreno, Julián",Andrology,https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33686789/,150

Postmortem histological analysis revealed degeneration of neuronal cells, alveolar epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and renal tubular epithelial cells. Infiltration of macrophages was observed in the nervous system and visceral organs. The cytoplasm of neuronal cells was filled with Luxol fast blue (LFB)-negative and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-negative granules, and the cytoplasm of macrophages was LFB-positive and PAS-negative. Ultrastructurally, concentric deposits were observed in the brain and visceral organs. Genetic and biochemical analysis revealed a nonsense mutation (c.1017G>A) in the SMPD1 gene, a decrease of SMPD1 mRNA expression, and reduced acid sphingomyelinase immunoreactivity. Therefore, this cat was diagnosed as having Niemann-Pick disease with a mutation in the SMPD1 gene, a syndrome analogous to human Niemann-Pick disease type A.","Takaichi, Yuta; Chambers, James K; Kok, Mun Keong; Uchiyama, Hiroki; Haritani, Makoto; Hasegawa, Daisuke; Nakayama, Hiroyuki; Uchida, Kazuyuki",Veterinary pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985820921810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32347185/,150
142213,Sustained and targeted delivery of checkpoint inhibitors by metal-organic frameworks for cancer immunotherapy.,2021-01-01,"OBJECTIVES Presently, the pandemic of COVID-19 has worsened the situation worldwide and received global attention. The United States of America have the highest numbers of a patient infected by this disease followed by Brazil, Russia, India and many other countries. Moreover, lots of research is going on to find out effective vaccines or medicine, but still, no potent vaccine or drug is discovered to cure COVID-19. As a consequence, many types of research have designated that computer-based studies, such as protein-ligand interactions, structural dynamics, and chembio modeling are the finest choice due to its low cost and time-saving features. Here, oxindole derivatives have been chosen for docking because of their immense pharmacological applications like antiviral, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and so on. Molecular docking of 30 oxindole derivatives done on the crystallized structure of the protein (COVID-19 Mpro). METHODS The process of docking, interaction, and binding the structure of ligand with protein has executed using Molegro Virtual Docker v.7.0.0 (MVD) and visualized the usage by Molegro Molecular Viewer v.7.0.0 (MMV). RESULTS Among the 30 derivatives, the outcomes depicted better steric interaction and hydrogen bonding amongst OD-22 ligand, OD-16 ligand, OD-4 ligand, and OD-9 ligand (oxindole derivatives) with COVID-19. In addition to this, the comparative study of these four compounds with existing drugs that are under clinical trials shows comparatively good results in terms of its MolDock scores, H-bonding and steric interactions. CONCLUSIONS Hence, It is proposed that these four oxindole derivatives have good potential as a new drug against coronavirus as possible therapeutic agents.","Shah, Vraj R; Bhaliya, Jaydip D; Patel, Gautam M",Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1515/jbcpp-2020-0262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594850/,150
142278,Dravet syndrome: A quick transition guide for the adult neurologist.,2021-08-18,"INTRODUCTION The new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019. Some authors reported evidences that patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection could have a direct involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, and in symptomatic cases, gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain) could be very common. Area covered: In this article, we reviewed current published data of the gastrointestinal aspects involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection, including prevalence and incidence of specific symptoms, presumptive biological mechanism of GI infection, prognosis, clinical management and public health related concerns on the possible risk of oral-fecal transmission. Expert opinion: Different clues point to a direct virus infection and replication in mucosal cells of the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 could enters into the gastrointestinal epithelial cells by the Angiotensin-Converting enzyme 2 membrane receptor. These findings, coupled with identification of viral RNA found in stools of patients, clearly suggest that a direct involvement of gastrointestinal tract is very likely. This can justify most of the gastrointestinal symptoms but also suggest a risk for an oral fecal route for transmission, additionally or alternatively to the main respiratory route.","Simona, Deidda; Lorena, Tora; Davide, Firinu; Stefano, Del Giacco; Marcello, Campagna; Federico, Meloni; Germano, Orrù; Luchino, Chessa; Giovanni, Carta Mauro; Melis, Alessandra; Gaya, Spolverato; Luigi, Zorcolo; Angelo, Restivo",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17474124.2020.1821653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32955375/,150

143338,Respiratory changes with seizures in localization-related epilepsy: analysis of periictal hypercapnia and airflow patterns.,2010,"UNLABELLED This study aimed to estimate the radiation absorbed doses to normal tissues and tumor lesions during radioimmunotherapy with (177)Lu-cG250. Serial planar scintigrams after injection of (111)In-cG250 or (177)Lu-cG250 in patients with metastasized renal cell carcinoma were analyzed quantitatively. The estimated radiation doses were correlated with observed hematologic toxicity. In addition, the accuracy of the predicted therapeutic absorbed doses, based on diagnostic (111)In-cG250 data, were determined. METHODS Twenty patients received a diagnostic tracer activity of (111)In-cG250 (185 MBq), followed by radioimmunotherapy with (177)Lu-cG250. The administered activity of (177)Lu-cG250 was escalated by entering 3 patients at each activity level starting at 1,110 MBq/m(2), with increments of 370 MBq/m(2). After each diagnostic and therapeutic administration, whole-body scintigraphic images and pharmacokinetic data were acquired. Hematologic toxicity was graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0. Diagnostic (111)In-cG250 data were used to simulate (177)Lu and (90)Y data by correcting for the difference in physical decay. Absorbed doses were calculated for the whole body, red marrow, organs, and tumor metastases for the therapeutic (177)Lu-cG250, simulated (177)Lu-cG250, and simulated (90)Y-cG250 data. RESULTS Observed hematologic toxicity, especially platelet toxicity, correlated significantly with the administered activity (r = 0.85), whole-body absorbed dose (r = 0.65), and red marrow dose (r = 0.62 and 0.75). An inverse relationship between the mass and absorbed dose of the tumor lesions was observed. Calculated mean absorbed doses were similar for the simulated and measured (177)Lu-cG250 data. Absorbed doses (whole body and red marrow) based on the simulated (177)Lu-cG250 data correlated with the observed platelet toxicity (r = 0.65 and 0.82). The tumor-to-red marrow dose ratio was higher for radioimmunotherapy with (177)Lu-cG250 than for radioimmunotherapy with (90)Y-cG250, indicating that (177)Lu has a wider therapeutic window for radioimmunotherapy with cG250 than (90)Y. CONCLUSION In patients with metastasized renal cell carcinoma, hematologic toxicity after treatment with (177)Lu-cG250 can be predicted on the basis of administered activity and whole-body and red marrow-absorbed dose. Diagnostic (111)In-cG250 data can be used to accurately predict absorbed doses and myelotoxicity of radioimmunotherapy with (177)Lu-cG250. These estimations indicate that in these patients, higher radiation doses can be guided to the tumors with (177)Lu-cG250 than with (90)Y-cG250.","Stillebroer, Alexander B; Zegers, Catharina M L; Boerman, Otto C; Oosterwijk, Egbert; Mulders, Peter F A; O'Donoghue, Joseph A; Visser, Eric P; Oyen, Wim J G","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.111.094896; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22159179/,150

Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and China Biology Medicine were searched up to March 1, 2020. Randomized controlled clinical trials of urate lowering therapy in hyperuricemia patients were included in meta-analysis. Effect size was estimated as mean difference with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Our search yielded 7 eligible trials with 503 participants. This meta-analysis showed that uric acid-lowering therapy decreased fasting insulin -1.43 µIU/ml (weighted mean differences (WMD, 95% CI -2.78 to -0.09), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance -0.65 (WMD, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.24), systolic blood pressure -2.45 mm Hg (WMD, 95%CI -4.57 to -0.33) and diastolic blood pressure -3.41 mm Hg (WMD, 95%CI -3.87 to -2.95). However, the treatment had no significant effect on fasting plasma glucose (WMD -0.19 mmol/L, 95%CI -0.42 to 0.05), homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function index (WMD -0.02, 95%CI -0.28 to 0.24), total cholesterol (WMD 0.18 mg/dl; 95%CI, -1.39 to 1.75) and triglyceride (WMD 3.15 mg/dl, 95% CI -9.83 to 16.14).

This article examines risk management and risk perception regarding pediatric vaccinations through an analysis of online content shared by Italian vaccine hesitancy movements between December of 2019 and April of 2020. Results show that these movements carry out a reinterpretation of risk, scientific evidence, and parental responsibility, especially with regard to the alleged correlation between the measles vaccine and autism. The limitations of political decisions surrounding vaccines are due to the application of punitive measures such as administrative penalties and licensing bans for doctors who express ""anti-vax"" ideas, aspects which may increase distrust towards the political establishment and the medical profession.","Sbocchia, Valentina",Salud colectiva,https://doi.org/10.18294/sc.2021.3231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33822544/,150

In this study, we quantified how levels of these antibodies change in the months after SARS-CoV-2 infection by examining longitudinal samples collected approximately 30-152 days after symptom onset from a prospective cohort of 32 recovered individuals with asymptomatic, mild, or moderate-severe disease. Neutralizing antibody titers declined an average of about 4-fold from 1 to 4 months after symptom onset. This decline in neutralizing antibody titers was accompanied by a decline in total antibodies capable of binding the viral spike protein or its receptor-binding domain. Importantly, our data are consistent with the expected early immune response to viral infection, where an initial peak in antibody levels is followed by a decline to a lower plateau. Additional studies of long-lived B cells and antibody titers over longer time frames are necessary to determine the durability of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.","Crawford, Katharine H D; Dingens, Adam S; Eguia, Rachel; Wolf, Caitlin R; Wilcox, Naomi; Logue, Jennifer K; Shuey, Kiel; Casto, Amanda M; Fiala, Brooke; Wrenn, Samuel; Pettie, Deleah; King, Neil P; Greninger, Alexander L; Chu, Helen Y; Bloom, Jesse D",The Journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33535236/,150
143842,Coil embolization of traumatic pseudoaneurysm of right internal thoracic artery.,2015,"Background ""Chimney"" techniques with parallel grafts used in order to extend the landing zones in endovascular aneurysm repair (ch-EVAR) are increasingly being reported. Conflicting data has been reported regarding the success and durability of the repair. We report a single center experience using ch-EVAR in treating complex aortic pathologies. Methods We performed a retrospective review of all patients treated with ch-EVAR in our institution between 2013 and 2017. Data collected included patients demographics, indications for surgery, configuration of parallel grafts, technical success, and perioperative morbidity and mortality. Follow-up data included aortic sac size, reintervention rate, and overall mortality. Results Thirty-five patients underwent treatment of their aneurysms with parallel grafts. Sixty parallel grafts were placed. Mean age was 75 years (range 59-93) and 30 (85%) were male. Technical success was achieved in 32 (91%) patients. Mean follow up was 12 months. Sac size decreased in diameter or remained unchanged in 26 of the 30 (86.6%) patients. Four patients were found to have enlarging aneurysms due to gutter endoleaks. All were treated successfully with endovascular methods. The estimated primary patency was 95% at 12 months. Probability of freedom from intervention was 75% at 12 months. No late aneurysm related mortality occurred. Conclusion The use of ch-EVAR in treating complex aortic aneurysms is technically feasible and safe. Gutter endoleaks are encountered only in a minority of the cases, and can be treated with minimally invasive techniques. Longer term follow up is required to evaluate the patency of these parallel grafts and the durability of the aneurysm exclusion.","Silverberg, Daniel; Rimon, Uri; Raskin, Daniel; BarDayan, Avner; Halak, Moshe",Vascular,https://doi.org/10.1177/1708538118761736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29504487/,150
144252,Drug Discovery Targeting COVID-19.,2020-12-01,"Chinese chive (Allium tuberosum) is widely cultivated around the world for its unique flavor, nutrient, and medicinal values, yet its molecular mechanism on flavor formation and other metabolic pathways remains intangible. The elucidation of these complex processes begins with investigating the expression of the genes of interest, however the appropriate reference genes (RGs) for normalizing the gene expression are still unavailable in A. tuberosum. To fill this lacuna, transcriptome-wide screening was undertaken to identify the most stable genes according to the analysis of their FPKM values. The expression stability of the RGs was further evaluated using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder algorithms. The comprehensive analysis showed that GLY1 and SKP1, instead of two traditionally used RGs (eIF1α and ACT2), were the most stable genes across diverse A. tuberosum tissues, indicating the necessity to carefully validate the stability of RGs prior to their use for normalizations. As indicated by geNorm, the normalizations with at least two RGs could give more accurate results. qRT-PCR experiments were conducted with randomly selected genes, demonstrating that normalization with a combination of GLY1 and SKP1 resulted in reliable normalization results. Our finding represents the first attempt toward establishing a standardized qRT-PCR analysis in this economically important vegetable.","Tong, Jing; Hu, Manman; Han, Beibei; Ji, Yanhai; Wang, Baoju; Liang, Hao; Liu, Mingchi; Wu, Zhanhui; Liu, Ning",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95849-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400673/,150

144637,Influence of Molecular Design on the Targeting Properties of ABD-Fused Mono- and Bi-Valent Anti-HER3 Affibody Therapeutic Constructs.,2018,"INTRODUCTION A number of studies have reported an association between peripheral hearing impairment, central auditory processing and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its preclinical stages. Both peripheral hearing impairment and central auditory processing disorders are observed many years prior to the clinical manifestation of AD symptoms, hence, providing a long window of opportunity to investigate potential interventions against neurodegenerative processes. This paper outlines the protocol for a systematic review of studies examining the central auditory processing functions in AD and its preclinical stages, investigated through behavioural (clinical assessments that require active participation) central auditory processing tests. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will use the keywords and Medical Subject Heading terms to search the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE and CINAHL Plus. Studies including assessments of central auditory function in adults diagnosed with dementia, AD and its preclinical stages that were published before 8 May 2019 will be reviewed. This review protocol will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols guidelines. Data analysis and search results will be reported in the full review. This manuscript has designed the protocols for a systematic review that will identify the behavioural clinical central auditory processing measures that are sensitive to the changes in auditory function in adults with AD and its preclinical stages. Such assessments may subsequently help to design studies to examine the potential impact of hearing and communication rehabilitation of individuals at risk of AD. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required as this manuscript only reports the protocols for conducting a systematic review as primary data will only be reviewed and not be collected. The results of this systematic review will be disseminated through publication and in scientific conferences.

METHODS Our endoscopic technique comprises an extended inferomedial maxillectomy, mobilization of the pterygopalatine fossa, removal of the pterygoid plates and Eustachian tube to access the posterolateral nasopharynx. Control of the parapharyngeal and petrous segments of the internal carotid artery is the keystone of the approach. RESULTS Various histopathologies were treated, including epidermoid carcinomas (n = 9), lymphoepithelioma (n = 1), adenoid cystic carcinoma (n = 5), adenocarcinoma (n = 2), mucoepidermoid carcinoma (n = 2), and sarcoma (n = 1). Negative microscopic margins were obtained in 95% (19/20) of patients. No perioperative mortality, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak, meningitis, or cerebrovascular accident was encountered; however, one patient suffered an internal carotid artery (ICA) injury, without permanent sequelae. All but one patient received adjuvant therapy (external and/or stereotactic radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy). Follow-up ranged from 15 to 68 months (mean = 33). Overall survival was 45% (9/20) and local control was 65% (13/20). CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic transpterygoid nasopharyngectomy for primary and recurrent nasopharyngeal malignancies is feasible and safe in properly selected patients. Preliminary outcomes compare to that of conventional techniques. Endoscopic resections, however, are demanding; they require specialized equipment and a team versed in endoscopic oncologic surgery.

Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)7 are two recently discovered urinary biomarkers for AKI. We now report on the development, and diagnostic accuracy of two clinical cutoffs for a test using these markers. METHODS We derived cutoffs based on sensitivity and specificity for prediction of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Stages 2-3 AKI within 12 h using data from a previously published multicenter cohort (Sapphire). Next, we verified these cutoffs in a new study (Opal) enrolling 154 critically ill adults from six sites in the USA. RESULTS One hundred subjects (14%) in Sapphire and 27 (18%) in Opal met the primary end point. The results of the Opal study replicated those of Sapphire. Relative risk (95% CI) in both studies for subjects testing at ≤0.3 versus >0.3-2 were 4.7 (1.5-16) and 4.4 (2.5-8.7), or 12 (4.2-40) and 18 (10-37) for ≤0.3 versus >2. For the 0.3 cutoff, sensitivity was 89% in both studies, and specificity 50 and 53%. For 2.0, sensitivity was 42 and 44%, and specificity 95 and 90%.

But the mechanism for such protection is not clear. Here, we report that in damaged proximal tubules of high-fat diet-fed ApoE-knockout mice, a model of non-proteinuric DKD, ATP production shifted from lipolysis to ketolysis dependent due to hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). We further found that empagliflozin raised endogenous ketone body (KB) levels, and thus its use or treatment with 1,3-butanediol, a KB precursor, prevented decreases in renal ATP levels and organ damage in the mice. The renoprotective effect of empagliflozin was abolished by gene deletion of Hmgcs2, a rate-limiting enzyme of ketogenesis. Furthermore, KBs attenuated mTORC1-associated podocyte damage and proteinuria in diabetic db/db mice. Our findings show that SGLT2 inhibition-associated renoprotection is mediated by an elevation of KBs that in turn corrects mTORC1 hyperactivation that occurs in non-proteinuric and proteinuric DKD.","Tomita, Issei; Kume, Shinji; Sugahara, Sho; Osawa, Norihisa; Yamahara, Kosuke; Yasuda-Yamahara, Mako; Takeda, Naoko; Chin-Kanasaki, Masami; Kaneko, Tatsuroh; Mayoux, Eric; Mark, Michael; Yanagita, Motoko; Ogita, Hisakazu; Araki, Shin-Ichi; Maegawa, Hiroshi",Cell metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2020.06.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726607/,150

OBJECTIVE We evaluated whether cumulative proton pump inhibitor dose is associated with the diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia while controlling for multiple variables. METHODS We retrospectively identified patients who underwent upper endoscopy with gastric biopsy between 2005 and 2014. Covariate data retrieved included age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, Helicobacter pylori status (based on clarithromycin-amoxicillin-proton pump inhibitor issued), cumulative proton pump inhibitor issued within 10 years (quartiles (PPI-Q1-4) of daily drug dose), anti-parietal cell antibodies, body mass index and comorbidity index. RESULTS Of the 14,147 included patients (median age 63.4 years; women 54.4%; Helicobacter pylori-positive 29.0%), 1244 (8.8%) had gastric intestinal metaplasia. Increasing age, Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, anti-parietal cell antibodies and proton pump inhibitor use were all associated with the diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia. Upper quartiles of cumulative proton pump inhibitor doses (PPI-Q4 and PPI-Q3 vs. PPI-Q1) were associated with the diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia: adjusted odds ratios 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.57) and 1.27 (95% CI 1.07-1.52), respectively, for the whole cohort (Ptotal 0.007, Ptrend 0.013), 1.69 (95% CI 1.23-2.33) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.04-1.89), respectively, for Helicobacter pylori-positive patients (Ptotal 0.004, Ptrend 0.005) and 1.21 (95% CI 0.98-1.49) and 1.20 (95% CI 0.96-1.49), respectively, for Helicobacter pylori-negative patients (Ptotal 0.288, Ptrend 0.018). Upper quartiles of proton pump inhibitor dose were associated with a 5-10-fold increased risk of low-grade dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS Among Helicobacter pylori-positive patients, proton pump inhibitor use appears to be associated with a dose-dependent increased likelihood of gastric intestinal metaplasia.","Snir, Yifat; Leibovitzh, Haim; Leibovici-Weissman, Yaara; Vilkin, Alex; Cohen, Arnon D; Shochat, Tzippy; Niv, Yaron; Dotan, Iris; Feldhamer, Ilan; Boltin, Doron; Levi, Zohar",United European gastroenterology journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2050640620951403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962566/,150

BACKGROUND In 2015, the MERS epidemic struck Korea, and ill-prepared nurses had to care for patients with MERS. Nurses experienced conflict between their fear of the disease and their work and professional ethic. DESIGN We employed a phenomenological qualitative approach. METHODS Inductive, qualitative, in-depth interviews were performed with 17 nurses. The study process followed the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist. RESULTS The qualitative inductive content analysis generated seven theme cluster and 18 themes. The theme clusters were ""Fear of Uncertainty"", ""Beyond Hesitation"", ""A Scene Like a Battlefield"", ""Chaotic Nursing Identity"", ""Buttresses for Sustainability"", ""Lingering Trauma"" and ""Expanded Horizon of Nursing"". The final analysis revealed that the core theme was ""Beyond the fear of uncertainty"". CONCLUSIONS This study contrives a more in-depth, holistic understanding by describing the experiences of nurses who directly cared for patients with MERS-the first large-scale infectious disease in Korea. Although nurses saw themselves as vital caregivers, they were frightened of the disease, had to work in a harsh environment, experienced various internal conflicts, and had to deal with varying forms of uncertainty. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE This study sheds light on the nursing situation during crises involving serious infectious diseases; to combat these, more medical facilities are needed, and staff should be proactively guided on how to care for patients. It can serve as part of a good foundation for further study of medical staff during recurring epidemics.","Lee, Jin Young; Hong, Jung Hee; Park, Eun Young",Journal of clinical nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32498126/,150

149639,Highly efficient photothermal conversion capric acid phase change microcapsule: Silicon carbide modified melamine urea formaldehyde.,2020-08-05,"Introduction CoenzymeQ10 (CoQ10) is a well-known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent with cardioprotective properties. However, clinical trials based on its oral administration have failed to provide significant effect on cardiac functionality. The main limitation of CoQ10 is based on its very low oral bioavailability and instability that limit dramatically its effects as a cardioprotective agent. Herein, we loaded CoQ10 in high bioavailable nano-emulsions (NEs) coated with chitosan or chitosan and hyaluronic acid in order to improve its performance. Methods We tested cardioprotective and hepatoprotective effects of CoQ10-loaded nano-carriers against Doxorubicin and Trastuzumab toxicities in cardiomyocytes and liver cells through analysis of cell viability, lipid peroxidation, expression of leukotrienes, p65/NF-kB and pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in anticancer-induced cardio and hepatotoxicity. Results Nano-carriers showed high stability and loading ability and increased cell viability both in hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes during anticancer treatments. We observed that these effects are mediated by the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and reduction of the inflammation. CoQ10-loaded nano-emulsions showed also strong anti-inflammatory effects reducing leukotriene B4 and p65/NF-κB expression and Interleukin 1β and 6 production during anticancer treatments. Discussion Anthracyclines and Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) inhibitors have shown significant anticancer effects in clinical practice but their use is characterized by cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Nano-carriers loaded with CoQ10 showed cardio and hepatoprotective properties mediated by reduction of oxidative damages and pro-inflammatory mediators. These results set the stage for preclinical studies of cardio and hepatoprotection in HER2+ breast cancer-bearing mice treated with Doxorubicin and Trastuzumab.","Quagliariello, Vincenzo; Vecchione, Raffaele; De Capua, Alberta; Lagreca, Elena; Iaffaioli, Rosario Vincenzo; Botti, Gerardo; Netti, Paolo A; Maurea, Nicola",International journal of nanomedicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s245170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764923/,150

The trends which dominate include the efforts to develop effective point of care tests and implantable/wearable technologies for early diagnosis and continuous monitoring. This review will outline the current state of the art in a number of relevant fields, including device engineering, chemistry, nanoscience and biomolecular detection, and suggest how these advances might be employed to develop effective systems for measuring physiology, detecting infection and monitoring biomarker status in wild animals. Special consideration is also given to the emerging threat of antimicrobial resistance and in the light of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, zoonotic infections. Both of these areas involve significant crossover between animal and human health and are therefore well placed to seed technological developments with applicability to both human and animal health and, more generally, the reviewed technologies have significant potential to find use in the measurement of physiology in wild animals.

In fact, esophagojejunostomy is the most difficult surgical technique in TLTG. We adopted functional end-to-end anastomosis for esophagojejunostomy to simplify the procedure. The present study assesses the feasibility and surgical outcomes of TLTG with functional end-to-end esophagojejunostomy. METHODS We assessed the intraoperative and postoperative outcomes of 65 consecutive patients who underwent TLTG with functional end-to-end esophagojejunostomy at Tonan Hospital between January 2006 and August 2011. RESULTS The mean surgical duration was 271.5 ± 64.7 min, and the mean blood loss was 85.2 ± 143.2 g. One patient (1.5 %) was converted to open surgery, and two patients (3.1 %) required reoperation due to ileus because of an internal hernia and jejunojejunostomy leakage. No reoperation was associated with functional end-to-end esophagojejunostomy. The mean hospital stay was 21.4 ± 13.5 days. Ten patients (15.4 %) developed postoperative complications, of which three (4.6 %) were anastomotic stenosis associated with functional end-to-end esophagojejunostomy. All of these were resolved by endoscopic dilation. CONCLUSION Functional end-to-end esophagojejunostomy in TLTG is safe and feasible.","Ebihara, Yuma; Okushiba, Shunichi; Kawarada, Yo; Kitashiro, Shuji; Katoh, Hiroyuki",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-013-1051-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23354359/,150

(2) To report differences in knowledge between fathers and non-fathers. (3) To examine factors associated with men's greater knowledge. METHODS Participants were men (N = 1303) aged 18 to 35 years responding to a cross-sectional survey that was administered to a national panel established through probability sampling of the civilian, non-institutionalized US population. Survey weights allow reporting of nationally representative analyses. RESULTS Participants (mean age = 27; 58% white, 36% fathers) correctly answered 52% of the infant knowledge questions. Fathers and non-fathers answered 64% and 46% of the items correctly, respectively. The difference in knowledge between fathers and non-fathers was statistically significant (B = 0.16, p < .001). The subscale with the highest number of correct responses was routines (80% accuracy), followed by discipline (59% accuracy), safety (52% accuracy), sleep (51% accuracy), development (50% accuracy), and nutrition (40% accuracy). Multivariate analyses showed that depressive symptoms (B = -0.07, p < .05) were associated with lower infant knowledge, while higher education (B = 0.06, p < .05) and current employment (B = 0.06, p < .01) were associated with higher infant knowledge.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2011 to April 2014, seven patients (5 females and 2 males; mean age 51.4) with 11 renal AMLs (9 sporadic type and 2 tuberous sclerosis associated) with a mean size of 3.4 ± 0.7 cm (range 2.4-4.9 cm) were treated with high-powered, gas-cooled percutaneous MW ablation under US guidance. Tumoral diameter, volume, and CT/MR enhancement were measured on pre-treatment, immediate post-ablation, and delayed post-ablation imaging. Clinical symptoms and creatinine were assessed on follow-up visits. RESULTS All ablations were technically successful and no major complications were encountered. Mean ablation parameters were ablation power of 65 W (range 60-70 W), using 456 mL of hydrodissection fluid per patient, over 4.7 min (range 3-8 min). Immediate post-ablation imaging demonstrated mean tumor diameter and volume decreases of 1.8% (3.4-3.3 cm) and 1.7% (27.5-26.3 cm(3)), respectively. Delayed imaging follow-up obtained at a mean interval of 23.1 months (median 17.6; range 9-47) demonstrated mean tumor diameter and volume decreases of 29% (3.4-2.4 cm) and 47% (27.5-12.1 cm(3)), respectively. Tumoral enhancement decreased on immediate post-procedure and delayed imaging by CT/MR parameters, indicating decreased tumor vascularity. No patients required additional intervention and no patients experienced spontaneous bleeding post-ablation. CONCLUSION Our early experience with high-powered, gas-cooled percutaneous MW ablation demonstrates it to be a safe and effective modality to devascularize and decrease the size of renal AMLs.","Cristescu, Mircea; Abel, E Jason; Wells, Shane; Ziemlewicz, Timothy J; Hedican, Sean P; Lubner, Megan G; Hinshaw, J Louis; Brace, Christopher L; Lee, Fred T",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-015-1201-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26390876/,150

Hoarding is also a normative human behavior within certain contexts, including the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, when individuals became panicked about the availability of products such as toilet paper and antibacterial wipes. Previous research suggests that personality traits and personality disorder symptoms may be linked with hoarding behaviors. The purpose of this review is to provide a snapshot of recent research on hoarding and personality. RECENT FINDINGS Most recent research on this topic has focused on hoarding behaviors as the action of stockpiling goods during a pandemic. Research on this area was mixed with regard to extraversion and openness but was strongly suggestive of a link between stockpiling behaviors and increased neuroticism. Hoarding in the context of OCD was linked with lower levels of both extraversion and conscientiousness. Patients with hoarding disorder almost universally have clinically elevated levels of personality disorder traits. SUMMARY The directions of observed associations between five-factor model personality traits and hoarding behaviors differ across diagnostic and geographic contexts. Additional research is needed with participants who meet diagnostic criteria for hoarding disorder.","Dozier, Mary E; DeShong, Hilary L",Current opinion in psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0000000000000754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34620755/,150

OBJECTIVES To investigate perceived comfort in communication about end-of-life and palliative care among healthcare providers in Nairobi, Kenya and to evaluate a pilot webinar-based communication training series. METHODS Through a partnership with a research hospital in Nairobi, healthcare providers engaged an online survey to assess perceived comfort in communication and prior educational training in communication. The COMFORT communication model was used to develop and pilot a webinar-based communication training series to meet training needs. Pre-post measures of comfort in communication and post-curriculum evaluation were used to evaluate the webinars. RESULTS Survey findings from 94 healthcare providers demonstrated that communication training is most needed when patient/family culture is different from provider. Physicians reported less comfort in communication than nurses and other professionals, especially in communication with family about spiritual or religious concerns. Nurses reported more overall training in palliative care communication topics than physicians and other disciplines. The 3-part webinar series increased communication comfort for physicians and nurses, was highly rated, and participants reported that they would recommend COMFORT webinar training to colleagues. CONCLUSION Webinar-based platforms for communication training show promise for meeting communication training needs of healthcare providers.","Wittenberg, Elaine; Alabere, Regina Ogechi; Beltran, Emeline; Goldsmith, Joy V; Moledina, Shabnam",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1177/10499091211026673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34159800/,150

This study describes the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children with cancer or hematologic disorders treated at a large children's hospital. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Center from January 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020. All patients with a primary hematology-oncology diagnosis and SARS-CoV-2 positivity by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were identified. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical record. Descriptive analyses were performed to evaluate COVID-19-related outcomes and risk factors for severe disease in this population. We identified 109 patients with COVID-19 disease, including 52 hematology, 51 oncology, and 6 HSCT patients; median age was 10.3 years (IQR 4.4-15.9), and 58.7% were male. Seventy-four percent of the patients were managed in the outpatient setting. Patients with sickle cell disease were more likely to require hospitalization. ICU care was needed in 8% (n = 9) of the entire cohort, and mechanical ventilation was required in 6.4% (6 oncology patients, 1 hematology patient). COVID-19 contributed to the deaths of two cancer patients. No deaths occurred in hematology or HSCT patients. In conclusion, the risk of severe COVID-19 complications is slightly higher in pediatric hematology-oncology patients than in the general pediatric population but lower than initially feared. For most asymptomatic patients, primary disease management may continue as planned, but treatment decisions must be individualized.","Kamdar, Kala Y; Kim, Taylor O; Doherty, Erin E; Pfeiffer, Thomas M; Qasim, Shawki L; Suell, Mary Nell; Yates, Amber M; Blaney, Susan M",Pediatric hematology and oncology,https://doi.org/10.1080/08880018.2021.1924327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34032552/,150

Herein, we report that the spiky nanostructures with matched topography to the influenza A virus (IAV) virions could be used to design next-generation advanced virus inhibitors. We demonstrated that nanostructures with spikes between 5 and 10 nm bind significantly better to virions than smooth nanoparticles, due to the short spikes inserting into the gaps of glycoproteins of the IAV virion. Furthermore, an erythrocyte membrane (EM) was coated to target the IAV, and the obtained EM-coated nanostructures could efficiently prevent IAV virion binding to the cells and inhibit subsequent infection. In a postinfection study, the EM-coated nanostructures reduced >99.9% virus replication at the cellular nontoxic dosage. We predict that such a combination of geometry-matching topography and cellular membrane coating will also push forward the development of nanoinhibitors for other virus strains, including SARS-CoV-2.","Nie, Chuanxiong; Stadtmüller, Marlena; Yang, Hua; Xia, Yi; Wolff, Thorsten; Cheng, Chong; Haag, Rainer",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c01723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32515974/,150

The study was revisited using a penalty score based on the recently developed mean absolute dose deviation (MADD). METHODS Eight patients with a unique combination of laterality, nodal coverage, and surgery underwent dual tomotherapy and CR treatment planning in both prone and supine positions, providing 32 distinct combinations. The penalty score was applied using the weighted sum of the MADDs. The Lenth method for unreplicated 2-level factorial design was used in the analysis. RESULTS The Lenth analysis identified nodal irradiation as the active main effect penalizing the dosimetry by 1.14 Gy (P = 0.001). Other significant effects were left laterality (0.94 Gy), mastectomy (0.61 Gy), and interactions between left mastectomy (0.89 Gy) and prone mastectomy (0.71 Gy), with P-values between 0.005 and 0.05. Tomotherapy provided a small reduction in penalty (reduction of 0.54 Gy) through interaction with nodal irradiation (P = 0.080). Some effects approached significance with P-values > 0.05 and ≤ 0.10 for interactions of prone × mastectomy × left (0.60 Gy), nodal irradiation × mastectomy (0.59 Gy), and prone × left (0.55 Gy) and the main effect prone (0.52 Gy). CONCLUSIONS The historical dosimetric analysis previously revealed the feasibility of tomotherapy, but a conclusion could not be made. The MADD-based score is promising, and a new analysis highlights the impact of factors and hierarchy of priorities that need to be addressed if major gains are to be attained.","Heymann, Steve; Dipasquale, Giovanna; Nguyen, Nam P; San, Meymey; Gorobets, Olena; Leduc, Nicolas; Verellen, Dirk; Storme, Guy; Van Parijs, Hilde; De Ridder, Mark; Vinh-Hung, Vincent",Technology in cancer research & treatment,https://doi.org/10.1177/1533033820947759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940569/,150

154490,Anatomy Revisited: Hemodialysis Catheter Malposition into the Chest.,2019,"PURPOSE To evaluate the outcomes of carotid artery stenting (CAS) with Wallstents in a single-center experience. METHODS From January 2003 to December 2013, 1000 carotid artery lesions were treated with Carotid Wallstents under cerebral protection in 877 patients (mean age 71.7 ± 8 years; 621 men). Indications for treatment were de novo lesions (>70% asymptomatic and >60% symptomatic); stenoses following carotid endarterectomy, radiation, or neck surgery; contralateral laryngeal nerve palsy; and high surgical risk. All the patients underwent duplex ultrasound and clinical evaluation during follow-up; radiography was performed when fracture or stent migration was suggested by ultrasound. RESULTS Procedure success was achieved in 99.3% of patients. Major and minor 30-day adverse events occurred in 2.1% of patients, including stroke (1.8%: 1.3% minor, 0.5% major), myocardial infarction (0.1%), and death (0.2%). Plaque morphology, nature of stenosis, and symptomatic status were significantly associated with the risk of postoperative neurologic events. Restenosis occurred in 3.2% at a mean 45.5-month follow-up and was significantly associated with diabetes, smoking, symptomatic stenosis, de novo stenosis, and calcification (plaque III/IV). No fracture or migration was registered during follow-up. CONCLUSION CAS is a valid method for treating carotid artery disease, with very low rates of major adverse events and neurologic complications. The Carotid Wallstent seems to have excellent results, even with complex plaque morphology, and a low incidence of restenosis at follow-up.","Ronchey, Sonia; Praquin, Barbara; Orrico, Matteo; Serrao, Eugenia; Ciceroni, Cristina; Alberti, Vittorio; Fazzini, Stefano; Mangialardi, Nicola",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602815626558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26802612/,150
154808,Bio-organism sensing via surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy on controlled metal/polymer nanostructured substrates.,2009,"BACKGROUND Atopic eczema (AE) is a common relapsing inflammatory skin disease in children which is often associated with chronicity and poor quality of life. Unlike atopic asthma, control of AE is seldom assessed in therapeutics. AIM To investigate the utility of a Traffic Light Control (TLC) system as a measurement/assessment of self-perceived eczema control. METHODS This is a prospectively study of all Chinese children (aged 6 to 18 years old) with eczema attending the paediatric dermatology clinic of a tertiary hospital from Jan to June 2020. Eczema control, eczema severity, quality of life and biophysical skin condition of consecutive patients at the paediatric dermatology clinic of a teaching hospital were evaluated with the validated Chinese versions of Depressive, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS-21), Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and stratum corneum skin hydration (SH), respectively. With a visual TLC analogy, patients were asked if their eczema is under control (green light), worsening (yellow) or in flare-up (red light). RESULTS Among AE patients (n = 36), self-perceived TLC as green (under control), amber (worsening) and red (flare up) reflected acute and chronic severity (SCORAD, NESS, POEM) and quality of life (CDLQI) (p< 0.0001), but not SH, TEWL or Depression, anxiety and stress. CONCLUSIONS Eczema control can be semi-quantified with a child-friendly TLC self-assessment system. AE patients reporting worse eczema control have worse acute and chronic eczema severity, more impairment of quality of life; but not the psychologic symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress or skin hydration or transepidermal water loss. TLC can be linked to an eczema action plan to guide patient management.","Lam, P H; Hon, K L; Leung, Kky; Leong, Kin Fon; Li, C K; Leung, T F",The Journal of dermatological treatment,https://doi.org/10.1080/09546634.2020.1826395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962454/,150
155014,Hydrothermal Duodenal Mucosal Resurfacing: Role in the Treatment of Metabolic Disease.,2017,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a severe infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that binds to the cells; angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. In the first severe case of COVID-19 in Shenzhen city, we found that in addition to the typical clinical manifestations, our patient presented hemoptysis, refractory hypoxemia and pulmonary fibrosis-like changes on computed tomography (CT) involving alveoli and pulmonary interstitium in the early stage and acute pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure in the later stage, which were not completely justified by myocarditis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary fibrosis and high PEEP level. The lung compliance deterioration of this patient was not as serious as we expected, indicating classic ARDS was not existed. Simultaneously, the first autopsy report of COVID-19 in China showed normal-structured alveoli and massive thick excretion in the airway. Then, we speculated that the virus not only attacked alveolar epithelial cells, but also affected pulmonary vascular endothelial cells. Imbalance in the ACE2-RAAS- bradykinin axis and the cytokine storm could be an important mechanism leading to pathophysiological changes in pulmonary vascular and secondary refractory hypoxemia. Pulmonary vasculitis or capillaritis associated to immune damage and an inflammatory storm could exist in COVID-19 because of ground-glass opacities in the subpleural area, which are similar to connective tissue disease associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD). Thus, this case elucidates new treatment measures for COVID-19.","Wang, Xinxin; Tu, Yunliang; Huang, Bin; Li, Yinfeng; Li, Yanyan; Zhang, Sheng; Lin, Yingxin; Huang, Lei; Zhang, Weixing; Luo, Hua",Cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy,https://doi.org/10.21037/cdt-20-429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32968645/,150

This study aims to analyze the efficacy and safety of the 5-mm and 10-mm devices. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Patients who received a laparoscopic or hand-assisted laparoscopic operation for a tumor located in the sigmoid colon or rectum since 2006 were abstracted from a prospectively designed database, and findings were analyzed in two groups based on size of the device used during the procedure. The videotapes of the procedures were watched, and operation reports were read to obtain further information on specific intra- and postoperative complications. Demographics, tumor and operation-related information, and postoperative data were compared. RESULTS Among 215 (128 [59.5%] males; median age, 59.5±13.8 years) patients, data obtained from the 5-mm (n=32) and 10-mm (n=183) groups were identical regarding demographics and data related to tumor (localization and stage) and operation (number of harvested lymph nodes, conversion rates, operation time, intraoperative bleeding, transfusion requirement, reoperation rates, complications, 30-day mortality, and length of hospital stay). However, more patients underwent an anterior resection in the 10-mm group than in the 5-mm group (31.7% versus 15.6%, P<.05). Further analyses found device-related bleeding in 8 (3.7%) cases (2 [6.3%] versus 6 [3.3%] in the 5-mm versus 10-mm group, respectively, P>.05), requiring further attempts for hemorrhage control (n=6), conversion to open surgery (n=1), or relaparotomy (n=1). CONCLUSIONS The 5-mm and 10-mm LigaSure devices are similarly effective and safe during laparoscopic sigmoid colon and rectal resections. Severe bleeding from larger vessels may be observed, requiring conversion to open surgery or relaparotomy.","Gezen, Cem; Kement, Metin; Altuntas, Yunus E; Aksakal, Nihat; Okkabaz, Nuri; Civil, Osman; Vural, Selahattin; Oncel, Mustafa",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Our Institution, Piedmont's largest tertiary referral center, was designated as a non-COVID-19 hospital and activities were reorganized to prioritize critical services like oncological care. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy in preserving the oncological surgical practice at our Institution during the most critical months of the COVID-19 epidemic by analyzing the surgical pathology activity. METHODS The number of oncological surgical resections submitted to histopathological examination from 9th March 2020 to 8th May 2020 were collected as well staging/grading data and compared with the previous three pre-COVID-19 years (2017-2019). RESULTS Overall, no decrease was observed for most tumor sites (5/9) while breast resections showed the largest drop (109 vs. 160; -31.9%), although a full recovery was already noticed during the second half of the period. Conversely, the selected control benchmarks showed a sharp decrease (-80.4%). Distribution of pathological TNM stages (or tumor grades for central nervous system tumors) showed no significant differences during the lockdown compared with previous years (p > .05).

Simultaneously, an intractable issue appeared: a considerable number of hazardous medical wastes have been generated from the hospitals, clinics, and other health care facilities, constituting a serious threat to public health and environmental sustainability without proper management. Traditional disposal methods like incineration, landfill and autoclaving are unable to reduce environmental burden due to the issues such as toxic gas release, large land occupation, and unsustainability. While the application of clean and safe pyrolysis technology on the medical wastes treatment to produce high-grade bioproducts has the potential to alleviate the situation. Besides, medical wastes are excellent and ideal raw materials, which possess high hydrogen, carbon content and heating value. Consequently, pyrolysis of medical wastes can deal with wastes and generate valuable products like bio-oil and biochar. Consequently, this paper presents a critical and comprehensive review of the pyrolysis of medical wastes.

This is particularly important in the rapidly changing healthcare context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite recognition of its importance in the United Kingdom, minimum required hours for re-registration, and related investment, have been small compared to other countries. The aim of this review is to understand the factors that optimise continuing professional development impact for learning, development and improvement in the workplace. DESIGN A rapid evidence review was undertaken using Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) framework; identifying a research question, developing a search strategy, extracting, collating and summarising the findings. REVIEW METHODS In addressing the question 'What are the factors that enable or optimise CPD impact for learning, development and improvement in the workplace at the individual, team, organisation and system level?' the British Nursing Index, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, HTA database, King's Fund Library, and Medline databases were searched for key terms. A total of 3790 papers were retrieved and 39 were included. RESULTS Key factors to optimising the impact of nursing and inter-professional continuing development are; self-motivation, relevance to practice, preference for workplace learning, strong enabling leadership and a positive workplace culture. The findings reveal the interdependence of these important factors in optimising the impact of continuing professional development on person-centred care and outcomes. CONCLUSION In the current, rapidly changing, healthcare context it is important for educators and managers to understand the factors that enhance the impact of continuing professional development. It is crucial that attention is given to addressing all of the optimising factors in this review to enhance impact. Future studies should seek to measure the value of continuing professional development for people experiencing care, nurses and the wider organisation.","King, Rachel; Taylor, Bethany; Talpur, Ashfaque; Jackson, Carolyn; Manley, Kim; Ashby, Nichola; Tod, Angela; Ryan, Tony; Wood, Emily; Senek, Michaela; Robertson, Steve",Nurse education today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33190952/,150

Methods based on bisulfite sequencing have been proposed for genome-wide 5caC analysis. However, bisulfite-based sequencing of scarcely abundant 5caC demands significant experimental and computational resources, increasing sequencing cost. Here, we present a bisulfite-free approach, caCLEAR, for high-resolution mapping of 5caCGs. The method uses an atypical activity of the methyltransferase eM.SssI to remove a carboxyl group from 5caC, generating unmodified CGs, which are localized by uTOP-seq sequencing. Validation of caCLEAR on model DNA systems and mouse ESCs supports the suitability of caCLEAR for analysis of 5caCGs. The 5caCG profiles of naive and primed pluripotent ESCs reflect their distinct demethylation dynamics and demonstrate an association of 5caC with gene expression. Generally, we demonstrate that caCLEAR is a robust economical approach that could help provide deeper insights into biological roles of 5caC.","Ličytė, Janina; Gibas, Povilas; Skardžiūtė, Kotryna; Stankevičius, Vaidotas; Rukšėnaitė, Audronė; Kriukienė, Edita",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937122/,150

STUDY DESIGN Using a retrospective cohort study design, a statistical study was conducted of 91 patients diagnosed with mucoceles at the Department of Dental and Oral Surgery, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan, between January 2006 and December 2016. The patients' age and sex; shape, size, and site of the lesion; duration; and treatment response rate were evaluated. RESULTS The most frequent site of mucoceles was the lower labial mucosa, and several were <10 mm in size. The age of onset was often <20 years, with no sex-based differences. The treatment response rate was 65.8% for steroid ointment and 100% for surgical removal. In the subgroup analysis according to each clinical factor, some subgroups showed statistically nonsignificant differences compared with the surgery group. Among them, the older age and short disease duration subgroups showed small risk differences, suggesting that application of ointment may lead to a response in these subgroups. CONCLUSIONS Although its response rate was lower than that of surgical removal, topical steroid application is a noninvasive and useful treatment method that can be used for patients in whom surgical treatment is infeasible.","Mori, Keisuke; Uchino, Kaho; Komukai, Sho; Aijima, Reona; Shimohira, Daiji; Danjo, Atsushi; Yamashita, Yoshio","Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2021.04.054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140272/,150

This parameter depends upon the concentration of epithelial cells. Respiratory samples are usually heterogeneous, which makes relative quantification of the viral load, against the quantity of cells, the most suitable measurement. The quantification of viral load in the field of respiratory viruses is a vital piece of information. Quantification is required from RNA or DNA viral genomes extracted. OBJECTIVES To design (RT-)PCR assays for reference genes, which show stable expression during viral infection, to be used as cellular controls and cellular quantification tools. STUDY DESIGN Assays were designed for two reference genes: hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) and ubiquitin C (UBC). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPDH) was used as a reference for this study. The transcriptional activity of the three genes was studied during infection with respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. The HPRT1 q(RT-)PCR assay was used on clinical samples. RESULTS All the analysis methods concluded that the three reference genes were stably expressed during viral infection. The HPRT1 q(RT-)PCR assay indicated that the majority of clinical samples (n=301, 69%) had a cellular load of between 100 and 10,000 cells/PCR. The data showed that the concentration decreased as the age of patient increased.

Primary outcomes were (1) recurrence-a >2-cm defect above the diaphragm at 3 months; (2) intra- and postoperative complications; (3) pre- and postoperative esophageal reflux (GERD) or dysphagia; and (4) cessation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Results Sixty-two patients who had LHHR with UBM mesh were studied (mean age, 62 years, 53 women, mean body mass index 32.7 kg/m2) Before surgery 98% had GERD, 19% had dysphagia, and 98% were on PPI. Postoperative UGIS was performed on 66% 3 months after surgery, and 19% had a recurrence of >2 cm; 56% remained on PPI, and 16% (P < .001) remained symptomatic. Dysphagia improved in 75% (P = .05). No intraoperative complications were recorded. One postoperative mortality occurred secondary to an unrelated cardiac event. Conclusions UBM mesh was effective and safe for LHHR. In addition to reducing the rate of recurrence compared to unreinforced primary repair, the properties of UBM, including site-specific constructive tissue remodeling, may add benefits over other biologic products. This study represents an evaluation of UBM mesh in a large cohort of patients who underwent LHHR.","Zografakis, John; Johnston, Gregory; Haas, Jennifer; Berbiglia, Lindsay; Bedford, Tyler; Spear, Justin; Dan, Adrian; Pozsgay, Mark",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2017.00060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29861621/,150

The health emergency from Covid-19 has seen health workers on the front line face all the difficulties related to the burden of care and the reorganization of procedures, roles, and tools at the hospital level. One of the most significant and probably underestimated aspects is the psychological stress of frontline nurses. The article aims to analyze the literature relating to the impact on the mental health of nurses engaged in the management and care of Covid-19 patients. METHODS A systematic review of the published articles on the subject was conducted from January 2020 to November 2020. The search for papers was conducted on scientific databases like PubMed, Scopus and Embase. RESULTS The results show the onset of anxiety, depression and stress and insomnia in healthcare workers. These aspects are closely related to numerous factors, including the fear of contracting the disease and infecting family members, stressful shifts and little rest, leading to a state of psychological and physical tension capable of activating pathological behaviours. The literature highlights the importance of support interventions for frontline personnel to avoid the onset of psycho-pathophysical severe problems. CONCLUSION The review suggests that frontline nurses during the emergency phase of Covid- 19 may be prone to psychological disorders that can compromise mental health. Therefore, the surveillance and monitoring of symptoms, together with targeted support interventions, should be guaranteed daily to all professionals involved to prevent the onset of psychological disorders.","Ruta, Federico; Dal Mas, Francesca; Biancuzzi, Helena; Ferrara, Paolo; Della Monica, Annalisa",Professioni infermieristiche,https://doi.org/10.7429/pi.2021.741041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34089640/,150

Myocardial steatosis predisposes to diastolic dysfunction, a heart failure precursor. We aimed to characterize myocardial steatosis and associated potential risk factors among a subset of the Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV (REPRIEVE) participants. METHODS Eighty-two PWH without known heart failure successfully underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance spectroscopy, yielding data on intramyocardial triglyceride (IMTG) content (a continuous marker for myocardial steatosis extent). Logistic regression models were applied to investigate associations between select clinical characteristics and odds of increased or markedly increased IMTG content. RESULTS Median (Q1, Q3) IMTG content was 0.59% (0.28%, 1.15%). IMTG content was increased (> 0.5%) among 52% and markedly increased (> 1.5%) among 22% of participants. Parameters associated with increased IMTG content included age (P = .013), body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2 (P = .055), history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) (P = .033), and nadir CD4 count < 350 cells/mm³ (P = .055). Age and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 were additionally associated with increased odds of markedly increased IMTG content (P = .049 and P = .046, respectively). CONCLUSIONS A substantial proportion of antiretroviral therapy-treated PWH exhibited myocardial steatosis. Age, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, low nadir CD4 count, and history of IVDU emerged as possible risk factors for myocardial steatosis in this group.

160201,[Drug therapy or surgical treatment of obesity--for surgical treatment].,2010,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In acute ischemic stroke (AIS) management, CT-based thrombus density has been associated with treatment success. However, currently used thrombus measurements are prone to inter-observer variability and oversimplify the heterogeneous thrombus composition. Our aim was first to introduce an automated method to assess the entire thrombus density and then to compare the measured entire thrombus density with respect to current standard manual measurements. MATERIALS AND METHOD In 135 AIS patients, the density distribution of the entire thrombus was determined. Density distributions were described using medians, interquartile ranges (IQR), kurtosis, and skewedness. Differences between the median of entire thrombus measurements and commonly applied manual measurements using 3 regions of interest were determined using linear regression. RESULTS Density distributions varied considerably with medians ranging from 20.0 to 62.8 HU and IQRs ranging from 9.3 to 55.8 HU. The average median of the thrombus density distributions (43.5 ± 10.2 HU) was lower than the manual assessment (49.6 ± 8.0 HU) (p<0.05). The difference between manual measurements and median density of entire thrombus decreased with increasing density (r = 0.64; p<0.05), revealing relatively higher manual measurements for low density thrombi such that manual density measurement tend overestimates the real thrombus density. CONCLUSIONS Automatic measurements of the full thrombus expose a wide variety of thrombi density distribution, which is not grasped with currently used manual measurement. Furthermore, discrimination of low and high density thrombi is improved with the automated method.","Santos, Emilie M M; Niessen, Wiro J; Yoo, Albert J; Berkhemer, Olvert A; Beenen, Ludo F; Majoie, Charles B; Marquering, Henk A",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0145641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26765847/,150

Neuromodulation achieved with tDCS may further regulate regional cerebral perfusion affiliated through the neurovascular unit; however, components of cerebral perfusion decrease across aging. A novel neuroimaging approach, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), can aid in quantifying these regional perfusional changes. To date, the interaction of the effects of tDCS on cognitive performance across the lifespan and obtained fNIRS hemodynamic responses remain unknown. Objective: This review aims to examine the effects of tDCS on cognitive performance and fNIRS hemodynamic responses within the context of cognitive aging. Methods: Six databases were searched for studies. Quality appraisal and data extraction were conducted by two independent reviewers. Meta-analysis was carried out to determine overall and subgroup effect sizes. Results: Eight studies met inclusion criteria. The overall effect size demonstrates that tDCS can alter cognitive performance and fNIRS signals, with aging being a potential intermediary in tDCS efficacy. Conclusion: From the studies included, the effects of tDCS on cognitive performance and fNIRS metrics are most prominent in young healthy adults and appear to become less robust with increasing age. Given the small number of studies included in this review further investigation is recommended.","Figeys, Mathieu; Zeeman, Michael; Kim, Esther Sung",Frontiers in human neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2021.623315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897392/,150

We also take issue with their characterisation of the New Jersey (NJ) allocation framework for ICU beds and ventilators, which is modelled after the multi-principle allocation framework we developed early in the pandemic. They characterise it as a two-criterion allocation framework and claim-without evidence-that it will 'compound disadvantage for black patients'. However, the NJ triage framework-like the model allocation policy we developed-actually contains four allocation criteria: the two criteria that the authors mentioned (chances for survival and near-term prognosis) and two criteria that they failed to mention which we included to promote equity: giving priority to frontline essential workers and giving priority to younger patients. These omissions are problematic both for reasons of factual accuracy and because the two criteria they failed to acknowledge would likely mitigate rather than exacerbate racial disparities during triage.","White, Douglas; Lo, Bernard",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099542/,150

However, the procedure can be technically challenging. The authors present their simple scroll technique for laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. METHODS A total of 174 patients underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repair using the scroll technique. The technique entails fixation of the rolled mesh to the anterior abdominal wall before it is unfolded. Patient characteristics, operative time, and complications were analyzed and compared with pooled data from the available literature on laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. RESULTS The mean operative time was comparable with that reported by others (mean, 102 vs. 100 min). The hospital stay was shorter (mean, 1.8 vs. 2.4 h). During a mean follow-up period of 28 months, the recurrence rate was lower than that reported by others (1.7% vs. 4.3%). There were no mortalities and no cases of inadvertent bowel injury. CONCLUSION The authors' scroll technique for laparoscopic repair is simple, feasible, and reproducible, with a short learning curve and a low recurrence rate.","Saber, A A; Elgamal, M H; Rao, A J; Itawi, E A; Mancl, T B",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-008-9791-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18322743/,150

The current COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to substantial deterioration to healthcare systems worldwide [2].Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients may have several barriers as medications access during the pandemic. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the tremendous challenges faced by the Egyptian SLE patients during COVID-19 pandemic either in the drug shortage, hospitalization or COVID-19 infection through a questionnaire-based study. Methods: This questionnaire-based study was carried out on 200 patients with SLE from Egypt. The questionnaire provided covered socioeconomic status, lupus disease data, knowledge about COVID-19 infection and medical and family history of COVID-19 infection. Results: The mean age of the participants was 30.1 years (with SD 8.4). Among the participants,180 (90 %) were females and 172 (86%) were from urban areas. Corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil and antimalarials were the most used medications (87%,87% and 70 % respectively). 140/200 (70 %) of the participants reported difficulty in obtaining medications during COVID-19 pandemic particularly antimalarials (60%). Lupus disease activity was affected by the drug shortage in half of the participants. Twenty-eight (14%) patients lost their jobs while 26 patients (13%) reported that their work was severely impacted by the crisis. Among the precautions taken for prophylaxis against infection wearing protective masks (74%) and using disinfectants of the hands several times per day (67%) were the most reported measures. Forty patients (20%) had to stop or reduce taking NSAIDs to guard against COVID-19 infection while 10 patients (5%) had to start taking antimalarials as a prophylaxis. Among 34 patients (17%) who needed hospitalization,26 (76%) were mainly due to lupus activity and 24 (71%) of them found difficulty on hospital admission because of COVID-19 pandemics. About 40 % of the participants reported that they had at least one close relative had confirmed COVID-19 infection. In addition, thirty-two patients (16%) had confirmed COVID-19 infection. Most of them became clinically free after treatment. However, about half of them had lupus flare and had to change the medications used for treatment of lupus. Figure 1 shows the differences between males and females in response to the questionnaire. 58.6% of females versus 20 % of males would use telemedicine for remote contact with the rheumatologist. Most of females were more keen than males to wear the masks (76.7% versus 50 % respectively). Conclusion: The current COVID-19 pandemic has negative impact on the healthcare provided to SLE patients in Egypt. Patients with SLE faced shortage their medications especially antimalarials.","Tharwat, S.; Zohdy, S.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.4064,150

Most SARS-CoV-2 studies characterize antibody responses in plasma/sera. While reliable and broadly used, these samples pose several logistical restrictions such as requiring venipuncture for collection and cold chain for transportation and storage. Dried blood spots (DBS) overcome these barriers as they can be self-collected by fingerstick and mailed and stored at ambient temperature. Here, we evaluate the suitability of DBS for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays by comparing several antibody responses between paired plasma and DBS from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and vaccinated individuals. We found that DBS not only reflected plasma antibody binding by ELISA and epitope profiles using phage-display, but also yielded SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers that highly correlated with paired plasma. Neutralization measurement was further streamlined by adapting assays to a high-throughput 384-well format. This study supports the adoption of DBS for numerous SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralization assays.","Itell, H. L.; Weight, H.; Fish, C. S.; Logue, J. K.; Franko, N.; Wolf, C. R.; McCulloch, D.

However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, R_t in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

These sensors exhibit ultrasensitive responses and rapid recovery performance under real-time respiratory conditions, realizing non-contact detection with a long distance of 40 cm. Even the instantaneous change of weak fingertip moisture can also be easily monitored by such respiratory sensors. Synchronous density functional theory calculations reveal the critical role of GDY’s unique acetylene structure on the easy adsorption/desorption of water molecules, which results in enhanced conductivity during the entire sensing process. These results provide a new carbon-based material as ink to print ultrasensitive respiration sensors, which can be used to develop large-scale industrialized integrated smart breathing masks or skin monitors, significantly expanding the prospects of carbon materials in multifunctional electronic skin.","Li, Yuan Zhang Mingjia Hu Xiuli Yu Lingmin Fan Xinhui Huang Changshui Li Yuliang",Nano Today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nantod.2021.101214,150

Building on 19 semi-structured interviews with Finnish political and economic journalists, this article examines how journalists themselves evaluate the pluralism of the economic policy debate. This article shows how journalists covering economic policy are critical when evaluating the level of pluralism in economic journalism, referring to a narrow range of expert sources and a widely shared economic policy consensus. These findings testify to the ability of ?primary definers? to set the boundaries of ?legitimate controversy? in economic journalism. Also, the interviews show how ruptures in economic policy, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting vast amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus, create space for more pluralism in economic journalism.","Harjuniemi, Timo",Journalism,https://doi.org/10.1177/14648849211035299,150

Identificamos diferencias entre casos que estimamos que aportan para desentrañar la complejidad de los protocolos legislativos en materia de derechos del cuidado en América Latina.Alternate abstract:In this article we address the issue of care rights in Latin America, specifically in Argentina and Mexico, focusing in particular on the legislative processes related to comprehensive care systems at the sub-national and national levels. We draw on the cases of Mexico City (2018-2019) and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (2019) as well as the national level in each country, where there are ongoing legislative initiatives (2020). We take a comparative socio-historical and gender approach to show the social and political dynamics involved in the legislative processes that lead to the recognition of the rights of caregivers and the cared for in each case, at the subnational levels of the capital cities and the national level of both countries. Our categories of analysis are: the social conditions of gender violence;the social and political actors that participate in the construction of demand for comprehensive care legislation;and the political-cultural and formal-normative components of the legislative proposals presented. We identify differences between cases that we think contribute to unravelling the complexity of the legislative processes related to care rights in Latin America.","Vinokur, Mora Giordano Verónica",Apuntes,https://doi.org/10.21678/apuntes.89.1467,150

The results, based on negative binomial regressions and linear spatial models, confirm the importance of multiple factors that positively correlate with the number of recorded cases during the first wave of the pandemic. Economic forces, including urban agglomeration, industrial districts, concentration of large companies (both before and after the beginning of the ?lockdown?) and a North-South gradient are the most significant predictors of the strength of COVID-19 infection. These effects are statistically more robust in the spatial models than in the a-spatial ones. We interpretate our results in the light of pitfalls related to data reliability, and we discuss policy implications and possible avenues for future research.","Cutrini, Eleonora Salvati Luca",Regional Science Policy & Practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/rsp3.12465,150
167674,Abkürzungsverzeichnis,2008-12-31,"Background: Evaluation of skin is central to both clinical practice and trials in systemic sclerosis (SSc). This is generally done with the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS). Remote consultations are now widely implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has inevitably limited evaluation of skin. To monitor skin during this pandemic and to further explore ways to assess skin, we developed the PASTUL (Patient self-Assessment of Skin Thickness in Upper Limb) questionnaire. Objectives: This study evaluated feasibility and validity of PASTUL in SSc. Methods: The PASTUL questionnaire uses a simple self-assessed grading of skin as normal, mild, moderate, or severely thickened at eight sites of upper limb corresponding to mRSS. Assessed grades were converted to an integer scale [0, 1, 2, 3]. Detailed instructions for patients were provided. Scleroderma Skin PRO (SSPRO) and Scleroderma Health Assessment Disability Index (SHAQ-DI) were also completed. For comparison, physician assessed mRSS was performed in a subgroup of patients. Construct validity was evaluated by examining the correlation between PASTUL, mRSS, SSPRO and SHAQ-DI using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Content validity was evaluated by scoring relevance, clarity and practical difficulty. Test-retest reliability was estimated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: 130 patients were invited of which 104 (80%) completed the questionnaires. The mRSS was undertaken in 78 patients (n=42, 54% limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc)). The PASTUL was completed by patients (86%) or by a partner/ friend (14%). Mean PASTUL score was 11 (SD 7), mean HAQ-DI 1.41 (SD 0.77) and mean SSPRO 48.3 (SD 27.0). PASTUL strongly correlated with total SSPRO and SSPRO subdomain physical limitations (r=0.60 and 0.62, respectively) (Figure 1A). Correlations between PASTUL and mRSS and mRSS upper limbs were moderate (r=0.56 and 0.58, respectively) (Figure 1B). An overview of all correlations is provided in Table 1. Correlation between PASTUL and mRSS was stronger in lcSSc compared to diffuse cutaneous SSc patients (r=0.53 vs 0.43) and when assessed by a partner/friend compared to patients themselves (r=0.90 vs 0.54). The PASTUL demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability (ICC of 0.93, p<0.001) and good content validity. Conclusion: The significant correlation of PASTUL scores with total SSPRO and physical limitation scores and moderate correlation with mRSS support the potential of PASTUL for remote evaluation of skin thickness in virtual clinical settings. Future studies may explore sensitivity to change and utility in clinical trials.","Spierings, J.; Ong, V.; Denton, C.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.75,150
167679,P. falciparum K13 mutations present varying degrees of artemisinin resistance and reduced fitness in African parasites,2021-01-27,"This article discusses some of the challenges posed by the introduction of COVID-19 certificates as a privileged tool for opening up mobility and access in order to restore a semblance of normality to social life. While at present there is no international consensus either on how - or why - such certificates should be used or on how they should be designed and applied, a growing number of countries have already introduced COVID-19 certificates in one form or another. Yet the scientific community as well as the World Health Organisation (WHO) have expressed caution, noting that such certificates might disproportionately discriminate against people on the basis of race, religion and socioeconomic background, as well as on the basis of age due to the sequencing of the vaccine rollout. Indeed, while the new COVID-19 certificates may appear to promise a magical solution enabling us to free up global mobility and reopen economies, they actually risk creating new borders and new forms of inequality through an exclusionary sorting and profiling mechanism that delimits ""safe""from ""unsafe""bodies, based on differential access to ""immuno-privilege""- but also differential forms of ""bio-securitisation"". They also provide an illusion of pandemic safety - assuring citizens that through the ""fetish""of the certificate ""safe travel""can magically be reinstated. Securing territories and populations has always been, in Foucauldian terms, a matter of ""making a division between good and bad circulation and maximizing the good circulation by diminishing the bad"". We can therefore reasonably expect growing contestation, including before courts, around COVID-19 certificates in their different national and international iterations, as their inherently discriminatory nature and other unintended consequences such as those stemming from the use of persuasive - as opposed to the more traditional coercive - governmental power begin to unfold in their performative trajectory. © 2021 The Author(s).","Alemanno, A.; Bialasiewicz, L.",European Journal of Risk Regulation,https://doi.org/10.1017/err.2021.38,150
167683,Sphingolipid Biosynthesis Inhibition As A Host Strategy Against Diverse Pathogens,2020-04-14,"Background: The role of chronic use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in rheumatic disease (RD) patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still subject of discussion. Objectives: To compare the occurrence of COVID-19 and its outcomes between RD patients on HCQ use with individuals from the same household not taking the drug during community viral transmission in an observational prospective multicenter study in Brazil. Methods: Participants were enrolled and monitored through 24-week (From March 29th to Sep 30th, 2020) regularly scheduled phone calls performed by trained medical professionals. Epidemiological and demographic data, as well as RD disease activity status and current treatment data, specific information about COVID-19, hospitalization, need for intensive care, and death was recorded in both groups and stored in the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. COVID-19 was defined according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health (BMH) criteria. The statistical analysis was performed using IBM-SPSS v.20.0 software. Group comparisons were made using the Man-Whitney, Chi-Square and Fisher Exact Test, as well as multivariate regression models adjusted to confounders. Survival curves were performed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: A total of 10,427 participants mean age (SD) of 44.04 (14.98) years were enrolled, including 6004 (57.6%) rheumatic disease patients, of whom 70.8% had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 6.7% rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 4% primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), 1.8% mixed connective tissue disease (DMTC), 1% systemic sclerosis (SSc) and others (15.9), including overlap syndromes. In total, 1,132 (10.8%) participants fulfilled criteria for COVID-19, being 6.7% RD patients and 4.1% controls (p=0.002). A recent influenza vaccination had a protective role (p<0.001). Moderate and severe COVID-19 included the need for hospitalization, intensive care, mechanical ventilation or death. Infection severity was not different between groups (p=0.391) (Table 1). After adjustments for multiple confounders, the main risk factors significantly associated with COVID-19 were higher education level (OR=1.29 95%CI 1.05-1.59), being healthcare professionals (OR=1.91;95%CI 1.45-2.53), presence of two comorbidities (OR=1.31;95%CI 1.01-1.66) and three or more comorbidities associated (OR=1.69;95%CI 1.23-2.32). Interestingly, age ≥=65 years (OR=0.20;95%CI 0.11-0.34) was negatively associated. Regarding RD, the risk factors associated with COVID-19 diagnosys were SLE (OR= 2.37;95%CI 1.92-293), SSc (OR=2.25;95%CI 1.05-4.83) and rituximab use (OR=1.92;95%CI 1.13-3.26). In addition, age ≥=65 years (OR=5.47;95%CI 1.7-19.4) and heart disease (OR=2.60;95%CI 1.06-6.38) were associated with hospitalization. Seven female RD patients died, six with SLE and one with pSS, and the presence of two or more comorbidities were associated with higher mortality rate. Conclusion: Chronic HCQ use did not prevent COVID-19 in RD compared to their household cohabitants. Health care profession, presence of comorbidities LES, SSc and rituximab were identified as main risk factors for COVID-19 and aging and heart disease as higher risk for hospitalization. Our data suggest these outcomes could be considered to manage them in clinical practice.","Salviato Pileggi, G.; Ferreira, G.; Gomides, A.

In the context of interpersonal relationships this manifests in cognitive distortions and magical thinking, specially in the vulnerable populations.ObjectivesTo study the ability of understanding social causality and its relation to magical thinking and ambiguity intolerance in schizophrenia and controls.MethodsParticipants were 40 inpatients with paranoid schizophrenia and 40 controls. Understanding of social causality was measured by corresponding SCORS-S scale for Thematic Apperception Test, Magical thinking was measured by SPQ-74 and intolerance to ambiguity by the New Tolerance-Intolerance to ambiguity questionnaires.ResultsThe understanding of social causality was less developed in schizophrenia group (mean values 2.28 and 3.28, p<.001). They manifest omissions of psychological aspects, logical faults and inconsistencies in depicting social relationships. Magical thinking was higher in clinical group (4.32 and 2.33, p<0.001). Two measures were significantly (p<0.05) correlated in both groups. Regression analysis indicates that 37.7% of variance of dependent variable ‘understanding of social causality’ (R2=0,377) was predicted by ‘magical thinking’ (-0,398, p<0,001) and ‘tolerance to ambiguity’ (0,412, p<0,001). The overal level of tolerance of ambiguity was higher in control group (52.2 and 61.0, p<0.002).ConclusionsTolerance of ambiguity, being more characteristic for normal population, underlies the understanding of social causality. In contrast, the intolerance to interpersonal ambiguity is related to increment of anxiety, failures in cognitive elaboration of interpersonal relationships and leads to superstition and illogical beliefs. This relationship has a heuristic value for understanding what is happening to vulnerable individuals in the context of current COVID pandemic.","Sokolova, E.; Andreyuk, K.; Ryzhov, A.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.1406,150
168492,Microbial strategies for survival in the glass sponge Vazella pourtalesii,2020-05-29,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of hand hygiene, surface disinfecting, and other hygiene interventions in preventing or reducing the spread of illnesses from respiratory viruses. DESIGN: Update of a systematic review and meta-analysis focussing on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs (c-RCTs) evidence only. DATA SOURCES: Eligible trials from the previous Cochrane review, search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase and CINAHL from 01 October 2010 to 01 April 2020, and forward and backward citation analysis of included studies. DATA SELECTION: RCTs and c-RCTs involving people of any age, testing the use of hand hygiene methods, surface disinfection or cleaning, and other miscellaneous barrier interventions. Face masks, eye protection, and person distancing are covered in Part 1 of our systematic review. Outcomes included acute respiratory illness (ARI), influenza-like illness (ILI) or laboratory-confirmed influenza (influenza) and/or related consequences (e.g. death, absenteeism from school or work). DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Six authors working in pairs independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and extracted data. The generalised inverse variance method was used for pooling by using the random-effects model, and results reported with risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We identified 51 eligible trials. We included 25 randomised trials comparing hand hygiene interventions with a control; 15 of these could be included in meta-analyses. We pooled 8 trials for the outcome of ARI. Hand hygiene showed a 16% relative reduction in the number of participants with ARI (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.86) in the intervention group. When we considered the more strictly defined outcomes of ILI and influenza, the RR for ILI was 0.98 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.14), and for influenza the RR was 0.91 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.34). Three trials measured absenteeism. We found a 36% relative reduction in absentee numbers in the hand hygiene group (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.71). Comparison of different hand hygiene interventions did not favour one intervention type over another. We found no incremental effects of combining hand hygiene with using face masks or disinfecting surfaces or objects. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of evidence for the impact of hand hygiene in reducing ILI and influenza, the modest evidence for reducing the burden of ARIs, and related absenteeism, justifies reinforcing the standard recommendation for hand hygiene measures to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. Funding for relevant trials with an emphasis on adherence and compliance with such a measure is crucial to inform policy and global pandemic preparedness with confidence and precision.","Al-Ansary, L.

The study compared perspectives between instructors (n = 47) and students (n = 254) at the College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences (CHRS) at Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University (PNU;Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia). Data were collected using an online questionnaire using convenient sampling method. The results showed a high level of readiness to shift to e-learning among instructors and students, as well as a positive correlation between perceived effectiveness and satisfaction. However, instructors showed a higher satisfaction level and perceived this shift to be effective more than students. This experience offers a reasonable foundation for any future plans to implement e-learning in health professions education and maximise its benefits without compromising the practical and clinical training provided via face-to-face learning. Further studies are needed to explore e-learning experiences a year after this shift, when educational institutions are expected to have clearer plans and have better prepared for e-learning.

To examine the factors relating to dietary changes among Japanese adults since the spread of COVID-19. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted via the internet in November 2020. All 6,000 participants, comprising 3,044 male and 2,956 female adults, aged 20–64 years, who registered with a research company received the questionnaire on email. The questionnaire included items on demographic characteristics;socioeconomic factors;past medical history;COVID-19 infection situation of their family and neighbors;fear of COVID-19;and lifestyle habits and healthy changes in dietary habits since the spread of COVID-19. The participants were given multiple choices in answers: changed to healthier;changed to unhealthier;and no-change. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine factors associated with dietary changes. Of the participants, 1,215 (20.3%) answered that their dietary habits became healthier, 491 (8.2%) answered as unhealthy, while a majority of them (4,294;71.6%), said their dietary habits remained unchanged. The results of the multinomial logistic regression analysis with unchanged as the reference indicated that healthier and unhealthier dietary change were negatively associated with age (OR [95% CI]: 0.89[0.84-0.95], 0.89 [0.81-0.97]) and positively associated with the past medical history of dyslipidemia (1.44 [1.11-1.86], 1.74 [1.23-2.46]) and fear of COVID-19 (1.05 [1.04-1.07], 1.02 [1.01-1.04]). Unhealthy change was positively associated with living alone, COVID-19 infection of colleagues, stress, and BMI;while annual household income, COVID-19 infection of oneself and friends, health literacy, frequency of exercise, and smoking were positively associated with healthier dietary changes. This study suggested that the factors determining healthy and unhealthy dietary change since the spread of COVID-19 were age, COVID-19 infection, and fear of COVID-19.

170239,Corrigendum,2021,"Background Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; CoV2) is a deadly contagious infectious disease. For those who survived COVID-19, post-COVID cardiac damage poses a major threat for the progression of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Currently, the number of COVID-related cases and deaths are increasing in Latin America, where a major COVID comorbidity is Chagas’ heart disease (caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi). Here, we investigated the effect of T. cruzi infection on the pathogenesis and severity of CoV2 infection and, conversely, the effect of CoV2 infection on heart pathology during coinfection. Methodology/findings We used transgenic human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (huACE2) mice infected with CoV2, T. cruzi, or coinfected with both in this study. Our study shows for the first time that white adipose tissue (WAT) serves as a reservoir for CoV2 and the persistence of CoV2 in WAT alters adipose tissue morphology and adipocyte physiology. Our data demonstrate a correlation between the loss of fat cells and the pulmonary adipogenic signaling (via adiponectin isomers) and pathology in CoV2 infection. The viral load in the lungs is inversely proportional to the viral load in WAT, which differs between male and female mice. Our findings also suggest that adiponectin-PPAR signaling may differently regulate Chagas cardiomyopathy in coinfected males and females. Conclusion We conclude that adipogenic signaling may play important roles in cardio-pulmonary pathogenesis during CoV2 infection and T. cruzi coinfection. The levels of adiponectin isomers differ between male and female mice during CoV2 infection and coinfection with T. cruzi, which may differently regulate inflammation, viral load, and pathology in the lungs of both the sexes. Our findings are in line with other clinical observations that reported that males are more susceptible to COVID-19 than females and suffer greater pulmonary damage.","Dhanyalayam, Dhanya; Lizardo, Kezia; Oswal, Neelam; Thangavel, Hariprasad; Dolgov, Enriko; Perlin, David S.; Nagajyothi, Jyothi F.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.18.460895,150

However, mobile tigecycline resistance genes, such as tmexCD-toprJ, have emerged in Enterobacterales isolated in China, Vietnam, and possibly other countries in the world. TMexCD-TOprJ complexes function as RND efflux pumps for multiple antimicrobials including tigecycline. To date, tmexCD1-toprJ1, tmexCD2-toprJ2, and tmexCD3-toprJ3 have been reported as variants of tmexCD-toprJ genes. Here, we identified a novel hybrid type of tmexCD-toprJ gene cluster, named tmexC3D2-toprJ3, in tigecycline- and carbapenem nonsusceptible isolates of Pseudomonas alcaligenes, a rare opportunistic human pathogen, obtained from medical sewage in Japan in 2020. Complete genomic analysis revealed that the P. alcaligenes isolate KAM426 co-harbors tmexC3D2-toprJ3 consisting of tmexC3, tmexD2, and toprJ3, along with two copies of the carbapenemase gene blaIMP-1 on the chromosome. tmexC3D2-toprJ3 in KAM426 was flanked by the IS5/IS1182 family transposase gene, suggesting that the gene cluster was acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Comparative genomic analysis using the public genome database showed that tmexC3D2-toprJ3 has spread to other Pseudomonas species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa via HGT mediated by mobile gene elements such as a plasmid. This study suggests that diverse tmexCD-toprJ-like tigecycline resistance genes have spread among MDR-GNB worldwide and further epidemiological genomic studies are needed.","Maehana, Shotaro; Eda, Ryotaro; Niida, Nagi; Hirabayashi, Aki; Sakai, Kouji; Furukawa, Takashi; Sei, Kazunari; Kitasato, Hidero; Suzuki, Masato",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453812,150

Material and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 156 participants, 90 (57.7%) participants from the COVID-19 intensive care unit and 66 (42.3%) from the general intensive care unit, were included. A printed questionnaire consisting of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), and demographic data were used. Results: Female gender, being a nurse, and working in COVID-19 intensive care unit, were associated with higher depression, anxiety, and stress scores. A significant relationship was found between fear of COVID-19 and depression (ρ=0.399, p=0.044), anxiety (ρ=0.456, p=0.019), and stress (ρ=0.418, p=0.033). Furthermore, as compared to general intensive care unit staff, COVID-19 intensive care unit staff who may have high-risk contact were approximately twice times more likely to experience anxiety and fear of COVID-19 and 3.5 times more likely to suffer from depression and stress. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the mental health of intensive care staff. Attention should be paid to the mental health of females and nurses working in the COVID-19 intensive care unit. The mental health of intensive care workers should be supported to protect the health workforce.","Çelik, F.; Dağli, R.",Duzce Medical Journal,https://doi.org/10.18678/dtfd.915010,150

As satisfaction with such measures is a function of their effectiveness, the main objective of this study was to identify the factors driving satisfaction with the measures implemented in Greece during the first pandemic wave. The study used data from the first round of the “Public Opinion in the European Union (EU) in Time of Coronavirus Crisis” survey. The sample consisted of 1050 individuals aged between 16 and 54 years. The results of the analysis, which was based on an adjacent category logistic model, indicate that materially deprived individuals were less likely to be satisfied with the restriction measures, while those considering that the health benefits were greater than the economic damage, those concerned for their own health and those concerned for the health of their family and friends were more likely to be satisfied with the restriction measures.

173806,Minimising exposure to droplet and aerosolised pathogens: a computational fluid dynamics study,2020-06-03,"Contemporary world events are demonstrating the need to embrace and further develop tele-health options for assessment and delivery of biopsychosocial healthcare services. This is now possible, given advances in communication technologies allowing virtual connections of medical personnel with constituents, as well as necessary, in light of recent challenges posed by infectious conditions and growing needs for travel restrictions, social distancing, and isolation of large portions of populations. Moreover, the opportunity to virtually connect with persons through ubiquitous computer-based and handheld communication devices allows comprehensive care provision to include underserved areas, where restricted, walk-in access to brick-and-mortar establishments has long been recognized as a limiting factor in healthcare. This review examines evolving approaches of tele-healthcare, with a specific focus on telemedicine as a bridge between traditional, in-person approaches to diagnose and treat medical conditions and new healthcare opportunities developing to meet changing societal needs. The three purposes of the review are: discuss background information, with a brief look at policy and procedure guiding applications of tele-techniques in healthcare practices;identify relevant scientific studies to show the breadth of new evidence-based research for telemedicine practices;and, discuss challenges for the further development of telemedicine as healthcare systems in the United States evolve to meet current and projected healthcare needs.

173983,An antiviral self-replicating molecular heterotroph,2020-08-13,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality has substantially improved over recent decades. Some evidence indicates this has been paralleled by an increasing proportion of non-cardiovascular mortality in people with CVD. However, the contemporary causes of death across a broad spectrum of CVDs, either alone or in combination, remains unclear. We analysed cardiovascular, infection, cancer and other causes of death prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in 493,280 participants in the prospective UK Biobank study. Studied CVDs included baseline: abdominal aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, valvular heart disease and venous thromboembolic disease; we separately considered cardiovascular multimorbidity defined as the total number of these baseline CVDs. Crude mortality rates and Poisson regression analysis were used to quantify the absolute and relative risk of cause-specific death. Associations are reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% CIs. During a median follow-up of 10.9 [IQR 10.1-11.6] years per participant, there were 27,729 deaths (20.4% primarily attributed to CVD, 53.6% to cancer, 5.0% to infection and 21.0% to other causes). As the number of co-morbid CVDs increased, the proportion of cardiovascular and infection-related deaths increased, whereas cancer and other deaths decreased. Accrual of multiple CVDs was associated with marked increases in relative risk of infection and cardiovascular death; versus those without CVD, people with three or more CVDs, the relative risk of cardiovascular death increased most (IRR 3.89; 95%CI 3.59-4.21), followed by infection (4.41; 3.44-5.64), with other (2.01; 1.72-2.35) and cancer (1.52; 1.35-1.72) being substantially less increased. All studied CVDs except atrial fibrillation were independently associated with increased risk of infection death, with heart failure (2.73; 1.60-4.66) and valvular heart disease (3.09; 2.38-4.00) posing the greatest risk. In conclusion, causes of death vary substantially between differing baseline CVDs, and according to the number of baseline CVDs, with non-cardiovascular deaths due to cancer and infection making an important contribution. Holistic and personalized care are likely to be important tools for continuing to improve outcomes in people with CVD.","Drozd, M.; Pujades-Rodriguez, M.; Sun, F.; Franks, K. N.; Lillie, P.

The study included 40 patients whose ages ranged from 20 to 80 years. The study also included taking 40 healthy people of the same age groups to detect interleukin 6 and 10 gamma interferon by using ELISA technique as well as measuring the level of the C-reactive protein. The study contained a withdrawal of five ml of venous blood from patients and patients and took all the necessary information from them such as gender, age, current living status, number of family members, as well as the history of infection and travel to countries affected by the virus to compare the two groups with regard to the immune response by measuring the variables above. The study showed that the highest mean level of IL-6 was found in newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients comparing with healthy control (60.76±8.46 v.s.39.03±5.26 pg/ml) (P:&lt;0.01). The study also demonstrated that the level of IL-10 was significantly elevated in newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients as compared with healthy control (38.18±4.57 v.s.31.84±3.19 pg/ml). The study established that the level of IFN-Gamma was significantly increased in patients with new infection of COVID-19 as compared with healthy control (27.27±7.18 v.s. 13.81±3.83 pg/ml) (P:&lt;0.01). The study proven that the level of CRP was increased significantly in patients with new infection of COVID-19 as compared with healthy control (33.18±3.19 v.s.3.±1.81 mg/dl) (P:&lt;0.01).

Design Retrospective cohort study using electronic medical record data. Primary outcome was interval between referral to MIGS and date of surgery. Setting Tertiary-level MIGS division in the southeast US. Patients or Participants Historical cohort undergoing surgery with MIGS 2014-2016 (n=377) and cohort in 2020 referred during the pandemic (n=191). Interventions Laparoscopic hysterectomy, myomectomy, adnexal surgery, or excision of endometriosis. Measurements and Main Results Patient demographics (race, age, marital status, language, insurance, and socioeconomic factors) were evaluated for significant associations with surgical delay. Patients with fibroids and abnormal uterine bleeding had a shorter interval to surgery (median 95 days, range 66-133) compared to patients with chronic pelvic pain (median 127 days, range 73-274). Our model adjusting for surgical indication revealed that single patients were 2.13 times as likely to wait >90 days (95% CI 1.35-3.36) compared to partnered patients prior to the pandemic. Additionally, those in the lowest quartile of median household income (<$42,572 vs > $75,020; OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.32, 4.46) and those from zip codes with the highest proportion of population in poverty (≥ 0.20 vs <0.07; OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.04, 3.6) were more likely to wait > 90 days. However, all of these differences disappeared during the pandemic. There were no differences in time to surgery by race, ethnicity, language, population density, markers of education by zip code, or insurance before or during the pandemic. Conclusion Historically, race and socioeconomic factors are associated with decreased access to MIGS and vulnerable populations were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, we found decreased time to surgery at our institution, and previous socioeconomic disparities associated with scheduling delays were improved during the pandemic, suggesting improved equitable access to tertiary-level MIGS.","McClurg, A.

The current pandemic situation in anticipation of a vaccine has posed serious threats to the health and economic sectors of countries worldwide. To overcome the quick transmission of the virus, the government of Australia has also taken drastic measures to prevent its spread. These policies include an international and interstate travel ban, social distancing rules, lockdown, shutdown of educational institutes and work-from-home policies. Such rules have affected people on both behavioural and psychological levels. This study aims to analyse the effect of COVID-19 on Australian citizens, and therefore, the changed behaviour of citizens concerning their mobility patterns, transport preferences and shopping methods under the pandemic have been studied. A detailed literature search was adopted for gathering data related to the study theme, along with real-time evidence of changes in the behaviour of people following the pandemic. The socioeconomic impact of the pandemic on social inequality and thereby the effect on the vulnerable people of the population are also studied. Authentic surveys and statistical data are consulted to figure out how the new lifestyle choices of people will linger in the post-pandemic era. It was found that people in Australia have adopted the work-from-home regime, and new habits suiting the nationwide restrictions have become routine for many people.","Munawar, Hafiz Suliman Khan Sara Imran Qadir Zakria Kiani Yusra Sajid Kouzani Abbas Z.; Mahmud, M.

Further, it described how the performance supported food security during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The location of the research was on Simeulue Island. The data were collected by doing depth-interview and observation. The anthropolinguistic approach was used in this research. The research presented a model of food security in a rural area that deliberates both natural conditions and human effort. It showed that the role of OTN affected tenacity for surviving their food security as a concept. It was delivered through their daily activity and on some occasions. In those moments, the procedure in farming and cultivating are shared in a frame of advice. The obedience to obeying advice had affected Simeuluenese way of having access to sufficient food as their food security. This effort protected them from lack of food (especially the primary food) during lockdown situations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be concluded that OTN has an important role and should be accounted for in the agricultural sector for food security. Oral tradition as a medium to store and share knowledge and experiences built a cultural-based effort to maintain Simeuluenese agriculture for food security.","Zulkarnain, Lubis T.; Ramlan, Dardanila Hasrul S.; Shaumiwaty, Saputra N.",IOP Conference Series.

175475,CLEAN AND FOLDED: OPTIMIZED PRODUCTION OF HIGH QUALITY RECOMBINANT HUMAN INTERFERON-Λ1,2020-12-10,"Loneliness is a public health concern with detrimental effects on physical and mental well-being. Given phenotypical overlaps between loneliness and social anxiety, cognitive behavioral interventions targeting social anxiety might be adopted to reduce loneliness. However, it is still elusive whether social anxiety and loneliness share the same underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. The current study aimed at investigating to what extent known behavioral and neural correlates of social avoidance in social anxiety are evident in loneliness. We used a pre-stratified approach involving 42 participants with high and 40 control participants with low loneliness scores. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the participants completed a social gambling task to measure the subjective value of engaging in a social situation and responses to positive and negative social feedback. Uni- and multivariate analyses of behavioral and fMRI data replicated known task effects across groups. However, although lonely participants were characterized by increased social anxiety, loneliness was associated with a response pattern clearly distinct from social anxiety. Specifically, Bayesian analyses revealed moderate evidence for equal subjective values of engaging in social situations and comparable amygdala responses to social decision-making and striatal responses to positive social feedback in both groups. Conversely, lonely participants showed significantly altered behavioral responsiveness to negative feedback and opposing striatal brain activity and connectivity compared to controls. Our findings suggest that loneliness is associated with altered emotional reactivity to social situations rather than behavioral tendencies to withdraw from social interactions. Thus, established interventions for social anxiety should be adjusted when targeting loneliness.","Lieberz, J.; Shamay-Tsoory, S.

We address this problem by investigating the consequences for the health system of an epidemic wave of a given size. This approach yields semi-quantitative results that depend on the proportion of the population already infected and vaccinated. We introduce the COVimpact software, which allows users to visualise estimated numbers of ICU admissions, deaths, and infections stratified by age class at the French departmental, regional, or national level caused by the wave. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by showing that for France, even with a 95% vaccination coverage, the current vaccine efficiency against the delta variant would make a large epidemic wave infecting 25% of the population difficult to sustain for the current hospital bed occupancy capacity. Overall, using the final epidemic wave size and ignoring detailed epidemiological dynamics yields valuable and practical insights to optimise public health response to epidemics.","Boennec, C.; Alizon, S.; Sofonea, M.

The life of adolescents has also changed significantly in many areas: study, communication with peers, contact with family, etc. and not all adolescents have adapted to these changes equally easily.ObjectivesStudy adolescents’ perception of Covid-19, describe the effect of self-isolation on adolescent emotional well-being, and examine changes in the family system through the eyes of a teenager.MethodsThe study involved two groups of adolescents: the first (G1) - 174 students of a Moscow school and the second (G2) - 39 adolescents hospitalized in a children’s psychiatric clinic in connection with suicidal actions. Teenagers filled out the author’s questionnaire, Short Health Anxiety Inventory (Salkovskis), Analysis of Family Anxiety (Eidemiller, Yustickis), Prohibition on the expression of feelings (Kholmogorova).ResultsParticipants in G2 significantly more often than G1 reported that their functioning worsened (it became more difficult to study - 72% versus 51%;more difficult to communicate - 76% versus 41%, more conflicts with family members - 49% versus 25%). G2 demonstrated a significantly higher level of family anxiety (M = 17.3 and M = 12.1 p<0.01), a more pronounced prohibition on expressions of negative emotions (M = 37.2 and M = 21.3 p<0.01). The level of anxiety (for one’s own health, well-being of relatives and financial stability) is also significantly higher in G2.ConclusionsMany adolescents in self-isolation need the support of relatives and the help of specialists.

Still, most retailers require their in-store pickup customers to wait in lengthy lines before being served and then wait again for their orders to be collected. It is, hence, imperative for the “Click & Collect” business model to be adjusted to minimize physical contact, so as to prevent future government-enforced store closures, safeguard the heavy downturn of retail sales and support the ailing economy during a potential recurring COVID-19 related crisis. That is exactly where the proposed solution sets its vision aiming to adapt “Click & Collect” to the new reality, by introducing an innovative, completely contactless customer order delivery system. The proposed innovation is based on the rapidly expanding “curbside pickup” model and enhanced with two technologies, i.e. Wi-Fi Positioning System and Augmented Reality.

Then a bipartite graph has been built with two sets of inputs;one set is the set of phytochemicals and the second set is the set of viruses. Thereafter, the eigen vector centrality which is the measure of most influential node in a graph has been calculated for each phytochemical. We found four such phytochemicals which have the top four eigen vector score. Then again, all possible cliques from the bipartite graph have been calculated and it has been seen that the same top four phytochemicals are present in almost all the bicliques.

178363,The analysis of biological diversity of coronaviruses contributes in the early awareness of their zoonotic spreading,2021,"Background: Although rare, myocarditis in the pediatric population is a disease process that carries significant morbidity and mortality. Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 related (COVID-19) pandemic, enteroviruses were the most common cause of classic myocarditis. However, since 2020, myocarditis linked to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is now common. In recent months, myocarditis related to COVID-19 vaccines has also been described. This study aims to compare these three different types of myocarditis with regards to clinical presentation, course, and outcomes. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all patients <21 years of age hospitalized at our institution with classic viral myocarditis from 2015-2019, MIS-C myocarditis from 3/2020-2/2021 and COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis from 5/2021-6/2021. We compared demographics, initial symptomatology, treatment, laboratory data, and echocardiogram findings. Results: Of 201 total participants, 43 patients had classic myocarditis, 149 had MIS-C myocarditis, and 9 had COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis. Peak troponin was highest in the classic myocarditis group, whereas the MIS-C myocarditis group had the highest recorded brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). There were significant differences in time to recovery of normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) for the three groups: nearly all patients with MIS-C myocarditis (n=139, 93%) and all patients with COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis (n=9, 100%) had normal LVEF at the time of discharge, but a lower proportion of the classic myocarditis group (n=30, 70%) had a normal LVEF at discharge (p<0.001). Three months post-discharge, 18 of 40 children (45%) in the classic myocarditis group still required heart failure treatment, whereas only one of the MIS-C myocarditis patients and none of the COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis patients did. Conclusions: Compared to those with classic myocarditis, those with MIS-C myocarditis had more significant hematologic derangements and worse inflammation at presentation, but had better clinical outcomes, including rapid recovery of cardiac function.

With implementation underway, little is known about the public perception of such certificates with potential differences in acceptability among individuals. In March 2021, a self-administered online questionnaire was proposed to all individuals 18 years and older participating in the longitudinal follow-up of population-based seroprevalence studies in Geneva, Switzerland. The questionnaire covered aspects of individual and collective benefits, while allowing participants to select contexts in which vaccination certificates should be presented. Results were presented as the proportion of individuals agreeing or disagreeing with the implementation of vaccination certificates, selecting specific contexts where certificates should be presented, and agreeing or disagreeing with the potential risks related to certificates. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for factors associated with certificate non-acceptance. Overall, 4,056 individuals completed the questionnaire (response rate 77.6%; mean age 53.3, standard deviation 14.4 years; 56.1% were women). About 61.0% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that a vaccination certificate was necessary in certain contexts; and 21.6% believed there was no context where vaccination certificates should be presented. Contexts where a majority of participants perceived a vaccination certificate should be presented included jobs where others would be at risk of COVID-related complications (60.7%), jobs where employees would be at risk of getting infected (58.7%), or to be exempt from quarantine when traveling abroad (56.1%). Contexts where fewer individuals perceived the need for vaccination certificates to be presented were participation in large gatherings (36.9%), access to social venues (35.5%), or sharing the same workspace (21.5%). Younger age, an absence of willingness to get vaccinated, and an absence of belief in vaccination as an important step in surmounting the pandemic were factors associated with certificate non-acceptance. This large population-based study showed that the general adult population in Geneva, Switzerland, agreed with the implementation of vaccination certificates in work-related and travel-related contexts. However, this solution was perceived as unnecessary for access to large gatherings or social venues, or to share the same workspace. Differences were seen with gender, age, education, socio-economic status, and vaccination willingness and perception, highlighting the importance of taking personal and sociodemographic variations into consideration when predicting acceptance of such certificates.","Nehme, M.; Baysson, H.; Pullen, N.; Wisniak, A.; Penacchio, F.; Zaballa, M.-E.; Fargnoli, V.; Trono, D.; Kaiser, L.; Hurst, S.; Burton-Jeangros, C.; Stringhini, S.; Specchio-COVID19 study group,; Guessous, I.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.21259189v1?rss=1,150

This study aims to 1) characterise early obesity prevention interventions in terms of target behaviours, delivery features, and behaviour change techniques (BCTs), 2) explore similarities and differences in BCTs used to target behaviours, and 3) explore effectiveness of intervention components in preventing childhood obesity. Methods and analysis: Annual comprehensive systematic searches will be performed in Epub Ahead of Print/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane (CENTRAL), CINAHL, PsycINFO, as well as clinical trial registries. Eligible randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventions to prevent childhood obesity commencing antenatally or in the first year after birth will be invited to join the TOPCHILD Collaboration. Standard ontologies will be used to code target behaviours, delivery features and BCTs in both published and unpublished intervention materials provided by trialists. Narrative syntheses will be performed to summarise intervention components and compare applied BCTs by types of target behaviours. Exploratory analyses will be undertaken to assess effectiveness of intervention components. Ethics and dissemination: The study has been approved by The University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (project no. 2020/273) and Flinders University Social and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee (project no. HREC CIA2133-1). The studys findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and targeted communication with key stakeholders. Discussion: Our study will provide an in depth understanding of behavioural components and delivery features used in obesity prevention interventions starting antenatally or in the first 12 months after birth. Understanding common intervention approaches in a systematic way will provide much needed insight to advance the design of early obesity prevention interventions and provide the opportunity to undertake future quantitative predictive modelling.

Analyses highlight that firms with a high liquidity risk experience a decrease in their cumulative average abnormal return, which is more severe than low-liquidity-risk firms do. Also, firms with a high cash ratio do not appear to face cash-flow insolvency threats in this pandemic.

Part of the current measures for dealing with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is proper ventilation in indoor settings. This is especially important in schools with students coming back to the classroom even with high incidents rates. Static ventilation patterns do not consider the individual situation for a particular class. Influencing factors like the type of activity, the physical structure or the room occupancy are not incorporated. Also, existing devices are rather expensive and often provide only limited information and only locally without any networking. This leaves the potential of analysing the situation across different settings untapped. Carbon dioxide level can be used as an indicator of air quality, in general, and of aerosol load in particular. Since, according to the latest findings, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted primarily in the form of aerosols, carbon dioxide may be used as a proxy for the risk of a virus infection. Hence, schools could improve the indoor air quality and potentially reduce the infection risk if they actually had measuring devices available in the classroom. Our device supports schools in ventilation and it allows for collecting data over the Internet to enable a detailed data analysis and model generation. First deployments in schools at different levels were received very positively.

To complement an on-going Phase 3 efficacy study, this report expands on previously reported immunogenicity results from a Phase 1 trial of an AS03-adjuvanted, plant-based virus-like particle (VLP) displaying the spike glycoprotein of the Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus (NCT04450004). Durability of the humoral and cellular responses against the ancestral strain was evaluated 6 months post-second dose (Day 201) at which time ~94% of vaccinated individuals remained seropositive. Interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) responses remained detectable in ~94% and ~92% of vaccinated individuals respectively. Cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies to Alpha (B.1.17), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P.1) variants of concern (VOC) were also measured. Twenty-one days after the second vaccination, detectable neutralizing antibodies were observed to the Alpha variant by both pseudovirion and wild-type assays for all vaccinated individuals, while 94.7% of individuals had detectable antibodies to the Beta variant in both assays. Neutralizing antibodies to the Gamma variant were detected in 100% and 94.7% of individuals using the pseudovirion and live virus neutralization assays, respectively. In all cases, the vaccine-induced neutralizing GMTs to the VOC 3 weeks post-vaccination were greater than the Wuhan-specific neutralization titers seen in individuals recovered from COVID-19.","Gobeil, P.

179890,Ancestral Regulatory Mechanisms Specify Conserved Midbrain Circuitry in Arthropods and Vertebrates,2019-10-28,"Introduction The long-term management of patients following valve replacement is challenging. The fields of percutaneous and surgical valves are expanding rapidly, leading to increased service demands. Most patients in our institution are managed within a dedicated cardiac physiologist' run valve clinic. Initially, follow-up centred around ESC 2012 guidelines on the management of valve disease, which recommended a baseline clinical and echocardiographic assessment after surgery and lifelong annual clinical follow-up. In addition, they recommended annual echocardiogram 5 years for bioprosthetic valves with no specific guidance for mechanical valves. Locally, all patients enrolled into the valve clinic received annual clinical and echocardiographic assessment. In 2019, the BHVS/ BSE published more comprehensive guidance on long-term follow- up of these patients. The Covid-19 pandemic placed pressure on the NHS to reduce outpatient appointments. Prior to service alteration, we conducted an audit to expand our understanding of outcomes in these patients. Methods We retrospectively analysed the data of all patients enrolled in our valve service. We assessed demographics, date and indication for surgery, prosthesis type and position, baseline assessment, frequency of follow-up and significant valverelated complications. Complications constituted: any degree of paravalvular regurgitation, ≥moderate transvalvular regurgitation, raised transvalvular gradients, valve thrombosis, infective endocarditis, new LV dysfunction, need for reintervention, cardiac-related hospital admission and valverelated death. Results We identified 294 patients who underwent valve replacement since clinic establishment in 2010. Patient demographics are shown in table 1. Only 37% of patients had baseline echocardiogram following surgery. Once enrolled into the clinic, 82.7% had yearly clinical and echocardiographic assessment. Table 2 demonstrates the echocardiographic and clinical complications we identified. During follow up 20.7% developed regurgitation, 9.5% developed abnormal gradients and one required re-intervention for re-stenosis. One patient had valve thrombosis and was managed medically. Additionally, 9.2% were diagnosed with new LV dysfunction;four of these required admission with decompensated heart failure and one died. 3.4% developed infective endocarditis;three required redo surgery and four died. Figure 1 provides a schematic of valve-related complications and outcomes. Importantly, all patients who required admission, re-do surgery or that died, presented acutely with symptoms;the complications were not picked-up by the valve clinic. Conclusions Contrast to our expectations, we identified only a small number of valve-related complications. With pressures rising to reduce outpatient footprint, we are now in the process of safely adjusting our practice in line with the BHVS/ BSE recommendations, supported by the evidence generated by our audit. We strongly encourage departments review their current services and implement evidence-based guidelines in the long-term management of patients with valve replacements.","Demetriades, P.; Oatham, R.; Oxley, C.; Griffiths, T.; Clews, S.; Stokes, N.; Heatlie, G.; Duckett, S.",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2021-bcs.21,150

The NAb levels against the wild type (WA1/2020), Delta, and Kappa variants were measured and compared. Depending on each individual's medical condition and vaccination status, the NAb levels for most of the fully vaccinated people decreased within 2-6 months, while a small number of individuals either generated non-detectable amount of NAbs after full vaccination (e.g., immunocompromised), or had high NAb levels lasting beyond 6 months. Since the NAb levels vary significantly among different individuals and decrease over time, the deployment of a low-cost rapid test to monitor NAb levels against both the wild type and emerging variants among fully vaccinated individuals can play a very crucial role to control the current pandemic. Our study provides an example of using such a rapid NAb test to fill this currently unmet medical need.","Pan, J.; Li, Z.; Wang, L.; Szymanski, J.; Romano, M.; Yin, D.; Wang, A.; Small, T.; Zou, Z.; Li, J.; Witham, G.; Zhang, Y.; Qi, K.; Yin, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.01.21264371v1?rss=1,150

Working remotely, especially in a situation with COVID-19 pandemic, increases the risks of voluntary employee turnover, since it makes the judgment of employee attitudes more difficult for the managers. Voluntary employee turnover (VET) measurements are one of the key indicators for evaluating the effectiveness of personnel management practices in organizations. The paper proposes a solution to decrease the risk of voluntary employee turnover in organizations. The authors propose a machine learning based model to identify the employees prone to voluntary employee turnover based on the employee data gathered and stored by the organization. The model will allow the managers to make a prediction based on data of the risks associated with voluntary employee turnover and to adjust the decision making process based on the information. To create the proposed IT solution for predicting the voluntary employee turnover analysis of models describing it has been performed to identify the most important factors that influence it. 9 factor groups with 67 factors of VET have been identified during the analysis. In the next step, 46 data clusters relevant for the decision making have been identified in specific organization and data from the clusters retrieved for the analysis. Based on the analysis a model for machine learning will be created, developed, and validated for the use in organizations. © 2021 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies.

Our principal finding is that the complex is hexameric, centered around nsp15. The nsp15 hexamer is capped on two faces by trimers of nsp14/nsp16/(nsp10)2, where nsp14 is seen to undergo a large conformational change between its two domains. This conformational change facilitates binding of six nsp12/nsp7/(nsp8)2 polymerase subunits to the complex. To this, six subunits of nsp13 are arranged around the superstructure, but not evenly distributed. Two of the six polymerase subunits are each proposed to carry dimers of nsp13, while two others are proposed to carry monomers. The polymerase subunits that coordinate nsp13 dimers also bind the nucleocapsid, which positions the 5’-UTR TRS-L RNA over the polymerase active site, a state distinguishing transcription from replication. Analyzing the path of the viral RNA indicates the dsRNA that exits the polymerase passes over the nsp14 exonuclease and nsp15 endonuclease sites before being unwound by a convergence of zinc fingers from nsp10 and nsp14. The template strand is then directed away from the complex, while the nascent strand is directed to the sites responsible for mRNA capping (the nsp12 NiRAN and the nsp14 and nsp16 methyltransferases). The model presents a cohesive picture of the multiple functions of the coronavirus replication-transcription complex and addresses fundamental questions related to proofreading, template switching, mRNA capping and the role of the endonuclease. It provides a platform to guide biochemical and structural research to address the stoichiometric and spatial configuration of the replication-transcription complex. Author Summary The replication of the coronavirus genome and the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA is a complex process involving multiple viral proteins. Despite a fairly complete structural picture of the individual proteins that are believed to coalesce into a larger replication-transcription complex, there is no clear model of how these proteins interact. Here we present the first detailed atomistic model of a complete replication-transcription complex for SARS-CoV-2, made up of the non-structural proteins nsp7-nsp16, as well as the nucleocapsid. Forming a large, hexameric superstructure centered around nsp15, the model provides new perspective on the function of its individual components, including the exonuclease, the endonuclease, the NiRAN site, the helicase, the multiple zinc fingers, and the nucleocapsid. It offers a cohesive view of replication, proofreading, template switching and mRNA capping, which should serve as a guide for future experimental exploration.","Perry, Jason K.; Appleby, Todd C.; Bilello, John P.; Feng, Joy Y.; Schmitz, Uli; Campbell, Elizabeth A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.08.447516,150

However, limited information on the skeletal complications of COVID-19 is known, even though inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract have been known to perturb bone metabolism and cause pathological bone loss. In this study, we characterized the effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on bone metabolism in an established golden Syrian hamster model for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 causes significant multifocal loss of bone trabeculae in the long bones and lumbar vertebrae of all infected hamsters. The bone loss progressively worsens from the acute phase to the post-recovery phase. Mechanistically, the bone loss was associated with SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine dysregulation which upregulates osteoclastic differentiation of monocyte-macrophage lineage. The pro-inflammatory cytokines further trigger a second wave of cytokine storm in the skeletal tissues to augment their pro-osteoclastogenesis effect. Our findings in this established hamster model suggest that pathological bone loss may be a neglected complication which warrants more extensive investigations during the long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients. The benefits of potential prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against pathological bone loss should be further evaluated.

For example, almost nothing is known about the transcription factors that induce defense against intracellular intestinal infection in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Two types of intracellular pathogens that naturally infect the C. elegans intestine are the Orsay virus, which is a positive-sense RNA virus, and microsporidia, which are fungal pathogens. Surprisingly, these molecularly distinct pathogens induce a common host transcriptional response called the Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR). Here we describe zip-1 as an IPR regulator that functions downstream of all known IPR activating and regulatory pathways. zip-1 encodes a putative bZIP transcription factor of previously unknown function, and we show how zip-1 controls induction of a subset of genes upon IPR activation. ZIP-1 protein is expressed in the nuclei of intestinal cells, and is required in the intestine to upregulate IPR gene expression. Importantly, zip-1 promotes resistance to infection by the Orsay virus and by microsporidia in intestinal cells. Altogether, our results indicate that zip-1 represents a central hub for all triggers of the IPR, and that this transcription factor plays a protective role against intracellular pathogen infection in C. elegans.","Lažetić, Vladimir; Wu, Fengting; Cohen, Lianne B.; Reddy, Kirthi C.; Chang, Ya-Ting; Gang, Spencer S.; Bhabha, Gira; Troemel, Emily R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.17.448850,150

Identified pleiotropic SNPs were annotated to ADAMTS7 and IL6R. Increased ADAMTS7 expression across tissues consistently showed decreased risk for CAD and increased risk for pneumonia; increased IL6R expression showed increased risk for CAD and decreased risk for pneumonia. We similarly observed opposing CAD/pneumonia effects for NLRP3. Reduced ADAMTS7 expression conferred a reduced CAD risk without increased pneumonia risk only among never-smokers. Genetic immune-inflammatory axes of CAD linked to respiratory infections implicate ADAMTS7 and IL6R, and related genes.","Yu, Z.; Zekavat, S.

183229,RESEARCHERS TRACE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK IN CHINA TO SNAKES,2020-02-11,"The number of students flowing from low-income countries to high-income countries has grown over the past several decades but is likely to fall substantially in the coming years due to the coronavirus pandemic. To gauge the potential impact of the coronavirus-induced reduction in the international flow of student migrants, we estimate the pre-pandemic effects of student migration from 122 low- and middle-income countries to French- and English-speaking high-income countries on the economic growth of the sending countries. Using region fixed-effects and instrumental-variables estimators to address the potential endogeneity of student-migrant flows, we find positive and statistically significant effects of student migration on per capita GDP in sending countries. These findings are robust to different time lags, and are increasing over time. Our results indicate that student migrants have a modest but meaningful impact on the short-run economic growth of their home countries. In terms of the mechanisms through which student-migrant flows can affect growth of the home countries, we find evidence of ‘incentive effects’ for students going to English-speaking countries, and evidence of student-migrant flows affecting interest in politics and democratic political systems in the sending countries.","Jean Donovan, Rasamoelison Averett Susan Stifel David",Applied Economics,https://doi.org/10.1080/00036846.2021.1886237,150
183359,Progress toward an HIV vaccine.,2005,"We consider a population evolving due to mutation, selection and recombination, where selection includes single-locus terms (additive fitness) and two-loci terms (pairwise epistatic fitness). We further consider the problem of inferring fitness in the evolutionary dynamics from one or several snap-shots of the distribution of genotypes in the population. In the recent literature this has been done by applying the Quasi-Linkage Equilibrium (QLE) regime first obtained by Kimura in the limit of high recombination. Here we show that the approach also works in the interesting regime where the effects of mutations are comparable to or larger than recombination. This leads to a modified main epistatic fitness inference formula where the rates of mutation and recombination occur together. We also derive this formula using by a previously developed Gaussian closure that formally remains valid when recombination is absent. The findings are validated through numerical simulations.","Zeng, Hong-Li; Mauri, Eugenio; Dichio, Vito; Cocco, Simona; Monasson, Remi; Aurell, Erik",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16735v3.pdf,150
183867,Verification of a specific reaction between an airborne antigen and an immobilized antibody at a gas-solid interface.,2009,"Improvements in technology over the past two decades have increased the ability of employees to work remotely however there has been a hesitation on the part of organizations and managers to allow this practice. In response to the Covid-19 lockdown, companies were forced to adopt teleworking arrangements for their entire workforce. Research has demonstrated that managers are the gatekeepers of adoption and diffusion decisions in organizations. This study investigates whether managers that experienced telework in their teams over the mandated lockdown period changed their perceptions of telework and willingness to allow their staff to work remotely and describes their perceptions. A survey was sent to managers twice within a four-month period in a single case organization in South Africa that was forced to allow the entire workforce to telework. The results of the study found that when managers had experienced telework for four months, they were more in favour of supporting this working arrangement in the organization. Yet teleworking is not without its challenges which this study highlights. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Knoesen, H.; Seymour, L.

183896,Current awareness in human psychopharmacology.,2003,"Purpose: This paper aims to focus on the influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on business-to-business (B2B) firms’ relationship initiation and customer relationship management in an under-explored and unique context of high-tech industrial microenterprises. The authors analyze the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the specific context of B2B relationship initiation and customer relationship management dynamics by examining Finnish B2B industrial microenterprises. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses exploratory in-depth case studies undertaken in three Finnish industrial microenterprises to analyze the influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on their new business relationship initiation and relationship management with the current customers. Findings: The case firms quickly adjusted to the “new normal” and used a number of technological resources, including online meetings and three-dimensional demonstrations, among others. A key reason for this quick adjustment was them being microenterprises. However, despite this, lack of access to customer sites remained a hindrance as their products need to fit certain production processes, which cannot be done without physical visits. Furthermore, the development of trust with new customers, especially those based in emerging markets, was challenging due to the lack of physical meetings and site visits. Research limitations/implications: The research highlights the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to B2B relationships and gives an account of the changing dynamics of relationship initiation and customer relationship management amid technological and societal disruptions. It also highlights the continued role of personal relationships and psychical meetings in such relationships. As such, the research informs B2B research that examines the role of personal relationships in B2B marketing. Practical implications: The study offers industrial microenterprise executives insights into how to face and tackle COVID-19 driven challenges in B2B customer relationship management and how to integrate technological tools in relationship management practices while understanding where face-to-face meetings are indispensable. Originality/value: The study demonstrates areas in which virtual tools can and cannot be substitutes for conventional means of B2B relationship initiation and customer relationship management across developed and emerging markets. It also highlights the specificities of industrial microenterprises and their business development and customer relationship management dynamics mechanisms, a research area that has been rather ignored by prior studies. © 2021, Ahmad Arslan, Ismail Golgeci, Zaheer Khan, Petri Ahokangas and Lauri Haapanen.","Arslan, A.; Golgeci, I.; Khan, Z.; Ahokangas, P.; Haapanen, L.",International Journal of Organizational Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijoa-04-2021-2719,150

Whether, infected human hosts transmit vesicle packed aerosols of pathogen’s antigen for natural vaccination of the community has not yet been considered. We have explored a traditional healing method of aerosol-inoculation against small pox and tuberculosis in the Sualkuchi-Hajo cultural complex of Kamarupa, an ancient Indian region known for tantra-based healing and spirituality. In the aerosol-inoculation method against TB, selected persons with TB (later identified as smear negative TB subject) are encouraged to spread good nigudah in the community by Kirtan chanting; the good Nigudah are thought to be present within bad-nigudah or invisible krimis (tiny flesh eating living being mentioned in ancient India’s medicinal text Caraka Samhita and Atharva Veda). A 15-years of contact TB investigation study, as well as laboratory study of aerosol obtained from smear negative PTB (SN-PTB) subjects led to the identification of good Nigudah as extracellular vesicles (EVs) filled with Mtb-antigen ESAT-6. We then developed a mouse model of aerosol-inoculation using SN-PTB subject derived aerosol EVs, and identified Mtb infected mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of the lung as the putative source of the ESAT-6+ EVs. These Mtb infected MSCs reprogram to altruistic stem cell (ASC) phenotype, which then secrete ESAT-6+ EVs to the aerosols; healthy mice receiving the aerosol develop Mtb specific herd immunity. These results expedite our ongoing work on the innate defense mechanism of ASCs against pathogen, and provide a novel mechanism of natural vaccination, where the host extracts appropriate antigens from a pathogen, and then spread it in the community via aerosols.","Das, Bikul; Pathak, Lekhika; Gayan, Sukanya; Pal, Bidisha; Saikia, Parthajyoti; Baishya, Tutumoni; Das, Nihar Ranjan; Das, Rupam; Maral, Mallika; Mahanta, Ranjit; Bhuyan, Seema; Gautam, Pratibha; Talukdar, Joyeeta; Sandhya, Sorra; Kalita, Deepjyoti; Swami, Vijay; Das, Krishna Ram; Bora, Dayal Krishna; Ghora, Jagat; Pulu, Ista",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.14.382572,150
184419,Controlling subcellular delivery to optimize therapeutic effect.,2010,"The pandemic has highlighted with particular evidence the vulnerability of people with mental disorders and a series of specific ethical concerns regarding their condition. First of all, the risk of receiving poor medical care due to the double stigma of being affected by a mental disorder and Covid infection, in addition to the many other additional barriers, including poverty, marginal housing, and food insecurity. Moreover, in some countries, in a situation where demands for intensive care exceeded the treatment facilities available, the tragical ethical dilemma regarding the choice of people to be saved was resolved with the option in favor of healthier and/or younger people who have more chances of recovery, thus excluding, among others, aged people with severe mental disorders such as dementias. In other countries, ethical concerns emerged related to the enhanced risk of involuntary hospital admission of individuals with severe mental illness mainly due the high likelihood of these patients violating physical-distancing and other safety rules. Social distancing measures have determined, among others, relevant obstacles for direct access to psychiatric care services, with the consequent adoption of the so called “telepsychiatry” of “tele mental health” by mental health services, a measure which unfortunately has cut off a large amount of patients who have not been able to benefit from these innovative methods of care both because of barriers posed by their own serious mental conditions, and by the impossibility of having the necessary technology.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Carpiniello, B.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.46,150
184458,Pattern of Colon Cancer Lymph Node Metastases in Patients Undergoing Central Mesocolic Lymph Node Excision: A Systematic Review.,2016,"The COVID-19 pandemic has its origins in a constant but rather rare biological phenomenon: the emergence of infectious diseases of zoonotic origin in human populations. The agent of an infectious animal or zoonotic disease depends for its multiplication and dispersion on a wild host species to which it has adapted over time and which constitutes the reservoir of the corresponding infectious disease. If the biotope of this initial host is sustainably modified, the associated biocenosis migrates with its pathogenic flora to a new habitat, enabling the pathogen to change animal host species. If this migration introduces it into the human environment, the infectious agent may pass to humans or to a commensal wildlife or domestic species that will serve as an intermediate host. This ecological mechanism involves multiple and complex interactions that result in a direct link between biodiversity erosion and increased frequency of these emergences in humans. Together with at-risk human socio-economic practices, it determines the distribution of the territories where these diseases emerge worldwide. Chronic diseases and psychosocial vulnerabilities in humans could potentially worsen the phenomenon. To be able to carry out a targeted action to identify and stop an outbreak of an unknown infectious disease, we need to be able to predict which pathogen is most likely to constitute a threat and in which regions of the world. It is a difficult scientific problem that requires a holistic vision of the ""one health"" type that decompartmentalizes animal health, human health, and ecosystem health, and a transdisciplinary approach focusing on the microbial ecology of infectious diseases, the biology of evolution, and the social sciences.","Lesne, J.",Environnement Risques &amp; Sante,https://doi.org/10.1684/ers.2021.1560,150

In addition, networks underlying infection events are often much more complex than described by meanfield equations or regular lattices. In models with simple transition rules such as the SIS and SIR models, heterogeneous contact rates are known to decrease epidemic thresholds. We analyze steady states of various multi-state disease propagation models with heterogeneous contact rates. In many models, heterogeneity simply decreases epidemic thresholds. However, in models with competing pathogens and mutation, coexistence of different pathogens for small infection rates requires network-independent conditions in addition to heterogeneity in contact rates. Furthermore, models without spontaneous neighbor-independent state transitions, such as cyclically competing species, do not show heterogeneity effects.","Masuda, Naoki; Konno, Norio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0504329v4.pdf,150

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses daily stock market indices on three major stock price indices: construction industry sector index, real estate operating company (REOC) industry index and the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry index of the Korea Stock Exchange (KRX), from January 8, 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) began to issue official indicators regarding COVID-19, to March 27, 2020, the last trading day of the week during which the South Korean government's stock market stabilisation fund was launched. Findings: Results indicate the REIT sector's stock rate of return to be relatively less sensitive to impacts of COVID-19 compared to those of the two other indices. Impulse response analysis also shows similar results. Impulse response estimations indicate that earlier information of REITs has prominent significance in explaining changes in the time series process itself. Similar to findings of prior studies that have been conducted with long-term perspectives, results of our short-term study indicate that the medium-risk, medium-return characteristic of the real estate industry has significance even in short-term perspectives. Practical implications: REITs can be an investment vehicle that provides strong benefits of diversified investment for mutual fund investment managers even in the case of short-term exogenous market disruptions.

In this paper, the floating population of each city in Wuhan is taken as a proxy variable for the number of potential new coronavirus infections. Firstly, to use the non-parametric method correctly, the symmetric Gauss kernel and asymmetric Gamma kernel are applied to estimate the density of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China. The result confirms that the Gamma kernel provides a more reasonable density estimation of bounded data than the Gauss kernel. Then, through the non-parametric method based on the Gamma kernel estimation, this paper finds a positive relationship between Wuhan’s mobile population and cumulative confirmed cases, while the relationship between temperature and cumulative confirmed cases is inconclusive in China when the impact of the number of potential new coronavirus infections in each city is considered. Compared with the weather, the potentially infected population plays a more critical role in spreading the virus. Therefore, the role of prevention and control measures is more important than weather factors. Even in summer, we should also pay attention to the prevention and control of the epidemic.","Lin, Weiran He Qiuqin",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158504,150
185617,Ocular tropisms of murine coronavirus (strain JHM) after inoculation by various routes.,1991,"The use of technology as a facilitator in learning environments has become increasingly prevalent with the global pandemic caused by COVID-19. As such, computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) gains a wider adoption in contrast to traditional learning methods. At the same time, the need for automated tools capable of assessing and stimulating collaboration between participants has become more stringent, as human monitoring of the increasing volume of conversations becomes overwhelming. This paper introduces a method grounded in dialogism for evaluating students’ involvement in chat conversations based on semantic chains computed using language models. These semantic chains reflect emergent voices from dialogism that span and interact throughout the conversation. Our integrated method uses contextual information captured by BERT transformer models to identify links in a chain that connects semantically related concepts from a voice uttered by one or more participants. Two types of visualizations were generated to depict the longitudinal propagation and the transversal inter-animation of voices within the conversation. In addition, a list of handcrafted features derived from the constructed chains and computed for each participant is introduced. Several machine learning algorithms were tested using these features to evaluate the extent to which semantic chains are predictive of student involvement in chat conversations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Dascalu, M.

Cooking fume exposure during frying could be an important risk factor. We carried out a population-based case-control study in Hong Kong. Cases were Chinese female nonsmokers with newly diagnosed primary lung cancer. Controls were female nonsmokers randomly sampled from the community, frequency matched by age groups. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a standardized questionnaire. The ""total cooking dish-years,"" categorized by increments of 50, was used as a surrogate of cooking fumes exposure. Multiple unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) for different levels of exposure after adjusting for various potential confounding factors. We interviewed 200 cases and 285 controls. The ORs of lung cancer across increasing levels of cooking dish-years were 1, 1.17, 1.92, 2.26, and 6.15. After adjusting for age and other potential confounding factors, the increasing trend of ORs with increasing exposure categories became clearer, being 1, 1.31, 4.12, 4.68, and 34. The OR of lung cancer was highest for deep-frying (2.56 per 10 dish-years) followed by that of frying (1.47), and stir-frying had the lowest OR (1.12) among the three methods. Cumulative exposure to cooking by means of any form of frying could increase the risk of lung cancer in Hong Kong nonsmoking women.

Whereas pre-incubation for 10 min with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), did not or only weakly affected the enzyme activity, the bidentate chelator 1,10-phenanthroline produced a complete and concentration-dependent inhibition of AP-N. The corresponding curves had Hill slopes of 2.50 +/- 0.23 and 2.73 +/- 0.01 for soluble and recombinant AP-N respectively. EDTA increased the potency of 1,10-phenanthroline till a limit, at which Hill slopes became close to unity. In the absence of EDTA, the inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline was only weakly affected by the substrate concentration. On the other hand, competition between 1,10-phenanthroline and the substrate took place in the presence of EDTA. Similar findings were reported for the related metallopeptidase cystinyl aminopeptidase and point towards a model in which 1,10-phenanthroline inhibit enzyme activity by decreasing the free Zn2+ concentration. Moreover, EDTA is capable of removing a modulatory ion from an allosteric site at the enzyme, facilitating the direct interaction between 1,10-phenanthroline and the catalytic Zn2+. Compatible with this model, Ca2+ may bind to this allosteric site resulting in the potentiation of Zn2+-mediated re-activation of the enzyme activity in the presence of EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline.","Vanderheyden, Patrick M L; Demaegdt, Heidi; Swales, Julie; Lenaerts, Pieter-Jan; De Backer, Jean-Paul; Vogel, Lotte K; Vauquelin, Georges",Fundamental & clinical pharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17109655/,150

Following nationwide lockdowns, it becomes pertinent that the self-quarantined medical students are able to dispense necessary knowledge regarding appropriate prevention practices related to the disease to their respective families and communities, therefore playing a positive role in sharing the economic load of the health system already overburdened by the increasing number of COVID-19 patients. This study aims to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of undergraduate medical students of the Twin Cities of Pakistan toward COVID-19, with regards to their observance of precautionary measures against the disease. METHODS Online data in this descriptive cross- sectional study was collected through self-developed questionnaires from 267 undergraduate medical students of twin cities, by convenient sampling. RESULTS High level of knowledge (72.7%) regarding Covid-19 infection among undergraduate medical students was consistent with their practices (70.8%) but not with their satisfactory attitude (p<0.01). Being female than male and students of private medical colleges showed more satisfactory attitude (p<0.05) and knowledge (p<0.01) towards Covid-19 infection respectively, while practices were more among the students of public sector medical college (p<0.05).

189738,Regulation of N-glycolylneuraminic acid biosynthesis in developing pig small intestine.,2003,"In March 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) investigated a large hemorrhagic fever (HF) outbreak in Uige Province in northern Angola, West Africa. In total, 15 initial specimens were sent to CDC, Atlanta, Ga., for testing for viruses associated with viral HFs known to be present in West Africa, including ebolavirus. Marburgvirus was also included despite the fact that the origins of all earlier outbreaks were linked directly to East Africa. Surprisingly, marburgvirus was confirmed (12 of 15 specimens) as the cause of the outbreak. The outbreak likely began in October 2004 and ended in July 2005, and it included 252 cases and 227 (90%) fatalities (report from the Ministry of Health, Republic of Angola, 2005), making it the largest Marburg HF outbreak on record. A real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay utilized and adapted during the outbreak proved to be highly sensitive and sufficiently robust for field use. Partial marburgvirus RNA sequence analysis revealed up to 21% nucleotide divergence among the previously characterized East African strains, with the most distinct being Ravn from Kenya (1987). The Angolan strain was less different ( approximately 7%) from the main group of East African marburgviruses than one might expect given the large geographic separation. To more precisely analyze the virus genetic differences between outbreaks and among viruses within the Angola outbreak itself, a total of 16 complete virus genomes were determined, including those of the virus isolates Ravn (Kenya, 1987) and 05DRC, 07DRC, and 09DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo, 1998) and the reference Angolan virus isolate (Ang1379v). In addition, complete genome sequences were obtained from RNAs extracted from 10 clinical specimens reflecting various stages of the disease and locations within the Angolan outbreak. While the marburgviruses exhibit high overall genetic diversity (up to 22%), only 6.8% nucleotide difference was found between the West African Angolan viruses and the majority of East African viruses, suggesting that the virus reservoir species in these regions are not substantially distinct. Remarkably few nucleotide differences were found among the Angolan clinical specimens (0 to 0.07%), consistent with an outbreak scenario in which a single (or rare) introduction of virus from the reservoir species into the human population was followed by person-to-person transmission with little accumulation of mutations. This is in contrast to the 1998 to 2000 marburgvirus outbreak, where evidence of several virus genetic lineages (with up to 21% divergence) and multiple virus introductions into the human population was found.","Towner, Jonathan S; Khristova, Marina L; Sealy, Tara K; Vincent, Martin J; Erickson, Bobbie R; Bawiec, Darcy A; Hartman, Amy L; Comer, James A; Zaki, Sherif R; Ströher, Ute; Gomes da Silva, Filomena; del Castillo, Fernando; Rollin, Pierre E; Ksiazek, Thomas G; Nichol, Stuart T",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16775337/,150

This is quite the norm since most models lack the higher-order structure necessary to describe large gatherings. Through a higher-order description of contagions on networks, we find that epidemics can suddenly collapse when interventions operate over groups of individuals rather than at the level of individuals themselves.

191493,Heterogeneity detector: finding heterogeneous positions in Phred/Phrap assemblies.,2004,"BACKGROUND Response assessment is critical in evaluating effectiveness of anticancer treatment. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are associated with significant clinical benefit but may not result in significant tumor size reduction. Thus standard size-based response assessment with RECIST is insensitive, resulting in low response rates which do not reflect disease control measured by time to progression. We compared the use of combined size and density response criteria with standard size based criteria in metastatic RCC patients treated with TKI's. RESULTS Partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) defined by modified criteria successfully identified patients with a long TTP (448 days) or short TTP (89 days) respectively (p = 0.002). Neither RECIST nor standard Choi criteria successfully discriminated between patients having a short or long clinical benefit. PATIENTS AND METHODS CT scans from 32 patients with metastatic RCC treated with either sunitinib (18) or cediranib (14) were assessed. Twelve patients were excluded from the analysis as ten had non-contrast enhanced scans due to renal impairment and two stopped treatment due to toxicity. Scans from 20 evaluable patients at baseline and 12 w on treatment were assessed using RECIST, Choi and modified criteria in which both a 10% decrease in size and 15% decrease in density were required to define a partial response (PR). Response assessment performed using each of the three methods was compared with time to disease progression (TTP) defined by RECIST using Kaplan-Meier statistics and Log-rank test with significance at 5%. CONCLUSION A combined reduction in both size and arterial phase density of RCC metastases treated with TKIs correlates with TTP. RECIST and standard Choi criteria appear inferior.","Nathan, Paul D; Vinayan, Anup; Stott, David; Juttla, Jaspal; Goh, Vicky",Cancer biology & therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20009542/,150

Necropsies revealed no gross lesions, but microscopic lesions consisted of a nonsuppurative polioencephalomyelitis, most severe in the brain stem and spinal cord. The lesions were most consistent with a viral infection. Tests for circovirus, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, coronavirus, Rabies virus, and Pseudorabies virus were negative. Using immunohistochemistry, virus neutralization, fluorescent antibody test, and nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Porcine teschovirus was identified in tissues from affected individuals.

195758,Express delivery.,2003,"RATIONALE There is currently no optimal treatment or effective drug for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), because the immunopathologic mechanism is poorly understood. OBJECTIVES To explore the immune mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of SARS, we studied the expression profile of cytokines/chemokines in the blood and the immunopathology of the lung and lymphoid tissues. METHODS Fourteen cytokines/chemokines in the blood of 23 patients with SARS were dynamically screened, using a bead-based multiassay system. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify mRNA. Histopathology of the lung and lymphoid tissues at autopsy was examined, using methods of immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence staining. MAIN RESULTS Interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) was markedly elevated in the blood during the early stage of SARS, and remained at a high level until convalescence. Moreover, IP-10 was highly expressed in both lung and lymphoid tissues, where monocyte-macrophage infiltration and depletion of lymphocytes were observed. The levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were concomitantly increased in the blood of the patients with superinfection, and the mRNAs for these cytokines were also increased in lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS Induction of IP-10 is a critical event in the initiation of immune-mediated acute lung injury and lymphocyte apoptosis during the development of SARS. Superinfection after the immune injury is the main cause of death. The prompt elevation of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 is a sign of superinfection, indicating a high risk of death.","Jiang, Yong; Xu, Jun; Zhou, Chengzhi; Wu, Zhenguo; Zhong, Shuqing; Liu, Jinghua; Luo, Wei; Chen, Tao; Qin, Qinghe; Deng, Peng",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15657466/,150

Designated clinicians in sentinel adult and paediatric intensive care units (ICU/ PICUs) reported USII using an online reporting tool or provided a weekly nil notification. Reported cases were investigated for epidemiological links. A pilot study was undertaken for six months between January and July 2011 to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the system. In this six-month period, 5 adults and 13 children were reported by six participating units (3 ICUs, 3 PICUs). Of these 18 patients, 12 were reported within four days after admission to an ICU/PICU. Nine patients were subsequently diagnosed and were thus excluded from the surveillance. Therefore, only nine cases of USII were reported. No clustering was identified.On the basis of the pilot study, we conclude that the system is able to detect cases of USII and is feasible and acceptable to users. USII surveillance has been extended to a total of 19 sentinel units in London and the south-east of England during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.","Heinsbroek, E; Said, B; Kirkbride, H",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22874459/,150

Besides these predominating glomerulopathies, a wide range of other renal lesions, like acute tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis, calcinosis, and amyloidosis, were present. Pathological expression of collagen type IV, complement C3, fibronectin, and IgG was demonstrated in the glomeruli of the cheetah kidneys with the use of the avidin-biotin complex method.

Influenza virus illustrates the interaction of factors that limit the transmission and subsequent establishment of an infection in a novel host species. Influenza species barriers can be categorized into virus-host interactions occurring within individuals and host-host interactions, either within or between species, that affect transmission between individuals. Viral evolution can help surmount species barriers, principally by affecting virus-host interactions; however, evolving the capability for sustained transmission in a new host species represents a major adaptive challenge because the number of mutations required is often large.","Kuiken, Thijs; Holmes, Edward C; McCauley, John; Rimmelzwaan, Guus F; Williams, Catherine S; Grenfell, Bryan T",Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16627737/,150

In addition to the classic ELISA variants using antigen or antibody to coat the plastic plates, there has recently been growing interest in the application of fixed-cell ELISA to research and diagnostic work on viral diseases. The authors discuss the development and applications of this technique to basic research and diagnosis of transmissible gastroenteritis, a highly contagious disease of swine. The success of this technique, as the name suggests, is largely due to the use of a suitable fixative, which preserves the antigenicity of the neo-synthesised viral proteins, and the presence of optimal conditions for viral antigen synthesis. In addition, various parameters are optimised, and this is discussed with reference to transmissible gastroenteritis virus. These parameters would help veterinarians and research workers to develop this technique in their own laboratories.","Tô, L T; Bernard, S; Aynaud, J M",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8400392/,150
197636,Large-scale spatial-transmission models of infectious disease.,2007,"Porcine reproductive-respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a key agent in multifactorial respiratory disease of swine. Intratracheal administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) to PRRSV-infected pigs results in markedly enhanced respiratory disease, whereas the inoculation of each component alone results in largely subclinical disease. This study examines whether PRRSV-LPS-induced respiratory disease is associated with the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs. Gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated intratracheally with PRRSV and then with LPS at 3, 5, 7, 10, or 14 days of infection and euthanatized 6 h after LPS inoculation. Controls were inoculated with PRRSV or LPS only or with phosphate-buffered saline. Virus titers, (histo)pathological changes in the lungs, numbers of inflammatory cells, and bioactive tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were examined. All pigs inoculated with PRRSV-LPS developed severe respiratory disease, whereas the controls that were inoculated with PRRSV or LPS alone did not. PRRSV infection significantly enhanced cytokine production in response to LPS. Peak TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6 titers were 10 to 100 times higher in the PRRSV-LPS-inoculated pigs than in the pigs inoculated with PRRSV or LPS alone; and the titers correlated with the respiratory signs. The levels of neutrophil infiltration and the pathological changes detected in the lungs of PRRSV-LPS-inoculated pigs resembled those detected when the effects of PRRSV and LPS inoculated alone are combined, but with no synergistic effects between PRRSV and LPS. These data demonstrate a synergism between PRRSV and LPS in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and an association between induction of these cytokines and disease.","van Gucht, Steven; van Reeth, Kristien; Pensaert, Maurice",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12624016/,150
197659,The role of infectious aerosols in disease transmission in pigs.,1999,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects B lymphocytes and epithelial cells. While the glycoproteins required for entry into these two cell types differ, the gH/gL glycoprotein complex is essential for entry into both epithelial and B cells. Analysis of gH protein sequences from three gammaherpesviruses (EBV, marmoset, and rhesus) revealed a potential coiled-coil domain in the N terminus. Four leucines located in this region in EBV gH were replaced by alanines by site-directed mutagenesis and analyzed for cell-cell membrane fusion with B cells and epithelial cells. Reduction in fusion activity was observed for mutants containing L65A and/or L69A mutations, while substitutions in L55 and L74 enhanced the fusion activity of the mutant gH/gL complexes with both cell types. All of the mutants displayed levels of cell surface expression similar to those of wild-type gH and interacted with gL and gp42. The observation that a conservative mutation of leucine to alanine in the N terminus of EBV gH results in fusion-defective mutant gH/gL complexes is striking and points to an important role for this region in EBV-mediated membrane fusion with B lymphocytes and epithelial cells.","Omerović, Jasmina; Lev, Lori; Longnecker, Richard",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16160168/,150

198509,Prevalence of antiviral antibodies in workers handling wastewater and sludge.,1980,"Numerous RNA viruses generate subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs) for expression of their 3'-proximal genes. A major step in control of viral gene expression is the regulation of sgRNA synthesis by specific promoter elements. We used barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) as a model system to study transcriptional control in a virus with multiple sgRNAs. BYDV generates three sgRNAs during infection. The sgRNA1 promoter has been mapped previously to a 98-nucleotide (nt) region which forms two stem-loop structures. It was determined that sgRNA1 is not required for BYDV RNA replication in oat protoplasts. In this study, we show that neither sgRNA2 nor sgRNA3 is required for BYDV RNA replication. The promoters for sgRNA2 and sgRNA3 synthesis were mapped by using deletion mutagenesis. The minimal sgRNA2 promoter is approximately 143 nt long (nt 4810 to 4952) and is located immediately downstream of the putative sgRNA2 start site (nt 4809). The minimal sgRNA3 core promoter is 44 nt long (nt 5345 to 5388), with most of the sequence located downstream of sgRNA3 start site (nt 5348). For both promoters, additional sequences upstream of the start site enhanced sgRNA promoter activity. These promoters contrast to the sgRNA1 promoter, in which almost all of the promoter is located upstream of the transcription initiation site. Comparison of RNA sequences and computer-predicted secondary structures revealed little or no homology between the three sgRNA promoter elements. Thus, a small RNA virus with multiple sgRNAs can have very different subgenomic promoters, which implies a complex system for promoter recognition and regulation of subgenomic RNA synthesis.","Koev, G; Miller, W A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10846080/,150

CPGs produce 'fictive' behaviours in vitro which parallel activity seen in intact animals. CPG networks have been identified in a wide variety of model organisms and have been shown to be critical for generating rhythmic behaviours such as swimming, walking, chewing and breathing. Work with CPG preparations has led to fundamental advances in neuroscience; however, most CPG preparations involve intensive dissections and require sophisticated electrophysiology equipment, making export to teaching laboratories problematic. Here we present an integrated approach for bringing the study of locomotor CPGs in Drosophila larvae into teaching laboratories. First, we present freely available genetic constructs that enable educators to express genetically encoded calcium indicators in cells of interest in the larval central nervous system. Next, we describe how to isolate the larval central nervous system and prepare it for live imaging. We then show how to modify standard compound microscopes to enable fluorescent imaging using 3D printed materials and inexpensive optical components. Finally, we show how to use the free image analysis programme ImageJ and freely available features in the signal analysis programme DataView to analyse rhythmic CPG activity in the larval CNS. Comparison of results to those obtained on research equipment shows that signal-to-noise levels are comparable and core features of larval CPG activity can be observed. Overall, this work shows the viability of exporting live imaging experiments to low cost environments and paves the way for new teaching laboratory exercises revolving around optical imaging of CPG activity.","Booth, Jonathan R H; Sane, Varun; Gather, Malte C; Pulver, Stefan R","Journal of undergraduate neuroscience education : JUNE : a publication of FUN, Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33880100/,150

MATERIALS AND METHODS Radiographic findings were reviewed by two radiologists for 52 patients with SARS. On each radiograph, each lung was separated into upper, middle, and lower zones. A four-point scale was used to score extent of SARS-related lesions in each zone; points from all zones were added for a cumulative score. Patient sex, age, comorbidities, duration of developing lesions, lesion score for each radiograph, need for mechanical ventilation, and percentage of lung affected were compared between patients who died (n = 20) and survivors (n = 32). Continuous and categorical variables were analyzed with Mann-Whitney test and Fisher exact or chi(2) test, respectively. RESULTS Survival and mortality groups showed no significant differences with respect to patient sex, duration of SARS-related lesions, development of lesion shifting, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients who died were significantly older (mean +/- standard deviation, 56.9 years +/- 17.2 vs 40.4 years +/- 16.6; P =.002) and had higher frequency of comorbid lung illnesses (nine of 20 vs two of 32, P =.001), maximal lesion extent score of 7 or higher (20 of 20 vs five of 32, P <.001), involvement of four or more lung zones (17 of 20 vs four of 32, P <.001), bilateral lung involvement (19 of 20 vs 14 of 32, P <.001), need for mechanical ventilation (18 of 20 vs two of 32, P <.001), and higher percentage of affected areas (41.5% +/- 8.6 vs 16.4% +/- 10.0, P <.001) than those of survivors.

Conditional-independence network analysis revealed primary correlates of disease severity, including gene expression signatures of apoptosis in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and attenuated inflammation but increased fatty acid metabolism in CD56dimCD16hi NK cells linked positively to circulating interleukin (IL)-15. CD8+ T cell activation was apparent without signs of exhaustion. Although cellular inflammation was depressed in severe patients early after hospitalization, it became elevated by days 17-23 post symptom onset, suggestive of a late wave of inflammatory responses.

206575,Viral Alarm: When Fury Overcomes Fear,2020,"Disease prevention behaviour is essential during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. How people respond to information and regulations to control this infectious disease can be influenced by their age and generational identity. An individual with an optimal level of psychological flexibility can adapt to challenging situations more efficiently. Hence, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the moderating effect of generation on the relationship between psychological flexibility and COVID-19 preventive behaviour among different generational cohorts of women (baby boomers, X, Y, and Z). This relationship was rarely addressed in the literature, which is what inspired this study. Data were collected through an online survey. The responses of 834 Hungarian speaking women between the ages of 18 and 75 years old were successfully gathered. Four generational cohorts were represented in the sample population: baby boomers (age &gt; 56), X (age 41-55), Y (age 24-40), and Z (age 18-25). The moderation effect was calculated using the PROCESS macro in SPSS. A statistically significant moderation effect of generation was found on the relationship between psychological flexibility and COVID-19 prevention behaviour and the interaction added a small but significant contribution to the final model predicting preventive behaviour. In Generation Z, psychological flexibility predicted an increase in preventive behaviour, but no significant prediction was found among other generational cohorts. Females in their twenties seemed to be more engaged in COVID-19 prevention behaviour, if their psychological flexibility was higher, but failed to comply with health recommendations and safety protocols at low levels of flexibility. This study may provide a new perspective on how generational cohorts can influence the effect of psychological factors on COVID-19 preventive behaviour. Prevention of avoidance behaviours and facilitation of acceptance is definitory for psychologically flexible behaviours, while disease avoidance is crucial in prevention behaviour of COVID-19. Further research is needed to clarify our findings.","Kotta, Ibolya Szabo Kinga Marschalko Eszter Eniko Jancso-Farcas Susana Kalcza-Janosi Kinga",Journal of International Women&#039;s Studies,,150

Treatment efficacy with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors was found similar to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab in untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with a mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene. To identify patients who specifically benefit from fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab, we developed integrative models including established prognostic parameters and gene expression profiling. Gene expression profiling was conducted on n=337 CLL8 trial samples, ""core"" probe sets were summarized on gene levels and RMA normalized. Prognostic models were built using penalized Cox proportional hazards models with the smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty. We identified a prognostic signature of less than a dozen genes, which substituted for established prognostic factors, including TP53 and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene mutation status. Independent prognostic impact was confirmed for treatment, ß2-microglobulin and del(17p) regarding overall survival and for treatment, del(11q), del(17p) and SF3B1 mutation for progression-free survival. The combination of independent prognostic and gene expression profiling variables performed equal to models including only established non-gene expression profiling variables. Gene expression profiling variables showed higher prognostic accuracy for patients with long progression-free survival compared to categorical variables like the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene mutation status and reliably predicted overall survival in CLL8 and an independent cohort. Gene expression profiling based prognostic models can help to identify patients who specifically benefit from fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab treatment.

Its expression is known to be upregulated under heat shock. This protein interacts with different partners and can, therefore, be involved in various processes relevant to tissue integrity and functioning. In humans, mutations in the gene encoding Hspb8 can lead to the development of various diseases such as myopathies and neuropathies. In our study, we aimed to perform an in-depth characterization of zebrafish Hspb8 during zebrafish development. We applied techniques such as RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, LC-MS, and morpholino-mediated knockdown. We broadened the knowledge regarding zebrafish hspb8 expression during development under normal and heat shock conditions as well as its tissue- and subcellular-specific localization. A co-IP analysis allowed us to conclude that zebrafish Hspb8 can interact with proteins such as Bag3 and Hsc70, which are crucial for formation of an autophagy-inducing complex. We also demonstrated that hspb8 morpholino-mediated knockdown has an impact on zebrafish embryos' morphology, muscle ultrastructure, and motility behavior. Our research provides a valuable resource for the potential use of the zebrafish as a model for studying pathological conditions associated with hspb8 disorders.","Dubinska-Magiera, Magda; Niedbalska-Tarnowska, Joanna; Migocka-Patrzalek, Marta; Posyniak, Ewelina; Daczewska, Malgorzata",,,150

This study aims to validate customer barriers to ABS focusing on the contamination barrier. As service employees’ presence violates the COVID-19 physical distancing norms and heightens contamination fear, this paper tests its effects on continued use intentions of ABS. This study also empirically examines the role of conspicuous virtue signaling and organizational response. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted in the context of scooter sharing and uses a mixed-method to explore the relatively under-researched problem of contamination fear in ABS. Study one uses the survey method and study two uses a 2 × 2 matrix between-subject design. Findings: The results reveal that perceptions of resource sufficiency positively affect continued use intentions of ABS. The presence of a service employee hurts continued use intentions. Further, there are a three-way interaction between ABS type (service employee presence/absence), organizational response (solution-oriented/general information) and resource sufficiency perceptions. Organizational response mitigates the negative effect of service employee presence on the link between resource adequacy perceptions and ABS continued use intentions. Originality/value: In contrast with prior research, this study shows that contamination fear invokes protection motivation, resulting in better preparedness and continued use intentions of ABS. The predicted difference is primarily between customers who attribute responsibility and ABS type differently (presence/absence of service employee).

Vaccination against SARS-COV-2 holds promise for reduction in COVID-19. This operational analysis describes the proportion of SARS-COV-2 positive tests before, during, and after vaccination. DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis from October 1, 2020 until February 14, 2021. SETTING: A total of 130 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living Centers (CLC), analogous to nursing homes. INTERVENTION: Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. MEASUREMENTS: The primary measure is the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among CLC residents. In a pooled analysis of weekly testing and vaccine data, the proportion of positive tests was compared for the unvaccinated, first dose, and second dose. For each CLC, we identified the week in which 50% of CLC residents were vaccinated (index week). The analysis aligned the index week for CLCs and examined the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests at the CLC level before and after. As a reference, we plotted the proportion of positive tests in nursing homes in the same county as the CLC using publicly reported data. RESULTS: Within the pooled VA CLCs, the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was delivered to 50% of CLC residents within 1 week of availability and second dose within 5 weeks. Relative to the index week, the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in the vaccinated relative to unvaccinated was significantly lower in Week 4 (relative risk 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.68). Throughout the study period, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in community nursing homes was higher compared to VA CLC and also declined after vaccine availability. CONCLUSION: The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests significantly declined in VA CLCs 4 weeks after vaccine delivery and continued to decline in vaccinated and unvaccinated residents. The results describe the importance of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and vaccination in VA nursing home residents.","Rudolph, James L; Hartronft, Scotte; McConeghy, Kevin; Kennedy, Michael; Intrator, Orna; Minor, Lisa; Hubert, Terrence L; Goldstein, Mary K",J. am. geriatr. soc,,150

Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed for a five-week period from 20 March 2020 and the same time period in 2019. The primary outcome was mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19 infection, perioperative pulmonary complications, time to theatre, type of anaesthesia, operation, grade of surgeon, fracture type, postoperative intensive care admission, venous thromboembolism, dislocation, infection rates, and length of stay. Results: In all, 76 patients with hip fractures were identified in each group. All patients had 30-day follow-up. There was no difference in age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification or residence at time of injury. However, three in each group were not fit for surgery. No significant difference was found in 30-day mortality; ten patients (13%) in 2019 and 11 patients (14%) in 2020 (p = 0.341). In the 2020 cohort, ten patients tested positive for COVID-19, two (20%) of whom died. There was no significant increase in postoperative pulmonary complications. Median time to theatre was 20 hours (interquartile range (IQR) 16 to 25) in 2019 versus 23 hours (IQR 18 to 30) in 2020 (p = 0.130). Regional anaesthesia increased from 24 (33%) cases in 2019 to 46 (63%) cases in 2020, but ten (14%) required conversion to general anaesthesia. In both groups, 53 (70%) operations were done by trainees. Hemiarthroplasty for 31 B type fractures was the most common operation. No significant difference was found for intensive care admission or 30-day venous thromboembolism, dislocation or infection, or length of stay.

In March 2020, the EDs of New York-Presbyterian Hospital, a 10-hospital health system in the region, began to experience a rapid surge in patients with COVID-19 symptoms. Emergency physicians were faced with a disease that they knew little about that quickly overwhelmed resources. A significant amount of attention has been placed on the problem of limited supply of ventilators and intensive care beds for critically ill patients in the setting of the ongoing global pandemic. Relatively less has been given to the issue that precedes it: the demand on resources posed by patients who are not yet critically ill but are unwell enough to seek care in the ED. We describe here how at one institution, a cross-campus ED physician working group produced a care pathway to guide clinicians and ensure the fair and effective allocation of resources in the setting of the developing public health crisis. This 'crisis clinical pathway' focused on using clinical evaluation for medical decision making and maximising benefit to patients throughout the system.","Suh, Edward Hyun; Bodnar, David J; Melville, Laura D; Sharma, Manish; Farmer, Brenna M",Emerg Med J,,150

Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are manufactured fluorinated chemicals widely used in many industrial and household products. The objective of this case-control study was to assess the association between PFASs exposure and COVID-19 susceptibility and to elucidate the metabolic dysregulation associated with PFASs exposure in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Total 160 subjects (80 COVID-19 patients and 80 symptom-free controls) were recruited from Shanxi and Shandong provinces, two regions heavily polluted by PFASs in China. Twelve common PFASs were quantified in both urine and serum. Urine metabolome profiling was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: In unadjusted models, the risk of COVID-19 infection was positively associated with urinary levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (Odds ratio: 2.29 [95% CI: 1.52-3.22]), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (2.91, [1.95-4.83], and total PFASs (&#8721; (12) PFASs) (3.31, [2.05-4.65]). After controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), the associations remained statistically significant (Adjusted odds ratio of 1.94 [95% CI: 1.39-2.96] for PFOS, 2.73 [1.71-4.55] for PFOA, and 2.82 [1.97-3.51] for &#8721; (12) PFASs). Urine metabolome-PFASs association analysis revealed that 59% of PFASs-associated urinary endogenous metabolites in COVID-19 patients were identified to be produced or largely regulated by mitochondrial function. In addition, the increase of PFASs exposure was associated with the accumulation of key metabolites in kynurenine metabolism, which are involved in immune responses (Combined ß coefficient of 0.60 [95% CI: 0.25-0.95, P = 0.001]). Moreover, alternations in PFASs-associated metabolites in mitochondrial and kynurenine metabolism were also correlated with clinical lab biomarkers for mitochondrial function (serum growth/differentiation factor-15) and immune activity (lymphocyte percentage), respectively. CONCLUSION: Elevated exposure to PFASs was independently associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. PFASs-associated metabolites were implicated in mitochondrial function and immune activity. Larger studies are needed to confirm our findings and further understand the underlying mechanisms of PFASs exposure in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection.","Ji, Junjun; Song, Lingyan; Wang, Jing; Yang, Zhiyun; Yan, Haotian; Li, Ting; Yu, Li; Jian, Lingyu; Jiang, Feixiang; Li, Junfeng; Zheng, Jinping; Li, Kefeng",Environ Int,,150
226084,Protecting-group-free synthesis of hydroxyesters from amino alcohols,2020,"AimsAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic there was significant uncertainty for the NHS and it's workforce. Within psychiatry, there was an expectation that junior doctors would be redeployed, with senior psychiatrists stepping down to cover physical health and on-call duties.Senior leadership in mental health trusts were also preparing for COVID-19 outbreaks on psychiatric wards and were developing strategies for managing a novel illness with a poorly understood clinical course. Many psychiatrist expressed anxieties around their competency in assessing and managing acutely physically unwell patients in a mental health setting.This project aimed to improve confidence of psychiatrists in core physical health competencies through devising and delivering an evolving SBE package.MethodSussex Partnership Foundation Trust redeployed two higher trainees from their simulation faculty to work full time on developing a SBE package. This was requested by senior leadership to deliver training about assessing and managing physically unwell patients in the context of COVID-19. This training was devised as a 90 minute didactic lecture following by 90 minutes of SBE.This was delivered at 6 sites through 10 opt-in sessions available to all doctors in the trust over 4 weeks. Pre and post-course questionnaires were given to all participants to measure the effect.Result102 medical staff attended the SBE workshops. Feedback was completed by 93 (91%) doctors prior to the course and 97 (95%) post. Before the workshop, 33% did not feel they had a structured approach for assessing an acutely unwell patient, which reduced to 0% after completing the course.On a 5-point Likert scale, confidence in managing COVID-19 symptoms increased from 2.54/5 to 4.07/5 overall with 89% of doctors feeling “confident” or “very confident”. There were similar increases in confidence in managing critically unwell patients (2.7/5 pre;3.95/5 post) and in identifying alternative causes for acutely unwell patients (2.63/5 pre;4.02/5 post).ConclusionThis project demonstrates that SBE is an effective way to rapidly develop effective interventions for the medical workforce, increasing confidence in the face of significant uncertainty and reducing anxiety within the system to meet the learning needs identified by medical leadership.As part of this project Sussex Partnership Medical Education freely shared the workshop materials, which were later adopted and used by psychiatry departments internationally.","McEwan, Craig Kerslake Richard Hobkirk Michael",BJPsych Open,,150

227373,Solving Structured Hierarchical Games Using Differential Backward Induction,2021-06-08,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has catapulted virtual online learning to the forefront of medical education as training programs adapt to physical distancing challenges while maintaining the rigorous standards of medical training. SoMe offers a unique and partially untapped potential to supplement formal medical education. OBJECTIVE: We detail a summary of the incentives, applications, challenges, and pitfalls of SoMe based medical education for both trainees and educators. METHODS: We performed a literature review via PubMed on medical research involving social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, and podcasts. Papers were reviewed for inclusion based on the integrity and power of the study. RESULTS: The unique characteristics of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube. WhatsApp, and podcasts endow them with unique communication capabilities that serve different educational purposes in both the formal and informal education setting. However contemporary medical education curricula lack widespread guidance on meaningful use, application and deployment of social media in medical education. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and institutions must evolve to embrace the use of SoMe platforms for medical education. Healthcare professionals can approach SoMe engagement in the same ethical manner that they would with patients in real life but healthcare institutions ultimately must enable their healthcare professionals to do so by enacting realistic social media policies. Institutions should appoint clinicians with strong social media experience to leadership roles in order to spearhead these generational and cultural changes. Further studies are needed to better understand how healthcare professionals can best utilize social media as educational tools most effectively. Ultimately social media is here to stay influencing lay public knowledge and trainee knowledge. Clinicians and institutions must embrace this complementary modality of trainee education and champion social media as a novel distribution platform that can also help propagate truth in a time of misinformation.","Katz, Marc Neill; Nandi, Neilanjan",,,150
228671,Abstract Journal Trainees Association,2021,"CONTEXT.: Pathology practices have begun integrating digital pathology tools into their routine workflow. During 2020 the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged as a pandemic causing a global health crisis that significantly affected the world population in several areas, including medical practice, and pathology was no exception. OBJECTIVE.: To summarize our experience in implementing digital pathology for remote primary diagnosis, education and research during this pandemic. DESIGN.: We surveyed our pathologists (all subspecialized) and trainees to gather information about their use of digital pathology tools before and during the pandemic. Quality assurance and slide distribution data were also examined. RESULTS.: During the pandemic, the widespread usage of digital tools in our institution allowed a smooth transition of most clinical and academic activities into remote with no major disruptions. The number of pathologists using whole slide imaging (WSI) for primary diagnosis increased from 20 (62.5%) to 29 (90.6%) out of a total 32 (100 %) pathologists, excluding renal pathology and hematopathology, during the pandemic. Furthermore, the number of pathologists exclusively using WSI for primary diagnosis also increased from 2 (6.3%) to 5 (15.6%) during the pandemic from the total of 32 (100%) pathologists. From 35 (100%) survey responses from attending pathologists, 21 (65.6%) reported using WSI for remote primary diagnosis following the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services waiver. Of these 21 pathologists, 18 (87%) responded that if allowed, they will continue using WSI for remote primary diagnosis after the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS.: The pandemic served as a catalyst to pathologists adopting a digital workflow into their daily practice and realizing the logistic and technical advantages of such tools.","Lujan, Giovanni M; Savage, Johanna; Shana039,; ah, Arwa; Yearsley, Martha; Thomas, Diana; Allenby, Patricia; Otero, Jose; Limbach, Abberley Lott; Cui, Xiaoyan; Scarl, Rachel; Hardy, Tanner; Sheldon, Jesse; Plaza, Jose; Whitaker, Bonnie; Frankel, Wendy; Parwani, Anil; Li, Zaibo",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

The resulting health crisis and widespread fear have triggered labor shortage problems such as high job vacancy rate and low labor participation rate. Thus, how to increase the labor supply has become a hotspot among scholars. We aimed to analyze the influences of public medical insurance system on labor health status and supply. Method: Using the China Health and Nutrition Survey five-phase panel data, the new rural cooperative medical system was taken as an example to empirically analyze the influences of public medical insurance system on the individual health status and labor supply via the panel Tobit model and panel binary Logit model. The analysis revealed the mediating effect of health status. Results: First, Public medical insurance system could significantly improve individual health status. Second, public medical insurance system will lengthen the labor supply time and elevate the labor supply rate by improving individual health status. Third, the influences of public medical insurance system on labor health status and supply vary with gender and age. Conclusion: Public medical insurance system will generate positive influences on labor health status and labor supply. Hence, perfecting the public medical insurance system is able to mitigate the negative impacts of population aging and pandemic on the labor supply. © 2021 Bai et al.","Bai, B.; Zhang, Y.; Liu, Y.",Iranian Journal of Public Health,,150

Hence, we sought to assess the association of permanent AF with in-hospital outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single-centered, retrospective, observational study including consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome for the study was defined as all cause in-hospital mortality. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with AF were compared to patients without AF. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median age of 55 years, 55.4% men) were enrolled. Of them 40 (11.4%) had AF. Patients with AF were older; were more likely to have co-morbidities, abnormal chest radiography findings and deteriorated laboratory parameters such as D-dimer, troponin, albumin, urea. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with AF compared to patients without AF (32.5% vs. 13.5%, log-rank p = 0.002, RR 2.40). The number of patients who needed intensive care unit (55% vs. 31%, p = 0.002) and invasive mechanical ventilation (35% vs 15.2%, p = 0.002) were also higher in the AF group. In addition, length of in-hospital stay was longer in patients with AF (median 8 vs. 7 days, p = 0.008). After adjustment for age and co-morbidities, multivariable analyses revealed that AF (HR: 2.426, 95% CI: 1.089-5.405, p = 0.032) was independently associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: AF was seen with together markers of severe COVID-19, and the presence of AF was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Özdemir, Ibrahim Halil; Özlek, Bülent; Çetin, Nurullah",J Electrocardiol,,150

232763,Contribution of ethology to evolutionary medicine,2021,"Common hospital and surgical center responses to the Covid-19 pandemic included curtailing ""elective"" procedures, which are typically determined based on implications for physical health and survival. However, in the focus solely on physical health and survival, procedures whose main benefits advance components of well-being beyond health, including self-determination, personal security, economic stability, equal respect, and creation of meaningful social relationships, have been disproportionately deprioritized. We describe how female reproduction-related procedures, including abortion, surgical sterilization, reversible contraception devices and in vitro fertilization, have been broadly categorized as ""elective,"" a designation that fails to capture the value of these procedures or their impact on women's overall well-being. We argue that corresponding restrictions and delays of these procedures are problematically reflective of underlying structural views that marginalize women's rights and interests and therefore threaten to propagate gender injustice during the pandemic and beyond. Finally, we propose a framework for triaging reproduction-related procedures during Covid-19 that is more individualized, accounts for their significance for comprehensive well-being, and can be used to inform resumption of operations as well as subsequent restriction phases.","Gross, Marielle S; Harrington, Bryna J; Sufrin, Carolyn B; Faden, Ruth R",Hastings Cent Rep,,150

During lockdown outpatient visits were limited and telemedicine (TM) was encouraged. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from continuous or flash glucose monitoring systems shared through different cloud systems during the lockdown by subjects with type 1 diabetes and compared data obtained 4 weeks before and 4 weeks after structured telephonic visit. Variables considered were mean glucose, time spent in target (70-180 mg/dl), hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dl) and hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dl), coefficient of variation, and length of sensor use. RESULTS: During the 4 weeks following the telephonic visit there was an improvement of glycemic control, with a significant reduction of mean glucose values (161.1 before vs 156.3 mg/dl after, p = 0.001), an increase of the time spent in target (63.6 vs 66.3, p = 0.0009) and a reduction of time spent in hyperglycemia (33.4 vs 30.5, p = 0.002). No changes were observed regarding glucose variability, time spent in hypoglycemia, and length of sensor use. Similar results were observed in subjects treated with multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.

Significant reductions in access to surgical treatment have forced surgeons to prioritise patients and follow strict COVID-19 protocols to protect surgeons, staff, and patients.1 Nosocomial infections among Cardiac Surgery patients have been reported and are associated with a high mortality.2 As a COVID-19 tertiary care centre and a tertiary cardiac centre, we tried to balance the need to operate on urgent cardiac cases while protecting patients and staff from COVID-19. During the first wave of the pandemic, a total of 579 surgeries were performed. We report findings from an outbreak of four nosocomial infections. All patients tested negative within 24 hours of surgery or admission. Three patients were positive following surgery, suggesting an overall nosocomial rate during the first wave of 0.5% (3/579). One patient admitted for evaluation tested positive during mass screening. Two of the four patients died following respiratory complications. No healthcare worker (HCW) or family member with direct contact with these patients tested positive for COVID-19. Nosocomial COVID-19 infection is uncommon when adhering to safety protocols. Although uncommon, the mortality rate is high (50%) in our series. As widespread vaccination of HCWs and high-risk individuals susceptible to COVID-19 is in progress, we suggest that cardiac surgery patients, when feasible, be vaccinated prior to surgery given this could prevent excess mortality, protect HCWs and reduce resource use.","Ridwan, Khalid; DeVarennes, Benoit; Tchervenkov, Christo; Shum-Tim, Dominique; Cecere, Renzo; Lachapelle, Dr Kevin",,,150

With the exponential increase of patients worldwide, the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is being better defined and new symptoms are emerging. Numerous reports are documenting the occurrence of different cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To provide a brief overview of cutaneous lesions associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A literature search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases up to 30 April 2020. This narrative review summarizes the available data regarding the clinical and histological features of COVID-19-associated skin manifestations. RESULTS: The literature reports showed a great heterogeneity in COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations, as well as in their latency periods and associated extracutaneous symptoms. Pathogenic mechanisms are unknown, although the roles of a hyperactive immune response, complement activation and microvascular injury have been hypothesized. Based on our experience and the literature data, we subdivided the reported cutaneous lesions into six main clinical patterns: (i) urticarial rash; (ii) confluent erythematous-maculopapular-morbilliform rash; (iii) papulovesicular exanthem; (iv) chilblain-like acral pattern; (v) livedo reticularis-livedo racemosa-like pattern; and (vi) purpuric 'vasculitic' pattern. These six patterns can be merged into two main groups: the first - inflammatory and exanthematous - includes the first three groups listed above, and the second includes the vasculopathic and vasculitic lesions of the last three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The possible presence of cutaneous findings leading to suspect COVID-19 puts dermatologists in a relevant position. Further studies are needed to delineate the diagnostic and prognostic values of such cutaneous manifestations.","Marzano, A V; Cassano, N; Genovese, G; Moltrasio, C; Vena, G A",Br J Dermatol,,150

To provide information essential for understanding the biologic underpinnings of this association, we analyzed whole-transcriptome RNA expression data obtained from a large cohort of cancer patients to characterize expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and other proteases that are involved in viral attachment to and entry into target cells. We find substantial variability of expression of these factors across tumor types and identify subpopulations expressing ACE2 at very high levels. In some tumor types, especially in gastrointestinal cancers, expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is highly correlated. Furthermore, we found infiltration with T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell infiltration to be particularly pronounced in ACE2-high tumors. These findings suggest that subsets of cancer patients exist with gene expression profiles that may be associated with heightened susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in whom malignant tumors function as viral reservoir and possibly promote the frequently detrimental hyper-immune response in patients infected with this virus.","Elliott, Andrew; Saul, Michelle; Zeng, Jia; Marshall, John L; Kim, Edward S; Nagasaka, Misako; Lenz, Heinz-Josef; Schwartzberg, Lee; Spetzler, David; Abraham, Jim; Xiu, Joanne; Stafford, Phillip; Michael Korn, W",Sci Rep,,150

Following World Health Organization (WHO) and health care authorities around the World recommendations, all elective surgeries from benign diagnose procedures must be postponed and imperatively continue working on emergent and oncological urgent pathologies. Surgical elective treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is not considered as a priority. During BPH endoscopic surgeries, urine and blood are mixed with the irrigation liquid implying a risk of viral presence. Furthermore, a steam and smoke bubble is being accumulated inside the bladder implying the risk of splashing and aerosols. The risks of other viral infections have been identified during endourological procedures and they are related to splashing events. Several studies observed 33-100% of splashing on goggles. All BPH endoscopic procedures must be postponed. In case of complete urinary obstruction, this event can be adequately treated by urethral or suprapubic catheter under local anesthesia. As soon as local COVID-19 prevalence decreases, endourological procedures could be restarted. As protocols are being validating around the World to redeem elective surgeries, a symptomatic obstructed patient could be operated knowing his COVID-19 status with a molecular PCR, a cleaned epidemiological interview with a normal preoperative protocol. If patient is COVID-19+, surgery must be delayed until complete recovery, because mortality could increase as Lei from Wuhan describes. Informed consent must include risks of complications related to COVID-19 disease. Surgery must be performed by an experienced surgeon in order to avoid increase of operating time and risks of complications.

243882,A Systematic Evaluation of Coding Strategies for Sparse Binary Images,2020-10-26,"In December 2019, a new virus called SARS-CoV-2 was reported in China and quickly spread to other parts of the world. The development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines has recently received much attention from numerous researchers. The present study aims to design an effective multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-COV-2 using the reverse vaccinology method. In this regard, structural proteins from SARS-COV-2, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, were selected as target antigens for epitope prediction. A total of five helper T lymphocytes (HTL) and five cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes were selected after screening the predicted epitopes for antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. Subsequently, the selected HTL and CTL epitopes were fused via flexible linkers. Next, the cholera toxin B-subunit (CTxB) as an adjuvant was linked to the N-terminal of the chimeric structure. The proposed vaccine was analyzed for the properties of physicochemical, antigenicity, and allergenicity. The 3D model of the vaccine construct was predicted and docked with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to evaluate the stable interactions between the vaccine construct and TLR4. The immune simulation was also conducted to explore the immune responses induced by the vaccine. Finally, in silico cloning of the vaccine construct into the pET-28 (+) vector was conducted. The results obtained from all bioinformatics analysis stages were satisfactory; however, in vitro and in vivo tests are essential to validate these results.","Sanami, Samira; Alizadeh, Morteza; Nosrati, Masoud; Dehkordi, Korosh Ashrafi; Azadegan-Dehkordi, Fatemeh; Tahmasebian, Shahram; Nosrati, Hamed; Arjmand, Mohammad-Hassan; Ghasemi-Dehnoo, Maryam; Rafiei, Ali; Bagheri, Nader",Comput Biol Med,,150
243935,Rigorous wildlife disease surveillance,2020,"Repurposed drugs that are safe and immediately available constitute a first line of defense against new viral infections. Despite limited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, several drugs are being tested as medication or as prophylaxis to prevent infection. Using a stochastic model of early phase infection, we evaluate the success of prophylactic treatment with different drug types to prevent viral infection. We find that there exists a critical efficacy that a treatment must reach in order to block viral establishment. Treatment by a combination of drugs reduces the critical efficacy, most effectively by the combination of a drug blocking viral entry into cells and a drug increasing viral clearance. Below the critical efficacy, the risk of infection can nonetheless be reduced. Drugs blocking viral entry into cells or enhancing viral clearance reduce the risk of infection more than drugs that reduce viral production in infected cells. The larger the initial inoculum of infectious virus, the less likely is prevention of an infection. In our model, we find that as long as the viral inoculum is smaller than 10 infectious virus particles, viral infection can be prevented almost certainly with drugs of 90% efficacy (or more). Even when a viral infection cannot be prevented, antivirals delay the time to detectable viral loads. The largest delay of viral infection is achieved by drugs reducing viral production in infected cells. A delay of virus infection flattens the within-host viral dynamic curve, possibly reducing transmission and symptom severity. Thus, antiviral prophylaxis, even with reduced efficacy, could be efficiently used to prevent or alleviate infection in people at high risk.","Czuppon, Peter; Débarre, Florence; Gonçalves, Antonio; Tenaillon, Olivier; Perelson, Alan S; Guedj, Jérémie; Blanquart, François",PLoS Comput Biol,,150
244905,Trends in COVID-19 therapeutic clinical trials,2021,"Currently countries are facing a new crisis caused by the COVID-19, which leads to the rise of government expenditures and additional borrowing. This situation highlights the importance of examine factors which determine the level of public debt that still sustains economic growth. A growing body of research supports the idea of a non-linear debt–growth relationship and estimates the threshold level above which debt becomes unsustainable and has a negative effect on output. The empirical evidence points out that there is no single sustainable debt threshold level that holds for all countries. This research complements scarce empirical evidence on the heterogeneous debt–growth relationship and provides some insights on the publicly available statistical indicators that might signal a relatively low/high expenditure multiplier and, at the same time, potentially unsustainable/sustainable growth stimulus through the use of borrowed funds. We test the hypothesis that the expenditure multiplier is shaping the impact of public debt on growth. Our empirical examination is based on panel data analysis in the groups of countries with expected relatively high and low expenditure multiplier. Research results show that a statistically significant negative marginal effect of debt on growth starts to manifest at a lower debt-to-GDP ratio when the expenditure multiplier is lower and vice-versa. The study shed some light on the sources of heterogeneity in a debt–growth relationship. We can conclude that countries with a high expenditure multiplier level can borrow more and sustain growth. In contrast, in countries with a lower expenditure multiplier, a relatively low debt level becomes unsustainable for growth.","Cibulskiene, Diana Garsviene Lina Seputiene Janina",Sustainability,,150
245487,Development of molecular and histological methods to evaluate stress oxidative biomarkers in sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax),2020,"OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is an emerging treatment modality that enables incisionless ablative neurosurgical procedures. Bilateral MRgFUS capsulotomy has recently been demonstrated to be safe and effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Preliminary evidence has suggested that bilateral MRgFUS capsulotomy can present increased difficulties in reaching lesional temperatures as compared to unilateral thalamotomy. The authors of this article aimed to study the parameters associated with successful MRgFUS capsulotomy lesioning and to present longitudinal radiographic findings following MRgFUS capsulotomy. METHODS: Using data from 22 attempted MRgFUS capsulotomy treatments, the authors investigated the relationship between various sonication parameters and the maximal temperature achieved at the intracranial target. Lesion volume and morphology were analyzed longitudinally using structural and diffusion tensor imaging. A retreatment procedure was attempted in one patient, and their postoperative imaging is presented. RESULTS: Skull density ratio (SDR), skull thickness, and angle of incidence were significantly correlated with the maximal temperature achieved. MRgFUS capsulotomy lesions appeared similar to those following MRgFUS thalamotomy, with three concentric zones observed on MRI. Lesion volumes regressed substantially over time following MRgFUS. Fractional anisotropy analysis revealed a disruption in white matter integrity, followed by a gradual return to near-baseline levels concurrent with lesion regression. In the patient who underwent retreatment, successful bilateral lesioning was achieved, and there were no adverse clinical or radiographic events. CONCLUSIONS: With the current iteration of MRgFUS technology, skull-related parameters such as SDR, skull thickness, and angle of incidence should be considered when selecting patients suitable for MRgFUS capsulotomy. Lesions appear to follow morphological patterns similar to what is seen following MRgFUS thalamotomy. Retreatment appears to be safe, although additional cases will be necessary to further evaluate the associated safety profile.","Davidson, Benjamin; Mithani, Karim; Huang, Yuexi; Jones, Ryan M; Goubran, Maged; Meng, Ying; Snell, John; Hynynen, Kullervo; Hamani, Clement; Lipsman, Nir",J Neurosurg,,150

METHODS: the COVID-19 integrated surveillance system is the result of a close and continuous collaboration between the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS), the Italian Ministry of Health, and the regional and local health authorities. Through a web platform, it collects individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and gathers information on their residence, laboratory diagnosis, hospitalisation, clinical status, risk factors, and outcome. Results, for different levels of aggregation and risk categories, are published daily and weekly on the ISS website, and made available to national and regional public health authorities; these results contribute one of the information sources of the regional monitoring and risk assessment system. RESULTS: the COVID-19 integrated surveillance system monitors the space-time distribution of cases and their characteristics. Indicators used in the weekly regional monitoring and risk assessment system include process indicators on completeness and results indicators on weekly trends of newly diagnosed cases per Region. CONCLUSIONS: the outputs of the integrated surveillance system for COVID-19 provide timely information to health authorities and to the general population on the evolution of the epidemic in Italy. They also contribute to the continuous re-assessment of risk related to transmission and impact of the epidemic thus contributing to the management of COVID-19 in Italy.","Del Manso, Martina; Andrianou, Xanthi; Urdiales, Alberto Mateo; Vescio, Maria Fenicia; Rota, Maria Cristina; Fabiani, Massimo; Boros, Stefano; Bellino, Stefania; Stefanelli, Paola; Ciervo, Alessandra; Punzo, Ornella; Filia, Antonietta; Tallon, Marco; Di Benedetto, Corrado; Spuri, Matteo; Pezzotti, Patrizio; Riccardo, Flavia; Bella, Antonella",Epidemiol Prev,,150

The Italian ColoRectal Anastomotic Leakage (iCral) study group collecting 43 Italian surgical centers experienced in colorectal surgery from multiple regions performed a quick survey to make a snapshot of the current situation. METHODS: A 25-items questionnaire was sent to the 43 principal investigators of the iCral study group, with questions regarding qualitative and quantitative aspects of the surgical activity before and after the COVID19 outbreak. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the centers were involved in the treatment of COVID19 cases. Intensive care units (ICU) beds were partially or totally reallocated for the treatment of COVID19 cases in 72% of the hospitals. Elective colorectal surgery for malignancy was stopped or delayed in nearly 30% of the centers, with less than 20% of them still scheduling elective colorectal resections for frail and comorbid patients needing postoperative ICU care. A significant reduction of the number of colorectal resections during the time span from January to March 2020 was recorded, with significant delay in treatment in more than 50% of the centers. DISCUSSION: Our survey confirms that COVID19 outbreak is severely affecting the activity of colorectal surgery centers participating to iCral study group. This could impact the activity of surgical centers for many months after the end of the emergency.","Caricato, Marco; Baiocchi, Gian Luca; Crafa, Francesco; Scabini, Stefano; Brisinda, Giuseppe; Clementi, Marco; Sica, Giuseppe; Delrio, Paolo; Longo, Graziano; Anania, Gabriele; de Manzini, Nicolò; Amodio, Pietro; Lucchi, Andrea; Baldazzi, Gianandrea; Garulli, Gianluca; Patriti, Alberto; Pirozzi, Felice; Pavanello, Maurizio; Carrara, Alessandro; Campagnacci, Roberto; Liverani, Andrea; Muratore, Andrea; Siquini, Walter; De Luca, Raffaele; Mancini, Stefano; Borghi, Felice; Di Cosmo, Mariantonietta; Persiani, Roberto; Pedrazzani, Corrado; Scaramuzzi, Matteo; Scatizzi, Marco; Vettoretto, Nereo; Totis, Mauro; Gennai, Andrea; Marini, Pierluigi; Basti, Massimo; Viola, Massimo; Ruffo, Giacomo; Catarci, Marco",Updates Surg,,150
264932,Towards GaAs Thin-Film Tracking Detectors,2021-07-12,"The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about renewed conversation about equality and equity in the distribution of medical resources. Much of the recent conversation has focused on creating and implementing policies in times of crisis when resources are exhausted. Depending on how the pandemic develops, some communities may implement crisis measures, but many health care facilities are currently experiencing shortages of staff and materials even if the facilities have not implemented crisis standards. There is a need for shared conversation about equality and equity in these times of contingency between conventional and crisis medicine. To respond well to these challenges, I recommend that institutions rely on policy, professional education, and ethics consultation. As is the case with crisis policies, creating contingency policies requires that health care professionals decide on how, specifically, to achieve equity. A policy is only as effective as its implementation; therefore, institutions should invest in context-specific education on contingency policies. Finally, ethics consultation should be available for questions that contingency policies cannot address.","Bibler, Trevor",Hastings Cent Rep,,150

This study aimed to examine psychosocial responses to COVID-19 using network analysis. A total of 1,500 urban residents of South Korea, selected from an online public panel, were surveyed using self-rating questionnaires addressing daily life changes, fear of infection, and distress related to COVID-19. Participants also completed a 10-item Perceived Stress Scale survey. We constructed regularized partial correlation networks, estimated global and local network metrics, tested network accuracy and stability, and compared the estimated networks between men and women. The network of the psychosocial responses consisted of 24 nodes that were classified into five groups: 'fear of infection', 'difficulty with outside activities', 'economic loss', 'altered eating and sleeping', and 'adaptive stress'. The node centralities indicated that 'distress in obtaining daily necessities' and 'concern about harming others' were the most important issues in people's responses to COVID-19. These nodes were connected by a negative edge, reflecting individual- and community-level issues, respectively. The overall level of perceived stress was linked to the network by the connection node 'anger toward others or society', which was associated with economic problems in men, but with distress from changes in daily activities in women. The results suggest that two contrasting feelings-personal insecurity regarding basic needs and a collectivistic orientation-play roles in the response to unusual experiences and distress due to COVID-19. This study also showed that public anger could arise from the psychological stress under the conditions imposed by COVID-19.","Ryu, Seunghyong; Park, In-Hoo; Kim, Mina; Lee, Yu-Ri; Lee, Jonghun; Kim, Honey; Jhon, Min; Kim, Ju-Wan; Lee, Ju-Yeon; Kim, Jae-Min; Kim, Sung-Wan",PLoS One,,150

COVID-19 disease severity is worse in older obese patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease. Cell binding and entry of betacoronaviruses is via their surface spike glycoprotein; SARS-CoV binds to the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and recent modeling of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein predicts that it can interact with human DPP4 in addition to ACE2. DPP4 is a ubiquitous membrane-bound aminopeptidase that circulates in plasma; it is multifunctional with roles in nutrition, metabolism, and immune and endocrine systems. DPP4 activity differentially regulates glucose homeostasis and inflammation via its enzymatic activity and nonenzymatic immunomodulatory effects. The importance of DPP4 for the medical community has been highlighted by the approval of DPP4 inhibitors, or gliptins, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review discusses the dysregulation of DPP4 in COVID-19 comorbid conditions; DPP4 activity is higher in older individuals and increased plasma DPP4 is a predictor of the onset of metabolic syndrome. DPP4 upregulation may be a determinant of COVID-19 disease severity, which creates interest regarding the use of gliptins in management of COVID-19. Also, knowledge of the chemistry and biology of DPP4 could be utilized to develop novel therapies to block viral entry of some betacoronaviruses, potentially including SARS-CoV-2.","Bassendine, Margaret F; Bridge, Simon H; McCaughan, Geoffrey W; Gorrell, Mark D",J Diabetes,,150

As a necessity, there is a need to track users who came in contact with users having travel history, asymptomatic and not yet symptomatic, but they can be in the future. To solve this problem, the present work proposes a solution for contact tracing based on assisted GPS and cloud computing technologies. An application is developed to collect each user's assisted GPS coordinates once all the users install this application. This application periodically sends assisted GPS data to the cloud. To determine which devices are within the permissible limit of 5m, we perform clustering over assisted GPS coordinates and track the clusters for about t mins to allow the measure of spread. We assume that it takes around 3 or 5 mins to get the virus from an infected object. For clustering, the proposed M way like tree data structure stores the assisted GPS coordinates in degree, minute, and second format. Thus, every user is mapped to a leaf node of the tree. We split the""seconds""part of the assisted GPS location into m equal parts, which amount to d meter in latitude(longitude). Hence, two users who are within d meter range will map to the same leaf node. Thus, by mapping assisted GPS locations every t mins, we can find out how many users came in contact with a particular user for at least t mins. Our work's salient feature is that it runs in linear time O(n) for n users in the static case, i.e., when users are not moving. We also propose a variant of our solution to handle the dynamic case, that is, when users are moving. Besides, the proposed solution offers potential hotspot detection and safe-route recommendation as an additional feature, and proof of concept is presented through experiments on simulated data of 10M users.","Maurya, Chandresh Kumar; Jain, Seemandhar; Thakre, Vishal",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.15030v1.pdf,150

Here we report the first data on the humoral response to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a case series of 4 pwMS treated with ocrelizumab (OCR) as compared to a group of healthy subjects (HS). METHODS: We collected serum samples at 0, 14, 21 days after the first dose and 7 days after the second dose of BNT162b2-mRNA-Covid-19 vaccine from 55 health-care workers and 4 relapsing pwMS on OCR, with no history of Covid-19 infection. Sera were tested using the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS-IgG assay (DiaSorin-S.p.A.) for the detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The anti-spike IgGtiters were expressed in Binding Antibody Units (BAU), an international standard unit. RESULTS: At baseline all subjects were negative for anti-spike IgG. Seven days after the second dose of vaccine all HS mounted a significant humoral response (geometric mean 2010.4 BAU/mL C.I. 95% 1512.7-2672) while the 4 pwMS showed a lower response (range <4.81-175 BAU/mL). DISCUSSION: Humoral response to BNT162b2-mRNA-vaccine in pwMS treated with OCR was clearly blunted. Further data are urgently needed to confirm and expand these preliminary results and to develop strategies to optimize the response to SARSCoV-2 vaccines in pwMS on OCR.","Gallo, Antonio; Capuano, Rocco; Donnarumma, Giovanna; Bisecco, Alvino; Grimaldi, Elena; Conte, Miriana; d039,; Ambrosio, Alessandro; Coppola, Nicola; Galdiero, Massimiliano; Tedeschi, Gioacchino",Neurol. sci,,150

Procedures involving the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) are routinely non-aerosolizing but have the potential for rapid patient deterioration, creating the need for aerosolizing generating procedures. Multiple societal and governmental guidelines on the use of PPE during medical procedures are available on Internet websites;however, there is limited literature available in peer-reviewed formats in this context. This study aims to provide an overview of current PPE donning and doffing protocols specific to the catheterization laboratory. Methods: A series of internet searches regarding donning and doffing of PPE in the CCL including published articles and internet protocols were compiled and compared using Pubmed.gov, Google.com, www.twitter.com, and www.youtube.com. Results: Most institutions used N95 masks, shoe covers, at least one head covering, face shield or goggles, two pairs of gloves, and inner and outer gowns. Doffing variation was greater than donning. Doffing has the potential to contaminate the healthcare worker (HCW), and therefore, this step of PPE management requires further study. Common steps in temporal priority included cleaning of gloved hands, removal of outer (or only) gown, removal of outer gloves, repeat gloved hand cleaning, removal of facial PPE last, and a final non-gloved hand cleaning. Conclusions: This analysis provides a summary of commonly used practices that may be considered when designing CCL-specific PPE protocols. Analysis of consistent steps from the literature led the authors to formulate a suggested protocol for CCL HCWs when performing procedures on patients with confirmed or suspected/unknown COVID-19.","Haloot, J.; Sheikh, O.; Dollar, F.; Javeri, H.; Fichardt, H.

The study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of HCWs and the role of training in KAP of HCWs. Materials and Methods: The study population consists of all HCWs undergoing training for disinfection. A structured training module for paramedicals, i.e., module for paramedics in disinfection (MoPDis), was designed. The knowledge, attitude, and practice were assessed before and after the training. Results: A total of 183 male HCWs participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 31.33 ± 6.8 years and ranges from 21 to 49 years. The mean years of experience were 11.5 ± 7.1 years. The mean pretraining and posttraining scores were 8.1 ± 2.4 and 10 ± 1.9, respectively. The score increases from 53% pretraining score to 66.6% posttraining score. Age, experience, and specialty did not have any association with the gain in knowledge. Conclusions: The training program had significantly increased the KAP levels of the HCWs and hence may improve disinfection practices in hospitals, thus preventing the spread of infection. © 2021 Medical Journal of Dr. D.Y.

271436,Switching Diseased Cells from Cytosolic Aerobic Glycolysis to Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation: A Metabolic Rhythm Regulated by Melatonin?,2020,"As it has been shown that lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have in vitro activity against coronaviruses, they were used to treat COVID-19 during the first wave of the epidemic in Lombardy, Italy. To compare the rate of clinical improvement between those who started LPV/ritonavir (LPV/r)+HCQ within 5 days of symptom onset (early treatment, ET) and those who started later (delayed treatment, DT). This was a retrospective intent-to-treat analysis of the hospitalized patients who started LPV/r + HCQ between 21 February and 20 March 2020. The association between the timing of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality was assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic models. The study involved 172 patients: 43 (25%) in the ET and 129 (75%) in the DT group. The rate of clinical improvement increased over time to 73.3% on day 30, without any significant difference between the two groups (Gray's test P = .213). After adjusting for potentially relevant clinical variables, there was no significant association between the timing of the start of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] ET vs DT = 1.45, 95% confidence interval 0.50-4.19). Eight percent of the patients discontinued the treatment becausebecause of severe gastrointestinal disorders attributable to LPV/r. The timing of the start of LPV/r + HCQ treatment does not seem to affect the clinical course of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Together with the severe adverse events attributable to LPV/r, this raises concerns about the benefit of using this combination to treat COVID-19.","Giacomelli, Andrea; Pagani, Gabriele; Ridolfo, Anna L; Oreni, Letizia; Conti, Federico; Pezzati, Laura; Bradanini, Lucia; Casalini, Giacomo; Bassoli, Cinzia; Morena, Valentina; Passerini, Simone; Rizzardini, Giuliano; Cogliati, Chiara; Ceriani, Elisa; Colombo, Riccardo; Rusconi, Stefano; Gervasoni, Cristina; Cattaneo, Dario; Antinori, Spinello; Galli, Massimo",J Med Virol,,150

These mutations enhanced the electrostatic interactions. Recently, a new strain is reported in the UK that includes a mutation (N501Y) in the RBD, that is possibly increasing the infection rate. Here, using Molecular Dynamics simulations (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, we show that the N501 mutation enhanced the electrostatic interactions due to the formation of a strong hydrogen bond between SARS-CoV-2-T500 and ACE2-D355 near the mutation site. In addition, we observed that the electrostatic interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 in the wild type and the mutant are dominated by salt-bridges formed between SARS-CoV-2-K417 and ACE2-D30, SARS-CoV-2-K458, ACE2-E23, and SARS-CoV-2-R403 and ACE2-E37.

277367,Extended lifetime of respiratory droplets in a turbulent vapour puff and its implications on airborne disease transmission,2020-08-04,"Several reports have been released on how COVID-19 infection could be transmitted through dental services. This has caused fear in the community to seek treatment at a dentist. The increase in public fear is a change in emotions due to the overwhelming amount of news or reports about the spread of the COVID-19 infection through print, social, and electronic media around the world. A cross-sectional study was conducted using online survey from 10 June to 20 October 2020. This well-constructed questionnaire was designated using the free access Google form application and the link to the online survey was sent to participants through WhatsApp. A total of 1040 participants from 10 provinces in Indonesia participated in this study. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 24. The correlation between fear and oral health knowledge related to dental treatment were tested using the Chi-square and Spearman correlation test. Of the 1040 participants, 87.02% and 12.98% individuals experienced mild and moderate fear, respectively. A good level of oral health knowledge was found in 53.7% and the average level was 46.3% of participants. The bivariate correlation showed that less fear level was correlated with good oral health knowledge (r=−0.126, p&lt;0.05). The greatest fear comes from the possibility of transmission of the COVID-19 infection from dentists and seeing dentist with one of COVID-19 infection symptoms. The changing the habit of washing hands before undergoing dental treatment shows a fear of contracting a COVID-19 infection. People with a good level of knowledge have less fear than average level. © 2021. All rights reserved.","Sari, L. M.; Rahmayani, L.; Andriany, P.; Sundari, I.; Sari, D.

We investigate the privacy of socially contagious attributes on a network of individuals, where each individual possessing that attribute may influence a number of others into adopting it. We show that for contagions following the Independent Cascade model there exists a giant connected component of infected nodes, containing a constant fraction of all the nodes who all receive the contagion from the same set of sources. We further show that it is extremely hard to hide the existence of this giant connected component if we want to obtain an estimate of the activated users at an acceptable level. Moreover, an adversary possessing this knowledge can predict the real status (""active""or""inactive"") with decent probability for many of the individuals regardless of the privacy (perturbation) mechanism used. As a case study, we show that the Wasserstein mechanism, a state-of-the-art privacy mechanism designed specifically for correlated data, introduces a noise with magnitude of order $\Omega(n)$ in the count estimation in our setting. We provide theoretical guarantees for two classes of random networks: Erdos Renyi graphs and Chung-Lu power-law graphs under the Independent Cascade model. Experiments demonstrate that a giant connected component of infected nodes can and does appear in real-world networks and that a simple inference attack can reveal the status of a good fraction of nodes.","Rezaei, Aria; Gao, Jie; Sarwate, Anand D.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11877v1.pdf,150

This pandemic causing virus has the most evidence of spread from human to human and can be easily segregated from respiratory secretions, faeces and fomites. There are currently no clear preventive drugs or antiviral agents approved for the novel 2019 coronavirus disease. There are still no proven options available for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and the prophylaxis of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2. It is observed that antibodies accumulate in the blood plasma of a person who has recovered from COVID-19. When this blood plasma is injected into the blood of another patient infected by COVID-19, these antibodies are intended to assist that individual in battling the infection. That is why this research provides us with a sketch of the utility of convalescent plasma therapy as a possible and successful treatment for COVID-19.","Tirthankar, Dalui Debalina Mukherjee Subhechha Adhikary",Uttar Pradesh Journal of Zoology,,150

Therefore, community-based screening is critical. We aimed to identify clinical signs and symptoms and epidemiological features that could help discriminate confirmed cases of COVID-19 from SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. We found that age (aOR:1.02, 95%CI:1.02-1.03, p < 0.001), symptoms onset between 3 and 14 days (aOR:1.35, 95%CI:1.09)1.68, p = 0.006), fever or history of fever (aOR:1.75, 95%CI:1.42-2.14, p < 0.001), cough (aOR:1.68, 95%CI:1.31-2.04), sore throat (aOR:0.65, 95%CI:0.49-0.85, p = 0.002), ageusia (aOR:2.24, 95%CI:1.42-3.54, p = 0.001), anosmia (aOR:6.04, 95%CI:4.19-8.69, p < 0.001), chest pain (aOR:0.63, 95%CI:0.47-0.85, p = 0.003), myalgia and/or arthralgia (aOR:1.64, 95%CI:1.31-2.04, p < 0.001), household cluster (aOR:1.49, 95%CI:1.17-1.91, p = 0.001) and evidence of confirmed cases in the neighbourhood (aOR:1.92, 95%CI:1.56-2.37, p < 0.001) could help discriminate COVID-19 patients from SARS-CoV-2 negative.

The communicability and increased mortality from the SARS-CoV-2 infection mandated the WHO to declare COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic. The virus outbreak has spread when there are no approved vaccines, treatments, or prophylactic therapies available. Researchers from all over the world have prioritised development of vaccines and antivirals. Several vaccine projects have seen successes in preclinical, phase I, and phase II clinical trials using recombinant DNA, mRNA, live attenuated virus, S-protein subunits, virus like particles, and viral vectors. Initial findings from antivirals such as remdesivir, favipiravir, danoprevir or lopinavir with ritonavir are presented. Immunomodulatory molecules such as sarilumab, tocilizumab, janus kinase inhibitors, and hyperimmune convalescent plasma have mixed outcomes from initial clinical findings; however, pending randomised controlled trials will assist national health institutions to make treatment recommendations for COVID-19. Where compassionate use of remdesivir has shown some benefits, therapies such as hydroxychloroquine have proven harmful due to their toxicities. This review discusses pharmacological interventions at play and evidence-based successes and limitations of non-pharmacological therapies such as social distancing, personal protective equipment, and ventilator support associated with the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Alvi, Mohammed M; Sivasankaran, Sowmya; Singh, Mahima",J Drug Target,,150

Based on the population mobility metrics derived from mobile phone geolocation data across 135 countries or territories during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, we built a metapopulation epidemiological model to measure the effect of travel and contact restrictions on containing COVID-19 outbreaks across regions. We found that if these interventions had not been deployed, the cumulative number of cases could have shown a 97-fold (interquartile range 79-116) increase, as of May 31, 2020. However, their effectiveness depended upon the timing, duration, and intensity of the interventions, with variations in case severity seen across populations, regions, and seasons. Additionally, before effective vaccines are widely available and herd immunity is achieved, our results emphasize that a certain degree of physical distancing at the relaxation of the intervention stage will likely be needed to avoid rapid resurgences and subsequent lockdowns.","Lai, Shengjie; Ruktanonchai, Nick W; Carioli, Alessandra; Ruktanonchai, Corrine W; Floyd, Jessica R; Prosper, Olivia; Zhang, Chi; Du, Xiangjun; Yang, Weizhong; Tatem, Andrew J",,,150

Diabetes technology such as insulin pumps and CGM systems are established in most industrialized countries today. However, digital care has not been sufficiently integrated into clinical workflows. Objectives: The Digital Diabetes Clinic (DDC) study sought to. 1) remotely support families with children with diabetes in their daily diabetes management, 2) engage all stakeholders through a participatory project design involving patients, caregivers, and care teams, 3) test and further develop an interoperable platform for data sharing, analysis and visualization, 4) investigate quality of care using this platform as part of remote care in a feasibility study, and. 5) analyze success factors and barriers for HCPs on their journey from conventional to digital care. Methods: The DDC project is a mixed-methods study comprising a qualitative analysis of stakeholder workshops with a prospective longitudinal open-label feasibility and efficacy trial. The web-based opensource platform “Tidepool” was used to collect and review device data. Clinical and patient-reported outcomes were assessed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing digital to standard care. Results: A total of 29 patients enrolled, and all successfully completed 6 months of video visits. In addition, 16 participants opted to perform at least one of their regular clinic visits remotely. After 3 months of video visits, Time-in-Range had significantly improved whilst Time-in- Hypoglycemia was decreased. Conclusions: We sought to deliver an interoperable, comprehensive and holistic solution to deliver remote care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings can serve as a blueprint for other areas in chronic care, and will allow a sustainable integration of digital tools into existing workflows during the pandemic and beyond.","Braune, K.; Boss, K.; Schmidt-Herzel, J.; Schulze, L.; Posern, B.; Raile, K.",Pediatric Diabetes,,150
308672,Commercial whey products promote intestinal barrier function with glycomacropeptide enhanced activity in downregulating bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced inflammation in vitro,2020,"Post COVID-19 vaccine development, nations are now getting ready to face another challenge: how to effectively distribute vaccines among the masses to quickly achieve herd immunity against the infection. According to some experts, herd immunity for COVID-19 can be achieved by inoculating 67% of the population. India may find it difficult to achieve this service level target, owing to several infrastructural deficiencies in its vaccine supply chain. Effect of these deficiencies is to cause frequent lead time disruptions. In this context, we develop a novel modelling approach to identify few nodes, which require additional inventory allocations (strategic inventory reserves) to ensure minimum service level (67%) under the possibility of lead time disruptions. Later, through an illustrative case study on distribution of Japanese Encephalitis vaccine, we identify conditions under which strategic inventory reserve policy cannot be practically implemented to meet service level targets. Nodes fulfilling these conditions are termed as critical nodes and must be overhauled structurally to make the implementation of strategic inventory policy practically viable again. Structural overhauling may entail installation of better cold storage facilities, purchasing more quality transport vans, improving reliability of transport network, and skills of cold storage manager by training. Ideally, conditions for identifying critical nodes for COVID-19 vaccine distribution must be derived separately by substituting COVID-19 specific parametric values in our model. In the absence of the required data for COVID-19 scenario, JE specific criteria can be used heuristically to identify critical nodes and structurally overhaul them later for efficiently achieving service level targets.","Sinha, Priyank; Kumar, Sameer; Chandra, Charu",European journal of operational research,,150

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively selected a cohort of 86 COVID-19 patients (with positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test results) from March to May 2020 at a tertiary hospital in the northeastern United States, who underwent chest CT and CXR within 48 hours. The ground-truth volumetric percentage of COVID-19-related AD (POv) was established by manual AD segmentation on CT. The resulting 3-dimensional masks were projected into 2-dimensional anterior-posterior DRR to compute area-based AD percentage (POa). A CNN was trained with DRR images generated from a larger-scale CT dataset of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, automatically segmenting lungs, AD, and quantifying POa on CXR. The CNN POa results were compared with POa quantified on CXR by 2 expert readers and to the POv ground truth, by computing correlations and mean absolute errors. RESULTS: Bootstrap mean absolute error and correlations between POa and POv were 11.98% (11.05%-12.47%) and 0.77 (0.70-0.82) for average of expert readers and 9.56% to 9.78% (8.83%-10.22%) and 0.78 to 0.81 (0.73-0.85) for the CNN, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our CNN trained with DRR using CT-derived airspace quantification achieved expert radiologist level of accuracy in the quantification of AD on CXR in patients with positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test results for COVID-19.","Mortani Barbosa, Eduardo J; Gefter, Warren B; Ghesu, Florin C; Liu, Siqi; Mailhe, Boris; Mansoor, Awais; Grbic, Sasa; Vogt, Sebastian",Invest. radiol,,150

Comparing the data before and after the introduction of restrictive measures (night curfew, partial closure of schools and businesses, smaart working), we observed a significant decrease of infections in workplaces, social gatherings, coffee shops, restaurants, and sports centers; contagion in schools decreased from 9.2% to 3.4%, in hospitals environments and nursing homes from 5% to 2%; domestic infections increased instead from 73.5% to 92.7%. These results suggest that containment measures have been effective in controlling virus circulation in the community but not at the household level and might inform future interventions, including the establishment of structures (Covid Hotels) for the isolation infected people. At the same time, they raise awareness on the risk of transmission among family members and during households social gatherings.","Signorelli, Carlo; Odone, Anna; Stirparo, Giuseppe; Cereda, Danilo; Gramegna, Maria; Trivelli, Marco; Rezza, Gianni",Acta Biomed,,150
311365,Clinical trial recovery from COVID-19 disruption,2020,"The current pandemic caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been described as a global health emergency. The outbreak of this virus has raised a number of questions: what exactly is SARS-CoV-2? How transmissible the novel coronavirus is? How severely affected are patients infected with SARS-CoV-2? What are the risk factors for COVID-19? What are the differences between this novel coronavirus and other coronaviruses? To answer these questions, a comparative study of three pathogenic coronaviruses that primarily invade the human respiratory system and may cause death, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This review describes the source of origin, transmission, and pathogenicity of these viruses. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 spreading entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The novel coronavirus spreads faster than its two predecessors - the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV - but has lower fatality rate. The global impact of this new pandemic is still uncertain, but it is a challenge to healthcare systems around the world.","Golke, Anna; Piekarska, Karolina; Dzieciatkowski, Tomasz",Postepy Biochem,,150

Here different symptoms of neurological and/or cardiological origin have been reported. With symptoms, which are very similar to the ones reported but are not caused by SARS-CoV-2, the occurrence of functionally active autoantibodies (fAABs) targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR-fAABs) has been discussed to be involved. We, therefore investigated, whether GPCR-fAABs are detectable in 31 patients suffering from different Long-COVID-19 symptoms after recovery from the acute phase of the disease. The spectrum of symptoms was mostly of neurological origin (29/31 patients), including post-COVID-19 fatigue, alopecia, attention deficit, tremor and others. Combined neurological and cardiovascular disorders were reported in 17 of the 31 patients. Two recovered COVID-19 patients were free of follow-up symptoms. All 31 former COVID-19 patients had between 2 and 7 different GPCR-fAABs that acted as receptor agonists. Some of those GPCR-fAABs activate their target receptors which cause a positive chronotropic effect in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the read-out in the test system for their detection (bioassay for GPCR-fAAB detection). Other GPCR-fAABs, in opposite, cause a negative chronotropic effect on those cells. The positive chronotropic GPCR-fAABs identified in the blood of Long-COVID patients targeted the ß2-adrenoceptor (ß2-fAAB), the &#945;1-adrenoceptor (&#945;1-fAAB), the angiotensin II AT1-receptor (AT1-fAAB), and the nociceptin-like opioid receptor (NOC-fAAB). The negative chronotropic GPCR-fAABs identified targeted the muscarinic M2-receptor (M2-fAAB), the MAS-receptor (MAS-fAAB), and the ETA-receptor (ETA-fAAB). It was analysed which of the extracellular receptor loops was targeted by the autoantibodies.","Wallukat, Gerd; Hohberger, Bettina; Wenzel, Katrin; Fürst, Julia; Schulze-Rothe, Sara; Wallukat, Anne; Hönicke, Anne-Sophie; Müller, Johannes",J Transl Autoimmun,,150

In this paper, similar genus (Dalbergia and Pterocarpus) and confused species (Gluta sp.) of sandalwood were quickly and efficiently identified. Rapid identification model based on 1H NMR and decision tree (DT) algorithm was firstly developed for the identification of sandalwood, and the accuracy was improved by introducing the AdaBoost algorithm. The accuracy of the final model was above 95%. And the feature components between different species of sandalwood were further explored using UHPLC-QTOFMS and NMR spectrometry. The results showed that 183 compounds were identified, among which 99 were known components, 84 were unknown components. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR signals of 505 samples were assigned, among them, 14 compounds were attributed, characteristic chemical shift intervals with great differences in the model were analysed. Furthermore, the fragmentation pattern of different compounds from sandalwood, in both positive and negative ion ESI modes, was summarized. The results showed a potential and rapid tool based on DT, NMR spectroscopy and UHPLC-QTOFMS, which had performed great potential for rapid identification and feature analysis of sandalwood.","Tan, Youzhen; Chen, Biying; Ren, Cui; Guo, Mingxin; Wang, Juanxia; Shi, Kexing; Wu, Xia; Feng, Yifan",J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,,150

However, the risk factors and a method to predict the prognosis of post-transplantation CNS IIDDs are not available. This retrospective study first reviewed data from 4532 patients who received haplo-HSCT during 2008-2019 in our center, and 184 patients (4.1%) with IIDDs after haplo-HSCT were identified. Grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (p < 0.001) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) (p = 0.009) were identified as risk factors for developing IIDDs after haplo-HSCT. We then divided the 184 IIDD patients into a derivation cohort and validation cohort due to transplantation time to develop and validate a model for predicting the prognosis of IIDDs. In the multivariate analysis of the derivation cohort, four candidate predictors were entered into the final prognostic model: cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, IgG synthesis (IgG-syn) and spinal cord lesions. The prognostic model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.864 (95% CI: 0.803-0.925) in the internal validation cohort and 0.871 (95% CI: 0.806-0.931) in the external validation cohort. The calibration plots showed a high agreement between the predicted and observed outcomes. Decision curve analysis indicated that IIDD patients could benefit from the clinical application of the prognostic model. The identification of IIDD patients after allo-HSCT who have a poor prognosis might allow timely treatment and improve patient survival and outcomes.","Deng, Rui-Xin; Wu, Ye-Jun; Xu, Lan-Ping; Liu, Kai-Yan; Huang, Xiao-Jun; Zhang, Xiao-Hui",Am. j. hematol,,150
317579,Numerical modeling of therapeutic lens drug delivery in the anterior human eye for the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma,2020,"BACKGROUND: We previously showed that the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) increases inflammatory cleaved caspase-1 activity in myocytes, and that caspase-1/11 is protective in sterile liver injury. However, the role of caspase-1/11 in the recovery of muscle from ischemia caused by peripheral arterial disease is unknown. We hypothesized that caspase-1/11 mediates recovery in muscle via effects on autophagy and this is modulated by CQ. METHODS: C57Bl/6 J (WT) and caspase-1/11 double-knockout (KO) mice underwent femoral artery ligation (a model of hind-limb ischemia) with or without CQ (50 mg/kg IP every 2nd day). CQ effects on autophagosome formation, microtubule associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3), and caspase-1 expression was measured using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging documented perfusion every 7 days. After 21 days, in situ physiologic testing in tibialis anterior muscle assessed peak force contraction, and myocyte size and fibrosis was also measured. Muscle satellite cell (MuSC) oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate was measured. Caspase-1 and glycolytic enzyme expression was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: CQ increased autophagosomes, LC3 consolidation, total caspase-1 expression and cleaved caspase-1 in muscle. Perfusion, fibrosis, myofiber regeneration, muscle contraction, MuSC fusion, OCR, ECAR and glycolytic enzyme expression was variably affected by CQ depending on presence of caspase-1/11. CQ decreased perfusion recovery, fibrosis and myofiber size in WT but not caspase-1/11KO mice. CQ diminished peak force in whole muscle, and myocyte fusion in MuSC and these effects were exacerbated in caspase-1/11KO mice. CQ reductions in maximal respiration and ATP production were reduced in caspase-1/11KO mice. Caspase-1/11KO MuSC had significant increases in protein kinase isoforms and aldolase with decreased ECAR. CONCLUSION: Caspase-1/11 signaling affects the response to ischemia in muscle and effects are variably modulated by CQ. This may be critically important for disease treated with CQ and its derivatives, including novel viral diseases (e.g. COVID-19) that are expected to affect patients with comorbidities like cardiovascular disease.","Sachdev, Ulka; Ferrari, Ricardo; Cui, Xiangdong; Pius, Abish; Sahu, Amrita; Reynolds, Michael; Liao, Hong; Sun, Ping; Shinde, Sunita; Ambrosio, Fabrisia; Shiva, Sruti; Loughran, Patricia; Scott, Melanie",Mol Med,,150

319990,Co3O4@TiO2@Y2O3 nanocomposites for a highly sensitive CO gas sensor and quantitative analysis,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 helicase Nsp13 is a promising target for developing anti-COVID drugs. In the present study, we have identified potential natural product inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 targeting the ATP-binding site using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD simulation of the prepared crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 was performed to generate an ensemble of structures of helicase Nsp13 capturing the conformational diversity of the ATP-binding site. A natural product library of more than 14,000 phytochemicals from Indian medicinal plants was used to perform virtual screening against the ensemble of Nsp13 structures. Subsequently, a two-stage filter, first based on protein-ligand docking binding energy value and second based on protein residues in the ligand-binding site and non-covalent interactions between the protein residues and the ligand in the best-docked pose, was used to identify 368 phytochemicals as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 helicase Nsp13. MD simulations of the top inhibitors complexed with protein were performed to confirm stable binding, and to compute MM-PBSA based binding energy. From among the 368 potential phytochemical inhibitors, the top identified potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 helicase Nsp13 namely, Picrasidine M, (+)-Epiexcelsin, Isorhoeadine, Euphorbetin and Picrasidine N, can be taken up initially for experimental studies.","Vivek-Ananth, R P; Krishnaswamy, Sankaran; Samal, Areejit",Mol. divers,,150

Here the safety and immunogenicity induced by a DNA vaccine (INO-4800) targeting the full length spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 are described. Methods: INO-4800 was evaluated in two groups of 20 participants, receiving either 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg of vaccine intradermally followed by CELLECTRA® EP at 0 and 4 weeks. Thirty-nine subjects completed both doses; one subject in the 2.0 mg group discontinued trial participation prior to receiving the second dose. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04336410. Findings: The median age was 34.5, 55% (22/40) were men and 82.5% (33/40) white. Through week 8, only 6 related Grade 1 adverse events in 5 subjects were observed. None of these increased in frequency with the second administration. No serious adverse events were reported. All 38 subjects evaluable for immunogenicity had cellular and/or humoral immune responses following the second dose of INO-4800. By week 6, 95% (36/38) of the participants seroconverted based on their responses by generating binding (ELISA) and/or neutralizing antibodies (PRNT IC50), with responder geometric mean binding antibody titers of 655.5 [95% CI (255.6, 1681.0)] and 994.2 [95% CI (395.3, 2500.3)] in the 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg groups, respectively. For neutralizing antibody, 78% (14/18) and 84% (16/19) generated a response with corresponding geometric mean titers of 102.3 [95% CI (37.4, 280.3)] and 63.5 [95% CI (39.6, 101.8)], in the respective groups. By week 8, 74% (14/19) and 100% (19/19) of subjects generated T cell responses by IFN-É£ ELISpot assay with the median SFU per 106 PBMC of 46 [95% CI (21.1, 142.2)] and 71 [95% CI (32.2, 194.4)] in the 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg groups, respectively. Flow cytometry demonstrated a T cell response, dominated by CD8+ T cells co-producing IFN-É£ and TNF-&#945;, without increase in IL-4. Interpretation: INO-4800 demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability and was immunogenic in 100% (38/38) of the vaccinated subjects by eliciting either or both humoral or cellular immune responses.

322239,What is optimal in optimal inference?,2019,"Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with stroke. The role of sex on stroke outcome has not been investigated. We describe the characteristics of a diverse cohort of acute stroke patients with COVID-19 disease, and investigate the role of sex on outcome. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients with acute stroke and SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted between March 15 to May 15, 2020 to one of the six participating comprehensive stroke centers from Chicago metropolitan area. Baseline characteristics, stroke subtype, workup, treatment and outcome are presented as total number and percentage. Outcome at discharge was determined by the modified Rankin Scale Score (mRS). Variables and outcomes were compared for males and females using univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: The study included 83 patients. Median age was 64 years and the majority were Blacks (47%) followed by Hispanics (28%) and whites (16%). Approximately 89% had at least one preexisting vascular risk factor (VRF). The most common complications were respiratory failure (59%) and septic shock (34%). Higher proportions of male experienced severe SARS-CoV-2 symptoms requiring ICU hospitalization (73% vs. 49%;p=0.04). When divided by stroke subtype, there were 77% ischemic, 19% intracerebral hemorrhage and 3% subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most common ischemic stroke etiologies were cryptogenic (39%) and cardioembolic (27%).Compared to female, males had higher mortality (38% vs. 13%;p=0.02) and were less likely to bedischarged home (12% vs. 33%;p=0.04). After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, and number ofVRFs, mRS was higher in males than in females (OR=1.47, 95% CI=1.03-2.09) Conclusion: In this cohort of SARS-CoV-2 stroke patients, most had clinical evidence ofcoronavirus infection on admission and preexisting VRFs. Severe in-hospital complications andworse outcomes after ischemic strokes were higher in males, than females.","Trifan, G.; Goldenberg, F. D.; Caprio, F. Z.; Biller, J.; Schneck, M.

323375,First-generation physician-scientists are under-represented and need better support,2021,"It is of paramount importance to evaluate the prevalence of both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their differing antibody response profiles. Here, we performed a pilot study of four serological assays to assess the amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples obtained from 491 healthy individuals before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 51 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, 209 suspected cases of COVID-19 with mild symptoms, and 200 healthy blood donors. We used two ELISA assays that recognized the full-length nucleoprotein (N) or trimeric spike (S) protein ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we developed the S-Flow assay that recognized the S protein expressed at the cell surface using flow cytometry, and the luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay that recognized diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens including the S1 domain and the carboxyl-terminal domain of N by immunoprecipitation. We obtained similar results with the four serological assays. Differences in sensitivity were attributed to the technique and the antigen used. High anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were associated with neutralization activity, which was assessed using infectious SARS-CoV-2 or lentiviral-S pseudotype virus. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, seroconversion and virus neutralization occurred between 5 and 14 days after symptom onset, confirming previous studies. Seropositivity was detected in 32% of mildly symptomatic individuals within 15 days of symptom onset and in 3% of healthy blood donors. The four antibody assays that we used enabled a broad evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and antibody profiling in different subpopulations within one region.","Grzelak, Ludivine; Temmam, Sarah; Planchais, Cyril; Demeret, Caroline; Tondeur, Laura; Huon, Christèle; Guivel-Benhassine, Florence; Staropoli, Isabelle; Chazal, Maxime; Dufloo, Jeremy; Planas, Delphine; Buchrieser, Julian; Rajah, Maaran Michael; Robinot, Remy; Porrot, Françoise; Albert, Mélanie; Chen, Kuang-Yu; Crescenzo-Chaigne, Bernadette; Donati, Flora; Anna, François; Souque, Philippe; Gransagne, Marion; Bellalou, Jacques; Nowakowski, Mireille; Backovic, Marija; Bouadma, Lila; Le Fevre, Lucie; Le Hingrat, Quentin; Descamps, Diane; Pourbaix, Annabelle; Laouénan, Cédric; Ghosn, Jade; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Besombes, Camille; Jolly, Nathalie; Pellerin-Fernandes, Sandrine; Cheny, Olivia; Ungeheuer, Marie-Noëlle; Mellon, Guillaume; Morel, Pascal; Rolland, Simon; Rey, Felix A; Behillil, Sylvie; Enouf, Vincent; Lemaitre, Audrey; Créach, Marie-Aude; Petres, Stephane; Escriou, Nicolas; Charneau, Pierre; Fontanet, Arnaud",Sci. transl. med,,150

Post-mortem examination can provide important mechanistic insights. Methods: We present a COVID-19 autopsy series including findings in lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, and bone, from a New York academic medical center. Findings: In seven patients (four female), regardless of anticoagulation status, all autopsies demonstrated platelet-rich thrombi in the pulmonary, hepatic, renal, and cardiac microvasculature. Megakaryocytes were seen in higher than usual numbers in the lungs and heart. Two cases had thrombi in the large pulmonary arteries, where casts conformed to the anatomic location. Thrombi in the IVC were not found, but the deep leg veins were not dissected. Two cases had cardiac venous thrombosis with one case exhibiting septal myocardial infarction associated with intramyocardial venous thrombosis, without atherosclerosis. One case had focal acute lymphocyte-predominant inflammation in the myocardium with no virions found in cardiomyocytes. Otherwise, cardiac histopathological changes were limited to minimal epicardial inflammation (nâ¯=â¯1), early ischemic injury (nâ¯=â¯3), and mural fibrin thrombi (nâ¯=â¯2). Platelet-rich peri­tubular fibrin microthrombi were a prominent renal feature. Acute tubular necrosis, and red blood cell and granular casts were seen in multiple cases. Significant glomerular pathology was notably absent. Numerous platelet-fibrin microthrombi were identified in hepatic sinusoids. All lungs exhibited diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with a spectrum of exudative and proliferative phases including hyaline membranes, and pneumocyte hyperplasia, with viral inclusions in epithelial cells and macrophages. Three cases had superimposed acute bronchopneumonia, focally necrotizing. Interpretation: In this series of seven COVID-19 autopsies, thrombosis was a prominent feature in multiple organs, in some cases despite full anticoagulation and regardless of timing of the disease course, suggesting that thrombosis plays a role very early in the disease process. The finding of megakaryocytes and platelet-rich thrombi in the lungs, heart and kidneys suggests a role in thrombosis.

It first summarizes original cytological observations before comparing concepts of nuclear compartments emerging from microscopy versus genomic approaches and then introducing new multiplexed imaging approaches that promise in the future to meld both approaches. I discuss how previous models of radial distribution of chromosomes or the binary division of the genome into A and B compartments are now being refined by the recognition of more complex nuclear compartmentalization. The poorly understood question of how these nuclear compartments are established and maintained is then discussed, including through the modern perspective of phase separation, before moving on to address possible functions of nuclear compartments, using the possible role of nuclear speckles in modulating gene expression as an example.

The impacts are multiple especially for patients cared for cancer. The Covid-19 epidemic has several impacts on the management of lung cancer patients. The aim of this work was to summarize the available epidemiological data on patients diagnosed with lung cancer infected with Covid-19 and describe the different strategies to improve the management of these patients by summarizing the recommendations in this area. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Teravolt cohort is an observational multicenter registry, including patients with non-small cell cancer, small cell cancer or mesothelioma but also epithelial tumors and a diagnosis of Covid-19. The Theravolt registry indicates an unexpectedly high mortality rate in patients with thoracic malignancies with COVID-19. RESULTS: Between March 26 and April 12, 2020, 200 patients treated in 8 countries were included. They had a performance status (PS) of 0-1 in 72% of cases, were smokers or ex-smokers in 81% of cases, had non-small cell cancer (76% of cases), were under treatment in 74% of cases, and the majority were first-line cases (57%). The hospitalization rate was 76% and the mortality rate 33%; only 10% of patients with criteria for intensive care hospitalization were admitted to the intensive care. CONCLUSION: Data presented in this registry suggest a high mortality in patients with thoracic cancer and Covid-19. Therofere, the importance to create a safe healthcare system during Covid-19 pandemic is underlined along with the need for essential effective clinical service delivery to patients with lung cancer.","Haineala, Bogdan; Zgura, Anca; Badiu, Dumitru Cristinel; Iliescu, Laura; Anghel, Rodica Maricela; Bacinschi, Xenia Elena",In Vivo,,150

While multiple PICUs have treated adult patients with COVID-19, there is an absence of data on the characteristics of patients transferred to pediatric care and their resulting outcomes in comparison to standard adult intensive care unit (AICU) provision. Data were collected for all adult COVID-19 intensive care admissions between March and May 2020, in three ICUs within a single center: PICU, AICU, and theater recovery ICU (RICU). Patient characteristics, severity of illness, and outcomes were described according to the ICU where most of their bed-days occurred. Outcomes included duration of organ support and ICU admission, and mortality at 30 days. Mortality was compared between patients in PICU and the other adult ICUs, using a logistic regression model, adjusting for known confounding variables. Eighty-eight patients were included: 15 (17.0%) in PICU, 57 (64.7%) in AICU, and 16 (18.1%) in RICU. Patients' characteristics and illness severity on admission were comparable across locations, with similar organ support provided. Ten (66.7%) patients survived to hospital discharge from PICU, compared with 27 (47.4%) and nine (56.3%) patients from AICU and RICU, respectively, with no significant difference in 30-day mortality (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.12-1.85;p = 0.276). Our analysis illustrates the feasibility of evaluating outcomes of patients who have been cared for in additional, emergency ICU beds, whilst demonstrating comparable outcomes for adults cared for in pediatric and adult units.","Fitchett, E.

Those symptoms can be the first manifestation of COVID-19, but whether they reflect a better or worse prognosis, is controversial. The potential relation of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor in the digestive tract as an entry route for the virus is discussed. CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal symptoms may be common in COVID-19, in some cases appearing as the first manifestation, even before fever and respiratory symptoms. Therefore, clinicians and gastroenterologists must be aware of those atypical cases during the current pandemic, as well as of the fecal-oral route and corresponding preventive measures.","Schmulson, M; Dávalos, M F; Berumen, J",Rev Gastroenterol Mex,,150

Although there is an association between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19, the majority of patients who need cardiovascular care for the management of ischemic heart disease may not be infected with this novel coronavirus. The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for a systematic approach for the care of patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a recognition of two major challenges in providing recommendations for AMI care in the COVID-19 era. Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are complex with patients presenting with AMI, myocarditis simulating an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) presentation, stress cardiomyopathy, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary spasm, or nonspecific myocardial injury, and the prevalence of COVID-19 disease in the US population remains unknown with risk of asymptomatic spread. This document addresses the care of these patients focusing on (a) varied clinical presentations; (b) appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers; (c) the roles of the emergency department, emergency medical system, and the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL); and (4) regional STEMI systems of care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains the standard of care for STEMI patients at PCI-capable hospitals when it can be provided in a timely manner, with an expert team outfitted with PPE in a dedicated CCL room. A fibrinolysis-based strategy may be entertained at non-PCI-capable referral hospitals or in specific situations where primary PCI cannot be executed or is not deemed the best option.","Mahmud, Ehtisham; Dauerman, Harold L; Welt, Frederick G P; Messenger, John C; Rao, Sunil V; Grines, Cindy; Mattu, Amal; Kirtane, Ajay J; Jauhar, Rajiv; Meraj, Perwaiz; Rokos, Ivan C; Rumsfeld, John S; Henry, Timothy D",Catheter Cardiovasc Interv,,150

Now that the vaccine is available to priority populations, it is critical to convince those that are hesitant to take the vaccine. Public health communication about the vaccine as well as misinformation on the vaccine occurs through a variety of different information channels. Some channels of information are more commonly found to spread misinformation. Given the expansive information environment, we sought to characterize the use of different media channels for COVID-19 vaccine information and determine the relationship between information channel and vaccine acceptance. We used quota sampling of vaccine priority groups [N = 2,650] between December 13 and 23, 2020 and conducted bivariate chi-squared tests and multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses to determine the relative impact of channels of information on vaccine acceptance. We found traditional channels of information, especially National TV, National newspapers, and local newspapers increased the likelihood of vaccine acceptance. Individuals who received information from traditional media compared to social media or both traditional and social media were most likely to accept the vaccine. The implications of this study suggest social media channels have a role to play in educating the hesitant to accept the vaccine, while traditional media channels should continue to promote data-driven and informed vaccine content to their viewers.","Piltch-Loeb, Rachael; Savoia, Elena; Goldberg, Beth; Hughes, Brian; Verhey, Tanner; Kayyem, Juliette; Miller-Idriss, Cynthia; Testa, Marcia",PLoS One,,150
341893,Coronaviruses – new emerging pathogens,2020,"PURPOSE: To evaluate trends in emergency room (ER) urological conditions during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analyses of renal colic, hematuria, and urinary retention in ER's admissions of a tertiary hospital during the lockdown period (March 19 to May 4, 2020) in Israel. Patient's demographics and clinical characteristics were compared to those in corresponding periods during 2017-2019, with estimated changes in ER arrival and waiting times, utilization of imaging tests, numbers of hospitalizations, and urgent procedure rates. RESULTS: The number of ER visits for renal colic, hematuria, and urinary retention decreased by 37%, from an average of 451 (2017-2019) to 261 patients (2020). Clinical severity was similar between groups, with no major differences in patient's age, vital signs, or laboratory results. The proportion of ER visits during night hours increased significantly during lockdown (44.8% vs. 34.2%, p=0.002). There was a decrease in renal colic admission rate from 19.8% to 8.4% (p=0.001) without differences in urgent procedures rates, while the 30-day revisit rate decreased from 15.8% to 10.3% during lockdown (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: General lockdown was accompanied by a significant decrease in common urological presentations to the ER. This change occurred across the clinical severity spectrum of renal colic, hematuria, and urinary retention. In the short term, it appears that patients who sought treatment did not suffer from complications that could be attributed to late arrival or delay in treatment. The long-term implications of abstinence from seeking emergent care are not known and require further investigation.","Frumer, Michael; Aharony, Shachar M; Shoshany, Ohad; Kedar, Daniel; Baniel, Jack; Golan, Shay",Int Braz J Urol,,150

345062,New filter coating helps fight viruses,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Hospital admissions from COVID-19 initially increased rapidly within the UK. National Health Service (NHS) field hospitals are part of a capacity building response built at great scale and speed to respond to the anticipated increased demand the NHS faces during this time. NHS Nightingale Hospital Birmingham (NHB) is modelled to treat mild to moderate (non-critical care) COVID-19 disease, to provide step-down capacity for patients in recovery, or for palliating patients in the dying phase of their disease in the Midlands. Opportunities and challenges presented for optimal medicines management (MM) during the development of the NHB are investigated, and a framework developed to support future NHS field hospitals of this model. METHODS: A team, comprised of an associate medical director, trust chief pharmacist and senior pharmacists iteratively developed a framework to convert the large non-hospital setting into a functioning NHS field hospital with standardised MM processes adjusted appropriately to cope with operational constraints in the pandemic situation. NHB has, because of its repurposing, both challenges and advantages affecting MM that influence development of the framework. Throughout implementation, a 7-week period between announcement and opening, there was continuous evaluation, external stakeholder validation and peer review. RESULTS: The PESTLE model, a mechanism of analysis to identify elements of a project environment (Political, Environmental, Social, Technological, Legal and Economic), was applied to identify influencing factors and support detailed project planning. Compliance with medicines legislation was at the forefront of all MM process development for the NHB field hospital. Internal factors were identified by the core MM team, resulting in a workforce, education & training and clinical pharmacy MM plan. DISCUSSION: MM processes are extensive and integral to NHS field hospitals. The presented framework of influencing factors may support future NHS field hospital development. It is pertinent to have a broad team working approach to any large-scale project such as outlined here, and suggest the identified factors be used as a core framework for development of any future MM processes in NHS field hospitals.","de Val, Jennifer; Sohal, Gurjit; Sarwar, Asif; Ahmed, Haseeb; Singh, Inderjit; Coleman, Jamie J",,,150

Virus-specific immunity controls infection, transmission, and disease severity. With respect to disease severity, a spectrum of clinical outcomes can occur on the basis of the age, genetics, comorbidities, and immune responses in an infected person. Dysfunctions in innate and adaptive immunity commonly follow viral infection. These are heralded by altered mononuclear phagocyte differentiation, activation, intracellular killing and memory, effector, and regulatory T cell responses. All of such affect viral clearance and the progression of end-organ disease. Failures to produce effective controlled antiviral immunity leads to life-threatening end-organ disease that is typified by the acute respiratory distress syndrome. The most effective means to contain SARS-CoV-2 infection is by vaccination. While an arsenal of immunomodulators were developed for control of viral infection and subsequent COVID-19 disease, further research is required to enable therapeutic implementation.","Patel, Milankumar; Shahjin, Farah; Cohen, Jacob D; Hasan, Mahmudul; Machhi, Jatin; Chugh, Heerak; Singh, Snigdha; Das, Srijanee; Kulkarni, Tanmay A; Herskovitz, Jonathan; Meigs, Douglas D; Chandra, Ramesh; Hettie, Kenneth S; Mosley, R Lee; Kevadiya, Bhavesh D; Gendelman, Howard E",FEMS microbiol. rev,,150

Recently, the role of frailty status in adverse clinical outcomes for COVID-19-infected patients has received increasing attention with controversial results. Hence, we will conduct a comprehensive dose-response meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the association between frailty status and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The researchers will systematically search PubMed, EMBase, Cochrane Library, ISI Knowledge via Web of Science and MedRxiv or BioRxiv databases (from inception until December 2020) to identify all retrospective and prospective cohort studies. All-cause mortality during hospitalisation will be set as the primary outcome. Univariable or multivariable meta-regression and subgroup analyses will be conducted for the comparison between frail versus non-frail categories. Sensitivity analyses will be used to assess the robustness of our results by removing each included study one at a time to obtain and evaluate the remaining overall estimates of all-cause mortality. To conduct a dose-response meta-analysis for the potential linear or restricted cubic spline regression relationship between frailty status and all-cause mortality, studies with three or more categories will be included.

Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool specimens. However, the relationship between the gut microbiome and disease remains to be established. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 30 COVID-19 patients, 24 influenza A (H1N1) patients, and 30 matched healthy controls (HC) to identify differences in the gut microbiota by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene V3-V4 region sequencing. RESULTS: Compared with HC, COVID-19 patients had significantly reduced bacterial diversity, a significantly higher relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus, Rothia, Veillonella and Actinomyces, and a lower relative abundance of beneficial symbionts. Five biomarkers showed high accuracy for distinguishing COVID-19 patients from HC with an area under the curve (AUC) up to 0.89. Patients with H1N1 displayed lower diversity and different overall microbial composition compared with COVID-19 patients. Seven biomarkers were selected to distinguish the two cohorts with an AUC of 0.94. CONCLUSION: The gut microbial signature of patients with COVID-19 was different from that of H1N1 patients and HC. Our study suggests the potential value of the gut microbiota as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for COVID-19, but further validation is needed.","Gu, Silan; Chen, Yanfei; Wu, Zhengjie; Chen, Yunbo; Gao, Hainv; Lv, Longxian; Guo, Feifei; Zhang, Xuewu; Luo, Rui; Huang, Chenjie; Lu, Haifeng; Zheng, Beiwen; Zhang, Jiaying; Yan, Ren; Zhang, Hua; Jiang, Huiyong; Xu, Qiaomai; Guo, Jing; Gong, Yiwen; Tang, Lingling; Li, Lanjuan",Clin. infect. dis,,150

356701,"The 2020 Wild, Wild West of Diagnostics",2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic Betacoronavirus causing the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. More than twelve million COVID-19 cases and 500 thousand fatalities have been reported in 216 countries. Although SARS-CoV-2 originated in China, comparatively fewer people have been affected in other Asian countries than in Europe and the USA. This study examined the hypothesis that lower temperature may increase the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by comparing attack rate and case fatality rate (until 21 March 2020) to mean temperature in January–February 2020. The attack rate was highest in Luxembourg followed by Italy and Switzerland. There was a significant (p = 0.02) correlation between decreased attack rate and increased environmental temperature. The case fatality rate was highest in Italy followed by Iran and Spain. There was no significant correlation between the case fatality rate and temperature. This study indicates that lower temperature may increase SARS-CoV-2 transmission (measured as an increased attack rate), but there is no evidence that temperature affects the severity of the disease (measured as case fatality rate). However, there are clearly other factors that affect the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and many of these may be sensitive to interventions, e.g. through increased public awareness and public health response.","Hassan, Mohammad M.; El Zowalaty, Mohamed E.; Khan, Shahneaz A.; Islam, Ariful; Nayem, Md.

356962,Virtual meeting in pathology: Time to adapt to the new-nor,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); a worldwide pandemic as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). SARS-CoV-2 appears to infect cells by first binding and priming its viral-spike proteins with membrane-associated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Through the coordinated actions of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins fuse with plasma membranes and ultimately the virus enters cells. ACE2 is integral to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and SARS-CoV-2 down-regulates protein expression levels of ACE2. Once infected, patients typically develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a number of other severe complications that result in a high rate of fatality, especially in older (>60 years) adults and in people with pre-existing medical conditions. Data now indicate clearly that among people of all age groups, COVID-19 fatalities are higher in men than women. Here, attention is focused on these sex differences and posit a role of estrogen in these differences as well as possible therapeutic and protective actions of 17ß-estradiol against COVID-19.","Khan, Nabab",J Allergy Infect Dis,,150
357433,Conversation moves on: revisiting early-career researchers and a new focus on fieldwork,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of this study were to synthesise and compare pandemic preparedness strategies issued by the federal and provincial/territorial (P/T) governments in Canada and to assess whether COVID-19 public health (PH) measures were tailored towards priority populations, as defined by relevant social determinants of health. METHODS: This scoping review searched federal and P/T websites on daily COVID-19 pandemic preparedness strategies between 30 January and 30 April 2020. The PROGRESS-Plus equity-lens framework was used to define priority populations. All definitions, policies and guidelines of PH strategies implemented by the federal and P/T governments to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission were included. PH measures were classified using a modified Public Health Agency of Canada Framework for Canadian Pandemic Influenza Preparedness. RESULTS: A total of 722 COVID-19 PH measures were issued during the study period. Of these, home quarantine (voluntary) (n=13.0%; 94/722) and retail/commerce restrictions (10.9%; n=79/722) were the most common measures introduced. Many of the PH orders, including physical distancing, cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures or retail/commerce restrictions began to be introduced after 11 March 2020. Lifting of some of the PH orders in phases to reopen the economy began in April 2020 (6.5%; n=47/722). The majority (68%, n=491/722) of COVID-19 PH announcements were deemed mandatory, while 32% (n=231/722) were recommendations. Several PH measures (28.0%, n=202/722) targeted a variety of groups at risk of socially produced health inequalities, such as age, religion, occupation and migration status. CONCLUSIONS: Most PH measures centred on limiting contact between people who were not from the same household. PH measures were evolutionary in nature, reflecting new evidence that emerged throughout the pandemic. Although ~30% of all implemented COVID-19 PH measures were tailored towards priority groups, there were still unintended consequences on these populations.","Polisena, Julie; Ospina, Maria; Sanni, Omolara; Matenchuk, Brittany; Livergant, Rachel; Amjad, Sana; Zoric, Igor; Haddad, Nisrine; Morrison, Andra; Wilson, Kumanan; Bogoch, Isaac; Welch, Vivian A",BMJ Open,,150

We aimed to compare the differences in clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with and without cancer. METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study of consecutive adult patients hospitalised in a COVID-19 unit at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France (NCT04320017). RESULTS: Among the 262 patients hospitalised in a medical ward during the pandemics with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, 62 patients had cancer. Clinical presentation, comorbidities, and outcomes were similar between cancer and non-cancer patients. However, cancer patients were more likely to have been contaminated while being hospitalised. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologic and non-oncologic patients hospitalised for COVID-19 shared similar outcomes in terms of death, admission in intensive care, or thrombosis/bleeding. They should benefit from the same therapeutic strategy as the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fenioux, Charlotte; Allenbach, Yves; Vozy, Aurore; Salem, Joe-Élie; Maalouf, Georgina; Vieira, Matheus; Le Joncour, Alexandre; Benveniste, Olivier; Saadoun, David; Frère, Corinne; Campedel, Luca; Salem, Pierre; Gligorov, Joseph; Funck-Brentano, Christian; Cacoub, Patrice; Gougis, Paul",Bull Cancer,,150

We investigated alcohol use during lockdown in a population of college students, usually characterized by social and heavy drinking. We also tested the predictive role of pre-lockdown drinking motives on alcohol consumption during lockdown. We collected data from 1951 French-speaking Belgian students during the lockdown period (April 1st - May 3rd, 2020) through a cross-sectional online survey. Participants self-reported their daily alcohol consumption (1) during a typical week in normal circumstances (i.e., before lockdown), and (2) since lockdown onset. We also assessed drinking motives and severity of alcohol use before lockdown. Our findings showed that 68.2% of the sample reported a lower alcohol consumption during lockdown compared to before lockdown, 17.2% conversely reporting a higher consumption. Enhancement, social and coping motives were all associated with heavy drinking before lockdown. Enhancement and social motives predicted lower alcohol consumption during lockdown among heavy drinkers. Conversely, coping motives, as well as social motives among low drinkers, predicted higher consumption during lockdown. Conformity motives, as well as enhancement motives among low and moderate drinkers, did not predict alcohol consumption before or during lockdown. Overall, several pre-lockdown drinking motives reliably predicted alcohol consumption during lockdown and could thus be used to identify at-risk populations and to tailor intervention programs on alcohol misuse during sanitary crises.","Bollen, Zoé; Pabst, Arthur; Creupelandt, Coralie; Fontesse, Sullivan; Lannoy, Séverine; Pinon, Nicolas; Maurage, Pierre",Addict Behav,,150

After scoring the level of infection risk, safety procedures, advice and personal protective equipment (PPE) are recommended for the dental team in each dental practice. METHODS: The authors of this research analysed 42 common dental procedures on the basis of known transmission risks. In increasing order, many consider the parameters leading to different risk scores for the dental team and patients for each procedure to be: direct contact with saliva (score 1), direct contact with blood (score 2), production of low levels of spray/aerosol via air-water syringes (score 3), the production of high levels of spray/aerosol from rotating, ultrasound and piezoelectric tools (score 4); and the duration of the procedure, which may increase the risk of procedures producing droplets and aerosols. RESULTS: Using this innovative risk-scoring system, the authors classified the different dental procedures according to low, medium or high risk: low (1-3), medium (4-5), high (&#8805; 6). A safety protocol for each procedure was thereafter matched with the calculated risk level. CONCLUSIONS: The innovative risk-scoring system presented in this research permits the reclassification of dental procedures according to the infection risk level. Consequently, specific procedures, previously considered as entry level, will now merit revision. This paper also highlighted an effective and routine clinical tool for general dentists and oral medicine practitioners.","Bizzoca, M E; Campisi, G; Lo Muzio, Lorenzo",BMC Oral Health,,150

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of interferon (IFN) with or without lopinavir and ritonavir as antiviral therapeutic option for treating COVID-19 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study enrolled 148 patients that received either standard care, treatment with IFN alfa-2b, or IFN alfa-2b combined with lopinavir plus ritonavir. Viral testing was performed using Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the viral-clearance time at 28 days after treatment between patients receiving standard care and those receiving anti-viral treatments. However, the average viral-clearance time of patients receiving standard care (14 days) was shorter than that for patients receiving IFN alfa-2b or IFN alfa-2b combined with lopinavir plus ritonavir (15.5 or 17.5 days) (p<0.05). Patients treated with IFN alfa-2b within five days or IFN alfa-2b combined with lopinavir plus ritonavir after three days of symptoms exhibited shorter viral-clearance times than the other groups (p<0.05). Moreover, viral-clearance times were significantly longer in patients receiving standard care or anti-viral treatment 5 days after symptoms appeared than those of patients who received these treatments within five days of symptom onset (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Early symptomatic treatment is most critical for maximizing amelioration of COVID-19 infection. Anti-viral treatment might have complicated effect on viral-clearance.","Liu, J-Y; Hua, M-X; Du, C-J; Pu, L; Xiang, P; Li, C-S; Xiong, H-F; Liu, X-Z; Chen, Z-H; Xie, W; Li, A",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,150

Current research reveals a wide array of disease manifestations and behaviors encompassing multiple organ systems in body and immense systemic inflammation, which have been summarized in this review. Data from a number of scientific reviews, research articles, case series, observational studies, and case reports were retrieved by utilizing online search engines such as Cochrane, PubMed, and Scopus from December 2019 to November 2020. The data for prevalence of signs and symptoms, underlying disease mechanisms and comorbidities were analyzed using SPSS version 25. This review will discuss a wide range of COVID-19 clinical presentations recorded till date, and the current understanding of both the underlying general as well as system specific pathophysiologic, and pathogenetic pathways. These include direct viral penetration into host cells through ACE2 receptors, induction of inflammosomes and immune response through viral proteins, and the initiation of system-wide inflammation and cytokine production. Moreover, peripheral organ damage and underlying comorbid diseases which can lead to short term and long term, reversible and irreversible damage to the body have also been studied. We concluded that underlying comorbidities and their pathological effects on the body contributed immensely and determine the resultant disease severity and mortality of the patients. Presently there is no drug approved for treatment of COVID-19, however multiple vaccines are now in use and research for more is underway.","Shakaib, Baila; Zohra, Tanzeel; Ikram, Aamer; Shakaib, Muhammad Bin; Ali, Amna; Bashir, Adnan; Salman, Muhammad; Khan, Mumtaz Ali; Ansari, Jamil",Virol J,,150

The interview was broadcast both live and online by a private television station, on April 15, 2020, and supplementary informationwas obtained from reliable news stories published by various mass media and from interviews with various groups of people. We identified the limited availability of personal protective equipment among health workers, a public lack of clear understanding regarding COVID-19, the distortion of news by various media, and a lack of clarity among those responsible for providing education, information, and communication. The government has not acted in a sufficiently prompt mannerto prevent the spread of imported infectious diseases, resulting in local transmission and creating various stigmasamong local communities.

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response was quantified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 87 COVID-19 convalescent subjects (range 7-239 days after symptom onset) and 33 unexposed donors by ex vivo ELISpot assay. Follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response was performed in ten subjects up to 12 months after symptom onset. The role of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 and CD8 T cells was characterized in a group of COVID-19 convalescent subjects. Moreover, neutralizing antibodies were determined in serum samples. RESULTS: In 14/33 (42.4%) unexposed donors and 85/87 (97.7%) COVID-19 convalescent subjects a positive result for at least one SARS-CoV-2 antigen was observed. A positive response was observed up to 12 months after COVID-19 infection (median 246 days after symptom onset; range 118-362 days). Of note, SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response seems to be mainly mediated by CD4 T cells. A weak positive correlation was observed between Spike-specific T-cell response and neutralizing antibody titre (p 0.0028; r2 = 0.2891) and positive SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response was observed in 8/9 (88.9%) COVID-19 convalescent subjects with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. DISCUSSION: Cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response in uninfected patients may be due to previous infections with other common coronaviruses. Our data suggest that long-term SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response might accompany a waning humoral response.","Cassaniti, Irene; Percivalle, Elena; Bergami, Federica; Piralla, Antonio; Comolli, Giuditta; Bruno, Raffaele; Vecchia, Marco; Sambo, Margherita; Colaneri, Marta; Zuccaro, Valentina; Benazzo, Marco; Robotti, Carlo; Calastri, Anna; Maiorano, Eugenia; Ferrari, Alessandro; Cambiè, Giuseppe; Baldanti, Fausto",Clin Microbiol Infect,,150
378079,Vaccination combats antimicrobial resistance,2020,"Influenza virus and coronavirus, belonging to enveloped RNA viruses, are major causes of human respiratory diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the broad spectrum antiviral activity of a naturally existing sulfated polysaccharide, lambda-carrageenan (&#955;-CGN), purified from marine red algae. Cell culture-based assays revealed that the macromolecule efficiently inhibited both influenza A and B viruses with EC50 values ranging from 0.3 to 1.4 µg/ml, as well as currently circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with an EC50 value of 0.9 ± 1.1 µg/ml. No toxicity to the host cells was observed at concentrations up to 300 µg/ml. Plaque titration and western blot analysis verified that &#955;-CGN reduced expression of viral proteins in cell lysates and suppressed progeny virus production in culture supernatants in a dose-dependent manner. This polyanionic compound exerts antiviral activity by targeting viral attachment to cell surface receptors and preventing virus entry. Moreover, its intranasal administration to mice during influenza A viral challenge not only alleviated infection-mediated reductions in body weight but also protected 60% of mice from virus-induced mortality. Thus, &#955;-CGN could be a promising antiviral agent for preventing infection with several respiratory viruses.","Jang, Yejin; Shin, Heegwon; Lee, Myoung Kyu; Kwon, Oh Seung; Shin, Jin Soo; Kim, Yong-Il; Kim, Chan Woo; Lee, Hye-Ra; Kim, Meehyein",Sci Rep,,150

Several neurological complications have emerged in association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), since its declaration as a pandemic. Herein, we present a novel case of unexplained worsening of PD as the sole initial presentation of COVID-19, in the absence of fever or respiratory symptoms.Case presentationA 56-year-old male with advanced PD presented with severe rigidity, dystonic posturing of both feet, and confusion of 4 days duration. His condition progressed to an akinetic-rigid state and confusion during the following week, and a routine nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the 9th day of onset. He developed fever and dyspnea later and was intubated on the 10th day.ConclusionTo our knowledge, worsening of PD symptoms as the sole initial manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the absence of other cardinal features of COVID-19, has not been reported in the literature. We suggest testing for COVID-19 infection in patients with PD, especially advanced cases, who present with unexplained worsening of symptoms, even in the absence of COVID-19 cardinal features.","Kamel, Walaa A.; Ismail Ismail, Ibrahim Ibrahim Mohamed Al-Hashel Jasem Y.","The Egyptian Journal of Neurology, Psychiatry, and Neurosurgery",,150

384279,"Offline: A dangerous virus, but not the one you think",2020,"The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine storm (CS) in lungs leads to the high mortality in COVID-19 patients. To reduce ARDS, an ideal approach is to diminish virus loading by activating immune cells for CS prevention or to suppress the overactive cytokine-releasing immune cells for CS inhibition. Here, a potential radiation-mediated CS regulation is raised by reevaluating the radiation-mediated pneumonia control in the 1920s, with the following latent advantages of lung radiotherapy (LR) in treatment of COVID-19: (1) radiation accesses poorly circulated tissue more efficiently than blood-delivered medications; (2) low-dose radiation (LDR)-mediated metabolic rewiring and immune cell activation inhibit virus loading; (3) pre-consumption of immune reserves by LDR decreases CS severity; (4) higherdose radiation (HDR) within lung-tolerable doses relieves CS by eliminating in situ overactive cytokine-releasing cells. Thus, LDR and HDR or combined with antiviral and life-supporting modalities may mitigate SARS-CoV-2 and other virus-mediated ARDS.","Li, Jian Jian",iScience,,150

Young individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are particularly at risk due to their vulnerability to unpredictable and complex changes. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ASD individuals, whether any pre-pandemic sociodemographic or clinical characteristics would predict a negative outcome, and to narratively characterize their needs. Parents and guardians of ASD individuals filled out an online survey consisting of 40 questions investigating socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of their children, impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on their wellbeing and needs to deal with the emergency. Data were available on 527 survey participants. The COVID-19 emergency resulted in a challenging period for 93.9% of families, increased difficulties in managing daily activities, especially free time (78.1%) and structured activities (75.7%), and, respectively, 35.5% and 41.5% of children presenting with more intense and more frequent behavior problems. Behavior problems predating the COVID-19 outbreak predicted a higher risk of more intense (odds ratio (OR) = 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-3.29) and more frequent (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.13-2.48) disruptive behavior. Even though ASD children were receiving different types of support, also requiring specialist (19.1%) or emergency (1.5%) interventions in a relatively low proportion of cases, a number of needs emerged, including receiving more healthcare support (47.4%), especially in-home support (29.9%), as well as interventions to tackle a potentially disruptive quarantine (16.8%). The COVID-19 outbreak has undoubtedly resulted in increased difficulties among ASD individuals.","Colizzi, Marco; Sironi, Elena; Antonini, Federico; Ciceri, Marco Luigi; Bovo, Chiara; Zoccante, Leonardo",,,150

Material and Methods: In a case-control study, 14 patients with severe bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia (positive RT-PCR), treated with SOC and rectal ozone, were evaluated before-and-after treatment and compared with SOC (14 patients) in a 10-day follow-up period. Ozone protocol consisted of 8 sessions (1 session/day) of intra-rectal ozone (150 mL volume, 35 µg/mL concentration [5.25mg total dose]). The SOC protocol included O2 supply, antivirals (Remdesivir), corticosteroids (Dexamethasone/Metilprednisolone), monoclonal antibodies (Anakinra/Tocilizumab), antibiotics (Azytromicine), and anticoagulants (Enoxaparine). Primary outcome variables were the following: (a) clinical (O2 saturation and O2 supply); (b) biochemical (lymphocyte count, fibrinogen, D-dimer, urea, ferritin, LDH, IL-6, and CRP); (c) radiological Taylor's scale. Secondary outcome variables were the following: (a) hospitalization length of stay, (b) mortality rate. Results: At baseline, ozone/SOC groups were not different on age, comorbidities, O2 saturation, and O2 supply. Patients in the ozone group improved O2 saturation and decrease O2 supply. SOC maintained O2 saturation and required more O2 supply. Lymphocyte count improved only in the ozone group and with statistical difference (p<0.05). Biomarkers of inflammation (fibrinogen, D-dimer, urea, LDH, CRP, and IL-6) decreased in both groups, but only significantly in favor of the ozone group (p<0.05). Ferritin showed a significant decrease in the ozone group but an increase on the SOC group. Radiological pneumonitis decreased on both groups but the decrease was only significant in the ozone group (p<0.0001). Mortality and length of stay, although not significant, were inferior in the ozone group. Conclusion: Compassionate use of rectal ozone improved O2 saturation, reduced O2 supply, decreased inflammation biomarkers, and improved Taylor's radiological scale significantly when compared to the SOC group.

397437,Pre-Clinical Assessment of Single-Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy During In Vivo Porcine Wound Healing,2020,"BACKGROUND: Existing studies have demonstrated that behavioural barriers impede eHealth usage among senior citizens. However, thus far, no analysis of how such barriers affect elderly people with disabilities (PwD) has been conducted. Thus, the study investigates the predictors of eHealth usage among elderly PwD. METHODS: Using data from a 2018 nationwide disability survey comprising 14,798 respondents in Australia, multivariate logistic regression models are used to predict the relationship between eHealth usage and the various characteristics of respondents, including access to information and communication technologies (ICTs), socioeconomic status, and level of education. RESULTS: Although most participants (approximately 88%) have access to ICTs, few (only around 9%) have used eHealth services. The results show a number of factors are associated with an increased likelihood of using eHealth services, including higher educational attainment (odds ratio [OR] = 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.38, 4.24), employment (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.94), higher household income (OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.96), and ICT access (OR = 15.92, 95% CI: 10.51, 27.01). The probability of eHealth use is lower for the oldest-old (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.45). In addition, the estimates from interaction effects suggest the effect of ICT penetration on use of eHealth falls by a negligible amount because of resistive attitudinal barriers (OR = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.06). CONCLUSION: Given the challenges of ageing populations and pandemics, such as COVID-19, eHealth services are a vital part of an effective, inclusive, and robust health care system. This study demonstrates the presence of a significant digital divide among elderly PwD and suggests that public and private efforts should be made to increase the availability of ICT infrastructure. Training could also increase inclusion in this regard.","Ali, Mohammad Afshar; Alam, Khorshed; Taylor, Brad; Ashraf, Mahfuz",Int J Med Inform,,150
398295,Should I stay or should I go?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been confirmed to participate in the regulation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Here, we endeavored to explore the character of lncRNA ILF3-AS1 in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma and its function. METHODS: A total of 68 nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues and adjacent normal nasopharyngeal tissues were collected. Expressions of lncRNA ILF3-AS1 in these tissues were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The relationship between the expression level of lncRNA ILF3-AS1 and clinical pathological characteristics was analyzed. Inhibition of lncRNA ILF3-AS1 was done using small interference RNA. RESULTS: lncRNA ILF3-AS1 expression was significantly up-regulated in the 68 nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissue samples compared to their adjacent normal tissue samples. Increased lncRNA ILF3-AS1 level was related to the advanced tumor node metastasis stage and the metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Also, increased lncRNA ILF3-AS1 indicated poor prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. Inhibition of lncRNA ILF3-AS1 reduced proliferation, invasion and migration of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. MicroRNA-320a (miR-320a) was determined as a direct target for lncRNA ILF3-AS1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Furthermore, lncRNA ILF3-AS1 could sponge miR-320a to promote BMI1 expression. The expression of BMI1 was significantly inhibited by the down-regulation of lncRNA ILF3-AS1. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we demonstrated that lncRNA ILF3-AS1 was markedly over-expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues and cells. Elevated lncRNA ILF3-AS1 expression was correlated with severe cancer stage and poor prognosis. lncRNA ILF3-AS1 could promote proliferation, invasion, and migration of cells, which might indicate a novel target site for the future diagnosis and therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","Yang, Xuewen; Lin, Feng; Gao, Feng",Int J Biol Markers,,150

For this, a transcultural adaptation to Spanish of the fear of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) scale, in its original version of 10 items, was carried out. Then, the Anxiety and Fear of COVID-19 Assessment Scale (AMICO, for its acronym in Spanish) was designed by translating the tool and Delphi technique into three rounds. Ten experts participated voluntarily, and inter-observer match rates and the reliability study of the designed scale were calculated. A pilot study was carried out with the final version of the scale for the validity and reliability study. The instrument did not raise problems in semantic and cultural terms during the first and second rounds of the translation process, with an overall weighted Kappa value of 0.9. In the third round, eight new items were designed and consensual, obtaining a weighted overall value of 0.89. The pilot study sample was made up of 445 subjects, of which 60.3% were women with a mean age of 46.2 years. The final version consisted of 16 items, 2 factors, and a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.92. The AMICO scale was developed to assess the level of anxiety and fear of COVID-19 and proved to be valid and reliable for its use in the adult Spanish population.","Gómez-Salgado, Juan; Allande-Cussó, Regina; Domínguez-Salas, Sara; García-Iglesias, Juan Jesús; Coronado-Vázquez, Valle; Ruiz-Frutos, Carlos",,,150

403312,Coronaviruses Detected in Bats in Close Contact with Humans in Rwanda,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Clinicians evaluating for herpes simplex virus (HSV) in febrile infants must balance detection with overtesting, and there is no universally accepted approach to risk stratification. We aimed to describe variation in diagnostic evaluation and empirical acyclovir treatment of infants aged 0 to 60 days presenting with fever and determine the association between testing and length of stay (LOS). METHODS: In this retrospective 44-hospital observational study, we used the Pediatric Health Information System database to identify infants aged &#8804;60 days evaluated for fever in emergency departments from January 2016 through December 2017. We described hospital-level variation in laboratory testing, including HSV, imaging and other diagnostic evaluations, acyclovir use, and LOS. We assessed the relationship between HSV testing and LOS using generalized linear mixed effects models adjusted for age and illness severity. RESULTS: In 24 535 encounters for fever, the median HSV testing frequency across hospitals was 35.6% (interquartile range [IQR]: 28.5%-53.5%) for infants aged 0 to 21 days and 12% (IQR: 8.6%-15.7%) for infants aged 22 to 60 days. Among HSV-tested patients, median acyclovir use across hospitals was 79.2% (IQR: 68.1%-89.7%) for those aged 0 to 21 days and 63.6% (IQR: 44.1%-73%) for those aged 22 to 60 days. The prevalence of additional testing varied substantially by hospital and age group. Risk-adjusted LOS for HSV-tested infants was significantly longer than risk-adjusted LOS for those not tested (2.6 vs 1.9 days, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Substantial variation exists in diagnostic evaluation and acyclovir use, and infants who received HSV testing had a longer LOS than infants who did not. This variability supports the need for further studies to help clinicians better risk-stratify febrile infants and to guide HSV testing and treatment decisions.","Treasure, Jennifer D; Shah, Samir S; Hall, Matt; Mahant, Sanjay; Berry, Jay G; Kimberlin, David W; Schondelmeyer, Amanda C",Hosp. pediatr.

There was concern this would affect health seeking behaviour leading to delayed presentation and worse outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of these interventions on rate and severity of acute general surgical admissions in Northland, New Zealand. METHODS: A retrospective comparative cohort study was performed. Two cohorts were identified: 28 February to 8 June 2020 and same period in 2019. Data for surgical admissions and operations and emergency department (ED) presentation were obtained from the hospital data warehouse. Three index diagnoses were assessed for severity. RESULTS: There were 650 acute general surgical admissions in 2019 and 627 in 2020 (P 0.353). Operations were performed in 226 and 224 patients respectively (P 0.829). ED presentations decreased from 11 398 to 8743 (P < 0.001). No difference in severity of acute appendicitis (P 0.970), acute diverticulitis (P 0.333) or acute pancreatitis (P 0.803) was detected. Median length-of-stay, 30-day mortality and admission diagnosis were comparable.

METHODS AND RESULTS: This observational study was performed using Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) Tuscany COVID-19 database by the Agenzia Regionale Sanità (ARS), including all COVID-19 cases registered until April 30th, 2020, with reported information on chronic diseases. The principal outcome was hospitalization. An age and gender-adjusted logistic regression model was used to assess the association of clinical and demographic characteristics with hospitalization. Further multivariate models were applied. Of 4481 included subjects (36.9% aged over 70 years), 1907 (42.6%) were admitted to hospital. Obesity was associated with hospitalization after adjusting for age and gender. The association of obesity with hospitalization retained statistical significance in a fully adjusted model, including possible confounders (OR: 2.99 [IC 95% 2.04-4.37]). The effect of obesity was more evident in younger (<70 years) than in older (&#8805;70 years) subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The present data confirm that obesity is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. Interestingly, the association of obesity with hospitalization was greater in younger (<70 years) patients.","Bellini, Benedetta; Cresci, Barbara; Cosentino, Claudia; Profili, Francesco; Bartolacci, Simone; Scoccimarro, Daniele; Voller, Fabio; Balzi, Daniela; Francesconi, Paolo; Mannucci, Edoardo",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,,150

The objective of this study is to assess the prognostic capability of these tests in predicting clinical outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including all patients at least 16 years old with COVID-19 who were admitted from one of five Emergency Departments between March 6th and April 4th, 2020. We included 1123 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. We analyzed white blood cell count (WBC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, ferritin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). We looked at clinical outcomes including death, the need for endotracheal intubation (ETT), the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), and ICU admission. We report Spearman's &#961;2 and statistical significance for each correlation with outcomes. We also report positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, and negative likelihood ratios. RESULTS: The mean age of our patient population was 62 (SD 16). Thirty-seven percent of patients self-reported Spanish/Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, 47% reported their race as Black or African-American, and 10% reported their race as non-Hispanic white. Inter-rater reliability was 96%. There was no laboratory value that had both sensitivity and specificity of at least 0.90, or that had a positive predictive value and negative predictive value of at least 0.90, or that had likelihood ratios that could reliably predict a severe course of disease. CONCLUSION: Inflammatory markers drawn within 48 h of arrival, though often correlated with clinical outcomes, are not individually highly predictive of which patients in a predominantly older and minority population will die or require intubation, RRT, or ICU admission.","Barrett, Brendan; Pamphile, Styve; Yang, Fan; Naeem, Farnia; Kim, Jinsung; Annam, Jayabhargav; Borczuk, Rachel; Yellin, Shira; Bass, Carly; Fowler, Sabrina; Mosheyev, Maykl; Mayer, Yael Jessica; Friedman, Benjamin W",Am. j. emerg. med,,150

In this study, nanoselenium (nano-Se) was sprayed on pepper leaves, and the pepper components were compared to those of selenite. It was found that nano-Se (20 mg/L) resulted in a greater performance of plant health. It increased the chlorophyll and soluble sugar levels, which could activate phenylpropane and branched-chain fatty acid pathways, as well as AT3-related enzymes and gene expressions. These led to an enhancement for the synthesis of capsaicinoids, flavonoids, and total phenols. The nano-Se treatment also significantly promoted the expression of phyto-hormones synthesis genes, and consequently increased jasmonic, abscisic, and salicylic acid levels. Proline pathway-related compounds were increased, which could decrease the malondialdehyde and hydroxyl radical levels in crops. This study shows that nano-Se activated capsaicinoid pathways by enhancing photosynthesis and raising soluble sugar levels. The capsaicinoid contents in peppers were then increased, which consequently promoted the accumulation of secondary metabolites and antioxidants.","Li, Dong; Zhou, Chunran; Zhang, Jingbang; An, Quanshun; Wu, Yangliu; Li, Jia-Qi; Pan, Canping",J. agric.

We have investigated the cellular source and functions of several prostanoids in the immune inflammatory responses using follicular dendritic cell (FDC)-like cells. In this study, we report a novel finding on the role of 15(S)- hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE). Our observation of 15(S)-HETE uptake by FDC-like cells prompted to hypothesize that 15(S)-HETE might have a regulatory role in the other branch of eicosanoid production. The effects of 15(S)-HETE on COX-2 expression and prostaglandin (PG) production were analyzed by immunoblotting and specific enzyme immunoassays. The addition of 15(S)-HETE resulted in elevated levels of COX-2 expression and PG production. The enhanced PG production was not due to growth stimulation of FDC-like cells since 15(S)-HETE did not modulate FDC-like cell proliferation by the culture period of PG measurement. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³) seems to mediate the augmenting activity as the antagonist GW9662 dose- dependently prevented 15(S)-HETE from increasing PG production. In addition, PPARÎ³ protein expression was readily detected in FDC-like cells. These effects of 15(S)-HETE were displayed in the combined addition with IL-1ß. Based on these results, we suggest that 15(S)-HETE is an inflammatory costimulator of FDC acting in a paracrine fashion.","Kim, Jini; Choe, Jongseon",Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat,,150
420402,The impact of MicroRNAs (miRNAs) on the genotype of coronaviruses,2020,"The coronaviral spike is the dominant viral antigen and the target of neutralizing antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike binds biliverdin and bilirubin, the tetrapyrrole products of heme metabolism, with nanomolar affinity. Using cryo-electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography, we mapped the tetrapyrrole interaction pocket to a deep cleft on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). At physiological concentrations, biliverdin significantly dampened the reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 spike with immune sera and inhibited a subset of neutralizing antibodies. Access to the tetrapyrrole-sensitive epitope is gated by a flexible loop on the distal face of the NTD. Accompanied by profound conformational changes in the NTD, antibody binding requires relocation of the gating loop, which folds into the cleft vacated by the metabolite. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 spike NTD harbors a dominant epitope, access to which can be controlled by an allosteric mechanism that is regulated through recruitment of a metabolite.","Rosa, Annachiara; Pye, Valerie E; Graham, Carl; Muir, Luke; Seow, Jeffrey; Ng, Kevin W; Cook, Nicola J; Rees-Spear, Chloe; Parker, Eleanor; Dos Santos, Mariana Silva; Rosadas, Carolina; Susana, Alberto; Rhys, Hefin; Nans, Andrea; Masino, Laura; Roustan, Chloe; Christodoulou, Evangelos; Ulferts, Rachel; Wrobel, Antoni G; Short, Charlotte-Eve; Fertleman, Michael; Sanders, Rogier W; Heaney, Judith; Spyer, Moira; Kjær, Svend; Riddell, Andy; Malim, Michael H; Beale, Rupert; MacRae, James I; Taylor, Graham P; Nastouli, Eleni; van Gils, Marit J; Rosenthal, Peter B; Pizzato, Massimo; McClure, Myra O; Tedder, Richard S; Kassiotis, George; McCoy, Laura E; Doores, Katie J; Cherepanov, Peter",Sci.

Because of its sudden onset and highly contagious nature, the world has responded in a ""crisis management"" manner. With effective vaccines almost available, it is appropriate at this time to have some reflections about COVID-19 in relation to the quality of life issues. In this paper, we highlight twelve issues for reflection, which can help us better prepared for future pandemics. These include: digital divide, health inequality, gender inequality, economic disadvantage, family well-being, impact on holistic well-being, economic development versus saving lives, consumption versus environmental protection, individual rights versus collective rights, international collaboration versus conflict, prevention of negative well-being, and promotion of positive well-being.","Shek, Daniel T L",Appl Res Qual Life,,150
424946,Corrigendum,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly emerged coronavirus that is responsible for the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in more than 3.7 million infections and 260,000 deaths as of 6 May 20201,2. Vaccine and therapeutic discovery efforts are paramount to curb the pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein promotes entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe several monoclonal antibodies that target the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, which we identified from memory B cells of an individual who was infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003. One antibody (named S309) potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2, by engaging the receptor-binding domain of the S glycoprotein. Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show that S309 recognizes an epitope containing a glycan that is conserved within the Sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment. Antibody cocktails that include S309 in combination with other antibodies that we identified further enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, and may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants. These results pave the way for using S309 and antibody cocktails containing S309 for prophylaxis in individuals at a high risk of exposure or as a post-exposure therapy to limit or treat severe disease.","Pinto, Dora; Park, Young-Jun; Beltramello, Martina; Walls, Alexandra C; Tortorici, M Alejandra; Bianchi, Siro; Jaconi, Stefano; Culap, Katja; Zatta, Fabrizia; De Marco, Anna; Peter, Alessia; Guarino, Barbara; Spreafico, Roberto; Cameroni, Elisabetta; Case, James Brett; Chen, Rita E; Havenar-Daughton, Colin; Snell, Gyorgy; Telenti, Amalio; Virgin, Herbert W; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Diamond, Michael S; Fink, Katja; Veesler, David; Corti, Davide",Nature,,150

INNOVATION: Oregon Health & Science University's primary care team envisioned and implemented the COVID-19 Connected Care Center, a statewide telephone ""hotline"" service. RESULTS: The hotline has taken more than 5825 calls from patients in 33 of Oregon's 36 counties in less than 3 months. In preliminary survey data, 86% of patients said their questions were answered during the call, 90% would recommend this service, and 70% reported a reduction in stress levels about coronavirus. In qualitative interviews, patients reported their questions answered, short wait times, nurses spent time as needed, and appropriate follow-up was arranged. CONCLUSION: Academic health centers may have the capacity to leverage their extensive resources to rapidly launch a multiphased pandemic response that meets peoples' need for information and access to primary care, while minimizing risk of infection and emergency department use and rapidly supporting primary care teams to make the necessary operational changes to do the same in their communities.

METHODS: Analysis of the first 8 weeks of observational multicentre prospective cohort study (ReumaCoV Brasil register). Patients with IMRD and COVID-19 according to the Ministry of Health criteria were classified as eligible for the study. RESULTS: 334 participants were enrolled, a majority of them women, with a median age of 45 years; systemic lupus erythematosus (32.9%) was the most frequent IMRD. Emergency care was required in 160 patients, 33.0% were hospitalised, 15.0% were admitted to the ICU and 10.5% underwent mechanical ventilation; 28 patients (8.4%) died. In the multivariate adjustment model for emergency care, diabetes (prevalence ratio, PR 1.38; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.73; p=0.004), kidney disease (PR 1.36; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.77; p=0.020), oral glucocorticoids (GC) (PR 1.49; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.85; p<0.001) and pulse therapy with methylprednisolone (PR 1.38; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.67; p=0.001) remained significant; for hospitalisation, age >50 years (PR 1.89; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.85; p=0.002), no use of tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) (PR 2.51;95% CI 1.16 to 5.45; p=0.004) and methylprednisolone pulse therapy (PR 2.50; 95% CI 1.59 to 3.92; p<0.001); for ICU admission, oral GC (PR 2.24; 95% CI 1.36 to 3.71; p<0.001) and pulse therapy with methylprednisolone (PR 1.65; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.68; p<0.043); the two variables associated with death were pulse therapy with methylprednisolone or cyclophosphamide (PR 2.86; 95% CI 1.59 to 5.14; p<0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Age >50 years and immunosuppression with GC and cyclophosphamide were associated with unfavourable outcomes of COVID-19.

Using the term ""differential diversification"" from Singapore, I examine how the socio-political life of the pandemic is deeply entangled with the management of low-waged labour migrants. Techno-political discourses and practices of pandemic management accelerated the state's attempts to differently include migrant workers, revealing the bare viscerality of biopolitics already in place prior to the pandemic. I argue that diversity is ordered through a striking co-production of migrant management and pandemic management. This paper draws upon government discourses to demonstrate that measures of pandemic management contribute not only to the spatial regime of migrant management. They also articulate and rationalise the subject transformation of the low-waged migrant to the extent that, on top of being a moral risk, they are also now a medical risk.","Ye, Junjia",Antipode,,150

Clinical characteristics and outcomes among patients with orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) with COVID-19 remain poorly described. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of patients with OHT with COVID-19 admitted to 1 of 2 hospitals in Southeastern Michigan between March 21 and April 22, 2020. Clinical data were obtained through review of the electronic medical record. Final date of follow-up was May 7, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiologic, treatment, and mortality data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 13 patients with OHT admitted with COVID-19. The mean age of patients was 61 ± 12 years, 100% were black males, and symptoms began 6 ± 4 days before admission. The most common symptoms included subjective fever (92%), shortness of breath (85%), and cough (77%). Six patients (46%) required admission to the intensive care unit. Two patients (15%) died during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Black men may be at increased risk for COVID-19 among patients with OHT. Presenting signs and symptoms in this cohort are similar to those in the general population. Elevated inflammatory markers on presentation appear to be associated with more severe illness.","Ketcham, Scott W; Adie, Sarah K; Malliett, Ashley; Abdul-Aziz, Ahmad A; Bitar, Abbas; Grafton, Gillian; Konerman, Matthew C",J Card Fail,,150

437825,"1,2,3-Triazoles as Biomimetics in Peptide Science",2021,"Community psychology, despite its commitment to social justice, is prone to engage in deficit-based perspectives that do not appropriately capture the strengths of Latinx communities. Given these limitations, we use a Community Cultural Wealth (CCW) (Yosso, 2005) framework to describe how muxeres, Latina women who identify as promotoras, madres, and mamás, leveraged their political power and culturally informed leadership to improve the health and well-being of their communities. We highlight instances from our fieldwork, witnessing the agency of muxeres en acción for health equity. We offer three case studies to describe how we approached our collaborations with three groups of muxeres situated in different geographic locations in the state of California. The first case study discusses how immigrant muxeres who identify as promotoras (e.g., health workers) in the Central Valley developed their research skills through a promotora model that allowed them to build the capacity to advocate for the well-being of their communities. The second example offers reflections from a Community-Based Participatory Action Research (CBPAR) project with a group of Mexican immigrant madres in a gentrified community in San José. Lastly, the third case study describes how a group of mamás in the East Side of Los Angeles addressed issues of educational inequities. Together, these case studies illustrate muxeres' advocacy for their health and well-being. Because women in general, and muxeres in particular, are considered gatekeepers of culture and tradition within their families, it is crucial that community psychologists ground their work in ethically and culturally appropriate frameworks that highlight the power of muxeres.","Fernández, Jesica Siham; Guzmán, Bianca L; Bernal, Ireri; Flores, Yvette G",Am. j. community psychol,,150

438534,Expanding Access to Remdesivir via an Improved Pyrrolotriazine Synthesis: Supply Centered Synthesis,2020,"COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is a public health emergency of international con-cern. There is a pressing urgency to find treatments based upon currently available scien-tific knowledge and epidemiological data. In this article, we provide a novel hypothesis describing how the severity of the pathology is mainly resulting from the Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) and not due to the direct action of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 appears to alter the endothelial cell. The pathophysiological mecha-nism is not yet elucidated. The damage caused resembles a systemic, multi-organ vascu-litis predominantly in the lungs. An increase in thromboembolic complications has been observed in COVID-19 patients. These are manifested by pulmonary embolisms or systemic microembolism manifested by microangiopathy affecting the lungs, brain, liver, kidneys and intestines. Therefore, we hypothesize that an auto-immune acquired Protein S (PS) deficiency may be involved in the pathogenesis of thrombotic events in Covid-19. Auto-antibodies to Protein S may form immune complexes, inducing increased clearance of PS or interfering with the protein C-protein S system. COVID-19 early thromboprophy-laxis in infected patients, or even effective anticoagulation, could prevent the progression to severe forms, thus reducing mortality in patients with COVID-19. Activated Protein C (APC), a physiological coagulation inhibitor with cytoprotective properties, could be an interesting avenue for the treatment of severe forms of the disease in intensive care; its administration in hypoxic patients could improve tissue oxygenation. Randomized resus-citation studies in patients with COVID19 are also needed to confirm our hypothesis.","Faiez, Amouri",J. Appl. Nat. Sci.,,150

Two sides of the same coin,2021,"The global financial crisis of just over a decade ago exposed longer-term systemic problems in global capitalism of which two of the most prominent are the slowdown in the underlying trend rate of productivity growth, alongside a rise in economic and spatial inequalities in many advanced economies. The Covid-19 pandemic looks set to further amplify these problems. This Editorial begins by discussing the scale of the productivity slowdown and of the widening inequalities that have emerged, particularly with regard to their spatial dimension: That is how the uneven and slow development of productivity and rise in inequalities have played out across and within regions and cities. It then briefly considers underlying factors that lie behind these trends, including financialisation/financial globalization, the diminishing role of organised labour, segmentation of the labour market favouring workers who play a key role in financialisation, together with the increasing polarisation within societies according to skill and, crucially, the impact of changing industrial composition particularly as it relates to the rise of the high-tech sectors. The Editorial then examines in what ways the slowdown of productivity and widening of economic and spatial inequalities, may be interrelated, and questions the notion of any efficiency-equity trade-off. Lastly, it considers whether the 'inclusive growth' agenda can potentially reconcile the two ambitions of improving productivity performance and lessening inequalities, reflecting on what inclusive growth could mean, and what it could imply in terms of policy. Thus far, it appears that an inclusive growth agenda has only gained some traction at the subnational level, which seems to reflect- A t least in part- A ttempts by cities and regions to address gaps in policy left by national governments. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

439438,The synthetic toxin biliatresone causes biliary atresia in mice,2020,"The nuclear lamins are the major components of the nuclear lamina in the nuclear envelope. Lamins are involved in numerous functions, including a role in providing structural support to the cell and the mechanosensing of the cell. Mutations in the genes encoding for lamins lead to the rare diseases termed laminopathies. However, not only laminopathies show alterations in the nuclear lamina. Deregulation of lamin expression is reported in multiple cancers and several viral infections lead to a disrupted nuclear lamina. The structural and mechanical effects of alterations in the nuclear lamina can partly explain the phenotypes seen in disease, such as muscular weakness in certain laminopathies and transmigration of cancer cells. However, a lot of answers to questions about the relation between changes in the nuclear lamina and disease development remain elusive. Here, we review the current understandings of the contribution of the nuclear lamina in the structural support and mechanosensing of healthy and diseased cells.","Stiekema, Merel; van Zandvoort, Marc A M J; Ramaekers, Frans C S; Broers, Jos L V",,,150

Even though causality has not yet been established, intestinal dysbiosis has emerged as a hallmark of several diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs). The fact that the microbiota and central nervous system are co-developing during the first years of life has provided a paradigm suggesting a potential role of psychobiotics for earlier interventions. Studies in animal models of early-life stress (ELS) have shown that they can counteract the pervasive effects of stress during this crucial developmental period, and rescue behavioral symptoms related to anxiety and depression later in life. In humans, evidence from clinical studies on the efficacy of psychobiotics at improving mental outcomes in most NPDs remain limited, except for major depressive disorder for which more studies are available. Consequently, the beneficial effect of psychobiotics on depression-related outcomes in adults are becoming clearer. While the specific mechanisms at play remain elusive, the effect of psychobiotics are generally considered to involve the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, intestinal permeability, and inflammation. It is anticipated that future clinical studies will explore the potential role of psychobiotics at mitigating the risk developing NPDs in vulnerable individuals or in the context of childhood adversity. However, such studies remain challenging at present in terms of design and target populations; the profound impact of stress on the proper development of the MGBA during the first year of life is becoming increasingly recognized, but the trajectories post-ELS in humans and the mechanisms by which stress affects the susceptibility to various NPDs are still ill-defined. As psychobiotics are likely to exert both shared and specific mechanisms, a better definition of target subpopulations would allow to tailor psychobiotics selection by aligning mechanistic properties with known pathophysiological mechanisms or risk factors. Here we review the available evidence from clinical and preclinical studies supporting a role for psychobiotics at ameliorating depression-related outcomes, highlighting the knowledge gaps and challenges associated with conducting longitudinal studies to address outstanding key questions in the field.","Tremblay, Annie; Lingrand, Lucie; Maillard, Morgane; Feuz, Berengere; Tompkins, Thomas A",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,150

The aim of our study is a comparative analysis of the differences between AM related and unrelated to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: The retrospective study included children with AM treated from January 2018 to November 2020. RESULTS: The study included 24 patients; 7 of 24 had AM related to SARS-CoV-2 and they were older than 7. They were more likely to have abdominal pain (P = 0.014), headache (P = 0.003), cutaneous rash (P = 0.003), and conjunctivitis (P = 0.003), while fulminant myocarditis was commonly registered in AM unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 (P = 0.04). A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 was diagnosed in six adolescents. Patients with AM related SARS-CoV-2 had lower serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (P = 0.012), and platelets (P < 0.001), but had a higher C-reactive protein (CRP) value (P = 0.04), and N-terminal-pro hormone BNP in comparison to patients with AM unrelated to SARS-CoV-2. The patients with AM related to SARS-CoV-2 had significant reduction of CRP (P = 0.007). Inotropic drug support was used for shorter durations in patients with AM related to SARS-CoV-2, than in others (P = 0.02). Children with AM related to SARS-CoV-2 had significant improvement of left ventricle systolic function on the third day in hospital (P = 0.001). Patients with AM unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 AM had more frequent adverse outcomes (P = 0.04; three died and four dilated cardiomyopathy). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to patients with AM unrelated to SARS-CoV-2, patients with AM related to SARS-CoV-2 had a higher CRP value, polymorphic clinical presentation, shorter durations of inotropic drugs use as well as prompt recovery of left ventricle systolic function.","Vukomanovic, Vladislav A; Krasic, Stasa; Prijic, Sergej; Ninic, Sanja; Minic, Predrag; Petrovic, Gordana; Nesic, Dejan",Pediatr Infect Dis J,,150

452594,Herd immunity by infection is not an option,2021,"The mass exodus of India's internal migrant workers, from urban areas, back to their villages during the Covid-19 lockdown was met with an outpouring of public empathy. However, policy responses remained restricted to relief, for what was conceived of as a temporary problem precipitated by the lockdown. The migrant workers crisis has been treated solely as an interstate mobility issue, while the lack of wage and employment security or hazardous work conditions, which are commonplace in urban labour markets, does not feature as part of the problem description. This is evident in the attack on workers' rights by state and central governments, through a labour reforms agenda under the garb of economic revival, even at the peak of the migrants' crisis. The article uses pre- and post-Covid evidence on labour rights violations facing migrant workers in three modern, urban work sectors-construction, hotels and manufacturing-spanning the high in-migration cities of Ahmedabad and Surat in Gujarat. It juxtaposes the exploitation of migrant workers with gaps in the country's labour governance architecture, to highlight that suspension of migrant workers' rights is the central feature of urban economic growth, maintained through extra-legal and informal processes in its labour markets. It addresses core tensions and deadlocks in the labour reforms process, to move towards a labour governance architecture that is able to respond to an intersection of challenges presented by informality, mobility and social marginalisation experienced by rural-urban migrants, for enabling inclusive and equitable urban growth.","Jayaram, Nivedita; Varma, Divya",Indian J Labour Econ,,150

Due to the scientific community's efforts, there is an increasing body of published studies describing the virus' biology, its transmission and diagnosis, its clinical features, its radiological findings, and the development of candidate therapeutics and vaccines. Despite the decline in postmortem examination rate, autopsy remains the gold standard to determine why and how death happens. Defining the pathophysiology of death is not only limited to forensic considerations; it may also provide useful clinical and epidemiologic insights. Selective approaches to postmortem diagnosis, such as limited postmortem sampling over full autopsy, can also be useful in the control of disease outbreaks and provide valuable knowledge for managing appropriate control measures. In this scenario, we strongly recommend performing full autopsies on patients who died with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities. Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality. Death can teach us not only about the disease, it might also help with its prevention and, above all, treatment.","Pomara, Cristoforo; Li Volti, Giovanni; Cappello, Francesco",,,150

The present study aimed to examine whether the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination changed in different COVID-19 epidemic phases in China. Two consecutive surveys were conducted among Chinese adults in March (n = 2058) (severe epidemic phase) and November-December (n = 2013) (well-contained phase, right before the COVID-19 vaccine was conditionally approved) 2020, and 791 respondents were longitudinally followed-up. The attitude, acceptance, and preferences for future COVID-19 vaccination were compared between two epidemic phases. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify influencing factors of acceptance. Among the 791 respondents longitudinally followed, 91.9% in March and 88.6% of them in November-December 2020 would like to get COVID-19 vaccination in China. In March 58.3% wished to get vaccinated immediately, but the proportion declined to 23.0% in November-December 2020, because more respondents wanted to delay vaccination until the vaccine's safety was confirmed. Similar results were found by comparing all respondents from the two cross-sectional surveys in different epidemic phases. The risk perception, attitude for the importance of vaccination against COVID-19, vaccination history, valuing doctor's recommendations, vaccination convenience, or vaccine price in decision-making had impacts on respondents' intention for immediate vaccination. The public acceptance for COVID-19 vaccination in China sustained at a high level in different COVID-19 epidemic phases. However, the intention of immediate vaccination declined substantially due to concerns about the vaccine's safety. Information about vaccination safety from authoritative sources, doctor's recommendations, and vaccination convenience were important in addressing vaccine hesitancy and promoting successful herd immunity for the general population in China.","Wang, Jiahao; Lu, Xinran; Lai, Xiaozhen; Lyu, Yun; Zhang, Haijun; Fenghuang, Yufei; Jing, Rize; Li, Li; Yu, Wenzhou; Fang, Hai",,,150

METHODS: Atahualpa residents aged &#8805;40 were eligible if they had a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) nine months before the pandemic and a lateral flow-based test for identification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the peak of the pandemic. Six months later, individuals completed a follow-up PSQI. The independent relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and deterioration in sleep quality was assessed by fitting logistic mixed models for longitudinal data. RESULTS: Of 639 participants (mean age at baseline: 59±12.8 years), 325 (51%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. A total of 185 (29%) individuals at baseline and 311 (49%) at follow-up were poor sleepers (p<0.001). Mixed logistic regression models demonstrated a significant increase in poor sleepers at follow-up (OR: 2.85; 95% C.I.: 2.16 - 3.75), which was more marked among SARS-CoV-2 seropositive subjects (OR: 3.8; 95% C.I.: 2.48 - 5.81). The adjusted proportion of poor sleepers increased from 29% to 56.2% (95% C.I.: 50.9 - 61.6%) among SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals, but only to 40.7% (95% C.I.: 35.3 - 46.1%) in their seronegative counterparts (p<0.001). Likewise, progression from a good to a poor sleeper status was higher among seropositive individuals than in their seronegative counterparts (38.1% versus 22.3%; p<0.001), after adjusting for relevant covariates. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a deleterious effect of SARS-CoV-2 in sleep quality.

462646,Enzymatic and Non-Enzymatic Molecules with Antioxidant Function,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 from exposure to endemic human coronaviruses (eHCoV) is gaining increasing attention as a possible driver of both protection against infection and COVID-19 severity. Here we explore the potential role of cross-reactivity induced by eHCoVs on age-specific COVID-19 severity in a mathematical model of eHCoV and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: We use an individual-based model, calibrated to prior knowledge of eHCoV dynamics, to fully track individual histories of exposure to eHCoVs. We also model the emergent dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of hospitalisation upon infection. RESULTS: We hypothesise that primary exposure with any eHCoV confers temporary cross-protection against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, while life-long re-exposure to the same eHCoV diminishes cross-protection, and increases the potential for disease severity. We show numerically that our proposed mechanism can explain age patterns of COVID-19 hospitalisation in EU/EEA countries and the UK. We further show that some of the observed variation in health care capacity and testing efforts is compatible with country-specific differences in hospitalisation rates under this model. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a ""proof of possibility"" for certain biological and epidemiological mechanisms that could potentially drive COVID-19-related variation across age groups. Our findings call for further research on the role of cross-reactivity to eHCoVs and highlight data interpretation challenges arising from health care capacity and SARS-CoV-2 testing.","Pinotti, Francesco; Wikramaratna, Paul S; Obolski, Uri; Paton, Robert S; Damineli, Daniel S C; Alcantara, Luiz C J; Giovanetti, Marta; Gupta, Sunetra; Lourenço, José",BMC Med,,150

Data regarding critically ill COVID-19 patients and their demand of critical care services outside of initial COVID-19 epicenters are lacking. This study described clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients and the capacity of a COVID-19-dedicated intensive care unit (ICU) in Kobe, Japan. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to a 14-bed COVID-19-dedicated ICU in Kobe between March 3, 2020 and June 21, 2020. Clinical and daily ICU occupancy data were obtained from electrical medical records. The last follow-up day was June 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of 32 patients included, the median hospital follow-up period was 27 (interquartile range 19-50) days. The median age was 68 (57-76) years; 23 (72%) were men and 25 (78%) had at least one comorbidity. Nineteen (59%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median duration of 14 (8-27) days. Until all patients were discharged from the ICU on June 5, 2020, the median daily ICU occupancy was 50% (36-71%). As of June 28, 2020, six (19%) died during hospitalization. Of 26 (81%) survivors, 23 (72%) were discharged from the hospital and three (9%) remained in the hospital.

METHODS: The epidemiological dataset of confirmed cases with COVID-19 in Japan as of February 28, 2020 was analyzed. A statistical model was constructed to describe the heterogeneity of the reporting rate by age and severity. We estimated the number of severe and non-severe cases, accounting for under-ascertainment. RESULTS: The ascertainment rate of non-severe cases was estimated at 0.44 (95% confidence interval 0.37-0.50), indicating that the unbiased number of non-severe cases would be more than twice the reported count. CONCLUSIONS: Severe cases are twice as likely to be diagnosed and reported when compared to other cases. Considering that reported cases are usually dominated by non-severe cases, the adjusted total number of cases is also approximately double the observed count. This finding is critical in interpreting the reported data, and it is advised that the mild case data for COVID-19 should always be interpreted as under-ascertained [Au?1].","Omori, Ryosuke; Mizumoto, Kenji; Nishiura, Hiroshi",Int J Infect Dis,,150

We performed a Phase IIa double-blind, randomized controlled trial to compare HDIVZn to placebo in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We administered trial treatment per day for a maximum of 7 days until either death or hospital discharge. We measured zinc concentration at baseline and during treatment and observed patients for any significant side effects. For eligible patients, we randomized and administered treatment to 33 adult participants to either HDIVZn (n = 15) or placebo (n = 18). We observed no serious adverse events throughout the study for a total of 94 HDIVZn administrations. However, three participants in the HDIVZn group reported infusion site irritation. Mean serum zinc on Day 1 in the placebo, and the HDIVZn group was 6.9 ± 1.1 and 7.7 ± 1.6 µmol/l, respectively, consistent with zinc deficiency. HDIVZn, but not placebo, increased serum zinc levels above the deficiency cutoff of 10.7 µmol/l (p < .001) on Day 6. Our study did not reach its target enrollment because stringent public health measures markedly reduced patient hospitalizations. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients demonstrated zinc deficiency. This can be corrected with HDIVZn. Such treatment appears safe, feasible, and only associated with minimal peripheral infusion site irritation.

O sistema renina-angiotensina-aldosterona (SRAA) influencia diretamente o desenvolvimento da hipertensão arterial sistêmica (HAS) e proteinúria em pacientes com doença renal crônica (DRC). Sendo assim, o objetivo deste projeto foi avaliar a atividade do SRAA, por meio da concentração plasmática de aldosterona ([aldo]p) e atividade plasmática da renina (APR), em cães hígidos e com DRC de ocorrência natural, procurando associar tais parâmetros com a condição clínica e a evolução da doença nos cães com DRC. Os cães foram avaliados por exame físico e exames laboratoriais. A [aldo]p e a APR foram determinadas por radioimunoensaio. Os cães do grupo DRC apresentaram manifestações clínicas condizentes com uremia, além de anemia, azotemia, baixa densidade urinária, proteinúria e hipocalcemia, em comparação ao grupo controle (p<0,05). No grupo DRC, observou-se ainda a hiperfosfatemia. Não houve diferença entre os grupos em relação ao valor médio da pressão arterial sistólica (PAS); contudo, a hipertensão foi observada em 23% dos cães com DRC. Os grupos também não diferiram quanto aos valores médios da [aldo]p, APR e relação [aldo]p:APR, mas, individualmente, verificou-se valores mais elevados para [aldo]p e a supressão da APR em cães do grupo DRC. A proteinúria foi o achado mais comum no grupo DRC, além disso, a análise de correlação indicou que a elevação da PAS e da [aldo]p podem contribuir com a proteinúria em cães. Os cães do grupo DRC apresentaram manifestações condizentes com a estimulação do SRAA, mas que não foram evidenciadas por alterações na [aldo]p, APR e relação [aldo]p:APR.

We aimed to explore the changes in ECG parameters after treatment with triple combination therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center case series analyzed 91 patients with mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19 at Ankara Gazi Mus-tafa Kemal State Hospital of Ankara City, Turkey, from April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. Forty-three patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine+oseltamivir+azithromycin (Group 1) and 48 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine+oseltamivir+levofloxacin (Group 2). Heart rate, P wave duration, P wave dispersion, PR interval, QRS duration, corrected QT interval (QTc), QTc dispersion (QTD), delta QTc, Tp-e, Tp-e dispersion, and Tp-e/QTc ratio were all calculated from the baseline and posttreatment 12-lead ECG recordings. RESULTS: The QTc, QRS duration, Tp-e, PR interval, and P wave duration were significantly increased after treatment (p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001; p=0.001; p=0.001). The posttreatment C-reactive protein level was significantly lower than at baseline in Group 1 (p=0.014). At admission, 30% of patients had QT prolongation, and 4.3% of them had a QT duration >500 ms. Both Group 1 and Group 2 showed significant prolongation of the QTc interval (Group 1; p<0.001 vs. Group 2; p<0.001), QRS duration (Group 1; p=0.006 vs. Group 2; p=0.014), Tp-e (Group 1; p=0.036 vs. Group 2; p<0.001), and PR interval (Group 1; p=0.002 vs. Group2; p=0.05). The QTD was significantly decreased in Group 1 (p<0.001). None of the patients experienced any overt ventricular arrhythmia. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate QT prolongation in a population of COVID-19 patients treated with triple combination therapy. We found that there was a significant decrease in the QTD after the treatment in patients who were taking triple therapy including azithromycin.","Ugurlu Ilgin, Burcu; Akbulut Koyuncu, Irem Müge; Kiziltunç, Emrullah",Anatol J Cardiol,,150

METHODS: We reviewed the cancer tracking database of the largest cancer center in southern Brasil and performed statistical tests to compare first-time appointments from the onset of the outbreak until the end of June to those of the equivalent period in 2019. RESULTS: We observed a dramatic reduction (-42%) in first-time appointments during the pandemic compared to the same period in the previous year (P <0.001). This reduction was observed among all medical specialties (P <0.001). CONCLUSION: The onset of COVID-19 was correlated with a reduction in admission to a high-complexity cancer care center in Brasil. Since a delay in diagnosis and treatment may influence prognosis, it is important that cancer centers and public health strategies reinforce care for non-COVID-19 patients to prevent potentially unnecessary deaths.","Nabhen, Jacqueline Justino; Ostroski, Tayza Katelline Danilau; Kozonoe, Milena Massumi; Orlandi, Dinarte; Tormen, Tiago; Ioshii, Sérgio Ossamu",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),,150

Vaccination is a critical part of controlling community spread, but vaccine acceptance has varied, with some research reporting that Black individuals in the US are less willing to be vaccinated than other racial/ethnic groups. Medical mistrust informed by experiences of racism may be associated with this lower willingness. Objective: To examine the association between race/ethnicity and rejection of COVID-19 vaccine trial participation and vaccine uptake and to investigate whether racial/ethnic group-based medical mistrust is a potential mediator of this association. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional survey study was conducted from June to December 2020 using a convenience sample of 1835 adults aged 18 years or older residing in Michigan. Participants were recruited through community-based organizations and hospital-academic networks.

Participants also completed the suspicion subscale of the Group-Based Medical Mistrust Scale. Results: Of the 1835 participants, 1455 (79%) were women, 361 (20%) men, and 19 (1%) other gender. The mean (SD) age was 49.4 (17.9) years, and 394 participants (21%) identified as Black individuals. Overall, 1376 participants (75%) reported low willingness to participate in vaccine trials, and 945 (52%) reported low willingness to be vaccinated. Black participants reported the highest medical mistrust scores (mean [SD], 2.35 [0.96]) compared with other racial/ethnic groups (mean [SD] for the total sample, 1.83 [0.91]). Analysis of path models revealed significantly greater vaccine trial and vaccine uptake rejection among Black participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], 0.51 [0.08]; vaccine uptake: B [SE], 0.51 [0.08]; both P < .001) compared with the overall mean rejection. The association was partially mediated by medical mistrust among Black participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], 0.04 [0.01]; P = .003; vaccine uptake: B [SE], 0.07 [0.02]; P < .001) and White participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], -0.06 [0.02]; P = .001; vaccine uptake: B [SE], -0.10 [0.02]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of US adults, racial/ethnic group-based medical mistrust partially mediated the association between individuals identifying as Black and low rates of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine trial participation and actual vaccination. The findings suggest that partnerships between health care and other sectors to build trust and promote vaccination may benefit from socially and culturally responsive strategies that acknowledge and address racial/ethnic health care disparities and historical and contemporary experiences of racism.","Thompson, Hayley S; Manning, Mark; Mitchell, Jamie; Kim, Seongho; Harper, Felicity W K; Cresswell, Sheena; Johns, Kristopher; Pal, Shoma; Dowe, Brittany; Tariq, Madiha; Sayed, Nadia; Saigh, Lisa M; Rutledge, Lisa; Lipscomb, Curtis; Lilly, Jametta Y; Gustine, Heidi; Sanders, Annie; Landry, Megan; Marks, Bertram",JAMA Netw Open,,150

Recent studies indicate that a hyperinflammatory syndrome induced by SARS-CoV-2 contributes to disease severity and mortality in COVID-19. In this review, an overview of the pathophysiology underlying the hyperinflammatory syndrome in severe COVID-19 is provided. The current evidence suggests that the hyperinflammatory syndrome results from a dysregulated host innate immune response. The gross and microscopic pathologic findings as well as the alterations in the cytokine milieu, macrophages/monocytes, natural killer cells, T cells, and neutrophils in severe COVID-19 are summarized.

Current recommendations for healthy food to complement breastfeeding at age 6 to 23 months include iron-rich and iron-enriched foods. An electronic nutrient analysis was undertaken to assess the iron content of hypothetical healthy diets for breastfed babies and young children aged 6 to 23 months in Australia, in comparison with their estimated requirements. METHODS: Hypothetical diets for 1 day were developed that were consistent with the Foundation Diets for breastfed infants 6 to 12 months and for toddlers 13 to 23 months. Nutrient content was derived using the Australian Food Composition database in FoodWorks 10. The iron content of these two diets were compared with Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Intakes (RDIs) for iron for infants aged 7 to 12 months and children aged 1 to 3 years. RESULTS: The iron content of the hypothetical diet for breastfed infants aged 6 to 12 months (5.8 mg) was less than the EAR (7 mg, 83%) and the RDI (11 mg, 53%). For young breastfed children aged 13 to 23 months, the iron content of the hypothetical diet was 4.4 mg; above the EAR (4 mg, 110%) but less than RDI (9 mg, 49%). CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding has health and neurodevelopmental benefits for infants and young children that are particularly important in remote Australia where food insecurity and poor nutrition compromise health and wellbeing. Adequate iron intake is also important for neurodevelopment in early life but healthy diets for breastfed babies and young children may have insufficient iron content to meet requirements. The upcoming revision of the Australian Dietary Guidelines provides an opportunity to consider this issue.","Leonard, Dympna; Buettner, Petra; McDermott, Robyn; Makrides, Maria",Nutr. diet,,150

489092,Trying out personalized therapy in NSCLC,2020,"Objective: To investigate the association of voice analysis with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients and methods: A vocal biomarker, a unitless scalar with a value between 0-1, was developed based on 434 voice samples. The biomarker training was followed by a prospective, multi-center, observational study. All subjects were tested for SARS-CoV-2, had their voice recorded to a smartphone application and gave their informed consent to participate in the study. The association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the vocal biomarker was evaluated. Results: Final study population included 80 subjects with a median age of 29 [23-36], of whom 68% were men. Forty patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Infected patients were 12 times more likely to report at least one symptom (odds ratio 11.8, p<.001). The vocal biomarker was significantly higher among infected patients (0.11 [0.06-0.17] vs. 0.19 [0.12-0.3], p=.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) evaluating the association of the vocal biomarker with SARS-CoV-2 status was 72%. With a biomarker threshold of 0.115, the results translated to a sensitivity and specificity of 85% [95% CI: 70-94%] and 53% [95% CI: 36-69%], respectively. When added to a self-reported symptom classifier, the AUC significantly improved from 0.775 to 0.85. Conclusion: Voice analysis is associated with SARS-CoV-2 status and holds the potential to improve the accuracy of self-reported symptom-based screening tools. This pilot study suggests a possible role for vocal biomarkers in screening for SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects.","Maor, Elad; Tsur, Nir; Barkai, Galia; Meister, Ido; Makmel, Shmuel; Friedman, Eli; Aronovich, Daniel; Mevorach, Dana; Lerman, Amir; Zimlichman, Eyal; Bachar, Gideon",,,150

We evaluated the activity of the Emergency Department (ED) during the national lockdown (March 8-April 30), as well as the outcomes of our infection control strategy. RESULTS: Despite a reduction in access by one fifth, a proportion of febrile patients comparable to 2019 was seen (829/2492, 33.3% vs 4580/13.342, 34.3%, p = 0.3). Diagnostic swab for COVID-19 was performed in 25% of patients, especially in subjects with co-morbidities or multiple access. Six infected cases were identified, all presenting with febrile disease. Only two positive patients fulfilled the criteria for diagnostic swab provided by the Italian Health Authorities, because of close contact with suspected or confirmed cases. The rate of admission for febrile or respiratory conditions was higher than the same period of 2019 (33.4% vs 25.9%, p < 0.0001). None of the 105 health-care professionals working during the study time lapse exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion. Among the 589 patients with information available, 54.9% declared no medical consultation at all prior to coming to ED, while only 40 (of which 27 with fever) had been examined by their GP before coming to ED. Nevertheless, 35.6% of the cases were already taking medications. None of the 9 patients requiring intensive care reported recent pediatric consultation, despite symptoms duration up to 30 days. CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that the reduced capacity of primary care facilities during the national lockdown may have caused a high rate of self-medication as well as a delayed provision of care in some patients. Identification of pediatric patients affected with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains a challenge because of the absence of reliable predictive factors. Finally, the use of specific triage centers, with dedicated pathways to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection, trace contacts and allow adequate care after swabs, is effective in preventing spreading of the infection.","Mauro, Angela; Improda, Nicola; Zenzeri, Letizia; Valitutti, Francesco; Vecchione, Erica; Esposito, Sara; Tipo, Vincenzo",Ital J Pediatr,,150

As of March 26, 2020, there are more than 500,000 cases and more than 25,000 deaths related to COVID-19, and the numbers are increasing by the hour. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the trends in confirmed COVID-19 cases in North Carolina, and to understand patterns in virtual visits related to symptoms of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of confirmed COVID-19 cases and patients using an on-demand, statewide virtual urgent care center. We collected data from February 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020. Institutional Review Board exemption was obtained prior to the study. RESULTS: As of March, 18 2020, there were 92 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 733 total virtual visits. Of the total visits, 257 (35.1%) were related to COVID-19-like symptoms. Of the COVID-19-like visits, the number of females was 178 (69.2%). People in the age groups of 30-39 years (n=67, 26.1%) and 40-49 years (n=64, 24.9%) were half of the total patients. Additionally, approximately 96.9% (n=249) of the COVID-like encounters came from within the state of North Carolina. Our study shows that virtual care can provide efficient triaging in the counties with the highest number of COVID-19 cases. We also confirmed that the largest spread of the disease occurs in areas with a high population density as well as in areas with major airports. CONCLUSIONS: The use of virtual care presents promising potential in the fight against COVID-19. Virtual care is capable of reducing emergency room visits, conserving health care resources, and avoiding the spread of COVID-19 by treating patients remotely. We call for further adoption of virtual care by health systems across the United States and the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Khairat, Saif; Meng, Chenlu; Xu, Yuxuan; Edson, Barbara; Gianforcaro, Robert",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,150

496167,Photocatalysis for Air Treatment Processes: Current Technologies and Future Applications for the Removal of Organic Pollutants and Viruses,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), now named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may change the risk of stroke through an enhanced systemic inflammatory response, hypercoagulable state, and endothelial damage in the cerebrovascular system. Moreover, due to the current pandemic, some countries have prioritized health resources towards COVID-19 management, making it more challenging to appropriately care for other potentially disabling and fatal diseases such as stroke. The aim of this study is to identify and describe changes in stroke epidemiological trends before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is an international, multicenter, hospital-based study on stroke incidence and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will describe patterns in stroke management, stroke hospitalization rate, and stroke severity, subtype (ischemic/hemorrhagic), and outcomes (including in-hospital mortality) in 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with the corresponding data from 2018 and 2019, and subsequently 2021. We will also use an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to assess the change in stroke hospitalization rates before, during, and after COVID-19, in each participating center. CONCLUSION: The proposed study will potentially enable us to better understand the changes in stroke care protocols, differential hospitalization rate, and severity of stroke, as it pertains to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, this will help guide clinical-based policies surrounding COVID-19 and other similar global pandemics to ensure that management of cerebrovascular comorbidity is appropriately prioritized during the global crisis.

However, it is still poorly understood how animals can cope with and adapt to these rapid and dramatic transformations of natural environments. The COVID-19 pandemic provides us with a unique opportunity to unveil the mechanisms involved in this process. Lockdown measures imposed in most countries are causing an unprecedented reduction of human activities, giving us an experimental setting to assess the effects of our lifestyle on biodiversity. We studied the birds' response to the population lockdown by using more than 126 000 bird records collected by a citizen science project in northeastern Spain. We compared the occurrence and detectability of birds during the spring 2020 lockdown with baseline data from previous years in the same urban areas and dates. We found that birds did not increase their probability of occurrence in urban areas during the lockdown, refuting the hypothesis that nature has recovered its space in human-emptied urban areas. However, we found an increase in bird detectability, especially during early morning, suggesting a rapid change in the birds' daily routines in response to quieter and less crowded cities. Therefore, urban birds show high behavioural plasticity to rapidly adjust to novel environmental conditions, such as those imposed by the COVID-19.","Gordo, Oscar; Brotons, Lluís; Herrando, Sergi; Gargallo, Gabriel",Proc Biol Sci,,150

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicentric descriptive study, surveys were distributed among 4 different Breast Cancer Centers (BCC). BCCs were distinguished according to COVID-19 tertiary care hospital (COVID/No-COVID) and district prevalence (DP) (High vs. Low). DASS-21 score, PSS score and demographic data (age, sex, work) were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 51 HCWs were analyzed in the study. Age, work and sex did not demonstrate statistically significant values. Statistically significant distribution was found between DASS-21-stress score and COVID/No-COVID (p=0.043). No difference was found in the remaining DASS-21 and PSS scores, dividing the HCWs according to COVID-19-hospital and DP. CONCLUSION: Working in a COVID-19-hospital represents a factor that negatively affects psychosocial well-being. However, DP seems not to affect the psychosocial well-being of BCC HCWs.

498410,Contribution of Bioactive Compounds to the Antioxidant Capacity of the Edible Mushroom Neolentinus lepideus,2021,"BACKGROUND: Mexican state governments' actions are essential to control the COVID-19 pandemic within the country. However, the type, rigor and pace of implementation of public policies have varied considerably between states. Little is known about the subnational (state) variation policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We collected daily information on public policies designed to inform the public, as well as to promote distancing, and mask use. The policies analyzed were: School Closure, Workplace Closure, Cancellation of Public Events, Restrictions on Gatherings, Stay at Home Order, Public Transit Suspensions, Information Campaigns, Internal Travel Controls, International Travel Controls, Use of Face Masks We use these data to create a composite index to evaluate the adoption of these policies in the 32 states. We then assess the timeliness and rigor of the policies across the country, from the date of the first case, February 27, 2020. RESULTS: The national average in the index during the 143 days of the pandemic was 41.1 out of a possible 100 points on our index. Nuevo León achieved the highest performance (50.4); San Luis Potosí the lowest (34.1). The differential between the highest versus the lowest performance was 47.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The study identifies variability and heterogeneity in how and when Mexican states implemented policies to contain COVID-19. We demonstrate the absence of a uniform national response and widely varying stringency of state responses. We also show how these responses are not based on testing and do not reflect the local burden of disease. National health system stewardship and a coordinated, timely, rigorous response to the pandemic did not occur in Mexico but is desirable to contain COVID-19.","Knaul, Felicia; Arreola-Ornelas, Héctor; Porteny, Thalia; Touchton, Michael; Sánchez-Talanquer, Mariano; Méndez, Óscar; Chertorivski, Salomón; Ortega, Sonia; Chudnovsky, Mariana; Kuri, Pablo",PLoS One,,150

502862,Nano-microparticle platforms in developing next-generation vaccines,2021,"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic hit the United States in March 2020, there was widespread disruption of clinical medical education: Hospital clerkships were suspended nationwide and students were moved out of the hospital and continued their studies remotely through virtual learning systems. Frustrated by not being able to directly care for patients, medical students across the country formed diverse volunteer initiatives to help frontline clinicians. In this article, the authors describe the essential role of medical students at Weill Cornell Medicine in quickly designing and building a large registry of COVID-19 patients who presented at 3 New York City hospitals. The Cornell COVID-19 Registry, which contains granular clinical information on more than 4,000 patients, informed hospital operations and guided clinical management during the first wave of the pandemic. One month after its creation, the registry led to the first published description of the clinical characteristics of a U.S.-based cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Using their experience as a model, the authors propose that students who cannot participate in their clinical clerkships because of the pandemic can augment their traditional medical education by contributing to COVID-19 research. In the case described in this article, students reviewed the management of COVID-19 patients, followed inpatients throughout their hospitalization (much like students would on clinical rotations), and refined their interpersonal skills through discussions with patients and patients' families during follow-up calls. The authors conclude that medical students who are displaced from their hospital rotations can further their education and provide an invaluable contribution to the fight against COVID-19 by serving as essential frontline researchers.","Alshak, Mark N; Li, Han A; Wehmeyer, Graham T",Acad Med,,150

Four of these species, namely, HCoV 229E, HCoV NL63, HCoV HKU1, and HCoV OC43, typically cause mild upper respiratory infection in babies, kids, and the elderly. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2 lead to more serious diseases in humans by infecting the lower respiratory tract. Epidemic and pandemic situations are the consequences of the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and large number of deaths. Evaluations related to the recent COVID-19 pandemic have revealed some requirements, which are not well known but essential for fighting against this disease. These requirements include the obligation to work at laboratories with high biosafety level (BSL) and conduction of studies under the guidance of biosafety and biosecurity simultaneously. Likewise, to overcome the hazardous microorganisms, laboratory research is required alongside therapeutic and diagnostic services in the field. This article aims to explain biosafety and biosecurity practices at BSL-3 laboratories, which are necessary for the studies of SARS-CoV-2 as the causative agent of COVID-19.","Karagul, M.

An on-going coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a challenge all over the world. Since an endoscopy unit and its staff are at potentially high risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we conducted a survey for the management of the gastrointestinal endoscopic practice, personal protective equipment (PPE), and risk assessment for COVID-19 during the pandemic at multiple facilities.Methods. The 11-item survey questionnaire was sent to representative respondent of Department of Gastroenterology, Osaka City University Hospital, and its 19 related facilities.Results. A total of 18 facilities submitted valid responses and a total of 373 health care professionals (HCPs) participated. All facilities (18/18: 100%) were screening patients at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection before endoscopy. During the pandemic, we found that the total volume of endoscopic procedures decreased by 44%. Eleven facilities (11/18: 61%) followed recommendations of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society (JGES); consequently, about 35%-50% of esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were canceled. Mask (surgical mask or N95 mask), face shield/goggle, gloves (one or two sets), and gown (with long or short sleeves) were being used by endoscopists, nurses, endoscopy technicians, and endoscope cleaning staff in all the facilities (18/18: 100%). SARS-CoV-2 infection risk assessment of HCPs was conducted daily in all the facilities (18/18: 100%), resulting in no subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCPs.Conclusion. COVID-19 has had a dramatic impact on the gastrointestinal endoscopic practice. The recommendations of the JGES were appropriate as preventive measures for the SARSCoV-2 infection in the endoscopy unit and its staff.","Maruyama, Hirotsugu; Hosomi, Shuhei; Nebiki, Hiroko; Fukuda, Takashi; Nakagawa, Koichiro; Okazaki, Hirotoshi; Yamagami, Hirokazu; Hara, Junichi; Tanigawa, Tetsuya; Machida, Hirohisa; Aomatsu, Kazuki; Watanabe, Yoshihisa; Sato, Hiroshi; Uno, Hironori; Takaishi, Osamu; Nomura, Tsutomu; Ochi, Masahiro; Oshitani, Nobuhide; Adachi, Kenji; Higashimori, Akira; Ominami, Masaki; Nadatani, Yuji; Fukunaga, Shusei; Otani, Koji; Tanaka, Fumio; Kamata, Noriko; Nagami, Yasuaki; Taira, Koichi; Watanabe, Toshio; Fujiwara, Yasuhiro",Rom J Intern Med,,150

It is urgent to exert adequate efforts for the management of dialysis patients, caregivers, and healthcare personnel (HCP). This study aimed at reporting practical workflow, identification of high-risk or suspected cases of CO-VID-19, and subsequent response measures. METHODS: At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, precautions and practice protocols were applied in our dialysis units (DUs). This single-center study retrospectively reviewed all high-risk/suspected cases from January 23, 2020, to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical feature, and detailed data on all cases were recorded. RESULTS: Practical workflow for the clinical management of dialysis patients, caregivers, and HCP was initiated. A total of 6 high-risk/suspected cases were identified. Female gender, older age, presence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, anuresis, immunocompromised status, hypoalbuminemia, and underweight were noticeable features in these cases. Direct evidence of infection or epidemiological risk was detected in five cases. Close monitoring for temperature and oxygen saturation during hemodialysis sessions may be reasonable. No confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in our DU, but certain cases showed rapid deterioration due to other critically severe condition needing hospitalization. Portable dialysis machines are of great need to ensure dialysis care provision. CONCLUSIONS: Our study described a practical workflow for patient-centered management during COVID-19 outbreak. Potential risk factors and underlying clinical patterns were reported. Further studies regarding the efficacy of infection control precautions and practice protocols tailored for dialysis settings are warranted.","Hu, Shou-Ci; Fu, En-Qing; Fan, Jun-Fen; Ye, Qing-Qing; Xia, Cong; Gan, Tie-Er; Ma, Hong-Zhen",Blood Purif,,150

Its clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 under mechanical ventilation remains to be evaluated. METHODS: This study includes patients under mechanical ventilation with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the ICU of Pesaro hospital between 29 February and 20 March 2020. During this period, remdesivir was provided on a compassionate use basis. Clinical characteristics and outcome of patients treated with remdesivir were collected retrospectively and compared with those of patients hospitalized in the same time period. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients were considered, of which 25 were treated with remdesivir. The median (IQR) age was 67 (59-75.5) years, 92% were men and symptom onset was 10 (8-12) days before admission to ICU. At baseline, there was no significant difference in demographic characteristics, comorbidities and laboratory values between patients treated and not treated with remdesivir. Median follow-up was 52 (46-57) days. Kaplan-Meier curves showed significantly lower mortality among patients who had been treated with remdesivir (56% versus 92%, P < 0.001). Cox regression analysis showed that the Charlson Comorbidity Index was the only factor that had a significant association with higher mortality (OR 1.184; 95% CI 1.027-1.365; P = 0.020), while the use of remdesivir was associated with better survival (OR 3.506; 95% CI 1.768-6.954; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this study the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 under mechanical ventilation is confirmed to be high. The use of remdesivir was associated with a significant beneficial effect on survival.","Pasquini, Zeno; Montalti, Roberto; Temperoni, Chiara; Canovari, Benedetta; Mancini, Mauro; Tempesta, Michele; Pimpini, Daniela; Zallocco, Nicoletta; Barchiesi, Francesco",J Antimicrob Chemother,,150

For contact tracing to be effective, those with symptoms must self-report themselves while their contacts must self-isolate when asked. However, policies such as legal enforcement of self-isolation can create trade-offs by dissuading individuals from self-reporting. We use an existing branching process model to examine which aspects of contact tracing adherence should be prioritized. We consider an inverse relationship between self-isolation adherence and self-reporting engagement, assuming that increasingly strict self-isolation policies will result in fewer individuals self-reporting to the programme. We find that policies which increase the average duration of self-isolation, or that increase the probability that people self-isolate at all, at the expense of reduced self-reporting rate, will not decrease the risk of a large outbreak and may increase the risk, depending on the strength of the trade-off. These results suggest that policies to increase self-isolation adherence should be implemented carefully. Policies that increase self-isolation adherence at the cost of self-reporting rates should be avoided.

515334,Training in endoscopic ear surgery using the papaya petiole,2021,"The main-protease (Mpro) catalyzes a crucial step for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. The recent SARS-CoV-2 presents the main protease (MCoV2pro) with 12 mutations compared to SARS-CoV (MCoV1pro). Recent studies point out that these subtle differences lead to mobility variances at the active site loops with functional implications. We use metadynamics simulations and a sort of computational analysis to probe the dynamic, pharmacophoric and catalytic environment differences between the monomers of both enzymes. So, we verify how much intrinsic distinctions are preserved in the functional dimer of MCoV2pro, as well as its implications for ligand accessibility and optimized drug screening. We find a significantly higher accessibility to open binding conformers in the MCoV2pro monomer compared to MCoV1pro. A higher hydration propensity for the MCoV2pro S2 loop with the A46S substitution seems to exercise a key role. Quantum calculations suggest that the wider conformations for MCoV2pro are less catalytically active in the monomer. However, the statistics for contacts involving the N-finger suggest higher maintenance of this activity at the dimer. Docking analyses suggest that the ability to vary the active site width can be important to improve the access of the ligand to the active site in different ways. So, we carry out a multiconformational virtual screening with different ligand bases. The results point to the importance of taking into account the protein conformational multiplicity for new promissors anti MCoV2pro ligands. We hope these results will be useful in prospecting, repurposing and/or designing new anti SARS-CoV-2 drugs.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AIMS: The present study sought to examine the perceived impact of social lockdown on sexual fantasy and solitary sexual behavior among UK young adults in various living situations. METHODS: A convenience sample of 565 adults aged 18-32 and living in the UK completed anonymous, web-based, study-specific questionnaires between May 14 and 18, 2020, 7 weeks after social lockdown was initiated. Mixed-method analyses were conducted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study presents qualitative and quantitative data. Criterion variables were measured dichotomously as increases (vs no change) in sexual fantasy and increases (vs no change) in pornography consumption. Predictor variables were living arrangement, relationship status, and postlockdown changes in masturbation and pornography consumption. RESULTS: Of all, 34.3% engaged in more sexual fantasizing during lockdown; women were more likely than men to report this increase. Living context and relationship status were predictors of increased fantasizing. Of all, 30.44% reported an increase in at least one solitary sexual practice. This increase was associated with an increase in sexual fantasizing and also with increased pornography consumption. Nineteen percent of participants reported an increase in pornography use, with men being more likely than women to report this increase. Participants mostly attributed their increases to boredom, increased free time, and replacing partnered sex. CONCLUSION: Shifts in sexual fantasizing and solitary sexual practices were predicted by living arrangements, relationship status, and gender. The present findings suggest that the assessment of sexual fantasy and solitary sexual activities may benefit patients presenting with pandemic-related stress. Although mostly exploratory, significant changes in sexual fantasy and solitary sexual practices were observed. A cross-sectional design, convenience sampling, and study-specific measures are limitations. Cascalheira CJ, McCormack M, Portch E, et al.

523524,Comparative Analysis of the Results of Coronavirus Imaging on PEM and SPM,2020,"BACKGROUND: Marked geographical disparities in survival from colon cancer have been consistently described in England. Similar patterns have been observed within London, almost mimicking a microcosm of the country's survival patterns. This evidence has suggested that the area of residence plays an important role in the survival from cancer. METHODS: We analysed the survival from colon cancer of patients diagnosed in 2006-2013, in a pre-pandemic period, living in London at their diagnosis and received care in a London hospital. We examined the patterns of patient pathways between the area of residence and the hospital of care using flow maps, and we investigated whether geographical variations in survival from colon cancer are associated with the hospital of care. To estimate survival, we applied a Bayesian excess hazard model which accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data. RESULTS: Geographical disparities in colon cancer survival disappeared once controlled for hospitals, and the disparities seemed to be augmented between hospitals. However, close examination of patient pathways revealed that the poorer survival observed in some hospitals was mostly associated with higher proportions of emergency diagnosis, while their performance was generally as expected for patients diagnosed through non-emergency routes. DISCUSSION: This study highlights the need to better coordinate primary and secondary care sectors in some areas of London to improve timely access to specialised clinicians and diagnostic tests. This challenge remains crucially relevant after the recent successive regroupings of Clinical Commissioning Groups (which grouped struggling areas together) and the observed exacerbation of disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Quaresma, Manuela; Carpenter, James R; Turculet, Adrian; Rachet, Bernard",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,150
523827,Immune memory: an evolutionary perspective,2021,"Background: Emergency Departments (EDs) can serve as surveillance sites for infectious diseases. Our purpose was to determine the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevalence of vaccination against COVID-19 among patients attending an urban ED in Baltimore City. Methods: Using 1914 samples of known exposure status, we developed an algorithm to differentiate previously infected, vaccinated, and unexposed individuals using a combination of antibody assays. We applied this testing algorithm to 4360 samples ED patients obtained in the springs of 2020 and 2021. Using multinomial logistic regression, we determined factors associated with infection and vaccination. Results: For the algorithm, sensitivity and specificity for identifying vaccinated individuals was 100% and 99%, respectively, and 84% and 100% for naturally infected individuals. Among the ED subjects, seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 increased from 2% to 24% between April 2020 and March 2021. Vaccination prevalence rose to 11% by mid-March 2021. Marked differences in burden of disease and vaccination coverage were seen by sex, race, and ethnicity. Hispanic patients, though 7% of the study population, had the highest relative burden of disease (16 % of total infections) but similar vaccination rates. Women and White individuals were more likely to be vaccinated than men or Black individuals (adjusted odds ratios aOR 1.35 [95% CI: 1.02, 1.80] and aOR 2.26 [95% CI: 1.67, 3.07], respectively).

590441,Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System,2018-11-23,"BACKGROUND: A considerable proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. Therefore, different polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or rapid antigen test (RAT)-based approaches are being discussed and applied to identify infectious individuals that would have otherwise gone undetected. In this article, we provide a framework to estimate the time-dependent risk of being infectious after a negative SARS-CoV-2 test, and we simulate the number of expected infectious individuals over time in populations who initially tested negative. METHODS: A Monte Carlo approach is used to simulate asymptomatic infections over a 10-days period in populations of 1000 individuals following a negative SARS-CoV-2 test. Parameters representing the application of PCR tests or RATs are utilized, and SARS-CoV-2 cumulative 7-day incidences between 25 and 200 per 100,000 people are considered. Simulation results are compared to case numbers predicted via a mathematical equation. RESULTS: The simulations showed a continuous increase in infectious individuals over time in populations of individuals who initially tested SARS-CoV-2 negative. The interplay between false negative rates of PCR tests or RATs, and the time that has passed since testing determines the number of infectious individuals. The simulated and the mathematically predicted number of infectious individuals were comparable. However, Monte Carlo simulations highlight that, due to random variation, theoretically observed infectious individuals can considerably exceed predicted case numbers even shortly after a test was conducted. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the number of infectious individuals in a screened group of asymptomatic people can be effectively reduced, and this effect can be described mathematically. However, the false negative rate of a test, the time since the negative test and the underlying SARS-CoV-2 incidence are critical parameters in determining the observed subsequent number of cases in tested population groups.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the attitudes of National TB Programme (NTP) managers related to ACF policy development, implementation and scale-up in the 30 high-burden countries, and to review national TB strategic plans. METHODS: This was a mixed-methods study with an embedded design: A cross-sectional survey with NTP managers yielded quantitative and qualitative data. A review of national TB strategic plans complemented the results. All data were analyzed in parallel and merged in the interpretation of the findings. RESULTS: 23 of the 30 NTP managers (77%) participated in the survey and 22 (73%) national TB strategic plans were reviewed. NTP managers considered managers in districts and regions key stakeholders for both ACF policy development and implementation. Different types of evidence were used to inform ACF policy, while there was a particular demand for local evidence. The NSPs reflected the NTP managers’ unanimous agreement on the need for ACF scale-up, but not all included explicit aims and targets related to ACF. The NTP managers recognized that ACF may decrease health systems costs in the long-term, while acknowledging the risk for increased health system costs in the short-term. About 90% of the NTP managers declared that financial and human resources were currently lacking, while they also elaborated on strategies to overcome resource constraints. CONCLUSION: NTP managers stated that ACF should be scaled up but reported resource constraints. Strategies to increase resources exist but may not yet have been fully implemented, e.g. generating local evidence including from operational research for advocacy. Managers in districts and regions were identified as key stakeholders whose involvement could help improve ACF policy development, implementation and scale-up.","Biermann, Olivia; Tran, Phuong Bich; Viney, Kerri; Caws, Maxine; Lönnroth, Knut; Sidney Annerstedt, Kristi",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33112890/,150

Since SUD patients represent a population at a higher risk for complications from COVID-19, an alternative strategy to support COVID-19 testing was urgently needed. We designed and deployed a telehealth-based solution in which patients could use mobile devices to connect with trained collection professionals to perform observed urine collections, often referred to a UA (urinalysis). The solution was designed with patient-centered best practices for telehealth, stigma prevention, trauma-informed, empathy and compassion, and to remove barriers to access to care. This approach demonstrated high patient satisfaction scores thereby proving that it is possible to provide urine collection services in the patient’s home via a telehealth technology, while still upholding SUD testing integrity best practices.

Fever is defined as body temperature ≥ 37.5 °C and is a normal physiological response to illness that facilitates and accelerates recovery. Although it is often associated with self-limiting illness, it causes significant concern to both parents and attending healthcare workers. Clinical signs may be used by pharmacy staff and primary healthcare workers to determine level of distress and to distinguish between a child with fever who is at high risk of serious illness and who requires specific treatment, hospitalisation or specialist care, and those at low risk who could be managed conservatively at home. In children with warning signs, serious causes of fever that may need to be excluded include infections (including malaria), non-infective inflammatory conditions and malignancy. Simple febrile convulsions are not in themselves harmful, and are not necessarily indicative of serious infection. In the absence of illness requiring specific treatment, relief from distress is the primary indication for prescribing pharmacotherapy, and antipyretics should not be administered with the sole intention of reducing body temperature. Care must be taken not to overdose medications and clear instructions should be given to parents/caregivers on managing the child at home and when to seek further medical care.","Green, Robin; Webb, David; Jeena, Prakash Mohan; Wells, Mike; Butt, Nadia; Hangoma, Jimmy Mapenzi; Moodley, Rajatheran (Sham); Maimin, Jackie; Wibbelink, Margreet; Mustafa, Fatima",Afr J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.afjem.2020.11.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33912381/,150

This work analyzes several aspects of the data generated by different sensor types to understand particularities in the data, linking them with existing data mining methodologies. Using data from different sources, this work analyzes how the type of sensor used and its measurement units have an important impact in basic statistics such as variance and mean, because of the statistical distributions of the datasets. The work also analyzes the behavior of outliers, how to detect them, and how they affect the equivalence of sensors, as equivalence is used in many solutions for identifying anomalies. Based on the previous results, the article presents guidance on how to deal with data coming from sensors, in order to understand the characteristics of sensor datasets, and proposes a parallelized implementation. Finally, the article shows that the proposed decision-making processes work well with a new type of sensor and that parallelizing with several cores enables calculations to be executed up to four times faster.","Nieto, Francisco Javier; Aguilera, Unai; López-de-Ipiña, Diego",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577271/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21186063,150

Our objective was to evaluate the use of NIV in a cohort of (H1N1)v pneumonia. Usefulness and success of NIV were assessed in a prospective, observational registry of patients with influenza A (H1N1) virus pneumonia in 148 Spanish intensive care units (ICUs) in 2009–10. Significant variables for NIV success were included in a multivariate analysis. In all, 685 patients with confirmed influenza A (H1N1)v viral pneumonia were admitted to participating ICUs; 489 were ventilated, 177 with NIV. The NIV was successful in 72 patients (40.7%), the rest required intubation. Low Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, low Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and absence of renal failure were associated with NIV success. Success of NIV was independently associated with fewer than two chest X-ray quadrant opacities (OR 3.5) and no vasopressor requirement (OR 8.1). However, among patients with two or more quadrant opacities, a SOFA score ≤7 presented a higher success rate than those with SOFA score >7 (OR 10.7). Patients in whom NIV was successful required shorter ventilation time, shorter ICU stay and hospital stay than NIV failure. In patients in whom NIV failed, the delay in intubation did not increase mortality (26.5% versus 24.2%). Clinicians used NIV in 25.8% of influenza A (H1N1)v viral pneumonia admitted to ICU, and treatment was effective in 40.6% of them. NIV success was associated with shorter hospital stay and mortality similar to non-ventilated patients. NIV failure was associated with a mortality similar to those who were intubated from the start.","Masclans, J.R.; Pérez, M.; Almirall, J.; Lorente, L.; Marqués, A.; Socias, L.; Vidaur, L.; Rello, J.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03797.x; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14601312; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14601312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22404211/,150

Current therapeutic options are limited and there is no registered and/or definite treatment or vaccine for this disease or the causative infection, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS‐CoV‐2). Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a part of the renin‐angiotensin system (RAS), serves as the major entry point into cells for SARS‐CoV‐2 which attaches to human ACE2, thereby reducing the expression of ACE2 and causing lung injury and pneumonia. Vitamin D, a fat‐soluble‐vitamin, is a negative endocrine RAS modulator and inhibits renin expression and generation. It can induce ACE2/Ang‐(1‐7)/MasR axis activity and inhibits renin and the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis, thereby increasing expression and concentration of ACE2, MasR and Ang‐(1‐7) and having a potential protective role against acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, targeting the unbalanced RAS and ACE2 down‐regulation with vitamin D in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is a potential therapeutic approach to combat COVID‐19 and induced ARDS.","Malek Mahdavi, Aida",Rev Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32584474/,150

METHODS: We searched literature databases and COVID-19 research websites from January to October 2020. We selected relevant SRs reporting adequate search strategy, data synthesis, risk of bias assessment, and/or individual description of included studies describing COVID-19 and pregnancy outcomes. Pair of reviewers independently selected studies through COVIDENCE web-software, performed the data extraction, and assessed its quality through the AMSTAR-2 tool. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Each SR’s results were synthesized and for the most recent, relevant, comprehensive, and with the highest quality, by predefined criteria, we presented GRADE evidence tables. RESULTS: We included 66 SRs of observational studies out of 608 references retrieved and most (61/66) had ""critically low"" overall quality. We found a relatively low degree of primary study overlap across SRs. The most frequent COVID-19 clinical findings during pregnancy were fever (28–100%), mild respiratory symptoms (20–79%), raised C-reactive protein (28–96%), lymphopenia (34–80%), and pneumonia signs in diagnostic imaging (7–99%). The most frequent maternal outcomes were C-section (23–96%) and preterm delivery (14–64%). Most of their babies were asymptomatic (16–93%) or presented fever (0–50%), low birth weight (5–43%) or preterm delivery (2–69%). The odds ratio (OR) of receiving invasive ventilation for COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pregnant women was 1.88 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.36–2.60) and the OR that their babies were admitted to neonatal intensive care unit was 3.13 (95%CI 2.05–4.78). The risk of congenital transmission or via breast milk was estimated to be low, but close contacts may carry risks.

596445,Preparation and Antibacterial Activity Evaluation of 18-β-glycyrrhetinic Acid Loaded PLGA Nanoparticles,2015,"BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing in-centre haemodialysis (HD) are particularly exposed to the dire consequences of COVID-19. The present systematic scoping review aims to identify the extent, range, and nature of articles related to COVID-19 and maintenance HD: it reports specifically the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the HD population, implementation of strategies for the prevention, mitigation and containment of the COVID-19 pandemic in HD centres, demographic and clinical characteristics, and outcomes of the pediatric and adult HD patients. METHODS: A multi-step systematic search of the literature in Pubmed, Scopus, Ovid Medline, Embase and Web of Science, published between December 1, 2019, and January 30, 2021 was performed. Two authors separately screened the titles and abstracts of the documents and ruled out irrelevant articles. A report of the papers that met inclusion criteria was performed; then, a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the included articles and a narrative synthesis of the results were performed. RESULTS: The review process ended with the inclusion of 145 articles. Most of them were based on single-centre experiences, which spontaneously developed best practices. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries (69.7%) and a part of them (9.6%) were not in English. Prevalence of COVID-19 among dialysis patients accounted for 0%-37.6%. Preventive measures were reported in 54% of the included articles, with particular emphasis on education, triage, hygiene, and containment measures. Patients experienced a heterogeneous spectrum of symptoms that led 35%-88.2% of them to hospital admission. Median and mean hospital length of stay ranged from 8 to 28.5 and 16.2 to 22 days, respectively. Admission to intensive care units varied widely across studies (from 2.6% to 70.5%) and was associated with high mortality (42.8%–100%). Overall, prognosis was poor in 0%–47% of the hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic scoping review provides an overview of the current knowledge on the impact of COVID-19 on the frail world of HD patients. Furthermore, it may help to implement the existing strategies of COVID-19 prevention and provide a list of unmet needs (safe transport, testing, shelter). Finally, it may be a stimulus for performing systematic reviews and meta-analyses which will form the basis for evidence-based guidelines.

596612,Ultra-accurate microbial amplicon sequencing with synthetic long reads,2021-06-05,"Previous research has shown that sending personalized messages consistent with the recipient's psychological profile is essential to activate the change toward a healthy lifestyle. In this paper we present an example of how artificial intelligence can support psychology in this process, illustrating the development of a probabilistic predictor in the form of a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). The predictor regards the change in the intention to do home-based physical activity after message exposure. The data used to construct the predictor are those of a study on the effects of framing in communication to promote physical activity at home during the Covid-19 lockdown. The theoretical reference is that of psychosocial research on the effects of framing, according to which similar communicative contents formulated in different ways can be differently effective depending on the characteristics of the recipient. Study participants completed a first questionnaire aimed at measuring the psychosocial dimensions involved in doing physical activity at home. Next, they read recommendation messages formulated with one of four different frames (gain, non-loss, non-gain, and loss). Finally, they completed a second questionnaire measuring their perception of the messages and again the intention to exercise at home. The collected data were analyzed to elicit a DBN, i.e., a probabilistic structure representing the interrelationships between all the dimensions considered in the study. The adopted procedure was aimed to achieve a good balance between explainability and predictivity. The elicited DBN was found to be consistent with the psychosocial theories assumed as reference and able to predict the effectiveness of the different messages starting from the relevant psychosocial dimensions of the recipients. In the next steps of our project, the DBN will form the basis for the training of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) system for the synthesis of automatic interaction strategies. In turn, the DRL system will train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that will guide the online interaction process. The discussion focuses on the advantages of the proposed procedure in terms of interpretability and effectiveness.","Catellani, Patrizia; Carfora, Valentina; Piastra, Marco",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.696770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322068/,150

Gut dysbiosis is an imbalance between commensal and pathogenic bacteria and the production of microbial antigens and metabolites. The immune system and the gut microbiome interact to maintain homeostasis of the gut, and alterations in the microbiome composition lead to immune dysregulation, promoting chronic inflammation and development of tumors. Gut microorganisms and their toxic metabolites may migrate to other parts of the body via the circulatory system, causing an imbalance in the physiological status of the host and secretion of various neuroactive molecules through the gut-brain axis, gut-hepatic axis, and gut-lung axis to affect inflammation and tumorigenesis in specific organs. Thus, gut microbiota can be used as a tumor marker and may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of malignant tumors.","Ge, Yanshan; Wang, Xinhui; Guo, Yali; Yan, Junting; Abuduwaili, Aliya; Aximujiang, Kasimujiang; Yan, Jie; Wu, Minghua",J Exp Clin Cancer Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33494784/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13046-021-01845-6,150

METHODS: “COVID-19” was entered as the search term in Thomson Reuter’s Web of Science database. The 100 most cited articles (T100) were analyzed bibliometrically. Altmetric attention scores (AASs) and dimension badge scores of the articles were evaluated. RESULTS: T100 articles were published from January to September 2020. The average citation of the top 100 articles on COVID-19 was 320 ± 344.3 (143–2676). The language of all articles was English. The average Altmetric value of T100 is 3246 ± 3795 (85–16,548) and the mean dimension badge value was 670 ± 541.6 (176–4232).

The mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 above the age of 80 years is up to 54% in international studies. These observations indicate the necessity to highlight the geriatric perspective on this disease. The diagnostics and treatment of COVID-19 do not differ between younger and older patients but atypical symptoms should be expected more frequently in old age. Older subjects show an increased need for rehabilitation after COVID-19. Paradoxically, increasing rehabilitation demands go along with a reduced availability of geriatric rehabilitation options, the latter being a consequence of closure or downsizing of rehabilitation departments during the pandemic. In general, measures of isolation and quarantine should be diligently balanced as the health and emotional consequences of such measures may be severe in older persons. In light of the poor prognosis of older COVID-19 patients, advanced care planning becomes even more relevant. Caregivers and physicians should be encouraged to compose advanced care directives that also reflect the specific circumstances of COVID-19. Fortunately, current data suggest that the effectiveness of the vaccination with the mRNA-vaccines approved in Germany may be equally high in older compared to younger persons.","Wirth, R.; Becker, C.; Djukic, M.; Drebenstedt, C.; Heppner, H.

IPC were present in the non-adherent low-density cell subpopulation. Cell selection experiments using antibody (Ab)-coated immunomagnetic beads revealed that porcine IPC could be positively selected by anti-CD4 or -SLA-class-II Ab, but not by anti-CD2 or -CD8 Ab. The estimated IFN yield per IPC was found to increase when IPC were assayed at higher concentrations.

We believe it is time that the current health examination system for workers in the ROK considered the risk of transmissible diseases.","Seo, Eunhye; Mun, Eunchan; Kim, Wonsool; Lee, Changhwan",Ann Occup Environ Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32802338/; https://doi.org/10.35371/aoem.2020.32.e22,150
603503,Ecological Traits Driving the Outbreaks and Emergence of Zoonotic Pathogens,2016-02-01,"Efforts are continuing worldwide to understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatments for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, at the moment treatment remains supportive with oxygen therapy, steroids, repurposed antivirals, and prevention of multiple organ dysfunction by using immunomodulators. COVID-19 remains challenging since the disease spectrum varies from asymptomatic infection to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high fatality rates. It is thus necessary to predict clinical outcomes and risk-stratify patients for ensuring early intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. An important aspect is building surge capacity, managing and optimizing therapeutic and operational resources. So far, data have been scarce, particularly from India, to identify predictors of poor outcomes and mortality early in the course of the disease. Risk models need to be developed in larger patient cohorts and the models need to be simple and easy to employ at the onset of the disease process to predict the risk of severe disease, need for mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay (LOS), and mortality.

604013,On the Convergence Theory of Double K-Weak Splittings of Type II,2021-08-14,"ABSTRACT Introduction: The global population has been asked to live under tight restrictions to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Transmission-reducing behaviours (TRBs), (physical distancing, hand washing, wearing a face covering) were introduced by governments in 2020 prior to vaccine availability. People should maintain TRBs throughout the vaccination programme, because there is much uncertainty about the vaccine efficacy, immunity duration, whether there will be the requirement for booster vaccines, and whether vaccinated individuals can be carriers of the virus. This study will explore the effect of the vaccination programme in Scotland on adherence to TRBs. Methods and analysis: Telephone interviews will be conducted with participants from the nationally representative CHARIS project that agreed to be contacted for further research. Approximately 200, ten-minute telephone interviews will be conducted. Data will be collected on vaccine uptake or intention and adherence to TRBs. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and moderation analyses will be used to analyse the data collected. Ethical approval was granted by the Life Sciences and Medicine School Ethics Review Board (SERB) at the University of Aberdeen. Discussion: CHARIS-V will provide an understanding of the effect of the vaccination programme on adherence to TRBs in Scotland. Findings should be useful to governments and public health agencies for the current COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination programme and assist in the management of any future outbreaks.","Maciver, M.; Den Daas, C.; Johnston, M.; Dixon, D.; Hubbard, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.03.21256503v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.03.21256503,150

A lack of formal waste management (WM) systems in rural areas of Maseru have resulted in different indigenous systems and practices of SWM. Direct observation and descriptive designs will be employed. This is a mixed methods study of qualitative, quantitative and, non-experimental. We obtained data sets from existing official census and statistics of Maseru. We sampled 693 participants from total population of 6917. We received ethical clearance from Research Ethics committee of Health Sciences at the University of Johannesburg, we recruited six field workers. We have preventive equipment (sanitizers, masks, and sterile latex gloves) for COVID-19 infections in place; we have specific design on caps, masks and bags that will identify field workers as they collect data. We will train field workers, administer questionnaires, interview, and observe participants. STATKON will analyse data. The research will share the results with the Ministry of Environment and the community in Lesotho. The results will also be used to educate the rural communities on improved WM. Where weaknesses are identified, mitigation measures can be evaluated and implemented to rectify the negative aspects and improve the systems and practices. The rural communities face challenges such as waste collection services and sanitation facilities and this fact points out that there is a gap in SWM, which favours the existence of indigenous systems and practice of SWM.","Senekane, Mpinane Flory; Makhene, Agnes; Oelofse, Suzan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18105355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34069834/,150
604254,An ensemble learning approach to digital corona virus preliminary screening from cough sounds,2021-07-28,"BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), inducing profound metabolic changes associated with improvements in glycaemic control. In spite of the recognition of the physiological changes associated with bariatric surgery, what remains underappreciated is the patient experience of surgery to treat T2DM. OBJECTIVES: This study explored the patient experience with regard to motivations, expectations and outcomes, including remission and relapse of diabetes. METHODS: An in-depth qualitative approach was adopted, encompassing semi-structured interviews with patients (n=17) living with obesity and T2DM both pre- and postsurgery. Interpretive thematic analysis identified emergent themes using a grounded approach. RESULTS: Analysis revealed a number of themes throughout the interviews which included motivations and perceived benefits of surgery, obesity stigma and its impact on self-worth as well as perceptions of remission or relapse and the implications for sense of control. CONCLUSIONS: The motivation for undergoing bariatric surgery was driven by health concerns, namely T2DM and the desire to reduce the risk of developing diabetes-related complications. Patients highlighted social and self-stigmatisation associated with obesity and T2DM, leading to feelings of shame and an inability to seek support from family or healthcare professionals. Stigmatisation created a sense of failure and feeling of guilt for having T2DM. As a result, patients felt responsible for maintaining disease remission postoperatively and regarded the need for medication as a sign of treatment failure.","Sudlow, Alexis C.; Pournaras, Dimitri J.; Heneghan, Helen; Bodnar, Zsolt; le Roux, Carel W.; McGillicuddy, Deidre",Obes Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-021-05514-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120310/,150
604901,"Identification of a Covalent Importin-5 Inhibitor, Goyazensolide, from a Collective Synthesis of Furanoheliangolides",2021-05-25,"In late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, several patients with viral pneumonia were identified as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019‐nCoV). So far, there are no specific treatments for patients with coronavirus disease‐19 (COVID‐19), and the treatments available today are based on previous experience with similar viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome‐related coronavirus (SARS‐CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV), and Influenza virus. In this article, we have tried to reach a therapeutic window of drugs available to patients with COVID‐19. Cathepsin L is required for entry of the 2019‐nCoV virus into the cell as target teicoplanin inhibits virus replication. Angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme 2 (ACE2) in soluble form as a recombinant protein can prevent the spread of coronavirus by restricting binding and entry. In patients with COVID‐19, hydroxychloroquine decreases the inflammatory response and cytokine storm, but overdose causes toxicity and mortality. Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for 2019‐nCoV and are not recommended for treatment but protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) inhibit the progression of MERS‐CoV disease and can be useful for patients of COVID‐19 and, in combination with Arbidol, has a direct antiviral effect on early replication of SARS‐CoV. Ribavirin reduces hemoglobin concentrations in respiratory patients, and remdesivir improves respiratory symptoms. Use of ribavirin in combination with LPV/r in patients with SARS‐CoV reduces acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality, which has a significant protective effect with the addition of corticosteroids. Favipiravir increases clinical recovery and reduces respiratory problems and has a stronger antiviral effect than LPV/r. currently, appropriate treatment for patients with COVID‐19 is an ACE2 inhibitor and a clinical problem reducing agent such as favipiravir in addition to hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids.","Yousefi, Bahman; Valizadeh, Saeid; Ghaffari, Hadi; Vahedi, Azadeh; Karbalaei, Mohsen; Eslami, Majid",J Cell Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32394467/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.29785,150

Timely screening of high-risk population is important to improve the early detection of brucellosis among the endemic areas during the high incidence seasons, which is also required by the National Brucellosis Prevention and Control Plan (2016–2020) (NBPCP). What is added by this report? Seroepidemiological characteristics of brucellosis in high-risk populations were obtained and special occupational populations were found. The seroprevalence of brucellosis has been decreasing compared with that reported in the recent years due to the ongoing implementation of control measures in endemic areas. What are the implications for public health practice? Special occupational populations could be promptly detected using routine screening, which makes it possible to initiate standardized treatment for infected patients as early as possible. It also reminds us to pay attention to special occupational populations to improve their knowledge of brucellosis and reduce the risk of infection.","Lin, Shenghong; Wang, Zhe; Liu, Xinrong; Yu, Aizhi; Muhtar·Hasan,; Jiensi·Bayidawulieti,; Haitan·Aximujiang,; Li, Ruiqing; Zheng, Guoxing; Liang, Xinwang; Fan, Xiaoling; Hou, Biqiao; Fan, Xiaolong; Dilxat·Abuliti,; Shi, Lusha; Zhang, Cuihong; Wang, Yifei; Ning, Pengjing; Liu, Caixiong; Li, Zhongjie; Wang, Liping",China CDC Wkly,https://doi.org/10.46234/ccdcw2021.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34595013/,150
605372,"Natural Products and Their Derivatives with Antibacterial, Antioxidant and Anticancer Activities",2021-01-13,"The appearance of multiple new SARS-CoV-2 variants during the winter of 2020–2021 is a matter of grave concern. Some of these new variants, such as B.1.351 and B.1.1.17, manifest higher infectivity and virulence than the earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants, with potential dramatic effects on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, analysis of new SARS-CoV-2 variants focused primarily on point nucleotide substitutions and short deletions that are readily identifiable by comparison to consensus genome sequences. In contrast, insertions have largely escaped the attention of researchers although the furin site insert in the spike protein is thought to be a determinant of SARS-CoV-2 virulence and other inserts might have contributed to coronavirus pathogenicity as well. Here, we investigate insertions in SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identify 141 unique inserts of different lengths. We present evidence that these inserts reflect actual virus variance rather than sequencing errors. Two principal mechanisms appear to account for the inserts in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, polymerase slippage and template switch that might be associated with the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs. We show that inserts in the Spike glycoprotein can affect its antigenic properties and thus have to be monitored. At least, two inserts in the N-terminal domain of the Spike (ins246DSWG and ins15ATLRI) that were first detected in January 2021 are predicted to lead to escape from neutralizing antibodies whereas other inserts might result in escape from T-cell immunity.","Garushyants, Sofya K.; Rogozin, Igor B.; Koonin, Eugene V.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907754/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.23.441209,150

We studied the vaccination history variation among the US adults who use drugs by implementing a community-engaged research survey to identify reported immunization coverage, missed opportunities (MO), and places where immunizations might be delivered. Our analysis of a sample of 1127 participants recruited at community syringe exchanges in three cities identified higher overall vaccination receipt in Los Angeles compared to Atlanta or Las Vegas (e.g., HAV receipt 52.2% LA, 42.1% LV, 41.4% Atlanta). Overall, fewer participants reported having received HAV (45.9%), HBV (47.5%), or influenza (47.6%) vaccines than MMR (57.1%) or Td/Tdap (61.1%). Across sites, HAV receipt was higher for participants incarcerated ≥ 5 years (54.2% vs. 43.6% for those incarcerated < 5 years, 49.4% no incarceration history, p = 0.02). HBV receipt was higher among participants who were not intravenous drug users (56.1% vs. 46.0%, p = 0.03).

As no preventive vaccines or antiviral drugs against these two re-emerging pathogens are available, we evaluated whether the molecular tweezer CLR01 may inhibit EBOV and ZIKV infection. This small molecule has previously been shown to inactivate HIV-1 and herpes viruses through a selective interaction with lipid-raft-rich regions in the viral envelope, which results in membrane disruption and loss of infectivity. We found that CLR01 indeed blocked infection of EBOV and ZIKV in a dose-dependent manner. The tweezer inhibited infection of epidemic ZIKV strains in cells derived from the anogenital tract and the central nervous system, and remained antivirally active in the presence of semen, saliva, urine and cerebrospinal fluid.

The goal of this study was to create a “simulated” daily readout (SDR) to restore the educational value of the daily readout. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To create the SDR the following tasks were performed; selection of cases for a daily worklist for each resident rotation, comprising a combination of normal and abnormal cases; determination of the correct number of cases and the appropriate mix of imaging modalities for each worklist; development of an ""educational"" environment consisting of separate ""instances"" of both our Picture Archive Communication System and reporting systems; and the anonymization of all of the cases on the worklists. Surveys of both residents and faculty involved in the SDR were performed to assess its effectiveness. RESULTS: Thirty-two residents participated in the SDR. The daily worklists for the first 20 days of the SDR included 3682 cases. An average of 480 cases per day was dictated by the residents. Surveys of the residents and the faculty involved in the SDR demonstrated that both agreed that the SDR effectively mimics a resident's daily work on rotations and preserves resident education during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 crisis.

The success of an intervention depends on the transmissibility of the disease and the contact pattern between persons within a community. The model predicts that use of face masks and general vaccination will only moderately affect the spread of mildly contagious diseases.

Recent evidence revealed that DNA methylation changes take place at proximal promoters within susceptibility genes. This emphasizes the need for integrating multiple data types to provide a better understanding of the disease’s pathogenesis. One such candidate gene is paraoxonase-1 (PON1). Substantial interindividual differences in PON1 are apparent and could influence disease risk later in life. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the different regulatory aspects of PON1 variability and to examine them in relation to the predisposition to obesity-associated fatty liver disease. RESULTS: A targeted multi-omics approach was applied to investigate the interplay between PON1 genetic variants, promoter methylation, expression profile and enzymatic activity in an adult patient cohort with extensive metabolic and hepatic characterisation including liver biopsy. Alterations in PON1 status were shown to correlate with waist-to-hip ratio and relevant features of liver pathology. Particularly, the regulatory polymorphism rs705379:C > T was strongly associated with more severe liver disease. Multivariable data analysis furthermore indicated a significant association of combined genetic and epigenetic PON1 regulation. This identified relationship postulates a role for DNA methylation as a mediator between PON1 genetics and expression, which is believed to further influence liver disease progression via modifications in PON1 catalytic efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that vertical data-integration of genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms generated a more in-depth understanding of the molecular basis underlying the development of obesity-associated fatty liver disease. We gained novel insights into how NAFLD classification and outcome are orchestrated, which could not have been obtained by exclusively considering genetic variation.

Compared to nonspreaders, spreaders exhibited a longer interval from symptom onset to isolation (7 days vs 3 days) and more frequent pre-isolation pneumonia diagnoses (68.2% vs 17.1%). Spreaders also exhibited higher values for pre-isolation contacts (149 vs 17.5), pre-isolation hospitalization (68.2% vs 16.5%), and emergency room (ER) visits (50% vs 7.3%). Spreaders exhibited lower cycle thresholds for the upE and ORF1a genes (22.7 vs 27.2 and 23.7 vs 27.9, respectively). In multivariate analysis, transmission was independently associated with the cycle threshold (odds ratio [OR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75–0.96) and pre-isolation hospitalization or ER visits (OR, 6.82; 95% CI, 2.06–22.84). The super-spreading events exhibited higher values for pre-isolation contacts (777 vs 78), pre-isolation ER visits (100% vs 35.3%), and doctor shopping (100% vs 47.1%) compared to non-super-spreading events. CONCLUSIONS. These findings indicate that transmission is determined by host infectivity and the number of contacts, whereas super-spreading events were determined by the number of contacts and hospital visits. These relationships highlight the importance of rapidly enforcing infection control measures to prevent outbreaks.","Kim, Seung Woo; Park, Jung Wan; Jung, Hee-Dong; Yang, Jeong-Sun; Park, Yong-Shik; Lee, Changhwan; Kim, Kyung Min; Lee, Keon-Joo; Kwon, Donghyok; Hur, Young Joo; Choi, BoYoul; Ki, Moran",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27940937/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciw768,150

Alternative approaches based on combinations of isothermal amplification and CRISPR-mediated detection, such as the SHERLOCK (Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) technique, offer reduced dependence on RT-qPCR equipment, but previously reported methods required multiple fluid handling steps, complicating their deployment outside clinical labs. Here we developed a simple test chemistry called STOP (SHERLOCK Testing in One Pot) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in one hour that is suitable for point-of-care use. This simplified test, STOPCovid, provides sensitivity comparable to RT-qPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 tests and has a limit of detection of 100 copies of viral genome input in saliva or nasopharyngeal swabs per reaction. Using lateral flow readout, the test returns result in 70 minutes, and using fluorescence readout, the test returns result in 40 minutes. Moreover, we validated STOPCovid using nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients and were able to correctly diagnose 12 positive and 5 negative patients out of 3 replicates. We envision that implementation of STOPCovid will significantly aid “test-trace-isolate” efforts, especially in low-resource settings, which will be critical for long-term public health safety and effective reopening of the society.","Joung, Julia; Ladha, Alim; Saito, Makoto; Segel, Michael; Bruneau, Robert; Huang, Mee-li W.; Kim, Nam-Gyun; Yu, Xu; Li, Jonathan; Walker, Bruce D.; Greninger, Alexander L.; Jerome, Keith R.; Gootenberg, Jonathan S.; Abudayyeh, Omar O.; Zhang, Feng",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.20091231v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511521/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.20091231,150

We present short-term follow-up data concerning mild to moderate disease in home-quarantined COVID-19 patients in Greece. METHODS: We provided a symptom questionnaire and instructions for a self-administered home smell-and-taste test to 79 positive COVID-19 patients from 2 tertiary hospitals in Greece. The patients recorded their subjective symptoms before and during infection as well as 4 weeks after the diagnosis. The patients also underwent the home test during infection and 4 weeks later. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (36.7%) reported a loss of smell, and 21 (27.8%) reported a loss of taste, with equal prevalences between genders. We observed 2 types of recovery, i.e., a rapid, almost complete recovery, and a second slower and partial recovery. The type of recovery was not age related. A rapid recovery was observed in two thirds of the patients, with their olfactory ratings presenting a trend towards significance in correlation with nasal obstruction. A slow recovery in olfaction was correlated with low intensity ratings in odors with a trigeminal compound. The loss of taste was more pronounced in sweet and salty intensity ratings. CONCLUSION: Chemosensory deficits associated with COVID-19 infection were quite frequent among the Greek patients with mild or moderate disease who, in most cases, returned to normal within 4 weeks. However, 1 in 3 patients presented with persistent olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in the short term.","Konstantinidis, Iordanis; Delides, Alexander; Tsakiropoulou, Evangelia; Maragoudakis, Pavlos; Sapounas, Spyridon; Tsiodras, Sotirios",ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33049753/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000511436,150

Considering the lack of closeness of extant PFLS operations and the interrelationship among input attributes do not consider. In this paper, for the sake of addressing those limitations, we firstly redefine some novel operational laws for PFLS by introducing linguistic scale functions and the related properties are studied. Then, a novel score function and accuracy function are also defined to compare PFLSs. Subsequently, in consideration of the superiority of the Muirhead Mean (MM) operator in capturing the interaction relationship between the input parameters, we extend the MM operator to the Picture fuzzy linguistic context and then propose Picture fuzzy linguistic weighted MM operator and its dual form in a new light. After that, these operators have adopted to build two novel models to solve multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problems.

Demographic and clinical data of COVID-19 patients until June 11th, 2020 were retrieved from the State Health Secretariat of Espírito Santo, Brazil. Potential risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization and death were analyzed by univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 10,713 COVID-19 patients were included in this study; 81.0% were younger than 60 years, 55.2% were female, 89.2% were not hospitalized, 32.9% had at least one comorbidity, and 7.7% died. The most common symptoms on admission were cough (67.7%) and fever (62.6%); 7.1% of the patients were asymptomatic. Cardiovascular diseases (23.7%) and diabetes (10.3%) were the two most common chronic diseases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified an association of all explanatory variables, except for cough and diarrhea, with hospitalization. Older age (odds ratio [OR] = 3.95, P < 0.001) and shortness of breath (OR = 3.55, P < 0.001) were associated with increase of odds to COVID-19 death in hospitalized patients. Our study provided evidence that older age, male gender, Asian, indigenous or unknown race, comorbidities (smoking, kidney disease, obesity, pulmonary disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), as well as fever and shortness of breath increased the risk of hospitalization. For death outcome in hospitalized patients, only older age and shortness of breath increased the risk.","Soares, Rita de Cássia Menezes; Mattos, Larissa Rodrigues; Raposo, Letícia Martins",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32682453/,150
614041,Antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of viral infections,2017-07-10,"Various anthropogenic and natural events over the years have gradually increased human exposure to various heavy metals. Several of these heavy metals including cadmium, mercury, nickel, chromium, and the metalloid arsenic among others, have created major public health concerns for their high level of toxicities. Identification of the general as well as the differentially affected cellular metabolic pathways will help understanding the molecular mechanism of different heavy metal-induced toxicities. In this study, we analyzed 25 paired (control vs. treated) transcriptomic datasets derived following treatment of various human cells with different heavy metals and metalloid (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, iron, mercury, nickel and vanadium) to identify the affected metabolic pathways. The effects of these metals on metabolic pathways depend not only on the metals per se, but also on the nature of the treated cells. Tissue of origin, therefore, must be considered while assessing the effects of any particular heavy metal or metalloid. Among the metals and metalloid, arsenic appears to have relatively more pleiotropic influences on cellular metabolic pathways including those known to have association with diabetes. Although only two stem cell derived datasets are included in the current study, effects of heavy metals on these cells appear to be different from other mature cells of similar tissue origin. This study provides useful information about different heavy metal affected pathways, which may be useful in further exploration using wet-lab based techniques.","Fatema, Kaniz; Shoily, Sabrina Samad; Ahsan, Tamim; Haidar, Zinia; Sumit, Ahmed Faisal; Sajib, Abu Ashfaqur",Toxicol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34141598/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.05.015,150

Our study planned to investigate TDH in COVID-19 patients. Age and gender-matched healthy subjects (n = 70) and COVID-19 patients (n = 144) were included in the study. In addition to the routine laboratory parameters of the groups, their native thiol (NT), total thiol (TT) and disulphide levels were measured. Primarily, we compared COVID-19 patients to the healthy control group for inflammatory parameters, NT, TT and disulphide levels. Then, COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of the disease as mild to moderate and severe COVID-19, and the three groups were compared with each other. Predictive value of thiol parameters in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and in the determining its severity, and its correlation with presence and duration of symptoms were investigated. Severe COVID-19 patients had lower NT and TT levels compared with healthy controls and mild to moderate patients (P < 0.001 for both). The results of ROC analysis show that the greatest AUC was IL-6 and NT (AUC = 0.97, AUC = 0.96, respectively) between control and COVID-19 patients, while it was CRP and NT (AUC = 0.85, AUC = 0.83) between mild to moderate and severe patients. A negative correlation was found between duration of symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, fever, and sore throat and NT (r = −0.45, P = 0.017, r = −0.418, P < 0.001, r = −0.131, P = 0.084, r = −0.452, P = 0.040, respectively).

616321,"Localized, Targeted, and Sustained siRNA Delivery",2011-02-21,"There is strong evidence that COVID-19 pathophysiology is mainly driven by a spatiotemporal immune deregulation. Both its phenotypic heterogeneity, spanning from asymptomatic to severe disease/death, and its associated mortality, are dictated by and linked to maladaptive innate and adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic factor of the disease. Deregulated interferon and cytokine responses, with the contribution of immune and cellular stress-response mediators (like cellular senescence or uncontrolled inflammatory cell death), result in innate and adaptive immune system malfunction, endothelial activation and inflammation (endothelitis), as well as immunothrombosis (with enhanced platelet activation, NET production/release and complement hyper-activation). All these factors play key roles in the development of severe COVID-19. Interestingly, another consequence of this immune deregulation, is the production of autoantibodies and the subsequent development of autoimmune phenomena observed in some COVID-19 patients with severe disease. These new aspects of the disease that are now emerging (like autoimmunity and cellular senescence), could offer us new opportunities in the field of disease prevention and treatment. Simultaneously, lessons already learned from the immunobiology of COVID-19 could offer new insights, not only for this disease, but also for a variety of chronic inflammatory responses observed in autoimmune and (auto)inflammatory diseases.","Kaklamanos, Aimilios; Belogiannis, Konstantinos; Skendros, Panagiotis; Gorgoulis, Vassilis G.; Vlachoyiannopoulos, Panayiotis G.; Tzioufas, Athanasios G.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34512643/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.719023,150

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of GBS in which SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in the CSF, further strengthening the role of the virus as a trigger. In conclusion, our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies need to be searched in the serum and CSF in patients with GBS living in endemic areas, even in the absence of a clinically severe COVID-19 infection, and that IL-8 pathway can be relevant in Si-GBS pathogenesis. Further studies are needed to conclude on the relevance of the genetic findings, but it is likely that HLA plays a role in this setting as in other autoimmune neurological syndromes, including those triggered by infections.","Gigli, Gian Luigi; Vogrig, Alberto; Nilo, Annacarmen; Fabris, Martina; Biasotto, Alessia; Curcio, Francesco; Miotti, Valeria; Tascini, Carlo; Valente, Mariarosaria",Neurol Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04787-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006723/,150

However, the mechanisms controlling ACE2 expression remain elusive. Here, we identify the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) as a direct regulator of ACE2 transcription in multiple COVID19-affected tissues, including the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems. We demonstrate that FXR antagonists, including the over-the-counter compound z-guggulsterone (ZGG) and the off-patent drug ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), downregulate ACE2 levels, and reduce susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung, cholangiocyte and gut organoids. We then show that therapeutic levels of UDCA downregulate ACE2 in human organs perfused ex situ and reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection ex vivo. Finally, we perform a retrospective study using registry data and identify a correlation between UDCA treatment and positive clinical outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection, including hospitalisation, ICU admission and death. In conclusion, we identify a novel function of FXR in controlling ACE2 expression and provide evidence that this approach could be beneficial for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby paving the road for future clinical trials.","Brevini, Teresa; Maes, Mailis; Webb, Gwilym J.; Gelson, William T.

The fusion protein consists of the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) conjugated to the N-terminal helix (NTH) of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. For vaccination, this fusion protein is to be administered together with the whole killed virus. The NTH would bind to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike protein of the killed virus. Due to HBsAg acting as a decoy, immune responses would be mounted. Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) pre-existing in people already vaccinated with the recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine, fresh production of NAbs, and NAbs produced by memory B cells would bind to the HBsAg. This would lead to ""presentation"" of the killed virus to elements of the immune system at close range. Also, there would be enhanced opsonization and effective antigen presentation. This two-component vaccine could be a platform strategy, wherein HBsAg could be linked to the part of the cellular receptor that any new intractable virus binds to, and is administered together with whole inactivated virus. Now, the same fusion protein, administered by itself to persons with infection, would have therapeutic action, yet by harnessing elements of the immune system. NAbs would bind to the fusion protein as above, the NTH of which would bind to the RBDs of the infecting virus, which, in effect would be neutralized.","Deshpande, Manisha S; Banerjee, Tanushree",IUBMB life,https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.2548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34455696/,150
620117,Caring for Older Adults,2020-09-30,"BACKGROUND: The year 2020 was marked by the new coronavirus pandemic, resulting in millions of cases and deaths, placing healthcare workers at high risk of infection. AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe the role of an occupational health service during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in an oncologic hospital and characterize the most likely sources of viral infection. METHODS: The information of all healthcare workers with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from 11 March to 15 December 2020 was collected through an epidemiological survey conducted during contact tracing. The data extracted included gender, age, comorbidities, occupational group, source of infection, clinical presentation, duration of the disease, need for hospitalization and persistent or late symptoms after disease or upon returning to work. RESULTS: Out of a total of 2300 workers, 157 were infected, consisting of nurses (36%), nurse assistants (33%) and diagnostic and therapeutic professionals (10%). Physicians and administrative staff accounted for 8% each. The most frequently reported source of infection was occupational (43%), owing to worker-to-worker transmission (45%) and patient-to-worker transmission (36%). The most frequent moments of infection perceived corresponded to the removal of protective equipment during meals and moments of rest in the staff and changing rooms. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that occupational transmission from patients and colleagues might be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers. Spread between colleagues accounted for 45% of the occupational source infections reported. Implementing physical distancing measures and limiting the number of people in changing and rest rooms could significantly reduce infection and related absenteeism.","Ochoa-Leite, C; Bento, J; Rocha, D R; Vasques, I; Cunha, R; Oliveira, Á; Rocha, L",Occup Med (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34415346/; https://doi.org/10.1093/occmed/kqab117,150

Early diagnosis of suspected patients will play an essential role in preventing further spread of COVID-19. The aim of this review study was to evaluate saliva specimen in comparison to nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimen in studies selected from various databases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To achieve the objective of this study, a systematic literature search was carried out in four databases, namely PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and LILACS. The keywords ″COVID-19″, ″Nasopharyngeal Swab″, and ″Saliva″ were utilized via Boolean operators. RESULTS: 14 articles were included in this review study following the eligibility criteria. Based on data presented in studies used in the meta-analysis, there was no significant difference between both specimen types for detection of COVID-19. Heterogeneity test showed that I(2) value was 5.790% (<20%). The effect size (risk ratio) of the 14 studies was 0.951 (<1). CONCLUSION: With the results revealing no significant difference between the two types of specimen in the diagnosis of COVID-19, the use of saliva specimen is preferable for widespread use because it is easily collected without the need for qualified health workers. However, more in vivo studies are required in order to compare and evaluate saliva and NPS specimens in detecting COVID-19 using various techniques.","Nasiri, Kaveh; Dimitrova, Aleksandra",J Dent Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1991790221000106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558826/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1991790221000106?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jds.2021.01.010,150
620588,Laboratories and pandemic preparedness: A framework for collaboration and oversight,2020-05-16,"While the COVID-19 pandemic has added stressors to the lives of healthcare workers, it is unclear which factors represent the most useful targets for interventions to mitigate employee distress across the entire healthcare team. A survey was distributed to employees of a large healthcare system in the Southeastern United States, and 1,130 respondents participated. The survey measured overall distress using the 9-item Well-Being Index (WBI), work-related factors, moral distress, resilience, and organizational-level factors. Respondents were also asked to identify major work, clinical, and nonwork stressors. Multivariate regression was used to evaluate associations between employee characteristics and WBI distress score. Overall, 82% of employees reported high distress (WBI ≥ 2), with nurses, clinical support staff, and advanced practice providers reporting the highest average scores. Factors associated with higher distress included increased job demands or responsibilities, heavy workload or long hours, higher frequency of moral distress, and loneliness or social isolation. Factors associated with lower distress were perceived organizational support, work control, perceived fairness of salary cuts, and resilience. Most factors significantly associated with distress—heavy workloads and long hours, increased job demands, and moral distress, in particular—were work-related, indicating that efforts can be made to mitigate them. Resilience explained a small portion of the variance in distress relative to other work-related factors. Ensuring appropriate staffing levels may represent the single largest opportunity to significantly move the needle on distress. However, the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare system may represent a barrier to addressing these stressors.","Meese, Katherine A.; Colón-López, Alejandra; Singh, Jasvinder A.; Burkholder, Greer A.; Rogers, David A.",J Healthc Manag,https://doi.org/10.1097/jhm-d-20-00288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228687/,150

621750,Novel Human Rhinoviruses and Exacerbation of Asthma in Children,2008-11-11,"BACKGROUND: The public health workforce (PHW) is a key component of a country’s public health system. Since the outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003, the scale of PHW in China has been continuously expanding, but policymakers and researchers still focus on the distribution of public health personnel, especially the regional inequality in such distribution. We aimed to identify the root cause of PHW inequality by decomposing different geographical units in China. METHODS: This study was based on data from a nationwide survey, which included 2712 county-level data. The distribution of the PHW in geographical units was evaluated by the Gini coefficient and Theil T index, and inequalities at regional, provincial, and municipal levels were decomposed to identify the root causes of inequalities in the PHW. Additionally, the contextual factors affecting the distribution of the PHW were determined through regression analysis. RESULTS: The overall inequality results show that health professional and field epidemiological investigators faced worse inequality than the staff. In particular, field epidemiological investigators had a Gini coefficient close to 0.4. Step decomposition showed that within-region inequalities accounted for 98.5% or more of overall inter-county inequality in the distribution of all PHW categories; provincial decomposition showed that at least 74% of inequality is still distributed within provinces; the overall contribution of within-municipal inequality and between-municipal inequality was basically the same. Further, the contextual factor that influenced between-municipality and within-municipality inequality for all three categories of PHWs was the agency building area per employee. Per capita GDP had a similar effect, except for between-municipality inequality of professionals and within-municipality inequality of field epidemiological investigators. CONCLUSIONS: The successive decomposition showed that inequality is mainly concentrated in counties at the within-province and within-municipal levels. This study clearly suggests that the government, especially the municipal government at the provincial level, should increase financial investment in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) with worse resource allocation in their jurisdiction through various ways of compensation and incentives, enhance their infrastructure, and improve the salary of personnel in these institutions, to attract more public health professionals to these institutions.","Cai, Weiqin; Li, Chengyue; Sun, Mei; Hao, Mo",Int J Equity Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-019-1073-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752854/,150

622613,The challenge of PRRS immunology,2007-07-20,"The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a major public health emergency worldwide with over 118.27-million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 2.62-million deaths recorded, as of March 12, 2021. Although this disease primarily targets lungs, damages in other organs, such as heart, kidney, liver, and testis, may occur. Testis is the cornerstone of male reproduction, while reproductive health is the most valuable resource for continuity of the human race. Given the unique nature of SARS-CoV-2, the mechanisms of its impact on the testes have yet to be fully explored. Notably, coronaviruses have been found to invade target cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which can be found in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, urinary tract, and reproductive organs, such as testes. Coronavirus studies have suggested that testes might be a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The first etiopathogenic concept proposed by current hypotheses indicates that the virus can invade testes through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Next, the activated inflammatory response in the testes, disease-associated fever, and COVID-19 medications might be implicated in testicular alterations. Although evidence regarding the presence of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA in semen remains controversial, this emphasizes the need for researchers to pay closer attention to sexually transmitted diseases and male fertility after recovering from COVID-19. In this review the latest updates regarding COVID-19-associated testicular dysfunction are summarized and possible pathogenic mechanisms are discussed.","Abdel-Moneim, Adel",Biochemistry (Mosc),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33941061/; https://doi.org/10.1134/s0006297921040015,150

However, the health burden has been largely felt in communities involving racial and ethnic minorities. Thus, in order to provide a clearer picture of what is happening in Black, Indigenous, and people of color communities, we examined the racial/ethnic differences of monthly COVID-19 deaths in Connecticut. METHODS: This is an epidemiological study analyzing mortality data from March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021, obtained from the Connecticut State Department of Public Health. The data include cause of death (COVID-19 death identified by ICD-10 code U071), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White (White), non-Hispanic Black (Black), and Hispanic), sex, and age. Both crude and age-adjusted rates were reported by racial/ethnic groups. To compare age-adjusted rates between racial groups, with estimated age-adjusted death counts as outcomes, between-racial group rate ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p values significant at < 0.05 were derived from the Poisson regression model. RESULTS: From March 2020 to May 2020 (wave 1) of COVID-19 cases, the COVID-19-related mortality rates were the highest for all three race groups (Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics) with statistical group differences (p < 0.05). Blacks had the highest rates of deaths followed by Hispanics and then Whites. Further, more Whites died in a nursing home when compared to Blacks and Hispanics. From June 2010 to October 2020 (wave 2), COVID-19 mortality declined significantly for all three race groups with no statistical differences between groups. COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes declined for all three racial/ethnic groups. From November 2020 to February 2021 (wave 3), COVID-19 mortality rates were significantly higher compared to wave 2 but lower than wave 1 for all three race groups. The mortality rates for Blacks and Hispanics were higher than Whites. Hispanics had the highest rates of deaths, followed by Blacks, and then Whites (p < 0.05). Whites showed the lowest mortality rates among all three racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, COVID-19 health disparities among Black and Hispanic populations were evident in this study. Blacks and Hispanics had significantly higher mortality rates when compared to Whites. Blacks had the highest mortality rates during wave 1, and in wave 3, Hispanics has the highest mortality rates. Our data are important because they show monthly COVID-19 deaths data by race.

Our aim was to review the recommendations and best practices in return to play in non-professional football after activity lockdown. The authors searched two electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science) to extract studies published before September 15 2020. Twenty studies explained recommendations, considerations, or best practices in return to play in football, and all of them were clustered into three groups: (1) training load management (n = 10), (2) medical recommendations (n = 9), and (3) recovery related issues (n = 5). The way to establish a progression in training process should be based on training load management and managing the number of stimuli per time. Following the studies, this training process should be divided into three phases: phase 1—physical distancing should be maintained; phases 2 and 3—group training should start. Medical considerations were clustered into different groups: general, pre- and post- training, during training, education, planning to return to competition, and suggestions for post confinement weeks. In particular, social issues, strict hygiene questions, and continuous PCR testing should be considered in return to play over football season. Finally, since a correlation has been found between high-intensive training loads and immunoglobulin A, nutritional and lifestyle recovery strategies should be performed. Moreover, since immunosuppression has been related to congested schedules (<72 h between matches), football federations should avoid this situation.","Rico-González, Markel; Pino-Ortega, José; Ardigò, Luca Paolo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33445452/,150

The review aimed to search for original peer-reviewed articles published in indexed journals, in addition to the specialized gray literature. We reviewed 386 texts and included 33 articles and documents in the study. The review's results pointed to three thematic categories that reflect the main discussions on the theme in the literature: vulnerabilities of persons with disabilities during the pandemic;rights of persons with disabilities in this context;and protective measures and access to information on COVID-19 for persons with disabilities. In the context of the public health emergency, historically marginalized communities such as persons with disabilities run the risk of feeling more vulnerable, suffering deprivations, discrimination in screening plans for care, and prejudices and stigmas that influence decision-making in healthcare and exacerbate preexisting inequalities, making this group more susceptible to illness and lack of social protection. Although persons with disabilities have been acknowledged as a risk group for COVID-19, governments have been slow to develop plans to fight COVID-19 for this population. Few studies have attempted to understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on persons with disabilities, especially in the sense of implementing measures in prevention, control, and protection that guarantee equity in care.","Saldanha, J.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Germany, the diagnostic outcomes of critically ill patients admitted to the resuscitation room in the ED of our academic 754-bed hospital should be analyzed. METHODS: All resuscitation room patients between March 1st and April 15th 2020 were included in this retrospective study. Every patient with suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a pharyngeal swab for real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR), divided in the clinical subgroups of “highly suspicious for COVID-19” and “COVID-19 as differential diagnosis.” All respiratory and infectious symptoms were included as at least “differential diagnosis” as an expanded suspicion strategy. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were included (trauma n = 14, critically ill n = 81). Of 3 highly suspicious patients, 2 had rt-PCR positive pharyngeal swabs. In 39 patients, COVID-19 was defined as differential diagnosis, and 3 were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of them, pharyngeal swabs were positive in 1 case, while in 2 cases, only tracheal fluid was rt-PCR positive while the pharyngeal swabs were negative. In one of these 2 cases, chest computed tomography (CT) was also negative for ground-glass opacities but showed a pulmonary abscess and pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSION: We recommend an expanded suspicion strategy for COVID-19 due to unexpected diagnostic outcomes. Personal protective equipment should be used in every resuscitation room operation due to unexpected cases and initial knowledge gaps. Furthermore, tracheal fluid should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 in every intubated patient due to cases with negative pharyngeal swabs and negative chest CT.","Bergrath, Sebastian; Aretz, Olaf; Haake, Hendrik; Ringelstein, Adrian; Greiffendorf, Ingo; Graeven, Ullrich; Windfuhr, Jochen",Biomed Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/2721381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884938/,150

Bat contact and consumption, which persists in Asia, poses risks for the transmission of bat-borne infections. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional survey for risk factors associated with bat contact and consumption behaviors was conducted in ten provinces of Thailand from May 2016 to December 2017. A standardized questionnaire administered through face-to-face interviews was used to collect information from 626 villagers who lived in or nearby areas of high bat density. The questionnaire contained 23 independent variables related to sociodemographic, knowledge, attitudes, practices, and perceptions. RESULTS: The respondents (n = 626) were 285 females and 341 males, mean age of respondents was 47.58 years-old and lived in rural setting. Our results showed that 36.42% of respondents (n(1) = 228) in 10 provinces reported bat contact during the past 6 months. Furthermore, 15.34% of respondents (n(2) = 96) in 9 out of 10 provinces reported of having consumed bat meat in the past 6 months. Risk factors for bat contact included sex (male) (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.09–2.28), educational attainment (lower than secondary school) (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.02–2.18), and the consideration of bats as being economically beneficial to the community (OR = 3.18, 95% CI 2.03–4.97), while agriculture-related occupation (OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.37–0.79), knowledge that it is safe to eat bats (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.37–0.93), practice of allowing children to play with bats (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.44–0.96), and attitude of feeling safe in areas where bats live (OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.38–0.86) were statistically significant protective factors against bat contact. Risk factors for bat consumption included sex (male) (OR = 2.48, 95% CI 1.49–4.11) and educational attainment (lower than secondary school) (OR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.27–3.85), while knowledge of whether bats are safe to eat (OR = 0.04, 95% CI 0.01–0.25), knowledge of whether there are laws pertaining to hunting bats for consumption (OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.18–0.71), and the practice of allowing children to play with bats (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.31–0.81) were statistically significant protective factors against bat consumption. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a better understanding of the sociodemographic factors, knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and practices that might influence bat contact and bat consumption behaviors. Information on risk factors can be used for the development of appropriate education and communication interventions to promote proper knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding bats and bat-borne zoonotic diseases in Thailand and other areas in the Southeast Asia region with similar environmental and cultural characteristics.","Suwannarong, Kanokwan; Chanabun, Sutin; Kanthawee, Phitsanuruk; Khiewkhern, Santisith; Boonyakawee, Paisit; Suwannarong, Kangsadal; Saengkul, Chutarat; Bubpa, Nisachon; Amonsin, Alongkorn",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32493260/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-08968-z,150

Preliminary studies have put in evidence how different social groups faced a differentiated risk of contagion and coped differently with the various consequences of the emergency. Evidence shows how minorities and migrants face disproportionally higher risks of contagion than the white upper and middle class, and how vulnerable communities are more exposed to deaths and the rapid spread of the virus. At the same time, societies are coping with social distancing measures and their disruptive social and economic consequences, which have a more significant impact on the most vulnerable segments of societies: women, children, low-income classes and ethnic minorities. This article argues that an intersectional framework allows an understanding of what is occurring in the current pandemic, both in terms of its social determinants and social consequences. To open the black box of inequality, intersectional scholars analyze the intersections of multiple structures of inequalities (such as gender, age, class, ethnicity), which have a multiplying effect when disadvantaged positions intersect in the same individual. Covid-19 is a clear example of an intersectional phenomenon: the impact of individual and community exposure to Covid-19 is the results of multiple and interrelating structures of inequality. Up to now, research in social sciences has underestimated the role of intersectionality in analyzing the social and economic consequences of this pandemic.","Maestripieri, Lara",Front Sociol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33869589/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.642662,150

Objective: This study aimed to develop an age-structured compartment model to evaluate the impact of all diagnosed and all hospitalized on the epidemic trend of COVID-19, and explore innovative and effective releasing strategies for different age groups to prevent the second wave of COVID-19. Methods: Based on three types of COVID-19 data in New York City (NYC), we calibrated the model and estimated the unknown parameters using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Results: Compared with the current practice in NYC, we estimated that if all infected people were diagnosed from March 26, April 5 to April 15, 2020, respectively, then the number of new infections on April 22 was reduced by 98.02, 93.88, and 74.08%. If all confirmed cases were hospitalized from March 26, April 5, and April 15, 2020, respectively, then as of June 7, 2020, the total number of deaths in NYC was reduced by 67.24, 63.43, and 51.79%. When only the 0–17 age group in NYC was released from June 8, if the contact rate in this age group remained below 61% of the pre-pandemic level, then a second wave of COVID-19 could be prevented in NYC. When both the 0–17 and 18–44 age groups in NYC were released from June 8, if the contact rates in these two age groups maintained below 36% of the pre-pandemic level, then a second wave of COVID-19 could be prevented in NYC. Conclusions: If all infected people were diagnosed in time, the daily number of new infections could be significantly reduced in NYC. If all confirmed cases were hospitalized in time, the total number of deaths could be significantly reduced in NYC. Keeping a social distance and relaxing lockdown restrictions for people between the ages of 0 and 44 could not lead to a second wave of COVID-19 in NYC.","Li, Miaolei; Zu, Jian; Li, Zongfang; Shen, Mingwang; Li, Yan; Ji, Fanpu",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485318/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.641205,150

However, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. We investigated the effects of the two zinc salts, zinc chloride (ZnCl(2)) and zinc sulfate (ZnSO(4)), on infection of swine testicle (ST) cells with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and compared it to the effects of a control salt, magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)). Virus yield reduction experiments showed that ZnCl(2) and ZnSO(4) did not exhibit direct virucidal effects and did not affect adsorption of TGEV to ST cells. However, ZnCl(2) and ZnSO(4) markedly reduced viral titers as well as TGEV RNA and viral protein synthesis when applied during virus penetration and at different time points after viral cell entry. The results of the study suggest that zinc salts do not interfere with TGEV-cell binding but that they mediate antiviral effects through inhibition of viral penetration or egress or the intracellular phase of the viral life-cycle.","Wei, Zhanyong; Burwinkel, Michael; Palissa, Christiane; Ephraim, Eden; Schmidt, Michael F.G.",Vet Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.06.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113512003719; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113512003719; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22818659/,150

SARS-CoV-2) continue to be reported. Very recent findings reveal that 20–30% of patients at high risk of mortality from COVID-19 infection experience blood clotting that leads to stroke and sudden death. Timely assessment of the severity of blood clotting will be of enormous help to clinicians in determining the right blood-thinning medications to prevent stroke or other life-threatening consequences. Therefore, rapid identification of blood-clotting-related proteins in the plasma of COVID-19 patients would save many lives. Several nanotechnology-based approaches are being developed to diagnose patients at high risk of death due to complications from COVID-19 infections, including blood clots. This Perspective outlines (i) the significant potential of nanomedicine in assessing the risk of blood clotting and its severity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and (ii) its synergistic roles with advanced mass-spectrometry-based proteomics approaches in identifying the important protein patterns that are involved in the occurrence and progression of this disease.

The primary objective of this study was to compare the total number of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) Refresher (ER) course completions during 2020 versus prior years. Secondary outcomes examined in person versus on-line/distributive learning during the study period. METHODS: The Commission on Accreditation for Prehospital Continuing Education (CAPCE) is the only national organization that accredits continuing education (CE) for paramedics and EMTs and currently has a database with over 14 million CE records. The total number of ER course completions each month in 2020 were compared to 2019 and 2018. We also compared the different educational format types: live in-person (LIP), asynchronous on-line distributive learning (DL), and virtual instructor lead training (VILT) synchronous DL courses. Data was analyzed using descriptive and two-way ANOVA statistics. RESULTS: There were 1,922,783 ER course completions in 2020 versus 1,166,335 in 2019 and 1,074,636 in 2018, representing a 179% increase during the study period. Asynchronous DL course completions in 2020 were 1,830,513 EMS versus 1,078,580 in 2019 and 987,749 in 2018 a 185% increase over the three-year study period. Asynchronous DL monthly means by year was statistically significant, F(2, 99) = 95.632, p < .001. Mean monthly LIP and VLIT educational deliveries by year were not significantly different, p = .802, p = .754, respectively. Total LIP course completions in 2020 were 20,045 versus 51,552 in 2019 and 63,058 in 2018. In 2020 LIP courses made up only 1.0% (20,045/1,922,783) of all ER completions. This study was limited to only EMS professionals taking ER course completions in the CAPCE database. However EMS is not unique, since previous research has suggested that DL has flourished in other health care disciplines while LIP courses have continued to decrease. CONCLUSION: This large nationwide study of EMS profession has shown the trend towards DL education and a trend away from LIP courses. Future studies should examine the advantages and disadvantages of DL education.","March, J A; Scott, J; Camarillo, N; Bailey, S; Holley, J E; Taylor, S E",Prehosp Emerg Care,https://doi.org/10.1080/10903127.2021.1977876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34554896/,150

In this paper, the integrated management of HCWs in Wuhan, the first COVID-19-outbreaking city with over ten millions of people completely locking down, was collected, investigated and analyzed. During the pandemic, municipal solid wastes (MSWs) from designated hospitals, Fangcang shelter hospitals, isolation locations and residential areas (e.g. face masks) were collected and categorized as HCWs due to the high infectiousness and strong survivability of COVID-19, and accordingly the average production of HCWs per 1000 persons in Wuhan explosively increased from 3.64 kg/d to 27.32 kg/d. Segregation, collection, storage, transportation and disposal of HCWs in Wuhan were discussed and outlined. Stationary facilities, mobile facilities, co-processing facilities (Incineration plants for MSWs) and nonlocal disposal were consecutively utilized to improve the disposal capacity, from 50 tons/d to 280.1 tons/d. Results indicated that stationary and co-processing facilities were preferential for HCWs disposal, while mobile facilities and nonlocal disposal acted as supplementary approaches. Overall, the improved system of HCWs management could meet the challenge of the explosive growth of HCWs production during COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan. Furthermore, these practices could provide a reference for other densely populated metropolises.","Yang, Lie; Yu, Xiao; Wu, Xiaolong; Wang, Jia; Yan, Xiaoke; Jiang, Shen; Chen, Zhuqi",Resour Conserv Recycl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834492/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0921344920303918; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105074; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344920303918?v=s5,150
631921,Medicinal Plants,2021-07-02,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causal agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To date, viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in four bat species: Rhinolophus acuminatus, Rhinolophus affinis, Rhinolophus malayanus, and Rhinolophus shameli. Here, we analysed 343 sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (CO1) from georeferenced bats of the four Rhinolophus species identified as reservoirs of viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Haplotype networks were constructed in order to investigate patterns of genetic diversity among bat populations of Southeast Asia and China. No strong geographic structure was found for the four Rhinolophus species, suggesting high dispersal capacity. The ecological niche of bat viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 was predicted using the four localities in which bat viruses were recently discovered and the localities where bats showed the same CO1 haplotypes than virus-positive bats. The ecological niche of bat viruses related to SARS-CoV was deduced from the localities where bat viruses were previously detected. The results show that the ecological niche of bat viruses related to SARS-CoV2 includes several regions of mainland Southeast Asia whereas the ecological niche of bat viruses related to SARS-CoV is mainly restricted to China. In agreement with these results, human populations in Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand appear to be much less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than other countries of Southeast Asia. In the climatic transitional zone between the two ecological niches (southern Yunnan, northern Laos, northern Vietnam), genomic recombination between highly divergent viruses is more likely to occur. Considering the limited data and the risk of recombinant bat-CoVs emergence as the source of new pandemics in humans, the bat populations in these regions should be under surveillance.","Hassanin, Alexandre; Tu, Vuong Tan; Curaudeau, Manon; Csorba, Gabor",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93738-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34253798/,150

The use of appropriate surveillance systems ensures timely information management for effective planning and response to infectious diseases threats during the pilgrimage. The literature describes infectious diseases prevention and control strategies for Hajj but with limited information on the operations and characteristics of the existing Hajj infectious diseases surveillance systems. Method: We reviewed documents, including guidelines and reports from the Saudi Ministry of Health’s database, to describe the characteristics of the infectious diseases surveillance systems that were operational during the 2015 Hajj, highlighting best practices and gaps and proposing strategies for strengthening and improvement. Using Pubmed and Embase online search engines and a combination of search terms including, ‘mass gatherings’ ‘Olympics’ ‘surveillance’ ‘Hajj’ ‘health security’, we explored the existing literature and highlighted some lessons learnt from other international mass gatherings. Results: A regular indicator-based infectious disease surveillance system generates routine reports from health facilities within the Kingdom to the regional and central public health directorates all year round. During Hajj, enhanced indicator-based notifiable diseases surveillance systems complement the existing surveillance tool to ensure timely reporting of event information for appropriate action by public health officials. Conclusion: There is need to integrate the existing Hajj surveillance data management systems and to implement syndromic surveillance as an early warning system for infectious disease control during Hajj. International engagement is important to strengthen Hajj infectious diseases surveillance and to prevent disease transmission and globalization of infectious agents which could undermine global health security.","Alotaibi, Badriah M.; Yezli, Saber; Bin Saeed, Abdul-Aziz A.; Turkestani, Abdulhafeez; Alawam, Amnah H.; Bieh, Kingsley L.",J Travel Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taw087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28355612/,150

This inhibition of HIV-1 spread strictly requires PMN contact with infected cells and is not mediated by soluble factors. 2-Photon (2PM) imaging visualized contacts of PMNs with HIV-1-infected CD4 T cells in tonsil tissue that do not result in lysis or uptake of infected cells. The anti-HIV activity of PMNs also does not involve degranulation, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, or integrin-dependent cell communication. These results reveal that PMNs efficiently blunt HIV-1 replication in primary target cells and tissue by an unconventional mechanism.","Reif, Tatjana; Dyckhoff, Gerhard; Hohenberger, Ralph; Kolbe, Carl-Christian; Gruell, Henning; Klein, Florian; Latz, Eicke; Stolp, Bettina; Fackler, Oliver T.",Cell Rep Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195682/,150

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a survey of attending physician members of the Society for Pediatric Radiology in North America from April 27, 2020, to May 22, 2020. The response rate was 21% (251/1,206). Survey questions included demographic information and questions regarding working remotely, personal protective equipment, redeployment, personal wellness, wellness resources and financial concerns. A psychometrician reviewed the questions to ensure minimal risk of misinterpretation. RESULTS: Median age of respondents was 48 years (range 33–70 years) with median number of years in practice of 14 (range 1–45 years). Fifty-three percent of respondents were women and 46% were men. Because of an increase in remote work, 69% of respondents endorsed feeling more isolated from a lack of regular interaction with colleagues. Fifty-three percent of respondents indicated that it is challenging to work remotely while overseeing home schooling for children. In comparison to men, women reported overall higher work-related stress and anxiety (P=0.02), higher feelings of guilt from radiology staff (i.e. technologists and nurses) being more exposed to COVID-19 (P=0.02) and higher levels of stress providing for dependents (P=0.04). Most respondents thought that departmental leadership was effective and respondents were not concerned about meeting financial obligations or job loss. CONCLUSION: The early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic caused additional stress and anxiety for pediatric radiology faculty and disproportionally affected women. Given the continuously evolving state of the COVID-19 pandemic, these results could aid in planning and implementation of future strategies to combat burnout in radiology. Specific attention should be directed to different stressors experienced by female versus male radiologists, especially in regard to dependent care.

This is partly because of inconsistencies in testing and death reporting standards across countries. Our purpose is to provide accurate estimates which do not rely on testing and death count data directly but only use population level statistics. Methods: We collected demographic and death records data from the Italian Institute of Statistics. We focus on the area in Italy that experienced the initial outbreak of COVID-19 and estimated a Bayesian model fitting age-stratified mortality data from 2020 and previous years. We also assessed the sensitivity of our estimates to alternative assumptions on the proportion of population infected. Findings: We estimate an overall infection fatality rate of 1.29% (95% credible interval [CrI] 0.89 - 2.01), as well as large differences by age, with a low infection fatality rate of 0.05% for under 60 year old (CrI 0-.19) and a substantially higher 4.25% (CrI 3.01-6.39) for people above 60 years of age. In our sensitivity analysis, we found that even under extreme assumptions, our method delivered useful information. For instance, even if only 10% of the population were infected, the infection fatality rate would not rise above 0.2% for people under 60. Interpretation: Our empirical estimates based on population level data show a sharp difference in fatality rates between young and old people and firmly rule out overall fatality ratios below 0.5% in populations with more than 30% over 60 years old.","Rinaldi, Gianluca; Paradisi, Matteo",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.18.20070912v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.18.20070912,150
638228,Editorial: Animal Models of Stress - Current Knowledge and Potential Directions,2021-02-16,"COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 pathogenesis causes vascular-mediated neurological disorders via still elusive mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a transmembrane receptor that recognizes the viral spike (S) protein. Brain pericytes were recently shown to express ACE2 at the neurovascular interface, outlining their possible implication in microvasculature injury in COVID-19. Yet, pericyte responses to SARS-CoV-2 is still to be fully elucidated. Using cell-based assays, we report that ACE2 expression in human brain vascular pericytes is highly dynamic and is increased upon S protein stimulation. Pericytes exposed to S protein underwent profound phenotypic changes translated by increased expression of contractile and myofibrogenic proteins, namely α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibronectin, collagen I, and neurogenic locus notch homolog protein-3 (NOTCH3). These changes were associated to an altered intracellular calcium (Ca2+) dynamic. Furthermore, S protein induced lipid peroxidation, oxidative and nitrosative stress in pericytes as well as triggered an immune reaction translated by activation of nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) signalling pathway, which was potentiated by hypoxia, a condition associated to vascular comorbidities, which exacerbate COVID-19 pathogenesis. S protein exposure combined to hypoxia enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in immune cell activation and trafficking, namely interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-18, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). Finally, we found that S protein could reach the mouse brain via the intranasal route and that reactive ACE2-expressing pericytes are recruited to the damaged tissue undergoing fibrotic scarring in a mouse model of cerebral multifocal micro-occlusions, a main reported vascular-mediated neurological condition associated to COVID-19. Our data demonstrate that the released S protein is sufficient to mediate pericyte immunoreactivity, which may contribute to microvasculature injury in absence of a productive viral infection. Our study provides a better understanding for the possible mechanisms underlying cerebrovascular disorders in COVID-19, paving the way to develop new therapeutic interventions.","Khaddaj-Mallat, Rayan; Aldib, Natija; Paquette, Anne-Sophie; Ferreira, Aymeric; Lecordier, Sarah; Bernard, Maxime; Saghatelyan, Armen; ElAli, Ayman",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.30.442194,150

DESIGN: RCT using two cohorts of HCWs of four NICUs each, to improve HCW well-being (primary outcome: burnout). Cohort 1 received WISER while Cohort 2 acted as a waitlist control. RESULTS: Cohorts were similar, mostly female (83%) and nurses (62%). In Cohorts 1 and 2 respectively, 182 and 299 initiated WISER, 100 and 176 completed 1-month follow-up, and 78 and 146 completed 6-month follow-up. Relative to control, WISER decreased burnout (−5.27 (95% CI: −10.44, −0.10), p = 0.046). Combined adjusted cohort results at 1-month showed that the percentage of HCWs reporting concerning outcomes was significantly decreased for burnout (−6.3% (95%CI: −11.6%, −1.0%); p = 0.008), and secondary outcomes depression (−5.2% (95%CI: −10.8, −0.4); p = 0.022) and work-life integration (−11.8% (95%CI: −17.9, −6.1); p < 0.001). Improvements endured at 6 months. CONCLUSION: WISER appears to durably improve HCW well-being.

638468,Bacterial Diseases,2018-11-23,"COVID-19 can evolve to a severe lung compromise with life-threatening hypoxemia. The mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Their understanding is crucial to improve the outcomes. Initially, past-experience lead to the implementation of standardized protocols assuming this disease would be the same as SARS-CoV. Impulsive use of ventilators in extreme cases ended up in up to 88% fatality. We compare medical and physiological high altitude acute and chronic hypoxia experience with COVID-19 hypoxemia. A pathophysiological analysis is performed based on literature review and histopathological findings. Application of the Tolerance to Hypoxia formula = Hemoglobin/PaCO(2) + 3.01 to COVID-19, enlightens its critical hypoxemia. Pneumolysis is defined as progressive alveolar-capillary destruction resulting from the CoV-2 attack to pneumocytes. The adequate interpretation of the histopathological lung biopsy photomicrographs reveals these alterations. The three theoretical pathophysiological stages of progressive hypoxemia (silent hypoxemia, gasping, and death zone) are described. At high altitude, normal low oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) levels (with intact lung tissue and adequate acid–base status) could be considered silent hypoxemia. At sea level, in COVID-19, the silent hypoxemia starting at SpO(2) ≤ 90% (comparable to a normal SPO(2) {88–92%} at 3500 m) suddenly evolves to critical hypoxemia. This, as a consequence of progressive pneumolysis + inflammation + overexpressed immunity + HAPE-type edema resulting in pulmonary shunting. The proposed treatment is based on the improvement of the Tolerance to Hypoxia (Hemoglobin factor), oxygen therapy, inflammation reduction, antibiotics, antitussives, rehydration & anticoagulation if required. Understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 may assist in this disease's management.","Zubieta-Calleja, Gustavo; Zubieta-DeUrioste, Natalia",Indian J Clin Biochem,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12291-020-00935-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33191989/,150

641153,Computational Psychiatry Needs Time and Context.,2021-09-27,"INTRODUCTION: Telemedicine video visits are an under-utilized form of delivering health care. However due to the COVID-19 pandemic, practices are rapidly adapting telemedicine for patient care. We describe our experience in rapidly introducing video visits in a tertiary academic pediatric urology practice, serving primarily rural patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to assess visit success rate and identify barriers to completing video visits. The secondary aim identified types of pathologies feasible for video visits and travel time saved. We hypothesize socioeconomic status is a predictor of a successful visit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was prospectively collected and analyzed on video visits focusing on visit success, defined by satisfactory completion of the visit as assessed by the provider. Other variables collected included duration, video platform and technical problems. Retrospective data was collected via chart review and analyzed including demographics, insurance, and distance to care. Socioeconomic status was estimated using the Distressed Communities Index generated for patient zip code. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Out of 116 attempted visits, 81% were successful. The top two reasons for failure were “no-show” (64%) and inability to connect (14%). Success versus failure of visit was similar for patient age (p=0.23), sex (p=0.42), type of visit (initial vs. established) (p=0.51), and socioeconomic status (p = 0.39). After adjusting for race, socioeconomic status, and type of provider, having public insurance remained a significant predictor of failure (p = 0.017). Successful visits were conducted on multiple common pediatric urologic problems (excluding visits requiring palpation on exam), and video was sufficient for physical exams in most cases (Summary Table). A median of 2.25 hours of travel time was saved. CONCLUSIONS: While socioeconomic status, estimated using the Distressed Communities Index, did not predict success of video visits, patients with public insurance were more likely to have a failed video visit. There is compelling evidence that effective video visits for certain pathologies can be rapidly achieved in a pediatric urology practice with minimal preparation time.","Winkelman, Andrew J.; Beller, Haerin L.; Morgan, Kathryn E.; Corbett, Sean T.; Leroy, Susan V.; Noona, Sean W.; Berry, Kaitlin L.; Kern, Nora G.",J Pediatr Urol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpurol.2020.09.028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477513120305581; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477513120305581?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33077389/,150

643175,Consider expenditure controls’ impacts on equity,2021-05-29,"Across the world, challenges for clinicians providing health care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are highly prevalent and have been widely reported. Perspectives of provider groups have conveyed wide-ranging experiences of adversity, distress, and resilience. In understanding and responding to the emotional and psychological implications of the pandemic for renal clinicians, it is vital to recognize that many experiences also have been ethically challenging. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted rapid and extensive transformation of health care systems and widely impacted care provision, heightening the risk of barriers to fulfillment of ethical duties. Given this, it is likely that some clinicians also have experienced moral distress, which can occur if an individual is unable to act in accordance with their moral judgment owing to external barriers. This review presents a global perspective of potential experiences of moral distress in kidney care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using nephrology cases, we discuss why moral distress may be experienced by health professionals when withholding or withdrawing potentially beneficial treatments owing to resource constraints, when providing care that is inconsistent with local prepandemic best practice standards, and when managing dual professional and personal roles with conflicting responsibilities. We argue that in addition to responsive and appropriate health system supports, resources, and education, it is imperative for health care providers to recognize and prevent moral distress to foster the psychological well-being and moral resilience of clinicians during extended periods of crisis within health systems.","Ducharlet, Kathryn; Trivedi, Mayuri; Gelfand, Samantha L; Liew, Hui; McMahon, Lawrence P; Ashuntantang, Gloria; Brennan, Frank; Brown, Mark; Martin, Dominique E",Seminars in nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semnephrol.2021.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34330365/,150

Thus, analyzing the viral diversity harbored by rodents could assist efforts to predict and reduce the risk of future emergence of zoonotic viral diseases. RESULTS: We used next-generation sequencing metagenomic analysis to survey for a range of mammalian viral families in rodents and other small animals of the orders Rodentia, Lagomorpha, and Soricomorpha in China. We sampled 3,055 small animals from 20 provinces and then outlined the spectra of mammalian viruses within these individuals and the basic ecological and genetic characteristics of novel rodent and shrew viruses among the viral spectra. Further analysis revealed that host taxonomy plays a primary role and geographical location plays a secondary role in determining viral diversity. Many viruses were reported for the first time with distinct evolutionary lineages, and viruses related to known human or animal pathogens were identified. Phylogram comparison between viruses and hosts indicated that host shifts commonly happened in many different species during viral evolutionary history. CONCLUSIONS: These results expand our understanding of the viromes of rodents and insectivores in China and suggest that there is high diversity of viruses awaiting discovery in these species in Asia. These findings, combined with our previous bat virome data, greatly increase our knowledge of the viral community in wildlife in a densely populated country in an emerging disease hotspot.

Longevity is reflected by life expectancy, and healthy aging is reflected by healthy life expectancy; high values of these indicators reflect good conditions of living for people. Life expectancy and healthy life expectancy analyses are of big interest among academics, policymakers, medical researchers, and others in order to direct the flow of funds in the most effective way possible to the population groups in most need. High life expectancy and low birth rate will lead to aging of the population, having profound implications on the school age population, politics, healthcare, labor force, social protection, social security issues, and public finances. Healthy life expectancy reflects health conditions, including the impacts of mortality and morbidity. As cardiovascular disease causes more than half of all deaths across Europe, this paper examines the influence of cardiovascular disease on longevity and healthy aging across Europe. The methodology was chosen so as to test the research hypotheses: (a) principal component analysis provided the socio-economic factors that are correlated to longevity and healthy aging; (b) regression analysis identified the relationship between healthy aging and cardiovascular disease; and (c) hierarchical cluster analysis allowed us to find common features of the groups of countries according to healthy aging and longevity.","Apostu, Simona-Andreea; Vasile, Valentina; Sava, Valentin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299677/,150

METHODS Patients who were hospitalized and treated for orthopedic treatment between 10 March and 1 June during the pandemic period were retrospectively analyzed. Control group consisted of patients admitted to the hospital in the same time interval in 2019. The patients were divided into three groups, under 20 years of age, between 20 and 65 years of age, and over 65 years of age. The patients' data included age, gender, trauma mechanism, fracture type, and any COVID-19 radiological or clinical symptoms. RESULTS The number of patients >65-years-old admitted to the orthopedic trauma center was high at pandemic intervals compared to pre-pandemic time. When the groups were compared for patients of 20-65-years-old; there was a significant difference for the fracture type (p<0.05). Lower extremity fractures were high at pre-pandemic group, whereas multiple traumas were high at pandemic group. For sub-group 20-65 ages, low-energy traumas were higher at pre-pandemic group, whereas high-energy traumas were more frequent at the pandemic group. CONCLUSION We observed a decrease in fracture admission to orthopedic trauma centers during COVID-19 pandemic for subgroups of <20-years-old and 20-65-years-old ages, whereas there was a significant increase for >65-years-old age, most of them related to the osteoporotic hip fractures.

Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China. Methods: We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification. Results: We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days--4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4--9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification. Conclusions: Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates.","Zhao, Qingyuan; Chen, Yang; Small, Dylan S",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020941,150

A short review,2020-10-06,"Introduction The novel coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19, was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019. Since that time, medical services in Saudi Arabia have adapted to the situation by delivering medical care via virtual clinics. Therefore, the aim of the study is to assess physicians' perception and the level of satisfaction with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Methods This was a cross-sectional study that included family medicine consultants and fellows who had used telemedicine in primary health care centers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It was conducted using an online validated questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 219 family medicine consultants and fellows, after obtaining their informed consent. The data that were extracted from the questionnaire included demographics, level of satisfaction, and questions related to their experience with telemedicine. Results Two hundred and nineteen participants enrolled in this study with 50.6% males and 49.4% females. The overall level of physicians’ satisfaction with telemedicine was 64.3%. However, only one-third preferred telemedicine over office visits. Of these, 60% were males and 40% were females. The only factor that had a statistically significant effect on the preference of office visits or telemedicine was time efficiency (p-value < 0.001). Of those who preferred office visits over telemedicine, 52% of them cited ease of discussion and the ability to make a comprehensive physical examination as the most important reasons for choosing office visits. Technologic issues were the least important factor for choosing either clinic (4.1%). Of those who preferred telemedicine, avoiding contact with patients suspected of COVID-19 was the most commonly cited factor (27.4%). Family medicine physicians face multiple barriers while using telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most commonly cited barrier was the inability to make a full and comprehensive assessment of the patient. Conclusions In the setting of highly transmissible disease epidemics, telemedicine has a lot of potential for providing quick and safe care that is appropriate for screening and management. Based on our findings, using telemedicine should be encouraged by improving physicians’ skills in this field since telemedicine is a crucial step to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission and provide community-wide treatment.","Altulaihi, Bader A; Alharbi, Khalid G; Alhassan, Abdulrahman M; Altamimi, Abdullah M; Al Akeel, Mouneera A",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350074/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16107,150
645303,Changing Role of Nursing Cadre under Emerging Zoonotic Diseases,2020-03-11,"INTRODUCTION: The current pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is unparalleled in recent history as are the social distancing interventions that have led to a considerable halt on the economic and social life of so many countries. AIM: We aimed to generate empirical evidence about which social distancing measures had the most impact in reducing case counts and mortality. METHODS: We report a quasi-experimental (observational) study of the impact of various interventions for control of the outbreak through 24 April 2020. Chronological data on case numbers and deaths were taken from the daily published figures by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and dates of initiation of various control strategies from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation website and published sources. Our complementary analyses were modelled in R using Bayesian generalised additive mixed models and in STATA using multilevel mixed-effects regression models. RESULTS: From both sets of modelling, we found that closure of education facilities, prohibiting mass gatherings and closure of some non-essential businesses were associated with reduced incidence whereas stay-at-home orders and closure of additional non-essential businesses was not associated with any independent additional impact. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are that schools and some non-essential businesses operating ‘as normal’ as well as allowing mass gatherings were incompatible with suppressing disease spread. Closure of all businesses and stay at home orders are less likely to be required to keep disease incidence low. Our results help identify what were the most effective non-pharmaceutical interventions in this period.","Hunter, Paul R; Colón-González, Felipe J; Brainard, Julii; Rushton, Steven",Euro Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2021.26.28.2001401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34269173/,150
645324,The Search for a Single Vaccine Against Coronaviruses Yet to Come,2021,"Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) is widely used in national vaccination programs worldwide. It is accepted that BCG alleviates both pathogen and allergy induced respiratory diseases that could also include Covid-19. To investigate this possibility, we randomly assigned 60 Covid-19 patients, after admission to the hospital with pneumonia and requirement for oxygen therapy in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a single adult dose of intradermal BCG or normal saline with concomitant standard of care (SoC) medications. Primary endpoints were favorable prognosis of Covid-19 as deduced from resolution of pneumonia, viremia and secondary outcome were enumeration of ICU admissions, duration thereof and mortalities. Results Both primary and secondary endpoints were significantly improved in the BCG+SoC group. This could be seen from reduction in oxygen requirement due to Covid-19 associated pneumonia decreasing from day 3-4, improved radiological resolution from day 7-15. There were a total of 6 (10%) adverse events in the study of which 2 deaths and 4 ICU admissions were in SoC group (1 ICU admission culminated in death of the subject) and in contrast only 1 ICU admission in the BCG+SoC group. While there was an increase in Covid-19 specific IgG levels in the BCG+SoC group, there was no evidence of BCG induced cytokine storm in this group. Four patients showed localized inflammatory response at the injection site in the BCG+SoC group. Conclusions BCG+SoC administration resulted in a significantly higher percentage of patients with favorable outcomes than did SoC. A third of the patients were naive for childhood BCG vaccination. This mimicked elderly patients in countries with no universal vaccination policy for BCG. No BCG related adversity was seen in this group. The study shows that BCG is a safe, cost-effective treatment that can be introduced as a standard of care in patients with moderate Covid-19 that can reduce requirement of oxygen supplemented beds and disease burden in low resource countries, with additional long-term benefits of reducing risk for tuberculosis.","Padmanabhan, U.; Mukherjee, S.; Borse, R.; Joshi, S.; Deshmukh, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.28.20221630v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221630,150

Since the first SARS-CoV-2 sequences identified from samples collected in December 2019, the virus has been evolving. Now, in the GISAID database of SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of March 17, 2021, 95.7% (758,684 of 792,388) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has the D614G mutation in the spike protein gene; and 22% (178,186 of 792.388) had N501Y mutation which occurred in the more virulent UK variants, South Africa variant and Brazil variant. Large number of minks were infected with the virus which containing the Y453F mutation in Europe, causing zoonosis concerns. To evaluate the genetic characteristics of the US mink-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we analyzed all animal-derived (977), all Canadian (19,529) and US (173,277) SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited in GISAID from December 2019 to March 12, 2021, and identified 2 dominant novel variants, the N501T-G142D variant and N501T-G142D-F486L variant, in the US mink-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These variants were not found in minks from Canada or other countries. The Y453F mutation was not identified in the mink-derive sequences in the US and Canada. The N501T mutation occurred two months earlier in the human than in the minks in the US. The results of our study highlighted the importance of on going monitoring the mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in animals.","Cai, H.

An evidence based symptom criteria for identifying heath care workers (HCW) for testing, based on the probability of positive COVID‐19 test results, would allow for a more appropriate use of testing resources. METHODS: This was an observational study of outpatient COVID‐19 testing of HCW. Prior to testing, HCW were asked about the presence of 10 symptoms. Their responses were then compared to their subsequent pharyngeal swab COVID‐19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test results. These data were used to derive and evaluate a symptom based testing criteria. RESULTS: 961 HCW were included in the analysis, of which 225 (23%) had positive test results. Loss of taste or smell was the symptom with the largest positive likelihood ratio (3.33). Dry cough, regardless of the presence or absence of other symptoms, was the most sensitive (74%) and the least specific (32%) symptom. The existing testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of three symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, dry cough) was 93% sensitive and 9% specific (AUC = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.59 – 0.67). The derived testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of two symptoms (fever, loss of taste or smell) was 89% sensitive and 48% specific (AUC = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.71 – 0.78). The hybrid testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of four symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, dry cough, loss of taste or smell) was 98% sensitive and 8% specific (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.73 – 0.80). CONCLUSION: An evidence based approach to COVID‐19 testing which at least includes fever and loss of taste or smell should be utilized when determining which HCW should be tested.","Clemency, Brian M; Varughese, Renoj; Scheafer, Danielle K; Ludwig, Brian; Welch, Jacob V; McCormack, Robert F; Ma, Changxing; Nan, Nan; Giambra, Theresa; Raab, Thomas",Acad Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396670/; https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14009,150

The objective of this study was to evaluate cardiac involvement in previously healthy children with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed a cohort of 53 paediatric patients (29 males, 55%), mean age 7.5 ± 4.7 years, who had a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and were asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic for COVID-19. Patients underwent standard transthoracic echocardiogram and speckle tracking echocardiographic study at least 3 months after diagnosis. Thirty-two age, sex, and body surface area comparable healthy subjects were used as control group. Left ventricular ejection fraction was within normal limits but significantly lower in the cases group compared to controls (62.4 ± 4.1% vs. 65.2 ± 5.5%; P = 0.012). Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (20.1 ± 3 mm vs. 19.8 ± 3.4 mm; P = 0.822) and left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (-21.9 ± 2.4% vs. -22.6 ± 2.5%; P = 0.208) were comparable between the two groups. Regional LV strain analysis showed a significant reduction of the LV mid-wall segments strain among cases compared to controls. Furthermore, in the cases group, there were 14 subjects (26%) with a regional peak systolic strain below -16% (-2.5 Z score in our healthy cohort) in at least two segments. These subjects did not show any difference regarding symptoms or serological findings. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect left ventricular deformation in 26% of children despite an asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic acute illness. A follow-up is needed to verify the reversibility of these alterations and their impact on long-term outcomes.","Sirico, Domenico; Di Chiara, Costanza; Costenaro, Paola; Bonfante, Francesco; Cozzani, Sandra; Plebani, Mario; Reffo, Elena; Castaldi, Biagio; Donà, Daniele; Da Dalt, Liviana; Giaquinto, Carlo; Di Salvo, Giovanni",European heart journal.

We analyse available COVID-19 data at the regional (subnational) level to elucidate patterns and typology of Arctic regions with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article builds upon our previous research that examined the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic between February and July 2020. The pandemic’s “second wave” observed in the Arctic between September 2020 and January 2021 was severe in terms of COVID-19 infections and fatalities, having particularly strong impacts in Alaska, Northern Russia and Northern Sweden. Based on the spatiotemporal patterns of the “second wave” dynamics, we identified 5 types of the pandemic across regions: Shockwaves (Iceland, Faroe Islands, Northern Norway, and Northern Finland), Protracted Waves (Northern Sweden), Tidal Waves (Northern Russia), Tsunami Waves (Alaska), and Isolated Splashes (Northern Canada and Greenland). Although data limitations and gaps persist, monitoring of COVID-19 is critical for developing a proper understanding of the pandemic in order to develop informed and effective responses to the current crisis and possible future pandemics in the Arctic.

Illegal products of animal origin may contain hazardous infectious agents that can compromise animal and public health. The aim of this study was to identify associations between possession of illegal animal products in baggage and demographic characteristics of the passengers, as well as characteristics of their travel plans in the two main Brazilian international airports. A total of 457 passengers were divided into two groups: passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products and control. Passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products not stated on the accompanied baggage declaration completed a questionnaire, to aid in profiling. Nationality, origin, age and residency of passengers were analyzed using chi square, logistic regression and odds ratios. Passengers from Eastern Europe were the most likely to enter with animal products as were those aged between 35 and 55 years. When evaluating the departure point, the highest frequency was seen in those coming from Portugal. Passenger group, reasons for travel, amount and type of baggage were available only for passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products, noting that they prefer traveling alone, for leisure, bringing few bags. Such information can contribute to the early identification of passengers that have illegal animal products in baggage at Brazilian airports.","de Melo, Cristiano Barros; Pinheiro de Sá, Marcos Eielson; Alves, Flaviane Faria; McManus, Concepta; Aragão, Lucas Fernandes; Belo, Bruno Benin; Campani, Paulo Ricardo; da Matta Ribeiro, Antonio Cavalcanti; Seabra, Christina Isoldi; Seixas, Luiza",Springerplus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24567878/; https://doi.org/10.1186/2193-1801-3-69,150

By reviewing and summarizing the different stages, nodes and measures during the occurrence and development of COVID-19, other countries can draw on their experience and reference for the fight against COVID-19 in China. In December 2019, the COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and then the whole world continued to pay close attention to the development of the COVID-19 in China. Until now, the outbreak and development of the COVID-19 has lasted for more than a year. Looking back on the process of the COVID-19, several key stages and events have had a profound impact on the development of the COVID-19. We divided the evolution of the outbreak since its origin into different phases. The policy changes of the Chinese government in different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated, and the transformation nodes of the policies and differences in each stage were determined. We divided the evolution of the outbreak into three stages of the outbreak are initial outbreak stage, the carrying of the virus (people or goods) stage, and the non-direct contact transmission (goods transmission) stage. This paper reviews the three stages of the evolution of responses by the Chinese government to COVID-19 using a phase analysis method to examine different policy starting points, changes to policy, and reasons for policy change. The study provides a resource for COVID-19 policy review and includes image of the three-phase shift in policy as the epidemic progressed. By summarizing and describing the policy changes in the three phases of the response to COVID-19 in China, this paper provides a resource for others in formulating their response to the pandemic.

Viruses are recognized as the predominant causative agents of acute respiratory infections. In Senegal, few data concerning the causes of respiratory infections are available, and those known relate mainly to classical influenza infections. Clinical and virological surveillance of acute respiratory infections was carried out in a rural community in children less than 5 years old. A standardized questionnaire was used and a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected from each patient. These samples were tested for the detection of 20 respiratory viruses by multiplex RT‐PCR or by viral culture. A total of 82 acute respiratory episodes were included, and 48 (58.5%) were found to be positive, with a total of 55 viral detections; several samples were positive for two (n = 5) or 3 (n = 1) viruses. Ten different viruses were identified: influenza viruses A, B, and C (n = 25), human respiratory syncytial virus type A (n = 13), rhinoviruses (n = 8), human coronaviruses type 229E and NL63 (n = 6), parainfluenza viruses 3 and 4 (n = 2), and bocavirus (n = 1). These results provide evidence on the importance and the diversity of viruses as causative agents of acute respiratory infections in children living in a rural community in Senegal. The establishment of sentinel surveillance sites could help estimate the burden of acute respiratory infection in the pediatric population and should help prepare the health care systems to identify and respond to new viral respiratory emergencies.

Human amnion epithelial cells (hAEC) have been used to treat monogenetic liver disease such as maple syrup urine disease or fibrosis of the liver in preclinical studies. In most studies xeno-transplants of hAEC were conducted without providing immunosuppression to recipients, reflecting the tolerogenic properties of hAEC. For many cell types, successful cryopreservation is critical for providing a readily available, off-the-shelf product. In this study, hAEC were isolated from full-term human placenta from 14 different donors, cryopreserved using a protocol and reagents commonly adopted for epithelial cell preservation. The cells were analyzed in terms of survival, recovery, and homogeneity, profiled for surface markers characteristic of epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial, or hematopoietic cells. There were no significant differences observed in the percentage of cells with epithelial cell markers before and after cryopreservation. The relative proportion of stromal and hematopoietic cells was significantly reduced in hAEC preparations after cryopreservation. The expression of stem cell and immunomodulatory molecules were confirmed in the final product. Since multipotent cells are readily available from full-term placenta, this novel cell source might significantly increase the number of patients eligible to receive cellular therapies for liver and other diseases.","Srinivasan, Raghuraman C.; Strom, Stephen C.; Gramignoli, Roberto",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9071696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32679793/,150

Both types of materials (nanopowders and nanofilms scratched off of the working electrode’s surface) have been characterized in detail by XRD, TEM, and Raman techniques. Inserting dopant ions into the TiO(2) structure has resulted in inhibition of crystal growth and prevention of phase transformation. The role of Zr(4+) ions in this process was explained by performing computer simulations. The three structures such as pure anatase, Zr-doped TiO(2), and tetragonal ZrO(2) have been investigated using density functional theory extended by Hubbard correction. The computational calculations correlate well with experimental results. Formation of defects and broadening of energy bandgap in defected Zr-doped materials have been confirmed. It turned out that the oxygen vacancies with substituting Zr(4+) ions in TiO(2) structure have a positive influence on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells. The overall photoconversion efficiency enhancement up to 8.63% by introducing 3.7% Zr(4+) ions into the TiO(2) has been confirmed by I-V curves, EIS, and IPCE measurements.

Biosensors, being hybrid devices composed by a biological receptor and a signal transducer, represent valuable alternatives to non biological analytical instruments because of the high specificity of the biomolecular recognition. The vast range of existing protein ligands enable those macromolecules to be used as efficient receptors to cover a diversity of applications. In addition, appropriate protein engineering approaches enable further improvement of the receptor functioning such as enhancing affinity or specificity in the ligand binding. Recently, several protein-only sensors are being developed, in which either both the receptor and signal transducer are parts of the same protein, or that use the whole cell where the protein is produced as transducer. In both cases, as no further chemical coupling is required, the production process is very convenient. However, protein platforms, being rather rigid, restrict the proper signal transduction that necessarily occurs through ligand-induced conformational changes. In this context, insertional protein engineering offers the possibility to develop new devices, efficiently responding to ligand interaction by dramatic conformational changes, in which the specificity and magnitude of the sensing response can be adjusted up to a convenient level for specific analyte species. In this report we will discuss the major engineering approaches taken for the designing of such instruments as well as the relevant examples of resulting protein-only biosensors.","Ferraz, Rosa María; Vera, Andrea; Arís, Anna; Villaverde, Antonio",Microb Cell Fact,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16584558/,150

PURPOSE To investigate sensor-derived physical activity and perceived health of people with PD during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the factors associated with these outcomes. METHODS Physical activity was measured over 7 days using the Actigraph GT3x accelerometer. Data were collected regarding perceived health status and physical activity habits, as well as rehabilitation attendance during the pandemic. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with physical activity and perceived changes in health. RESULTS Of 89 participants, a majority (67%) reported a pandemic-related reduction in exercise habits. Women more commonly reported a reduction in scheduled exercise and cancelled rehabilitation than men. Study participants took on average 5876 ± 3180 steps per day. In the multivariate analysis, female gender, being 70 years of age and older, and greater reported mobility problems were associated with being less physically active. A pandemic-induced deterioration in health was reported by 42% and women were 5 times more likely than men to do so (odds ratio: 5.12, 95% confidence interval, 1.87-15.03; P = 0.002). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Despite a pandemic-related reduction in reported exercise habits and rehabilitation, the participants in this Swedish sample were relatively physically active. However, women were less active at moderate-vigorous levels and were at greater risk of deterioration in perceived health during this time.See the video Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A359.","Leavy, Breiffni; Hagströmer, Maria; Conradsson, David Moulaee; Franzén, Erika",Journal of neurologic physical therapy : JNPT,https://doi.org/10.1097/npt.0000000000000372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369451/,150

Here, we demonstrate that tape sealing can improve visual field scores even when fogging artifacts are not obvious. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that visual field scores improve when the face masks are taped to prevent fogging artifacts. METHODS: A Single-center, randomized 2×2 cross-over study. Twenty-six visual fields of 13 patients of the glaucoma outpatient clinic were included. Patients were randomized in either sequence 1 (Octopus visual field examination without tape sealing, followed by examination with tape sealing) or sequence 2 (examination with, followed by without tape sealing). RESULTS: The results for mean defect and square root of loss variance differ significantly in the examination with and without tape sealing [mean difference (without−with) 0.39 dB, 95% confidence interval: 0.07-0.70 dB, P=0.018 and 0.49 dB, 95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.79 dB, P=0.003, respectively]. There was no sequence effect (P=0.967) for mean defect nor the square root of loss variance (P=0.779). A significant effect for period (P=0.023) for mean defect was yielded. CONCLUSION: Tape sealing of face masks during visual field testing prevented fogging artifacts and improved visual field scores even when fogging artifacts were not obvious and should be considered in clinical practice.","Heidinger, Astrid; Falb, Thomas; Werkl, Peter; List, Wolfgang; Hoeflechner, Lukas; Riedl, Regina; Ivastinovic, Domagoj; Hommer, Anton; Lindner, Ewald",J Glaucoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34387258/; https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001922,150

648979,Exposure and Aversion to Human Transmissible Diseases Predict Conservative Ideological and Partisan Preferences,2021-04-03,"Study Objectives: COVID-19 first emerged as an unknown respiratory virus in late 2019. Since the onset of the pandemic, the question of racial differences has been at the forefront of prognostic thought in determination of high-risk groups. Limited data is currently available about racial differences in symptoms of COVID-19. This research performed a retrospective data collection of patients in a hospital system in North Louisiana to determine if there was a statistical difference in presenting symptoms based on race. Methods: A total of 410 unique Medical Record Numbers (MRNs) were identified retrospectively. Data was collected from a mix of rapid and regular PCR nasal swabs collected from 4/1/2020 to 4/30/2020. Data collected included symptoms, race, ethnicity, occupation, sex and age. Symptoms were collected from their chief complaint, HPI, review of systems as well as nursing evaluation. Similar symptoms expressed in different wording were collapsed into larger categories. The rpart algorithm was used to perform association rule mining in both uncollapsed and collapsed data. Results: Black patients were the most represented race (74%) in our study. 399 patients were admitted with COVID-19 in April 2020. In Black patients, 306 were admitted (76.692%) compared to 79 White patients (19.799%). There were also significant differences on the basis of race between both the number of “typical” symptoms (Black=2.925 +- 2.067, White=2.367 +- 2.014, p=0.0330) and the more general “collapsed” categories of atypical symptoms (Black=1.036 +- 0.765, White=0.823 +- 0.844, p=0.026), but not concerning the number of atypical symptoms more specifically associated with COVID-19 (Black=0.428 +- 0.770, White=0.468 +- 0.749, p=0.589). This is concordant with our association rule mining results, which indicated that in Black patients, fever was frequently associated with myalgias, cough, and shortness of breath (lift=1.897) Conclusion: While evaluating the racial distribution of COVID-19 as it pertained to symptoms, Black patients were statistically more affected by COVID-19 in North Louisiana. Blacks make up 38% of the region's population but were 74% of the region’s COVID-19 cases. This was not observed in South Louisiana. Additionally, Black patients were more likely to be admitted than their White counterparts and were likely to have both more typical and atypical symptoms at presentation. Further investigation into the corresponding factors such as issues like weight, comorbid conditions, and genetic polymorphisms for ACE-I tropism should be explored to illuminate the proposed racial selection that SARS2-COVID-19 demonstrates for those of African descent.","Janese, D.; Cornelius, A.

649146,Incorporating Time Delays in the Mathematical Modelling of the Human Immune Response in Viral Infections,2021-12-31,"In late December 2019, the first case of an emerging coronavirus was identified in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, in mainland China. The novel virus appears to be highly contagious and is rapidly spreading worldwide, becoming a pandemic. The disease is causing a high toll of deaths. Effective public health responses to a new infectious disease are expected to mitigate and counteract its negative impact on the population. However, time and economic-financial constraints, as well as uncertainty, can jeopardize the answer. The aim of the present paper was to discuss the role of Universal Health Coverage to counteract the economic impact of the COVID-19 infection. Appropriate financing of the health system and ensuring equitable access to health services for all can, indeed, protect individuals against high medical costs, which is one of the most important goals of any health system. Financing profoundly affects the performance of the health system, and any policy that the health system decides to implement or not directly depends on the amount of available funding. Developed countries are injecting new funding to cope with the disease and prevent its further transmission. In addition to psychological support and increased societal engagement for the prevention, control, and treatment of COVID-19, extensive financial support to governments by the community should be considered. Developed and rich countries should support countries that do not have enough financial resources. This disease cannot be controlled and contained without international cooperation. The experience of the COVID-19 should be a lesson for further establishing and achieving universal health coverage in all countries. In addition to promoting equity in health, appropriate infrastructure should be strengthened to address these crises. Governments should make a stronger political commitment to fully implement this crucial set of policies and plans.","BEHZADIFAR, MASOUD; IMANI-NASAB, MOHAMMAD-HASAN; MARTINI, MARIANO; GHANBARI, MAHBOUBEH KHATON; BAKHTIARI, AHAD; BRAGAZZI, NICOLA LUIGI",J Prev Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33628955/; https://doi.org/10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2020.61.4.1581,150
649308,Regional deposition of the allergens and micro-aerosols in the healthy human nasal airways,2020-10-19,"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, many outpatient services at public hospitals, including diabetes services, had adopted telehealth appointments for their clinic patients. There was concern that patients’ glycaemic control may worsen during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with diabetes managed by telehealth consultations over 5 months at two metropolitan hospitals in Sydney. Their attendance rate, glycaemic control and unplanned admissions to hospital were assessed, and these were compared to the same period 12 months prior, when patients were reviewed via face‐to‐face appointments. RESULTS: Between April and September 2020, attendance rate for telehealth consultation at the diabetes services at the two hospitals was 88.9% (884 out of 994) in 2020, which was higher than in 2019 (85.2%, 818 out of 959, p = 0.016) when patients attended via face‐to‐face appointments. Of the 629 patients reviewed via telehealth in 2020 and who had been with our service for over 12 months, glycaemic control was better in 2020 (HbA1c 7.8 ± 1.4% (62 ± 15 mmol/mol)) compared to 12 months ago (8.2 ± 1.7% (66 ± 19 mmol/mol), p < 0.001). There was no difference in the number of unplanned admissions for this cohort in 2020 (n = 58, 9.2%) compared to 2019 (n = 75, 11.9%, p = 0.100). CONCLUSION: The study showed that for patients with diabetes who received care via telehealth consultations during COVID‐19 lockdown, their glycaemic control was slightly better and unplanned admission rates was not higher compared to the pre‐COVID‐19 period. Telehealth consultation offers an important care delivery option in the management of patients with diabetes under the circumstances. This article is protected by copyright.

In tropical and subtropical regions, ARBOD diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are frequent. In both COVID-19 and ARBOD cases, an accurate diagnosis of infected patients is crucial to promote adequate treatment and isolation measures in COVID-19 cases. Overlap of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters between COVID-19 and ARBOD present themselves as an extra challenge during diagnosis. COVID-19 diagnosis is mainly performed by quantitative reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), while ARBOD diagnosis is performed by serology, detection of antigen or antibody, and molecular diagnosis. In this review, the epidemiologic profile of arboviruses and SARS-CoV-2 is analyzed, and potential risks of symptom overlap is addressed. The implementation of an analytical platform based on infrared (IR) spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and RT-qPCR is discussed as an efficient strategy for a fast, robust, reliable, and cost-effective diagnosis system even during the co-occurrence of virus outbreaks. The spectral data of IR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF MS obtained from COVID-19 infected and recovered patients can be used to build up an integrated spectral database. This approach can enable us to determine quickly the groups that have been exposed and have recovered from COVID-19 or ARBOD, avoiding misdiagnoses.","Costa, Jéssica; Ferreira, Eugénio C.; Santos, Cledir",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9040708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808104/,150

Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted by E (y|x). In this paper polynomial regression analysis has been improved through efficient selection of variables that is coefficient of determination. Coefficient of determination is a square of the correlation between new predicted y values and actual y values and its values are in the range from 0 to 1. The main purpose of regression analysis is to discover the relationship among the independent and dependent variables or in other words it is an explanation of variation in one variable with another variable. In this paper, the main focus is on Multivariate data sets that have many attributes and it is not necessary that all variables are required for data analysis purposes. Using coefficient of determination (COD) irrelevant attributes get eliminated during analysis. The main objective of research is to reduce the cost of data maintenance, reduce the execution time and improve the prediction accuracy rate. COD helps in selecting suitable independent variables. It is a notch that is used in statistical analysis that assesses how well a model explains and forecasts upcoming outcomes. This method also helps in eliminating the irrelevant variables which are not required for the prediction model by this maintenance cost and size of data sets can be reduced.","Sagar, Pinki; Gupta, Prinima; Kashyap, Indu",Int J Inf Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33681697/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41870-021-00619-9,150

At the same time, neoliberal health discourse advises older people to avoid activities that may cause injuries, such as slips and falls, creating contradictions for older people who participate in sports on ice. In light of these mixed messages, this paper explores how older men understand their bodies through their participation in the seemingly risky sport of ice hockey. I conducted eighteen semi-structured interviews with older Canadian men who played hockey, identifying common themes related to aging, embodiment, risk and pleasure. Participants were aware that common-sense discourse produced hockey as risky for the old, but often downplayed this risk, privileging pleasure. Discourses associated with pleasure acted as an important way for older men to examine their bodies and contemplate the significance of hockey in their lives. Through the comradery players developed with each other, their interactions with the material objects of hockey, and their emplacement on hockey rinks and arenas, they found ways to celebrate their bodies as both aging and capable of experiencing pleasure — implicitly challenging neoliberal discourses of old age in the process.","Allain, Kristi A.",J Aging Stud,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaging.2020.100895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33272455/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890406520300657; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890406520300657,150

Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are critical for controlling virus infections. Here, we identified 897 type I ISGs induced by interferon-α (IFN-α) in chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) by RNA-Seq. In addition, we further identified 152 potential anti-ALV-J chicken type I ISGs. Among these potential anti-ALV-J ISGs, chicken cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (chCH25H) was selected for further antiviral mechanism studies in chicken embryo fibroblast cell lines (DF1). The gene chCH25H is located on chromosome 6 and clustered in a distinct group with mammals CH25H in the phylogenetic tree. The core promoter region of chCH25H was located within −75/−1 sequence. We found that chCH25H was induced by chicken IFN-α and ALV-J in DF1 cells. The overexpression of chCH25H significantly inhibited ALV-J replication in DF1 cells at 48 h post infection (hpi). In addition, ALV-J replication was significantly enhanced in the chCH25H- knockout DF1 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that chCH25H restricted ALV-J infection through the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), rather than type I and II interferon. Our results identified 152 potential anti-ALV-J chicken type I ISGs and revealed that 25HC, the product of chCH25H, could be used as a natural antiviral agent to control ALV-J infection.","Xie, Tingting; Feng, Min; Dai, Manman; Mo, Guodong; Ruan, Zhuohao; Wang, Guiyan; Shi, Meiqing; Zhang, Xiquan",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v11060498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31151272/,150

654688,Peptide Vaccine: Progress and Challenges,2014-07-02,"Emerging zoonoses with pandemic potential are a stated priority for the global health security agenda, but endemic zoonoses also have a major societal impact in low-resource settings. Although many endemic zoonoses can be treated, timely diagnosis and appropriate clinical management of human cases is often challenging. Preventive ‘One Health’ interventions, e.g. interventions in animal populations that generate human health benefits, may provide a useful approach to overcoming some of these challenges. Effective strategies, such as animal vaccination, already exist for the prevention, control and elimination of many endemic zoonoses, including rabies, and several livestock zoonoses (e.g. brucellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever) that are important causes of human febrile illness and livestock productivity losses in low- and middle-income countries. We make the case that, for these diseases, One Health interventions have the potential to be more effective and generate more equitable benefits for human health and livelihoods, particularly in rural areas, than approaches that rely exclusively on treatment of human cases. We hypothesize that applying One Health interventions to tackle these health challenges will help to build trust, community engagement and cross-sectoral collaboration, which will in turn strengthen the capacity of fragile health systems to respond to the threat of emerging zoonoses and other future health challenges. One Health interventions thus have the potential to align the ongoing needs of disadvantaged communities with the concerns of the broader global community, providing a pragmatic and equitable approach to meeting the global goals for sustainable development and supporting the global health security agenda.

655957,A decoy strategy to activate the immune system.,2021-08-29,"BACKGROUND: Youth experiencing homelessness are more likely than housed youth to experience premature death, suicide, drug overdose, pregnancy, substance use, and mental illness. Yet while youth experiencing homelessness are 6 to 12 times more likely to become infected with HIV than housed youth, with HIV prevalence as high as 16%, many do not access the prevention services they need. Despite adversities, youth experiencing homelessness are interested in health promotion programs, can be recruited and retained in interventions and research studies, and demonstrate improved outcomes when programs are tailored and relevant to them. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to compare the efficacy of a nurse case management HIV prevention and care intervention, titled Come As You Are, with that of usual care among youth experiencing homelessness aged 16 to 25 years. METHODS: The study is designed as a 2-armed randomized wait-list controlled trial. Participants (n=450) will be recruited and followed up for 9 months after the intervention for a total study period of 12 months. Come As You Are combines nurse case management with a smartphone-based daily ecological momentary assessment to develop participant-driven HIV prevention behavioral goals that can be monitored in real-time. Youth in the city of Houston, Texas will be recruited from drop-in centers, shelters, street outreach programs, youth-serving organizations, and clinics. RESULTS: Institutional review board approval (Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston) was obtained in November 2018. The first participant was enrolled in November 2019. Data collection is ongoing. To date, 123 participants have consented to participate in the study, 89 have been enrolled, and 15 have completed their final follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of HIV prevention research regarding youth experiencing homelessness. Novel and scalable interventions that address the full continuum of behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention are needed. This study will determine whether a personalized and mobile HIV prevention approach can reduce HIV risk among a hard-to-reach, transient population of youth at high risk.

AIMS: There is an urgent need to understand the risk and protective factors associated with poor mental well-being of UK HCWs working during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Shortly after the April 2020 UK COVID-19 peak 2773 HCWs completed a survey containing measures of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and stress, as well as questions around potential predictors such as roles, COVID-19 risk perception and workplace-related factors. Respondents were classified as high or low symptomatic on each scale and logistic regression revealed factors associated with severe psychiatric symptoms. Change in well-being from pre- to during COVID-19 was also quantified. RESULTS: Nearlya third of HCWs reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression, and the number reporting very high symptoms was more than quadruple that pre-COVID-19. Several controllable factors were associated with the most severe level of psychiatric symptoms: insufficient personal protective equipment availability, workplace preparation, training and communication, and higher workload. Being female, ‘front line’, previous psychiatric diagnoses, traumatic events, and being an allied HCW or manager were also significantly associated with severe psychiatric symptoms. Sharing stress, resilience and ethical support for treatment decisions were significantly associated with low psychiatric symptoms. Front-line workers showed greater worsening of mental health compared with non-front-line HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: Poor mental well-being was prevalent during the COVID-19 response, however, controllable factors associated with severe psychiatric symptoms are available to be targeted to reduce the detrimental impact of COVID-19 and other pandemics on HCW mental health.","Gilleen, James; Santaolalla, Aida; Valdearenas, Lorena; Salice, Clara; Fusté, Montserrat",BJPsych Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910674/; https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.42,150

A secondary objective is to evaluate the necessity of developing age- or gender-specific HRQoL instruments. Methods: We explored the meaning of general and health-related QoL through focus group discussions in Singapore, a multi-ethnic Asian society. Two investigators independently analysed the data. They extracted major and sub-themes related to both general and health-related QoL. The agreement between the analyses was compared and disagreement was resolved through discussion. Results: Thirty-two subjects (children: 50.0%, female: 50.0%) participated. There were few disagreements. Meanings of general and health-related QoL could be grouped under three broad themes: (1) physical, (2) psychological and (3) social health, consistent with the current definition of HRQoL. We found that Singaporean and Western children/adolescents share a remarkably similar notion of general and health-related QoL. Compared to adolescents, children were more likely to report positive emotions, be less mindful of others’ opinions and had less varied social activities. Conclusion: The results suggest that currently available instruments are potentially useful for Singaporean children/adolescents.

The development of methods to effectively decontaminate N95 respirators while maintaining their integrity is crucial for respirator regeneration and reuse. In this study, we systematically evaluated five respirator decontamination methods using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) or ultraviolet (254 nm wavelength, UVC) radiation. Through testing the bioburden, filtration, fluid resistance, and fit (shape) of the decontaminated respirators, we found that the decontamination methods using BioQuell VHP, custom VHP container, Steris VHP, and Sterrad VHP effectively inactivated Cardiovirus (3-log(10) reduction) and bacteria (6-log(10) reduction) without compromising the respirator integrity after 2–15 cycles.

656771,Synthesis and Decontamination Effect on Chemical and Biological Agents of Benzoxonium-Like Salts,2021-09-15,"Bovine norovirus (BNoV) is a diarrhea-causing pathogen of calves. In this study, 211 diarrheic fecal samples were collected from 25 farms across six provinces in China, between November 2017 and September 2018. 20.4% of the samples were detected as BNoV-positive by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analyses based on RdRp, VP1, and VP2 fragments revealed these BNoV strains had unique evolutionary characteristics. The complete genome of strain Bo/BET–17/18/CH was successfully sequenced. It was 7321 nucleotides (nt) in length, shared 79.4–80.9% nt identity with all five BNoV genomes, clustered on a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that strain Bo/BET–17/18/CH could represent a novel BNoV strain. Two interesting characteristics were found in the genome: (i) the VP1 sequence differed greatly from known BNoV VP1 sequences; (ii) a recombination event is predicted within the ORF1–ORF2 overlap. Moreover 16.3% (7/43) of the BNoV were identified as the novel VP1 genotype, which were distributed on four farms across two provinces, indicating that the novel VP1 genotype strain has spread. To our knowledge, this is first description of the molecular and genomic characteristics of BNoV in China. These findings extend our understanding of the genetic evolution and epidemics of BNoV.","Wang, Yuelin; Yue, Hua; Tang, Cheng",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-48569-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427703/,150

METHODS: The survey was conducted in the European Hip Society (EHS) and the European Knee Associates (EKA). The survey consisted of 20 questions (single, multiple choice, ranked). Four topics were addressed: (1) origin and surgical experience of the participant (four questions); (2) potential disruption of arthroplasty surgeries (12 questions); (3) influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the particular arthroplasty surgeon (four questions); (4) a matrix provided 14 different arthroplasty surgeries and the participant was asked to state whether dedicated surgery was stopped, delayed or cancelled. RESULTS: Two-hundred and seventy-two surgeons (217 EHS, 55 EKA) from 40 different countries participated. Of the respondents, 25.7% stated that all surgeries were cancelled in their departments, while 68.4% responded that elective inpatient procedures were no longer being performed. With regard to the specific surgical procedures, nearly all primary TJA were cancelled (92.6%) as well as aseptic revisions (94.7%). In most hospitals, periprosthetic fractures (87.2%), hip arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures and septic revisions for acute infections (75.8%) were still being performed. CONCLUSION: During the current 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, we are experiencing a near-total shutdown of TJA. A massive cutback was observed for primary TJA and revision TJA, even in massively failed TJA with collapse, dislocation, component failure or imminent dislocation. Only life-threatening pathologies like periprosthetic fractures and acute septic TJA are currently undergoing surgical treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V.

METHODS: A questionnaire regarding COVID-19 symptoms and exposure history was administered to all individuals contacting the Israeli Defense Forces “Corona call-center”, prior to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Surveyed symptoms included cough, fever, sore throat, rhinorrhea, loss of taste or smell, chest pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Factors were compared between positive and negative cases based on confirmatory test results, and positive likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated. Results were stratified by sex, BMI, previous medical history and dates of questioning and a multivariable analysis for association with positive test was conducted. RESULTS: Of 24,362 respondents, 59.1% were men with a median age of 20.5 years (IQR 19.6-22.4). Significant positive LRs were associated with loss of taste or smell (LR 3.38, 95%CI 3.01-3.79), suspected exposure (LR 1.33, 95%CI 1.28-1.39) and fever (LR 1.26, 95%CI 1.17-1.36). Those factors were also associated with positive PCR result in a multivariable analysis (OR 3.51 (3.04-4.06), OR 1.86 (1.65-2.09) and OR 1.34 (1.19-1.51), respectively).

However, extensive studies have found that only a small number of transplanted cells migrate to the site of injury or lesion, and repair efficacy is very limited. METHODS: Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) were generated that overexpressed the erythropoietin (EPO) gene using a lentivirus. Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to detect the viability of BM-MSCs after overexpressing EPO. Cell migration and apoptosis were verified using Boyden chamber and flow cytometry, respectively. Finally, the anti-fibrosis efficacy of EPO-MSCs was evaluated in vivo using immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: EPO overexpression promoted cell viability and migration of BM-MSCs without inducing apoptosis, and EPO-MSC treatment significantly alleviated liver fibrosis in a carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) induced mouse liver fibrosis model. CONCLUSION: EPO-MSCs enhance anti-fibrotic efficacy, with higher cell viability and stronger migration ability compared with treatment with BM-MSCs only. These findings support improving the efficiency of MSCs transplantation as a potential therapeutic strategy for liver fibrosis.","Wang, Xianyao; Wang, Huizhen; Lu, Junhou; Feng, Zhanhui; Liu, Zhongshan; Song, Hailiang; Wang, Heng; Zhou, Yanhua; Xu, Jianwei",Tissue Eng Regen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32621283/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13770-020-00276-2,150

This study assessed the effects of a randomized trial on oral health related quality of life comparing an individual-based oral hygiene intervention to a community-based intervention. METHODS: Participants were recruited from six low-income senior housing residences. Buildings were randomly assigned to receive the individual-based intervention followed by the community-based intervention or to receive the community-based intervention followed by the individual intervention. Participants' oral hygiene was assessed at baseline (T0), one month after the first intervention (T1) and one month after the second intervention (T2) and six months after the T2 assessment (T3). Oral hygiene was measured by the Gingival Index (GI) and Plaque scores (PS). Surveys collected data on beliefs, attitudes, behaviors and self-reported health status at T0, T1 and T2. Only oral hygiene and quality of life, measured by the General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI), was assessed at all time points. general linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to assess changes in GOHAI over time, the interaction of condition by time and the contribution of psychosocial, behavioral, health status and background variables to changes in GOHAI. RESULTS: 331 people completed T0 assessments; 306 completed T1; 285 completed T2 and 268 completed T3. Scores on GOHAI at T0 ranged from 10 to 48 with a mean of 39.7 (sd = 7.8) and a median of 42. At T1, mean GOHAI was 40.7 (sd = 8.2), at T2 mean GOHAI was 41.1 (sd = 7.8) and at T3, GOHAI was 42.3 (sd = 8.2). GLMM showed that GOHAI improved significantly from T0 to T3 (p = 0.01) but the time by intervention interaction was not significant indicating that both interventions were effective in improving GOHAI but one intervention was not better than the other. Ethnicity, health status, worries, self-efficacy, number of missing teeth and symptoms of dry mouth were related to improvements in GOHAI. Neither GI nor PS were related to GOHAI. CONCLUSIONS: The participants reported relatively good oral health related quality of life which improved significantly over time. Improvement occurred among all participants regardless of condition, suggesting that either intervention would be effective in future studies.

Yet much less is known about the implications for suppliers operating in regional value chains (RVCs) in the global South. In this article, we focus on Eswatini, which has grown to become the largest African manufacturer and exporter of apparel to the region. We draw on a combination of firm-level export data and interviews with stakeholders before and after the Covid-19 lockdown to shed light on the influence of private and public governance on suppliers’ economic and social upgrading and downgrading. We point to the coexistence of two separate private governance structures: the first characterised by direct contracts between South African retailers and large manufacturers (direct suppliers); the second operating through indirect purchasing via intermediaries from relatively smaller producers (indirect suppliers). While direct suppliers enjoyed higher levels of economic and social upgrading than indirect suppliers before Covid-19, the pandemic reinforced this division, with severe price cuts for indirect suppliers. Furthermore, while retailers provided some direct suppliers with support throughout the crisis, this was not the case for indirect suppliers, who remain comparatively more vulnerable. In terms of public governance, the negative consequences of the lockdown on firms’ income and workers’ livelihoods have been compounded by the state’s ineffective response. Our paper contributes to the research on RVCs in the global South, enhancing our understanding of how different governance structures and external shocks affect firms’ and workers’ upgrading and downgrading prospects.","Pasquali, Giovanni; Godfrey, Shane",Eur J Dev Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33716410/; https://doi.org/10.1057/s41287-021-00383-3,150

OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency of arterial and venous thromboembolic disease, risk factors, prevention and management patterns, and outcomes in patients with COVID-19, the authors designed a multicenter, observational cohort study. METHODS: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 1,114 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed through our Mass General Brigham integrated health network. The total cohort was analyzed by site of care: intensive care (n = 170); hospitalized nonintensive care (n = 229); and outpatient (n = 715). The primary study outcome was a composite of adjudicated major arterial or venous thromboembolism. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 were 22.3% Hispanic/Latinx and 44.2% non-White. Cardiovascular risk factors of hypertension (35.8%), hyperlipidemia (28.6%), and diabetes (18.0%) were common. Prophylactic anticoagulation was prescribed in 89.4% of patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care cohort and 84.7% of those in the hospitalized nonintensive care setting. Frequencies of major arterial or venous thromboembolism, major cardiovascular adverse events, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism were highest in the intensive care cohort (35.3%, 45.9%, and 27.0 %, respectively) followed by the hospitalized nonintensive care cohort (2.6%, 6.1%, and 2.2%, respectively) and the outpatient cohort (0% for all).

Our results showed that SADS-CoV N protein could inhibit type I interferon (IFN) production mediated by Sendai virus (Sev) and could block the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Simultaneously, the IFN-β promoter activity mediated by TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) or its upstream molecules in the RLRs signal pathway was inhibited by SADS-CoV N protein. Further investigations revealed that SADS-CoV N protein could counteract interaction between TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and TBK1, which led to reduced TBK1 activation and IFN-β production. Our study is the first report of the interaction between SADS-CoV N protein and the host antiviral innate immune responses, and the mechanism utilized by SADS-CoV N protein provides a new insight of coronaviruses evading host antiviral innate immunity.","Zhou, Zhihai; Sun, Yuan; Xu, Jingya; Tang, Xiaoyu; Zhou, Ling; Li, Qianniu; Lan, Tian; Ma, Jingyun",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692778/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.573078,150

The data included the COVID-19 High Frequency Phone Survey of Households in Ethiopia that were collected in 2021. This paper relied on the 10th round of the survey, which was comprised of 2178 households. The Instrumental Variable Probit regression model was used to analyze the data. The results showed that majority of the respondents (92.33%) would receiveCOVID-19 vaccines, while 6.61% and 1.06% were, respectively, unwilling and unsure. Across the regions of Ethiopia, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region (SNNPR) (99.30%), Oromia (97.54%), Tigray (97.04%) and Gambela (95.42%) had the highest proportions of respondents willing to have the vaccine. Vaccine safety concern was the topmost reason for those unwilling to receive the vaccine. The results of the Instrumental Variable Probit regression showed that currently working, age, engagement with non-farm businesses and region of residence significantly influenced the population’s willingness to take the vaccine (p < 0.05). It was concluded that although the willingness be vaccinated was impressive, without everyone being receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, infection risk can still be high; this is due to the persistent mutation of the viral strains. Thus, there is a need to intensify efforts toward addressing the safety issues of COVID-19 vaccines, while efforts to enhance acceptability should focus on the youth population and those who are unemployed.","Oyekale, Abayomi Samuel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501483/,150

Numerous studies have shown that neutralizing antibodies against the virus can be found in patients infected with SARS-CoV within days upon the onset of illness and lasting up to several months. In contrast, there is little data on the kinetics of T cell responses during SARS-CoV infection and little is known about their role in the recovery process. However, recent studies in mice suggest the importance of T cells in viral clearance during SARS-CoV infection. Moreover, a growing number of studies have investigated the memory T cell responses in recovered SARS patients. This review covers the available literature on the emerging importance of T cell responses in SARS-CoV infection, particularly on the mapping of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, longevity, polyfunctionality and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) association as well as their potential implications on treatment and vaccine development.","Janice Oh, Hsueh-Ling; Ken-En Gan, Samuel; Bertoletti, Antonio; Tan, Yee-Joo",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2012.26; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038429/,150

663193,Infectious Disease Risk Across the Growing Human-Non Human Primate Interface: A Review of the Evidence,2019-11-05,"Many countries have passed their first COVID-19 epidemic peak. Traditional epidemiological models describe this as a result of non-pharmaceutical interventions that pushed the growth rate below the recovery rate. In this new phase of the pandemic many countries show an almost linear growth of confirmed cases for extended time-periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain by traditional models where infection numbers either grow explosively until herd immunity is reached, or the epidemic is completely suppressed (zero new cases). Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the structure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate there exists a critical number of social contacts, Dc, below which linear growth and low infection prevalence must occur. Above Dc traditional epidemiological dynamics takes place, as e.g. in SIR-type models. When calibrating our corresponding model to empirical estimates of the transmission rate and the number of days being contagious, we find Dc ~ 7.2. Assuming realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown measures would reduce that to household-size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual infection curves with a remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of parameters. In particular we compare the US and Austria, as examples for one country that initially did not impose measures and one that responded with a severe lockdown early on. Our findings question the applicability of standard compartmental models to describe the COVID-19 containment phase. The probability to observe linear growth in these is practically zero.","Thurner, S.; Klimek, P.; Hanel, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.22.20110403v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.22.20110403,150

However, well-documented disparities persist in the use of digital technologies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe smartphone and internet use within a diverse sample, to assess the association of smartphone and internet use with markers of health literacy and health access, and to identify the mediating factors in these relationships. METHODS: Surveys were distributed to a targeted sample designed to oversample historically underserved communities from April 2017 to December 2017. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the association of internet and smartphone use with outcomes describing health care access and markers of health literacy for the total cohort and after stratifying by personal history of cancer. Health care access was captured using multiple variables, including the ability to obtain medical care when needed. Markers of health literacy included self-reported confidence in obtaining health information. RESULTS: Of the 2149 participants, 1319 (61.38%) were women, 655 (30.48%) were non-Hispanic White, and 666 (30.99%) were non-Hispanic Black. The median age was 51 years (IQR 38-65).

Internet use was associated with having looked for information on health topics from any source (odds ratio [OR] 3.81, 95% CI 2.53-5.75) and confidence in obtaining health information when needed (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.00-3.34) compared with noninternet users. Smartphone owners had lower odds of being unable to obtain needed medical care (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40-0.95) than nonsmartphone owners. Among participants with a prior history of cancer, smartphone ownership was significantly associated with higher odds of confidence in ability to obtain needed health information (OR 5.63, 95% CI 1.05-30.23) and lower odds of inability to obtain needed medical care (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.06-0.47), although these associations were not significant among participants without a prior history of cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We describe widespread use of digital technologies in a community-based cohort, although disparities persist. In this cohort, smartphone ownership was significantly associated with ability to obtain needed medical care, suggesting that the use of smartphone technology may play a role in increasing health care access. Similarly, major illnesses such as cancer have the potential to amplify health engagement. Finally, special emphasis must be placed on reaching patient populations with limited digital access, so these patients are not further disadvantaged in the new age of telehealth.","Oshima, Sachiko M; Tait, Sarah D; Thomas, Samantha M; Fayanju, Oluwadamilola M; Ingraham, Kearston; Barrett, Nadine J; Hwang, E Shelley",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/24947; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106076/,150
663476,Optimizing Anti-Viral Vaccine Responses: Input from a Non-Specialist,2020-05-15,"This study aimed to analyze the geographical distribution of COVID-19 and to identify high-risk areas for the occurrence of cases and deaths from the disease in the indigenous population of Brazil. This is an ecological study whose units of analysis were the Special Indigenous Sanitary Districts. Cases and deaths by COVID-19 notified by the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health between March and October 2020 were included. To verify the spatial association, the Getis-Ord General G and Getis-Ord Gi * techniques were used. High spatial risk clusters have been identified by the scan statistics technique. 32,041 cases of COVID-19 and 471 deaths were reported. The incidence and mortality rates were between 758.14 and 18530.56 cases and 5.96 and 265.37 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants, respectively. The non-randomness of cases (z-score = 5.40; p <0.001) and deaths (z-score = 3.83; p <0.001) was confirmed. Hotspots were evidenced for both events with confidence levels of 90, 95 and 99% concentrated in the North and Midwest regions of the country. Eight high-risk spatial clusters for cases with a relative risk (RR) between 1.08 and 4.11 (p <0.05) and two risk clusters for deaths with RR between 3.08 and 3.97 (p <0.05) were identified. The results indicate critical areas in the indigenous territories of Brazil and contribute to better targeting the control actions of COVID-19 in this population.","Alves, J. D.; Abade, A.

663738,Editorial: Complement and Immunotherapeutics,2021-02-24,"PURPOSE: In December 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as being responsible for the pulmonary infection called COVID-19. On 21 February 2020, the first autochthonous case of COVID-19 was detected in Italy. Our goal is to report the most common chest computed tomography (CT) findings identified in 64 patients, in the initial phase of COVID-19. METHODS: Sixty-four chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) examinations performed at the Radiology Unit of the Hospital of Cremona, from 22 to 29 February 2020, of 64 patients during first week of hospitalization for COVID-19 were retrospectively evaluated. All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Image analysis was independently conducted by 2 radiologists with 10 years and 1 year of experience in chest imaging. The inter-observer agreement was obtained by applying a Cohen’s κ test. RESULTS: The average age of patients was 67.1 years (± 12.2); men 42 (66%). HRCT was performed on the 5(th) (± 1.5) day of hospitalization. More frequently, the initial CT changes of the lung show more or less extensive areas of ground-glass, as single pattern or with parenchymal consolidations. Coronavirus lung involvement appears very frequently multi-lobar, bilateral, and it concerns both subpleural and central regions. An excellent agreement (κ: 0.88-1, CI: 0.79-1.01, p < 0.05) concerning CT findings between the 2 operators was reached. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that detection of the most frequent pulmonary CT-scan changes, in the early stages of COVID-19, can be performed, with excellent agreement, among readers with different experience, and consequently attribute their exact diagnostic value, in an appropriate clinical and environmental exposure setting.","Sabatino, Vittorio; Sergio, Pietro; Muri, Margherita; Zangrandi, Ilaria; Voltini, Giuseppe; Bosio, Giancarlo; Betti, Monia; Baglivo, Francesca; Martinelli, Enrico; Pan, Angelo; Pierfranceschi, Matteo Giorgi; Corvino, Antonio; Romanini, Laura",Pol J Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33828629/; https://doi.org/10.5114/pjr.2021.104856,150

The separation and purification of glycyrrhizin from a methanol–water (70:30 (v/v)) extract of liquorice roots was achieved using high-speed counter-current chromatography. The separation was performed at a preparative scale in a one-step separation with a two-phase solvent system composed of ethyl acetate–methanol–water (5:2:5 (v/v)). The lower phase was used as the mobile phase in the head-to-tail elution mode. The present method yielded 42.2 mg glycyrrhizin at 96.8% purity from 130 mg of the crude exact with 95.2% recovery as determined by HPLC analysis.,"Jiang, Yue; Lu, Hai-Tao; Chen, Feng",J Chromatogr A,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967304000998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15072305/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021967304000998,150
664665,A Mentee’s Baby Registry: Supporting New Academic Parents in 2020,2020-09-30,"Abstract Background: Cognitive impairment is common following critical illness. A number of case reports and case series have suggested that cognitive deficits occur in patients with COVID-19. This study evaluated the frequency, severity, and profile of cognitive dysfunction in hospitalized patients recovering from COVID-19. Methods: We obtained and analyzed cross-sectional neuropsychological data from a cohort of N=57 patients participating in inpatient rehabilitation. Our primary outcome measure was the Brief Memory and Executive Test (BMET). We calculated the frequency of impairment based on clinician diagnosis and by the BMET subtests using age-normed classification of impairment. We explored associations with intubation and extubation as markers of illness severity and complications, as well as psychiatric diagnosis. Results: Our sample was 75% male, 61% non-white, with a mean age of 64.5 (SD = 13.9) years. Patients were evaluated at a mean of 43.2 days post-admission. 88% had documented hypoxemic respiratory failure and 77% required intubation. 81% of patients had cognitive impairment, ranging from mild to severe. Deficits were most common in working memory (55% of patients impaired), set-shifting (47%), divided attention (46%), and processing speed (40%). Executive dysfunction was not significantly associated with intubation length or the time from extubation to assessment, nor was it associated with the presence of a psychiatric diagnosis. Discussion and Conclusion: Medically stable inpatients recovering from COVID-19 commonly have deficits in attention and executive functions. These deficits were not significantly correlated with length of intubation or time since extubation. Findings provide an early benchmark for studying the evolution of cognitive difficulties after COVID-19 and suggest that easy to disseminate interventions that remediate attention and executive dysfunctions may be important in this population.","Jaywant, A.; Vanderlind, W.

665048,Load reduction in live PRRS vaccines using oil and polymer adjuvants,2012-12-31,"Between 2003 and 2009, the prevalence of extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (XDR-PA) increased significantly in northern Taiwan from 1.0% to 2.1%. Molecular methods were used to investigate the genetic relatedness and carbapenem resistance mechanisms of a collection of 203 non-repetitive XDR-PA isolates available for study. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), 52 genotypes were observed; one predominant genotype (pulsotype 1) was found in 57.6% of the isolates. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequencing and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR analyses demonstrated that one horizontally acquired mechanism [metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) genes] and two mutational mechanisms (efflux and porins) accounted for the carbapenem resistance. The most predominant horizontally acquired mechanism was carriage of bla(VIM-3), which was found in 61.1% of isolates. Decreased expression of oprD was the most prevalent mutational mechanism and was found in 70.0% of the XDR-PA isolates, whereas overexpression of mexA was found in 27.6% of the isolates. The highlight of this study was the discovery of statistically significant relationships between certain horizontally acquired and mutational resistance mechanisms and their contribution to carbapenem susceptibility. MBL-producers expressed significantly lower MexAB and higher OprD than non-MBL-producers. Amongst isolates without an acquired β-lactamase gene, oprD expression was significantly reduced, whilst expression of efflux pumps was increased. Reduced OprD expression alone or the production of VIM-type MBLs showed similar contributions to a low to intermediate MIC(50) (minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the organisms) for carbapenems. Isolates with reduced OprD expression that simultaneously harboured bla(VIM) exhibited high levels of resistance to carbapenems, which implied that these two mechanisms had a synergistic effect on the MICs.","Shu, Jwu-Ching; Chia, Ju-Hsin; Siu, Leung-Kei; Kuo, An-Jing; Huang, Shu-Huan; Su, Lin-Hui; Wu, Tsu-Lan",Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2011.09.023; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857911004079; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857911004079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22079532/,150
665068,Progress Toward In Vivo Use of siRNAs-II,2012-03-01,"Acute viral hepatitis refers to hepatic infection by the hepatotropic viruses hepatitis A–E. The acute infections look similar with regard to histologic features, with spotty necrosis throughout the lobules, hepatocyte unrest, swelling and apoptosis, and portal tract and intrasinusoidal inflammation, chiefly lymphocytes. The differential diagnosis histologically includes drug-induced liver injury. Structural differences and epidemiology define the major differences in the course of each of these viral infections. Hepatitis A and E are similar in causing only acute hepatitis, while some cases of hepatitis B and many of hepatitis C become chronic. The prevalence of hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection has seen a reduction worldwide due to hepatitis B vaccination programs. Nonetheless, major cities with continued intravenous drug use remain reservoirs with a rate of approximately 8% in Europe. The availability of direct-acting viral agents is spearheading efforts by WHO to eliminate new and chronic HCV infections by 2019. Histologic cholestasis may be a particular feature of acute hepatitis E. It should be noted that hepatitis E virus has four major genotypes of which 1 and 2 infect humans (resulting in travel/endemic-related hepatitis with cholestasis and high mortality in pregnant women) and 3 and 4 are zoonotic and infect pigs, boar and several other animal and avian species (and may cause hepatitis associated with poorly or uncooked meat).","Lefkowitch, Jay H.",Scheuer's Liver Biopsy Interpretation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702075841000061; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780702075841000061,150

Mutations in the RBD are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that have emerged independently worldwide. For example, the B.1.1.7 lineage has a mutation (N501Y) in its Spike RBD that enhances binding to ACE2. There are also ACE2 alleles in humans with mutations in the RBD binding site. Here we perform a detailed affinity and kinetics analysis of the effect of five common RBD mutations (K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K, and S477N) and two common ACE2 mutations (S19P and K26R) on the RBD/ACE2 interaction. We analysed the effects of individual RBD mutations and combinations found in new SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P1) variants. Most of these mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction. The exceptions were mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity. Taken together with other studies, our results suggest that the N501Y and S477N mutations enhance transmission primarily by enhancing binding, the K417N/T mutations facilitate immune escape, and the E484K mutation enhances binding and immune escape.","Barton, Michael I; MacGowan, Stuart A; Kutuzov, Mikhail A; Dushek, Omer; Barton, Geoffrey John; van der Merwe, P Anton",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.70658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34435953/,150

In spite of exhaustive studies and widely different diagnosis among returned patients, some cases of febrile illnesses remain without an etiological diagnosis, suggesting that these cases could be due to viral respiratory tract infections. From August 2005 to October 2006, 118 febrile patients without a specific diagnosis in their first visit at the Center for International Health of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona were included. In all of them, in order to study respiratory viruses, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected. Clinical and radiological features and epidemiological data, as well as other samples for microbiologic studies, were also collected during consultation. Based on the physician's judgment at the time of consultation, patients were classified into four groups: respiratory symptoms (62%), febrile syndrome with nonspecific symptoms (24%), digestive symptoms (10%), and patients presenting both respiratory and digestive symptoms (4%). A pathogen microorganism was detected in 61 patients (52%). Respiratory viruses were detected in 44 out of 118 (37%) travelers included in the study, representing 56% of the patients with respiratory symptoms. The most frequently viruses detected were influenza virus (38%), rhinovirus (23%), adenovirus (9%), and respiratory syncytial virus (9%). Respiratory viruses have been shown to play an important role in imported fever. In light of the fact that international tourism is an increasing phenomenon, new strategies to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses should be considered, specially for influenza when a vaccine is available.

This overwhelming situation can make them prone for psychological stress leading to anxiety and insomnia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We did an online self-administered questionnaire-based observational cross-sectional study amongst anaesthesiologists across India. The objectives were to find out the main causes for anxiety and insomnia in COVID-19 pandemic. Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were used for assessing anxiety and insomnia. RESULTS: Of 512 participants, 74.2% suffered from anxiety and 60.5% suffered from insomnia. The age <35 years, female sex, being married, resident doctors, fear of infection to self or family, fear of salary deductions, increase in working hours, loneliness due to isolation, food and accommodation issues and posting in COVID-19 duty were risk factors for anxiety. ISI scores ≥8 was observed in <35 years, unmarried, those with stress because of COVID-19, fear of loneliness, issues of food and accommodation, increased working hours and with GAD-7 score ≥5. Adjusted odd's ratio of insomnia in participants having GAD-7 score ≥5 was 10.499 (95% confidence interval 6.097–18.080; P < 0.001).

In Spain, the state of alarm was established from March 15 to June 20, 2020. Usually this fact decreased people's mobility and physical activity, in addition to producing or exacerbating psychological disorders. Our aim was to determine the influence that this condition had over the short-term ponderal results of patients undergoing laparoscopic vertical gastrectomy from May 2019 to May 2020. METHODS: Case-control study for comparing the percentage of excess weight lost (%EWL) and the percentage of total weight lost (%TWL) of patients that underwent a VG during the last year, so they were affected by lockdown in April and part of March 2020 (group 1), to the %EWL and %TWL of a control group (group 2), obtained from our previous series. RESULTS: The mean %EWL in group 1 is 47,37 ± 18,59 and in group 2 is 51,13 ± 17,59, being p = 0,438. Meanwhile, the mean %TWL in group 1 is 21,14 ± 8,17 and in group 2 is 24,67 ± 8,01, with p = 0,115.

We present the preliminary results of a survey aiming to explore the staff views on the changes in the care provided by the Gaetano Torre Rehabilitation Centre, and, the impact of these changes on professionals, patients and their families. The survey was carried out using an open-ended questionnaire including six-items, on the practical and psychological aspects emerged during the pandemic in relation to the healthcare services provided by the Centre and to the patients/caregivers conditions. The participants, most of them physiotherapists, highlighted 169 aspects emerging in the pandemic, 48.5% referring to the resources used to cope with critical issues and 51.5% concerning the difficulties encountered. Emotional aspects prevailed on practical aspects both in resources (52.4 vs 47.6%) and in difficulties (57.5 vs 42.5%) categories. In particular, with regard to patients’ resources, psychological benefits, despite the burden, were greater than practical ones (87 vs 13%), in the form of improved intra-family relationships, feeling more cared for, and satisfaction for the received care. As for the patients’ relatives, the staff indicated more resources than difficulties (72.8 vs 17.2%).

Health care providers in the United States often lack confidence to provide appropriate FGM/C-related care, and experience attitudes that may negatively impact quality of care for FGM/C. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of health care providers to explore the associations between health care provider characteristics, awareness of health complications of FGM/C, attitudes, and confidence for FGM/C care. Results: Factors associated with more Confidence for Clinical FGM/C Care include awareness of health complications, ever cared for a woman with FGM/C, being a woman or person of color, and more than 5 years of clinical practice. Increased Confidence in Communication Skills for FGM/C Care was associated with awareness of more health complications for FGM/C. Women endorsed significantly less Negative Attitudes toward FGM/C compared with men; no other factors were associated with health care provider attitudes. Conclusion: Future research should further investigate factors associated with health care provider attitudes toward FGM/C and those affected by the practice to promote quality care. Health providers require adequate training for clinical FGM/C care and in the communication skills that promote patient/provider communication cross-culturally.

Recently, the standard of care for HCC has been transformed as a combination of the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) atezolizumab plus the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab was shown to offer improved overall survival in the first-line setting. Immunotherapy has demonstrated safety and efficacy in later lines of therapy as well, and ongoing trials are investigating novel combinations of ICIs and TKIs, in addition to interventions earlier in the course of disease or in combination with liver-directed therapies. Because HCC usually develops against a background of cirrhosis, immunotherapy for liver tumors is complex and oncologists need to account for both immunological and hepatological considerations when developing a treatment plan for their patients. To provide guidance to the oncology community on important concerns for the immunotherapeutic care of HCC, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a clinical practice guideline (CPG). The expert panel drew on the published literature as well as their clinical experience to develop recommendations for healthcare professionals on these important aspects of immunotherapeutic treatment for HCC, including diagnosis and staging, treatment planning, immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and patient quality of life (QOL) considerations. The evidence- and consensus-based recommendations in this CPG are intended to give guidance to cancer care providers treating patients with HCC.","Greten, Tim F; Abou-Alfa, Ghassan K; Cheng, Ann-Lii; Duffy, Austin G; El-Khoueiry, Anthony B.; Finn, Richard S; Galle, Peter R; Goyal, Lipika; He, Aiwu Ruth; Kaseb, Ahmed O; Kelley, Robin Kate; Lencioni, Riccardo; Lujambio, Amaia; Mabry Hrones, Donna; Pinato, David J; Sangro, Bruno; Troisi, Roberto I; Wilson Woods, Andrea; Yau, Thomas; Zhu, Andrew X; Melero, Ignacio",J Immunother Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518290/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2021-002794,150

Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, became the epicenter of the disease in China. The rapid growth of patients had exceeded the maximum affordability of local medical resources. A large comprehensive gymnasium was converted into Wuchang Fangcang Shelter Hospital in order to provide adequate medical beds and appropriate care for the confirmed patients with mild to moderate symptoms. For these hospitalized patients with COVID-19, medication became the mainstay of therapy. From 5th February to 10th March, a team of pharmacists successfully completed drug supplies and pharmaceutical services for 1124 patients and approximately 800 medical staff, and, while doing so, received zero complaint, and experienced zero disputes and zero pharmacist infection. This paper summarizes the development and construction of the pharmacy, human resource allocation of pharmacists, pharmacy administration, and pharmaceutical services. It aims to review a 34-day period of pharmaceutical practice and serve as a reference for other health professionals working on COVID-19 prevention and treatment in other regions.

Though vaccines are available, the virus is mutating to form new strains among which are the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 that demonstrate increased transmissivity and infectivity. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to explore the role of the mutations in the interaction of the virus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with the host receptor ACE2. We find that the hydrogen bond networks are rearranged in the variants and also that new hydrogen bonds are established between the RBD and ACE2 as a result of mutations. We investigated three variants: the wild-type (WT), B.1.1.7, and B.1.351. We find that the B.1.351 variant (also known as 501Y.V2) shows larger flexibility in the RBD loop segment involving residue K484, yet the RBD–ACE2 complex shows higher stability. Mutations that allow a more flexible interface that can result in a more stable complex may be a factor contributing to the increased infectivity of the mutated variants.","Bhattarai, Nisha; Baral, Prabin; Gerstman, Bernard S.; Chapagain, Prem P.",J Phys Chem B,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34110159/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c01626,150
673013,"EAN congress highlights challenges — predict, prevent, repair",2020-06-26,"It is normal for hosts to be co-infected by parasites. Interactions among co-infecting species can have profound consequences, including changing parasite transmission dynamics, altering disease severity and confounding attempts at parasite control. Despite the importance of co-infection, there is currently no way to predict how different parasite species may interact with one another, nor the consequences of those interactions. Here, we demonstrate a method that enables such prediction by identifying two nematode parasite groups based on taxonomy and characteristics of the parasitological niche. From an understanding of the interactions between the two defined groups in one host system (wild rabbits), we predict how two different nematode species, from the same defined groups, will interact in co-infections in a different host system (sheep), and then we test this experimentally. We show that, as predicted, in co-infections, the blood-feeding nematode Haemonchus contortus suppresses aspects of the sheep immune response, thereby facilitating the establishment and/or survival of the nematode Trichostrongylus colubriformis; and that the T. colubriformis-induced immune response negatively affects H. contortus. This work is, to our knowledge, the first to use empirical data from one host system to successfully predict the specific outcome of a different co-infection in a second host species. The study therefore takes the first step in defining a practical framework for predicting interspecific parasite interactions in other animal systems.","Lello, Joanne; McClure, Susan J.; Tyrrell, Kerri; Viney, Mark E.",Proc Biol Sci,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.2610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29540516/,150

Employing logistic regression analyzes, we explored the association between demographic factors, history of screening positive for depression, and PRAPARE scores and patients’ odds of getting tested and testing positive for COVID-19. While variables such as ethnicity mirrored similar findings from other sources, we found the PRAPARE score to be associated with increased odds of being tested for COVID-19; however, it was not significantly associated with testing positive.

674226,Challenges within our current education model and where to direct innovation: the three-strand triquetra approach,2020-11-27,"BACKGROUND: Many patients with mental disorders are treated by their general practitioner (GP). Innovative technology-based integrated care models (e.g., mental health specialist video consultations) have been proposed to facilitate access to specialist services in primary care settings. While perspectives of patients and providers have been examined, there is little insight into the perspectives of health policy experts on such models. The purpose of this study was to examine the perspectives of health policy experts on (1) current challenges for continuity of care, (2) anticipated benefits and barriers for implementation of mental health specialist video consultations along with (3) practical and regulative preconditions for sustained implementation in primary care. METHODS: In a cross-sectional qualitative study, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with health policy experts representing various stakeholders in the German health care system: health insurances, governmental bodies, clinicians’ professional associations, and patient representatives. Following a critical realism approach, we applied a qualitative inductive content analysis to derive key themes from the material. RESULTS: Health policy experts saw long waiting times for patients and a lack of collaboration between in- and outpatient mental health services as well as mental health specialists and GPs as main barriers for current continuity of care. Health policy experts also felt that video consultations bear great potential to foster coordinated care between GPs and specialists and ensure timely referral for severely burdened patients. Increased workload for the general practice staff to facilitate video consultations and difficulties in establishing reliable therapeutic alliances between patients and specialists via remote treatment were considered as major barriers. Health policy experts varied significantly in their level of knowledge concerning legal frameworks and regulations pertaining to video consultations. However, the implementation of appropriate reimbursement schemes and sufficient data protection were regarded as the major regulative challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Health policy experts mostly consider mental health specialist video consultations as a promising way to overcome current challenges for the management of patients with mental disorders at the interface between primary and specialist care. To ensure sustained implementation, a multi-stakeholder approach accounting for the perspective of health policy experts, patients, and providers should be followed.

In particular, in elderly and frail individuals the infection can lead to severe disease and even fatal outcomes. Although the pandemic is primarily a human health crisis its consequences are much broader with a tremendous impact on global economics and social systems. Vaccines are considered the most powerful measure to fight the pandemic and protect people from COVID‐19. Based on the concerted activities of scientists, manufacturers and regulators, the urgent need for effective countermeasures has provoked the development and licensure of novel COVID‐19 vaccines in an unprecedentedly fast and flexible manner within <1 year. To ensure the safety and efficacy of these novel vaccines during the clinical development and the routine use in post‐licensure vaccination campaigns existing regulatory requirements and procedures had to be wisely and carefully adapted to allow for an expedited evaluation without compromising the thoroughness of the regulatory and scientific assessment. In this review, we describe the regulatory procedures, concepts and requirements applied to guide and promote the highly accelerated development and licensure of safe and efficacious COVID‐19 vaccines in Europe.","Wagner, Ralf; Meißner, Juliane; Grabski, Elena; Sun, Yuansheng; Vieths, Stefan; Hildt, Eberhard",Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33887070/; https://doi.org/10.1111/all.14868,150
674525,The fecal virome of domesticated animals,2014-02-01,"Systemic autoimmune disorders are complex heterogeneous chronic diseases involving many different immune cells. A significant proportion of patients respond poorly to therapy. In addition, the high burden of adverse effects caused by “classical” anti-rheumatic or immune modulatory drugs provides a need to develop more specific therapies that are better tolerated. Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a crucial signaling protein that directly links B-cell receptor (BCR) signals to B-cell activation, proliferation, and survival. BTK is not only expressed in B cells but also in myeloid cells, and is involved in many different signaling pathways that drive autoimmunity. This makes BTK an interesting therapeutic target in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The past decade has seen the emergence of first-line BTK small-molecule inhibitors with great efficacy in the treatment of B-cell malignancies, but with unfavorable safety profiles for use in autoimmunity due to off-target effects. The development of second-generation BTK inhibitors with superior BTK specificity has facilitated the investigation of their efficacy in clinical trials with autoimmune patients. In this review, we discuss the role of BTK in key signaling pathways involved in autoimmunity and provide an overview of the different inhibitors that are currently being investigated in clinical trials of systemic autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as available results from completed trials.","Neys, Stefan F.

675074,New Insights in Therapy for Food Allergy,2021-05-10,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), is a pandemic with no specific therapeutic agents and substantial mortality, and finding new treatments is critical. Most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or ventilator support. This respiratory compromise appears to be due to a hyperimmune reaction, often called a cytokine storm. Vagus nerve stimulation has been demonstrated to block production of cytokines in sepsis and other medical conditions. We hypothesize that non‐invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) might provide clinical benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with COVID‐19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on two case reports was obtained via email correspondence and phone interviews with the patients. RESULTS: Both patients reported clinically meaningful benefits from nVNS therapy. In case 1, the patient used nVNS to expedite symptomatic recovery at home after hospital discharge and was able to discontinue use of opioid and cough suppressant medications. In case 2, the patient experienced immediate and consistent relief from symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as an improved ability to clear his lungs. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary observations and a strong scientific foundation suggest that nVNS might provide clinical benefits in patients with COVID‐19 via multiple mechanisms.","Staats, Peter; Giannakopoulos, Georgios; Blake, Justyna; Liebler, Eric; Levy, Robert M.",Neuromodulation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342609/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ner.13172,150

The selected secondary metabolites have been experimentally validated and reported as potent antiviral agents against genetically-close human viruses. The plants have also been used as a folk medicine to treat cold, cough, asthma, bronchitis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome in India and across the globe since time immemorial. The present study aimed to assess the repurposing possibility of potent antiviral compounds with SARS-CoV-2 target proteins and also with host-specific receptor and activator protease that facilitates the viral entry into the host body. Molecular docking (MDc) was performed to study molecular affinities of antiviral compounds with aforesaid target proteins. The top-scoring conformations identified through docking analysis were further validated by 100 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulation run. The stability of the conformation was studied in detail by investigating the binding free energy using MM-PBSA method. Finally, the binding affinities of all the compounds were also compared with a reference ligand, remdesivir, against the target protein RdRp. Additionally, pharmacophore features, 3D structure alignment of potent compounds and Bayesian machine learning model were also used to support the MDc and MD simulation. Overall, the study emphasized that curcumin possesses a strong binding ability with host-specific receptors, furin and ACE2. In contrast, gingerol has shown strong interactions with spike protein, and RdRp and quercetin with main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2. In fact, all these target proteins play an essential role in mediating viral replication, and therefore, compounds targeting aforesaid target proteins are expected to block the viral replication and transcription. Overall, gingerol, curcumin and quercetin own multitarget binding ability that can be used alone or in combination to enhance therapeutic efficacy against COVID-19. The obtained results encourage further in vitro and in vivo investigations and also support the traditional use of antiviral plants preventively.","Kumar Verma, Akalesh; Kumar, Vikas; Singh, Sweta; Goswami, Bhabesh Ch.; Camps, Ihosvany; Sekar, Aishwarya; Yoon, Sanghwa; Lee, Keun Woo",Biomed Pharmacother,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001414?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33561649/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111356; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332221001414,150

The molecular testing is the accepted assay in SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, there are several reasons for low sensitivity by RNA detection, causing challenges in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate serological patterns of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM, and IgG in 111 hospitalized, and 34 recovered COVID-19 patients and 311 prepandemic normal serum specimens by ELISA. The validity of the ELISA kits was evaluated using samples from normal and recovered cases. This showed that 98.1%, and 98.4% of prepandemic normal samples were negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, and IgG, respectively. Assessment of 34 COVID-19 confirmed recovered patients showed a test sensitivity of 76.5%, and 94.1% for IgM, and IgG, respectively. In COVID-19 hospitalized patients, 42.3%, and 51.4% were positive for IgM and IgG, respectively. Viral RNA was not detectable in 43.3% of the hospitalized patients.

The objective of this paper is to present first impressions of this transformation. METHODS –: Using over-the-phone instructions initially, all patients were able to participate with the online therapy program. To reduce screen-time for patients, the non-verbal therapies were shortened. Four patients, aged 64-70 years, started our online program. RESULTS –: Therapists were positive about the online capabilities and resilience of patients to adapt to the new situation. Prejudices on limited effectiveness of online psychotherapy were counteracted. Sending homework by email and mail seems to facilitate therapy adherence. Non-verbal therapy could be important to stimulate the online group process. CONCLUSIONS –: We were positively surprised by the online capabilities of our geriatric mental health care patients and encourage further formal effectiveness studies.","van Dijk, S.D.M.; Bouman, R.; Folmer, E.H.; den Held, R.C.; Warringa, J.E.; Marijnissen, R.M.; Voshaar, R.C.

In this study, cone beam CT (CBCT) was used to investigate the effect of surgical mask on setup errors in head and neck radiotherapy. METHODS: A total of 91 patients with head and neck tumors were selected. CBCT was performed to localize target volume after patient set up. The images obtained by CBCT before treatment were automatically registered with CT images and manually fine-tuned. The setup errors of patients in 6 directions of Vrt, Lng, Lat, Pitch, Roll and Rotation were recorded. The patients were divided into groups according to whether they wore the surgical mask, the type of immobilization mask used and the location of the isocenter. The setup errors of patients were calculated. A t-test was performed to detect whether it was statistically significant. RESULTS: In the 4 groups, the standard deviation in the directions of Lng and Pitch of the with surgical mask group were all higher than that in the without surgical mask group. In the head-neck-shoulder mask group, the mean in the Lng direction of the with surgical mask group was larger than that of the without surgical mask group. In the lateral isocenter group, the mean in the Lng and Pitch directions of the with surgical mask group were larger than that of the without surgical mask group. The t-test results showed that there was significant difference in the setup error between the 2 groups (p = 0.043 and p = 0.013, respectively) only in the Lng and Pitch directions of the head-neck-shoulder mask group. In addition, the setup error of 6 patients with immobilization open masks exhibited no distinguished difference from that of the patients with regular immobilization masks. CONCLUSION: In the head and neck radiotherapy patients, the setup error was affected by wearing surgical mask. It is recommended that the immobilization open mask should be used when the patient cannot finish the whole treatment with a surgical mask.","Ding, Yi; Ma, Pingping; Li, Wei; Wei, Xueyan; Qiu, Xiaoping; Hu, Desheng; Wu, Yuan; Wei, Wei; Zeng, Fanyu; Wang, Xiaohong; Wang, Xiao",Technol Cancer Res Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33327884/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1533033820974021,150

683129,Massive peptide sharing between viral and human proteomes,2008-06-05,"Background: Healthcare workers are frontline responders facing a disproportionate increase in occupational responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Added work-related stress among healthcare personnel may lead to personal and work-related repercussions, such as burnout or decreased quality of care for patients; however, little is known about how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the daily work and life of these workers. This study aimed to evaluate the personal and occupational impacts of the COVID-19 induced partial lockdown in Vietnam among hospital staff. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based study was carried out to collect demographic data and the personal and job impacts of respondents during the second week of national lockdown in April 2020. Snowball sampling technique was applied to recruit 742 hospital staff. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to examine the validity of the instrument. Results: Of the 742 respondents, 21.2% agreed that “working attitude well-maintained,” followed by 16.1% of respondents who reported that there were “enough employees at work.” Only 3.2% of respondents agreed that “their work was appreciated by society.” Furthermore, healthcare workers in the central region were less likely to have experienced “Avoidance of disclosure and discrimination related to COVID-19” than other areas (Coef. = – 0.25, CI: −0.42 to −0.07). Being women also had a negative association with scores in “Avoidance of disclosure and discrimination related to COVID 19” domain (Coef. = −0.27, CI: −0.43 to −0.12) while having a positive association with “negative attitude towards working conditions” domain (Coef. = 0.19, CI: 0.09 to 0.3). In addition, working in administrative offices (Coef. = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.36) and infectious departments (Coef. = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.09 to 0.63) had a positive association with “Increased work pressure due to COVID 19” domain. Conclusion: These findings revealed marginal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the work and life of hospital staff in Vietnam. Furthermore, this study highlighted the importance of implementing preventive strategies during the nationwide partial lockdown to manage hospital admissions and the burden on healthcare workers.

Prior research examining factors associated with antibiotic self-medication has focused on an individual’s knowledge about antibiotics, antibiotic usage practices, accessibility to antibiotic medication, and demographic characteristics. The role of psychological distress associated with perceived health risks in explaining antibiotic self-medication is less understood. This study was designed to address this knowledge gap in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. An online survey of 2217 participants was conducted at the height of the initial outbreak and revealed that 19.5% of participants took antibiotics to protect themselves from COVID-19. Multivariate logistic analysis examined the predictors of taking antibiotics for protection against COVID-19. An integrative framework developed from the results illustrates potential pathways and facilitating factors that may contribute to prophylactic self-medication with antibiotics. Specifically, COVID-19 pandemic-induced psychological distress was significantly positively related to self-medication. Preventive use of antibiotics was also facilitated by a lack of understanding about antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotics usage practices, the nature of the patient-doctor relationship, and demographic characteristics. The findings highlight that to combat antimicrobial resistance due to self-medication, interventions need to focus on interrupting entrenched behavioural responses and addressing emotional responses to perceived health risks.","Zhang, Airong; Hobman, Elizabeth V.; De Barro, Paul; Young, Asaesja; Carter, David J.; Byrne, Mitchell",Antibiotics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10030232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33668953/,150

The purpose of this study is to measure preferences for properties of GBCM in women at intermediate or high risk of breast cancer undergoing annual screening MRI. METHODS: An institutional reviewed board-approved prospective discrete choice conjoint survey was administered to patients at intermediate or high risk for breast cancer undergoing screening MRI at 4 institutions (July 2018–March 2020). Participants were given 15 tasks and asked to choose which of two hypothetical GBCM they would prefer. GBCMs varied by the following attributes: sensitivity for cancer detection (80–95%), intracranial gadolinium retention (1–100 molecules per 100 million administered), severe allergic-like reaction rate (1–19 per 100,000 administrations), mild allergic-like reaction rate (10–1000 per 100,000 administrations), out-of-pocket cost ($25–$100). Attribute levels were based on published values of existing GBCMs. Hierarchical Bayesian analysis was used to derive attribute “importance.” Preference shares were determined by simulation. RESULTS: Response (87% [247/284]) and completion (96% [236/247]) rates were excellent. Sensitivity (importance = 44.3%, 95% confidence interval = 42.0–46.7%) was valued more than GBCM-related risks (mild allergic-like reaction risk (19.5%, 17.9–21.1%), severe allergic-like reaction risk (17.0%, 15.8–18.1%), intracranial gadolinium retention (11.6%, 10.5–12.7%), out-of-pocket expense (7.5%, 6.8–8.3%)). Lower income participants placed more importance on cost and less on sensitivity (p < 0.01). A simulator is provided that models GBCM preference shares by GBCM attributes and competition. CONCLUSIONS: Patients at intermediate or high risk for breast cancer undergoing MRI screening prioritize cancer detection over GBCM-related risks, and prioritize reaction risks over gadolinium retention. KEY POINTS: • Among women undergoing annual breast MRI screening, cancer detection sensitivity (attribute “importance,” 44.3%) was valued more than GBCM-related risks (mild allergic reaction risk 19.5%, severe allergic reaction risk 17.0%, intracranial gadolinium retention 11.6%, out-of-pocket expense 7.5%). • Prospective four-center patient preference data have been incorporated into a GBCM choice simulator that allows users to input GBCM properties and calculate patient preference shares for competitor GBCMs. • Lower-income women placed more importance on out-of-pocket cost and less importance on cancer detection (p < 0.01) when prioritizing GBCM properties.

A review of the literature was conducted to assess the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of creatine supplementation on rehabilitation from immobilization and injury, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiopulmonary disease, and other muscular disorders. Several of the findings are encouraging, showcasing creatine’s potential efficacy as a supplemental agent via preservation of muscle mass, strength, and physical function; however, the results are not consistent. For multiple diseases, only a few creatine studies with small sample sizes have been published, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Rationale for discordant findings is further complicated by differences in disease pathologies, intervention protocols, creatine dosing and duration, and patient population. While creatine supplementation demonstrates promise as a therapeutic aid, more research is needed to fill gaps in knowledge within medical rehabilitation.","Harmon, Kylie K.; Stout, Jeffrey R.; Fukuda, David H.; Pabian, Patrick S.; Rawson, Eric S.; Stock, Matt S.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071875/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13061825,150

In a series of studies about preference for public health leadership advice, we asked 1,061 participants to choose between (1) strict advice that is medically optimal if adhered to but which is less likely to be broadly followed, and (2) relaxed advice, which is less medically effective but more likely to gain adherence - given varying infection expectancies. Participants' preference was consistent with risk aversion. Offering an informed choice alternative that shifts volition to advice recipients only strengthened risk aversion, but also demonstrated that informed choice was preferred as much or more than the risk-averse strict advice.","Nov, O.; Dove, G.; Balestra, M.; Lawrence, K.; Mann, D.; Wiesenfeld, B.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251765v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.15.21251765,150

The patterns of healthcare utilization change during pandemic disease outbreaks. Identifying the patterns of changes of this particular fragile subpopulation is important for future preparedness and response. Overcrowding in the emergency department (ED) can occur because of the volume of patients waiting to be seen, delays in patient assessment or treatment in the ED, or impediments to leaving the ED once the treatment has been completed. Overcrowding has become a serious and growing issue globally, which represents a serious impediment to healthcare utilization. To estimate the rate of ED visits attributable to the outbreak and guide the planning of strategies for managing ED access or after the outbreak of transmittable respiratory diseases. This observational study was based on a retrospective review of the epidemiological and clinical records of patients aged > 75 years who visited the Foundation IRCCS Policlinic San Matteo during the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak (February 21 to May 1, 2020; pandemic group). The analysis methods included estimation of the changes in the epidemiological and clinical data from the annual baseline data after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome measures and analysis: Primary objective is the evaluation of ED admission rate change and ED overcrowding. Secondary objectives are the evaluation of modes of ED access by reason and triage code, access types, clinical outcomes (such as admission and mortality rates). During the pandemic, ED crowding increased dramatically, although the overall number of patients decreased, in the face of a percentage increase in those with high-acuity conditions, because of changes in patient management that have prolonged length of stay (LOS) and increased rates of access block. Overcrowding during the COVID-19 pandemic can be attributed to the Access Block. Access Block solutions are hence required to prevent a recurrence of crowding to any new viral wave or new epidemic in the future.

After residents settled and further explanation of the study given (approximately 15 min), measurements included: tympanic membrane temperature, thermal sensation rating and infrared thermal mapping of non-dominant hand and forearm. Sixty-nine afebrile adults (60–101 years of age) were studied in groups of two to five, in mean ambient temperatures of 21.4–26.6 °C (median 23.6 °C). Significant differences were observed between groups; thermal sensation rating (p = 0.02), tympanic temperature (p = 0.01), fingertip skin temperature (p = 0.01) and temperature gradients; fingertip-wrist p = 0.001 and fingertip-distal forearm, p = 0.001. Residents with dementia were in significantly lower air temperatures (p = 0.001). Although equal numbers of residents per group rated the environment as ‘neutral’ (comfortable), resident ratings for ‘cool/cold’ were more frequent amongst those with dementia compared with no dementia. In parallel, extremity (hand) thermograms revealed visual temperature demarcation, variously across fingertip, wrist, and forearm commensurate with peripheral vasoconstriction. Infrared thermography provided a quantitative and qualitative method to measure and observe hand skin temperature across multiple regions of interest alongside thermal sensation self-report. As an imaging modality, infrared thermography has potential as an additional assessment technology with clinical utility to identify vulnerable residents who may be unable to communicate verbally, or reliably, their satisfaction with indoor environmental conditions.","Childs, Charmaine; Elliott, Jennifer; Khatab, Khaled; Hampshaw, Susan; Fowler-Davis, Sally; Willmott, Jon R.; Ali, Ali",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32971989/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186932,150

Safe and effective antivirals are not available, particularly for chronically infected immunocompromised individuals, and for prophylactic applications to protect high‐risk and vulnerable populations in outbreak settings. Since the discovery of human norovirus in 1972, the lack of a cell culture system has hindered biological research and antiviral studies for many years. Recent breakthroughs in culturing human norovirus have been encouraging, however, further development and optimization of these novel methodologies are required to facilitate more robust replication levels, that will enable reliable serological and replication studies, as well as advances in antiviral development. In the last few years, considerable progress has been made toward the development of norovirus antivirals, inviting an updated review. This review focuses on potential therapeutics that have been reported since 2010, which were examined across at least two model systems used for studying human norovirus or its enzymes.

689446,Deepen the understanding and communication of animal models and experimental medicine research studies,2021-03-12,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about COVID-19 outside Hubei. The aim of this paper was to describe the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 149 RT-PCR confirmed positive patients were consecutively enrolled from January 17th to February 10th, 2020 in three tertiary hospitals of Wenzhou. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 15th, 2020. FINDINGS: A total of 85 patients had Hubei travel/residence history, while another 49 had contact with people from Hubei and 15 had no traceable exposure history to Hubei. Fever, cough and expectoration were the most common symptoms, 14 patients had decreased oxygen saturation, 33 had leukopenia, 53 had lymphopenia, and 82 had elevated C-reactive protein. On chest computed tomography (CT), lung segments 6 and 10 were mostly involved. A total of 287 segments presented ground glass opacity, 637 presented mixed opacity and 170 presented consolidation. Lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung with a patchy form. No significant difference was found between patients with or without Hubei exposure history. Seventeen patients had normal CT on admission of these, 12 had negative findings even10 days later. INTERPRETATION: Most patients presented with a mild infection in our study. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed opacity with predominance in the lower lung is highly suspicious of COVID-19 in the first week of disease onset. Nevetheless, some patients can present with a normal chest finding despite testing positive for COVID-19. Funding: We did not receive any fundings.","Yang, Wenjie; Cao, Qiqi; Qin, Le; Wang, Xiaoyang; Cheng, Zenghui; Pan, Ashan; Dai, Jianyi; Sun, Qingfeng; Zhao, Fengquan; Qu, Jieming; Yan, Fuhua",J Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320300992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32112884/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320300992; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.016,150

The clinical laboratory center of Leishenshan Hospital (CLCLH) was constructed at the same time within 11 days to support the treatment of inpatients in Leishenshan Hospital and the testing of suspected patients from different fever clinics in Wuhan. The CLCLH could perform a total of 320 clinic, 299 biochemistry, 31 microorganism, and 47 infection and immunity examinations per day. It could also complete an average of 239 nucleic acid tests and 118 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody examinations per day. No suspected cases were documented among the health care workers during the operation of the CLCLH. The construction and operation experiences of the CLCLH is provided in this study and might be used by other countries as reference. The content of this study is divided into 4 parts: (1) the establishment of the CLCLH, including its layout and medical resource allocation; (2) the major testing items; (3) the specific procedure of COVID-19 indicator examination; and (4) the standardized personal protection measures.","Xie, Yaofei; Wu, Wenwen; Xie, Wen; Jin, Yi; Tan, Xiaodong",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32782047/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.293,150
690323,Adjuvants and adjuvanticity,2020-07-10,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) represents a significantly economical challenge to the swine industry worldwide. In this study, we investigated the importance of cellular and viral lipid rafts in PRRSV infection. First, we demonstrated that PRRSV glycoproteins, Gp3 and Gp4, were associated with lipid rafts during viral entry, and disruption of cellular lipid rafts inhibited PRRSV entry. We also showed the raft-location of CD163, which might contribute to the glycoproteins–raft association. Subsequently, raft disruption caused a significant reduction of viral RNA production. Moreover, Nsp9 was shown to be distributed in rafts, suggesting that rafts probably serve as a platform for PRRSV replication. Finally, we confirmed that disassembly of rafts on the virus envelope may affect the integrity of PRRSV particles and cause the leakage of viral proteins, which impaired PRRSV infectivity. These findings might provide insights on our understanding of the mechanism of PRRSV infection.","Yang, Qian; Zhang, Qiong; Tang, Jun; Feng, Wen-hai",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682215002822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26115164/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.06.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215002822,150
690413,Exacerbations: Etiology and Pathophysiologic Mechanisms,2015-12-16,"OBJECTIVE: The novel coronavirus (2019; CV-19) is linked to increases in emotional distress and may be particularly problematic for those with pre-existing mental and physical conditions, such as chronic pain and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, little empirical research has been published on resilience factors in these individuals. The present study aims to examine authenticity as a resilience factor among those with chronic pain and/or PTSD. METHODS: Prior to the national response to the pandemic (January 10-24, 2020), participants were screened for pain-related disability (Oswestry Disability Index; ODI) and PTSD symptoms (Posttraumatic Checklist for DSM-5; PCL-5), and on the basis of those responses were categorized into one of four groups: healthy, chronic pain only, PTSD only, or comorbid chronic pain and PTSD. During the CV-19 pandemic (May 5-May 13, 2020), participants responded again to the ODI and PCL-5, in addition to the Wood Authenticity Scale, Brief Pain Inventory, and items related to the CV-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 110 participants (54.55% women), aged 42.19 (SD = 13.16), completed the survey during the pandemic. The comorbid group endorsed higher levels of CV-19 Threat and Impact compared to all other groups. Authenticity moderated this relationship relevant to CV-19 Threat among those in the chronic pain only group, and not in any other group. CONCLUSION: The comorbid group endorsed higher levels of CV-19 Threat and Impact compared to all other groups. Importantly, greater authenticity was associated with less CV-19 Threat in the chronic pain only group, and not in any other group. The present study also highlights the importance of engaging authentically for those with chronic pain during the pandemic.","Reed, David E.; Lehinger, Elizabeth; Cobos, Briana; Vail, Kenneth E.; Nabity, Paul S.; Helm, Peter J.; Galgali, Madhwa S.; McGeary, Donald D.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995199/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.643869,150
