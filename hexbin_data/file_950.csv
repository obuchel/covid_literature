The British theatre group Forced Entertainment provides a contemporary example of a (post-)avant-garde vocabulary that actively borrows from and transforms the practices of their precursors. They employ a palimpsest-like layering of visual and verbal elements, which I will here define as performative meta-collages. In this article, I will discuss their practice and take a look at the ways in which Forced Entertainment's performative meta-collages verbalize and produce ""future"" in one of their recent performances, End Meeting for All, which imagines a scenario that takes place ""a year and a day"" after the beginning of the COVID-19-triggered lockdown in the spring of 2020.","Tamas, L.",Journal of Contemporary Drama in English,950,16

Worryingly, the QAnon conspiracy theory has implications in the real world, with supporters of the theory participating in real-world violent acts like the US capitol attack in 2021. At the same time, the QAnon theory started evolving into a global phenomenon by attracting followers across the globe and, in particular, in Europe. Therefore, it is imperative to understand how the QAnon theory became a worldwide phenomenon and how this dissemination has been happening in the online space. This paper performs a large-scale data analysis of QAnon through Telegram by collecting 4.5M messages posted in 161 QAnon groups/channels. Using Google's Perspective API, we analyze the toxicity of QAnon content across languages and over time. Also, using a BERT-based topic modeling approach, we analyze the QAnon discourse across multiple languages. Among other things, we find that the German language is prevalent in QAnon groups/channels on Telegram, even overshadowing English after 2020. Also, we find that content posted in German and Portuguese tends to be more toxic compared to English. Our topic modeling indicates that QAnon supporters discuss various topics of interest within far-right movements, including world politics, conspiracy theories, COVID-19, and the anti-vaccination movement. Taken all together, we perform the first multilingual study on QAnon through Telegram and paint a nuanced overview of the globalization of the QAnon theory.","Hoseini, Mohamad; Melo, Philipe; Benevenuto, Fabricio; Feldmann, Anja; Zannettou, Savvas",,950,1

It causes a devastating impact on the lifestyle, public health, and the global economy. This motivates the researchers to invent and develop innovative and automated methods to detect COVID-19 at its early stages. It is necessary to isolate the positive cases quickly to prevent this epidemic and treat affected patients. Many diagnosis methods are proposed to perform accurate and fast detection for COVID-19, such as Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT -PCR). The clinical studies indicate that the severity of COVID-19 cases depends on the virus's amount within infected lungs. Chest X-ray (CXR) and Computed Tomography (CT) images are useful imaging methods for diagnosing COVID-19 cases. Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is a machine learning technique usually used in computer vision applications. This review focuses on utilizing the DCNN methods for building an automated Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADs) system to detect and classify the infected cases of the COVID-19 disease accurately and fast. These techniques are used to extracts valuable information by analyzing a massive amount of CXR and CT images that can critically impact on screening of Covid-19. DCNN techniques proved their robustness, potentiality, and advancement by comparing them among the other learning algorithms.

Despite improved understanding, the duration of host immunity following COVID-19 infection and role of serological testing alone or in addition to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing in the HD population is not fully understood, which this study aimed to investigate. METHODS: There were two parts to this study. Between 15th March 2020 to 15th July 2020, patients receiving HD who tested positive on rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were recruited into the COVID-19 arm, whilst asymptomatic patients without a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were recruited to the epidemiological arm of the Salford Kidney Study (SKS). All patients underwent monthly testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as per routine clinical practice since August 2020. The aims were twofold: firstly, to determine seroprevalence and COVID-19 exposure in the epidemiological arm; secondly, to assess duration of the antibody response in the COVID-19 arm. Baseline characteristics were reviewed between groups. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Mann-Whitney U and Chi-squared tests were used for testing significance of difference between groups. RESULTS: In our total HD population of 411 patients, 32 were PCR-positive for COVID-19. Of the remaining patients, 237 were recruited into the SKS study, of whom 12 (5.1%) had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of the 32 PCR-positive patients, 27 (84.4%) were symptomatic and 25 patients admitted to hospital due to their symptoms. Of the 22 patients in COVID-19 arm that underwent testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies beyond 7 months, all had detectable antibodies. A higher proportion of the patients with COVID-19 were frail compared to patients without a diagnosis of COVID-19 (64.3% vs 34.1%, p = 0.003). Other characteristics were similar between the groups. Over a median follow up of 7 months, a higher number of deaths were recorded in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 compared to those without (18.7% vs 5.9%, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Serological testing in the HD population is a valuable tool to determine seroprevalence, monitor exposure, and guide improvements for infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to help prevent local outbreaks. This study revealed HD patients mount a humoral response detectable until at least 7 months after COVID-19 infection and provides hope of similar protection with the vaccines recently approved.","Wickens, Olivia; Chinnadurai, Rajkumar; Mannan, Fahmida; Svendsen, Frida; Baig, Mirza Yasar; Chukwu, Chukwuma; Ali, Ibrahim; Summersgill, Christina; Evans, Dawn; Antoine, Berckley V; Oxton, Julie; Mairs, Nathan; Flanagan, Emma; Oliver, Robert; Kalra, Philip A; Poulikakos, Dimitrios",BMC Nephrol,950,20

Underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with severe COVID-19 infection and adverse clinical outcomes. While COVID-19 predominantly causes respiratory symptoms, a substantial number of patients eventually develop an acute cardiovascular syndrome associated with an excessive risk of mortality. While the exact mechanisms remain uncertain, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 plays a pivotal role as a link between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system. As there is no evidence that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system is harmful in COVID-19, therapy should be continued as indicated in hypertension or heart failure patients. As multiple drugs are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials, potential cardiotoxicity remains an important issue. In times of rigorous public health measures such as social distancing, efforts should be undertaken to ensure timely treatment of acute CVD and continuation of guideline-directed treatment in order to avoid an increase in morbidity and mortality. In addition to its acute complications, COVID-19 is likely to be associated with long-term cardiovascular damage. Consequently, for a subgroup of patients a long-term management strategy is needed.","Seoudy, Hatim; Frey, Norbert",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,950,6

Previous studies reported mixed results regarding clinical outcome during quarantine in patients with migraine. In particular, data from areas strongly affetcted by COVID-19 pandemic are missing. METHODS: One-hundred and seventy patients, previously assessed at the Headache Centre - ASST Spedali Civili Brescia, underwent a telephonic interview regarding migraine features and clinical, occupational and lifestyle variables. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, during quarantine, we found a significant overall reduction in migraine days (14.7±0.6 vs 12.3±0.7, p <0.001), with 47.1% patients reporting a clinical improvement. Outdoor living spaces (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.7-3.07, p = 0.009), a positive attitude throughout quarantine (OR 4.12, 95% CI 2.3-7.1, p = 0.03), working full-time (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.5-1.9, p < 0.001) and a baseline diagnosis of chronic migraine (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-2.02, p = 0.002) were associated with an increased chance of migraine improvement.

PurposeTo screen the phytochemicals for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 in silico and evaluate their safety and efficacy in vitro and in vivo. MethodThe phytochemicals for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 were screened in silico using molecular docking. The hits generated from in silico screening were subjected for extraction, isolation and purification. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of plant extracts of Z. piperitum (ATRI-CoV-E1), W. somnifera (ATRI-CoV-E2), C. inophyllum (ATRI-CoV-E3), A. paniculata (ATRI-CoV-E4), and C. Asiatica (ATRI-CoV-E5). The in vitro safety and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of plant extracts were performed in VeroE6 cells using Remdesivir as positive control. The acute and sub-acute toxicity study was performed in Wistar male and female rats. ResultsThe percentage of cell viability for ATRI-COV-E4, ATRI-COV-E5 and ATRI-COV-E2 treated VeroE6 cells were remarkably good on the 24th and 48th hour of treatment. The in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of ATRI-COV-E4, ATRI-COV-E5 and ATRI-COV-E2 were significant for both E gene and N gene. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition for ATRI-COV-E4 was better than Remdesivir.

This study aimed to identify the magnitude, characteristics and underlying motivations of ED visitors with delayed healthcare seeking behaviour during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: Between March 9 and July 92,020, adults visiting the ED of an academic hospital in the East of the Netherlands received an online questionnaire to collect self-reported data on delay in seeking emergency care and subsequent motivations for this delay. Telephone interviews were held with a subsample of respondents to better understand the motivations for delay as described in the questionnaire. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were thematically analysed. RESULTS: One thousand three hundred thirty-eight questionnaires were returned (34.0% response). One in five respondents reported a delay in seeking emergency care. Almost half of these respondents (n = 126; 45.4%) reported that the pandemic influenced the delay. Respondents reporting delay were mainly older adults (mean 61.6; ±13.1 years), referred to the ED by the general practitioner (GP; 35.1%) or a medical specialist (34.7%), visiting the ED with cardiac problems (39.7%). The estimated median time of delay in receiving ED care was 3 days (inter quartile range 8 days). Respectively 46 (16.5%) and 26 (9.4%) respondents reported that their complaints would be either less severe or preventable if they had sought for emergency care earlier. Delayed care seeking behaviour was frequently motivated by: fear of contamination, not wanting to burden professionals, perceiving own complaints less urgent relative to COVID-19 patients, limited access to services, and by stay home instructions from referring professionals. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively large proportion of ED visitors reported delay in seeking emergency care during the first wave. Delay was often driven by misperceptions of the accessibility of services and the legitimacy for seeking emergency care. Public messaging and close collaboration between the ED and referring professionals could help reduce delayed care for acute needs during future COVID-19 infection waves.","Nab, Maaike; van Vehmendahl, Robyn; Somers, Inne; Schoon, Yvonne; Hesselink, Gijs",BMC Emerg Med,950,30

After a slowdown in the epidemic, on 6 May, 2020, the regulatory authorities decided to relax the implemented measures. However, the epidemiological situation soon worsened again. As of 7 February, 2021, a total of 406,352 cases of SARSCov-2 infection have been reported in Serbia, 4,112 deaths caused by COVID-19. In order to better understand the epidemic dynamics and predict possible outcomes, we have developed an adaptive mathematical model SEAIHRDS (S-susceptible, E-exposed, A-asymptomatic, I-infected, H-hospitalized, R-recovered, D-dead due to COVID-19 infection, S-susceptible). The model can be used to simulate various scenarios of the implemented intervention measures and calculate possible epidemic outcomes, including the necessary hospital capacities. Considering promising results regarding the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, the model is extended to simulate vaccination among different population strata. The findings from various simulation scenarios have shown that, with implementation of strict measures of contact reduction, it is possible to control COVID-19 and reduce number of deaths. The findings also show that limiting effective contacts within the most susceptible population strata merits a special attention. However, the findings also show that the disease has a potential to remain in the population for a long time, likely with a seasonal pattern. If a vaccine, with efficacy equal or higher than 65%, becomes available it could help to significantly slow down or completely stop circulation of the virus in human population. The effects of vaccination depend primarily on: 1. Efficacy of available vaccine(s), 2. Prioritization of the population categories for vaccination, and 3. Overall vaccination coverage of the population, assuming that the vaccine(s) develop solid immunity in vaccinated individuals. With expected basic reproduction number of Ro=2.46 and vaccine efficacy of 68%, an 87% coverage would be sufficient to stop the virus circulation.","Stanojevic, Slavoljub; Ponjavic, Mirza; Stanojevic, Slobodan; Stevanovic, Aleksandar; Radojicic, Sonja",Microb Risk Anal,950,18

However, little is known about the virus-host interaction of COVID-19 in sperm cells. We are the first to address the connection between changes in multiple seminal biomarkers and reproductive function in male patients recovering from COVID-19. In a prospective longitudinal cohort study, seminal ACE2 activity, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, apoptotic variables, and semen quality parameters were evaluated at 10-day intervals for a maximum follow-up time of 60 days among male patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (n = 84) and healthy controls (CON; n = 105). At the baseline and the subsequent follow-ups, the COVID-19 group revealed significantly higher levels of seminal plasma ACE2 enzymatic activity, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TGF-ß, TNF-&#945;, IFN-&#945;, IFN-Î³, ROS, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activity as well as lower levels of SOD activity than those in the CON group (P < 0.05). These perturbations tended to persist over time and were correlated with significant impairments in semen volume, progressive motility, sperm morphology, sperm concentration, and the number of spermatozoa. We provide the direct experimental evidence that the male reproductive system could be targeted and damaged by the COVID-19 infection. These findings go beyond our current understanding of the disease, suggesting that the reproductive function of the patients recovering from the disease should be precisely followed and evaluated to detect and avoid more serious reproductive problems in the future, as they may develop a transient state of male subfertility like those with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia.","Hajizadeh Maleki, Behzad; Tartibian, Bakhtyar",Reproduction,950,26

This is an observational study about the use of teledermatology during the pandemic in the area of connective tissue diseases in a public hospital in Buenos Aires City. The main objective was to assess if teledermatology is useful to resolve patient's consultation and thus to avoid the referral to the hospital. There were 120 teledermatological consultations included, from which 93.3% were made by women. The average age was 38.4 years. The 57.5% of the consultations were from patients of the outskirts of Buenos Aires and 33.3% from Buenos Aires City. The 47.5% of consultations were from patients with no medical insurance. Of the total, 17 (14.2%) required referral to a health center. Most of the consultations were follow-up's and in a lower percentage, due to reactivation of the underlying disease or another reason. Patients who completed the survey reported not having difficulties and were able to resolve their consultations through virtual care.

The computer-assisted web interviewing (CAWI) technique was used to collect data from 1033 Polish adults in March 2020. Logistic regression was used to estimate the likelihood of fear of limited access to food and the likelihood of purchase of larger amounts of food than usual. The likelihood of experiencing fear of limited access to food increased by 16% with higher perceived stress, by 50% with higher trust in ""Mass media and friends"", and by 219% with perceived changes in food availability in the previous month. Trust in ""Polish government institutions"" decreased the chance of experiencing such fears by 22%. The likelihood of purchasing larger quantities of food than usual increased by 9% with higher perceived stress, by 46% with higher trust in ""Mass media and friends"", by 81% with perceived changes in food availability in the last month, and by 130% with fears of limited access to food as the pandemic spreads. Government institutions may have difficulty in disseminating pandemic-related recommendations through media, not only due to relatively low trust people have in media organizations but also due to the increasing likelihood of the occurrence of both fears regarding food availability and panic-stricken food-buying behaviors with increase in trust in this source of information. Therefore, it is necessary to develop interventions that will reduce perceived stress and improve the trust in information from reputable sources.","Jezewska-Zychowicz, Marzena; Plichta, Marta; Królak, Maria",Nutrients,950,16

The developed nanocomposite was characterized through the infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analyses. The ternary nanocomposite coating offers the good mechanical and thermal stability and high extraction efficiency thanks to its large specific surface. A central composite statistical design was used to study the main variables affecting the extraction efficiency. Afterwards, to study the relationship between different input and output variables as well as to identify the optimal operating conditions, response surface methodology was used, whereby a second-order polynomial equation was fit to the experimental data. The optimized extraction conditions were as follows: temperature, 70°C; extraction time, 15 min; and concentration of NaCl, 5%w/v. Detection limit of 0.12 ng mL-1 was obtained at the optimized extraction conditions, and the calibration plot was linear in the concentration range of 0.30-200 ng mL-1 .

The 3D structures of fusions were predicted for fused C- or N-terminally PAS sequences in different length to the uricase. The refinement and energy minimization steps revealed that physicochemical and conformational properties of fusions improved while the structures possessed prolonged PAS sequences. Molecular docking results showed that the highest binding affinity to uric acid belonged to uricase-PAS1-100 by the formation of six hydrogen and four non-hydrogen bonds. Altogether, the results indicated that the PASylation process would be promising upon the production of urate oxidase with improved solubility and stability.","Najjari, Abbas; Rahimi, Hamzeh; Nojoumi, Seyed Ali; Omidinia, Eskandar",Int J Mol Cell Med,950,16

Compared with the control group, the nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) content of the bulk soil in the low PFOS (0.1 mg kg-1) treatment significantly decreased (27.7%), the ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) content significantly increased (8.7%), and the pH value and total organic carbon (TOC) content slightly increased (0.3% and 1.1%, respectively). Compared with the low PFOS treatment, the content of NO3-N, NH4+-N and pH value in the bulk soil of the high PFOS treatment (50 mg kg-1) significantly increased (1.0%, 53.8% and 61.8%, respectively), and the TOC content significantly decreased (8.2%). Soil protease levels were high in the low PFOS treatment, but low in the high PFOS treatment. PFOS produced inverted U-shaped responses in the potential nitrification (1.5, 3.0, and 1.1 mg N d-1 kg-1 in no, low, and high PFOS, respectively), denitrification (0.19, 0.30, and 0.22 mg N d-1 kg-1 in no, low, and high PFOS, respectively), and N2O emission rates (0.01, 0.03, and 0.02 mg N d-1 kg-1 in no, low, and high PFOS, respectively) of bulk soil. The abundance of the archaea amoA gene decreased with increasing PFOS concentration, whereas that of bacterial amoA increased; inverted U-shaped responses were observed for narG, nirK, nirS, and nosZ. In the PFOS-contaminated rhizosphere soil, the observed changes differed from those in the bulk soil and differed between treatments. P. communis tended to upregulate each step of the nitrogen cycle under low PFOS conditions, whereas L. salicaria tended to inhibit them. Under high PFOS conditions, both test plants tended to act as inhibitors of the soil N-cycle; thus, the effects of PFOS on soil N transformation were plant-specific.","Lu, Bianhe; Qian, Jin; Wang, Peifang; Wang, Chao; Hu, Jing; Li, Kun; He, Xixian; Jin, Wen",Sci Total Environ,950,23

Anticoagulation (AC) has been proposed for high-risk patients, even without confirmed thromboembolism. However, benefits and risks of AC are not well assessed due to insufficient clinical data. We performed a retrospective analysis of outcomes from AC in a large population of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 1189 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 5 and May 15, 2020, with primary outcomes of mortality, invasive mechanical ventilation, and major bleeding. Patients who received therapeutic AC for known indications were excluded. Propensity score matching of baseline characteristics and admission parameters was performed to minimize bias between cohorts. RESULTS: The analysis cohort included 973 patients. Forty-four patients who received therapeutic AC for confirmed thromboembolic events and atrial fibrillation were excluded. After propensity score matching, 133 patients received empiric therapeutic AC while 215 received low dose prophylactic AC. Overall, there was no difference in the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation (73.7% versus 65.6%, p = 0.133) or mortality (60.2% versus 60.9%, p = 0.885). However, among patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, empiric therapeutic AC was an independent predictor of lower mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.476, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.345-0.657, p &lt; 0.001) with longer median survival (14 days vs 8 days, p &lt; 0.001), but these associations were not observed in the overall cohort (p = 0.063). Additionally, no significant difference in mortality was found between patients receiving empiric therapeutic AC versus prophylactic AC in various subgroups with different D-dimer level cutoffs. Patients who received therapeutic AC showed a higher incidence of major bleeding (13.8% vs 3.9%, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, patients with a HAS-BLED score of ≥2 had a higher risk of mortality (HR 1.482, 95% CI 1.110-1.980, p = 0.008), while those with a score of ≥3 had a higher risk of major bleeding (Odds ratio: 1.883, CI: 1.114-3.729, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Empiric use of therapeutic AC conferred survival benefit to patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, but did not show benefit in non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Careful bleeding risk estimation should be pursued before considering escalation of AC intensity.","Yu, B.; Gutierrez, V. P.; Carlos, A.; Hoge, G.; Pillai, A.; Kelly, J.

Approximately 60% of PCOS women have insulin resistance. While the efficacy of metformin in reducing insulin resistance and decreasing androgen level has been widely validated, there is no agreement on the dose of metformin to be used. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective non-randomized cohort study of 108 insulin resistant, overweight and obese PCOS women, aged between 22 and 35 years. All patients received 1500 mg of metformin (500 mg x 3 times/day) for the first 6 months. At the end of this period, the patients' HOMA index was evaluated. In subjects, who did not demonstrate normalization of the HOMA index, the dose was increased to 2500 mg/day (500 mg at breakfast and 1000 mg at lunch and dinner) for additional 6 months. The hormonal blood profile, fasting insulin and fasting glucose levels, HOMA index, anthropometric assessment, pelvic ultrasound, FAI index and cholesterol were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall results showed a good response to metformin therapy in insulin-resistant PCOS patients with BMI >25, while in patients with higher BMI (31.15 ± 0.40), no normalization of HOMA was found. At the higher dose of metformin, obese patients achieved a good response to therapy, with improvement in BMI, menstrual pattern, cholesterol levels and hyperandrogenism. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a correlation between the required dose of metformin, BMI and hyperandrogenism. The dose of metformin should be adjusted to patients' BMI in order to obtain significant results in terms of clinical, metabolic and hormonal responses.","Morgante, G; Massaro, M G; Scolaro, V; Cappelli, V; Luddi, A; Troìa, L; De Leo, V",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,950,16

This process is time and resource heavy, requiring multiple steps of lysis, extraction, purification, and amplification procedures. Herein, we have developed a method to detect virus off swabs using solely shaker-mill based mechanical lysis and the transfer of the viral lysate directly to a PCR assay for virus detection, bypassing the substantial reagent and time investments required for extraction and purification steps. METHODS: Using Human Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) as a model system, we spiked swabs in vitro for proof-of-concept testing. Swabs were spiked in serial dilutions from 1.2 × 106 to 1.2 × 101 copies/mL and then placed in 2 mL tubes with viral transport media (VTM) to mimic the specimen collection procedures in the clinic prior to processing via shaker-mill homogenization. After homogenization, 1 µL of lysate was processed using RT-qPCR for amplification of the nucleocapsid (N) gene, qualifying viral detection. RESULTS: HCoV-229E in vitro spiked swabs were processed in a novel two-step, direct-to-PCR methodology for viral detection. After running 54 swabs, we confidently determined our limit of detection to be 1.2 × 103 viral copies/mL with 96.30% sensitivity. CONCLUSION: We have proven that the shaker-mill homogenization-based two-step, direct-to-PCR procedures provides sufficient viral lysis off swabs, where the resulting lysate can be used directly in PCR for the detection of HCoV-229E. This finding allows for reductions in the time and resources required for PCR based virus detection in comparison to the traditional extraction-to-PCR methodology.","Morehouse, Zachary P; Proctor, Caleb M; Ryan, Gabriella L; Nash, Rodney J",Virol J,950,23

MethodsSixty-three adults aged 18-60 years, without co-morbidity, with laboratory-confirmed mild COVID-19, were randomized 1:1 to receive APE (60 mg andrographolide, t.i.d, for 5 days) or placebo within 24 hours after admission, plus standard supportive care. The outcomes were clinical recovery rates by Day 5 using self-assessment scores, pneumonia by chest X-rays, nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR on Day 5, changes of serum CRP levels, and adverse drug reactions. Chest X-rays and blood tests for CRP, liver and renal function, were performed on Days 1, 3, and 5. ResultsBaseline characteristics of patients in the APE-treatment (n=29) and placebo-control (n=28) groups were comparable. None had self-assessment scores showing complete clinical recovery by Day 5. Pneumonia occurred in 0/29 (0%) versus 3/28 (10.7%), (p=0.112). On Day 5, patients with SARS-CoV-2 detection were 10/29 (34.5%) versus 16/28 (57.1%), (p=0.086); patients with CRP >10 mg/L were 0/29 (0%) versus 5/28 (17.9%), (p=0.023), for APE-treatment and placebo-control groups, respectively. All three patients with pneumonia had substantially rising serum CRP; and high CRP levels on Day 5. None had evidence of hematologic, hepatic or renal impairment. ConclusionEven though the study was limited by small sample size, our findings suggested promising efficacy and safety of the APE-treatment regimen in adults with mild COVID-19.

However, the immunogenicity of the vector itself decreases its effectiveness as a boosting vaccine due to the induction of strong anti-vector neutralizing immunity. Here we determined how dissolvable microneedle patches (DMN) for skin immunization can overcome this issue, using a clinically-relevant adenovirus-based Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine, AdHu5-PfRH5, in mice. Incorporation of vaccine into patches significantly enhanced its thermostability compared to the liquid form. Conventional high dose repeated immunization by the intramuscular (IM) route induced low antigen-specific IgG titres and high anti-vector immunity. A low priming dose of vaccine, by the IM route, but more so using DMN patches, induced the most efficacious immune responses, assessed by parasite growth inhibitory activity (GIA) assays. Administration of low dose AdHu5-PfRH5 using patches to the skin, boosted by high dose IM, induced the highest antigen-specific serum IgG response after boosting, the greatest skewing of the antibody response towards the antigen and away from the vector, and the highest efficacy. This study therefore demonstrates that repeated use of the same adenovirus vaccine can be highly immunogenic towards the transgene if a low dose is used to prime the response. It also provides a method of stabilizing adenovirus vaccine, in easy-to-administer dissolvable microneedle patches, permitting storage and distribution out of cold chain.","Flynn, Olivia; Dillane, Kate; Lanza, Juliane Sousa; Marshall, Jennifer M; Jin, Jing; Silk, Sarah E; Draper, Simon J; Moore, Anne C",,950,2

MCR-3 generally mediates low-level (&#8804;8 mg L-1 ) colistin resistance among Enterobacteriaceae, but occasionally confers high-level (>128 mg L-1 ) resistance in aeromonads. Herein, it is determined that MCR-3, together with another lipid A modification mediated by the arnBCADTEF operon, may be responsible for high-level colistin resistance in aeromonads. Lipid A is the critical site of pathogens for Toll-like receptor 4 recognizing. However, it is unknown whether or how MCR-3-mediated lipid A modification affects the host immune response. Compared with the wild-type strains, increased mortality is observed in mice intraperitoneally-infected with mcr-3-positive Aeromonas salmonicida and Escherichia coli strains, along with sepsis symptoms. Further, mcr-3-positive strains show decreased clearance rates than wild-type strains, leading to bacterial accumulation in organs. The increased mortality is tightly associated with the increased tissue hypoxia, injury, and post-inflammation. MCR-3 expression also impairs phagocytosis efficiency both in vivo and in vitro, contributing to the increased persistence of mcr-3-positive bacteria in tissues compared with parental strains. This study, for the first time, reveals a dual function of MCR-3 in bacterial resistance and pathogenicity, which calls for caution in treating the infections caused by mcr-positive pathogens.","Yin, Wenjuan; Ling, Zhuoren; Dong, Yanjun; Qiao, Lu; Shen, Yingbo; Liu, Zhihai; Wu, Yifan; Li, Wan; Zhang, Rong; Walsh, Timothy R; Dai, Chongshan; Li, Juan; Yang, Hui; Liu, Dejun; Wang, Yang; Gao, George Fu; Shen, Jianzhong",Adv Sci (Weinh),950,10

Here, a single-step, sensitive, specific, and simple luciferase assay was developed, using the olive flounder cyp1a1 gene, for effective detection of CYP1A-inducing contaminants in coastal sediments. The developed cyp1a1-luciferase assay was highly sensitive to the widely used CYP1A inducers 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126). In the case of TCDD, significant dose-dependent increases in luciferase activity (0.3-300 ng/L) were detected. The assay was more sensitive to PCB 126 than to B[a]P. The assay also involved the highly sensitive expression of luciferase to extracted mixtures of PCBs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) collected from coastal sediments. PCBs were more capable of cyp1a1 induction in the assay system at small doses than PAHs in environmental samples. Using the cyp1a1-luciferase assay along with water or sediment chemistry will certainly aid in diagnosing CYP1A-inducing contaminants in coastal environments.","Jung, Jee-Hyun; Yim, Bora; Jeong, Sol; Yoon, Mee-Sup; Kim, Bo-Mi; Ha, Sung Yong; Kim, Moonkoo; Rhee, Jae-Sung; Lee, Young-Mi",Environ. sci. technol,950,30

DESIGN: Data of 39 208 Brazilian adults from a Behaviour Web Survey were used. Unhealthy nutrition habits were eating fruits or vegetables for <5 d/week and ultra-processed food (sugary foods, snacks, ready-to-eat frozen foods and embedded foods) for &#8805;5 d/week. For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without unhealthy behaviour before the quarantine. We created four categories of change in TV-viewing and computer/tablet use, considering a cut-off point of 4 h/d for each behaviour (1 - consistently low, 2 - become low during the quarantine, 3 - become high during the quarantine or 4 - consistently high). Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, per capita income, working status during the quarantine, skin colour and adherence to the quarantine. SETTING: Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Brazilian adults (nationally representative). RESULTS: Logistic regression models revealed that high TV-viewing and computer/tablet use incidence were associated with higher odds for elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption (TV-viewing: OR 1·70; 95 % CI 1·37, 2·12; computer/tablet: OR 1·73; 95 % CI 1·31, 2·27) and low consumption of fruit and vegetables (TV-viewing: OR 1·70; 95 % CI 1·29, 2·23; computer/tablet: OR 1·53; 95 % CI 1·08, 2·17) incidence. Consistent high computer/tablet use also presented higher odds for incidence of elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption.

Subjects and Methods: This cross-sectional study utilized an online questionnaire consisting of 29 items and three sections. The first section collected demographic information, including age, gender, location, and level of education. The second section assessed their knowledge of clinical characteristics, treatments, and disease prevention. The third section addressed the students' behaviors. Results: Respondents included 223 students, of which 37.2% were males and 62.8% were females. The largest group of respondents included medical students (44.8%), followed by dental students (41.3%). Overall, students demonstrated a thorough knowledge of disease transmission, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19. However, some of the respondents could not identify the full name of the disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (64.6%), or provide a current estimate of the number of cases diagnosed globally (49.8%). Additionally, most of the survey respondents (93.3%) reported that they had followed social distancing guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health. Conclusion: While most health students were knowledgeable about most aspects of COVID-19, others did not follow universal precautions during the outbreak, which identifies better incorporation of such information in students' academic programs.","Natto, Z S; Alshaeri, H K",Niger J Clin Pract,950,26

These lockdowns have led to temporal improvements in air quality. Here, we evaluate the changes in NO2 and O3 levels along with the associated impact upon premature mortality during the COVID-19 lockdown and deconfinement periods along the first epidemic wave across the provincial capital cities of Spain. We first quantify the change in pollutants solely due to the lockdown as the difference between business-as-usual (BAU) pollution levels, estimated with a machine learning-based meteorological normalization technique, and observed concentrations. Second, instead of using exposure-response functions between the pollutants and mortality reported in the literature, we fit conditional quasi-Poisson regression models to estimate city-specific associations between daily pollutant levels and non-accidental mortality during the period 2010-2018. Significant relative risk values are observed at lag 1 for NO2 (1.0047 [95% CI: 1.0014 to 1.0081]) and at lag 0 for O3 (1.0039 [1.0013 to 1.0065]). On average NO2 changed by -51% (intercity range -65.7 to -30.9%) and -36.4% (-53.7 to -11.6%), and O3 by -1.1% (-20.2 to 23.8%) and 0.6% (-12.4 to 23.0%), during the lockdown (57 days) and deconfinement (42 days) periods, respectively. We obtain a reduction in attributable mortality associated with NO2 changes of -119 (95% CI: -273 to -24) deaths over the lockdown, and of -53 (-114 to -10) deaths over the deconfinement. This was partially compensated by an increase in the attributable number of deaths, 14 (-72 to 99) during the lockdown, and 8 (-27 to 50) during the deconfinement, associated with the rise in O3 levels in the most populous cities during the analysed period, despite the overall small average reductions. Our study shows that the potential trade-offs between multiple air pollutants should be taken into account when evaluating the health impacts of environmental exposures.","Achebak, Hicham; Petetin, Hervé; Quijal-Zamorano, Marcos; Bowdalo, Dene; Pérez García-Pando, Carlos; Ballester, Joan",Environ Pollut,950,24

To offer additional insight, we evaluated the change in the cytokine profile in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) following a six-month treatment with pirfenidone in patients with IPF. EBC concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-15, TNF-&#945; and VEGF-A were assessed with ELISA and compared at baseline and after six months of pirfenidone treatment. Twenty-nine patients with IPF and 13 controls were evaluated at baseline. With the exception of IL-8 concentration, which was lower in patients with IPF when compared to controls (p = 0.005), the cytokine levels did not differ between the groups. Despite the use of a high sensitivity assay, IL-8 reached detectable values only in 24% of IPF patients. EBC analysis after six months of treatment with pirfenidone did not reveal any differences in the cytokine levels. The change in EBC vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) correlated with the change in the 6 min walk distance (r = 0.54, p = 0.045). We conclude that a six-month treatment with pirfenidone did not significantly change the EBC cytokine profile. Our findings support the potential usefulness of VEGF-A as a marker in IPF. The low EBC IL-8 level in patients with IPF is a novel finding which needs confirmation in larger studies.","Jaskiewicz, Kaja; Mycroft, Katarzyna; Maskey-Warzechowska, Marta; Paralusz, Karolina; Siemiez, Natalia; Nejman-Gryz, Patrycja; Barnas, Malgorzata; Krenke, Rafal; Gorska, Katarzyna",,950,29

All cases were prospectively notified, and information on peripartum care (mother-newborn separation, skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, and rooming-in) and maternal and perinatal outcomes were collected in a structured form and entered in a web-based secure system. The paper describes a cohort of 525 SARS-CoV-2 positive women who gave birth. At hospital admission, 44.8% of the cohort was asymptomatic. At delivery, 51.9% of the mothers had a birth support person in the delivery room; the average caesarean section rate of 33.7% remained stable compared to the national figure. On average, 39.0% of mothers were separated from their newborns at birth, 26.6% practised skin-to-skin, 72.1% roomed in with their babies, and 79.6% of the infants received their mother's milk. The infants separated and not separated from their SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers both had good outcomes.

However, the complex structure of siamenoside I has hindered its production in various ways. Here, a yeast cell that produces a specific ß-glucosidase for siamenoside I conversion from mogroside V was constructed, and the enzymes were coelectrospun with polyvinyl alcohol followed by phenylboronic acid crosslinking to provide potential usage in the batch production process of S I. A central composite design-response surface methodology (CCD-RSM) was used to find the optimum coelectrospinning parameters.

Our objective was to examine the association of a range of psychosocial factors with hospitalisation for COVID-19. METHODS: UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study, comprises around half a million people who were aged 40-69 years at study induction between 2006 and 2010 when information on psychosocial factors and covariates were captured. Hospitalisations for COVID-19 were ascertained between 16th March and 26th April 2020. RESULTS: There were 908 hospitalisations for COVID-19 in an analytical sample of 431,051 England-based study members. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, an elevated risk of COVID-19 was related to disadvantaged levels of education (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 2.05; 1.70, 2.47), income (2.00; 1.63, 2,47), area deprivation (2.20; 1.86, 2.59), occupation (1.39; 1.14, 1.69), psychological distress (1.58; 1.32, 1.89), mental health (1.50; 1.25, 1.79), neuroticism (1.19; 1.00, 1.42), and performance on two tests of cognitive function - verbal and numerical reasoning (2.66; 2.06, 3.34) and reaction speed (1.27; 1.08, 1.51). These associations were graded (p-value for trend &#8804; 0.038) such that effects were apparent across the full psychosocial continua. After mutual adjustment for these characteristics plus ethnicity, comorbidity, and lifestyle factors, only the relationship between lower cognitive function as measured using the reasoning test and risk of the infection remained (1.98; 1.38, 2.85). CONCLUSIONS: A range of psychosocial factors revealed associations with hospitalisation for COVID-19 of which the relation with cognitive function, a marker of health literacy, was most robust.","Batty, G D; Deary, I J; Luciano, M; Altschul, D M; Kivimäki, M; Gale, C R",Brain Behav Immun,950,16

In early 2020, Cyprus, among other European countries, was affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and adopted lockdown measures in March 2020 to limit the initial outbreak on the island. In this study, we performed a comprehensive retrospective molecular epidemiological analysis (genetic, phylogenetic, phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses) of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Cyprus from April 2020 to January 2021, covering the first ten months of the SARS-CoV-2 infection epidemic on the island. The primary aim of this study was to assess the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. Whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from 596 clinical samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) obtained from community-based diagnostic testing centers and hospitalized patients. The phylogenetic analyses revealed a total of 34 different lineages in Cyprus, with B.1.258, B.1.1.29, B.1.177, B.1.2, B.1 and B.1.1.7 (designated a Variant of Concern 202012/01, VOC) being the most prevalent lineages on the island during the study period. Phylodynamic analysis showed a highly dynamic epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with three consecutive surges characterized by specific lineages (B.1.1.29 from April to June 2020; B.1.258 from September 2020 to January 2021; and B.1.1.7 from December 2020 to January 2021). Genetic analysis of whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of the aforementioned lineages revealed the presence of mutations within the S protein (L18F, &#916;H69/V70, S898F, &#916;Y144, S162G, A222V, N439K, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, S982A and D1118H) that confer higher transmissibility and/or antibody escape (immune evasion) upon the virus. Phylogeographic analysis indicated that the majority of imports and exports were to and from the United Kingdom (UK), although many other regions/countries were identified (southeastern Asia, southern Europe, eastern Europe, Germany, Italy, Brazil, Chile, the USA, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Finland, Switzerland and Pakistan). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 infection epidemic in Cyprus is being maintained by a continuous influx of lineages from many countries, resulting in the establishment of an ever-evolving and polyphyletic virus on the island.","Chrysostomou, Andreas C; Vrancken, Bram; Koumbaris, George; Themistokleous, George; Aristokleous, Antonia; Masia, Christina; Eleftheriou, Christina; Iamp,; 959,; annou, Costakis; Stylianou, Dora C; Ioannides, Marios; Petrou, Panagiotis; Georgiou, Vasilis; Hatziyianni, Amalia; Lemey, Philippe; Vandamme, Anne-Mieke; Patsalis, Philippos P; Kostrikis, Leondios G",Viruses,950,16

MATERIALS: 2,883 well-preserved skeletal elements and 9 relatively complete skulls representing an MNI of 32 non-adults (<18 years old). METHODS: All skeletal elements were observed macroscopically and pathophysiological processes underlying any lesions or other anomalies were assessed, followed by a comparative approach to rule out potential diagnoses. RESULTS: The skeletal lesions observed were caused by inflammation due to chronic hemorrhaging, marrow hyperplasia due to an increase in hemopoiesis, rapid bone growth, and the impact of biomechanical strain on poorly mineralized elements. Rickets, scurvy, and acquired anemias best fit this pattern of lesions, although inflammation from other sources such as trauma or infection could not be definitively ruled out. CONCLUSIONS: The in utero and postnatal environments at Hisban were conducive to the development of vitamin C and D deficiencies from birth until 2 years of age. The analysis of commingled remains requires an ontological shift in the importance of the individual to the population in paleopathology. SIGNIFICANCE: This investigation demonstrates the efficacy of a combined biological and comparative approach in differential diagnosis in complicated commingled collections. In addition, it emphasizes the importance of the mother-infant dyad in understanding metabolic disease.

However, the clinical characteristics and outcomes remain unclear. In this study, 102 cases of COVID-19 from January 22, 2020 to March 26, 2020 in Xixi Hospital of Hangzhou were included. Twenty cases had pre-existing CCVD. Results showed that compared with non-CCVD patients, those with CCVD are more likely to develop severe disease (15% versus 1%), and the proportion of pneumonia severity index grade IV was significantly higher (25% versus 3.6%). Computed tomography images demonstrated that the proportion of multiple lobe lesion involvement was significantly higher in the CCVD group than in the non-CCVD group (90% versus 63.4%). Compared with non-CCVD group, the levels of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and serum amyloid-A were higher, whereas the total protein and arterial partial PaO2 were lower in the CCVD group. Although no statistical difference was observed in the outcomes between groups, CCVD patients received more intensive comprehensive treatment to improve COVID-19 symptoms compared with non-CCVD patients.

Unlike existing settings, we allow each agent to specify requirements to only accept allocations from a subset of the total supply for each resource. These requirements can take form in location constraints (e.g. A hospital can only accept volunteers who live nearby due to commute limitations). This can also model a type of substitution effect where some agents need 1 unit of resource A \emph{or} B, both belonging to the same meta-type. But some agents specifically want A, and others specifically want B. We propose a new mechanism called Dominant Resource Fairness with Meta Types which determines the allocations by solving a small number of linear programs. The proposed method satisfies Pareto optimality, envy-freeness, strategy-proofness, and a notion of sharing incentive for our setting. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study this problem formulation, which improved upon existing work by capturing more constraints that often arise in real life situations. Finally, we show numerically that our method scales better to large problems than alternative approaches.","Yin, Steven; Wang, Shatian; Zhang, Lingyi; Kroer, Christian",,950,30

BACKGROUND: Spain has been one of the countries hardest hit by the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare professionals have had to deal with traumatic and complex situations in the work context. In these particularly stressful situations, many professionals may develop CF or BO, which puts them at risk for mental health problems. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. METHODS: A total of 506 healthcare professionals (physicians and nurses) who were working in healthcare centres during the COVID-19 pandemic participated. CF, CS and BO were assessed with the Professional Quality of Life Questionnaire, and perceived stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale-14. Socio-demographic and occupational variables were also analysed. Data were collected during the period of the highest incidence of cases and highest mortality rates due to COVID-19 in Spain. This article adheres to the STROBE guidelines for the reporting of observational studies. RESULTS: Physicians had higher CF and BO scores, while nurses had higher CS scores. Perceived stress scores were similar in both occupations. Professionals working in specific COVID-19 units and in emergency departments had higher CF and BO scores, while levels of CS and perceived stress were similar regardless of the workplace. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Despite the health crisis situation and its implications for healthcare professionals, the levels of CF and BO have remained moderate/high. However, CS seems to be increasing, especially among nurses, possibly due to their motivation to relieve suffering and due to their perceived social recognition. It is necessary to implement interventions that help improve CS and prevent BO and CF among professionals in the long term.","Ruiz-Fernández, María Dolores; Ramos-Pichardo, Juan Diego; Ibáñez-Masero, Olivia; Cabrera-Troya, José; Carmona-Rega, María Inés; Ortega-Galán, Ángela María",J. clin. nurs,950,23

This study was designed to investigate UK smokers' accounts of impacts of COVID-19 on their smoking, to develop implications for supporting smoking cessation. Design. One hundred and thirty-two smokers aged 19-52 years (mean age 25 years), recruited through an advert distributed through social media and a dedicated Twitter page, completed an anonymous online questionnaire. Main Outcome Measures. Smokers produced written accounts of how COVID-19 had impacted their smoking. Responses were of unlimited length and completed online 22nd May-22nd June 2020 during UK COVID-19 lockdown. Results. Inductive thematic analysis generated three themes: i) increased smoking as a coping mechanism to deal with anxiety, boredom, stress, and anger in COVID-19 lockdown; ii) lockdown as enabling quitting through lifting social barriers and enabling a focus on health benefits; and iii) no change, avoiding Government/media COVID-19 information due to disbelief, lack of trust, and perceptions of bias. Conclusions. Results demonstrate a need for credible public health messaging on COVID-19 risk aimed at smokers. Implications for supporting smoking cessation are discussed, including maintaining quitting in those ""social smokers"" who quit during lockdown, and support on stress-management and emotion regulation in those who use smoking as a way to cope with stress, anger, and boredom.","Grogan, Sarah; Walker, Lucy; McChesney, Gillian; Gee, Ivan; Gough, Brendan; Cordero, Maria I",Psychol Health,950,16

While the UK, USA, Brazil and parts of Asia are bracing themselves for the second wave-or the extension of the first wave-it is imperative to identify the primary social, economic, environmental, demographic, ethnic, cultural and health factors contributing towards COVID-19 infection and mortality numbers to facilitate mitigation and control measures. METHODS: We process several open-access datasets on US states to create an integrated dataset of potential factors leading to the pandemic spread. We then apply several supervised machine learning approaches to reach a consensus as well as rank the key factors. We carry out regression analysis to pinpoint the key pre-lockdown factors that affect post-lockdown infection and mortality, informing future lockdown-related policy making. FINDINGS: Population density, testing numbers and airport traffic emerge as the most discriminatory factors, followed by higher age groups (above 40 and specifically 60+). Post-lockdown infected and death rates are highly influenced by their pre-lockdown counterparts, followed by population density and airport traffic. While healthcare index seems uncorrelated with mortality rate, principal component analysis on the key features show two groups: states (1) forming early epicenters and (2) experiencing strong second wave or peaking late in rate of infection and death. Finally, a small case study on New York City shows that days-to-peak for infection of neighboring boroughs correlate better with inter-zone mobility than the inter-zone distance. INTERPRETATION: States forming the early hotspots are regions with high airport or road traffic resulting in human interaction. US states with high population density and testing tend to exhibit consistently high infected and death numbers. Mortality rate seems to be driven by individual physiology, preexisting condition, age etc., rather than gender, healthcare facility or ethnic predisposition. Finally, policymaking on the timing of lockdowns should primarily consider the pre-lockdown infected numbers along with population density and airport traffic.","Roy, Satyaki; Ghosh, Preetam",PLoS One,950,24

However, after the acute phase when viral load decreases, use of Ag-RDTs might lead to high rates of false negatives, suggesting that the tests should be replaced by a combination of molecular and serological tests. When the likelihood of having COVID-19 is low, such as for asymptomatic individuals in low prevalence settings, for travel, return to schools, workplaces, and mass gatherings, Ag-RDTs with high negative predictive values can be used with confidence to rule out infection. For those who test positive in low prevalence settings, the high false positive rate means that mitigation strategies, such as molecular testing to confirm positive results, are needed. Ag-RDTs, when used appropriately, are promising tools for scaling up testing and ensuring that patient management and public health measures can be implemented without delay.","Peeling, Rosanna W; Olliaro, Piero L; Boeras, Debrah I; Fongwen, Noah","Lancet, Infect. dis.

METHODS: One hundred twenty-eight consecutive patients with T2DM (median age 70 years, 74 males) were retrospectively evaluated at the end of the lockdown period. Data on metabolic control were collected at different time: within three months before the lockdown (visit 0) and within the first six weeks after it (visit 1). RESULTS: During the lockdown, a significant increase in body weight (from 79.7 ± 18.7 kg to 81.4 ± 19.4 kg, p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI, from 29.5 ± 6 kg/m2 to 30.1 ± 6.3 kg/m2, p < 0.001), waist circumference (from 103.8 ± 13 cm to 105 ± 13.6 cm, p < 0.001), fasting plasma glucose (FPG; from 138.1 ± 29.4 mg/dL to 146.6 ± 36.4 mg/dL) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; from 7 ± 0.8 to 7.3 ± 0.9%, p < 0.001) was observed. Weight gain was directly associated with HbA1c increase (ß 0.085, C.I. 95% 0.05-0.121; p < 0.001) while insulin therapy resulted to be the only significant independent predictor of HbA1c worsening at the multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR 2.40, C.I. 1.06-5.45; p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on body weight and glucose control in T2DM patients, in particular in those on insulin treatment. This finding provides a further rationale to optimize the diabetes management during eventually new period of home confinement.","Biamonte, Emilia; Pegoraro, Francesco; Carrone, Flaminia; Facchi, Isabella; Favacchio, Giuseppe; Lania, Andrea Gerardo; Mazziotti, Gherardo; Mirani, Marco",Endocrine,950,16

Presently, a total of 1123 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University was included in this retrospective cohort study. The clinical features, complications and outcomes were compared between the suspected bacterial infection and the no evidence of bacterial infection. The risk factors of mortality and the incidence of acute organ injury were analyzed. As a result, 473 patients were selected to suspected bacterial infection (SI) group based on higher white blood cell count and procalcitonin or bacterial pneumonia on chest radiography. 650 patients were selected to the no evidence of bacterial infection (NI) group. The SI group had more severely ill patients (70.2% vs. 39.8%), more death (20.5% vs. 2.2%), and more acute organ injury (40.2% vs. 11.2%). Antibiotics were found associated with improved mortality and an increased risk for acute organ injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Intravenous moxifloxacin and meropenem increased the death rate in patients with suspected bacterial infection, while oral antibiotics reduced mortality in this group. Moreover, penicillin and meropenem treatments were associated with increased mortality of the patients with no evidence of bacterial infection. In conclusion, patients with suspected bacterial infection were more likely to have negative clinical outcomes than those without bacterial infection. Empirical use of antibiotics may not have the expected benefits.","Liu, Chengyin; Wen, Ying; Wan, Weiguo; Lei, Jingchao; Jiang, Xuejun",Int Immunopharmacol,950,1

Fortunately, changes to legislation and regulation in response to the pandemic allowed Emory Healthcare to rapidly implement telehealth care. Beginning in early March 2020 and continuing through the initial 2-month implementation period (when data collection stopped), clinicians received telehealth training and certification. Standard workflows created by means of a hub-and-spoke operational model enabled rapid sharing and deployment of best practices throughout the system's physician group practice. Lean process huddles facilitated successful implementation. In total, 2,374 healthcare professionals, including 986 attending physicians, 416 residents and fellows, and 555 advanced practice providers, were trained and certified for telehealth; 53,751 new- and established-patient audio-video telehealth visits and 10,539 established-patient telephone visits were performed in 8 weeks for a total of 64,290 virtual visits. This initiative included a new COVID-19 virtual patient clinic that saw 705 patients in a 6-week period. A total of $14,662,967 was charged during this time; collection rates were similar to in-person visits. Initial patient satisfaction scores were equivalent to in-person visits. We conclude that rapid deployment of virtual visits can be accomplished through a structured, organized approach including training, certification, and Lean principles. A hub-and-spoke model enables bidirectional feedback and timely improvements, thus facilitating swifter implementation and a quick rise in patient volume. Financial sustainability is achievable, but to sustain that, telehealth requires the support of continued deregulation by legislative and regulatory bodies.","Esper, Gregory J; Sweeney, Robert L; Winchell, Emmeline; Duffell, J Michael; Kier, Sarah C; Lukens, Hallie W; Krupinski, Elizabeth A",J Healthc Manag,950,22

This is the first study to assess risk factors of adverse mental health outcomes during lockdown in a SUD population. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study, conducted through an online survey that was completed by 303 individuals with SUD, attended in the Addiction Unit of University of Barcelona Clínic Hospital. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected and descriptive analyses were carried out. Depending on whether individuals reported a worsening or no change/improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms during lockdown, the sample was divided in two groups. A logistic regression was then carried out to identify risk factors associated with adverse mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, frequency of use for the majority of individuals with SUD remained stable during lockdown in comparison to the pre-lockdown era, although a reduction was found in frequency of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and cocaine use in a small fraction of individuals with SUD. Symptoms of clinical anxiety were found in 58.7% of the sample while 48.2% of participants scored above the clinical threshold for depression. In addition, 50.3% of the sample reported a deterioration in depression and anxiety symptoms during lockdown that was associated with the following risk factors: previous trauma-exposure, female gender, distress and isolation, income reduction and alcohol use. CONCLUSION: A high percentage of patients with SUD experienced adverse mental health outcomes during lockdown that were associated with several risk factors, which should be taken into account in policy making and prevention strategies, as well as in clinical practice, in order to provide personalized care to SUD patients during the time of the pandemic.","Blithikioti, C; Nuño, L; Paniello, B; Gual, A; Miquel, L",J Psychiatr Res,950,25

But, they can carry as well positive improvements in the human society, as waves of decision making matching rational recommendations of societal institutes. The main distinguishing features of these waves are their high amplitude, coherence (homogeneous character of social actions generated by them), and short time needed for their generation and relaxation. Such waves can be treated as large scale exhibition of the Bandwagon effect. We show that this socio-psychic phenomenon can be modeled on the basis of the recently developed {\it social laser theory}. This theory can be used to model {\it stimulated amplification of coherent social actions}.""Actions""are treated very generally, from mass protests to votes and other collective decisions, as, e.g., acceptance (often unconscious) of some societal recommendations.

In the present study, we analyzed the development of antibodies in 77 patients with an oncologic diagnosis 26 days after positive RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV2. RT-qPCR and anti-SARS-CoV2-antibody methods from BGI (MGIEasy Magnetic Beads Virus DNA/RNA Extraction Kit) and Roche (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay) were used, respectively, according to the manufacturers' specifications. Surprisingly, antibody development was detected in only 6 of 77 individuals with a confirmed history of COVID-19. Despite multiple testing, the remaining patients did not show measurable antibody concentrations in subsequent tests. These results undermine the previous hypothesis that SARS-CoV2 infections are regularly associated with antibody development and cast doubt on the provided immunity to COVID-19.

As such, policy makers need to know how to target their actions to efficiently safeguard human health and biodiversity without depriving people of ready access to food. Here, we propose a taxonomy of wet markets, oriented around the presence of live or dead animals, and whether those animals are domesticated or wild (either captive-reared or wild-caught). We assess the dimensions and levels of risk that different types of wet markets pose to people and to biodiversity. We identify six key risk factors of wet markets that can affect human health: (1) presence of high disease-risk animal taxa, (2) presence of live animals, (3) hygiene conditions, (4) market size, (5) animal density and interspecies mixing, and (6) the length and breadth of animal supply chains. We also identify key factors informing risk to biodiversity.

We perform an observational study to investigate seroprevalence and immune responses in subjects professionally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and their family members (155 individuals; ages 5-79 years). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein aligns with PCR results that confirm the previous infection. Anti-Spike IgG/IgM titers remain high 60 days post-infection and do not strongly associate with symptoms, except for fever. We analyze PBMCs from a subset of seropositive and seronegative adults. TLR7 agonist-activation reveals an increased population of IL-6+TNF-IL-1ß+ monocytes, while SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation elicits IL-33, IL-6, IFNa2, and IL-23 expression in seropositive individuals. IL-33 correlates with CD4+ T cell activation in PBMCs from convalescent subjects and is likely due to T cell-mediated effects on IL-33-producing cells. IL-33 is associated with pulmonary infection and chronic diseases like asthma and COPD, but its role in COVID-19 is unknown. Analysis of published scRNAseq data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with mild to severe COVID-19 reveals a population of IL-33-producing cells that increases with the disease. Together these findings show that IL-33 production is linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection and warrant further investigation of IL-33 in COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunity.","Stanczak, Michal A; Sanin, David E; Apostolova, Petya; Nerz, Gabriele; Lampaki, Dimitrios; Hofmann, Maike; Steinmann, Daniel; Krohn-Grimberghe, Marvin; Thimme, Robert; Mittler, Gerhard; Waller, Cornelius F; Pearce, Edward J; Pearce, Erika L",Nat Commun,950,21

Understanding the underlying mechanism and the prognostic value of this symptom will help better manage patients. SARS-CoV-2, as SARS-CoV-1, may likely spread to the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory nerve, a known gateway for respiratory neurotropic viruses. We hypothesise that sudden loss of smell due to COVID-19 is the consequence of a protective host defence mechanism involving apoptosis of olfactory receptor neurons. Sacrificing smelling over neuroprotection is a logical strategy, even more so as olfaction is the only sense with the ability to regenerate in adults. Induced apoptosis of olfactory neurons has been shown in mice, successfully preventing neuroinvasion. On the other hand, adult olfactory neurogenesis has been shown to be regulated in part by the immune system, allowing to restore olfactory function. Understanding anosmia as part of a defence mechanism would support the concept of sudden anosmia as being a positive prognostic factor in the short term. Also, it may orient research to investigate the risk of future neurodegenerative disease linked to persisting coronavirus in neurons.","Le Bon, S D; Horoi, M",Med Hypotheses,950,1

Being the first full-scale global pandemic of the digital age, COVID-19 has presented novel challenges pertinent to government advice, the spread of news and misinformation, and the trade-off between the accessibility of science and the premature public use of unproven medical interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the use of internet search terms relating to COVID-19 information and misinformation during the global pandemic, identify which were most used in six affected countries, investigate any temporal trends and the likely propagators of key search terms, and determine any correlation between the per capita cases and deaths with the adoption of these search terms in each of the six countries. METHODS: This study uses relative search volume data extracted from Google Trends for search terms linked to the COVID-19 pandemic alongside per capita case and mortality data extracted from the European Open Data Portal to identify the temporal dynamics of the spread of news and misinformation during the global pandemic in six affected countries (Australia, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). A correlation analysis was carried out to ascertain any correlation between the temporal trends of search term use and the rise of per capita mortality and disease cases. RESULTS: Of the selected search terms, most were searched immediately following promotion by governments, public figures, or viral circulation of information, but also in relation to the publication of scientific resources, which were sometimes misinterpreted before further dissemination. Strong correlations were identified between the volume of these COVID-19-related search terms (overall mean Spearman rho 0.753, SD 0.158), and per capita mortality (mean per capita deaths Spearman rho 0.690, SD 0.168) and cases (mean per capita cases Spearman rho 0.800, SD 0.112).

Recommendations for surgical emergency trauma care measures need to be adequately informed by available evidence and adapt to particular settings. To inform future recommendations, we set to summarise the effects of different personal protective equipment (PPE) on the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for trauma surgery patients. METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review using L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, that performs regular automated searches in MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and over thirty other sources. Systematic reviews of experimental and observational studies assessing the efficacy of PPE were included. Indirect evidence from other healthcare settings was also considered. Risk of bias was assessed with the AMSTAR II tool, and the GRADE approach for grading the certainty of the evidence is reported. (Registered in PROSPERO: CRD42020198267). RESULTS: Eighteen studies that fulfilled selection criteria were included. There is high certainty that the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks is associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 when compared with no mask use. In moderate to high-risk environments N95 respirators are associated with a further reduction in risk of COVID-19 infection compared with surgical masks. Eye protection also reduces the risk of contagion in this setting. Decontamination of masks and respirators with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, or dry heat is effective and does not affect PPE performance or fit. CONCLUSIONS: The use of PPE drastically reduces the risk of COVID-19 compared with no mask use in HCWs. N95 and equivalent respirators provide more protection than surgical masks. Decontamination and reuse appear feasible to overcome PPE shortages and enhance the allocation of limited resources. These effects are applicable to emergency trauma care and should inform future recommendations.

The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 706 COVID-19 patients were included (n = 349 treated with glucocorticoids, n = 357 not treated with glucocorticoids). After adjustment for relevant covariates, use of glucocorticoids was associated with a lower risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.72, p = 0.001). A significant interaction was observed between the protective effect of glucocorticoids on mortality and PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission (p = 0.042), oxygen saturation on admission (p = 0.017), and peak CRP (0.023). Such protective effect of glucocorticoids was mainly observed in patients with lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio (<300), lower oxygen saturation (<90%), and higher CRP (>100 mg/L).

Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and use predefined cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives and use this as a proxy for past infection. With the imperfect assays that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of the cumulative incidence and is usually corrected to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use an inference method-referred to as mixture-model approach-for the estimation of the cumulative incidence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that the mixture model outperforms the methods based on cutoffs, leading to less bias and error in estimates of the cumulative incidence. We illustrate how the mixture model can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test's ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the cumulative incidence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of classes of infections with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures. This is a very promising application of the mixture-model approach that could identify the elusive fraction of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. An R-package implementing the inference methods used in this paper is provided. Our study advocates using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative radiotherapy plus surgery versus surgery alone on abdominal recurrence-free survival. METHODS: EORTC-62092 is an open-label, randomised, phase 3 study done in 31 research institutions, hospitals, and cancer centres in 13 countries in Europe and North America. Adults (aged &#8805;18 years) with histologically documented, localised, primary retroperitoneal sarcoma that was operable and suitable for radiotherapy, who had not been previously treated and had a WHO performance status and American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 2 or lower, were centrally randomly assigned (1:1), using an interactive web response system and a minimisation algorithm, to receive either surgery alone or preoperative radiotherapy followed by surgery. Randomisation was stratified by hospital and performance status. Radiotherapy was delivered as 50·4 Gy (in 28 daily fractions of 1·8 Gy) in either 3D conformal radiotherapy or intensity modulated radiotherapy, and the objective of surgery was a macroscopically complete resection of the tumour mass with en-bloc organ resection as necessary. The primary endpoint was abdominal recurrence-free survival, as assessed by the investigator, and was analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in all patients who started their allocated treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01344018. FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2012 and April 10, 2017, 266 patients were enrolled, of whom 133 were randomly assigned to each group. The median follow-up was 43·1 months (IQR 28·8-59·2). 128 (96%) patients from the surgery alone group had surgery, and 119 (89%) patients in the radiotherapy and surgery group had both radiotherapy and surgery. Median abdominal recurrence-free survival was 4·5 years (95% CI 3·9 to not estimable) in the radiotherapy plus surgery group and 5·0 years (3·4 to not estimable) in the surgery only group (hazard ratio 1·01, 95% CI 0·71-1·44; log rank p=0·95). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were lymphopenia (98 [77%] of 127 patients in the radiotherapy plus surgery group vs one [1%] of 128 patients in the surgery alone group), anaemia (15 [12%] vs ten [8%]), and hypoalbuminaemia (15 [12%] vs five [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 30 (24%) of 127 patients in the radiotherapy plus surgery group, and in 13 (10%) of 128 patients in the surgery alone group. One (1%) of 127 patients in the radiotherapy plus surgery group died due to treatment-related serious adverse events (gastropleural fistula), and no patients in the surgery alone group died due to treatment-related serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Preoperative radiotherapy should not be considered as standard of care treatment for retroperitoneal sarcoma.

DESIGN: A survey consisting of closed-set and open-ended questions that assessed working practices during the COVID-19 restrictions and audiologists' attitudes towards teleaudiology. SAMPLE: About 120 audiologists in the UK recruited via snowball sampling through social media and emails. RESULTS: About 30% of respondents said they had used teleaudiology prior to COVID-19 restrictions; 98% had done at the time of survey completion, and 86% said they would continue to do so even when restrictions are lifted. Reasons for prior non-use of teleaudiology were associated with clinical limitations/needs, available infrastructure and patient preferences. Respondents believe teleaudiology will improve travel, convenience, flexibility and scheduling, that it will have little/no impact on satisfaction and quality of care, but that it will negatively impact personal interactions. Concerns about teleaudiology focussed on communication, inability to conduct some clinical procedures and technology. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents' experience with teleaudiology has generally been positive however improvements to infrastructure and training are necessary, and because many procedures must be conducted in-person, it will always be necessary to have hybrid-care pathways available.","Saunders, Gabrielle H; Roughley, Amber",Int J Audiol,950,30

They also reported increased caution toward other people and objects that other people interacted with due to their fear of COVID-19 infection. They expressed fear about COVID-19 infection and anxiety about COVID-19-related news, and they often felt bored and depressed; however, the participants accepted, endured, and gradually adapted to these lifestyle changes.

How should we think about offering payment to participants in these trials? Payment for research participation is ethically contentious even under ideal circumstances, and pandemics are far from ideal. Here, we review the three functions of research payment-reimbursement, compensation, and incentive-and identify heightened and novel ethical concerns in the context of a global pandemic. We argue that COVID-19 trial participants should usually be offered reimbursement for research-related expenses, as well as compensation for their time and effort, as is true for other types of research under usual circumstances. Given increased risk of undue influence against pandemic background conditions, incentive payment should be avoided unless essential to recruitment and retention in important trials whose social value outweighs this risk. Where essential, however, incentives can be ethically permissible, so long as reasonable efforts are made to minimize the possibility of undue influence.","Largent, Emily A; Lynch, Holly Fernandez",J. infect. dis,950,25

We investigated the analytical and clinical performances of a SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG assay, automated on a high throughput platform, and the correlation of the antibodies (Ab) levels with the plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT50) Ab titers. METHODS: A series of 546 samples were evaluated by SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG assay (Snibe diagnostics), including 171 negative and 168 positive SARS-CoV-2 subjects and a further group of 207 subjects of the COVID-19 family clusters follow-up cohort. RESULTS: Assay imprecision ranged from 3.98 to 12.18% being satisfactory at low and medium levels; linearity was excellent in all the measurement range. Considering specimens collected after 14 days post symptoms onset, overall sensitivity and specificity were 99.0 and 92.5%, respectively. A total of 281 leftover samples results of the PRNT50 test were available.

METHODS: A 29-question anonymous online survey was sent by e-mail to members of the Italian Association of Medical Oncology and the Italian Breast Cancer Study Group on April 3, 2020. Only medical oncologists (both those in training and specialists) were invited to complete the questionnaire. RESULTS: Out of 165 responding oncologists, 121 (73.3.%) worked in breast units. In the (neo)adjuvant setting, compared with before the emergency, fewer oncologists adopted weekly paclitaxel (68.5% v 93.9%) and a dose-dense schedule for anthracycline-based chemotherapy (43% v 58.8%) during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the metastatic setting, compared with before the emergency, fewer oncologists adopted first-line weekly paclitaxel for HER2-positive disease (41.8% v 53.9%) or CDK4/6 inhibitors for luminal tumors with less-aggressive characteristics (55.8% v 80.0%) during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Recent evidence suggests that opioid epidemics are getting worse with the COVID-19 crisis. The increase in opioid abuse could be attributed to the extended lockdowns and the social distancing recommendations, hindering chronic pain patients' access to regular office visits and monitoring in addition to limited access to behavioral services like group therapies and other pain management interventions. Use of telemedicine as an alternative to in-person follow-up visits has faced many limitations due to technological challenges and cost. Chronic pain patients living in developing countries face extra burden during the pandemic. Limited access to outpatient clinics and hesitance to visit hospitals due to COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to reduction in supply of opioids, are some of the limiting factors. Unfortunately, the low-income class with limited financial capabilities faces further barriers to access the chronic pain services and treatments like opioid prescriptions. Medical entities involved in care of chronic pain patients have adopted different strategies to overcome these challenges. In addition to expanding on educational programs to medical staff and patients, modifying the strict opioid pre-scribing and dispensing regulations has been successful. Another positive trend has been the growing use of opioid sparing interventions, such as multimodal analgesia, regional blocks, and interventional pain procedures.","Ayad, Amany E",J Opioid Manag,950,30

The objective of this study was to estimate the disease burden associated with influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United Kingdom stratified by age, risk and influenza vaccination status. METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional, exploratory, observational study used linked data from the General Practice Research Database and the Hospital Episode Statistics databases to estimate resource use and cost associated with ILI in the UK. RESULTS: Data were included from 156,193 patients with ≥1 general practitioner visit with ILI. There were 21,518 high-risk patients, of whom 12,514 (58.2%) were vaccinated and 9,004 (41.8%) were not vaccinated, and 134,675 low-risk patients, of whom 17,482 (13.0%) were vaccinated and 117,193 (87.0%) were not vaccinated. High-risk vaccinated patients were older (p<0.001) and had more risk conditions (p<0.001). High-risk (odds ratio [OR] 2.16) or vaccinated (OR 1.19) patients had a higher probability of >1 general practitioner visit compared with low-risk and unvaccinated patients. Patients who were high-risk and vaccinated had a reduced risk of >1 general practitioner visit (OR 0.82; p<0.001). High-risk individuals who were also vaccinated had a lower probability of ILI-related hospitalisation than individuals who were high-risk or vaccinated alone (OR 0.59). In people aged ≥65 years, the mortality rate was lower in vaccinated than unvaccinated individuals (OR 0.75). The cost of ILI-related GP visits and hospital admissions in the UK over the study period in low-risk vaccinated patients was £27,391,142 and £141,932,471, respectively. In low-risk unvaccinated patients the corresponding values were £168,318,709 and £112,534,130, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although vaccination rates in target groups have increased, many people are still not receiving influenza vaccination, and the burden of ILI in the United Kingdom remains substantial. Improving influenza vaccination uptake may have the potential to reduce this burden.","Pockett, Rhys D.; Watkins, John; McEwan, Phil; Meier, Genevieve",PLoS One,950,1

Specifically, construction needs to be constantly aware of safety and risk balanced with timely project delivery. Guidance for COVID‐19 must therefore be implemented in a way that reflects working practice and pressures. There is, however, a potential knowledge gap regarding the practical feasibility and impact of applying COVID‐19 measures within construction, made more difficult by factors such as the temporary nature of projects and complex working arrangements. This article presents a commentary on safe construction during, and beyond, COVID‐19, covering the human factors challenges and practicalities of implementing COVID‐19 measures. We observe that while guidance is strong on risk management, understanding of how best to implement this guidance is not yet stable. Also, care must be taken that implementing guidance does not detract from general safety, which is also challenged by increased pressures on delivery arising from COVID‐19. There may, however, be opportunities for safer working practice arising from new awareness of health, hygiene, and safety risk. The role of safety leadership is overlooked in guidance yet is vital to ensure safe application of COVID‐19 working practices. The key message is that COVID‐19 needs to be integrated and promoted within a general risk management approach, in part because this takes account of differing priorities regarding safety risks, rather than overly focussing on COVID‐19, and also because the effectiveness of COVID‐19 mitigations can be amplified by integration with pre‐existing safety processes.","Stiles, Shelly; Golightly, David; Ryan, Brendan",Hum Factors Ergon Manuf,950,29

All patients have a right to these services. Contraception and abortion care remain essential, and we need to work at the local, state and federal level on policies that preserve these critical services. We must also support policies that will promote expansion of care, including lengthening Medicaid pregnancy/postpartum coverage.

Relationship between interleukins and depression is still subject matter of the research, but a correlation between interleukin-6 and depressive disorders is proven by now. The aim of this study is to verify differences among interleukin-6 blood levels of inpatients treated with SSRI and/or SNRI before and during hospitalization and of inpatients not treated with these drugs. METHODS: This is an observational study performed during the first wave of SARS Cov-2 pandemic in Italy for three months. The hospitalized patients of Internal Medicine wards and Infectious and Tropical Diseases ward of Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi of Florence for COVID-19 pneumonia have been divided into two subgroups (treated / not treated with antidepressants). Patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit previously have been excluded. Each patient has been evaluated concerning demographic, clinical and therapeutic features. The first dosage of interleukin-6 detected during hospitalization has been noticed. RESULTS: 8,5% (n=34 patients) of the entire sample (n=402) had been treated with an antidepressant of the two considered categories before admission until discharge from hospital. Significant lower levels of interleukin-6 of recovered patients of the treated subgroup have been highlighted as compared to recovered patients of not-treated subgroup (12,1 vs 25,4 p<0,001). These results have been pointed out in spite of higher mean age and more serious comorbidities of the treated subgroup. Nevertheless the incidence of severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is significantly lower in the subgroup of patients with antidepressant treatment (20,6% vs 43,2% p<0,02) as well as endotracheal intubation employment (0,0% vs 11,7% p<0,04). The rate of deceased patients of treated-subgroup is not significant lower than the rate of not-treated subgroup (23,5% vs 26,4% p=0,13). CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19 pneumonia, the production of interleukin-6 seems to be modulated in presence of antidepressant therapy. Further proofs and broader surveys are necessary.","Fei, Leonardo; Santarelli, Gabriele; D039,; Anna, Giulio; Moretti, Sandra; Mirossi, Giulia; Patti, Andrea; Sanfilippo, Giulia; Almerigogna, Fabio; Berni, Andrea; Caldini, Eleonora; Lagi, Filippo; Para, Ombretta; Vaudo, Micol; Vultaggio, Alessandra",Panminerva med,950,28

The aim of our study was to examine outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients among blood groups A and O. METHODS: This is an observational study. Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-square tests were used to compare continuous and categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine association of blood groups with rates of mortality and severity of disease. All adult patients (> 18 years) admitted with COVID-19 infection between March 1, 2020 and March 10, 2021 at a large community hospital in Northeast Georgia were included. We compared mortality, severity of disease (use of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor, and acute renal failure), rates of venous thromboembolism and inflammatory markers between the blood groups. We used multivariable logistic regression model to adjust for demographical and clinical characteristics, use of COVID-19 medications and severity. RESULTS: A total of 3,563 of 5,204 admitted patients had information on blood groups. Of these, 1,301 (36.5%) were group A, 377 (10.6 %) were group B, 133 (3.7%) were group AB and 1,752 (49.2%) were group O. On adjusted analysis, there were no significant differences in rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, acute renal failure, venous thromboembolism and readmission rate between the blood groups A and O. In-hospital mortality was also not statistically different among the blood groups A and O (17.5% vs. 20.1%; P = 0.07). On adjusted analysis, in-hospital mortality was not lower in blood groups O (odds ratio (OR): 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80 - 1.40, P = 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Once hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, blood groups A and O are not associated with increased severity or in-hospital mortality.","Kumar, Gagan; Nanchal, Rahul; Hererra, Martin; Sakhuja, Ankit; Patel, Dhaval; Meersman, Mark; Dalton, Drew; Guddati, Achuta Kumar",J Hematol,950,22

Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. Methods Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (>13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ + azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ + amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of ≥2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. Results Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29–2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80–4.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80–7.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. Conclusions HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data. However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution.","Sarayani, Amir; Cicali, Brian; Henriksen, Carl H.; Brown, Joshua D.",Res Social Adm Pharm,950,3

Because the residents were a population naïve to COVID-19 and many of them had only one chance of exposure, careful epidemiological investigation could reveal attack rates among close contacts on the specific date of exposure. We identified 89 cases and 328 close contacts. Among the close contacts, 114 had only one chance of exposure to their 20 index cases. During the follow-up period, 17 of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Overall attack rate 15%) after the exposure to 6 infectors. The median number of close contacts was 5.5 (range 2-14) for the 6 infectors. Attack rates among those close contacts were 13% (1/8), 20% (2/5), 33% (2/6), 50% (1/2), 64% (4/9 and 5/5) and 100% (2/2). Transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 seems to peak one day before symptom onset, and it was at similar level two days before (16%) and on the day (20%) of symptom onset. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to control the COVID-19 outbreak in addition to investigation which started after the case identification.","Kitahara, Mizue; Yamagishi, Takuya; Tsukada, Shota; Sudo, Yasuhiro; Yoshida, Tetsuya; Sunagawa, Tomimasa; Suzuki, Motoi",Jpn. j. infect. dis,950,20

Embelin, a quinone natural product, is known to have antiviral activity against influenza and hepatitis B. Preliminary studies by our group also indicate its ability to inhibit HSV-1 in cultured cells. METHODS: Docking and DFT methods applied to the protease target. RESULTS: a mechanism for this inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease is described, specifically due to formation of a covalent bond between S(Cys145) and an embelin C(carbonyl). This is assisted by two protein amino acids (1) N(imidazole-His41) which is able to capture H[S(Cys145)] and (2) HN(Met165), which donates a proton to embelin O(carbonyl) forming an OH moiety that results in inhibition of the viral protease. A similar process is also seen with the anti-inflammatory drugs methyl prednisolone and dexamethasone, used for Covid-19 patients. Methyl prednisolone and dexamethasone are methide quinones, and possess only one carbonyl moiety, instead of two for embelin. Additional consideration was given to another natural product, emodin, recently patented against Covid-19, as well as some therapeutic quinones, vitamin K, suspected to be involved in Covid-19 action, and coenzyme Q10. All show structural similarities with embelin, dexamethasone and methyl prednisolone results. CONCLUSIONS: Our data on embelin and related quinones indicate that these natural compounds may represent a feasible, strategic tool against Covid-19.","Caruso, Francesco; Rossi, Miriam; Pedersen, Jens Z.; Incerpi, Sandra",J Infect Public Health,950,28

Adolescents consume substantially more free sugar than is recommended. National (UK) School Food Standards (SFS) are in place but are not mandatory in all schools, and their impact on the diets of secondary school pupils is unknown. We aim to evaluate how SFS and wider healthy eating recommendations (from the national School Food Plan (SFP)) are implemented in secondary schools and how they influence pupils’ diets and dental health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Secondary-level academies/free schools in the West Midlands, UK were divided into two groups: SFS mandated and SFS non-mandated. Using propensity scores to guide sampling, we aim to recruit 22 schools in each group. We will compare data on school food provision and sales, school food culture and environment, and the food curriculum from each group, collected through: school staff, governor, pupil, parent surveys; school documents; and observation. We will explore the implementation level for the SFS requirements and SFP recommendations and develop a school food typology. We aim to recruit 1980 pupils aged 11–15 years across the 44 schools and collect dietary intake (24-hour recall) and dental health data through self-completion surveys. We will compare free sugar/other dietary intake and dental health across the two SFS groups and across the identified school types. School type will be further characterised in 4–8 case study schools through school staff interviews and pupil focus groups. Evaluation of economic impact will be through a cost-consequence analysis and an exploratory cost–utility analysis.

This screening is often done by computationally docking ligands into a protein binding site of interest, but this has the drawback of a large number of poses that must be evaluated to obtain accurate estimates of protein-ligand binding affinity. We here introduce a fast pre-filtering method for ligand prioritization that is based on a set of machine learning models and uses simple pose-invariant physicochemical descriptors of the ligands and the protein binding pocket. Our method, Rapid Screening with Physicochemical Descriptors + machine learning (RASPD+), is trained on PDBbind data and achieves a regression performance that is better than that of the original RASPD method and traditional scoring functions on a range of different test sets without the need for generating ligand poses. Additionally, we use RASPD+ to identify molecular features important for binding affinity and assess the ability of RASPD+ to enrich active molecules from decoys.","Holderbach, Stefan; Adam, Lukas; Jayaram, B.; Wade, Rebecca C.; Mukherjee, Goutam",Front Mol Biosci,950,28

The benefits of intermodal freight transportation have been studied and are more observable in commercial logistics; however, the potential benefits of humanitarian logistics have not been thoroughly investigated. This research aims to present a resilient transportation framework by modeling intermodal transportation utilizing interoperable loading devices during disaster responses. We developed an integer programming model based on a time–space network by considering route and vehicle availabilities that are allowed to change with time. We consider vehicles with varying capacities in three transportation modes (i.e., ground, maritime, and air). The contribution of this study is threefold: (1) Two compatible unit load devices are proposed for humanitarian logistics; (2) a mathematical model that includes integer variable representation for vehicle fleets in different transportation modes is developed; and (3) intermodal transportation is compared with single-mode transportation using a real-life dataset. Our main results are as follows: In terms of cost, intermodal transportation is effective when demand occurs in consecutive periods and response time is short. Inventory is held more in intermodal transportation when it is cost-effective to use transportation modes with large capacities. Thus, the benefits of the responsiveness of intermodal transportation outweigh the costs of mode interchange and inventory holding for sudden-onset disasters where quick responses are needed within a short time.","Kavlak, Hasan; Ertem, Mustafa Alp; Satır, Benhür",Arab J Sci Eng,950,1

Monitoring athletes with the use of wearable technology could provide a way to potentially manage training and competition loads and reduce injuries. One such technology is the VERT inertial measurement unit, a commercially available discrete wearable device containing a 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis magnetometer. Some of the main measurement outputs include jump count, jump height and landing impacts. While several studies have examined the accuracy of the VERT’s measures of jump height and jump count, landing impact force has not yet been investigated. The objective of this research study was to explore the validity of the VERT landing impact values. We hypothesized that the absolute peak VERT acceleration values during a jump-land cycle would fall within 10% of the peak acceleration values derived simultaneously from a research-grade accelerometer (Shimmer). Fourteen elite university-level volleyball players each performed 10 jumps while wearing both devices simultaneously. The results showed that VERT peak accelerations were variable (limits of agreement of -84.13% and 52.37%) and had a propensity to be lower (mean bias of -15.88%) when compared to the Shimmer. In conclusion, the validity of the VERT device’s landing impact values are generally poor, when compared to the Shimmer.","Damji, Faraz; MacDonald, Kerry; Hunt, Michael A.; Taunton, Jack; Scott, Alex",PLoS One,950,22

Objective: We sought to investigate the impact of mitigation measures during the spring wave of COVID-19 on the incidence of other laboratory-confirmed respiratory viruses in Hamilton, Ontario. Methods: All nasopharyngeal swab specimens (n = 57,503) submitted for routine respiratory virus testing at a regional laboratory serving all acute-care hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario between January 2010 and June 2020 were reviewed. Testing for influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza I-III, adenovirus and rhinovirus/enterovirus was done routinely using a laboratory-developed polymerase chain reaction multiplex respiratory viral panel.

Effective prioritization of these measures can be determined by understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of three parameters: (i) secondary attack rate (SAR) in various settings, (ii) clinical onset serial interval (SI), and (iii) the proportion of asymptomatic infection. Methods and Findings We searched PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv databases between January 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, for articles describing SARS-CoV-2 attack rate, SI, and asymptomatic infection. Studies were included if they presented original data for estimating point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the three parameters. Random effects models were constructed to pool SAR, mean SI, and asymptomatic proportion. Risk ratios were used to examine differences in transmission risk by setting, type of contact, and symptom status of the index case. Publication and related bias were assessed by funnel plots and Egger's meta-regression test for small-study effects. Our search strategy for SAR, SI, and asymptomatic infection identified 459, 572, and 1624 studies respectively. Of these, 20 studies met the inclusion criteria for SAR, 18 studies for SI, and 66 studies for asymptomatic infection. We estimated the pooled household SAR at 15.4% (95% CI: 12.2%, 18.7%) compared to 4.0% (95% CI: 2.8%, 5.2%) in non-household settings. We observed variation across settings; however, the small number of studies limited power to detect associations and sources of heterogeneity. SAR of symptomatic index cases is significantly higher than cases that were symptom-free at diagnosis (RR 2.55, 95% CI: 1.47, 4.45). Adults appear to be more susceptible to transmission than children (RR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.96). The pooled mean SI is estimated at 4.87 days (95% CI: 3.98, 5.77). The pooled proportion of cases who had no symptoms at diagnosis is 25.9% (95% CI: 18.8%, 33.1%). Conclusions Based our pooled estimates, 10 infected symptomatic persons living with 100 contacts would result in 15 additional cases in <5 days. To be effective, quarantine of contacts should occur within 3 days of symptom onset. If testing and tracing relies on symptoms, one-quarter of cases would be missed. As such, while aggressive contact tracing strategies may be appropriate early in an outbreak, as it progresses, control measures should transition to account for SAR variability across settings. Targeted strategies focusing on high-density enclosed settings may be effective without overly restricting social movement.","Koh, W. C.; Naing, L.; Rosledzana, M. A.; Alikhan, M.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the onset of hand eczema during the COVID‐19 pandemic in health care workers (HCWs) directly involved in intensive care of COVID‐19 patients and HCWs without direct contact. Hereby, we aim at increasing awareness with regard to occupational hand eczema and preventive measures that can be undertaken. METHODS: A survey was distributed amongst 114 HCWs at a single surgical site and at a COVID‐19 intensive care unit of the university hospital LMU Munich, Germany. Participants were questioned with regard to the daily frequency of hand hygiene prior to and during the pandemic. Participants self‐reported onset of hand eczema and associated symptoms. RESULTS: Our study revealed a significant increase of hand washing, disinfection and use of hand cream across all participants (P‐value<.001), regardless of having direct contact with COVID‐19 patients. A high prevalence of symptoms associated with acute hand dermatitis was found in 90.4% across all HCWs, whereas hand eczema itself was underreported (14.9%). CONCLUSION: The increase of hand sanitation during the COVID‐19 pandemic impairs the skin of the hands across all HCWs, independent of direct intensive care of affected patients.

In this paper, we propose a model to predict whether a patient infected with COVID-19 will develop severe outcomes based only on the patient’s historical electronic health records (EHR) prior to hospital admission using recurrent neural networks. The model predicts risk score that represents the probability for a patient to progress into severe status (mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, or death) after being infected with COVID-19. The model achieved 0.846 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in predicting patients’ outcomes averaged over 5-fold cross validation. While many of the existing models use features obtained after diagnosis of COVID-19, our proposed model only utilizes a patient’s historical EHR to enable proactive risk management at the time of hospital admission.","Lee, Junghwan; Ta, Casey; Kim, Jae Hyun; Liu, Cong; Weng, Chunhua",medRxiv,950,1

According to previous studies, the circumstances of coronavirus disease-related deaths may lead to dysfunctional grief. The purpose of this study was to introduce the Polish adaptation of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS) as well as to assess the relationship between dysfunctional grief due to a COVID-19 death, resilience and perceived social support. The adaptation was carried out on a general population sample of 286 individuals aged 18–54 years, with the evaluation being performed on a group comprising 214 people aged 18–78 years, who lost a loved one during the pandemic. The Polish version of PGS revealed a single-factor structure with strong internal consistency (α = 0.89). The PGS scores were associated with measures of complicated grief (Inventory of Complicated Grief), depression (Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale) and lower resilience (Resilience Scale 14), which confirmed the scale’s convergent validity. No relation between PGS scores and health behaviors (Inventory of Health Behaviors) was observed, which confirmed the scale’s discriminant validity. The results of the bootstrapping technique revealed that resilience mediates the relationship between perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support) and dysfunctional grief (total mediation). The results of this study suggest the need for practitioners to focus on resilience-enhancing interventions and perceived social support in order to improve mental health in people who lost their loved ones during the new coronavirus pandemic.","Skalski, Sebastian; Konaszewski, Karol; Dobrakowski, Paweł; Surzykiewicz, Janusz; Lee, Sherman A.",Curr Psychol,950,26

The aim of this study was to formalize indicators for measuring the fulfillment of assumptions for appropriate proximity tracing app functioning. Six indicators were developed to monitor the SwissCovid app functioning and effectiveness in the Swiss population. Using official statistics and survey data, we calculated indicator values and examined socio-demographic factors associated with the SwissCovid app utilization. Indicators show that 1 in 3 adults in Switzerland have downloaded the app. However, only 15% of new cases also triggered DPT-app notifications, and indicators also reveal ignored app notifications. In the full survey sample (n=2098), higher monthly household income or being a non-smoker were associated with higher SwissCovid app uptake; older age or having a non-Swiss nationality with a lower uptake. In a subsample including more detailed information (n=701), high trust in health authorities was associated with higher SwissCovid app uptake. The indicators help to monitor key drivers of DPT-apps effectiveness and hint to non-compliance issues. Streamlining procedures, removing technical hurdles, and communicating the usefulness of DPT-apps are crucial to promote uptake, compliance, and ultimately effectiveness of DPT-apps for pandemic mitigation.","von Wyl, V.; Hoeglinger, M.; Sieber, C.; Kaufmann, M.; Moser, A.; Serra-Burriel, M.; Ballouz, T.; Menges, D.; Frei, A.; Puhan, M.",,950,16

Design: A prospective, single-center observational study was carried out. Setting: Intensive care. Patients: Patients admitted due to COVID-19 and respiratory failure. Interventions: None. Variables: Automatic recording was made of demographic variables, severity parameters, laboratory data, assisted ventilation (HFO: high-flow oxygen therapy and IMV: invasive mechanical ventilation), oxygenation (PaO2, PaO2/FiO2) and complications. The patients were divided into three groups: survivors (G1), deceased (G2) and patients remaining under admission (G3). The chi-squared test or Fisher exact test (categorical variables) was used, along with the Mann-Whitney U-test or Wilcoxon test for analyzing the differences between medians. Statistical significance was considered for p<0.05. Results: A total of 43 patients were included (G1=28 [65.1%], G2=10 [23.3%] and G3=5[11.6%]), with a mean age of 65 years (range 52-72), 62% males, APACHE II 18 (15-24), SOFA 6 (4-7). Arterial hypertension (30.2%) and obesity (25.6%) were the most frequent comorbidities. High-flow oxygen therapy was used in 62.7% of the patients, with failure in 85%. In turn, 95% of the patients required IMV and 85% received ventilation in prone decubitus. In the general population, initial PaO2/FiO2 improved after 7 days (165 [125-210] vs.194 [153-285]; p=0.02), in the same way as in G1 (164 [125-197] vs. 207 [160-294]; p=0.07), but not in G2 (163 [95-197] vs. 135 [85-177]). No bacterial coinfection was observed. The incidence of IMV-associated pneumonia was high (13 episodes/1000 days of IMV). Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 require early IMV, a high frequency of ventilation in prone decubitus, and have a high incidence of failed HFO. The lack of improvement of PaO2/FiO2 at 7 days could be a prognostic marker.

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hand hygiene performance (HHP) rates in acute care hospitals. METHODS: HHP rates were estimated using an automated hand hygiene monitoring system (AHHMS) installed in 74 adult inpatient units in 7 hospitals and 10 pediatric inpatient units in 2 children's hospitals. A segmented regression model was used to estimate the trajectory of HHP rates in the ten weeks leading up to a COVID-19-related milestone event (eg, school closures) and for ten weeks after. RESULTS: Three effects emerged, all of which were significant at p < .01. Average HHP rates increased from 46% to 56% in the months preceding pandemic-related school closures. This was followed by a 6% upward shift at the time school closures occurred. HHP rates remained over 60% for four weeks before declining to 54% at the end of the study period. CONCLUSION: Data from an AHHMS indicated that HHP shifted in multiple directions during the early stages of the pandemic.

However, overexposure to disinfecting chemicals may lead to unintended human health risks. Here, using an indoor fate and chemical exposure model, we estimate human exposure to 22 disinfecting chemicals on the lists recommended by various governmental agencies against COVID-19, resulting from contact with disinfected surfaces and handwashing. Three near-field exposure routes, i.e., mouthing-mediated oral ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption, are considered to calculate the whole-body uptake doses and blood concentrations caused by single use per day for three age groups (3, 14, and 24-year-old). We also assess the health risks by comparing the predicted whole-body uptake doses with in vivo toxicological data and the predicted blood concentrations with in vitro bioactivity data. Our results indicate that both the total exposure and relative contribution from each exposure route vary considerably among the disinfecting chemicals due to their diverse physicochemical properties. 3-year-old children have consistent higher exposure than other age groups, especially in the scenario of contact with disinfected surfaces, due to their more frequent hand contact and mouthing activities. Due to the short duration of handwashing, we do not expect any health risk from the use of disinfecting chemicals in handwashing. In contrast, exposure from contact with disinfected surfaces may result in health risks for certain age groups especially children, even the surfaces are disinfected once a day. Interestingly, risk assessments based on whole-body uptake doses and in vivo toxicological data tend to give higher risk estimates than do those based on blood concentrations and in vitro bioactivity data. Our results reveal the most important exposure routes for disinfecting chemicals used in the indoor environment; they also highlight the need for more accurate data for both chemical properties and toxicity to better understand the risks associated with the increased use of disinfecting chemicals in the pandemic.","Li, Dingsheng; Sangion, Alessandro; Li, Li",Environ Int,950,22

Studies have shown that smokers are less likely to be diagnosed with or be hospitalized for COVID-19 but, once hospitalized, have higher odds for an adverse outcome. We have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a ""toxin-like"" epitope on the Spike glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. This epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human anti-SARS-CoV antibody CR3022.

La evaluación de un niño febril al regreso de un viaje es clínica: verificación de los antecedentes y las vacunaciones, búsqueda de otros casos en contacto, signos funcionales y físicos, y características del viaje. Unas pruebas complementarias de rutina completan a menudo la evaluación para una orientación sindrómica. Si bien las causas de fiebre son, sobre todo, cosmopolitas, la gravedad de la enfermedad exótica obliga a buscarlas prioritariamente. El paludismo debe sospecharse ante una fiebre procedente de África subsahariana. El diagnóstico se basa en la asociación de un frotis sanguíneo y una prueba sensible (gota gruesa, reacción en cadena de la polimerasa [PCR]) o una prueba de diagnóstico rápido (para Plasmodium falciparum). Los criterios clínico-biológicos de gravedad son esenciales para orientar y tratar al paciente. En caso de acceso no complicado por P. falciparum, el tratamiento se basa en un tratamiento combinado a base de artemisinina (ACT), arteméter-lumefantrina o artenimol-piperaquina. Los accesos graves se tratan con artesunato intravenoso, seguido de ACT oral. Dengue, chikungunya e infección por virus Zika tienen características clínicas comunes (fiebre-erupción-artralgias, tratamiento sintomático). En caso de dengue, conviene controlar la aparición de signos de alerta, que podrían hacer temer una evolución negativa. El chikungunya es grave en caso de transmisión en el parto, con un riesgo de encefalitis neonatal. En el niño, el Zika es asintomático o poco sintomático. Pero, en caso de infección durante el embarazo, el riesgo es el de una embriofetopatía. El diagnóstico de estas arbovirosis se basa en la PCR en la fase aguda y en la serología secundariamente. La sintomatología de la fiebre tifoidea es poco específica, lo cual justifica la práctica de hemocultivos sistemáticos ante una fiebre tras un viaje. Su tratamiento se basa en las cefalosporinas de tercera generación o el ciprofloxacino, pero las resistencias aumentan. En suma, la diversidad de las etiologías de una fiebre al regreso de un viaje y la potencial gravedad de las infecciones importadas imponen una reflexión sobre el proceso de tratamiento de estos pacientes, en especial en lo referente al riesgo de fiebre hemorrágica.","Minodier, P.; Imbert, P.",EMC - Pediatría,950,1

We have examined the biochemical properties of PRRSV 3CLpro and identified those amino acid residues involved in its catalytic activity as a prelude to developing anti-PRRSV strategies. The 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. The optimal temperature and pH for its proteolytic activity were 8°C and 7.5, respectively. Na(+) (1000 mM) and K(+) (500 mM) were not inhibitory to its activity but Cu(2+), Zn(2+), PMSF and EDTA were significantly inhibitory. His(39), Asp(64) and Ser(118) residues were identified to form the catalytic triad of PRRSV 3CLpro by a series of site-directed mutagenesis analysis.
