1441,"Treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome with allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells: a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study",2014-04-04,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) modulate the immune response and reduce lung injury in animal models. Currently, no clinical studies of the effects of MSCs in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) exist. The objectives of this study were first to examine the possible adverse events after systemic administration of allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs in ARDS patients and second to determine potential efficacy of MSCs on ARDS. METHODS: Twelve adult patients meeting the Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio of < 200 were randomized to receive allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs or placebo in a 1:1 fashion. Patients received one intravenous dose of 1 × 10(6) cells/kg of body weight or saline. Possible side effects were monitored after treatment. Acute lung injury biomarkers, including IL-6, IL-8 and surfactant protein D (SP-D), were examined to determine the effects of MSCs on lung injury and inflammation. RESULTS: There were no infusion toxicities or serious adverse events related to MSCs administration and there were no significant differences in the overall number of adverse events between the two groups. Length of hospital stay, ventilator-free days and ICU-free days at day 28 after treatment were similar. There were no changes in biomarkers examined in the placebo group. In the MSCs group, serum SP-D levels at day 5 were significantly lower than those at day 0 (p = 0.027) while the changes in IL-8 levels were not significant. The IL-6 levels at day 5 showed a trend towards lower levels as compared with day 0, but this trend was not statistically significant (p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs appears to be safe and feasible in the treatment of ARDS. However, the clinical effect with the doses of MSCs used is weak, and further optimization of this strategy will probably be required to reach the goal of reduced alveolar epithelial injury in ARDS.

4056,Healthcare Workers’ Strategies for Doffing Personal Protective Equipment,2019-10-01,"BACKGROUND: Personal protective equipment (PPE) helps protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from pathogens and prevents cross-contamination. PPE effectiveness is often undermined by inappropriate doffing methods. Our knowledge of how HCWs approach doffing PPE in practice is limited. In this qualitative study, we examine HCWs’ perspectives about doffing PPE. METHODS: Thirty participants at a Midwestern academic hospital were recruited and assigned to 1 of 3 doffing simulation scenarios: 3 mask designs (n = 10), 2 gown designs (n = 10), or 2 glove designs (n = 10). Participants were instructed to doff PPE as they would in routine practice. Their performances were video-recorded and reviewed with participants. Semistructured interviews about their doffing approaches were conducted and audio-recorded, then transcribed and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Three overarching themes were identified in interviews: doffing strategies, cognitive processes, and barriers and facilitators. Doffing strategies included doffing safely (minimizing self-contamination) and doffing expediently (eg, ripping PPE off). Cognitive processes during doffing largely pertained to tracking contaminated PPE surfaces, examining PPE design cues (eg, straps), or improvising based on prior experience from training or similar PPE designs. Doffing barriers and facilitators typically related to PPE design, such as PPE fit (or lack of it) and fastener type. Some participants also described personal barriers (eg, glasses, long hair); however, some PPE designs helped mitigate these barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve HCWs’ doffing performance need to address HCWs’ preferences for both safety and expediency when using PPE, which has implications for PPE design, training approaches, and hospital policies and procedures.","Baloh, Jure; Reisinger, Heather Schacht; Dukes, Kimberly; da Silva, Jaqueline Pereira; Salehi, Hugh P; Ward, Melissa; Chasco, Emily E; Pennathur, Priyadarshini R; Herwaldt, Loreen",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6743502/,295
14728,Surfactant lung delivery with LISA and InSurE in adult rabbits with respiratory distress,2021-01-15,"Adolescent (10–19 years) mental health remains an overlooked global health issue. Rates of adolescent pregnancy within sub-Saharan Africa are some of the highest in the world and occur at the epicentre of the global HIV epidemic. Both experiencing adolescent pregnancy and living with HIV have been found to be associated with adverse mental health outcomes, when investigated separately. Poor mental health may have implications for both parent and child. The literature regarding mental health within groups experiencing both HIV and adolescent pregnancy is yet to be summarised. This systematic review sought to identify (1) the prevalence/occurrence of common mental disorder amongst adolescents who are living with HIV and have experienced pregnancy, (inclusive of adolescent fathers) in sub-Saharan Africa (2) risk and protective factors for common mental disorder among this group, and (3) interventions (prevention/treatment) for common mental disorder among this group. A systematic search of electronic databases using pre-defined search terms, supplemented by hand-searching, was undertaken in September 2020. One author and an independent researcher completed a title and abstract screening of results from the search. A full-text search of all seemingly relevant manuscripts (both quantitative and qualitative) was undertaken and data extracted using pre-determined criteria. A narrative synthesis of included studies is provided. Quality and risk of bias within included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A systematic keyword search of databases and follow-up hand searching identified 2287 unique records. Of these, thirty-eight full-text quantitative records and seven full-text qualitative records were assessed for eligibility. No qualitative records met the eligibility criteria for inclusion within the review. One quantitative record was identified for inclusion. This study reported on depressive symptomology amongst 14 pregnant adolescents living with HIV in Kenya, identifying a prevalence of 92.9%. This included study did not meet the high methodological quality of this review. No studies were identified reporting on risk and protective factors for common mental disorder, and no studies were found identifying any specific interventions for common mental disorder for this group, either for prevention or for treatment. The limited data identified within this review provides no good quality evidence relating to the prevalence of common mental disorder among adolescents living with HIV who have experienced pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa. No data was available relating to risk and protective factors or interventions for psychological distress amongst this group. This systematic review identifies a need for rigorous evidence regarding the mental health of pregnant and parenting adolescents living with HIV, and calls for granular interrogation of existing data to further our understanding of the needs of this group. The absence of research on this topic (both quantitative and qualitative) is a critical evidence gap, limiting evidence-based policy and programming responses, as well as regional development opportunities.","Roberts, Kathryn J.; Smith, Colette; Cluver, Lucie; Toska, Elona; Sherr, Lorraine",AIDS Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7810185/,295

Although the mechanism of chronic coronavirus-induced demyelination is not entirely clear, studies show that it is mostly immune-mediated. Astrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells play an important role in normal functions as well as in immunologic and pathologic processes in the central nervous system (CNS). The interaction between coronaviruses and these cells induces various inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, MHC and NO, which acting in concert are involved in the pathogenesis of demyelination.","Li, Yun; Lavi, Ehud",Experimental Models of Multiple Sclerosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121167/,295

This new learning paradigm promotes education across different contexts, which is a key factor that contributes to enhancing learning irrespective of the conditions and location of the learner. Therefore, it creates an authentic learning setting whereby students can make meaningful connections to the real world while learning takes place. Previous research works in the field of mobile learning showed that improper design of learning elements is still present in mobile systems and consequently results in poor dynamic content adaptation. Some attempts to adapt learning contents with appropriate instructional design principles are conducted, but with moderate exploitation of smart technological assets in mobile learning systems and limited pedagogical reflections and cognitive factors. In this paper, a learning efficiency model chart is derived using important learning factors that can be considered to enhance mobile learning experiences. Some popular learning theories are analysed and compared with the proposed learning efficiency model chart. This investigation is considered to significantly reduce complexities that exist in mobile learning platforms and promote an enhanced mobile learning experience.","Curum, Brita; Khedo, Kavi Kumar",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7417113/,295

To this end, I deploy Bruno Latour’s Down to Earth: Politics in the New Climatic Regime as both a framing mechanism and a heuristic device in order to focus attention on the compelling question of posthumanist political ecology. While originally published as Où atterrir? Comment s’orienter en politique in 2017, Latour’s short text has only continued to gain relevance consequent on the heavy black pall cast over society first by the Covid-19 pandemic, and then quickly followed by the political hucksterism of the Trump administration in lieu of any reasoned response—as clearly evidenced by the opportunistic refusal by the US to pay dues amounting to millions of dollars to the World Health Organization by way of an inflammatory campaign of lies and blame aimed at denying any and all responsibility for the current woes of the Earth writ large. Whereas to some this might seem to concern animal studies only obliquely, the questions brought to bear by political ecology upon the agitated thickness of geological history are among the most important facing animal studies today.","Iveson, Richard",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665711/,295

44006,533. Demographic and Prognostic Indicators in COVID-19 Patients with ESRD: A Single Center Retrospective Study,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Premature birth can affect maternal mental health. Considering that the mental health disorder in mothers may play a vital role in the growth and development of their children, therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of supportive counseling on mental health (primary outcome), mother-child bonding and infant anthropometric indices (secondary outcomes) in mothers of premature infants. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial was carried out on 66 mothers with hospitalized neonates in the NICU of Alzahra hospital in Tabriz- Iran. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups of intervention (n = 34) and control (n = 32) through a block randomization method. The intervention group received 6 sessions of supportive counseling (45–60 minutes each session) by the researcher, and the control group received routine care. Questionnaires of Goldberg General Health and the postpartum bonding were completed before the intervention (first 72 hours postpartum) and 8 weeks postpartum. Also, the anthropometric index of newborns were measured at the same time. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of socio-demographic characteristics. After the intervention, based on ANCOVA with adjusting the baseline score, mean score of mental health (AMD: -9.8; 95% Confident Interval (95% CI): -12.5 to -7.1; P < 0.001) and postpartum bonding (AMD: -10.0; 95% CI: -0.6 to 13.9; P < 0.001) in the counseling group was significantly lower than those of the control group; however, in terms of weight (P = 0.536), height (P = 0.429) and head circumference (P = 0.129), there was no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Supportive counseling may improve mental health and postpartum bonding in mothers of premature infants. Thus, it may be recommendable for health care providers to offer it to mothers.

44060,495. Effectiveness of Personal Protective Equipment in Preventing Transmission of COVID-19 in Healthcare Workers,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The HIV and COVID-19 co-infection prevalence has not been described extensively. Given the high prevalence of HIV positive patients in our population-our Designated AIDS Center (DAC) caters to approximately 600 patients-of which 68% are virally suppressed, this relationship is of great interest. The objectives of this analysis are to report the characteristics of HIV and COVID-19 patients, and to evaluate for any associations of HIV with COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all patients admitted with both HIV and confirmed COVID-19. Collected demographics, past medical history, HIV history including therapy, compliance, viral loads, and CD4 counts, and COVID-19 disease course. Evaluate baseline clinical status utilizing the World Health Organization’s Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement, and note disease outcomes. Analyzed mortality and disease severity as compared to the general COVID-19 patient population. RESULTS: 39 patients were identified with HIV and COVID-19 from March 15(th) –June 18(th) 2020. Baseline characteristics of these patients are listed in Figure 1. Of the available labs, 60% of patients were virally suppressed, and 87% had CD4+ counts above 200/µL. On admission, most patients either did not require oxygen support, or received support through noninvasive methods. In Figure 2 we see the final outcome of the patients, with 77% of the patients discharged, and a mortality rate of 18%. Of note, the only baseline characteristic that had a significant correlation with mortality among our patients was age > 60 (p = 0.03). Baseline Characteristics of HIV COVID-19 Patients and Pertinent COVID-19 Admission Statistics [Image: see text] COVID-19 Outcomes [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Mortality in our HIV COVID-19 population was 18%, significantly lower than the 33% in COVID-19 patients overall at our institution. 39 patients with HIV were admitted for confirmed COVID-19 infections, which only amounts to 6.5% of the DAC population, although it is possible that our patients were admitted to other facilities for COVID-19. In our patients, compliance, viral suppression, and CD4+ counts did not correlate with outcomes. Although our mortality was significantly lower than the overall hospital mortality, larger studies are needed to fully evaluate the mortality relationship and determine the protective effects of antiviral therapy and/or decreased immune response in HIV patients with COVID-19.

44086,380. First Reports of Salivary Gland Involvement in Corona Virus Disease 2019,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Prevention interventions for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are currently limited to non-pharmaceutical strategies. Observational and laboratory data suggested that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had biologic activity against SARS-CoV-2. A blinded trial of HCQ in persons with confirmed exposure and virologic and clinical endpoints is needed. METHODS: We conducted a national, householdrandomized, double-blind, controlled trial of HCQ post-exposure prophylaxis, with entirely remote study procedures. We enrolled close contacts exposed to persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past 96 hours. Participants were randomized to either HCQ (400 mg daily for three days followed by 200 mg daily for eleven days) or ascorbic acid (500 mg followed by 250 mg daily), as a placebo-equivalent control. Participants self-collected mid-turbinate swabs daily (days 1–14) for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed, incident SARS-CoV-2 infection among persons SARS-CoV-2 negative at enrollment. Symptoms were assessed using criteria from the US CDC. RESULTS: From March-August 2020, 623 households were randomized; 311 households (381 participants) to the HCQ group and 312 households (400 participants) to the control group. Ninety- one percent of participants were retained up to day 14 and 9,595 of 10,588 (91%) of swabs were tested. Among participants who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline (n=626/781, 80%), the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was 14.5% (95% CI: 11.6–17.4) and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 symptoms was 11.6% (95% CI: 8.9–14.2) at day 14. By day 14, there was no difference between the HCQ group and control group in SARS-CoV-2 acquisition (46 vs. 43 events, aHR= 0.99, 95% CI 0.64–1.52, p=0.95) or symptomatic disease (40 vs. 32 events, aHR= 1.23, 95% CI: 0.76–1.99, p=0.40). The adverse event frequency was similar between groups (59 [15.5%] participants in the HCQ and 45 [11.3%] in the control group, p=0.092). Cumulative incidence of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among close contacts of diagnosed cases, by study group [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: This randomized, double-blind, controlled trial among persons with recent exposure and high incidence of SAR-CoV2 provides strong evidence that HCQ post-exposure prophylaxis did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or modify clinical disease.

44089,74. Empiric Antibiotic Therapy and Community-onset Bacterial Co-infection in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19: A Multi-hospital Cohort Study,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma (CP) may be obtained from patients who have recovered from the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Although not FDA approved, preliminary data suggests patients who receive convalescent plasma from recovered donors may have shortened recovery time and symptom reduction. The purpose of the study is to detail learner recruitment of convalescent plasma donation (CPD) for treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Prisma Health Midlands formed a multidisciplinary CP donation team, consisting of seven COVID-19-certified pharmacy learner volunteers, two pharmacists, and two providers. Primary eligibility criteria were SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity at least 28 days prior to donation and asymptomatic for a minimum of 14 days. Donors were excluded based on FDA guidelines for CPD, limiting ineligible contact. Team learners were trained on call techniques and subsequently contacted, educated, and requested candidates donate through this program. Willing donors were then linked to The Blood Connection to circulate CP back into the Prisma Health System, creating a self-sustaining and closed-loop donation cycle. RESULTS: In total, 253 recovered adult patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results were evaluated. 195 patients met baseline inclusion criteria for contact. This pre-screen reduced call and travel time for ineligible candidates. 108 patients were successfully reached. Of the 108, n=79 (73.14%) accepted referral to The Blood Connection, and n=29 (26.85%) were no longer candidates primarily due to patient communicated new exclusionary factors, such as active COVID-19 symptoms. The program allowed for rapid, internal access to CP for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at Prisma Health Midlands. CONCLUSION: Interest and awareness in COVID-19 CPD was successfully increased upon direct communication from the team and was felt to represent a personnel intense but successful model for recruiting potential CP donors. This program educated and utilized learners during this pandemic to enhance Prisma Health’s ability to obtain CP for hospitalized patients using a closed system.

44092,"57. clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 in New Orleans, LA: A Cohort Study",2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The United States (US) healthcare system has experienced enormous economic impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by both loss of revenue related to shutdowns and increased strain on resources. These factors have impacted the workload and finances of physicians. METHODS: A 31-item anonymous survey evaluating the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physicians was developed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham using Qualtrics(XM) software and included questions on adverse economic impact (defined as selecting job loss, furlough or reduced income as a stressor), workload, and compensation. It was distributed via physician professional and social networks including email, Facebook groups, and #MedicalTwitter May 14-July 31, 2020. RESULTS: Among 597 respondents, 295 (49%) reported adverse economic impact, with the highest proportions among emergency medicine (71%), anesthesiologists (63%), and surgeons (60%) and lowest among infectious diseases (ID) (25%). In multivariable analysis (Table), physicians practicing in the Northeastern US saw the lowest economic impact versus the South (OR 3.44, 95% CI: 2.03–5.84), Midwest (2.62, 1.36–5.05) or West (1.98, 1.06–3.71). Physicians practicing in federal or academic settings experienced less economic impact than those in community settings (0.09, 0.03–0.30 and 0.61, 0.41–0.93 respectively). Increased work hours were identified by 185 (31%) of respondents as a stressor, with 169 (92%) reporting additional hours were partially or completely uncompensated. Among 584 respondents, 212 (36%) had new roles and responsibilities (Figure), with the highest proportion among ID physicians (75%). Table 1: Characteristics and factors associated with reporting adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among 597 physicians in the United States [Image: see text] Figure: New roles and responsbilities assumed by 212 physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased physician workload, with approximately one-third of physicians taking on new responsibilities and a similar proportion reporting increased work hours. Much of this additional work is uncompensated due to the economic impact of the pandemic on the healthcare system. Simultaneously, many physicians across the US have suffered adverse economic consequences, especially in the South. ID physicians have experienced higher workload but less economic impact, related to increased need for their expertise and new roles and responsibilities.

44121,384. Invasive aspergillosis in COVID-19 patients in an intensive care unit in Mexico City,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: There is concern that patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at risk of developing secondary bacterial and fungal infections; however, data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with fungal infections are limited. We evaluated the risk factors and mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with fungal infections. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of 51 patients with fungal infections at an 877-bed teaching hospital in Detroit, Michigan from March through May 2020. Demographic data, comorbidities, complications, treatment, and outcomes, including relapse, readmission and mortality were collected. We performed a descriptive analysis. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients with fungal infections were included, in which 31 (60.8%) had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Of the COVID-19 patients, the average age was 66 years and the majority (54.9%) were female. The average length of stay (LOS) was 29.3 days. Aspergillus sp. (2 A. fumigatus, 1 A. niger) were isolated in 3 (10%) patients while 23 (74.2%) had candidemia diagnosed via blood culture or T2Candida® Panel. One had a positive serum galactomannan. The average time from admission to diagnosis was 13 days. Significant comorbidities included hypertension (74%), diabetes (51.6%), coronary artery disease (25.8%), congestive heart failure (32.2%), chronic kidney disease (22.6%), and malignancy (16.1%). Most patients received steroids (83.9%) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (80.6%), had a central line (80.6%), and required intensive care unit management (90%). Only 71% were treated with antifungals. One patient with candidemia relapsed due to poor source control; two were readmitted within 30 days. In-hospital mortality rate was 51.6% among COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with fungal infections had multiple comorbidities, prolonged hospitalization and predisposing risk factors for fungal infections with a high in-hospital mortality rate.

44128,399. Risk Factors for Mortality in COVID-19 Patients in a Community Teaching Hospital,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV2 infections (Covid-19) are frequently febrile and can become critically ill quickly often leading to intervention with antimicrobial therapy. An etiologic diagnosis of superinfections can be difficult to obtain through the usual invasive procedures because of patient instability and the desire to avoid them because they may not be tolerated by the patient. Providers may also be hesitant to embark on such interventions in order to avoid healthcare personnel (HCP) exposure to aerosols. METHODS: Karius Test (KT) results are presented from 30 patients who presented with Covid-19. The KT is a CLIA certified/CAP-accredited next-generation sequencing (NGS) plasma test that detects pathogen cell free DNA (cfDNA). After cfDNA is extracted and NGS performed, human reads are removed and remaining sequences are aligned to a curated database of > 1400 organisms. Organisms present above a statistical threshold are reported. RESULTS: The KT detected pathogens in the majority of patients (n=20) with COVID-19. The most common infections were herpesviruses in 60% of patients. The most common bacterial pathogen was E. coli seen in 25% of patients. 15 out of 20 patients had more than one pathogen detected. 15% of patients had fungal pathogens, including one detection of Lichtheimia ramosa, in an immunocompromised patient. The results are summarized in the table. Co-infections detected by the Karius Test in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Open-ended, plasma-based NGS for mcfDNA provides a non-invasive method to assess for co-infections in critically ill patients with COVID-19. This report highlights the potential to increase diagnostic yield as well as to decrease the need for invasive procedures – and their attendant risks to patients and HCP – to obtain etiologic diagnoses to better inform antimicrobial therapy for superinfection. It also serves to highlight the variety of pathogens affecting these patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCLOSURES: William V.

Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19 treated with Convalescent Plasma in Miami, Florida",2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the early weeks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in New York City posed unique challenges. Due to inadequate testing availability and long turnaround times, decisions on which patients to isolate were problematic. With sensitivity comparable to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the absence of ground glass opacities (GGOs) on chest CT scan was useful to rule out COVID-19. We evaluated the specificity of chest CT scan findings for COVID-19 along with other clinical and laboratory findings. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was done of 182 adult patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and underwent a chest CT scan while admitted to Maimonides Medical Center between March 1 to 23, 2020. Cases were defined as those with a positive RT-PCR result or who were treated for COVID-19. Negative cases were defined as those with negative RT-PCR and an alternative diagnosis confirmed by an ID physician. Beyond March 23, almost all newly admitted patients were isolated. RESULTS: There were 111 COVID-19 positive and 71 COVID-19 negative patients. Of the COVID-19 patients, 61% were male and 39% female, 56% white, 20% Hispanic, 14% black, 9% Asian, 36% Jewish, 35% had diabetes mellitus (DM), 50% had hypertension and 42% had cardiovascular disease. Clinical symptoms, signs, and laboratory values for COVID-19 positive and negative groups were not significantly different. COVID-19 patients had significantly higher BMI (p = 0.001). On chest CT scan, bilateral or unilateral, peripheral distribution and lower lobar GGOs were over 80% specific for COVID-19. The frequency of GGOs was significantly higher when chest CT scans were done during the second week of illness compared to the first week (p = 0.0195). Jewish patients were associated with higher rates of death (p = 0.0475) and underlying DM was associated with higher rates of ARDS, AKI, intubation, ICU admission and death (p < 0.05) compared to other demographic and comorbid groups. CONCLUSION: Chest CT scan is an important component in the diagnostic process for patients with suspected COVID-19 infection, especially during the second week of symptoms. The findings may aid clinical decisions in the setting of a second surge of SARS-CoV-2.

44149,71. Use of Intravenous Immunoglobulin Therapy Reduces Progression to Mechanical Ventilation in COVID-19 Patients with Moderate to Severe Hypoxia,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend testing for SARS-COV-2 in asymptomatic individuals who are undergoing time-sensitive major surgery or aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) to guide infection prevention practices, including PPE use, and minimize risk of potential poor outcomes associated with COVID-19 infection by delaying the procedure in positive patients. However, evidence to support these recommendations are limited. We describe the outcome of asymptomatic patients with SARS-COV-2 undergoing surgery or AGPs. METHODS: We implemented a system-wide policy to test all patients requiring intubation or other AGPs at Henry Ford Health System (HFHS), a 5-hospital system in southeast Michigan. This was a retrospective review of asymptomatic surgical patients with COVID-19 infection between 5/1/2020–5/31/2020. All patients with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of upper respiratory tract were included. Demographics, comorbidities, procedural/surgical categories, symptoms and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: 4381 COVID-19 PCR tests were performed pre-procedurally during the study period, of which 18 (0.4%) were positive. Summary of characteristics is presented in Table 1. Mean age was 49.7 years, and the majority were female (61%) and black (67%). Six (33%) of 18 surgeries were performed despite positive COVID-19 PCR as shown in Table 2. Of those who had the procedure performed, none developed symptoms within 14 days. Two (11%) patients developed symptoms within 14 days of positive PCR after their procedures were canceled. None of those who had their procedure delayed developed any symptoms. Of the total patients, none required hospitalization or died. Table 1. Characteristics of asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection [Image: see text] Table 2. Outcome of procedure in asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 infection was very low in our asymptomatic patient population. Decisions around SARS-CoV-2 testing in asymptomatic patients undergoing procedures should be based on exposure history and prevalence of disease in the community to avoid unnecessary testing and diversion of resources away from symptomatic patients.

Share prices contain information about the current and future state of the economy. We investigate whether different measures of optimism, all of which contain the unanticipated increase in share prices, affect key macroeconomic variations. In particular, do bouts of optimism stimulate economic growth? If so, are the economic booms sustained for a long period of time? To answer our research questions, we use structural vector autoregression models, and three different identification strategies. We address the interdependence between interest rate shocks and stock market shocks, using short-run and long-run restrictions, as in Bjørnland and Leitemo (J Monet Econ 56(2): 275–282, 2009).

The results from a sample of 1,172 Amazon MTurk users collected in July 2020 suggest that EIP use varied across spending and financial transaction categories. Those with job instability, less financial resources, and more people to care for received essential support. A smaller proportion of the population spent at least some of their EIP on their wants. Americans' primarily focused their EIP spending on housing, food, and hobbies. In addition, people were able to improve their financial situation through investing and debt reduction. Decisions to save the EIP were related to economic recovery concerns; a broad policy package and public messaging strategy that offers assurance of economic recovery and stability might enhance policy effectiveness for boosting immediate economic growth through EIP spending.","Asebedo, Sarah D.; Liu, Yi; Gray, Blake; Quadria, Taufiq Hasan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883179/,295

For the music therapy profession and those populations that can benefit from its application, the ramifications are no less palpable, though they have been changing on a day-today basis. During the initial phase of the pandemic, the expressive therapy team, including the music therapists at Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City, was directed to work remotely using virtual platforms to facilitate services. Several studies conducted both prior to the pandemic and since its arrival in the United States demonstrate the delivery of expressive therapies via remote, web-based platforms. However, there is a general lack of literature on the subject. This article brings forward 3 case examples in order to illustrate the methods of achieving goals and objectives in distanced music therapy: a 5-year-old girl needing a heart transplant, an 11-year-old girl requiring tri-weekly hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease, and 2 brothers whose sister died of rhabdomyosarcoma and who was treated at Primary Children’s Hospital.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective, record-linked cohort study and questionnaire about lifestyle changes in patients who visited our department in 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: We surveyed 1316 outpatients in 2019 and 1284 in 2020. The most common underlying diseases were rheumatoid arthritis (842 vs. 814) and systemic lupus erythematosus (126 vs. 127). No significant difference in median age (66 vs. 67 years), respiratory comorbidities (30.4% vs. 32.0%), or corticosteroid use (42.2% vs. 44.3%) was found between the years. Immunomodulating agents were used more in 2020 (33.1% vs. 39.7%, p<.001).

This process requires substantial epigenetic and transcriptional rewiring to ultimately repress the nB program and replace it with one conducive to ASC physiology and function. Notably, these reprogramming events occur within the framework of cell division. Efforts to understand the relationship of cell division with reprogramming and ASC differentiation in vivo have uncovered the timing and scope of reprogramming, as well as key factors that influence these events. Herein, we discuss the unique physiology of ASC and how nBs undergo epigenetic and genome architectural reorganization to acquire the necessary functions to support antibody production. We also discuss the stage-wise manner in which reprogramming occurs across cell divisions and how key molecular determinants can influence B cell fate outcomes.","Patterson, Dillon G; Kania, Anna K; Zuo, Zhihong; Scharer, Christopher D; Boss, Jeremy M",Immunological reviews,https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34010461/,295

Furthermore, compared to a VATS thymectomy via the lateral chest, decreased use of postoperative analgesics (lower doses and shorter duration), decreased blood loss, and shorter surgical duration and hospital stay have been reported. Here we report our surgical method and solutions for a uniportal subxiphoid VATS thymectomy. A uniportal subxiphoid VATS thymectomy is indicated for patients with myasthenia gravis and anterior mediastinal tumors who do not require surgical suturing. The operator stands between the patient's legs and the scopist stands to the right of the patient to operate the camera scope. To begin with, a 3-cm transverse incision was made along Langer's lines 1 cm caudal below the xiphoid process. The CO2 insufflation is performed in the mediastinum at 8 mmHg. The pericardial adipose tissue and thymus are detached from the pericardium in an anterior manner from the bilateral phrenic nerves. The resected thymus is placed in a pouch in the mediastinum and removed from the body through the subxiphoid incision. The subxiphoid approach is highly beneficial for the patient in that it results in superior esthetic outcomes considering that there is no sternotomy and no intercostal nerve damage; thus, it is a surgical procedure that surgeons should learn.","Suda, Takashi",Journal of visualized surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/jovs.2016.07.03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29399508/,295

METHODS In this multicenter study, 54 patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis were included. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed from three tertiary care hospitals between 1979 and 2019. Also, current information and the long-term progress of patients was determined by contacting the families by telephone. RESULTS A total of 54 children were included. The median age of onset of symptoms was 4.5 years (3 months to 15.8 years). The median time from onset to diagnosis was 0.9 years (0.25 months to 12 years). The mean number of recurrent episodes per child in the recurrence-positive group was 3.55 (1-15). Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients presenting with hypoxia or requiring transfusion at the time of presentation had significantly more recurrence episodes (P=0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of hypoxia at the time of initial presentation was a significant independent predictor of recurrent episodes (P=0.027). The median follow-up was 3.3 years (0.75 months-27 years). There was a significant relationship between the presence of hypoxia, transfusion history, ANA positivity, and elevated transaminases at the time of initial evaluation and treatment response. CONCLUSIONS The present study provides substantial information regarding factors that may affect recurrent exacerbations and prognosis in children with idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis.

70374,Co-detection of respiratory pathogens in patients hospitalized with Coronavirus viral disease-2019 pneumonia.,2020-04-22,"Vascular anomalies are a diverse group of pathologic conditions. They have different manifestations, natural histories, and treatments. Compared with other vascular malformations, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are considered the most symptomatic and difficult to manage. AVMs inherently progress and have a high rate of recurrence after treatment. Imaging helps provide an accurate and early diagnosis, which can then be used to direct appropriate management, with embolization evolving as the primary therapy. Thus, radiology plays a crucial role in the detection, workup, and management of AVMs. Ultrasonography (US) is a useful initial imaging modality, particularly when AVMs involve the extremities or a superficial or accessible location. Limitations include poor identification of soft-tissue and bone components, as well as suboptimal evaluation of deep or complex AVMs. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography is the preferred imaging modality for AVMs and should be considered in any symptomatic patient or in the initial evaluation of vascular anomalies that are equivocal at US. Computed tomographic angiography should be reserved for those patients who are unable to undergo MR angiography or for evaluation of acute symptoms, such as bleeding or airway compromise. Conventional catheter-based angiography is useful for real-time depiction and evaluation of AVMs, particularly in the planning and execution of endovascular treatment and in the diagnosis of an AVM when findings from noninvasive imaging are equivocal for a high-flow component. As with the diagnostic workup, MR angiography is the preferred posttreatment modality.

In contrast to their protective anti-microbial functions, inappropriate or excessive activation of nucleic acid sensors can cause inflammatory diseases. Nucleic acid sensing is therefore tightly controlled by regulatory factors acting through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Recently, it has become clearer that metabolic pathways-previously thought to be unconnected with immune responses-can influence nucleic acid sensing. This regulation can be observed when immune system cells undergo metabolic reprogramming in response to stimulation with pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharide from gram negative bacteria. Metabolic reprogramming leads to accumulation and secretion of metabolites, which have been mostly viewed as end-products of processes providing cellular energy and building blocks. However, metabolites have now been identified as important regulators of nucleic acid sensing. This mini-review aims to outline current knowledge on regulation of central nucleic acid sensing pathways by metabolites during metabolic reprogramming.","Blay-Cadanet, Julia; Pedersen, Alice; Holm, Christian Kanstrup",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.635738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33679790/,295

Analyzing the available literature, there is very scarce evidence regarding the use of MIS and robotics for treatment of pediatric surgical and urological pathologies during this pandemic. However, we found some useful information that we would like to share with other pediatric surgeons and urologists through this journal. Based upon the available data, we believe that surgery should only be performed in pediatric patients with emergent/urgent and oncological indications until resolution of the COVID-19 outbreak. Robotics and MIS may be safely performed in such selected children by adopting specific technical precautions such as prevention of aerosol dispersion using filters/suction or adapted systems and appropriate use of electrocautery and other sealing devices for reduction of surgical smoke, as reported in our recent experience. Another key point to manage this pandemic emergency is that all hospitals should provide health care professionals with adequate individual protections and perform universal screening in all patients undergoing surgery. Considering that this pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation with new information available daily, these data resulting from the analysis of literature focused on pediatric robotics and MIS may be further revised and updated.","Esposito, Ciro; Masieri, Lorenzo; Castagnetti, Marco; Crocetto, Felice; Escolino, Maria",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

In particular, single-cell profiling of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can provide unique insights into tumor heterogeneity (including in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)), while scRNA-seq leads to better understanding of subclonal architecture and biological function. Despite numerous reports suggesting a direct correlation between circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and poor clinical outcomes, few studies have provided a thorough heterogeneity characterization of CTCs. In addition, TNBC is a disease with not only intertumor but also intratumor heterogeneity and represents various biological distinct subgroups that may have relationships with immune functions that are not clearly established yet. In this article, we introduce a new scheme for detecting genotypic characterization of single-cell heterogeneities and apply it to CTC and TNBC single-cell RNA-seq data. First, we use an existing mixture exponential family graph model to partition the cell-cell network; then, with the Markov random field model, we obtain more flexible network rewiring. Finally, we find the cell heterogeneity and network relationships according to different high coexpression gene modules in different cell subsets. Our results demonstrate that this scheme provides a reasonable and effective way to model different cell clusters and different biological enrichment gene clusters. Thus, using different internal coexpression genes of different cell clusters, we can infer the differences in tumor composition and diversity.","Wang, Yishu; Tian, Xuehan; Ai, Dongmei",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9919080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095314/,295

In this review, we focused on the different imaging techniques trying to highlight the strengths and disadvantages of different approaches, particularly for ultrasound techniques, in stratifying liver injury and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD / NASH.","Miele, Luca; Zocco, Maria A; Pizzolante, Fabrizio; De Matthaeis, Nicoletta; Ainora, Maria E; Liguori, Antonio; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Grieco, Antonio; Rapaccini, Gianludovico",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916154/,295

93110,[Discussion of Medical Protective Consumables Management to Fight against COVID-19 Pneumonia].,2020-03-08,"Introduction: The study of motor responses induced by electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) may help clarify the role of the vestibular system in postural control. Although back muscles have an important role in postural control, their EVS-induced motor responses were rarely studied. Moreover, the effects of EVS parameters, head position, and vision on EVS-induced back muscles responses remain little explored. Objectives: To explore the effects of EVS parameters, head position, and vision on lumbar erector spinae muscles EVS-induced responses. Design: Exploratory, cross-sectional study. Materials and Methods: Ten healthy participants were recruited. Three head positions (right, left and no head rotation), 4 intensities (2, 3, 4, 5 mA), and 4 EVS durations (5, 20, 100, 200 ms) were tested in sitting position with eyes open or closed. EVS usually induced a body sway toward the anode (placed on the right mastoid). EMG activity of the right lumbar erector spinae was recorded. Variables of interest were amplitude, occurrence, and latency of the EVS-induced modulation of the EMG activity. Results: The short-latency response was inhibitory and the medium-latency response was excitatory. Increased EVS current intensity augmented the occurrence and the amplitude of the short- and medium-latency responses (more inhibition and more excitation, respectively). EVS duration influenced the medium-latency response differently depending on the position of the head. Right head rotation produced larger responses amplitude and occurrence than left head rotation. Opposite head rotation (left vs. right) did not induce a reversal of the short- and medium-latency responses (i.e., the inhibition did not become an excitation), as typically reported in lower legs muscles. The eyes open condition did not modulate muscle responses. Conclusion: Modulation of EVS parameters (current intensity and duration of EVS) affects the amplitude and occurrence of the lumbar erector spinae responses. In contrast, vision did not influence the responses, suggesting its minimal contribution to vestibulomotor control in sitting. The lack of response reversal in sagittal plane may reflect the biomechanical role of lumbar erector spinae to fine-tune the lumbar lordosis during the induced body sway. This hypothesis remains to be further tested.","Desgagnés, Amélie; Desmons, Mikaël; Cyr, Jean-Philippe; Simoneau, Martin; Massé-Alarie, Hugo",Frontiers in human neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2021.690433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366814/,295
96981,Behavioural insights and attitudes on community masking during the initial spread of COVID-19 in Hong Kong.,2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) following proctocolectomy is the preferred option for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis, indeterminate colitis, and familial adenomatous polyposis. However, it remains a procedure associated with morbidity and mortality. Pelvic sepsis, pouch fistulae, and anastomotic dehiscence predispose to pouch failure. We report our experience with an adaptation for the formation of the stapled ileal J pouch using the GIA™ 100 stapling device (Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts, USA). When creating the J pouch, we remove the bevelled plastic protector from the thin fork of the stapling device, allowing the staple line to be completed to the tip of the stapled efferent limb of the pouch, thereby minimizing potential blind ending in the efferent limb and injury to the transverse staple line. METHODS Patients undergoing elective IPAA at our institution over a 5-year period using this adapted stapling technique for creation of the ileal J pouch were reviewed. Data were collected from a prospectively maintained inflammatory bowel disease database, theater records, and patient chart review. RESULTS Forty-one patients underwent IPAA using this technique at our institution during the study period. Postoperative morbidity was encountered in 11 of 41 patients including pelvic sepsis, pouch fistulae, anastomotic stricture, or leak. There was no morbidity observed related to a blind efferent limb or transverse staple line disruption. No mortality was observed in this series. CONCLUSION Maximizing the length of the efferent fork of the GIA stapling device can reduce the length of redundant efferent J limb of the ileal J pouch. This may reduce the incidence of torsion, volvulus, distension, fistulae/sinuses, and pelvic sepsis/anastomotic leak following IPAA.","Martin, S T; Tevlin, R; Heeney, A; Peirce, C; Hyland, J M; Winter, D C",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-011-0757-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21984050/,295
99841,Tracking clinical resources for coronavirus disease 2019.,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Intracranial hemorrhage is the most dreaded complication of neurothrombectomy therapy for acute ischemic stroke. The determinants of intracranial hemorrhage and its impact on clinical course remain incompletely delineated. The purpose of this study is to further investigate the clinical and procedural factors leading to intracranial hemorrhage and to define the clinical impact of different hemorrhagic subtypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed data prospectively collected in the Solitaire FR With Intention for Thrombectomy randomized clinical trial. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify independent clinical, imaging, and procedural predictors of any intracranial hemorrhage and of 7 intracranial hemorrhage subtypes. Univariate analysis was used to determine the impact of each of the intracranial hemorrhage subtypes on clinical outcome. RESULTS Among the 144 enrolled patients, any radiologic intracranial hemorrhage (21.3% versus 38.2%, P = .035), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (1.1% versus 10.9%, P = .012), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (2.2% versus 12.7%, P = .027) occurred less frequently in the Solitaire FR than in the Merci retriever arms. The most common independent determinant of hemorrhage occurrence was rescue therapy with intra-arterial rtPA, which was associated with any intracranial hemorrhage and 4 subtypes and tended to be used more frequently in the Merci group (10.9% versus 3.4%; P = .09). Among the hemorrhage subtypes, basal ganglionic hemorrhage had the strongest impact on good clinical outcome at 90 days (OR, 0.30; P = .025) and was associated with higher reperfusion, prolonged time to treatment, and rescue therapy with intra-arterial rtPA. CONCLUSIONS Intracranial hemorrhage, especially subarachnoid and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, occurs less frequently with the Solitaire FR than the Merci retriever, in part due to less frequent use of rescue therapy with intra-arterial rtPA. Basal ganglionic hemorrhage strongly affects clinical outcome and is distinctively related to late reperfusion.","Raychev, R; Jahan, R; Liebeskind, D; Clark, W; Nogueira, R G; Saver, J",AJNR.

METHODS This was a cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire answered by adults and elderly people to collect information on living conditions, health and health-related behaviors. Prevalence rates and prevalence ratios adjusted for age and sex were estimated. RESULTS The data on 45,161 Brazilian respondents showed that during the pandemic 40.4% (95%CI 39.0;41.8) frequently felt sad or depressed and 52.6% (95%CI 51.2;54.1) frequently felt anxious or nervous; 43.5% (95%CI 41.8;45.3) reported the onset of sleep problems and 48.0% (95%CI 45.6;50.5) had a prior sleep problem that had become worse. Frequent sadness and nervousness, as well as change in sleep patterns were higher in young adults, women and those with a history of depression.

Our first objective was to identify behavioral language and speech markers of early-stage PPA. Our second objective was to identify the electrophysiological correlates of the language and speech characteristics in PPA. Method The databases MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase were searched for relevant articles. To identify behavioral markers, the initial subjective complaints and the language and speech deficits detected during the initial diagnostic evaluation were summarized for PPA in general and each clinical variant according to the 2011 consensus diagnostic criteria (nonfluent variant [NFV], semantic variant, and logopenic variant [LV]). To identify electrophysiological markers, the studies in which event-related potentials (ERPs) were elicited by a language or speech paradigm in patients with PPA were included. Results In total, 114 relevant studies were identified, including 110 behavioral studies and only four electrophysiological studies. This review suggests that patients with the semantic variant could be accurately differentiated from the NFV and LV in the initial stages based on the consensus criteria. Nonetheless, the early differentiation between the NFV and LV is not straightforward. In the four electrophysiological studies, differences in the latency, amplitude, and topographical distribution of the semantic N400 component were found between patients with PPA and healthy controls. Conclusions To accurately differentiate the NFV from the LV, it could be important to assess the language and speech degeneration by more specific assessments and by more objective diagnostic methods that offer insights into the language-related processes. Electrophysiological markers of PPA were not identified in this review due to the low number of studies that investigated language-related ERPs. More controlled ERP studies in larger patient cohorts are needed to investigate the diagnostic applicability of language-related ERPs in PPA.

Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are widely used to detect serum antibodies for herd monitoring and prevalence studies. In dairy herds, milk is more readily collected than serum. Hence, in order to investigate the test agreement between serum and milk, both serum and milk samples from 105 cows in 27 dairy herds were analyzed in parallel for presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies to BCV and BRSV. The Bland-Altman analyses of data demonstrated good agreement between serum and milk antibody titers for both viruses.

122942,Responding to COVID-19 in Hong Kong.,2020-06-11,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses significant challenges in psychiatric hospitals, particularly in the context of the treatment of people under involuntary commitment. The question arises at various points in the procedure for and process of involuntary commitment whether procedural modifications or further restrictive measures are necessary to minimise the spread of COVID-19 and protect all people involved from infection. In the light of current developments in Germany, this article examines under which conditions changes in the treatment of people under involuntary commitment are ethically justified in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among others, we discuss ethical arguments for and against involuntary commitments with reference to COVID-19, the use of different coercive interventions, the introduction of video hearings, an increased use of video surveillance and interventions based on the German Infection Protection Act. We argue that strict hygiene concepts, the provision of sufficient personal protective equipment and frequent testing for COVID-19 should be the central strategies to ensure the best possible protection against infection. Any further restrictions of the liberty of people under involuntary commitment require a sound ethical justification based on the criteria of suitability, necessity and proportionality. A strict compliance with these criteria and the continued oversight by external and independent control mechanisms are important to prevent ethically unjustified restrictions and discrimination against people with the diagnosis of a mental disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gather, J; Juckel, G; Henking, T; Efkemann, S A; Vollmann, J; Scholten, M",International journal of law and psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181473/,295

Therefore, in order to reduce COVID-19 related comorbidities in obese population a continuation of obesity treatment is needed. However, bariatric procedures were postponed because of COVID-19 restrictions, delaying treatment for obese patients seeking for surgery. This study aimed to test the feasibility of a telematics pre-operative psychological and nutritional assessment as an alternative tool during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS Twenty-six patients were contacted. The pre-operative assessment consisted in 3-weekly one-to-one online sessions and a final in-person multidisciplinary session. The protocol feasibility has been evaluated on the following outcome: rejection rate (%), dropout rate (%), compliance and satisfaction's degree. RESULTS Eighteen participants completed the whole protocol and 10% dropped-out. Seventy-two percent of participants obtained an excess weight loss ≥5%. All participants were satisfied of the telematics assessment.

STUDY DESIGN All study subjects were followed for a minimum of 6 months after operation. Numerous demographic, clinical, treatment, and outcomes-related perioperative factors were recorded to determine statistical association with the primary end point: incisional hernia development. The first analysis was designed to establish the statistical model (scoring system) for estimating the risk of incisional hernia within 6 months of midline laparotomy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. A simple additive model was constructed using stepwise logistic and linear regression. The second part of the study analysis was validation of the scoring systems developed initially. RESULTS A logistic linear minimum regression model was developed based on four covariates independently predictive of incisional hernia: Body mass index (BMI) > 24.4kg/m(2); fascial suture to incision ratio (SIR) < 4.2; deep surgical site, deep space, or organ infection (SSI); and time to suture removal or complete epithelialization >16 days (TIME). The hernia risk scoring system equation [p(%) = 32(SIR) + 30(SSI) + 9(TIME) + 2(BMI)] provided accurate estimates of incisional hernia according to stratified risk groups based on total score: low (0 to 5 points), 1.0%; moderate (6 to 15 points), 9.7%; increased (16 to 50 points), 30.2%; and markedly increased (>50 points), 73.1%. CONCLUSIONS A statistically valid, straightforward, and clinically useful predictive model was developed for estimating the risk of incisional hernia within 6 months of midline laparotomy.

127593,First Test of an Automated Detection Platform to Identify Risk of Decompensation in Elderly Patients.,2020,"In the early 2000s, data from the latest World Health Organization estimates paint a picture where one-seventh of the world population needs at least one assistive device. Fortunately, these years are also characterized by a marked technological drive which takes the name of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In this terrain, robotics is making its way through more and more aspects of everyday life, and robotics-based assistance/rehabilitation is considered one of the most encouraging applications. Providing high-intensity rehabilitation sessions or home assistance through low-cost robotic devices can be indeed an effective solution to democratize services otherwise not accessible to everyone. However, the identification of an intuitive and reliable real-time control system does arise as one of the critical issues to unravel for this technology in order to land in homes or clinics. Intention recognition techniques from surface ElectroMyoGraphic (sEMG) signals are referred to as one of the main ways-to-go in literature. Nevertheless, even if widely studied, the implementation of such procedures to real-case scenarios is still rarely addressed. In a previous work, the development and implementation of a novel sEMG-based classification strategy to control a fully-wearable Hand Exoskeleton System (HES) have been qualitatively assessed by the authors. This paper aims to furtherly demonstrate the validity of such a classification strategy by giving quantitative evidence about the favourable comparison to some of the standard machine-learning-based methods.

Increased renal afferent and efferent sympathetic activity carried by nerves which arborize the adventitia of the renal arteries, appears to be central to the pathobiology of resistant hypertension. Historical experience indicates that surgical denervation and/or sympathectomy often dramatically reduced blood pressure in patients with malignant hypertension. Catheter-based radio-frequency renal denervation was developed in the past decade as a percutaneous adaptation of surgical denervation. Percutaneous renal denervation using a variety of systems has demonstrated to date, in non-randomized and unblinded studies, dramatic reductions in office-based blood pressure, but more modest impact on ambulatory blood pressure. The only single, appropriately powered, blinded, sham-controlled study of renal denervation conducted to date, however, failed to meet its primary endpoint, casting doubt on the value of the therapy. Ancillary benefits of renal denervation have been described in such conditions as diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and sleep apnea but require further study. While renal denervation is already widely available outside of the USA for commercial use, its utility in resistant hypertension must be vetted by further rigorous investigation before its use can be routinely recommended.","Nathan, Sandeep; Bakris, George L",Current hypertension reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11906-014-0494-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25304105/,295

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been prescribed as the first-line therapy for pain relief from dysmenorrhea. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of the daily recommended dose (150 mg) of diclofenac potassium, administered at set intervals across the first 24 h of menstruation, in treating severe menstrual pain in 24 women with severe primary dysmenorrhea. METHODS In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study, women rated their menstrual pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analog scale across set time intervals over a 24-h period. RESULTS Menstrual pain intensity was significantly reduced after taking the first capsule of diclofenac, and remained consistently lower (P < 0.0001), compared with initial pain intensity, in the morning (before treatment), throughout the day, evening, and into the next morning. Also, women rated their pain intensity as significantly lower (P < 0.001) at each time point across the 24-h time interval of the cycle when receiving diclofenac compared with the cycle when they received placebo. No woman required rescue medication when taking diclofenac potassium compared with six women taking rescue medications during the placebo trial. When taking only placebo, women rated their menstrual pain intensity as persistently severe across the first 24 h of menstruation. CONCLUSION These results show that the recommended daily dose of diclofenac potassium, in three 50 mg doses across the day and evening, offers effective menstrual pain relief across 24 h, compared with placebo, in women with severe primary dysmenorrhea.","Iacovides, Stella; Baker, Fiona C; Avidon, Ingrid",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-013-3073-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24190696/,295

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic factors in treatment of acute cholecystitis. METHODS Patients with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis who underwent CCY versus PC were reviewed from the U.S. Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database between 2008-2014. Measured variables including age, race/ethnicity, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), hospital type/region, insurance payer, household income, length of stay (LOS), hospital cost, and mortality were compared using chi-square and ANOVA. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify specific predictors of cholecystitis treatment. RESULTS A total of 1,492,877 patients (CCY:n=1,435,255 versus PC:n=57,622) were analyzed. The majority of patients that received PC were at urban teaching hospitals (65.2%). LOS was significantly longer with higher associated costs for PC [(11.1±11.0 versus 4.5±5.3 days; P<0.001) and ($99577±138850 versus $48399±58330; P<0.001)]. Mortality was also increased for patients that received PC compared to CCY (8.8% versus 0.6%; P<0.001). Multivariable regression demonstrated multiple socioeconomic and healthcare-related factors influencing the utilization of PC including male gender, Black or Asian race/ethnicity, Medicare payer status, urban hospital location, and household income (all P<0.001). CONCLUSION Although patients receiving PC had higher CCI scores, multiple socioeconomic and healthcare related factors appeared to also influence this treatment decision.

Patients exhibit growth retardation, delayed bone development, anemia, and bradycardia. By using mouse models of RTHalpha much has been learned about the molecular actions of TRalpha 1 mutants that underlie these abnormalities in adults. Using zebrafish models of RTHalpha that we have recently created, we aimed to understand how TRalpha1 mutants affect the heart function during this period. METHODS In contrast to human and mice, the thra gene is duplicated, thraa and thrab, in zebrafish. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis, we created C-terminal mutations in the each of two duplicated thra genes in zebrafish (thraa 8-bp insertion or thrab 1-bp insertion mutations). We recently showed that these mutant fish faithfully recapitulated growth retardation as found in patients and thra mutant mice. In the present studies, we used histological analysis, gene expression profiles, confocal fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to comprehensively analyze the phenotypic characteristics of mutant fish heart during development. RESULTS We found both a dilated atrium and an abnormally shaped ventricle in adult mutant fish. The retention of red blood cells in the two abnormal heart chambers, and decreased circulating blood speed and reduced expression of contractile genes indicated the weakened contractility in the heart of mutant fish. These abnormalities were detected in mutant fish as early as 35 days post fertilization (juveniles). Further, the expression of genes associated with the sarcomere assembly was suppressed in the heart of mutant fish, resulting in abnormalities of sarcomere organization as revealed by TEM. The abnormal sarcomere organization could underlie the bradycardia exhibited in mutant fish. CONCLUSIONS Using a zebrafish model of RTHalpha, the present studies demonstrated for the first time that TRalpha mutants could act to cause abnormal heart structure, weaken contractility and disrupt sarcomere organization that affect heart functions. These findings provide new insights into the bradycardia found in RTHalpha patients.","Han, Cho Rong; Wang, Hui; Hoffmann, Victoria; Zerfas, Patricia; Kruhlak, Michael; Cheng, Sheue-Yann",Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/thy.2020.0332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32762296/,295
136410,Photodynamic Therapy and Photobiomodulation on Oral Lesion in Patient with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Case Report.,2021-05-18,"Adrenal insufficiency can arise from a primary adrenal disorder, secondary to adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency, or by suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone by exogenous glucocorticoid or opioid medications. Hallmark clinical features are unintentional weight loss, anorexia, postural hypotension, profound fatigue, muscle and abdominal pain, and hyponatraemia. Additionally, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency usually develop skin hyperpigmentation and crave salt. Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is usually delayed because the initial presentation is often non-specific; physician awareness must be improved to avoid adrenal crisis. Despite state-of-the-art steroid replacement therapy, reduced quality of life and work capacity, and increased mortality is reported in patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. Active and repeated patient education on managing adrenal insufficiency, including advice on how to increase medication during intercurrent illness, medical or dental procedures, and profound stress, is required to prevent adrenal crisis, which occurs in about 50% of patients with adrenal insufficiency after diagnosis. It is good practice for physicians to provide patients with a steroid card, parenteral hydrocortisone, and training for parenteral hydrocortisone administration, in case of vomiting or severe illness. New modes of glucocorticoid delivery could improve the quality of life in some patients with adrenal insufficiency, and further advances in oral and parenteral therapy will probably emerge in the next few years.","Husebye, Eystein S; Pearce, Simon H; Krone, Nils P; Kämpe, Olle",Lancet,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(21)00136-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33484633/,295

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the 2017 National Survey of Older Koreans, which was conducted on 10,299 adults aged 65 and older in 2017 by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. RESULTS This study included a total of 6,134 women aged 65-106, with a mean age of 74.8. In total, 1,152 women experienced at least 1 fall in the past 1 year and 382 experienced 2 or more recurrent falls; 281 women were diagnosed with UI. UI and falls (odds ratio, 1.329; 95 % confidence interval, 1.003-1.762) and recurrent falls (odds ratio=,1.703; 95% confidence interval=,1.145-2.534) were significantly associated. Older individuals with UI were more likely to fall at least once per year (odds ratio=,1.52; 95 % confidence interval=,1.15-2.20, odds ratio=,1.49; 95 % confidence interval=,1.09-2.04) than those without and were also linked to higher odds of recurrent falls (odds ratio=,2.16; 95 % confidence interval=,1.47-3.16, odds ratio=,2.13; 95 % confidence interval=,1.41-3.22) in those with at least 1 cognitive impairment, body functional impairment, or activity limitation. CONCLUSION Our findings showed a possible increased risk of falls and recurrent falls in older individuals with UI compared to those without, especially in people with cognitive and functional impairment.","Moon, Shinje; Chung, Hye Soo; Yu, Jae Myung; Na, Hae Ri; Kim, Sung Jin; Ko, Kwang Jin; Choi, Don Kyoung; Kwon, Ohseong; Lee, Young Goo; Cho, Sung Tae",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2020.104158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32622241/,295

This decline is the primary risk factor for prominent human pathologies such as cancer, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Aging and age-related diseases have multiple causes. Parabiosis experiments, in which the circulatory systems of young and old mice were surgically joined, revealed that young plasma counteracts aging and rejuvenates organs in old mice, suggesting the existence of rejuvenating factors that become less abundant with aging. Diverse approaches have identified a large number of plasma proteins whose levels differ significantly between young and old mice, as well as numerous rejuvenating factors that reverse aged-related impairments in multiple tissues. These observations suggest that increasing the levels of key rejuvenating factors could promote restorative biological processes or inhibit pathological degeneration. Inspired by such findings, several companies have begun selling ""young blood transfusions,"" and others have tested young plasma as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Here, we summarize the current findings regarding rejuvenating factors.","Kang, Jae Sook; Yang, Yong Ryoul",Aging,https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197235/,295

We sought to determine the specific mediators that are associated with more severe illness in young children. METHODS Children ≤ 5 years of age seen in our emergency department for respiratory symptoms from September 1998 to May 2008 were eligible for enrollment. Nasopharyngeal wash samples were collected from all eligible patients, and clinical data were recorded. Individuals were included in this study if nasopharyngeal wash samples were positive for RSV only. Patients enrolled in the study were stratified by disease severity, defined as mild (not hospitalized), moderate (hospitalized) or severe (requiring intensive care unit stay). Concentrations of individual inflammatory biomarkers in nasopharyngeal wash fluids were determined using the Luminex human 30-plex assay. RESULTS Eight hundred fifty-one patients met study criteria: 268 (31.5%) with mild, 503 (59.1%) with moderate and 80 (9.4%) with severe illness. As expected, illness severity was directly associated with young age, prematurity, heart or lung disease, infection with RSV group A and elevated concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, CXCL8, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-α, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL2. In addition, we report several novel and mechanistically important inflammatory biomarkers of severe RSV disease, including IL-1β, IL1-RA, IL-7, epidermal growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor. CONCLUSIONS In a large, longitudinal study (10 years, 851 enrolled patients) limited to RSV infection only, in which well-known risk factors are confirmed, we identified 5 novel biomarkers specifically of severe disease. These markers may ultimately serve to elucidate disease mechanisms.","Tabarani, Christy M; Bonville, Cynthia A; Suryadevara, Manika; Branigan, Patrick; Wang, Dongliang; Huang, Danning; Rosenberg, Helene F; Domachowske, Joseph B",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e3182a14407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23804121/,295

149729,Covid-19: concerns grow over inflammatory syndrome emerging in children.,2020-04-28,"Glucosinolates (GSs) are sulfur-containing secondary metabolites characteristic of cruciferous plants [1, 2]. Their breakdown products, isothiocyanates (ITCs), are released following tissue disruption by insect feeding or other mechanical damages [3, 4]. ITCs repel and are toxic to generalist herbivores, while specialist herbivores utilize the volatile ITCs as key signals for localizing host plants [5, 6]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying detection of ITCs remain open. Here, we report that in the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella, a crucifer specialist, ITCs indeed drive the host preference for Arabidopsis thaliana, and the two olfactory receptors Or35 and Or49 are essential for this behavior. By performing gene expression analyses, we identified 12 (out of 59 in total) female-biased Ors, suggesting their possible involvement in oviposition choice. By ectopically expressing these Ors in Xenopus oocytes and screening their responses with 49 odors (including 13 ITCs, 25 general plant volatiles, and 11 sex pheromone components), we found that Or35 and Or49 responded specifically to three ITCs (iberverin, 4-pentenyl ITC, and phenylethyl ITC). The same ITCs also exhibited highest activity in electroantennogram recordings with female antennae and were the strongest oviposition stimulants. Knocking out either Or35 or Or49 via CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in a reduced oviposition preference for the ITCs, while double Or knockout females lost their ITC preference completely and were unable to choose between wild-type A. thaliana and a conspecific ITC knockout plant. We hence conclude that the ITC-based oviposition preference of the diamondback moth for its host A. thaliana is governed by the cooperation of two highly specific olfactory receptors.","Liu, Xiao-Long; Zhang, Jin; Yan, Qi; Miao, Chun-Li; Han, Wei-Kang; Hou, Wen; Yang, Ke; Hansson, Bill S; Peng, Ying-Chuan; Guo, Jin-Meng; Xu, Hao; Wang, Chen-Zhu; Dong, Shuang-Lin; Knaden, Markus",Current biology : CB,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.08.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916118/,295

We describe here a case of what we believe is the oldest (a 70-year-old) JW candidate to undergo a deceased donor kidney transplant reported in the literature. Prior to transplantation, discussions ensued amongst the multidisciplinary transplant team, weighing the potential benefits vs. risks of performing a kidney transplant on this patient due to her refusal (due to religion) to accept any blood transfusions or blood products combined with her advanced age and having longstanding insulin-dependent, type 2 diabetes mellitus with extensive peripheral vascular disease. Preoperatively, we believed that the odds were in favor of performing the kidney transplant safely without the need for any blood product usage. However, her post-operative course was complicated by severe anemia, which developed by post-transplant day 4. The anemia incapacitated the patient's physical and psychological state, creating medical, social and financial burdens on the patient, family, medical team and hospital. Both family and patient grew concerned about her overall condition. Blood transfusion was offered in order to improve her weakness and shortness of breath that developed due to the severe anemia, but the patient (along with her family) refused such treatment. During the 17 days of hospitalization, it was a continuous struggle between the transplant team, patient, and family for her to continue with the recovery process; at times we had even considered that performing the transplant had been a mistake. While organ transplantation can be performed safely in Jehovah's Witnesses, there are multiple factors seen in this particular case that warrant analyzing: (I) the potential use of stricter transplant exclusionary criteria, given the recipient's advanced age and preexisting co-morbidities, which likely increased her risk of developing severe anemia post-operatively, and (II) the recipient's emotional/psychological post-operative state of high anxiety, which developed while she was experiencing the severe anemia; in hindsight, her anxiety level may have been reduced if we had offered daily post-operative psychological counseling sessions. While the patient's allograft is currently doing well, we probably did not have strict enough criteria for proper selection of a JW candidate for kidney transplantation.","Guerra, Giselle; Ortigosa-Goggins, Mariella; Gaynor, Jeffrey J; Ciancio, Gaetano",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33178781/,295

Yet there has been relatively little discussion of how the new emergency framing might shape broader governance and policy. In this advanced review, we critically review and synthesize existing literature on crisis and emergency to inform our understanding of how this new shift might affect governance and policy. Specifically, we explore the literature on crisis governance and policy to argue that there is no simple answer to whether the ""climate emergency"" framing will be supportive of climate governance and policy;rather, more work needs to be done to understand how different political actors respond according to their perceptions, interests and values. To assist this endeavor, we develop a typology of four policy pathways, ranging from ""no emergency,"" to ""no emergency, but recognize risk,"" ""emergency as a threat"" and ""emergency as an opportunity."" We highlight the need to consider the effects of multiple and overlapping emergency frames, using the example of the intersection of climate change and COVID-19.

The Federal Government of Nigeria on March 27, 2020, imposed a total lockdown in Lagos state in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The restriction in movement prevented many patients from attending their regular clinics and physical consultations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use and effectiveness of telemedicine among the hospital health professionals during the lockdown period. Methods: This was an online cross-sectional study among doctors at a tertiary health facility in Lagos. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional ethical committee. A list of the telephone and WhatsApp contacts of doctors were obtained from the hospital directory;the SurveyMonkey tool was used as an online web-based structured questionnaire for data collection. The information obtained was analyzed to find means and averages. Results: A total of 104 doctors completed the survey. The proportion of participants who used telemedicine was 93.3%, with the most commonly used telemedicine option being phone call (27.1%) and WhatsApp video call (27.1%). The main management provided during this period was counseling (56.6%). Seventy-nine percent of the participants were satisfied with the result of the management provided through telemedicine options, but the major concern was that of ethical issues (36.2%). Majority (44.2%) of the respondents agree that telemedicine was effective during the COVID-19 lockdown period. There was no association found between gender, age, designation, and perceived effectiveness of telemedicine by respondents in this study (P = 0.88, 0.4, and 0.07, respectively). Conclusion: Telemedicine was found to be a useful tool for effective patient's management during the lockdown period although there exist ethical concerns.

However, decision-making guidance is insufficient and knowledge of factors associated with DRPD is limited. We examined biopsychosocial factors associated with CIPN-related DR/PD in women undergoing taxane-based chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer. Patients and methods: As part of a longitudinal study of CIPN measurement, women completed assessments before the first taxane infusion and at the final infusion or within the originally expected timeframe for the final infusion. Participants completed self-report measures of CIPN, pain, and physical and psychosocial wellbeing, and underwent physical testing of lower limb disability and Quantitative Sensory Testing for sensation and pain threshold to thermal, vibration, and touch stimuli in the feet and hands. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with neuropathy-related DRPD. Results: Among 121 participants, 66 (54.5%) received taxane-as-prescribed, 46 (38.0%) had neuropathy-related DRPD, and 9 (7.4%) had DR/PD for other reasons. Factors associated with neuropathy-related DR/PD were receipt of paclitaxel (Odds Ratio [OR]=75.05, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.56-2197.96]), lower pre-treatment pain catastrophizing (OR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.95), and higher post-treatment neuropathic pain (OR=10.77, 95% CI: 1.99-58.15) and sensitivity to cold pain in the hand (OR=1.64, 95% CI: 1.05-2.56). Conclusion: CIPN-related DRPD is associated with paclitaxel treatment and post-treatment neuropathic pain and cold pain sensitivity in the hands. CIPN communication to healthcare providers may be influenced by pain catastrophizing, suggesting symptom appraisal may be an important factor in communication.

One way of mitigating the economic imbalances that seasonality can cause is to find strategies for seasonal adjustment, such as travel programmes aimed at the elderly. This paper analyses the seasonality of tourism activity in some EU countries, and in particular in Spain. Different indicators are used to compare the results and carry out a sensitivity analysis. The study then focuses on tourism programmes for the elderly in Spain to see whether this type of programme helps to alleviate the seasonality of tourism activity. To corroborate this, an econometric model is specified and estimated, which enables the scope of these programmes to be compared.","Paz, Rico Cabrer-Borrás Bernardí Morillas-Jurado Francisco",Mathematics,https://doi.org/10.3390/math9162003,295

Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) myofibroblasts are the primary cell type responsible for liver fibrosis, yet there are currently no therapies directed at inhibiting the activity of HSC myofibroblasts. To search for potential anti-fibrotic drugs, we performed a high-throughput compound screen in primary human HSC myofibroblasts and identified 19 small molecules that induce HSC inactivation, including the polyether ionophore nanchangmycin (NCMC). NCMC induces lipid re-accumulation while reducing collagen expression, deposition of collagen in the extracellular matrix, cell proliferation, and migration. We find that NCMC increases cytosolic Ca2+ and reduces the phosphorylated protein levels of FYN, FAK, ERK1/2, HSP27 and STAT5B. Further, depletion of each of these kinases suppress COL1A1 expression. These studies reveal a signaling network triggered by NCMC to inactivate HSC myofibroblasts and reduce expression of proteins that compose the fibrotic scar. The identification of the antifibrotic effects of NCMC and the pathways by which NCMC inhibits fibrosis provides new tools and therapeutic targets to combat the development and progression of liver fibrosis.","Li, Wenyang; Chen, Jennifer Y.; Sun, Cheng; Sparks, Robert P.; Pantano, Lorena; Rahman, Raza-Ur; Moran, Sean P.; Pondick, Joshua V.; Kirchner, Rory; Wrobel, David; Bieler, Michael; Ho Sui, Shannan J.; Doerner, Julia F.; Rippmann, Jörg F.; Mullen, Alan C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.08.463221,295

In response to the growing need, food banks and soup kitchens across New York City have adapted by distributing free food boxes in high-need communities. While program evaluations have largely focused on distribution, no study has assessed the consumption of the contents of these boxes and their impact on increasing nutrition. This study aimed to evaluate the consumption and nutritional impact of food boxes provided by World Central Kitchen on recipients in New York City. A study of 391 food box recipients was conducted across 4 New York City boroughs from July 13-September 18, 2020. Key informants identified communities with high food insecurity. A phone survey was conducted by WCK staff to participants waiting in line to receive a food box. Boxes contained either fresh fruits and vegetables only or fresh produce and dairy. Contents were included because of their nutritional values. Survey responses were imported into a data frame and analyzed to understand consumption and nutritional impact of food boxes. Variables of interest included: demographics, household size, if they were the primary cook in their home, most and least preferred item(s) in the box, items they wished were included, quantity of the box consumed, and reason for unused items. Of the 391 survey participants, the contents of the food boxes reached 1,398 individuals. Moreover, 90% of participants consumed all of the box's contents, increasing their nutrition. The high percentage of WCK food boxes completely consumed suggests that boxes offering fruits and vegetables are an effective intervention in improving nutrition for recipients. These findings have important implications for shaping nutritional guidance of future food box programs. None.

Compounds with antiviral activity were recently identified that bind to the N-terminal domain of CA (CA N) and inhibit capsid assembly during viral maturation. We have determined the structure of the complex between CA N and the antiviral assembly inhibitor N-(3-chloro-4-methylphenyl)-N'-{2-[({5-[(dimethylamino)-methyl]-2-furyl}-methyl)-sulfanyl]ethyl}-urea) (CAP-1) using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The protein undergoes a remarkable conformational change upon CAP-1 binding, in which Phe32 is displaced from its buried position in the protein core to open a deep hydrophobic cavity that serves as the ligand binding site. The aromatic ring of CAP-1 inserts into the cavity, with the urea NH groups forming hydrogen bonds with the backbone oxygen of Val59 and the dimethylamonium group interacting with the side-chains of Glu28 and Glu29.

191535,Riverside Medical Group's Response to Coping and Caring During COVID-19.,2020,"Retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE cells) are key players in the first-line defense against invading organisms such as viruses and bacteria. The interaction between RPE cells and viral or bacterial components is very important for clearance of these organisms. Toll-like receptors are a family of recognition receptors involved in innate immunity. Each TLR acts as a primary sensor of conserved microbial components and drives the induction of specific biological responses. TLR 3 is involved in the recognition of viral components, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and poly(I:C), while TLR 9 recognizes viral or bacterial DNA without methylation at CpG motifs. In the present study, we investigated the expression and function of TLR 3 and 9 in RPE cells. PCR analysis revealed expression of genes for TLR 3 and 9 in RPE cells. Expression of TLR 3 and 9 protein was detected in RPE cells by flow cytometry. TLR 3 and 9 showed strong intracellular expression. To detect angiogenetic factors produced by RPE cells, culture supernatant was examined with the Human Angiogenesis Antibody Array, which can simultaneously detect 20 different angiogenetic factors including cytokines, chemokines, soluble cytokine receptors, and growth factors. RPE cells showed high production of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemotactic protein-I (MCP-I). Furthermore, stimulation of RPE cells with the dsRNA analogue poly(I:C) enhanced the secretion of IL-8 and MCP-I, as well as enhancing the expression of junctional adhesion molecule-I (Jam-I) and intracellular adhesion molecule-I (ICAM-I), and promoted the adhesion of monocyte to these cells. In contrast, stimulation with the CpG-DNA motif only enhanced the secretion of IL-8. However, CpG-DNA motif enhanced phagocytosis in RPE cells. These results may indicate that TLR 3 and 9 play a distinct role in the inflammatory response that clears viruses from the retina.","Ebihara, Nobuyuki; Chen, Lizhong; Tokura, Tomoko; Ushio, Hiroko; Iwatsu, Minoru; Murakami, Akira",Ophthalmic research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17534115/,295

As a preventive measure, a department of obstetrics and gynecology in Israel constructed a separate, designated complex for its COVID-19-exposed patients. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic infection control measures on obstetric care in the obstetrical emergency department and delivery unit. METHODS The authors collected data retrospectively from February 2020 to March 2020 and compared it to data of a parallel period in 2019. RESULTS From 1 February 2020 to 28 March 2020, 3897 women were referred to the emergency department (ED), compared to 4067 the previous year. Mean duration of treatment until decision and referral indications did not differ between 2020 and 2019 (207 vs. 220 minutes, P = 0.26; urgent referrals 58.8% vs. 59.2%, P = 0.83). A per-week comparison showed a significant reduction in ED referrals only in the last week of the period (337 [2020] vs. 515 [2019], P < 0.001). The proportion of women admitted to the delivery unit in active labor was significantly higher in the last three weeks (39.1% vs. 28.2%, P = 0.005). During February and March 2020, 1666 women delivered, compared to 1654 during February and March 2019. The proportion of types and modes of delivery did not differ. In a per-week comparison, the number of deliveries did not differ (mean 208 vs. 206, P = 0.88).

199624,A case of coronavirus disease 2019 with twice negative nucleic acid testing within 8 days,2020,"OBJECTIVE Endovascular treatment is one of the most important treatments along with open craniotomy for cerebrovascular surgery. The successful treatment of endovascular disease relies on appropriate instruments and the surgeon's skill. Endovascular treatment needs to provide safe and stable access to the catheter cavity. Additionally, it is important to maintain a round shape without changing to an oval shape. The catheter for endovascular treatment has to be flexible and accommodate at least 0.027 inches of inner diameter. The 6-Fr Navien™ Intracranial Support Catheter (formerly the ReFlex Intracranial Catheter; Covidien Vascular Therapies, Mansfield, MA, USA) provides 0.072 inches of inner diameter. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed 61 cases for 56 cases of endovascular treatment with a Navien catheter. A triaxial system was used for all procedures with femoral arterial access. The Navien catheter was placed in the petrous segment of the internal carotid artery or third segment of the vertebral artery. The patients had various shapes of intracranial arteries, including tortuous vessels. RESULTS The Navien catheter was used for 61 cases of endovascular treatment. We had 59 cases of coil embolization at unruptured and ruptured aneurysms and two cases of stent insertion into the middle cerebral artery. All the cases were successful without any catheter-related complications. CONCLUSION The Navien catheter is a recently developed catheter that has several strengths compared with previously developed catheters. It provides a more stable environment for endovascular treatment. It provides a cavity sufficient for endovascular treatment devices. Additionally, it is sufficiently flexible to approach tortuous vessels.","Lee, Siwoo; Gong, Tae-Sik; Lee, Yong-Woo; Kim, Hyo-Joon; Kweon, Chang-Young",Journal of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27847767/,295

Experimental drug screening is expensive and time consuming, and it is desirable to carry out large scale docking calculations in a high-throughput manner to narrow the experimental search space. Few of the existing computational docking tools were designed with high performance computing in mind. Therefore, optimizations to maximize use of high-performance computational resources available at leadership-class computing facilities enables these facilities to be leveraged for drug discovery. Here we present the porting, optimization, and validation of the AutoDock-GPU program for the Summit supercomputer, and its application to initial compound screening efforts to target proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","LeGrand, Scott; Scheinberg, Aaron; Tillack, Andreas F; Thavappiragasam, Mathialakan; Vermaas, Josh V; Agarwal, Rupesh; Larkin, Jeff; Poole, Duncan; Santos-Martins, Diogo; Solis-Vasquez, Leonardo; Koch, Andreas; Forli, Stefano; Hernandez, Oscar; Smith, Jeremy C; Sedova, Ada",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32676519/,295
200430,Multi-system Inflammatory syndrome in Children (MIS-C): an evolving presentation of COVID-19 in the pediatric population: A Florida State experience and our management approach,2021,"Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), a member of the Closteroviridae, has a positive-sense RNA genome of about 20 kb organized into 12 open reading frames (ORFs). The last 10 ORFs are expressed through 3'-coterminal subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) regulated in both amounts and timing. Additionally, relatively large amounts of complementary sgRNAs are produced. We have been unable to determine whether these sgRNAs are produced by internal promotion from the full-length template minus strand or by transcription from the minus-stranded sgRNAs. Understanding the regulation of 10 sgRNAs is a conceptual challenge. In analyzing commonalities of a replicase complex in producing so many sgRNAs, we examined initiating nucleotides of the sgRNAs. We mapped the 5' termini of intermediate- (CP and p13) and low- (p18) produced sgRNAs that, like the two highly abundant sgRNAs (p20 and p23) previously mapped, all initiate with an adenylate. We then examined modifications of the initiation site, which has been shown to be useful in defining mechanisms of sgRNA synthesis. Surprisingly, mutation of the initiating nucleotide of the CTV sgRNAs did not prevent sgRNA accumulation. Based on our results, the CTV replication complex appears to initiate sgRNA synthesis with purines, preferably with adenylates, and is able to initiate synthesis using a nucleotide a few positions 5' or 3' of the native initiation nucleotide. Furthermore, the context of the initiation site appears to be a regulatory mechanism for levels of sgRNA production. These data do not support either of the established mechanisms for synthesis of sgRNAs, suggesting that CTV sgRNA production utilizes a different mechanism.","Ayllón, María A; Gowda, Siddarame; Satyanarayana, Tatineni; Karasev, Alexander V; Adkins, Scott; Mawassi, Munir; Guerri, José; Moreno, Pedro; Dawson, William O",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12915539/,295

In this study, we evaluated the association between use of methylprednisolone and key clinical outcomes. METHODS: Clinical outcomes associated with the use of methylprednisolone were assessed in an unmatched, case-control study; a subset of patients also underwent propensity-score matching. Patients were admitted between March 1 and April 12, 2020. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days by 28 days after admission. Secondary outcomes included extubation, mortality, discharge, positive cultures, and hyperglycemia. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients met inclusion criteria. Propensity matching yielded a cohort of 42 well-matched pairs. Groups were similar except for hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use, which were more common in patients who did not receive methylprednisolone. Mean ventilator free-days were significantly higher in patients treated with methylprednisolone (6.21±7.45 versus 3.14±6.22; P = 0.044). The probability of extubation was also increased in patients receiving methylprednisolone (45% versus 21%; P = 0.021), and there were no significant differences in mortality (19% versus 36%; P = 0.087). In a multivariable linear regression analysis, only methylprednisolone use was associated with higher number of ventilator-free days (P = 0.045). The incidence of positive cultures and hyperglycemia were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Methylprednisolone was associated with increased ventilator-free days and higher probability of extubation in a propensity-score matched cohort. Randomized, controlled studies are needed to further define methylprednisolone use in patients with COVID-19.","Nelson, Brian C; Laracy, Justin; Shoucri, Sherif; Dietz, Donald; Zucker, Jason; Patel, Nina; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E; Kubin, Christine J; Gomez-Simmonds, Angela",Clin. infect. dis,,295

Although COVID-19 commonly affects respiratory system in the form of cough and dyspnea, a neurotropic presentation has been described in one-third of patients. Objective We report an atypical case of COVID-19 with mild symptoms who presented to our hospital with features suggestive of severe Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Discussion The mechanisms by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes neurologic damage are multifactorial, including direct damage to specific receptors, cytokine-mediated injury, secondary hypoxia, and retrograde travel along nerve fibers. The pathogenesis of GBS secondary to COVID-19 is not yet well understood. It is hypothesized that viral illnesses-related GBS could be mediated due to autoantibodies or direct neurotoxic effects of viruses. Conclusion In this ongoing era of pandemic, it is very important for the clinicians to be aware of association of GBS with COVID-19, as early diagnosis and treatment of this complication could have gratifying results. It is also very important to differentiate GBS from critical illness neuropathy and respiratory distress secondary to COVID-19 itself, as treatment to the above conditions is quite different and inability to correctly diagnose could lead to significant increase in morbidity and mortality.","Behera, D.; Behera, R.

PURPOSE: To establish if complementary CT chest was performed as recommended, and if CT chest influenced surgical intervention decision. To assess detection rate of COVID-19 on CT and its correlation with RT-PCR swab results. To determine if COVID-19 changes is reliably detected within the lung bases which are usually imaged in standard abdominal CT. METHODS: Patients with acute abdominal symptoms presenting to a single institution between 1st and 30th April 2020 who had abdominal CT and complementary CT chest were retrospectively extracted from Computerised Radiology Information System. CT COVID-19 changes were categorised according to British Society of Thoracic Radiology reporting guidance. Patient demographics (age and gender), RT-PCR swab results and management pathway (conservative or intervention) were recorded from electronic patient records. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate any significant association between variables. p values &#8804;0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. RESULTS: Compliancy rate in performing complementary CT chest was 92.5% (148/160). Thirty-five patients (35/148,23.6%) underwent intervention during admission. There was no significant association (p = 0.9085) between acquisition of CT chest and management pathway (conservative vs intervention). CT chest had 57% sensitivity (CI 18.41% to 90.1%) and 100% specificity (CI 92% to 100%) in COVID-19 diagnosis.

The current study aimed to provide policymakers, academics, and researchers with a snapshot of global SDGs-related research activity. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional descriptive bibliometric study. SciVerse Scopus was used to retrieve SDGs-related research publications for the period from 2015 to 2019. RESULTS: In total, 18,696 documents were found. The Sustainability journal ranked first (n = 1008; 5.4%) in the number of SDGs-related publications. The World Health Organization was the most active institution in publishing SDGs-related documents (n = 581; 1.3%). Most of the retrieved documents belonged to SDG 17 (partnership) followed by SDG 13 (climate action), and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), while SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) had the least number of publications. The European region (n = 9756; 52.2%) had the highest research contribution while the Eastern Mediterranean region (n = 1052; 5.6%) had the least contribution. After exclusion of SDG 17, the SDG 3 (good health and well-being) was the top researched SDG for the African region, the Eastern Mediterranean regions, and the South-Eastern Asian region. For the region of the Americas, European region, and the Western Pacific region, the SDG 13 (climate action) was the most researched. The SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) was the least researched in the African region, the region of the Americas, the European region, and the South-East Asian region. In the Eastern Mediterranean region, SDG 10 (reduced inequality) was the least researched while in the Western Pacific region, SDG 5 (gender inequality) was the least researched. The most researched targets of SDG 3 were targets 7 (sexual and reproductive health services) and 8 (universal health coverage) while the least researched targets were 5 (substance use disorders) and 9 (death from hazardous materials). International research collaboration within SDG 3 between high- and low-income countries was inadequate. CONCLUSION: The analysis presented in the current study are useful for researchers, institutes, governments, funding agencies, and policy-makers. Countries in Africa, the Middle East, and South-East Asia need to increase their funding and research collaboration in the field of SDGs.","Sweileh, Waleed M",Global Health,,295
221796,Coronavirus disease 2019–related Kawasaki-like disease in an adult: A case report,2020,"Background: Phenotypes have been identified within heterogeneous disease, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, which are associated with important prognostic and therapeutic implications. The present study sought to assess whether phenotypes can be derived from intensive care patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to assess the correlation with prognosis, and to develop a parsimonious model for phenotype identification. Methods: Adult patients with COVID-19 from Tongji hospital between January 2020 and March 2020 were included. The consensus k means clustering and latent class analysis (LCA) were applied to identify phenotypes using 26 clinical variables. We then employed machine learning algorithms to select a maximum of five important classifier variables, which were further used to establish a nested logistic regression model for phenotype identification. Results: Both consensus k means clustering and LCA showed that a two-phenotype model was the best fit for the present cohort (N = 504). A total of 182 patients (36.1%) were classified as hyperactive phenotype, who exhibited a higher 28-day mortality and higher rates of organ dysfunction than did those in hypoactive phenotype. The top five variables used to assign phenotypes were neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), ratio of pulse oxygen saturation to the fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (Spo2/Fio2) ratio, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and urea nitrogen. From the nested logistic models, three-variable (NLR, Spo2/Fio2 ratio, and LDH) and four-variable (three-variable plus TNF-α) models were adjudicated to be the best performing, with the area under the curve of 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94–0.97] and 0.97 (95% CI = 0.96–0.98), respectively. Conclusion: We identified two phenotypes within COVID-19, with different host responses and outcomes. The phenotypes can be accurately identified with parsimonious classifier models using three or four variables.","Chen, H.; Zhu, Z.; Su, N.; Wang, J.; Gu, J.; Lu, S.; Zhang, L.; Chen, X.; Xu, L.; Shao, X.; Yin, J.; Yang, J.; Sun, B.; Li, Y.",Frontiers in Medicine,,295

223635,The dual pandemics of COVID-19 and racism: impact on early childhood development and implications for physicians,2020,"The mental and physical effects of repeated lockdowns are unknown. We conducted a longitudinal study of the influence of repeated mild lockdowns during two emergency declarations in Japan, in May 2020 and February 2021. The analyses included 7,893 people who participated in all online surveys. During repeated mild lockdowns, mental and physical symptoms decreased overall, while loneliness increased and social networks decreased. Subgroup analyses revealed that depression and suicidal ideation did not decrease only in the younger age group (aged 18-29) and that younger and middle-aged people (aged 18-49), women, people with a history of treatment for mental illness, and people who were socially disadvantaged in terms of income had higher levels of mental and physical symptoms at all survey times. Additionally, comprehensive extraction of the interaction structure between depression, demographic attributes, and psychosocial variables indicated that loneliness and social networks were most closely associated with depression. These results indicate that repeated lockdowns have cumulative negative effects on interpersonal interaction and loneliness and that susceptible populations, such as young people and those with high levels of loneliness, require special consideration during repetitive lockdown situations.","Yamamoto, Tetsuya; Uchiumi, Chigusa; Suzuki, Naho; Sugaya, Nagisa; Murillo-Rodriguez, Eric; Machado, Srgio; Imperatori, Claudio; Budde, Henning",,,295

Patients and Methods: Age-adjusted race-stratified prevalence of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity), preexisting medical conditions (pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, malignancy), poor health behaviors (smoking, alcohol abuse, physical inactivity), and adverse socioeconomic factors (education, household income, health insurance) was computed in 435,139 American adult participants from 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey (BRFSS). Correlation was assessed between health determinants and the race-stratified COVID-19 crude mortality and infection-fatality-ratio computed from respective state public health departments in 47 states. Results: Blacks had a higher prevalence of comorbidities (63.3% [95%CI:62.4-64.2%] vs. 55.1% [95%CI:54.7-55.5]) and adverse socioeconomic factors (47.0% [95%CI:46.0-47.9%] vs. 30.9% [95%CI:30.6-31.3]) than Whites. The prevalence of preexisting medical conditions was similar among Blacks (30.4% [95%CI:28.8-32.1%]) and Whites (30.8% [95%CI:30.2-31.4%]). The prevalence of poor health behaviors was higher in Whites (57.2% [95%CI:56.3-58.0%]) than Blacks (50.2% [95%CI:46.2-54.2%]). The comorbidities and adverse socioeconomic factors were highest in the Southern region, and poor health behaviors were highest in the Western region. Cumulative incidence rate (per 100,000 persons) was three-fold higher in Blacks (1546.4) compared withwith Whites (540.4). The crude mortality (per 100,000 persons) was two-fold higher in Blacks (83.2) than Whites (33.2). However, the infection-fatality-ratio (per 100-cases) was similar between Whites (6.2) and Blacks (5.4). Within racial groups, the geographic distribution of health determinants did not correlate with state-level COVID-19 mortality and infection-fatality ratio (p>0.05 for all). Conclusions: Racial disparities in COVID-19 are largely driven by the higher cumulative incidence of infection in Blacks. There is a discordance between the geographic dispersion of COVID-19 mortality and the regional distribution of health determinants.","Parcha, Vibhu; Malla, Gargya; Suri, Sarabjeet S; Kalra, Rajat; Heindl, Brittain; Berra, Lorenzo; Fouad, Mona N; Arora, Garima; Arora, Pankaj",,,295
224886,Spontaneous Brainstem Hemorrhagic Stroke in the Setting of Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 - A Case Report,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated an abrupt transition to remote delivery of psychology services at a time when patients and practicing clinicians are experiencing an increase in life stressors (e.g., job loss, social isolation, need to adapt to telehealth practice), which can exacerbate mental health concerns and contribute to clinician burnout. Because the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting diverse individuals in myriad ways, these circumstances can elicit a wide range of emotions and emotional responses. Thus, treatment during this time must be able to address heterogeneous presenting problems while placing minimal burden on clinicians who are adjusting to continuously changing circumstances. Transdiagnostic, emotion-focused, cognitive behavioral treatments (CBT), such as the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP), may be particularly well suited to address the challenges faced by practicing psychologists, and their patients, in the current COVID-19 pandemic. This paper discusses the applicability and adaptability of transdiagnostic treatments to telehealth, focusing primarily on the UP in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, while many CBT skills (e.g., mindfulness) can be easily translated to tele-delivery, other skills, such as exposure, can be more difficult to implement remotely, especially in the midst of a pandemic. Thus, this paper also provides practical suggestions for clinicians with regard to implementing the UP remotely.","Cassiello-Robbins, Clair; Zachary Rosenthal, M; Ammirati, Rachel J",,,295

This cross-sectional online survey conducted among the Indian population employed a convenient snowball sampling technique. Age, gender, marital status, educational qualifications, health care worker status and state of residence were the demographic details (six items) collected. The seven-item FCV-19S was used to assess fear regarding COVID-19 on a five-point Likert scale. The mean score for the responses was calculated and compared based on demographic variables. A comparison of low and high levels of fear and a multiple logistic regression analysis of levels of fear with demographic variables were conducted. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study population comprised 45.6% (683) males and 54.4% (816) females, with approximately 68% belonging to the age group of 20-40 years. The overall mean score for the questionnaire was 18.00 + 5.68. A significantly higher number of the study population reported low fear (54.8%). Only gender (p = 0.08) and health care worker status (p = 0.02) revealed a significant difference based on the level of fear. Females, married status, lower educational status and being a health care worker displayed significantly higher odds for high level of fear compared to their respective counterparts in this study population. The findings of this study may help to identify the groups most at risk and formulate tailor-made intervention strategies to ensure their optimal health in this time of global crisis.","Doshi, Dolar; Karunakar, Parupalli; Sukhabogi, Jagadeeswara Rao; Prasanna, Jammula Surya; Mahajan, Sheshadri Vishnu",Int J Ment Health Addict,,295

To understand how to prevent and mitigate future outbreaks, it is imperative that we understand which nursing homes are more likely to experience COVID-19 cases. Our aim was to examine the characteristics of nursing homes with documented COVID-19 cases in the 30 states reporting the individual facilities affected. DESIGN: We constructed a database of nursing homes with verified COVID-19 cases as of May 11, 2020, via correspondence with and publicly available reports from state departments of health. We linked this information to nursing home characteristics and used regression analysis to examine the association between these characteristics and the likelihood of having a documented COVID-19 case. SETTING: All nursing homes from 30 states that reported COVID-19 cases at the facility-level. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents in states reporting data. MEASUREMENTS: Whether a nursing home had a reported COVID-19 case (yes/no), and conditional on having a case, the number of cases at a nursing home. RESULTS: Of 9,395 nursing homes in our sample, 2,949 (31.4%) had a documented COVID-19 case. Larger facility size, urban location, greater percentage of African American residents, non-chain status, and state were significantly (P < .05) related to the increased probability of having a COVID-19 case. Five-star rating, prior infection violation, Medicaid dependency, and ownership were not significantly related. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 cases in nursing homes are related to facility location and size and not traditional quality metrics such as star rating and prior infection control citations.

Int J Infect Dis. 2020 September",2020,"Many practical graph problems, such as knowledge graph construction and drug-to-drug interaction, require to handle multi-relational graphs. However, handling real-world multi-label graphs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is often challenging due to their evolving nature, where new entities (nodes) can emerge over time. Moreover, newly emerged entities often have few links, which makes the learning even more difficult. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce a realistic problem of few-shot out-of-graph link prediction, where we not only predict the links between the seen and unseen nodes as in a conventional out-of-knowledge link prediction but also between the unseen nodes, with only few edges per node. We tackle this problem with a novel transductive meta-learning framework which we refer to as Graph Extrapolation Networks (GEN). GEN meta-learns both the node embedding network for inductive inference (seen-to-unseen) and the link prediction network for transductive inference (unseen-to-unseen). For transductive link prediction, we further propose a stochastic embedding layer to model uncertainty in the link prediction between unseen entities. We validate our model on multiple benchmark datasets for knowledge graph link prediction and drug-to-drug interaction prediction. The results show that our model significantly outperforms relevant baselines for out-of-graph link prediction tasks.","Baek, Jinheon; Lee, Dong Bok; Hwang, Sung Ju",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06648v1.pdf,295

231947,Could renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors be used for hypertensive patients with coronavirus disease 2019?,2020,"Red cell transfusion represents one of the cornerstones of the chronic management of sickle cell disease, as well as its acute complications. Automated red cell exchange can rapidly lower the number of circulating sickle erythrocytes, without causing iron overload. Here, we describe our experience, having offered this intervention since 2011. A transient reduction in the platelet count by 61% was observed after the procedure. This was not associated with any haemorrhagic complications. Despite exposure to large volumes of blood, the alloimmunisation rate was only 0.027/100 units of red cells. The absence of any iron loading was confirmed by serial Ferriscans, performed over a number of years. However, patients with advanced chronic kidney disease showed evidence of iron loading due to reduced innate haemopoiesis and were subsequently switched to simple transfusions. A total of 59% of patients were on regular automated red cell exchange with a history of recurrent painful crises. A total of 77% responded clinically, as evidenced by at least a 25% reduction in their emergency hospital attendance for pain management. The clinical response was gradual and increased the longer patients stayed on the program. The earliest sign of clinical response was a reduction in the length of stay when these patients were hospitalised, indicating that a reduction in the severity of crises precedes the reduction in their frequency. Automated red cell exchange also appeared to be beneficial for patients with recurrent leg ulcers and severe, drug resistant stuttering priapism, while patients with pulmonary hypertension showed a dramatic improvement in their symptoms as well as echocardiographic parameters.","Tsitsikas, Dimitris A; Badle, Saket; Hall, Rhys; Meenan, John; Bello-Sanyaolu, Oloruntoyin; Orebayo, Funmilayo; Abukar, Jibril; Elmi, Mohamed; Mulla, Afsana; Dave, Shalini; Lewis, Natasha; Sharma, Manisha; Chatterjee, Basabi; Amos, Roger J",,,295

While safe vaccines were developed, tested and approved at an extraordinary pace, concerns were raised regarding the public's response in accepting the vaccine on the population level. Israel was among the first countries to roll out a massive national campaign for COVID-19 vaccination, positioning Israel as the global lead in vaccine uptake. Priority for vaccination was given to high-risk groups: older and middle-age adults, healthcare workers, senior home residents and caregivers, people with chronic conditions, followed by teachers and soldiers. Contributing to the success of the operation thus far has been a systems approach beyond nationwide accessibility: building public trust through an integrated and familiar health system, a familiar technology (vaccine), transparency regarding vaccine safety information, culturally appropriate messages in digital and offline media, acknowledging diverse health literacy needs, and active participation and role-modeling by political/religious opinion leaders. Vaccine resistance and hesitancy may be encountered as the campaign progresses, and younger groups targeted. Future considerations include perceived benefits offered to people with vaccination and the role of health/digital literacy in preparedness policies.

At the height of the pandemic, there were 855 patients with COVID-19 admitted on April 13, 2020. Due to high demand for dialysis and shortages of staff and supplies, we started an urgent peritoneal dialysis (PD) program. From April 1 to April 22, a total of 30 patients were started on PD. Of those 30 patients, 14 died during their hospitalization, 8 were discharged, and 8 were still hospitalized as of May 14, 2020. Although the PD program was successful in its ability to provide much-needed kidney replacement therapy when hemodialysis was not available, challenges to delivering adequate PD dosage included difficulties providing nurse training and availability of supplies. Providing adequate clearance and ultrafiltration for patients in intensive care units was especially difficult due to the high prevalence of a hypercatabolic state, volume overload, and prone positioning. PD was more easily performed in non-critically ill patients outside the intensive care unit. Despite these challenges, we demonstrate that urgent PD is a feasible alternative to hemodialysis in situations with critical resource shortages.","Sourial, Maryanne Y; Sourial, Mina H; Dalsan, Rochelle; Graham, Jay; Ross, Michael; Chen, Wei; Golestaneh, Ladan",Am J Kidney Dis,,295

Using a purpose-designed analysis framework and scoring scheme, we analyzed standards of accreditation and practice for 29 regulated, self-regulated and member health professions in Australia to determine the extent and accountability of statements related to interprofessional education and interprofessional collaborative practice. Currently, in Australia, there is a fragmented and inconsistent approach to interprofessional education and interprofessional collaboration evident in accreditation and practice standards and, in general, there are more explicit requirements in standards of the regulated health professions. However, overall the concepts of interprofessional education and interprofessional practice are ill-defined and statements lack accountability and/or outcome measures.

So, we compared antibody results of eight kinds of commercial immunoassays using clinical remnant specimens. METHODS: We compared the results of several immunoassay kits tested on 40 serum samples from 15 confirmed patients and 86 remnant serum samples from clinical laboratory. Eight kinds of IVD kits-four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, two lateral flow rapid immunochromatographic assays, and two chemiluminescent immunoassays with one RUO kit were tested. RESULTS: Among 40 serum samples from 15 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, 35 yielded at least one positive result for detecting antibodies in the combined assessment. There were inconsistent results in 12 (28%) samples by single immunoassay. Forty samples collected in 2019 before the first COVID-19 Korean case showed negative results except for one equivocal result. CONCLUSION: The discrepant results obtained with different immunoassay kits in this study show that serological assessment of SARS-CoV-2 by a single immunoassay requires caution not only in detecting infection but also in assessing immunologic status.","Lee, Sun Min; Kim, In Suk; Lim, Seungjin; Lee, Su Jin; Kim, Won Joo; Shin, Kyung Hwa; Moon, Soo Young; Chang, Chulhun L",J Korean Med Sci,,295

Super-resolution (SR), in the past few years, has produced remarkable results using deep learning methods. The ability of deep learning methods to learn the non-linear mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to their corresponding high-resolution (HR) images leads to compelling results for SR in diverse areas of research. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based image super-resolution architecture in Tchebichef transform domain. This is achieved by integrating a transform layer into the proposed architecture through a customized Tchebichef convolutional layer ($TCL$). The role of TCL is to convert the LR image from the spatial domain to the orthogonal transform domain using Tchebichef basis functions. The inversion of the aforementioned transformation is achieved using another layer known as the Inverse Tchebichef convolutional Layer (ITCL), which converts back the LR images from the transform domain to the spatial domain. It has been observed that using the Tchebichef transform domain for the task of SR takes the advantage of high and low-frequency representation of images that makes the task of super-resolution simplified. We, further, introduce transfer learning approach to enhance the quality of Covid based medical images. It is shown that our architecture enhances the quality of X-ray and CT images of COVID-19, providing a better image quality that helps in clinical diagnosis. Experimental results obtained using the proposed Tchebichef transform domain super-resolution (TTDSR) architecture provides competitive results when compared with most of the deep learning methods employed using a fewer number of trainable parameters.","Kumar, Ahlad; Singh, Harsh Vardhan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10640v2.pdf,295

It is unclear if this discrepancy is due to differences in associated diagnoses. This study aimed to analyze the incidence of pediatric tracheostomy in the United States from 2003 to 2016 and to determine the odds of placement among Black children when compared with other children. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: Academic hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We used the 2003 to 2016 Kid Inpatient Database to determine the incidence of pediatric tracheostomy in the United States and determine the odds of tracheostomy placement in Black children when compared with other children. RESULTS: A total of 26,034 pediatric tracheostomies were performed between 2003 and 2016, among which, 21% were Black children. The median age was 7 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 0 to 17); 43% were &#8804;2 years old, and 62% were male. The most common principal diagnosis was respiratory failure (72%). When compared with other children, Black children were more likely to undergo tracheostomy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3), which increased among children younger than 2 years old (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4-1.5). Black children with tracheostomies were also more likely to be diagnosed with laryngeal stenosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia and to have an extended length of stay (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Black children are 1.2 times more likely to undergo tracheostomy in the United States compared with other children. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate if there are underlying anatomical, environmental, or psychosocial factors that contribute to this discrepancy.","Brown, Clarice; Shah, Gopi B; Mitchell, Ron B; Lenes-Voit, Felicity; Johnson, Romaine F",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,295

We, therefore, developed a mini-program within the app WeChat. This analyzes data from all users and traces close contacts of all patients. This permits early tracing and quarantine of potential sources of infection. Data from the mini-program can also be merged with other data to predict epidemic trends, calculate individual and population risks, and provide recommendations for individual and population protection action.

Obese patients tended to have symptoms of cough (P = 0.03) and fever (P = 0.06) compared with patients who were not obese. Compared with normal weight patients, those who were overweight had 1.84-fold odds of developing severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.84, 95% CI 0.99-3.43, P = 0.05), while those who were obese were at 3.40-fold odds of developing severe disease (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.40-2.86, P = 0.007), after adjusting for age, sex, epidemiological characteristics, days from disease onset to hospitalization, presence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and cancer, and drug used for treatment. Additionally, after similar adjustment, men who were obese versus those who were normal weight were at increased odds of developing severe COVID-19 (OR 5.66, 95% CI 1.80-17.75, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, obese patients had increased odds of progressing to severe COVID-19. As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may continue to spread worldwide, clinicians should pay close attention to obese patients, who should be carefully managed with prompt and aggressive treatment.","Cai, Qingxian; Chen, Fengjuan; Wang, Tao; Luo, Fang; Liu, Xiaohui; Wu, Qikai; He, Qing; Wang, Zhaoqin; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei; Chen, Jun; Xu, Lin",Diabetes Care,,295
267926,Possible affective cognitive cerebellar syndrome in a young patient with COVID-19 CNS vasculopathy and stroke,2020,"Background: SARS-Cov-2 infects not only adults, but also children, including pediatric surgery patients with acute abdomen Here, we report a pediatric surgery case with incarcerated inguinal hernia and suspected COVID-19 Case presentation: A 11-month-old male was brought to our emergency department with the main complaint of recurrent yellowish-green vomiting that was experienced from one day before admission High fever and shortness of breath were also reported This patient was also suffering from moderate dehydration Neither history of contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 nor traveling from any local transmission area were found However, a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody test revealed a positive result A lump in the left scrotum that persisted during admission was found Fluid resuscitation and nasogastric tube placement for decompression was performed Manual reduction was attempted but failed to reduce the lump Accordingly, we decided to perform an emergency high ligation using tertiary protection regulations, i e , full personal protective equipment (PPE) for COVID-19 Intraoperatively, we found a small intestine loop trapped in the scrotum and stuck in the inguinal canal Postoperatively, the baby was continued to be managed as a patient with COVID-19 while waiting for the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results Discussion: Manual reduction is standard treatment for incarcerated inguinal hernia in children The successful rate of manual reduction is about 70%, therefore, if the manual reduction fails, an emergency surgery is mandatory During the COVID-19 pandemic, all medical procedures require clarity of the patient's status including whether infected with COVID-19 Along with proper precautions, great care must be taken during surgery to minimize the risk of cross infection to health workers Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgeons should always be aware of the possibility of cross-transmission from the patient, since children are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection When and wherever possible, surgeons should perform the procedure in the quickest and most effective manner to shorten exposure time with patient and anesthetic aerosols as well as using appropriate PPE","Gunadi, Makkadafi M.; Fauzi, A.

269132,Do superspreaders generate new superspreaders? A hypothesis to explain the propagation pattern of COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency, indications, and findings of abdominal CTs ordered in the initial evaluation of patients who had a positive COVID-19 test performed in our institution. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who had a positive test for COVID-19 performed at a single quaternary care center from 1/20/2020 through 5/8/2020. In a subset of patients undergoing abdominal CT as part of the initial evaluation, the demographics, suspected COVID-19 status at the time of scan, presenting complaints, and abdominal CT findings were recorded. Cardiothoracic radiologists reviewed and scored the visualized lung bases for the likelihood of COVID-19. RESULTS: Only 43 (4.1%) of 1057 COVID-19 patients presented with abdominal complaints sufficient to warrant an abdominal CT. Of these 43 patients, the vast majority (39, 91%) were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of the scan. Most (27/43, 63%) scans showed no acute abdominal abnormality, and those that were positive did not share a discernable pattern of abnormalities. Lung base abnormalities were common, and there was moderate inter-reviewer reliability. CONCLUSION: A minority of COVID-19 patients present with abdominal complaints sufficient to warrant a dedicated CT of the abdomen, and most of these studies will be negative or have abdominal findings not associated with COVID-19. Appropriate lung base findings are a more consistent indication of COVID-19 infection than abdominal findings.","Barkmeier, Daniel T; Stein, Erica B; Bojicic, Katherine; Otemuyiwa, Bamidele; Vummidi, Dharshan; Chughtai, Aamer; Ellis, James H",Abdom. radiology (Internet),,295
270443,What is the optimal usage of coronavirus disease 2019 convalescent plasma donations?,2021,"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has accentuated the need for speedy access to information. Digital divide and socio-demographic disparity create an information hiatus and therefore unhealthy practices with regard to dealing with COVID-19, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Aims: We assessed knowledge, attitudes, practices and their determinants regarding COVID-19 in Pakistan during March-April 2020. Methods: 905 adults &#8805;18 years (males and females) participated: 403 from a web-based survey; 365 from an urban survey; and 137 from a rural survey. Frequency of adequate knowledge, attitudes and practices for the three populations was determined based on available global guidelines. Multivariable logistic regression analysis determined factors of adequacy of knowledge, attitudes, practices, and association of knowledge with attitudes and practices. Results: Mean age of the participants was 33.5 (+ SD 11.1) years, 51% were females. More females and young adults (18-30 years) participated in the web-based survey. The urban survey and web-based survey participants had significantly higher adequate knowledge (2-7 times) and practices (4-5 times) towards COVID-19. Adequate knowledge had a significant influence on healthy attitudes and practices for COVID-19, after adjustment for covariates. Overall, two-thirds of the population had high levels of fear about COVID-19, which was highest among the rural survey population. Conclusion: Substantial gaps exist in adequate knowledge, attitudes and practices, particularly among rural populations, and underscores the variation in access to information according to level of education and access to the internet. Thus, a comprehensive, contextually congruent awareness raising strategy is urgently needed to confront COVID-19 among these populations.","Fatmi, Zafar; Mahmood, Shafaq; Hameed, Waqas; Qazi, Ibtisam; Siddiqui, Muhammad; Dhanwani, Anny; Siddiqi, Sameen",East Mediterr Health J,,295

Under these circumstances, it is critical to understand discussions surrounding these claims on Twitter, a major platform where the claims disseminate. To this end, we collected and release the VoterFraud2020 dataset, a multi-modal dataset with 7.6M tweets and 25.6M retweets from 2.6M users related to voter fraud claims. To make this data immediately useful for a wide area of researchers, we further enhance the data with cluster labels computed from the retweet graph, user suspension status, and perceptual hashes of tweeted images. We also include in the dataset aggregated information for all external links and YouTube videos that appear in the tweets. Preliminary analyses of the data show that Twitter's ban actions mostly affected a specific community of voter fraud claim promoters, and exposes the most common URLs, images and YouTube videos shared in the data.","Abilov, Anton; Hua, Yiqing; Matatov, Hana; Amir, Ofra; Naaman, Mor",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08210v1.pdf,295

A total of 241 non-diabetic participants from a Chinese rural cohort were included. NAFLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound (NAFLD, n = 71; Non-NAFLD, n = 171). Dietary intake was assessed by a 24-h food recall. Plasma oxidative stress related markers superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR) and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine(8-oxo-dG) were measured. The association between dietary antioxidant vitamin intake, oxidative stress related markers and NAFLD were analysed by Spearman correlation analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis. Mediation models were established to examine whether SOD mediated the association between dietary vitamin A or &#945;-tocopherol intake and NAFLD. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that dietary vitamin A and &#945;-tocopherol intake were positively correlated with SOD (p < .05). Multiple logistic regression analysis found plasma SOD, dietary vitamin A and &#945;-tocopherol intake were inversely associated with NAFLD (all p < .05). Mediation analysis indicated that SOD significantly mediated the indirect effect of dietary &#945;-tocopherol (mediated effect = 13.21% total effect) or vitamin A (mediated effect = 3.12% total effect) intake on NAFLD. Our study indicated that dietary vitamin A and &#945;-tocopherol intake may contribute to protect from NAFLD in Chinese non-diabetics, and the associations were partly mediated by SOD. However, SOD only accounted for a minor percentage of the association between vitamin A intake and NAFLD. Thus, other mechanisms underlying antioxidant vitamin' protective effect on NAFLD need further exploration.","Ma, Chifa; Liu, Yiwen; He, Shuli; Zeng, Jingbo; Li, Pingping; Ma, Chunxiao; Ping, Fan; Zhang, Huabing; Xu, Lingling; Li, Wei; Li, Yuxiu",Free Radic Res,,295
272793,Characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to a regional health system in the southeast,2020,"It is important for dental care professionals to reliably assess carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and ventilation rates in their offices in the era of frequent infectious disease pandemics. This study was to evaluate CO2 levels in dental operatories and determine the accuracy of using CO2 levels to assess ventilation rate in dental clinics. Mechanical ventilation rate in air change per hour (ACHVENT) was measured with an air velocity sensor and airflow balancing hood. CO2 levels were measured in these rooms to analyze factors that contributed to CO2 accumulation. Ventilation rates were estimated using natural steady-state CO2 levels during dental treatments and experimental CO2 concentration decays by dry ice or mixing baking soda and vinegar. We compared the differences and assessed the correlations between ACHVENT and ventilation rates estimated by the steady-state CO2 model with low (0.3 L/min, ACHSS30) or high (0.46 L/min, ACHSS46) CO2 generation rates, by CO2 decay constants using dry ice (ACHDI) or baking soda (ACHBV), and by time needed to remove 63% of excess CO2 generated by dry ice (ACHDI63%) or baking soda (ACHBV63%). We found that ACHVENT varied from 3.9 to 35.0 in dental operatories. CO2 accumulation occurred in rooms with low ventilation (ACHVENT &#8804;6) and overcrowding but not in those with higher ventilation. ACHSS30 and ACHSS46 correlated well with ACHVENT (r = 0.83, P = 0.003), but ACHSS30 was more accurate for rooms with low ACHVENT. Ventilation rates could be reliably estimated using CO2 released from dry ice or baking soda. ACHVENT was highly correlated with ACHDI (r = 0.99), ACHBV (r = 0.98), ACHDI63% (r = 0.98), and ACHBV63% (r = 0.98). There were no statistically significant differences between ACHVENT and ACHDI63% or ACHBV63%. We conclude that ventilation rates could be conveniently and accurately assessed by observing the changes in CO2 levels after a simple mixing of household baking soda and vinegar in dental settings.","Huang, Q; Marzouk, T; Cirligeanu, R; Malmstrom, H; Eliav, E; Ren, Y-F",J Dent Res,,295

Nevertheless, its limitations, regarding its complex isolation procedure, low yield and low water solubility, limit large scale application. Combinatorial therapeutic regimen that combines several drugs to target different pathways in a characteristically synergistic manner at lower doses of drugs proved effective in several diseases treatment. Besides, new knowledge aimed at improving drug delivery into the intracellular environment is essential. In this study, ER was assessed for its cytotoxic effect in combination with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX·HCl) against breast cancer cells. Drug synergy was calculated by using combination index (CI) index and we discovered that they had positive effects. To ensure uniform delivery of both drugs to cells for a desired synergistic action, a dual drug loaded liposomes was developed using thin-film dispersion, and coated by a layer of folate-chitosan. Cytotoxicity and cell proliferation based assays revealed the increase of cell inhibition rate by more than 30% compared with free drugs. Fluorescence imaging revealed that liposomes can aid faster drugs accumulate in cancer cells. The study presented a novel strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.","Xie, Hualing; Feng, Simin; Farag, Mohamed Ali; Sun, Peilong; Shao, Ping",Food Chem Toxicol,,295
275617,COVID-19 pathophysiology may be driven by an imbalance in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,2021,"BACKGROUND: Critically-ill COVID-19 patients have frequent thrombotic complications and laboratory evidence of hypercoagulability. The relationship of coagulation tests and thrombosis requires investigation to identify best diagnostic and treatment approaches. We assessed for hypercoagulable characteristics in critically-ill COVID-19 patients using Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and explored relationships of D-dimer and ROTEM measurements with thrombotic complications. METHODS: Critically-ill adult COVID-19 patients receiving ROTEM testing between March-April 2020 were analyzed. Patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation prior to ROTEM were excluded. ROTEM measurements from COVID-19 patients were compared to non-COVID-19 patients matched by age, sex, and body mass index. Intergroup differences in ROTEM measurements were assessed using t-tests. Correlations of D-dimer levels to ROTEM measurements were assessed in COVID-19 patients who had available concurrent testing. Intergroup differences of D-dimer and ROTEM measurements were explored in COVID-19 patients with and without thrombosis. RESULTS: Of 30 COVID-19 patients receiving ROTEM, we identified hypercoagulability from elevated fibrinogen compared to non-COVID-19 patients (FIBTEM MCF: 47+/-13mm vs 20+/-7mm; mean intergroup difference: 27.4mm; 95%CI: 22.1mm-32.7mm; p<0.0001). In our COVID-19 cohort, thrombotic complications were identified in 33%. In COVID-19 patients developing thrombotic complications, we identified higher D-dimer levels (17.5+/-4.3ug/mL vs 8.0+/-6.3ug/mL; mean difference: 9.5ug/mL; 95%CI: 13.9-5.1; p<0.0001) but lower FIBTEM MCF (39.7+/-10.8mm vs 50.1+/-12.0mm; mean difference: -11.2mm; 95%CI: -2.1 to -20.2; p=0.02) compared to patients without thrombosis. We identified negative correlations of D-dimer levels and ROTEM MCF in these patients (r: -0.61; p=0.001). CONCLUSION: We identified elevated D-dimer levels and hypercoagulable blood clot characteristics from increased fibrinogen on ROTEM testing in critically-ill COVID-19 patients. However, we identified lower, albeit still hypercoagulable, ROTEM measurements of fibrinogen in COVID-19 patients with thrombotic complications compared to those without. Further work is required to externally validate these findings and to investigate the mechanistic drivers for these relationships to identify best diagnostic and treatment approaches for these patients.

For example, the recent global outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed viral infection-induced ARDS under the spotlight. Moreover, chronic lung disease ranks the third leading cause of death in the United States. Hypoxia signaling plays a diverse role in both acute and chronic lung inflammation, which could partially be explained by the divergent function of downstream target pathways such as adenosine signaling. Particularly, hypoxia signaling activates adenosine signaling to inhibit the inflammatory response in ARDS, while in chronic lung diseases, it promotes inflammation and tissue injury. In this review, we discuss the role of adenosine at the interphase of hypoxia and inflammation in ARDS and chronic lung diseases, as well as the current strategy for therapeutic targeting of the adenosine signaling pathway.","Li, Xiangyun; Berg, Nathanial K; Mills, Tingting; Zhang, Kaiying; Eltzschig, Holger K; Yuan, Xiaoyi",Front Immunol,,295

Clinicians, restaurant cooks, cashiers, transit operators, and other essential workers (EWs), however, continued to work outside the home during this time in order to keep others alive and maintain a functioning society. In the United States, EWs are often low-income persons of color who are more likely to face socioeconomic vulnerabilities, systemic racism, and health inequities. To assess the various impacts of COVID-19 on EWs, an online survey was distributed to a representative sample of individuals residing in six states during May/June 2020. The sample included 990 individuals who identified as EWs and 736 nonessential workers (NWs). We assessed differences between EW and NW respondents according to three categories related to health equity and social determinants of health: (1) demographics (e.g. race/ethnicity); (2) COVID-19 exposure risk pathways (e.g. ability to social distance); and (3) COVID-19 risk perceptions (e.g. perceived risk of contracting COVID-19). EWs were more likely to be Black or Hispanic than NWs and also had lower incomes and education levels on average. Unsurprisingly, EWs were substantially more likely to report working outside the home and less likely to report social distancing and wearing masks indoors as compared to NWs.

Co-existence of diabetes and obesity could cause an even higher risk of severe outcomes due to immunity dysfunction. We conducted a retrospective study in 1637 adult patients who were admitted into an acute hospital in Wuhan, China. Propensity score matched logistic regression was used to estimate the risks of severe pneumonia and requiring in-hospital oxygen therapy associated with obesity. After adjustment for age, sex and comorbidities, obesity was significantly associated with higher odds of severe pneumonia (odd ratio [OR] 1.47 [95% CI 1.15-1.88], P=0.002) and oxygen therapy (OR 1.40 [95% CI 1.10-1.79], P=0.007). Higher ORs of severe pneumonia due to obesity were observed in men, older adults and those with diabetes. Among patients with diabetes, overweight increased the odds of requiring in-hospital oxygen therapy by 0.68 times (P=0.014) and obesity increased the odds by 1.06 times (P=0.028). A linear dose-response curve between BMI and severe outcomes was observed in all patients, whereas a U-shaped curve in those with diabetes. Our findings provide important evidence to support obesity as an independent risk factor for severe outcomes of COVID-19 infection in the early phase of the ongoing pandemic.","Cao, Peihua; Song, Ying; Zhuang, Zian; Ran, Jinjun; Xu, Lin; Geng, Yan; Han, Lefei; Zhao, Shi; Qin, Jing; He, Daihai; Wu, Fengfu; Yang, Lin",Diabetes,,295

291323,Multiple Emergency Department Presentations of COVID-19-Related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), which is characterized by clinical manifestations such as pneumonia, lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory distress, and cytokine storm. S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-II) to enter into the lungs through membrane proteases consequently inflicting the extensive viral load through rapid replication mechanisms. Despite several research efforts, challenges in COVID-19 management still persist at various levels that include (a) availability of a low cost and rapid self-screening test, (b) lack of an effective vaccine which works against multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2, and (c) lack of a potent drug that can reduce the complications of COVID-19. The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is a complicated process due to the emergence of mutant variants with greater virulence and their ability to invoke intricate lung pathophysiology. Moreover, the lack of a thorough understanding about the virus transmission mechanisms and complete pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is making it hard for medical scientists to develop a better strategy to prevent the spread of the virus and design a clinically viable vaccine to protect individuals from being infected. A recent report has tested the hypothesis of T cell immunity and found effective when compared to the antibody response in agammaglobulinemic patients. Understanding SARS-CoV-2-induced changes such as ""Th-2 immunopathological variations, mononuclear cell & eosinophil infiltration of the lung and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)"" in COVID-19 patients provides key insights to develop potential therapeutic interventions for immediate clinical management. Therefore, in this review, we have described the details of rapid detection methods of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular and serological tests and addressed different therapeutic modalities used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. In addition, the current challenges against the development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are also briefly described in this article.","Beeraka, Narasimha M; Tulimilli, SubbaRao V; Karnik, Medha; Sadhu, Surya P; Pragada, Rajeswara Rao; Aliev, Gjumrakch; Madhunapantula, SubbaRao V",Biomed Res Int,,295

Sepsis affects roughly 20 million people every year, resulting in over 11 million deaths. The need for faster more accurate diagnostics and better management is therefore paramount in the fight to prevent these avoidable deaths. Here we report the development of a POC device with the ability to identify a broad range of pathogens on a lateral flow platform. Namely Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The simple to use laboratory device has the potential to be automated, thus enabling an operator to carry out solid-phase lysis and room temperature RPA in situ, providing accurate results in hours rather than days. Results show there is a potential for a fully automated device in which concepts described in this paper can be integrated into a lateral flow device.","Heeroma, Alice Jane; Gwenin, Christopher",,,295

These in turn impact the established world economy, create jobless situations, physical, mental, emotional stress, and challenge the human survival. Therefore, timely detection, treatment, isolation and prevention of spreading the pandemic infectious diseases not beyond the originated town is critical to avoid global impairment of life (e.g., Corona virus disease - 2019, COVID-19). The objective of this review article is to emphasize the recent advancements in the electrochemical diagnostics of twelve life-threatening viruses namely - COVID-19, Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Influenza, Hepatitis, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Human papilloma virus (HPV), Zika virus, Herpes simplex virus, Chikungunya, Dengue, and Rotavirus. This review describes the design, principle, underlying rationale, receptor, and mechanistic aspects of sensor systems reported for such viruses. Electrochemical sensor systems which comprised either antibody or aptamers or direct/mediated electron transfer in the recognition matrix were explicitly segregated into separate sub-sections for critical comparison. This review emphasizes the current challenges involved in translating laboratory research to real-world device applications, future prospects and commercialization aspects of electrochemical diagnostic devices for virus detection. The background and overall progress provided in this review are expected to be insightful to the researchers in sensor field and facilitate the design and fabrication of electrochemical sensors for life-threatening viruses with broader applicability to any desired pathogens.","Goud, K Yugender; Reddy, K Koteshwara; Khorshed, Ahmed; Kumar, V Sunil; Mishra, Rupesh K; Oraby, Mohamed; Ibrahim, Alyaa Hatem; Kim, Hern; Gobi, K Vengatajalabathy",Biosens Bioelectron,,295

denominado SARS-CoV-2 ha roto las reglas de ese dominio Primeramente, porque lo que se refiere a replicación y autopsia, términos ligados a la biología, dejan de ser metáforas Seguidamente, porque el confinamiento que ha conllevado el control de la pandemia se ha organizado en las propias ciudades, demostrando que no han sido pensadas, inventadas contra un enemigo como éste Tercero, porque la proliferación de información en la cuarentena no ha servido sino para reivindicar las mismas formas y modos de vida que dominaban el planeta, con propuestas de adaptación remediales, no integrales Virus e información se disputan un lugar de privilegio para apropiarse el uno el cuerpo del otro A través de un minucioso registro de lecturas hechas durante el periodo de encierro, apenas relajado en los días en que se entrega este artículo, se pretende demostrar que no tenemos aún conciencia de la oportunidad de redefinir las alineaciones de la Tardomodernidad, si confiamos en la formulación de lecturas contra-históricas, metáforas aún, pero que desintegren nuestras convicciones más paralizadoras De ahí saldrá la ciudad por llegar, para albergar lo que denomino vida con valor Estas metáforas

evolution and replicated the most effective models around the world with a mastery precision whose consequences are discovered like an autopsy, at the wrong time This paper is written in the period when a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 has broken the rules of that domain Firstly, because the words replication and autopsy, terms linked to biology are no longer metaphors Secondly, because the confinement measures put in place to control the pandemic have been organized in the cities themselves, demonstrating that they have not been thought out or designed against such an enemy Thirdly, because the proliferation of information during the quarantine has served only to claim the same forms and ways of life that dominated the planet, with remedial, not integral, proposals for adaptation Viruses and information dispute a privileged place to appropriate each other's bodies Through a meticulous record of readings made during the period of confinement, barely relaxed in the days when this article is submitted, it is intended to demonstrate that we are not yet aware of the opportunity to redefine the alignments of the Late Modernity, if we trust the formulation of counter-historical readings, metaphors yet, but which disintegrate our most paralyzing convictions That is where the city to come will emerge, to house what I call life with value These counter-mythological metaphors refer us to the reformulation of our origins This argument will be exemplified through a double contrast −between two architects and two paintings Jean Prouvé and Rem Koolhaas;and Velázquez's Forge of Vulcan and Tiepolo’s Santa Tecla praying for the Plague− With Prouvé, we will close the process of construction as we know it and the forge will be its counter-mythology With Koolhaas, we will disclose ourselves to an outside world where the opportunity should be taken to recognise our own mental confinement so that questions freed from a self-imposed logic might then emerge Tiepolo’s composition allows us to go back to his encounter, thus returning with the impulse of Eros, a figure that represents the revolutionary aspiration to a completely different way of life and society The conclusion is that the counter-mythological procedure is germane, although the unlikely achievement of a courageous planetary metamorphosis of the magnitude of the pandemic creeping on us, does not foresee great social transformations If these are not to happen, the mutations in the social, public, and spatial forms embedded in our cities will be tragic in the short term Alternate abstract: A cidade é o lugar da humanidade É a sua maior invenção Com esse pensamento, medimos nossa evolução e replicamos os modelos mais eficazes em todo o

295790,Myocardial injury in a patient with severe coronavirus disease: A case report,2020,"Vitamin D is known not only for its importance for bone health but also for its biologic activities on many other organ systems. This is due to the presence of the vitamin D receptor in various types of cells and tissues, including the skin, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, endocrine pancreas, immune cells, and blood vessels. Experimental studies have shown that vitamin D exerts several actions that are thought to be protective against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infectivity and severity. These include the immunomodulatory effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems, the regulatory effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system in the kidneys and the lungs, and the protective effects against endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in protecting against risk of acquiring acute respiratory viral infection and may improve outcomes in sepsis and critically ill patients. There are a growing number of data connecting COVID-19 infectivity and severity with vitamin D status, suggesting a potential benefit of vitamin D supplementation for primary prevention or as an adjunctive treatment of COVID-19. Although the results from most ongoing randomized clinical trials aiming to prove the benefit of vitamin D supplementation for these purposes are still pending, there is no downside to increasing vitamin D intake and having sensible sunlight exposure to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at a level of least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and preferably 40 to 60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L) to minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection and its severity.","Charoenngam, Nipith; Shirvani, Arash; Holick, Michael F",Endocr Pract,,295

Preventive measures such as hygiene, social distancing, and isolation, essential to stop the spread of coronavirus, are difficult to accomplish for vulnerable populations due to their living conditions. Seroepidemiological surveys are assets to measure the transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Until July 1st, the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Barrio Padre Mugica, one of the largest slums in Buenos Aires City, was 5.9%. This study aimed to establish the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies immunoglobulin G (IgG) immediately after the outbreak, and to identify neighbourhood, household and individual factors associated with seroconversion. The prevalence based on IgG was 53.4% (95% CI 52.8% to 54.1%). For each polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) confirmed case, nine people tested IgG positive, indicating a high rate of undetected (probably asymptomatic) infections. Hence, the high rate of undiagnosed people suggests that clinical criteria and epidemiological nexus should be considered. The high seroprevalence observed in the context of an intense epidemic in a vulnerable area might serve as a reference to other countries. This study contributes to future decision making by understanding population immunity against SARS-CoV2 and its relation to living conditions and foccus that comprehensive biosocial, household-level interventions are needed.","Figar, S.; Pagotto, V.; Luna, L.; Salto, J.; Wagner Manslau, M.; Mistchenko, A.

This study was designed to develop an HPLC-MS/MS method for the determination of silybin in human plasma, urine and breast tissue in early breast cancer patients undergoing Siliphos® supplementation, an oral silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex. The determination of silybin was carried out by liquid-liquid extraction with methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE); total silybin concentration was determined by treating the samples with ß-glucuronidase, while for the determination of free silybin, the hydrolytic step was omitted. Naringenin and naproxen were selected as internal standards. The detection of the analyte was carried out by mass spectrometry and by chromatography. The HPLC-MS/MS method was evaluated in terms of selectivity, linearity, limit of quantification, precision and accuracy, and carryover. The method proved to be selective, linear, precise and accurate for the determination of silybin. To the best of our knowledge, this presents the first analytical method with the capacity to quantify the major bioactive components of milk thistle in three different biological matrices with a lower limit of quantification of 0.5 ng/mL for plasma.

301598,LB-13. Economic and workload impact of COVID-19 pandemic on physicians in the United States: results of a national survey,2020,"BACKGROUND: Radiologists undertake a wide variety of functions which have altered as technologies have evolved. The aim of this survey was to explore radiologists' opinions concerning their role and identity in 2020. METHODS: The survey included 124 questions on training, daily work, interaction with colleagues and patients, involvement in teaching, research and management and task delegation. An initial draft was amended following responses from the Presidents of the 48 ESR's national institutional member societies. The final on-line survey was available to individual ESR full members between January and March 2020. 1344 responses from radiologists in 49 European countries were obtained. FINDINGS: 80% (1049/1317) of radiologists considered a period of non-radiology clinical training mandatory and 92% (1192/1291) felt that sub-specialty expertise was important and improved the visibility of radiologists. 76% (961/1262) of radiologists regularly communicate directly with patients. Only 25% (314/1238) had undergone formal communications training although 82% (1020/1238) felt that this would be beneficial. Radiologists highly value their positive interaction with colleagues, including within multi-disciplinary team meetings, despite limited resources. Difficulties identified included high workload, especially the need to cover general work in parallel with the need to offer subspecialty expertise. 66% (837/1262) felt that lack of visibility to patients is a risk to radiology and professional visibility could be improved by radiology-led research and teaching. CONCLUSIONS: ESR activities should aim to (1) support radiologists with sub-specialty training and maintenance of competencies; (2) develop recommendations for patient communications training and multi-disciplinary working with strong clinical integration; (3) enhance radiologists' visibility by harnessing opportunities for radiology-led research and education.",,Insights Imaging,,295

Se concluye que, ante la pandemia, este tipo de trabajadores presenta una situación de vulnerabilidad derivada de la configuración del trabajo que realizan, lo cual se ha intensificado ante la situación actual. Pese a que el transporte público es considerado un servicio esencial, en esta modalidad de transporte se deja la seguridad como un asunto personal, constituyéndose en un eslabón débil en la gestión social de la seguridad sanitaria.Alternate abstract:The objective of this article is to present an analysis of the vulnerability of public transport workers, with emphasis on those who work in the taxi modality in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (ZMVM), in the context of the health emergency caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Related clinical features are needed. METHODS: We reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan between 16 January and 29 January 2020. All patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the final date of follow-up was 4 February 2020. RESULTS: The median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (interquartile range 35.0-62.0), and 32 patients (46%) were men. The most common symptoms were fever (60 [87%]), cough (38 [55%]), and fatigue (29 [42%]). Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients). As of 4 February 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and 5 patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%. According to the lowest SpO2 during admission, cases were divided into the SpO2 &#8805; 90% group (n = 55) and the SpO2 < 90% group (n = 14). All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO2 < 90% group. Compared with SpO2 &#8805; 90% group, patients of the SpO2 < 90% group were older and showed more comorbidities and higher plasma levels of interleukin (IL) 6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and C reactive protein. Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 appears to show frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a mortality rate of 7.5%. Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of death.","Wang, Zhongliang; Yang, Bohan; Li, Qianwen; Wen, Lu; Zhang, Ruiguang",Clin Infect Dis,,295

We aim to review available clinical and biomedical literature on cardiovascular risks of COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, enters the cell via ACE2 expressed in select organs. Emerging epidemiological evidence suggest cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with a more severe form of COVID-19 are also more likely to develop cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmia. The true incidence of and mechanism underlying these events remain elusive. Cardiovascular diseases appear intricately linked with COVID-19, with cardiac complications contributing to the elevated morbidity/mortality of COVID-19. Robust epidemiologic and biologic studies are urgently needed to better understand the mechanism underlying these associations to develop better therapies.","Cheng, Paul; Zhu, Han; Witteles, Ronald M; Wu, Joseph C; Quertermous, Thomas; Wu, Sean M; Rhee, June-Wha",Curr Cardiol Rep,,295

METHODS: Key population-level disease projections in deaths, intensive care unit bed days, and non-intensive care unit bed days were taken from the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team report of March 2020, which influenced the decision to introduce suppression policies in the United Kingdom. National income loss estimates were from a study that estimated the impact of a hypothetical pandemic on the UK economy, with sensitivity analyses based on projections that are more recent. Individual quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss and costed resource use inputs were taken from published sources. RESULTS: Imperial model projected suppression polices compared to an unmitigated pandemic, even with the most pessimistic national income loss scenarios under suppression (10%), give incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below £50 000 per QALY. Assuming a maximum reduction in national income of 7.75%, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for Imperial model projected suppression versus mitigation are below 60 000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Results are uncertain and conditional on the accuracy of the Imperial model projections; they are also sensitive to estimates of national income loss. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to claim that the hypothetical Imperial model-projected suppression policies are obviously cost-ineffective relative to the alternatives available. Despite evolving differences between government policy and Imperial model-projected suppression policy, it is hoped this article will provide some early insight into the trade-offs that are involved.","Zala, Darshan; Mosweu, Iris; Critchlow, Simone; Romeo, Renee; McCrone, Paul",Value Health,,295

Hyponatremia has been associated with a worse outcome in several pathologic conditions The main objective of this study was to determine whether serum sodium alterations may be independent predictors of the outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design and methods: In this observational study, data from 441 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a University Hospital were collected. After excluding 61 patients (no serum sodium at admission available, saline solution infusion before sodium assessment, transfer from another hospital), data from 380 patients were analyzed. Results: 274 (72.1%) patients had normonatremia at admission, 87 (22.9%) patients had hyponatremia and 19 (5%) patients had hypernatremia. We found an inverse correlation between serum sodium and IL-6, whereas a direct correlation between serum sodium and PaO2/FiO2 ratio was observed. Patients with hyponatremia had a higher prevalence of non-invasive ventilation and ICU transfer than those with normonatremia or hypernatremia. Hyponatremia was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (2.7-fold increase vs normonatremia) and each mEq/L of serum sodium reduction was associated with a 14.4% increased risk of death. Conclusions: These results suggest that serum sodium at admission may be considered as an early prognostic marker of disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Berni, Andrea; Malandrino, Danilo; Corona, Giovanni; Maggi, Mario; Parenti, Gabriele; Fibbi, Benedetta; Poggesi, Loredana; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Lavorini, Federico; Fanelli, Andrea; Scocchera, Giulia; Nozzoli, Carlo; Peris, Adriano; Pieralli, Filippo; Pini, Riccardo; Ungar, Andrea; Peri, Alessandro",Eur J Endocrinol,,295

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 1131 COVID-19 patients. Longitudinal coagulation parameters and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Abnormal coagulation parameters were observed in patients with COVID-19, both at hospital admission (INR 2.3%, PT 7.9%, APTT 15.4%, TT 0.9%, FDP 2.3%, D-dimer 19.7%) and peak hospitalization (INR 4.8%, PT 13.4%, APTT 25.6%, TT 2.7%, FDP 10.4%, D-dimer 31.5%). Compared with non-severe patients with COVID-19, severe patients had a slightly higher INR, PT, APTT, whereas remarkably higher FDP and D-dimer (p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, age > 60 years, male, obesity, comorbidity, abnormal D-dimer on hospital admission, and abnormal peak hospitalization PT, APTT, FDP and D-dimer were associated with COVID-19 severity. The extreme coagulation parameters abnormalities (PT > 16s, FDP > 50 ug/ml, and D-dimer > 5 ug/ml) were associated with a significantly higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal coagulation parameters abnormalities are common in patients with COVID-19, and associated with disease severity and mortality.

To do so, we conducted a search of 7 databases for relevant full-text articles. A cohort study and case-control study were included. A meta-analysis was performed to synthesize the pooled odds ratio with a random-effects model. We identified studies that reported mortality among older adults with dementia and non-dementia who have COVID-19. The pooled mortality rates of dementia and non-dementia older adults infected with COVID-19 were 39% (95% CI: 0.23-0.54%, I2 = 83.48%) and 20% (95% CI: 0.16-0.25%, I2 = 83.48%), respectively. Overall, dementia was the main factor influencing poor health outcomes and high rates of mortality in older adults with COVID-19 infection (odds ratio 2.96; 95% CI 2.00-4.38, I2 = 29.7%), respectively. Our results show that older adults with dementia with COVID-19 infection have a higher risk of mortality compared with older adults without dementia. This current study further highlights the need to provide focused care to the older adults with dementia or cognitive impairment who have COVID-19.","Saragih, Ita Daryanti; Saragih, Ice Septriani; Batubara, Sakti Oktaria; Lin, Chia-Ju",Geriatr. nurs,,295

337130,Coronavirus disease 2019 and geographical area of origin,2020,"A total of 3.2 million people in Germany have been fully immunised so far. However, in order to achieve herd immunity, which is likely to require an immunisation rate of around 80 % due to the highly infectious mutants, approximately 65 million people need to be vaccinated. The current ""imbalance"" in the vaccination campaign is largely due to the limited supply of vaccines. Since J&J's vaccine has recently been approved by the EU and additional production facilities are available, it is foreseeable that the capacities of the vaccination centres will no longer be sufficient. Moreover, at some point the existing unwillingness to vaccinate could become the final bottleneck in reaching herd immunity. This paper provides some calculations for these relationships. Against this background, it is questionable how well-prepared the present system is to cope with these foreseeable problems.

337132,Coronavirus disease 2019 and geographical area of origin,2020,"Chest X-rays are the most commonly available and affordable radiological examination for screening thoracic diseases. According to the domain knowledge of screening chest X-rays, the pathological information usually lay on the lung and heart regions. However, it is costly to acquire region-level annotation in practice, and model training mainly relies on image-level class labels in a weakly supervised manner, which is highly challenging for computer-aided chest X-ray screening. To address this issue, some methods have been proposed recently to identify local regions containing pathological information, which is vital for thoracic disease classification. Inspired by this, we propose a novel deep learning framework to explore discriminative information from lung and heart regions. We design a feature extractor equipped with a multi-scale attention module to learn global attention maps from global images. To exploit disease-specific cues effectively, we locate lung and heart regions containing pathological information by a well-trained pixel-wise segmentation model to generate binarization masks. By introducing element-wise logical AND operator on the learned global attention maps and the binarization masks, we obtain local attention maps in which pixels are $1$ for lung and heart region and $0$ for other regions. By zeroing features of non-lung and heart regions in attention maps, we can effectively exploit their disease-specific cues in lung and heart regions. Compared to existing methods fusing global and local features, we adopt feature weighting to avoid weakening visual cues unique to lung and heart regions. Evaluated by the benchmark split on the publicly available chest X-ray14 dataset, the comprehensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","Fang, Jiansheng; Xu, Yanwu; Zhao, Yitian; Yan, Yuguang; Liu, Junling; Liu, Jiang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12430v1.pdf,295

This report describes a case in which the normal development of pregnancy was complicated immediately after the patient had experienced Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the 21st week of gestation. Specific conditions included critical blood flow in the fetal umbilical artery, fetal growth restriction (1st percentile), right ventricular hypertrophy, hydropericardium, echo-characteristics of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (leukomalacia in periventricular area) and intraventricular hemorrhage at the 25th week of gestation. Premature male neonate delivered at the 26th week of gestation died after 1 day 18 h due to asystole. The results of independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR), mass spectrometry and immunohistochemistry analyses of placenta tissue, umbilical cord blood and child blood jointly indicated vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to the fetus, which we conclude to be the major cause for the development of maternal vascular malperfusion in the studied case.","Sukhikh, Gennady; Petrova, Ulyana; Prikhodko, Andrey; Starodubtseva, Natalia; Chingin, Konstantin; Chen, Huanwen; Bugrova, Anna; Kononikhin, Alexey; Bourmenskaya, Olga; Brzhozovskiy, Alexander; Polushkina, Evgeniya; Kulikova, Galina; Shchegolev, Alexander; Trofimov, Dmitry; Frankevich, Vladimir; Nikolaev, Evgeny; Shmakov, Roman G",Viruses,,295

339205,Aortic thrombosis in a patient with COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory syndrome,2021,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in COVID-19. Severity of several inflammation-related diseases has been associated with autoantibodies against RAS, particularly agonistic autoantibodies for angiotensin type-1 receptors (AA-AT1) and autoantibodies against ACE2 (AA-ACE2). Disease severity of COVID-19 patients was defined as mild, moderate or severe following the WHO Clinical Progression Scale and determined at medical discharge. Serum AA-AT1 and AA-ACE2 were measured in COVID-19 patients (n = 119) and non-infected controls (n = 23) using specific solid-phase, sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Serum LIGHT (TNFSF14; tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14) levels were measured with the corresponding assay kit. At diagnosis, AA-AT1 and AA-ACE2 levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group relative to controls, and we observed significant association between disease outcome and serum AA-AT1 and AA-ACE2 levels. Mild disease patients had significantly lower levels of AA-AT1 (p < 0.01) and AA-ACE2 (p < 0.001) than moderate and severe patients. No significant differences were detected between males and females. The increase in autoantibodies was not related to comorbidities potentially affecting COVID-19 severity. There was significant positive correlation between serum levels of AA-AT1 and LIGHT (TNFSF14; rPearson = 0.70, p < 0.001). Both AA-AT1 (by agonistic stimulation of AT1 receptors) and AA-ACE2 (by reducing conversion of Angiotensin II into Angiotensin 1-7) may lead to increase in AT1 receptor activity, enhance proinflammatory responses and severity of COVID-19 outcome. Patients with high levels of autoantibodies require more cautious control after diagnosis. Additionally, the results encourage further studies on the possible protective treatment with AT1 receptor blockers in COVID-19.","Rodriguez-Perez, Ana I; Labandeira, Carmen M; Pedrosa, Maria A; Valenzuela, Rita; Suarez-Quintanilla, Juan A; Cortes-Ayaso, María; Mayán-Conesa, Placido; Labandeira-Garcia, Jose L",J Autoimmun,,295

Patients with COVID-19 are at risk of cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), reduced blood oxygenation, mechanical ventilation, and a high death rate. Although recent studies have shown remdesivir and dexamethasone as treatment options, there is an urgent need to find a treatment to inhibit virus replication and to control the progression of the disease. Essential biometal zinc has generated a lot of excitement as one of the promising candidates to reduce the severity of COVID-19 infection. Several published observations outlined in the review are the reasons why there is a global enthusiasm that zinc therapy could be a possible therapeutic option. However, the biggest challenge in realising the therapeutic value of zinc is lack of optimal treatment modalities such as dose, duration of zinc supplementation and the mode of delivery. In this review, we discuss the regulatory mechanism that hinges upon the bioavailability of zinc. Finally, we propose that intravenous zinc could circumvent the confounding factors affecting the bioavailability of zinc and allow zinc to achieve its therapeutic potential. If successful, due to advantages such as lack of toxicity, low cost and ease of availability, intravenous zinc could be rapidly implemented clinically.","Chinni, Vidyasagar; El-Khoury, John; Perera, Marlon; Bellomo, Rinaldo; Jones, Daryl; Bolton, Damien; Ischia, Joseph; Patel, Oneel",,,295

Here we report that either pharmacological inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase with amitriptyline, imipramine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, or maprotiline, or genetic downregulation of the enzyme prevents infection of cultured cells or freshy isolated human nasal epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2 or pseudoviral pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 particles expressing spike, a bona fide system mimicking SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infection activates acid sphingomyelinase and triggers a release of ceramide on the cell surface. Neutralization or consumption of surface ceramide reduces infection with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. Treating volunteers with a low dose of amitriptyline prevents infection of freshly isolated nasal epithelial cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. The data justify clinical studies investigating whether amitriptyline, a safe drug used clinically for almost 60 years, or other antidepressants that functionally block acid sphingomyelinase prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Carpinteiro, Alexander; Edwards, Michael J; Hoffmann, Markus; Kochs, Georg; Gripp, Barbara; Weigang, Sebastian; Adams, Constantin; Carpinteiro, Elisa; Gulbins, Anne; Keitsch, Simone; Sehl, Carolin; Soddemann, Matthias; Wilker, Barbara; Kamler, Markus; Bertsch, Thomas; Lang, Karl S; Patel, Sameer; Wilson, Gregory C; Walter, Silke; Hengel, Hartmut; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Lang, Philipp; Kornhuber, Johannes; Becker, Katrin Anne; Ahmad, Syed A; Fassbender, Klaus; Gulbins, Erich",Cell Rep Med,,295

345226,Nintedanib treatment for pulmonary fibrosis after coronavirus disease 2019,2021,"BACKGROUND: With the implementation of screening program worldwide, diagnosis of early-stage colorectal cancer steadily increased, including T1 cancer. Current T1 cancer treatment does not differ according to anatomic location. We therefore compared the disease-free survival of T1 cancer arising from rectum versus colon. METHODS: The hospital-based study included subjects with T1 cancer at National Taiwan University Hospital from 2005 to 2014. Clinical, colonoscopy, and histopathology were reviewed for patients with a mean follow-up time of 7.1 (0.7-12.9) years. We conducted Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the risk of recurrence by cancer location and Cox-regression analysis to identify risk factors for T1 cancer recurrence. RESULTS: The final cohort included a total of 343 subjects with T1 cancer (mean age, 64.9 ± 11.7 years; 56.1% males), of whom 25 underwent endoscopic resection alone. Of the subjects who underwent surgery, 50 had lymph node metastasis and 268 did not. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the risk of recurrence was higher in T1 rectal cancer than T1 colon cancer (p =0.022). Rectal location, and larger neoplasm size were independent risk factors for recurrence, with hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of 4.84 (1.18-19.92), and 1.32 (1.06-1.65), respectively. The occurrence of advanced histology did not differ between T1 rectal and colon cancers (p = 0.58). CONCLUSION: T1 cancers arising from the rectum had less favorable recurrence outcomes than those arising from the colon. Further studies are needed to examine whether adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy can reduce the risk of recurrence in T1 rectal cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Current T1 colorectal cancer treatment and surveillance do not differ according to anatomic location. Clinical, colonoscopy, and histopathology were reviewed for 343 T1 cancer patients with a mean follow-up time of 7.1 years. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the risk of recurrence was higher in T1 rectal cancer than T1 colon cancer. Moreover, the rectal location was an independent risk factor for recurrence. T1 cancers from the rectum had less favorable recurrence outcomes than those arising from the colon. It is critical to clarify whether adjuvant therapy or more close surveillance can reduce recurrence risk in T1 rectal cancer.","Chang, Li-Chun; Shun, Chia-Tung; Lin, Been-Ren; Sanduleanu, Silvia; Hsu, Weng-Feng; Wu, Ming-Shiang; Chiu, Han-Mo",Oncologist,,295

However, the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients is unknown. Vitamin B1, B6, B12, vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D), folate, selenium, and zinc levels were measured in 50 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Overall, 76% of the patients were vitamin D deficient and 42% were selenium deficient. No significant increase in the incidence of deficiency was found for vitamins B1, B6, and B12, folate, and zinc in patients with COVID-19. The COVID-19 group showed significantly lower vitamin D values than the healthy control group (150 people, matched by age/sex). Severe vitamin D deficiency (based on a cut-off of &#8804;10 ng/dl) was found in 24.0% of the patients in the COVID-19 group and 7.3% in the control group. Among 12 patients with respiratory distress, 11 (91.7%) were deficient in at least one nutrient. However, patients without respiratory distress showed a deficiency in 30/38 cases (78.9%; p = 0.425). These results suggest that a deficiency of vitamin D or selenium may decrease the immune defenses against COVID-19 and cause progression to severe disease.

By focusing directly on masculinity as a social process, this analysis contributes to the broader literature on gender and leadership, unpacking the gendered double bind that leaders who identify as men must navigate in acknowledging and responding to risks. I examine the responses of Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump suggesting that their respective struggles to acknowledge and respond to the public health threat were not simply the result of a lack of available information to inform rational policy decisions. Acknowledging risk and taking measures to prevent rather than 'fight' are not culturally neutral, they are coded as feminine and 'weak'. Clearly, the delay in the response and subsequent spread of the virus in North America was not inevitable, other jurisdictions were able to respond more quickly. The masculinity double bind may have been one of the factors that undermined a prompt response in the increasingly macho context of North America.","Thomson, Kelly",Health Sociol Rev,,295

Rearrangement of peroxisomal membranes is followed by redistribution of peroxisomal matrix proteins to the cytosol, resulting in a dramatic decrease in the number of mature peroxisomes. The SARS-CoV-2 ORF14 protein was shown to interact physically with human PEX14, a peroxisomal membrane protein required for matrix protein import and peroxisome biogenesis. Given the important roles of peroxisomes in innate immunity, SARS-CoV-2 may directly target peroxisomes, resulting in loss of peroxisome structural integrity, matrix protein content and ability to function in antiviral signaling.","Knoblach, Barbara; Ishida, Ray; Hobman, Tom C; Rachubinski, Richard A",Mol Biol Cell,,295

In this study we evaluate the effects of social isolation on physical activity in mice. Utilizing a pixel-based tracking system, we continuously monitored the movement of isolated mice compared with paired cage mates in the home cage environment. We demonstrate that mice that are socially isolated dramatically decrease their movement when separated from their cage mate, and especially in the dark cycle, when mice are normally most active. When isolated mice are re-paired with their original cage mate, this effect is reversed, and mice return to their prior levels of activity. These findings suggest a close link between social isolation and physical activity, and are of particular interest in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019, when many are forced into isolation. Social isolation may affect an individual's overall activity levels in humans too, which may have unintended effects on health that deserve further consideration.","Clemenza, Kelly; Weiss, Shira H; Cheslack, Keely; Kandel, Denise B; Kandel, Eric R; Levine, Amir A",J Neurosci Res,,295

362970,442. Common symptoms of outpatient COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 Cases: A prospective epidemiologic study in a major US metropolitan area,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: New data has emerged regarding higher risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and its severity and complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, there is a dearth of evidence regarding type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This article explores the possibility of COVID 19 induced diabetes and highlights a potential bidirectional link between COVID 19 and T1DM. METHODS: A literature search was performed with Medline (PubMed), Scopus, and Google Scholar electronic databases till October 2020, using relevant keywords (COVID-19 induced diabetes; COVID-19 and type 1 diabetes; COVID-19 induced DKA; new-onset diabetes after SARS-CoV-2 infection) to extract relevant studies describing relationship between COVID-19 and T1DM. RESULTS: Past lessons and new data teach us that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) can enter islet cells via angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors and cause reversible ß-cell damage and transient hyperglycemia. There have been postulations regarding the potential new-onset T1DM triggered by COVID-19. This article reviews the available evidence regarding the impact and interlink between COVID-19 and &#932;1DM. We also explore the mechanisms behind the viral etiology of &#932;1DM. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can trigger severe diabetic ketoacidosis at presentation in individuals with new-onset diabetes. However, at present, there is no hard evidence that SARS-CoV-2 induces T1DM on it's own accord. Long term follow-up of children and adults presenting with new-onset diabetes during this pandemic is required to fully understand the type of diabetes induced by COVID-19.","Boddu, Sirisha Kusuma; Aurangabadkar, Geeta; Kuchay, Mohammad Shafi",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,295

El presente estudio mixto aporta una nueva mirada acerca del tema, combinando estrategias cualitativas y cuantitativas para identificar las representaciones sociales de la recepción mediática, en un sector de la población en Colombia, durante la cuarentena por la COVID-19. Los resultados indican que estas representaciones son diversas y están asociadas con el canal mediático y la afectación que produce la recepción en el estado de ánimo y la salud mental. En total, se realizaron 80 entrevistas y 1.068 encuestas online en diferentes regiones de Colombia. En la fase cualitativa se encontró que los programas o mensajes recibidos fueron representados positivamente, cuando provienen de la recepción de entretenimiento audiovisual y contribuye a la unidad familiar y a reducir el estrés en la cuarentena. De modo contrario, la recepción mediática fue representada negativamente, cuando los mensajes o noticias recibidas provienen del periodismo o las redes sociales y aumenta la desinformación, la angustia y el miedo al contagio. En la fase cuantitativa se encontró que la recepción mediática disminuyó a medida que trascurría la cuarentena, debido a la sobresaturación informativa y a la proliferación de noticias que enfatizan los riesgos de la COVID-19.

368457,Is there a need to widely prescribe antibiotics in patients hospitalized with COVID-19?,2021,"Background: Faced with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the development of COVID-19 vaccines has been progressing at an unprecedented rate. This study aimed to evaluate the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in China and give suggestions for vaccination strategies and immunization programs accordingly. Methods: In March 2020, an anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted online among Chinese adults. The questionnaire collected socio-demographic characteristics, risk perception, the impact of COVID-19, attitudes, acceptance and attribute preferences of vaccines against COVID-19 during the pandemic. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the influencing factors of vaccination acceptance. Results: Of the 2058 participants surveyed, 1879 (91.3%) stated that they would accept COVID-19 vaccination after the vaccine becomes available, among whom 980 (52.2%) wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible, while others (47.8%) would delay the vaccination until the vaccine’s safety was confirmed. Participants preferred a routine immunization schedule (49.4%) to emergency vaccination (9.0%) or either of them (41.6%). Logistic regression showed that being male, being married, perceiving a high risk of infection, being vaccinated against influenza in the past season, believing in the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination or valuing doctor’s recommendations could increase the probability of accepting COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible, while having confirmed or suspected cases in local areas, valuing vaccination convenience or vaccine price in decision-making could hinder participants from immediate vaccination. Conclusion: During the pandemic period, a strong demand for and high acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination has been shown among the Chinese population, while concerns about vaccine safety may hinder the promotion of vaccine uptake. To expand vaccination coverage, immunization programs should be designed to remove barriers in terms of vaccine price and vaccination convenience, and health education and communication from authoritative sources are important ways to alleviate public concerns about vaccine safety.","Wang, Jiahao; Jing, Rize; Lai, Xiaozhen; Zhang, Haijun; Lyu, Yun; Knoll, Maria Deloria; Fang, Hai",Vaccines,,295
373184,Diagnostic Bias in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Series of Short Cases,2021,"This paper analyzes how longer and shorter period of national lockdown during the first wave of COVID-19 can affect public health and economy of nations. Results show that a) countries with shorter period of lockdown (about 15 days) have a variation of confirmed cases/population (%) higher than countries with longer period of lockdown (more than one month);b) countries with shorter period of lockdown have average fatality rate lower than countries with longer period of lockdown, whereas variation of fatality rate suggests a higher reduction in countries with longer period of lockdown. However, the study reveals that the impact of longer period of national lockdown, as policy response of governments against COVID-19, pandemic seems to generate rather ambiguous effects on public health, however, this longer period of lockdown has a higher negative impact on economic growth of countries in terms of contraction of gross domestic product growth.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We introduce a novel risk-stratified SIR-HCD model that introduces new variables to model the dynamics of low-contact (e.g., work from home) and high-contact (e.g., work on-site) subpopulations while sharing parameters to control their respective R0(t) over time. We test our model on data of daily reported hospitalizations and cumulative mortality of COVID-19 in Harris County, Texas, from May 1, 2020, until October 4, 2020 , collected from multiple sources (USA FACTS, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council COVID-19 report, TMC daily news, and Johns Hopkins University county-level mortality reporting). RESULTS: We evaluated our model's forecasting accuracy in Harris County, TX (the most populated county in the Greater Houston area) during Phase-I and Phase-II reopening. Not only does our model outperform other competing models, but it also supports counterfactual analysis to simulate the impact of future policies in a local setting, which is unique among existing approaches. DISCUSSION: Mortality and hospitalization rates are significantly impacted by local quarantine and reopening policies. Existing models do not directly account for the effect of these policies on infection, hospitalization, and death rates in an explicit and explainable manner. Our work is an attempt to improve prediction of these trends by incorporating this information into the model, thus supporting decision-making. CONCLUSION: Our work is a timely effort to attempt to model the dynamics of pandemics under the influence of local policies.","Huang, Tongtong; Chu, Yan; Shams, Shayan; Kim, Yejin; V Annapragada, Ananth; Subramanian, Devika; Kakadiaris, Ioannis; Gottlieb, Assaf; Jiang, Xiaoqian",J Biomed Inform,,295
377907,Reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with severe COVID-19 disease by advancing ongoing trials of Mesenchymal Stromal (stem) Cell (MSC) therapy - Achieving global consensus and visibility for cellular host-directed therapies,2020,"Background: We conducted this review to summarize the relation between viral mutation and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and also the severity of COVID-19 in vivo and in vitro. Method: Articles were identified through a literature search until 31 May 2021, in PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Results: Sixty-three studies were included. To date, most studies showed that the viral mutations, especially the D614G variant, correlate with a higher infectivity than the wild-type virus. However, the evidence of the association between viral mutation and severity of the disease is scant. A SARS-CoV-2 variant with a 382-nucleotide deletion was associated with less severe infection in patients. The 11,083G &gt;U mutation was significantly associated with asymptomatic patients. By contrast, ORF1ab 4715L and S protein 614G variants were significantly more frequent in patients from countries where high fatality rates were also reported. The current evidence showed that variants of concern have led to increased infectivity and deteriorating epidemiological situations. However, the relation between this variant and severity of COVID-19 infection was contradictory. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread worldwide. It is necessary to anticipate large clinical cohorts to evaluate the virulence and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 mutants.","Dao, Thi Loi Hoang Van Thuan Colson Philippe Lagier Jean Christophe Million Matthieu Raoult Didier Levasseur Anthony Gautret Philippe",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,295

379569,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a versatile player in the management of coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Career firefighters experience chronic circadian rhythm disruption, increasing their risk of cardiometabolic disease. The recent discovery that eating patterns regulate circadian rhythmicity in metabolic organs has raised the hypothesis that maintaining a consistent daily cycle of eating and fasting can support circadian rhythms and reduce disease risks. Preclinical animal studies and preliminary clinical trials have shown promising effects of time-restricted eating (TRE) to reduce disease risk without compromising physical performance. However, there is a lack of research on TRE in shift workers including firefighters. This study aims to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of 10-hour TRE on health parameters that contribute to cardiometabolic disease risks among career firefighters who work on a 24-hour shift schedule. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The Healthy Heroes Study is a randomised controlled parallel open-label clinical trial with 150 firefighters over 1 year. Firefighters are randomised with a 1:1 ratio to either the control or intervention group. The control group receives Mediterranean diet nutritional counselling (standard of care, 'SOC'). The intervention group receives the same SOC and a self-selected 10-hour TRE window. After the 2-week baseline, participants enter a 3-month monitored intervention, followed by a 9-month self-guided period with follow-up assessments. The impact of TRE on blood glucose, body weight, body composition, biomarkers (neuroendocrine, inflammatory and metabolic), sleep and mood is evaluated. These assessments occur at baseline, at the end of intervention and at 6, 9 and 12-month follow-ups. Temporal calorie intake is monitored with the smartphone application myCircadianClock throughout the study. Continuous glucose monitors, wrist-worn actigraphy device and questionnaires are used to monitor glucose levels, activity, sleep and light exposure. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of California San Diego and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed manuscripts, reports and presentations.

It has a social dimension and is shaped by various social factors. DATA: We employ original data from a large survey (N = 20,632) conducted in China from April 21 to 23, 2020, which provide us with a rare opportunity to investigate COVID-19-induced worry among ordinary Chinese citizens. RESULTS: We find individuals' socioeconomic status, family characteristics, sense of community, and perceived strictness of lockdown measures all have significant influences on worry about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: First, individuals with higher socioeconomic status such as better education, better income, and more prestigious occupations have richer resources in coping with COVID-19 and are thus less worried. Second, the high human-to-human transmissibility of COVID-19 and increased family obligations during the pandemic imply that larger family size can be a worry-inducing burden. Individuals living with larger families are more worried. Third, a greater sense of community lowers worry as it buffers against the stressor and may enhance individuals' faith in the community's efficacy in containing the virus. Last, stringent lockdown measures may actually have positive psychological effects. They provide real and perceived protection and increase individuals' perceived distance from the disease, thereby reducing public worry.","Zhou, Min; Guo, Wei",Soc Sci Med,,295

The study identifies antibiotic resistance in K. pneumoniae isolated from tertiary hospitals during pandemic COVID-19. Among 220 clinical isolates, the total rate of K. pneumoniae was found to be 89 (40.5%). Phenotyping results confirmed the resistance of aminoglycoside antibiotics in 51 (23.2%) of K. pneumoniae isolates. PCR results confirmed the existence of one or more aminoglycoside genes in 82.3% of the 51 isolates. The rmtD gene was the highest-detected gene (66.7%), followed by aac(6')-Ib (45.1%), aph(3')-Ia (45.1%), rmtB (29.4%), armA (21.6%), aac(3)-II (7.8%), and rmtA (3) (11.8%). Significantly, higher resistance strains showed a higher prevalence (61.5%) of aminoglycoside genes (p < 0.05). During COVID-19, there is a higher risk of acquiring MDR bacterial infections, so the monitoring of multidrug resistant bacteria must be continuously undertaken to implement effective measures in infection control and prevention.","Ahmed, Omar B; Asghar, Atif H; Bahwerth, Fayez S",,,295

A novel NO delivery system is described. METHODS: We developed a gas delivery system that utilizes standard respiratory circuit connectors, a reservoir bag, and a scavenging chamber containing calcium hydroxide. The performance of the system was tested using a mechanical lung, assessing the NO concentration delivered at varying inspiratory flows. Safety was assessed in vitro and in vivo by measuring nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in the delivered NO gas. Lastly, we measured the inspired and expired NO and NO2 of this system in 5 healthy subjects during a 15-min administration of high dose NO (160 parts-per-million, ppm) using our delivery system. RESULTS: The system demonstrated stable delivery of prescribed NO levels at various inspiratory flow rates (0-50 L/min). The reservoir bag and a high flow of entering air minimized the oscillation of NO concentrations during inspiration on average 4.6 ppm for each 10 L/min increment in lung inspiratory flow. The calcium hydroxide scavenger reduced the inhaled NO2 concentration on average 0.9 ppm (95% CI -1.58, -0.22; p = .01). We performed 49 NO administrations of 160 ppm in 5 subjects. The average concentration of inspired NO was 164.8±10.74 ppm, with inspired NO2 levels of 0.7±0.13 ppm. The subjects did not experience any adverse events; transcutaneous methemoglobin concentrations increased from 1.05±0.58 to 2.26±0.47%. CONCLUSIONS: The system we developed to administer high-dose NO for inhalation is easy to build, reliable, was well tolerated in healthy subjects.","Gianni, Stefano; Morais, Caio C A; Larson, Grant; Pinciroli, Riccardo; Carroll, Ryan; Yu, Binglan; Zapol, Warren M; Berra, Lorenzo",Nitric Oxide,,295

In patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is considered a rescue therapy that provides adequate gas exchange. The way in which mechanical ventilation is applied during VV-ECMO is not clear, however it is associated with prognosis. Currently, the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients that receive VV-ECMO stands at approximately 50%. Here, we report three patients that successfully recovered from COVID-19-induced ARDS after VV-ECMO and implementation of an ultra-protective ventilation. This ventilation strategy involved maintaining a peak inspiratory pressure of &#8804;20 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of &#8804; 10 cmH2O, which are lower values than have been previously reported. Thus, we suggest that this ultra-protective ventilation be considered during VV-ECMO as it minimizes the ventilator-induced lung injury.","Park, Mi Hwa; Kim, Ah Jin; Lee, Man-Jong; Kim, Young Sam; Kim, Jung Soo",Medicina (Kaunas),,295

SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans, however there have been previous outbreaks of different versions of the beta coronavirus including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV1) from 2002 to 2003 and the most recent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) which was first identified in 2012. All of the above have been recognised as major pathogens that are a great threat to public health and global economies. Currently, no specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified; however, certain drugs have shown apparent efficacy in viral inhibition of the disease. Natural substances such as herbs and mushrooms have previously demonstrated both great antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, the possibilities of natural substances as effective treatments against COVID-19 may seem promising. One of the potential candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be Inonotus obliquus (IO), also known as chaga mushroom. IO commonly grows in Asia, Europe and North America and is widely used as a raw material in various medical conditions.

With half of the world's countries in lockdown as of April due to this pandemic, monitoring and understanding the spread of the virus and infection rates and how these factors relate to behavioural and societal parameters is crucial for developing control strategies. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of masks, social distancing, lockdown and self-isolation for reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our findings from an agent-based simulation modelling showed that whilst requiring a lockdown is widely believed to be the most efficient method to quickly reduce infection numbers, the practice of social distancing and the usage of surgical masks can potentially be more effective than requiring a lockdown. Our multivariate analysis of simulation results using the Morris Elementary Effects Method suggests that if a sufficient proportion of the population uses surgical masks and follows social distancing regulations, then SARS-CoV-2 infections can be controlled without requiring a lockdown.","Li, Kelvin K F; Jarvis, Stephen A; Minhas, Fayyaz",Comput Biol Med,,295
400871,[Study on medication regularity of traditional Chinese medicine in treatment of COVID-19 based on data mining],2020,"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are a critical resource in the effort to control the COVID-19 pandemic. They are also a sentinel surveillance population whose clinical status reflects the effectiveness of the hospital's infection prevention measures in the pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in Singapore General Hospital (SGH), a 1,822-bed tertiary hospital. Participants were all HCWs working in SGH during the study period. HCW protection measures included clinical workflows and personal protective equipment developed and adapted to minimise the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. HCW monitoring comprised staff contact logs in high-risk locations, twice-daily temperature monitoring, assessment of HCWs with acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) in the staff clinic and, in the event of an exposure, extensive contact tracing, detailed risk assessment and risk-based interventions. HCW surveillance utilised monitoring data and ARI presentations and outcomes. RESULTS: In the ten-week period between 6 January 2020 and 16 March 2020, 333 (17.1%) of 1,946 HCWs at risk of occupational COVID-19 presented with ARI. 32 (9.6%) screened negative for SARS-CoV-2 from throat swabs. Five other HCWs developed COVID-19 attributed to non-clinical exposures. From the nine COVID-19 exposure episodes investigated, 189 HCW contacts were identified, of whom 68 (36.2%) were placed on quarantine and remained well. CONCLUSION: Early in an emerging infectious disease outbreak, close monitoring of frontline HCWs is essential in ascertaining the effectiveness of infection prevention measures. HCWs are at risk of community disease acquisition and should be monitored and managed to prevent onward transmission.","Venkatachalam, Indumathi; Conceicao, Edwin Philip; Aung, May Kyawt; How, Molly Kue Bien; Wee, Liang En; Sim, Jean Xiang Ying; Tan, Ban Hock; Ling, Moi Lin",Singap. med. j,,295

High number of intensive care unit beds and ventilators, national treatment algorithms, governmental support for free testing and medications, tedious contact-tracing with early detection and isolation of cases together with early shelter-in-place for the elderly and youngsters, and subsequent weekend curfews in selected cities have so far prevented the surge pressure on the health care system. At this phase, Turkey needs to adopt an evidence-based, proactive control system for an effective transition process to normalize the situation.

As with many other diseases, natural compounds can be helpful in the treatment of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme has an important role in viral replication and transcription. Therefore, inhibiting this enzyme may be helpful in the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, it is aimed to investigate eight natural compounds which have recently entered the literature, computationally for their potential use against SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, first, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on the investigated compounds, and energy minimizations, geometry optimizations, vibrational analyses, molecular electrostatic potential map calculations were carried out. After DFT calculations, geometry optimized structures were subjected to molecular docking calculations with the use of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (pdb id: 5r80) and top-scoring ligand-receptor complexes were obtained. In the next part of the study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the top-scoring ligand-receptor complexes to investigate the stability of the ligand-receptor complexes and the interactions between ligands and receptor in more detail. Additionally, in this part of the study, binding free energies are calculated with the use of molecular mechanics with Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method. Results showed that, all ligand-receptor complexes remain stable during the MD simulations and most of the investigated compounds but especially two of them showed considerably high binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 main protease.

These robots assist first responders by performing tasks that are impractical or impossible for humans. Unfortunately, current disaster robots usually lack the maneuverability to efficiently traverse these areas, which often necessitate extreme navigational capabilities, such as centimeter-scale clearance. Recent work has shown that it is possible to control the locomotion of insects such as the Madagascar hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) through bioelectrical stimulation of their neuro-mechanical system. This provides access to a novel agent that can traverse areas that are inaccessible to traditional robots. In this paper, we present a data-driven inertial navigation system that is capable of localizing cockroaches in areas where GPS is not available. We pose the navigation problem as a two-point boundary-value problem where the goal is to reconstruct a cockroach's trajectory between the starting and ending states, which are assumed to be known. We validated our technique using nine trials that were conducted in a circular arena using a biobotic agent equipped with a thorax-mounted, low-cost inertial measurement unit.

403973,Optimizing Use of COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment among Resident Physicians at a Veterans Affairs Hospital,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To directly compare the prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction (smell and taste) in geographically distinct regions with the same questionnaires. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the self-reported symptoms among adults (older than 18 years) who underwent COVID-19 testing at an ambulatory assessment center in Canada and at a hospital in Israel between March 16, 2020, and August 19, 2020. The primary outcome was the prevalence of self-reported chemosensory dysfunction (anosmia/hypomsia and dysgeusia/ageusia). Subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate the prevalence of chemosensory deficits among the outpatients. RESULTS: We identified a total of 350 COVID-19-positive patients (138 Canadians and 212 Israelis). The overall prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction was 47.1%. There was a higher proportion of chemosensory deficits among Canadians compared to Israelis (66.7% vs 34.4%, P < .01). A subgroup analysis for outpatients (never hospitalized) still identified a higher prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction among Canadians compared to Israelis (68.2% vs 36.1%, P < 0.01). A majority of patients recovered their sense of smell after 4 weeks of symptom onset. CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of chemosensory deficit in COVID-19 was found to be similar to previously published reports, the prevalence can vary significantly across different geographical regions. Therefore, it is important to obtain regionally specific data so that the symptom of anosmia/dysgeusia can be used as a guide for screening for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.","Lee, Daniel J; Daliyot, Daniella; Wang, Ri; Lockwood, Joel; Das, Paul; Zimlichman, Eyal; Lee, John M",Ear Nose Throat J,,295

As a result of the pandemic, increased mental health burdens have been recorded in young adults around the world. We sought to understand the association of stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic with symptoms of psychological and emotional distress in young Canadian adults. METHOD: Questionnaire respondents were asked about the extent to which they were personally impacted by COVID-19, and symptoms related to depression, anxiety, post-traumatic disorder, and emotional distress. RESULTS: Of 84 respondents, most identified as female (74%; 62/84). Overall, 61% (51/84) reported experiencing symptoms of psychological distress related to depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); specifically, 43% (36/84) reported anxiety-related symptoms, 33% (28/84) reported depression-related symptoms, and 6% (5/84) reported PTSD-related symptoms. Individuals with family in settings high risk for COVID-19 infection and individuals who received government aid with a reduction in income were 4.30-fold and 2.80-fold more likely, respectively, to experience symptoms of psychological distress (95% CI 1.31-14.14; p = .013 and 95% CI 1.08-7.25; p = .038, respectively). Visits to social media daily to hourly for COVID-19 related news resulted in a 3.24-fold increase in the likelihood of experiencing depression-related symptoms (95% CI 1.26-8.35; p = .020). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a necessity to focus on alleviating the mental health burdens and contributing stressors within young Canadian adults. Though the mental health burdens are currently exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, they may persist after the pandemic ends if left unaddressed.","Gill, Praneet K; Du, Cynthia; Khan, Farihah; Karimi, Nima; Sabharwal, Kanav; Agarwal, Malvika",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,295
404949,Tuberculosis and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: an inflammatory danger signal in the time of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying altered susceptibility and propensity to severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease in at-risk groups such as patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are poorly understood. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are widely used in COPD, but the extent to which these therapies protect or expose patients to risk of severe COVID-19 is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ICSs following pulmonary expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). METHODS: We evaluated the effect of ICS administration on pulmonary ACE2 expression in vitro in human airway epithelial cell cultures and in vivo in mouse models of ICS administration. Mice deficient in the type I IFN-&#945;/ß receptor (Ifnar1-/-) and administration of exogenous IFN-ß were used to study the functional role of type-I interferon signaling in ACE2 expression. We compared sputum ACE2 expression in patients with COPD stratified according to use or nonuse of ICS. RESULTS: ICS administration attenuated ACE2 expression in mice, an effect that was reversed by exogenous IFN-ß administration, and Ifnar1-/- mice had reduced ACE2 expression, indicating that type I interferon contributes mechanistically to this effect. ICS administration attenuated expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cell cultures from patients with COPD and in mice with elastase-induced COPD-like changes. Compared with ICS nonusers, patients with COPD who were taking ICSs also had reduced sputum expression of ACE2. CONCLUSION: ICS therapies in COPD reduce expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2. This effect may thus contribute to altered susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with COPD.","Finney, Lydia J; Glanville, Nicholas; Farne, Hugo; Aniscenko, Julia; Fenwick, Peter; Kemp, Samuel V; Trujillo-Torralbo, Maria-Belen; Loo, Su Ling; Calderazzo, Maria Adelaide; Wedzicha, Jadwiga A; Mallia, Patrick; Bartlett, Nathan W; Johnston, Sebastian L; Singanayagam, Aran",J. allergy clin. immunol,,295

405051,Adult multisystem inflammatory syndrome in a patient who recovered from COVID-19 postvaccination,2021,"Knowledge of the antibody-mediated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to understand virus immunogenicity, establish seroprevalence, and determine whether subjects or recovered patients are at risk for infection/reinfection and would therefore benefit from vaccination. Here, we describe a novel and simple cell-ELISA specifically designed to measure viral spike S1-specific IgG produced in vitro by B cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from a cohort of 45 asymptomatic (n = 24) and symptomatic (n = 21) individuals, with age ranging from 8 to 99 years. All subjects underwent ELISA serological screening twice, at the same time as the cell-ELISA (T2) as well as 35-60 days earlier (T1). Cryopreserved PBMCs of healthy donors obtained years before the COVID-19 pandemic were also included in the analysis. The preliminary results presented here show that out of 45 tested subjects, 16 individuals (35.5%) were positive to the cell-ELISA, 11 (24.5%) were concomitantly positive in the serological screening (T1 and/or T2), and only one person was exclusively positive in ELISA (T1) and negative in cell-ELISA, though values were close to the cutoff. Of note, five individuals (11.2%) tested negative in ELISA but positive in cell-ELISA and thus, they appear to have circulating B cells that produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, likely at levels that are undetectable in the serum, which challenges the negative results of the serological screening. The relative level of in vitro secreted IgG was measurable in positive subjects, ranging from 7 to 50 ng/well. Accordingly, all anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive subjects previously reported moderate to severe symptoms attributable to COVID-19, even though the RT-PCR data were rarely available to confirm viral infection. Overall, the described cell-ELISA might be an effective method for detecting subjects who encountered the virus in the past, and thus helpful to improve serological ELISA tests in the case of undetectable/equivocal circulating IgG levels, and a suitable and improved tool to better evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zarletti, Gianpaolo; Tiberi, Massimo; De Molfetta, Veronica; Bossù, Maurizio; Toppi, Elisa; Bossù, Paola; Scapigliati, Giuseppe",Viruses,,295

409910,"Psychological interventions for covid-19 outbreak in mazandaran province, iran",2020,"Importance: This article briefly reports the experience of mental health services and the lessons learned during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis. In particular, this report offers opportunities to build on experience gained in managing the COVID-19 emergency in the Departments of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHAs) in Lombardy, the wealthiest Italian region, which has approximately 10 million inhabitants. Observations: Italy has a National Mental Health System divided into 134 DMHAs, 27 of which are in Lombardy. In the 4 weeks after the epidemic started, important changes occurred in the management of DMHAs in Lombardy. Many challenges have occurred in the management of health services. In many hospitals, entire wards, including some psychiatric wards, have been reorganized to admit patients with COVID-19, and many physicians and nurses have been diverted to wards managing patients with COVID-19. Most day facilities for patients with psychiatric needs have been temporarily closed, whereas in residential facilities, patients who usually are free to come and go during the day have had to be confined in the facilities with very limited or no leave. These changes have produced considerable stresses on people with severe mental disorders. Many outpatient clinics have limited appointments to those with the most urgent cases, and home visits, a common practice in most DMHAs, have been drastically reduced with potentially detrimental consequences for patients' well-being. Another potential detrimental consequence of being forced to stay at home has been an increase in the hours spent face to face with families with high amounts of conflict. Conclusions and Relevance: Departments of Mental Health need to be equipped with appropriate e-health technologies and procedures to cope with situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, interventions are needed to mitigate the potentially harmful consequences of quarantine. Departments of Mental Health should be able to assume a leadership position in the psychosocial management of disasterlike situations, and this requires the acquisition of new skills, notably how to correctly inform the population about risk, train and disseminate effective preventive and management procedures for disasters, support health personnel and rescuers, and support those experiencing bereavement.","de Girolamo, Giovanni; Cerveri, Giancarlo; Clerici, Massimo; Monzani, Emiliano; Spinogatti, Franco; Starace, Fabrizio; Tura, Giambattista; Vita, Antonio",JAMA Psychiatry,,295

METHODS: A case-control study in 32 individuals with RA, 28 with SLE, and 29 in the control group (CG). The questionnaire SF-36 (Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36) was used to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and OHIP-14 (Oral Health Impact Profile-14) was used to evaluate the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). The severity of xerostomia was evaluated by the Xerostomia Inventory (XI). In the clinical examination, decayed (D-T), missing(M-T), and filled teeth (F-T) (DMF-T), periodontal status, plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), unstimulated whole salivary flow rate (UWSFR), and stimulated whole salivary flow rate (SWSFR) were also assessed. Data were analyzed by Student's t tests, chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, and Spearman's correlation. RESULTS: Individuals with RA had a higher caries index (D-T/p = 0.004) and more frequent periodontal disease (PI/p = 0.017). In the SLE group, there was a significant lower salivary flow (SFR/p = 0.016, SFMS/p = 0.004) and severe xerostomia (p = 0.002). The impact of ORHQoL in individuals with RA occurred due to oral candidiasis, halitosis, and xerostomia, compromising the HRQoL. Overall, OHRQoL and HRQoL were more compromised in individuals with SLE, with xerostomia being the main oral problem. CONCLUSION: Individuals with RA and SLE present oral diseases with negative impact on their QoL. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study shows the main oral manifestations in rheumatic autoimmune diseases, with mainly xerostomia compromising the quality of life.","Manzano, Brena Rodrigues; da Silva Santos, Paulo Sérgio; Bariquelo, Matheus Henrique; Merlini, Nathália Rodrigues Germano; Honório, Heitor Marques; Rubira, Cássia Maria Fischer",,,295
414583,Characterization of Bacterial and Fungal Infections in Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Factors Associated With Health Care-Associated Infections,2021,"BACKGROUND: A major problem in quantifying symptoms of schizophrenia is establishing a reliable distinction between enduring and dynamic aspects of psychopathology. This is critical for accurate diagnosis, monitoring and evaluating treatment effects in both clinical practice and trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied Generalisability Theory, a robust novel method to distinguish between dynamic and stable aspects of schizophrenia symptoms in the widely used Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) using a longitudinal measurement design. The sample included 107 patients with chronic schizophrenia assessed using the PANSS at five time points over a 24-week period during a multi-site clinical trial of N-Acetylcysteine as an add-on to maintenance medication for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia. RESULTS: The original PANSS and its three subscales demonstrated good reliability and generalisability of scores (G=0.77-0.93) across sample population and occasions making them suitable for assessment of psychosis risks and long-lasting change following a treatment, while subscales of the five factor models appeared less reliable. The most enduring symptoms represented by the PANSS were poor attention, delusions, blunted affect, and poor rapport. More dynamic symptoms with 40-50% of variance explained by patient transient state including grandiosity, preoccupation, somatic concerns, guilt feeling and hallucinatory behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Identified dynamic symptoms are more amendable to change and should be the primary target of interventions aiming at effectively treating schizophrenia. Separating out the dynamic symptoms would increase assay sensitivity in trials, reduce the signal to noise ratio and increase the potential to detect the effects of novel therapies in clinical trials.","Medvedev, Oleg N; Berk, Michael; Dean, Olivia M; Brown, Ellie; Sandham, Margaret H; Dipnall, Joanna F; McNamara, Robert K; Sumich, Alexander; Krägeloh, Christian U; Narayanan, Ajit; Siegert, Richard J",Eur J Clin Invest,,295

418144,Geospatial Distribution and Predictors of Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Cohort Study,2020,"Objective: Recently emerged beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in the current pandemic designated COVID-19. COVID-19 manifests as severe illness exhibiting systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thrombotic events, and shock, exacerbated further by co-morbidities and age. Recent clinical evidence suggests that the development of ARDS and subsequent pulmonary failure result from a complex interplay between cell types (endothelial, epithelial and immune) within the lung promoting inflammatory infiltration and a pro-coagulative state. How the complex molecular events mediated by SARS-CoV-2 in infected lung epithelial cells lead to thrombosis and pulmonary failure, is yet to be fully understood. Methods: We address these questions here, using publicly available transcriptomic data in the context of lung epithelia affected by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections, in vitro. We then extend our results to the understanding of in vivo lung, using a publicly available COVID-19 lung transcriptomic study. Results and Conclusions: Our analysis indicates that there exists a complex interplay between the fibrinolytic system particularly plasmin, and the complement and platelet-activating systems upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a potential for therapeutic intervention.","Kavitha, Mukund Mathee Kalai Subramaniam Shankar",IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology,,295

Despite being one of the most unequal regions of the world, there is a scarce report of the effect of socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 mortality in their countries. We aimed to identify the effect of some socioeconomic inequality-related factors on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia. METHODS: We conducted a survival analysis in a nation-wide retrospective cohort study of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Colombia from 2 March 2020 to 26 October 2020. We calculated the time to death or recovery for each confirmed case in the cohort. We used an extended multivariable time-dependent Cox regression model to estimate the HR by age groups, sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance, area of residence and socioeconomic strata. RESULTS: There were 1 033 218 confirmed cases and 30 565 deaths for COVID-19 in Colombia between 2 March and 26 October. The risk of dying for COVID-19 among confirmed cases was higher in males (HR 1.68 95% CI 1.64 to 1.72), in people older than 60 years (HR 296.58 95% CI 199.22 to 441.51), in indigenous people (HR 1.20 95% CI 1.08 to 1.33), in people with subsidised health insurance regime (HR 1.89 95% CI 1.83 to 1.96) and in people living in the very low socioeconomic strata (HR 1.44 95% CI 1.24 to 1.68).

425269,Case Report: One Case of Coronavirus Desease 2019(COVID-19) in Patient Co-nfected by HIV With a Low CD4+ T Cell Count,2020,"The health awareness that has arisen from the COVID pandemic has been translated into inter-est in studying the contagion methods of airborne viruses. The cough mechanism is one cause of virion spread. To analyze this phenomenon, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the human cough have been set up in closed room conditions. Fundamental droplet, air, and thermody-namic conditions for the problem have been extracted from the literature and applied to the simu-lations performed. Three typologies of cough have been computed corresponding to the maximum, minimum, and mean peak cough velocities of the human being, and their corresponding injection profiles. Coughs were simulated in transient conditions and the droplets were tracked following an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach and large eddy simulation (LES) formulation for the turbulence phe-nomenon. Results revealed droplet travel distances of almost 2 m for the strongest cough case. Also, the presence of droplets smaller than 5 mu m of diameter, the main virus spreader, was considerably larger than particles of bigger size. Additionally, most of the droplets evaporate or fall to the ground within 2 s after their injection.

Moreover, it was found how almost the totality of the droplets expelled followed a trajectory towards the floor. Droplets that did not evaporate during the fluid injection became airborne for at least 5 seconds after the coughing.","Payri, R.; Marti-Aldaravi, P.; Quintero, P.

426559,Serum Amyloid A is a biomarker of severe Coronavirus Disease and poor prognosis,2020,"Until a vaccine or therapy is found against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, reaching herd immunity appears to be the only mid-term option. However, if the number of infected individuals decreases and eventually fades only beyond this threshold, a significant proportion of susceptible may still be infected until the epidemic is over. A containment strategy is likely the best policy in the worst case where no vaccine or therapy is found. In order to keep the number of newly infected persons to a minimum, a possible strategy is to apply strict containment measures, so that the number of susceptible individuals remains close to herd immunity. Such an action is unrealistic since containment can only last for a finite amount of time and is never total. In this article, using a classical SIR model, we determine the (partial or total) containment strategy on a given finite time interval that maximizes the number of susceptible individuals over an infinite horizon, or equivalently that minimizes the total infection burden during the curse of the epidemic. The existence and uniqueness of the optimal strategy is proved and the latter is fully characterized. If applicable in practice, such a strategy would lead theoretically to an increase by 30% of the proportion of susceptible on an infinite horizon, for a containment level corresponding to the sanitary measures put in place in France from March to May 2020. We also analyze the minimum intervention time to reach a fixed distance from herd immunity, and show the relationship with the previous problem. Simulations are provided that illustrate and validate the theoretical results.","Bliman, Pierre-Alexandre; Duprez, Michel; Privat, Yannick; Vauchelet, Nicolas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05733v1.pdf,295

As global trade is growing, goods and individuals are expected to travel across the border, an infected epidemic area carrier can pose a great danger to his hostile. If a disease outbreak is recognized promptly, then commercial products and travelers (traders/visitors) will be effectively vaccinated, and therefore the disease stopped.

Few early warning outbreak systems exist with some limitation of linguistic (Urdu) and covering areas (Pakistan). In Pakistan, few channels are published the outbreak news in Urdu or English. The aim is to procure information from Pakistan's English and Urdu news channels and then investigate process, integrate, and visualize the disease epidemic.

429574,First Test of an Automated Detection Platform to Identify Risk of Decompensation in Elderly Patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Evaluate risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries during the pandemic's early phase. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study covering Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries. We separated out elderly residents in nursing homes (NH) and those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) from the primary study population of individuals ages &#8805;65. Outcomes included COVID-19 hospital encounters and COVID-19-associated deaths. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) using logistic regression. RESULTS: We analyzed 25,333,329 elderly non-NH non-ESRD beneficiaries, 653,966 elderly NH residents, and 292,302 ESRD patients. COVID-related death rates (per 10,000) were much higher among elderly NH residents (275.7) and ESRD patients (60.8) than the primary study population (5.0). Regression-adjusted clinical predictors of death among the primary population included immunocompromised status (OR: 1.43), frailty index conditions such as cognitive impairment (3.16) as well as other comorbidities including congestive heart failure (1.30). Demographics-related risk factors included male sex (1.77), older age (OR: 3.09 for 80-year-old vs. 65-year-old), Medicaid dual-eligibility status (2.17) and racial/ethnic minority. Compared to Whites, ORs were higher for Blacks (2.47), Hispanics (3.11), and Native Americans (5.82). Results for COVID-19 hospital encounters were consistent. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, comorbidities, and race/ethnicity were strong risk factors of COVID-19 hospitalization and death among the U.S. elderly.","Izurieta, Hector S; Graham, David J; Jiao, Yixin; Hu, Mao; Lu, Yun; Wu, Yue; Chillarige, Yoganand; Wernecke, Michael; Menis, Mikhail; Pratt, Douglas; Kelman, Jeffrey; Forshee, Richard",,,295

Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 50% of patients with secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a hyperinflammatory syndrome characterised by a surge of cytokines, including interleukin 6 (IL-6). Here we describe the case of the first patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia successfully treated with tocilizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor, in the UK. Early treatment (after 7-10 days from the onset of symptoms) with tocilizumab could (1) reduce the risk of requiring non-invasive or invasive ventilation; (2) offer a chance of survival to people who are not fit for escalation or have refused to be ventilated; and (3) potentially increase the chance of survival in some patients who are already ventilated but fail to improve with supportive treatment.","Gentile, Giorgio; Davies, Rebecca; Manfreda, Valeria Maria; Ul Abideen, Zain",BMJ case reports,,295

434935,Prophylactic anticoagulation: comment on the American College of Rheumatology Guidance for Management of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children,2021,"The early detection of infection is significant for the fight against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is an efficient screening technique via which lung infections can be detected. This paper aims to distinguish COVID-19 positive cases from the other four classes, including normal, tuberculosis (TB), bacterial pneumonia (BP), and viral pneumonia (VP), using CXR images. The existing COVID-19 classification researches have achieved some successes with deep learning techniques while sometimes lacking interpretability and generalization ability. Hence, we propose a two-stage classification method MANet to address these issues in computer-aided COVID-19 diagnosis. Particularly, a segmentation model predicts the masks for all CXR images to extract their lung regions at the first stage. A followed classification CNN at the second stage then classifies the segmented CXR images into five classes based only on the preserved lung regions. In this segment-based classification task, we propose the mask attention mechanism (MA) which uses the predicted masks at the first stage as spatial attention maps to adjust the features of the CNN at the second stage. The MA spatial attention maps for features calculate the percentage of masked pixels in their receptive fields, suppressing the feature values based on the overlapping rates between their receptive fields and the segmented lung regions. In evaluation, we segment out the lung regions of all CXR images through a UNet with ResNet backbone, and then perform classification on the segmented CXR images using four classic CNNs with or without MA, including ResNet34, ResNet50, VGG16, and Inceptionv3. The experimental results illustrate that the classification models with MA have higher classification accuracy, more stable training process, and better interpretability and generalization ability than those without MA. Among the evaluated classification models, ResNet50 with MA achieves the highest average test accuracy of 96.32 % in three runs, and the highest one is 97.06 % . Meanwhile, the attention heat maps visualized by Grad-CAM indicate that models with MA make more reliable predictions based on the pathological patterns in lung regions. This further presents the potential of MANet to provide clinicians with diagnosis assistance.","Xu, Yujia; Lam, Hak-Keung; Jia, Guangyu",,,295
436662,Excess deaths associated with the Iranian COVID-19 epidemic: A province-level analysis,2021,"Genetically engineered (GE) maize has been thoroughly studied regarding its agro-environmental impact; however, its concerns for the soil environment remain. This work was aimed to decode rhizosphere microbe interactions and potential ecological hazards associated with GE maize. Rhizobacterial communities of field grown transgenic insect-resistant 2A5 maize carrying mcry1Ab and mcry2Ab genes were compared with control Z58 using PacBio sequencing platform. Also full-length 16S rDNA gene sequencing was used to verify the partial (V3-V4) sequencing results obtained in 2017. Measures of &#945;-diversity displayed transgenic 2A5 to be significantly lower in species richness at the flowering stage; however, diversity remained undisturbed. ß-diversity was least affected by genetic modifications where similar community profiles were shared by transgenic 2A5 and control Z58. In addition, root exudation patterns were found to drive variations in bacterial assemblages based on developmental stages. For example, genus Massilia successfully colonized the rhizosphere at jointing stage, while Mucilaginobacter showed higher relative abundance in flowering stages of both 2A5 and Z58. These members are known to possess attributes related to plant growth. The impact of dual-transgene insertion on nifH gene abundance was also analyzed where no apparent significant difference in nifH gene copy number was observed. Our results confirmed that full-length 16S rDNA sequencing was sufficient to provide higher taxonomic resolution. Also, results of our 2-year field trials confirmed that there is no significant impact of mcry gene integration on belowground biomasses. Therefore, GE insect-resistant 2A5 maize carrying mcry1Ab and mcry2Ab genes can continue to benefit human populations by increasing crop productivity. In future, further research needs to be catalyzed to analyze the impact of Bt-insertion on microbial community structure across the years for ecosystem sustainability.","Fazal, Aliya; Wen, Zhongling; Yang, Minkai; Liao, Yonghui; Fu, Jiangyan; He, Cong; Wang, Xuan; Jie, Wencai; Ali, Farman; Hu, Dongqing; Yin, Tongming; Hong, Zhi; Lu, Guihua; Qi, Jinliang; Yang, Yonghua",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Motivated by the use of CT imaging at clinical institutes around the world as an effective complementary screening method to RT-PCR testing, we introduced COVID-Net CT, a neural network tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images as part of the open source COVID-Net initiative. However, one potential limiting factor is restricted quantity and diversity given the single nation patient cohort used. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net CT-2, enhanced deep neural networks for COVID-19 detection from chest CT images trained on the largest quantity and diversity of multinational patient cases in research literature. We introduce two new CT benchmark datasets, the largest comprising a multinational cohort of 4,501 patients from at least 15 countries. We leverage explainability to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVID-Net CT-2, with the results for select cases reviewed and reported on by two board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 30 years of experience, respectively. The COVID-Net CT-2 neural networks achieved accuracy, COVID-19 sensitivity, PPV, specificity, and NPV of 98.1%/96.2%/96.7%/99%/98.8% and 97.9%/95.7%/96.4%/98.9%/98.7%, respectively. Explainability-driven performance validation shows that COVID-Net CT-2's decision-making behaviour is consistent with radiologist interpretation by leveraging correct, clinically relevant critical factors. The results are promising and suggest the strong potential of deep neural networks as an effective tool for computer-aided COVID-19 assessment. While not a production-ready solution, we hope the open-source, open-access release of COVID-Net CT-2 and benchmark datasets will continue to enable researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to build upon them.","Gunraj, Hayden; Sabri, Ali; Koff, David; Wong, Alexander",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07433v2.pdf,295

Systematic review elaborated according to the PRISMA method. We searched at PubMed; Scielo and Lilacs databases, and studies that used methods of assessing the availability of food at home were included. In the end, 19 papers composed the review. Food availability was predominantly assessed for a seven days period and from a single data measurement. Other variables were also observed in the studies, such as socio-demographic data and expenditure on food. Among the limitations to assess the food availability at home, we can highlight the difficulty in measuring the food distribution among family members and the lack of information on the variability of this availability. Such assessment can be improved by investigating the strengths and weaknesses of the instruments for greater detail and accuracy of the information. We recommend the development and validation of specific instruments capable of effectively measure the food availability at the household level.","Schott, Eloise; Rezende, Fabiane Aparecida Canaan; Priore, Silvia Eloiza; Ribeiro, Andréia Queiroz; Franceschini, Sylvia do Carmo Castro",Ciênc.

The policies and support systems designed by host governments highlight the lack of social justice and raise concerns for scholarly attention. Considering the experiences of international migrants living in the UK during the Covid-19 lockdown from the theoretical perspective of coping, this interpretivist study investigates international migrants? coping strategies adopted during the first UK national lockdown. Data collected from 60 Chinese, Italian and Iranian migrants using semi-structured interviews during the lockdown period were analysed thematically using NVivo. The findings show that migrants adopted multi-layered and multi-phase coping strategies. To cope with the anxiety and uncertainties caused by the pandemic, they initiated new practices informed by both home and host institution logics. Nevertheless, the hostile context's responses provoked unexpected new worries and triggered the adoption of additional and compromising practices. The paper illustrates how coping became paradoxical because migrants had to cope with the hostile reactions that their initial coping strategies provoked in the host environment. By introducing the new concept of coping with coping, this paper extends previous theoretical debate and leads to several managerial implications for governments and policymakers.","Yen, Dorothy Ai-wan Cappellini Benedetta Yang Hsiao-Pei Gupta Suraksha",British Journal of Management,,295
449943,"Coronavirus disease 2019 and asthma, allergic rhinitis: molecular mechanisms and host-environmental interactions",2020,"BACKGROUND: Adolescents' health-related behavior varies from weekday to weekend. Only few studies, however, have examined to which degree such variation will affect markers of cardiometabolic health. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to examine if markers of cardiometabolic health differ between different days of the week in adolescents. METHODS: This cross-sectional school-based study included up to 581 participants, 11-17 years old. Markers of metabolic health were insulin, glucose, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood pressure. Linear mixed regression modelling was used to examine the cardiometabolic profile across weekdays. RESULTS: Significant declining trends were observed across the week in adolescents' levels of cardiometabolic health markers. Lower levels of insulin (16.1%), glucose (2.6%) and triglyceride (24.7%) were observed on Fridays compared to Mondays (p &#8804; 0.006). Gradual improvement in measurement profiles across weekdays was less apparent for HDL-C, LDL-C, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (P &#8805; 0.06). Analyses stratified by sex suggested a more noticeable pattern of gradual improvement across weekdays in boys than in girls. CONCLUSION: Significantly lower levels of insulin, glucose and triglyceride were observed in adolescents on Fridays compared to Mondays. However, when sex specific analyses were performed significant profile variations were only observed across the week in boys. More research is needed to better understand which behavioral factors in particular seem to influence weekly variation in markers of cardiometabolic health - especially since such variation potentially will have an impact on how assessments of markers of cardiometabolic health optimally should be planned, standardized and carried out, both in research and in medical practice.","Hansen, Louise Sølund; Pedersen, Marlene Rosager Lund; Tarp, Jakob; Bugge, Anna; Wedderkopp, Niels; Møller, Niels Christian",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,,295

RESULTS: A total of 92 patients (61.9% males; age 70.5 [13.3] years) were enrolled. Patients with overweight and obesity were younger than patients with normal weight (68.0 [12.6] and 67.0 [12.6] years vs. 76.1 [13.0] years, P < 0.01). A higher need for assisted ventilation beyond pure oxygen support (invasive mechanical ventilation or noninvasive ventilation) and a higher admission to intensive or semi-intensive care units were observed in patients with overweight and obesity (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) even after adjusting for sex, age, and comorbidities (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively) or when patients with dementia or advanced cancer were removed from the analysis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with overweight and obesity admitted in a medical ward for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related pneumonia, despite their younger age, required more frequently assisted ventilation and access to intensive or semi-intensive care units than normal weight patients.","Busetto, Luca; Bettini, Silvia; Fabris, Roberto; Serra, Roberto; Dal Pra, Chiara; Maffei, Pietro; Rossato, Marco; Fioretto, Paola; Vettor, Roberto",Obesity (Silver Spring),,295

451527,Report on the treatment process and impact of mechanical thrombectomy before and after coronavirus disease in a newly opened hospital of South Korea,2021,"Treatment with anti-neoplastic agents, including cyclophosphamide (CP), is associated with several adverse reactions. Here, we distinguished the potential protective effect of allicin against CP-mediated hepatotoxicity in rats. To assess the effect of allicin, four experimental groups were used, with 7 rats per group, including control, allicin (10 mg/kg), CP (200 mg/kg), and allicin + CP-treated groups. All groups were treated for 10 days. Blood and liver samples were collected for biochemical, molecular, and histological analyses. Treatment with CP led to deformations in the liver tissue that were associated with higher liver function markers (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase). Additionally, a disturbance in the redox balance was observed after CP exposure, as indicated by increased levels of oxidants, including malondialdehyde and nitric oxide, and the decreased levels of endogenous antioxidants, including glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. At the molecular level, CP treatment resulted in reduced expression of the Nrf2/ARE pathway and other genes related to this pathway, including NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit. CP also led to a hyper-inflammatory response in hepatic tissue, with increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interlukin-1beta, and upregulation of nitric oxide synthase 2. CP also enhanced the immunoreactivity of the profibrogenic cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta, in liver tissue. Upregulation of caspase 3 and Bcl-2-associated X protein and downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 were also observed in response to CP treatment. Treatment with allicin reversed the molecular, biochemical, and histological changes that occurred with CP exposure. These results suggest that allicin can be used in combination with CP to avoid hepatotoxicity.","Sun, Dongsheng; Sun, Chen; Qiu, Gongcai; Yao, Lei; Yu, Jian; Al Sberi, Hassan; Fouda, Manar S; Othman, Mohamed S; Lokman, Maha S; Kassab, Rami B; Abdel Moneim, Ahmed E",,,295

Here, we developed and applied a multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay (MMIA) for COVD-19 antibody studies that incorporates spike protein trimers of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and the seasonal human betacoronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, that enables measurement of off-target pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies. The MMIA performances characteristics are: 98% sensitive and 100% specific for human subject samples collected as early as 10 days from symptom onset. The MMIA permitted the simultaneous identification of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and the induction of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody cross reactions to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Further, synchronous increases of HCoV-OC43 IgG antibody levels was detected with SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in a subset of subjects for whom early infection sera were available prior to their SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, suggestive of an HCoV-OC43 memory response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Laing, Eric; Sterling, Spencer; Richard, Stephanie; Epsi, Nusrat; Phogat, Shreshta; Samuels, Emily; Yan, Lianying; Moreno, Nicole; Coles, Christian; Drew, Matthew; Mehalko, Jennifer; English, Caroline; Merritt, Scott; Mende, Katrin; Chung, Kevin; Clifton, G; Munster, Vincent; de Wit, Emmie; Tribble, David; Agan, Brian; Esposito, Dominic; Lanteri, Charlotte; Mitre, Edward; Burgess, Timothy; Broder, Chritopher",,,295
456196,2. Median Income is Associated with Need for Mechanical Ventilation in COVID-19,2020,"The year 2020 witnessed an unpredictable pandemic situation due to novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreaks. This condition can be more severe if the patient has comorbidities. Failure of viable treatment for such viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is due to lack of identification. Thus, modern and productive biotechnology-based tools are being used to manipulate target genes by introducing the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) system. Moreover, it has now been used as a tool to inhibit viral replication. Hence, it can be hypothesized that the CRISPR/Cas system can be a viable tool to target both the SARS-CoV-2 genome with specific target RNA sequence and host factors to destroy the SARS-CoV-2 community via inhibition of viral replication and infection. Moreover, comorbidities and COVID-19 escalate the rate of mortality globally, and as a result, we have faced this pandemic. CRISPR/Cas-mediated genetic manipulation to knockdown viral sequences may be a preventive strategy against such pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells (PAC-MAN) along with CRISPR/Cas13d efficiently degrades the specific RNA sequence to inhibit viral replication. Therefore, we suggest that CRISPR/Cas system with PAC-MAN could be a useful tool to fight against such a global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. This is an alternative preventive approach of management against the pandemic to destroy the target sequence of RNA in SARS-CoV-2 by viral inhibition.","Banerjee, Arnab; Mukherjee, Sandip; Maji, Bithin K",Exp Biol Med (Maywood),,295

Two models are estimated: one with a sample covering post-lockdown period only and another spanning both post-lockdown and post-reopening periods. The first model reveals that the lockdown caused an immediate fall in the daily growth rate of the ACC by 14.30% and 33.26% fall in the long run. The parameters of the second model show that the lockdown had an impact effect of 8.56% and steady state effect of 20.88% reduction in the growth rate of the ACC. The effect of reopening on the ACC is insignificant. However, the doubling time of the ACC has increased after reopening. The study warns against complete reopening until sufficient post-reopening data series is available for exact estimation. The findings in this study can be useful in determining the hospitalisation needs and effectiveness of similar health-related policies.","Mati, Sagiru",Soc Sci Med,,295

COVID-19 affected over 200 countries and territories worldwide, with 25,541,380 confirmed cases and 852,000 deaths associated with COVID-19 globally, as of September 1, 2020.1 While facing such a public health emergency, hospitals were on the front line to deliver health care and psychological services. The early detection, diagnosis, reporting, isolation, and clinical management of patients during a public health emergency required the extensive involvement of hospitals in all aspects. The response capacity of hospitals directly determined the outcomes of the prevention and control of an outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost all nations and territories regardless of their development level or geographic location, although suitable risk mitigation measures differ between developing and developed countries. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the consequences of the pandemic could be more complicated because incidence and mortality might be associated more with a fragile health care system and shortage of related resources.2, 3 As evidenced by the situation in Bangladesh, India, Kenya, South Africa, and other LMICs, socioeconomic status (SES) disparity was a major factor in the spread of disease, potentially leading to alarmingly insufficient preparedness and responses in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.4 Conversely, the pandemic might also bring more unpredictable socioeconomic and long-term impacts in LMICs, and those with lower SES fare worse in these situations. This review aimed to summarize the responsibilities of and measures taken by hospitals in combatting the COVID-19 outbreak. Our findings are hoped to provide experiences, as well as lessons and potential implications for LMICs.","Zhang, Ji; Lu, Xinpu; Jin, Yinzi; Zheng, Zhijie",,,295

This study aims to systematically review the evidence for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. MethodsThis review is part of an Open Evidence Review on the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the role of intrauterine mother to fetus transmission. Literature searches were performed in the WHO Covid-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, and Google Scholar for SARS-CoV-2 using keywords and associated synonyms, search date up to 20 December 2020, no language restrictions. ResultsWe included 106 studies assessing vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from pregnant women to their neonates: these studies comprised 40 reviews (21 fulfilled systematic review methodology, including risk of bias assessment of included studies) and 66 primary studies including 32 case reports (of up to two cases) and 34 prospective and retrospective cohort studies, prospective and retrospective case series, observational studies (including asymptomatic screening), database studies and a quality improvement project. Almost all were conducted in a hospital setting. The 32 case reports were considered to be at high risk of bias, due to the study design; across the 34 remaining primary studies, risk of bias was low to moderate. Sixteen case reports examined vertical transmission, which was not related to maternal symptomatology. For the cohort and case series studies, the percentage of positive neonates ranged from 0% to 22% across the studies. Twenty studies reported no positive vertical transmission. Three studies that reported the highest positivity rates of 11%, 15% and 22% had specifically selected neonates with a positive test (within up to 35 days) within the study population and were therefore more selective populations. Across the cohort and case series studies there were 65/2391 (2.7%) neonates born to mothers with a diagnosis of COVID-19 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 24 hours of birth. No evidence correlated maternal symptomatology to vertical transmission. Mode of delivery did not correlate with rates of vertical transmission. Of 25 studies, 7 identified SARS-CoV-2 in placental tissue; some of these did not demonstrate vertical transmission to the neonate. No study reported the results of viral culture to detect SARS-CoV-2. ConclusionsThe results of these studies indicate that vertical transmission is possible, but is not frequent, and factors that influence when vertical transmission occurs are unknown. Further studies using standardised methods to establish viral infection are needed to establish vertical transmission rates and to assess clinical and other conditions affecting transmission.","Pluddemann, Annette; Spencer, Elizabeth A; Heneghan, Carl; Brassey, Jon; Onakpoya, Igho J; Rosca, Elena Cecilia; Evans, David H; Conly, John M; Jefferson, Tom",,,295

The magnetostrictive interaction enables the coupling between a magnon mode (spin wave) and a mechanical mode in the ferrimagnet, and the magnon mode simultaneously couples to two microwave cavity fields via the magnetic dipole interaction. The magnon-phonon coupling is enhanced by directly driving the ferrimagnet with a strong red-detuned microwave field, and the driving photons are scattered onto two sidebands induced by the mechanical motion. We show that two cavity fields can be prepared in a stationary entangled state if they are, respectively, resonant with two mechanical sidebands. The present scheme illustrates a new mechanism for creating entangled states of optical fields and enables potential applications in quantum information science and quantum tasks that require entangled microwave fields.","Yu, Mei; Shen, Heng; Li, Jie",Phys Rev Lett,,295

Karonudib (TH1579) was developed to inhibit MTH1, an enzyme preventing oxidized dNTP-incorporation in DNA. MTH1 is highly upregulated in tumor biopsies from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma, hence confirming a rationale for targeting MTH1. Here, we tested the efficacy of karonudib in vitro and in preclinical B-cell lymphoma models. Using a range of B-cell lymphoma cell lines, karonudib strongly reduced viability at concentrations well tolerated by activated normal B cells. In B-cell lymphoma cells, karonudib increased incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP into DNA, and prominently induced prometaphase arrest and apoptosis due to failure in spindle assembly. MTH1 knockout cell lines were less sensitive to karonudib-induced apoptosis, but were displaying cell cycle arrest phenotype similar to the wild type cells, indicating a dual inhibitory role of the drug. Karonudib was highly potent as single agent in two different lymphoma xenograft models, including an ABC DLBCL patient derived xenograft, leading to prolonged survival and fully controlled tumor growth. Together, our preclinical findings provide a rationale for further clinical testing of karonudib in B-cell lymphoma.","Oksvold, Morten P; Berglund, Ulrika Warpman; Gad, Helge; Bai, Baoyan; Stokke, Trond; Rein, Idun Dale; Pham, Therese; Sanjiv, Kumar; Øy, Geir Frode; Norum, Jens Henrik; Smeland, Erlend B; Myklebust, June H; Helleday, Thomas; Våtsveen, Thea Kristin",Sci Rep,,295

471160,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes in People Living With Human Immunodeficiency Virus Hospitalized for Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"PURPOSE: After a long period of low utilization, droperidol has become easier to obtain in the US market. This comprehensive review discusses the safety, indications, clinical efficacy, and dosing of droperidol for use in the emergency department (ED) setting. SUMMARY: In 2001 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated a boxed warning in the labeling of droperidol after reports of QT interval prolongation associated with droperidol use. Since that time, it has been difficult to access droperidol in the United States; as a result, many practicing clinicians lack experience in its clinical use. Multiple studies have been conducted to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of droperidol use in ED patients. Results consistently show the safety of droperidol and its clinical efficacy when used as an analgesic, antiemetic, and sedative. Now that droperidol is more widely available for use in the US market, pharmacists and prescribers need to reliably translate safety and efficacy data compiled since 2001 to help ensure appropriate and effective use of the medication. CONCLUSION: Droperidol is an effective and safe option for the treatment of acute agitation, migraine, nausea, and pain for patients in the ED setting. Healthcare professionals can adopt droperidol for use in clinical practice, and they should become familiar with how to dose and monitor droperidol for safe and effective use.","Mattson, Alicia; Friend, Kimberly; Brown, Caitlin S; Cabrera, Daniel",Am. j. health system pharm,,295

The usual lopinavir trough plasma concentrations are 3000-8000â ng/mL. A trend towards a 28â day mortality reduction was observed in COVID-19-infected patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. OBJECTIVES: To assess the plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 infection included in the French COVID-19 cohort and treated with lopinavir/ritonavir were included. Lopinavir/ritonavir combination was administered using the usual adult HIV dose regimen (400/100â mg q12h, oral solution through a nasogastric tube). A half-dose reduction to 400/100â mg q24h was proposed if lopinavir Ctrough was >8000â ng/mL, the upper limit considered as toxic and reported in HIV-infected patients. Lopinavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters were determined after an intensive pharmacokinetic analysis. Biological markers of inflammation and liver/kidney function were monitored. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir were first assessed in eight patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. Median (IQR) lopinavir Ctrough reached 27â¯908â ng/mL (15â¯928-32â¯627). After the dose reduction to 400/100â mg q24h, lopinavir/ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed in nine patients. Lopinavir Ctrough decreased to 22â¯974â ng/mL (21â¯394-32â¯735). CONCLUSIONS: In mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 infections, the oral administration of lopinavir/ritonavir elicited plasma exposure of lopinavir more than 6-fold the upper usual expected range. However, it remains difficult to safely recommend its dose reduction without compromising the benefit of the antiviral strategy, and careful pharmacokinetic and toxicity monitoring are needed.","Lê, Minh Patrick; Jaquet, Pierre; Patrier, Juliette; Wicky, Paul-Henri; Le Hingrat, Quentin; Veyrier, Marc; Kauv, Juliette; Sonneville, Romain; Visseaux, Benoit; Laouénan, Cédric; Bouadma, Lila; Descamps, Diane; de Montmollin, Etienne; Peytavin, Gilles; Timsit, Jean-François",J Antimicrob Chemother,,295

The association of obesity and COVID-19 prognosis may be related to many different factors, such as chronic systemic inflammation, the predisposition to severe respiratory conditions and viral infections. The ketogenic diet is an approach that can be extremely effective in reducing body weight and visceral fat in the short term, preserving the lean mass and reducing systemic inflammation. Therefore, it is a precious preventive measure for severely obese people and may be considered as an adjuvant therapy for patients with respiratory compromise.","Gangitano, Elena; Tozzi, Rossella; Gandini, Orietta; Watanabe, Mikiko; Basciani, Sabrina; Mariani, Stefania; Lenzi, Andrea; Gnessi, Lucio; Lubrano, Carla",Nutrients,,295

Numerous viruses are susceptible to contaminate crops during growth, harvesting, handling, marketing and minimally processing, and these steps share one common factor which is human. Different studies showed that viruses might persist on different crops for periods of 2 to 14 days under different conditions such as refrigeration, household and freezing. Little is known on SARS-CoV-2, but preliminary studies showed that this virus might survive 24 hr on cardboard and 72 hr on plastic, materials used in fruits and vegetables packaging. Based on preliminary data, there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Certainly, to date there is no scientific evidence that SARS-CoV-2 might be transmitted by a contact with, or the ingestion of contaminated fresh or minimally processed fruits and vegetables. However, this risk even though being considered improbable, it cannot be ""completely and definitely"" discarded or ignored, particularly where the virus is spreading in the word. Some agencies indicated that in case some commodities and handlers are contaminated among the multiple people involved from the farm to the table, a cross-contamination may occur, and the risk of the contamination of food, food contact materials, and packaging from infected but asymptomatic workers should not be discarded even though considered ""Very Low = meaning very rare but cannot be excluded.""","Benkeblia, Noureddine",J Food Saf,,295
475703,"COVID-19 and maternal, fetal and neonatal mortality: a systematic review",2020,"Background: Informed consent (IC) is linked to the ethical principle of respecting patient autonomy, respect for human rights and ethical practice, while in many countries it is a standard procedure. Anecdotally, it should be noted that in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in many instances ICs are not obtained systematically. To date, no research appears to have been conducted on this matter. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practice of obtaining IC from patients among health care providers (HCP) in the DRC. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, with a convenient sampling of 422 participants. Data from the questions were collected on an imported Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for review at INSTAT.TM The authors set IC's accurate knowledge and practice at 80% or higher. The Fisher Exact test was used to compare categorical association results, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Results showed that giving information in detail to patients on their medical condition was associated with formal training on medical ethics and IC (p: 0.0028; OR: 1.894; CI: 1.246 to 2.881), which was also associated with answering the patient's questions in detail (p: 0.0035; OR: 1.852; CI: 1.236 to 2.774). About 127(30.09 %) of participants scored 80% or higher. Extracurricular training was associated with withholding information from patients, up to 27 times more than other factors (p< 0.0001; OR: 27.042; CI: 13.628 to 53.657). when it comes to get IC, HCP with many years of practice scored better than others, in one of the question the odd ratio was closer to 7 (p< 0.0001; OR: 6.713; CI: 4.352 to 10.356). Only 47(11.14%) of the participants scored 80% or more of the questions about practice of IC. Conclusion: For a variety of reasons, knowledge and practice of IC among HCPs was very low. A common programme for the country as part of formal training might lead to an improvement. In addition, patients' education on IC should be displayed in waiting areas at all medical centres.","Nzaumvila, Doudou; Ntotolo, Patrick; Govender, Indiran; Lukanu, Philip; Niati, Jd Landu; Sanduku, Didier; Bongongo, Tombo",Afr Health Sci,,295

This initiative is a group process that attempts to bring Advance Care Planning (ACP) into the public domain. It encourages participants to consider what matters to them in their living along with their hopes, preferences, and wishes for their final years and end-of-life care. An inductive, interpretive, and naturalistic approach allowed the researcher to study these phenomena in their natural setting i.e., the community. This qualitative study used 5 focus groups with 17 people and employed thematic data analysis to identify key themes. All participants in the HLD speak from a personal perspective irrespective of any professional background. It transpired that 16 respondents worked in health and social care, which subsequently became noteworthy in the findings. Three key themes were identified: (a) feeling emotionally safe enough to have such sensitive conversations is vital; (b) participating in the HLD process increases the confidence of those participants who worked in health and social care, to undertake ACP conversations and (c) planning ahead is a complex, staged process rather than a single record-making event. The Covid-19 pandemic crisis reinforced the need to upstream ACP initiatives such as the HLD, as the norm for everyone, since all of us will one day die. It is recommended that the HLD be incorporated within ACP training given that the experiential nature of it and the use of groups was reported to build confidence in facilitating ACP conversations. A virtual HLD process needs to be developed to adapt to restrictions on gatherings due to Covid 19.","Mc Kenna, Deirdre; O039,; Shea, Johanna; Tanner, Liz",J Soc Work End Life Palliat Care,,295

Objective: To confirm the previous finding that high-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate (with double the amount of amoxicillin) may be superior to standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate in adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This double-blind, comparative-effectiveness randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 26, 2018, through May 10, 2020, at the academic primary care internal medicine and pediatrics practice of Albany Medical Center, located in Cohoes, New York. Participants included adults aged 18 years or older who were prescribed amoxicillin plus clavulanate for acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosed in accordance with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Interventions: Amoxicillin 875 mg with clavulanate 125 mg plus either placebo (standard dose) or amoxicillin 875 mg (high dose) twice a day for 7 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy outcome was a global rating of ""a lot better"" or ""no symptoms"" at the end of 3 days of treatment using a Global Rating of Improvement scale, with outcomes ranging from 1 (a lot worse) to 6 (no symptoms). The primary adverse effect outcome was severe diarrhea at 3 or 10 days after the start of treatment. Results: At an unplanned interim analysis prompted by COVID-19 restrictions, 157 of a projected 240 participants had been enrolled (mean age, 48.5 [range, 18.7-84.0] years; 117 women [74.5%]), with 79 randomized to the standard dose and 78 to the high dose; 9 and 12, respectively, withdrew or were lost to follow-up before the assessment of the primary outcome. At day 3, 31 of 70 participants (44.3%) in the standard-dose group reported a global rating of ""a lot better"" or ""no symptoms,"" as did 24 of 66 (36.4%) in the high-dose group, for a difference of -7.9% (95% CI, -24.4% to 8.5%; P = .35).

We hypothesized that patients with severe COVID-19 infections would have outcomes worse than non-COVID-19 patients with multisystem organ failure. We tested this by comparing LTAC outcomes in patients having severe COVID-19 disease with patients without COVID-19 who required LTAC after critical illness. Methods: We conducted a chart review of the 275 COVID-19-positive patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care discharged from the Brigham and Women's hospital from January 1-July 31, 2020 and compared them to a cohort of 241 ICU patients requiring LTAC who are part of a quality improvement program to enhance care continuity (CC). Statistical analyses used Student-t tests and Chi-square analyses, with P &lt; 0.05 accepted as statistically significant. Results: 65 of 279 COVID-19 patients required LTAC, with 57 patients discharging to the same LTAC used for CC patients. Similar to prior reports, the proportion of Black (28%) and Hispanic (10%) patients were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater in COVID-19 patients compared to the CC patients (9% Black and 6% Hispanic). There were no differences between groups in the average patient age: COVID-19 patients (62 ±14.2) and CC patients (60 ±15) or the proportion of males: COVID-19 patients (37, 64%) compared to the CC patients (137, 57%). At transfer to LTAC, 25% CC patients but only 7% COVID-19 patients required mechanical ventilation (MV), although 90% of the COVID-19 patients had required MV during their acute hospitalization. After LTAC transfer, significantly (P &lt; 0.05) fewer COVID-19 patients (12%) compared to CC patients (28%) required readmission to an acute hospital within 30 days of the acute hospital discharge. Additionally, significantly more (P &lt; 0.05) COVID-19 patients (41, 71%) compared to CC patients (73, 30%) were discharged to home after LTAC. Conclusions: The low rates of early readmission and the high rates of home discharge in the COVID patients compared to the CC patients were unexpected and indicate that COVID-19 patients requiring LTAC have outcomes that are comparable, and possibly better than, similar patients without COVID-19. The possible contributing factors for improved outcomes in COVID-19 patients are unknown but may include a lower burden of comorbid disease in these patients and better pre-morbid functional status.","Haley, K.

485377,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Temporally Related to COVID-19: A Case Report From Saudi Arabia,2020,"BACKGROUND: To systematically review the literature about the association between systemic corticosteroid therapy (CST) and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, EBM Reviews, Scopus, Web of Science, and preprints up to July 20, 2020. We included observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCT) that assessed COVID-19 patients treated with CST. We pooled adjusted effect estimates of mortality and other outcomes using a random effect model, among studies at low or moderate risk for bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Out of 1067 citations screened for eligibility, one RCT and 19 cohort studies were included (16,977 hospitalized patients). Ten studies (1 RCT and 9 cohorts) with 10,278 patients examined the effect of CST on short term mortality. The pooled adjusted RR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.69-1.22, I2 = 81.94%). This effect was observed across all stages of disease severity. Four cohort studies examined the effect of CST on composite outcome of death, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation need. The pooled adjusted RR was 0.41(0.23-0.73, I2 = 78.69%). Six cohort studies examined the effect of CST on delayed viral clearance. The pooled adjusted RR was 1.47(95% CI 1.11-1.93, I2 = 43.38%). CONCLUSION: In this systematic review, as of July 2020, heterogeneous and low certainty cumulative evidence based on observational studies and one RCT suggests that CST was not associated with reduction in short-term mortality but possibly with a delay in viral clearance in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 of different severities. However, the discordant results between the single RCT and observational studies as well as the heterogeneity observed across observational studies, call for caution in using observational data and suggests the need for more RCTs to identify the clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients' population that could benefit from CST.","Tlayjeh, Haytham; Mhish, Olaa H; Enani, Mushira A; Alruwaili, Alya; Tleyjeh, Rana; Thalib, Lukman; Hassett, Leslie; Arabi, Yaseen M; Kashour, Tarek; Tleyjeh, Imad M",J Infect Public Health,,295

490471,Prevalence and impact of Clostridioides difficile infection among hospitalized patients with coranavirus disease 2019,2021,"The contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for COVID-19 disease, has infected over 27 million people across the globe within a few months. While literature on SARS-CoV-2 indicates that its transmission may occur predominantly via aerosolization of virus-laden droplets, the possibility of alternate routes of transmission and/or reinfection via the environment requires considerable scientific attention. This review aims to collate information on possible transmission routes of this virus, to ascertain its fate in the environment. Concomitant with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in faeces and saliva of infected patients, studies also indicated its occurrence in raw wastewater, primary sludge and river water. Therefore sewerage system could be a possible route of virus outbreak, a possible tool to assess viral community spread and future surveillance technique. Hence, this review looked into detection, occurrence and fate of SARS-CoV-2 during primary, secondary, and tertiary wastewater and water treatment processes based on published literature on SARS-CoV and other enveloped viruses. The review also highlights the need for focused research on occurrence and fate of SARS-CoV-2 in various environmental matrices. Utilization of this information in environmental transmission models developed for other enveloped and enteric viruses can facilitate risk assessment studies. Preliminary research efforts with SARS-CoV-2 and established scientific reports on other coronaviruses indicate that the threat of virus transmission from the aquatic environment may be currently non-existent. However, the presence of viral RNA in wastewater provides an early warning that highlights the need for effective sewage treatment to prevent a future outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.","Mohapatra, Sanjeeb; Menon, N Gayathri; Mohapatra, Gayatree; Pisharody, Lakshmi; Pattnaik, Aryamav; Menon, N Gowri; Bhukya, Prudhvi Lal; Srivastava, Manjita; Singh, Meenakshi; Barman, Muneesh Kumar; Gin, Karina Yew-Hoong; Mukherji, Suparna",Sci Total Environ,,295

We present a stealth labeling approach that can efficiently, and with high fidelity, generate RNA transcripts, through enzymatic incorporation of the triphosphate of tCO, a fluorescent tricyclic cytosine analogue. We demonstrate this by incorporation of tCO in up to 100% of the natural cytosine positions of a 1.2 kb mRNA encoding for the histone H2B fused to GFP (H2B:GFP). Spectroscopic characterization of this mRNA shows that the incorporation rate of tCO is similar to cytosine, which allows for efficient labeling and controlled tuning of labeling ratios for different applications. Using live cell confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we show that the tCO-labeled mRNA is efficiently translated into H2B:GFP inside human cells. Hence, we not only develop the use of fluorescent base analogue labeling of nucleic acids in live-cell microscopy but also, importantly, show that the resulting transcript is translated into the correct protein. Moreover, the spectral properties of our transcripts and their translation product allow for their straightforward, simultaneous visualization in live cells. Finally, we find that chemically transfected tCO-labeled RNA, unlike a state-of-the-art fluorescently labeled RNA, gives rise to expression of a similar amount of protein as its natural counterpart, hence representing a methodology for studying natural, unperturbed processing of mRNA used in RNA therapeutics and in vaccines, like the ones developed against SARS-CoV-2.","Baladi, Tom; Nilsson, Jesper R; Gallud, Audrey; Celauro, Emanuele; Gasse, Cécile; Levi-Acobas, Fabienne; Sarac, Ivo; Hollenstein, Marcel R; Dahlén, Anders; Esbjörner, Elin K; Wilhelmsson, L Marcus",J Am Chem Soc,,295

497396,Imaging of Multisystem Inflammatory Disease in Children (MIS-C) Associated With COVID-19,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a wide range of symptoms, including several unexpected symptoms such as loss of taste, skin changes, and eye problems. We recently observed patients with documented COVID-19 develop de novo severe genitourinary symptoms, most notably urinary frequency of &#8805; 13 episodes/24 h and nocturia &#8805; 4 episodes/night. We call these associated urinary symptoms COVID-19 associate cystitis (CAC). COVID-19 severity is associated with inflammation. We collected urine samples from COVID-19 patients, including patients with CAC, and found elevation of proinflammatory cytokines also in the urine. It has been previously shown that patients with urinary incontinence and ulcerative interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome have elevated urinary inflammatory cytokines compared to normal controls. We therefore hypothesize that CAC, with presentation of de novo severe urinary symptoms, can occur in COVID-19 and is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines that are released into the urine and/or expressed in the bladder. The most important implications of our hypothesis are: 1) Physician caring for COVID-19 patients should be aware of COVID-19 associate cystitis (CAC); 2) De novo urinary symptoms should be included in the symptom complex associated with COVID-19; and 3) COVID-19 inflammation may result in bladder dysfunction.","Lamb, Laura E; Dhar, Nivedita; Timar, Ryan; Wills, Melissa; Dhar, Sorabh; Chancellor, Michael B",Med Hypotheses,,295

However, it is not known how factors effecting symmetry discrimination in static patterns might affect temporal integration in dynamic patterns. One such feature is luminance polarity. Using dynamic stimuli with increasing temporal delay (SOA) between the onset of the first and second element in a symmetric pair, we investigated how four different luminance-polarity conditions affected the temporal integration of symmetric patterns. All four luminance polarity conditions showed similar upper temporal limits of approximately 60 ms. However psychophysical performance over all delay durations showed significantly higher symmetry thresholds for unmatched-polarity patterns at short delays, but also significantly less sensitivity to increasing temporal delay relative to matched-polarity patterns. These varying temporal windows are consistent with the involvement of a fast, sensitive first-order mechanism for matched-polarity patterns, and a slower, more robust second-order mechanism for unmatched-polarity patterns. Temporal integration windows for unmatched-polarity patterns were not consistent with performance expected from attentional mechanisms alone, and instead supports the involvement of second-order mechanisms that combines information from ON and OFF channels.","Bellagarda, Cayla A; Dickinson, J Edwin; Bell, Jason; Badcock, David R",Vision Res,,295

Imaging findings were categorized as ""typical"", ""indeterminate"", ""atypical"", or ""negative"" according to RSNA reporting language and compared to RT-PCR. ""Single, round GGO"" and ""single, peripheral GGO,"" do not fit the reporting language, were also analyzed as ""indeterminate"" patterns. RESULTS: Of the 1186 patients included in the analysis, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed in 388 patients. Of the 388 patients, CT findings were categorized as ""typical"" in 248, ""indeterminate"" in 77, and ""negative"" in 63. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ""typical"" findings were 63.9, 99.0, and 87.5% for COVID-19, respectively. In addition to the ""typical"" findings, the highest diagnostic accuracy of 92.2% was achieved when the ""single, peripheral GGO"" and ""single, round GGO"" were considered to be CT-positive.

502567,[Analysis of medication regularity and pharmacodynamic characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine treatment in 444 severe cases of COVID-19],2020,"The adrenal gland may exhibit a wide variety of pathologic conditions. A number of imaging techniques can be used to characterize these, although it is not always possible to attain a definitive diagnosis radiologically. Incorrect diagnoses may be made if radiologists are not attentive to technical parameters and interpretive factors associated with adrenal gland imaging. Hence, an appreciation of the intricacies of adrenal imaging strategies and characterization is required; this can be aided by understanding the pitfalls of adrenal imaging. Technical pitfalls at CT may relate to the imaging parameters, including region of interest characteristics, tube voltage selection, and the timing of contrast material-enhanced imaging. With MRI, imaging acquisition technique and evaluation of the reference tissues used in chemical shift MRI are important considerations that can directly influence image interpretation. Interpretive errors may occur when evaluating adrenal washout at CT without considering other radiologic features, including the size of adrenal nodules, the presence of fat or calcification, the attenuation of nodules, and atypical imaging features. The characterization of an incidental adrenal lesion as benign or malignant does not end the role of the radiologist; consideration as to whether an adrenal lesion is associated with endocrine dysfunction is required. While imaging may not be optimal for establishing endocrine activity, there are imaging features from which radiologists may infer function. In cases of known endocrine activity, imaging can guide clinical management, including further investigations such as venous sampling. ©RSNA, 2020.","Nandra, Gurinder; Duxbury, Oliver; Patel, Pawan; Patel, Jaymin H; Patel, Nirav; Vlahos, Ioannis",Radiographics,,295

505773,The first consecutive 5000 patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 from Qatar; a nation-wide cohort study,2020,"IntroductionAs of 3rd June 2021, Malaysia is experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. In response, the federal government has implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) under a series of Movement Control Orders and, more recently, a vaccination campaign to regain epidemic control. In this study, we assessed the potential for the vaccination campaign to control the epidemic in Malaysia and four high-burden regions of interest, under various public health response scenarios. MethodsA modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered compartmental model was developed that included two sequential incubation and infectious periods, with stratification by clinical state. The model was further stratified by age and incorporated population mobility to capture NPIs and micro-distancing (behaviour changes not captured through population mobility). Emerging variants of concern (VoC) were included as an additional strain competing with the existing wild-type strain. Several scenarios that included different vaccination strategies (i.e. vaccines that reduce disease severity and/or prevent infection, vaccination coverage) and mobility restrictions were implemented. ResultsThe national model and the regional models all fit well to notification data but underestimated ICU occupancy and deaths in recent weeks, which may be attributable to increased severity of VoC or saturation of case detection. However, the true case detection proportion showed wide credible intervals, highlighting incomplete understanding of the true epidemic size. The scenario projections suggested that under current vaccination rates complete relaxation of all NPIs would trigger a major epidemic. The results emphasise the importance of micro-distancing, maintaining mobility restrictions during vaccination roll-out and accelerating the pace of vaccination for future control. Malaysia is particularly susceptible to a major COVID-19 resurgence resulting from its limited population immunity due to the countrys historical success in maintaining control throughout much of 2020.","Jayasundara, Pavithra; Peariasamy, Kalaiarasu M.; Law, Kian Boon; Rahim, Ku Nurhasni Ku Abd; Lee, Sit Wai; Ghazali, Izzuna Mudla M.; Abayawardana, Milinda; Le, Linh-Vi; Khalaf, Rukun K.S.; Razali, Karina; Le, Xuan; Chong, Zhuo Lin; McBryde, Emma S; Meehan, Michael T; Caldwell, Jamie M.; Ragonnet, Romain; Trauer, James M",,,295

This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of different types of family infections with COVID-19 and to share Taiwan’s experience. Material and methods: We collected cases of family infections of COVID-19 from 21 January 2020 to 16 March 2020. The data were collected from a series of press conference contents by Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC). Results: During this period, there were six family infections in Taiwan, including two couple infections, one imported family cluster infection, and three domestic family cluster infections. Compared to the former two, the starters (cases 19, 24, and 27) of domestic family cluster infections showed longer symptom-onset to diagnosis (p = 0.02); longer symptom-onset to quarantine or isolation (p = 0.01); higher first-generation reproduction number (p = 0.03); and more critical presentation (endotracheal tube insertion and intensive care unit (ICU) care) (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, compared to the former two, the starters of the latter were older, had no history of travel, and had more underlying diseases and more mortality. There are more contacts of domestic family cluster infections, making epidemiological investigations more difficult and expensive. However, the second-generation reproduction number of the above three families was zero. Conclusion: Domestic family cluster infections of COVID-19 have different characteristics and outcomes from couple infection and imported family cluster infections in this study.","Liu, Shih-Feng; Kuo, Nai-Ying; Kuo, Ho-Chang",J.

509393,Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells for COVID-19 Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),2020,"This study introduces an innovative device for the noninvasive sampling and chromatographic analysis of different compounds present in exhaled breath aerosol (EBA). The new sampling device, especially in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic that forced many countries to impose mandatory facemasks, allows an easy monitoring of the subject's exposure to different compounds they may come in contact with, actively or passively. The project combines the advantages of a fabric-phase sorptive membrane (FPSM) as an in vivo sampling device with a validated LC-MS/MS screening procedure able to monitor more than 739 chemicals with an overall analysis time of 18 min. The project involves the noninvasive in vivo sampling of the EBA using an FPSM array inserted inside an FFP2 mask. The study involved 15 healthy volunteers, and no restrictions were imposed during or prior to the sampling process regarding the consumption of drinks, food, or drugs. The FPSM array-LC-MS/MS approach allowed us to effectively exploit the advantages of the two complementary procedures (the convenient sampling by an FPSM array and the rapid analysis by LC-MS/MS), obtaining a powerful and green tool to carry out rapid screening analyses for human exposure to different compounds. The flexible fabric substrate, the sponge-like porous architecture of the high-efficiency sol-gel sorbent coating, the availability of a large cache of sorbent coatings, including polar, nonpolar, mixed mode, and zwitterionic phases, the easy installation into the facemask, and the possibility of sampling without interrupting regular activities provide FPSMs unparalleled advantages over other sampling techniques, and their applications are expected to expand to many other clinical or toxicological studies.","Locatelli, Marcello; Tartaglia, Angela; Ulusoy, Halil I; Ulusoy, Songul; Savini, Fabio; Rossi, Sandra; Santavenere, Francesco; Merone, Giuseppe M; Bassotti, Elisa; D039,; Ovidio, Cristian; Rosato, Enrica; Furton, Kenneth G; Kabir, Abuzar",Anal Chem,,295

510368,Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Cold Agglutinin Syndrome: An Interesting Case,2021,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to further knowledge of older Veterans' experiences with transitioning to the community from Veterans Affairs nursing homes (Community Living Centers or CLCs) with emphasis on social functioning. DESIGN: A qualitative study design was used in addition to administration of standardized depression and mental status screens. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Veterans (n = 18) and caregivers (n = 14) were purposively sampled and recruited from 2 rural CLCs in Upstate New York. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were completed with Veterans in the CLC prior to discharge (to explore experiences during the CLC stay and expectations regarding discharge and returning home) and in the home 2-4 weeks postdischarge (to explore daily routines and perceptions of overall health, mental health, and social functioning). Caregivers participated in 1 interview, completed postdischarge. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the Brief Interview for Mental Status were administered postdischarge. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of verbatim transcriptions revealed 3 inter-related themes: (1) Veterans may experience improved social connectedness in CLCs by nature of the unique care environment (predominantly male, shared military experience); (2) Experiences of social engagement and connectedness varied after discharge and could be discordant with Veterans' expectations for recovery prior to discharge; and (3) Veterans may or may not describe themselves as ""lonely"" after discharge, when physically isolated. Veterans lacked moderate to severe cognitive impairment (Brief Interview for Mental Status: range = 14-15); however, they reported a wide range in depressive symptom severity postdischarge (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire: mean = 4.9, SD = 6.1, median/mode = 3, range = 0-23). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study identified a potential for increased social isolation and disengagement after discharge from Veterans Affairs nursing homes. Nursing homes should integrate social functioning assessment for their residents, while extending care planning and transitional care to address patient-centered social functioning goals.","Simons, Kelsey V; Bower, Emily S; Gillespie, Suzanne M; Mills, Whitney L",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,295

A UK study of 2200 COVID-19 patients found no relationship of ABO blood type to disease severity. A Danish study identified ABO blood group as a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection but not for hospitalization or death from COVID-19. AIM: In the current study, we wished to analyze the relationship of ABO blood group and the ABO genetic locus to COVID-19 test positivity and mortality in subjects from the UK Biobank (UKB). METHODS: ABO blood type is from UKB data field 23165. Blood type was imputed for genotyped UK Biobank participants using three SNPs (rs505922, rs8176719, and rs8176746) in the ABO gene on chromosome 9q34.2. We analyzed the chromosome 9 snp rs657152 to assess the relationship of the ABO locus to COVID-19 test positivity and mortality. RESULTS: COVID-19 test results (negative or positive) were not related to blood group in males (p = 0.977, two tailed Fisher exact test) or females (p = 0.548). COVID-19 outcomes (alive or died) were not related to blood group in males (p = 0.102, two tailed Fisher exact test) or females (p = 0.226). We found no significant relationship of rs657152 to COVID-19 test positivity or mortality.

512029,Adrenal insufficiency in coronavirus disease 2019: a case report,2020,"The fine-tuning of neuroinflammation is crucial for brain homeostasis as well as its immune response. The transcription factor, nuclear factor-&#954;-B (NF&#954;B) is a key inflammatory player that is antagonized via anti-inflammatory actions exerted by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). However, technical limitations have restricted our understanding of how GR is involved in the dynamics of NF&#954;B in vivo. In this study, we used an improved lentiviral-based reporter to elucidate the time course of NF&#954;B and GR activities during behavioral changes from sickness to depression induced by a systemic lipopolysaccharide challenge. The trajectory of NF&#954;B activity established a behavioral basis for the NF&#954;B signal transition involved in three phases, sickness-early-phase, normal-middle-phase, and depressive-like-late-phase. The temporal shift in brain GR activity was differentially involved in the transition of NF&#954;B signals during the normal and depressive-like phases. The middle-phase GR effectively inhibited NF&#954;B in a glucocorticoid-dependent manner, but the late-phase GR had no inhibitory action. Furthermore, we revealed the cryptic role of basal GR activity in the early NF&#954;B signal transition, as evidenced by the fact that blocking GR activity with RU486 led to early depressive-like episodes through the emergence of the brain NF&#954;B activity. These results highlight the inhibitory action of GR on NF&#954;B by the basal and activated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis during body-to-brain inflammatory spread, providing clues about molecular mechanisms underlying systemic inflammation caused by such as COVID-19 infection, leading to depression.","Han, Young-Min; Kim, Min Sun; Jo, Juyeong; Shin, Daiha; Kwon, Seung-Hae; Seo, Jong Bok; Kang, Dongmin; Lee, Byoung Dae; Ryu, Hoon; Hwang, Eun Mi; Kim, Jae-Min; Patel, Paresh D; Lyons, David M; Schatzberg, Alan F; Her, Song",Mol. psychiatry,,295

However, the coronavirus-19 pandemic has drastically impacted the commercial airline industry. To understand potential pandemic-related disruptions in the transportation network of kidneys across the United States, we used national flight data to compare scheduled flights during the pandemic vs 1-year earlier, focusing on Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) pairs between which kidneys historically most likely traveled by direct flight (High Volume by direct Air transport OPO Pairs, HVA-OPs). Across the United States, there were 39% fewer flights in April 2020 vs April 2019. Specific to the kidney transportation network, there were 65.1% fewer flights between HVA-OPs, with considerable OPO-level variation (interquartile range [IQR] 54.7%-75.3%; range 0%-100%). This translated to a drop in median number of flights between HVA-OPs from 112 flights/wk in April 2019 to 34 in April 2020 (P < .001), and a rise in wait time between scheduled flights from 1.5 hours in April 2019 (IQR 0.76-3.3) to 4.9 hours in April 2020 (IQR 2.6-11.2; P < .001). Fewer flights and longer wait times can impact logistics as well as cold ischemia time; our findings motivate an exploration of creative approaches to KT transport as the impact of this pandemic on the airline industry evolves.","Strauss, Alexandra T; Cartier, David; Gunning, Bruce A; Boyarsky, Brian J; Snyder, Jon; Segev, Dorry L; Roush, Michael; Massie, Allan B",Am. j. transplant,,295

Elderly individuals and patients with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension show a higher risk of hospitalization, severe disease, and mortality by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. These patients frequently show exacerbated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines associated with an overreaction of the immune system, the so-called cytokine storm. Host nutritional status plays a pivotal role in the outcome of a variety of different infectious diseases. It is known that the immune system is highly affected by malnutrition, leading to decreased immune responses with consequent augmented risk of infection and disease severity. Body composition, especially low lean mass and high adiposity, has consistently been linked to worsened prognosis in many different diseases.

However, limited information is available on the effect of biological wastewater treatment processes on the formation of CX3R-type DBPs. This study investigated the effect of oxidation ditch (OD) and anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (AAO), two widely used biological wastewater treatment processes, on the formation of five classes of CX3R-type DBPs, including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetaldehydes (HALs), haloacetonitriles (HANs) and halonitromethanes (HNMs), during chlorination. Experimental results showed that biological treatment effectively reduced the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254, while it increased the dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and therefore the ratio of DON/DOC. In addition, increases in the contents of soluble microbial product- and humic acid-like matters, and the transformation of high molecular weight (MW) fractions in the dissolved organic matter into low MW fractions were observed after OD and AAO processes. Although biological treatment effectively decreased the formation of Cl-THMs, Cl-HAAs, Cl-HANs and Cl-HNMs, the formation of DBCM, DBAA, BDCAA, DBCAA, DCAL, TCAL and DBAN (where C = chloro, B = bromo, D = di, T = tri) all increased significantly, due to the increased formation reactivity. Moreover, biological treatment increased the ratio of bromide/DOC and bromine incorporation into THMs, HAAs and DHANs except for HALs and THANs. Different from previous studies, this study revealed that biological treatment increased the formation of some DBPs, especially brominated DBPs, despite the efficient removal of organic matters.

In a multicenter, international study, we investigated if overweight, obesity, and diabetes were independently associated with COVID-19 severity and whether the BMI-associated risk was increased among those with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively extracted data from health care records and regional databases of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 from 18 sites in 11 countries. We used standardized definitions and analyses to generate site-specific estimates, modeling the odds of each outcome (supplemental oxygen/noninvasive ventilatory support, invasive mechanical ventilatory support, and in-hospital mortality) by BMI category (reference, overweight, obese), adjusting for age, sex, and prespecified comorbidities. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients with preexisting diabetes. Site-specific estimates were combined in a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Among 7,244 patients (65.6% overweight/obese), those with overweight were more likely to require oxygen/noninvasive ventilatory support (random effects adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.44; 95% CI 1.15-1.80) and invasive mechanical ventilatory support (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI 1.03-1.46). There was no association between overweight and in-hospital mortality (aOR, 0.88; 95% CI 0.74-1.04). Similar effects were observed in patients with obesity or diabetes. In the subgroup analysis, the aOR for any outcome was not additionally increased in those with diabetes and overweight or obesity. CONCLUSIONS: In adults hospitalized with COVID-19, overweight, obesity, and diabetes were associated with increased odds of requiring respiratory support but were not associated with death. In patients with diabetes, the odds of severe COVID-19 were not increased above the BMI-associated risk.","Longmore, Danielle K; Miller, Jessica E; Bekkering, Siroon; Saner, Christoph; Mifsud, Edin; Zhu, Yanshan; Saffery, Richard; Nichol, Alistair; Colditz, Graham; Short, Kirsty R; Burgner, David P",Diabetes care,,295

Methods: This is a prospective cohort study that included patients hospitalised because of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, three months after their discharge. A clinical evaluation, analytical parameters, chest X-ray, six-minute walk test, spirometry and DLCO–DLNO analysis were performed. Demographic variables, comorbidities, and variables related to the severity of the admission were recorded. Results: Two hundred patients completed the study;59.5% men, age 62 years, 15.5% admitted to the intensive care unit. The most frequent functional alteration, in 27% of patients, was in the DLCO–DLNO combination. This alteration was associated with age, male sex, degree of dyspnoea, poorer perception of health, and limited ability for physical effort. These patients also presented higher levels of D-Dimer and more residual radiological alterations. In 42% of the patients with diffusion alterations, only reduced DLNO was presented, along with lower D-Dimer levels and less capillary volume involvement. The severity of the process was associated with the reduction in DLCO–DLNO. Conclusions: The most sensitive RFT for the detection of the sequelae of COVID-19 pneumonia was the combined measurement of DLCO–DLNO and this factor was related to patient health status and their capacity for physical exertion. In 40% of these cases, there was only a reduction in DLNO, a finding that may indicate less pulmonary vascular involvement.","Núñez-Fernández, Marta Ramos-Hernández Cristina García-Río Francisco Torres-Durán María Nodar-Germiñas Andrés Tilve-Gómez Amara Rodríguez-Fernández Paula Valverde-Pérez Diana Ruano-Raviña Alberto Fernández-Villar Alberto",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,295

590353,Early cidofovir administration might be associated with a lower probability of respiratory failure in treating human adenovirus pneumonia: a retrospective cohort study,2019-10-21,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: This study investigated the impact that supplementing sow’s gestation and lactation feed with oat alone or together with brewer’s yeast has on milk proteins and piglet growth and health. Oat and yeast supplements increased abundance of several milk proteins involved in immune protection. Piglets born from either the oat- or yeast-supplemented sows had decreased incidence of diarrhea after weaning. The average birth weights for piglets born of dams that consumed Oat were significantly greater than those that did not. However, piglets born to sows that consumed yeast in combination with oat weighed less at weaning and gained the least amount of weight post-weaning. These data suggest that oat, and to a lesser extent, yeast, added to maternal diets during gestation and lactation can positively impact milk, growth, and health of offspring but given in combination can potentially negatively affect piglet weight gain. ABSTRACT: Maternal diet supplementation with pro- and prebiotics is associated with decreased incidence of diarrhea and greater piglet performance. This study investigated the impact adding whole ground oat as a prebiotic, alone or in combination with a probiotic, yeast culture (YC) (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), to sow gestation and lactation rations had on milk protein composition, piglet growth, and incidence of post-weaning diarrhea (PWD). Diets: control (CON), CON + yeast culture (YC) [5 g/kg], CON + oat (15% inclusion rate) (Oat) or CON+ YC [5 g/kg] + Oat (15%) were fed the last 30 days of gestation and throughout lactation (18–21 days). Shotgun proteome analysis of day 4 and 7 postpartum milk found 36 differentially abundant proteins (P-adj < 0.1) in both Oat and YC supplemented sows relative to CON. Notable was the increased expression of antimicrobial proteins, lactoferrin and chitinase in milk of Oat and YC sows compared to CON. The levels of IgA, IgM (within colostrum and milk) and IgG (within milk) were similar across treatments. However, colostral IgG levels in Oat-supplemented sows were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that of the control sows, IgG from Oat-supplemented sows displayed greater reactivity to E. coli-antigens compared with CON and YC. Piglets from sows that consumed Oat alone or in combination weighed significantly more (p < 0.05) at birth compared to CON and YC. However, piglets in the Oat + YC group weighed less at weaning and had the lowest weight gain (p < 0.05) postweaning, compared with CON. Taken together with the observation that piglets of either YC- or Oat-fed sows had less PWD compared to CON and YC+ Oat suggests that Oat or YC supplementation positively impacts piglets through expression of certain milk-associated immune and antimicrobial proteins.","Donovan, Barry; Suarez-Trujillo, Aridany; Casey, Theresa; Aryal, Uma K.; Conklin, Dawn; Williams, Leonard L.; Minor, Radiah C.",Animals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11020497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33672799/,295

We aimed to understand barriers to implementing a telerehabilitation clinical service and design a behavior support strategy for clinicians to implement telerehabilitation. A hybrid implementation study design included pre- and post-intervention questionnaires, identification of key barriers to implementation using the theoretical domains framework, and development of a targeted intervention. Thirty-one clinicians completed baseline questionnaires identifying key barriers to the implementation of telerehabilitation. Barriers were associated with behavior domains of knowledge, environment, social influences, and beliefs. A 6-week brief intervention focused on remote clinician support, and education was well received but achieved little change in perceived barriers to implementation. The brief intervention to support implementation of telerehabilitation during COVID-19 achieved clinical practice change, but barriers remain. Longer follow-up may determine the sustainability of a brief implementation strategy, but needs to consider pandemic-related stressors.","Cox, Narelle S.; Scrivener, Katharine; Holland, Anne E.; Jolliffe, Laura; Wighton, Alison; Nelson, Sean; McCredie, Laura; Lannin, Natasha A.",Arch Phys Med Rehabil,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2020.12.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33417964/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003999320313800; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003999320313800,295

Fear-related disorders are characterized by dysregulations in fear and the associated neural pathways. In the present study, we examined whether individual variations in the fear neural connectome can predict fear-related symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using machine learning algorithms and back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) deep learning algorithms, we demonstrated that the intrinsic neural connectome before the COVID-19 pandemic could predict who would develop high fear-related symptoms at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in China (Accuracy rate = 75.00%, Sensitivity rate = 65.83%, Specificity rate = 84.17%). More importantly, prediction models could accurately predict the level of fear-related symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic by using the prepandemic connectome state, in which the functional connectivity of lvmPFC (left ventromedial prefrontal cortex)-rdlPFC (right dorsolateral), rdACC (right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex)-left insula, lAMY (left amygdala)-lHip (left hippocampus) and lAMY-lsgACC (left subgenual cingulate cortex) was contributed to the robust prediction. The current study capitalized on prepandemic data of the neural connectome of fear to predict participants who would develop high fear-related symptoms in COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that individual variations in the intrinsic organization of the fear circuits represent a neurofunctional marker that renders subjects vulnerable to experience high levels of fear during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Feng, Pan; Chen, Zhiyi; Becker, Benjamin; Liu, Xiqin; Zhou, Feng; He, Qinghua; Qiu, Jiang; Lei, Xu; Chen, Hong; Feng, Tingyong",Cerebral cortex,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34297795/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhab232,295

Even as the face-to-face survey data collection efforts are resuming in different parts of the world with COVID-19 safety protocols, the rapidly-acquired experience with phone surveys on the part of national statistical offices and survey practitioners in low- and middle-income countries appears to have formed the foundation for phone surveys to be more commonly implemented in the post-pandemic era, in response to other shocks and as complementary efforts to face-to-face surveys. Informed by the practical experience with the high-frequency phone surveys that have been implemented with support from the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) to monitor the socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper provides an overview of options for the design and implementation of phone surveys to collect representative data from households and individuals.

Critical patients with COVID-19 require basic and advanced respiratory support. Therefore, the objective was to describe the ventilatory support strategies in SARS-CoV-2 during intensive therapy. Materials and methods: A systematic review of observational studies of the available scientific literature was performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane collaboration and the criteria of the PRISMA Declaration. Results: Fifteen observational studies were included that gave a study population of 4,081 patients. Mechanical ventilation is the main respiratory support treatment for critically ill patients, which should be administered as soon as normal oxygenation cannot be maintained, and despite the fact that there is no current consensus on the parameters of mechanical ventilation, the evidence collected suggests the use of Fio2 on average 50%, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, lung compliance of 29-37 ml per cm of water, driving pressure between 12-14 cm of water and a plateau pressure of 22-25 cm of water. Conclusions: IL-6 is shown as a possible marker of respiratory failure and a worse prognosis as well as obesity. In addition, the use of prone position, neuromuscular blockade, pulmonary vasodilators, ECMO, and mechanical ventilation based on the clinical conditions and needs of the patient with COVID-19 are strategies that could benefit patients entering intensive therapy for SARS-CoV- 2.","Pereira Rodriguez, J.

Advisories across the world have appealed to people to stay at home and observe social distancing to slow down the pandemic. However it is important to realize as to how this is affecting acute cardiovascular care. Recent studies from Europe and USA have reported > 50% reduction in hospital admissions for ACS and declining rates of coronary interventions. The possible reasons for this noticeable reduction in patients with ACS/STEMI during the COVID-19 pandemic are multi-factorial. On one hand, it is due to change in thresholds for referring patients of ACS/STEMI for cardiac catheterization, with fibrinolysis being acceptable for many stable STEMI patients and conservative management being preferred for NSTEMI patients. Theories abound on how ""staying at home"" strategy may have led to an reduction in acute coronary events due to healthier lifestyle, better compliance and reduced stress. Realistically however, a more disquieting reason would be a ""pseudo-reduction"" ie. the incidence of ACS/STEMI is actually the same, but these patients are staying away from hospitals due to fear of contracting the infection. Lockdown restrictions have also limited transport options for patients seeking to reach hospitals in time. Healthcare systems need to be prepared for an anticipated downstream deluge of such untreated patients who may present with sequelae like heart failure, reinfarction, arrhythmias, mechanical complications etc. Scientific societies should have proactive campaigns to alleviate patient concerns, and encourage them to seek timely medical attention despite the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kapoor, Aditya; Yadav, Rakesh",Indian Heart J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ihj.2020.05.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32768020/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019483220301231; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019483220301231?v=s5,295

ONBEHALF: the GeroCovid Investigators Introduction. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia diagnosed in elderly patients. It often associates with disabling complications, such as stroke and systemic embolism. COVID-19 severely affects older subjects, who show a particularly high mortality, often related to relevant alterations in coagulation and inflammation cascade. Purpose. Aim of this study was to evaluate how the presence of a prevalent form of AF (at admission or in clinical history) influenced the clinical course of COVID-19 in an aged in-hospital population. Methods. We studied the acute patients included in GeroCovid, a multicenter retrospective-prospective registry designed by the Italian Society of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine and the Norwegian Geriatrics Society. GeroCovid, independently of the healthcare setting and without exclusion criteria, enrolled subjects aged >60 years to analyze risk factors, signs, symptoms and outcomes of COVID-19 in older people. For the purpose of this study, only the acute, in-hospital, cohort was evaluated. Results. Between March 1st and June 6th 2020, 2474 patients were enrolled in GeroCovid. Of these, 806 (32.6%) were assisted in hospital, for an acute condition (age: 79 ± 9 years; men: 51.7%). The prevalence of AF was 21.8%. Patients with the arrhythmia were older (82 ± 8 vs. 77 ± 9 years; p < 0.001) and with a higher CHA2DS2-VASc score (4.1 ± 1.5 vs. 3.2 ± 1.5; p < 0.001). The prevalence of almost all comorbidities was higher in AF patients (in particular, hypertension, cardiac diseases, diabetes, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, chronic renal failure, COPD, stroke, obesity). At multivariable analysis, advanced age (p = 0.010), an increased number of white blood cells (p = 0.031), the presence of cardiac diseases (p < 0.001), peripheral artery disease (p = 0.030) and of signs or symptoms of heart failure (p = 0.003) characterized older patients with AF. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with the arrhythmia (36.9 vs. 27.5%; OR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.09-2.20; p = 0.015). A multivariable logistic regression model showed that AF was an independent predictor of mortality (p = 0.021), such as male gender (p = 0.014) and the presence of peripheral artery disease (p = 0.003). COPD, stroke, chronic renal failure, diabetes and obesity were deleted from the final model. Conclusions. AF is frequently observed in older patients with COVID-19. Subjects with both conditions have a more complex clinical status and show a higher in-hospital mortality, thus requesting a particularly careful and intensive management.","Fumagalli, S; Pelagalli, G; Trevisan, C; Del Signore, S; Volpato, S; Gareri, P; Mossello, E; Malara, A; Monzani, F; Coin, A; Bellelli, G; Zia, G; Antonelli Incalzi, R",Europace,https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euab116.154,295

At Houston Methodist Hospital (HMH), a virtual intensive care unit (vICU) was used amid the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to detail the novel adaptations and rapid expansion of the vICU that were applied to achieve patient-centric solutions while protecting staff and patients’ families during the pandemic. METHODS: The planned vICU implementation was redirected to meet the emerging needs of conversion of COVID-19 ICUs, including alterations to staged rollout timing, virtual and in-person staffing, and scope of application. With the majority of the hospital critical care physician workforce redirected to rapidly expanded COVID-19 ICUs, the non–COVID-19 ICUs were managed by cardiovascular surgeons, cardiologists, neurosurgeons, and acute care surgeons. HMH expanded the vICU program to fill the newly depleted critical care expertise in the non–COVID-19 units to provide urgent, emergent, and code blue support to all ICUs. RESULTS: Virtual family visitation via the Consultant Bridge application, palliative care delivery, and specialist consultation for patients with COVID-19 exemplify the successful adaptation of the vICU implementation. Patients with COVID-19, who were isolated and separated from their families to prevent the spread of infection, were able to virtually see and hear their loved ones, which bolstered the mental and emotional status of those patients. Many families expressed gratitude for the ability to see and speak with their loved ones. The vICU also protected medical staff and specialists assigned to COVID-19 units, reducing exposure and conserving personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Telecritical care has been established as an advantageous mechanism for the delivery of critical care expertise during the expedited rollout of the vICU at Houston Methodist Hospital. Overall responses from patients, families, and physicians are in favor of continued vICU care; however, further research is required to examine the impact of innovative applications of telecritical care in the treatment of critically ill patients.","Dhala, Atiya; Sasangohar, Farzan; Kash, Bita; Ahmadi, Nima; Masud, Faisal",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/20143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32795997/,295

Our research examines the crucial role of community volunteers and their effective deployment during a crisis. We analyze individual and collaborative service activities based on usage data from 85,699 COVID-19 volunteers gathered through China’s leading digital volunteering platform, as well as a survey conducted among a sample of 2,270 of these COVID-19 volunteers using the platform and interviews with 14 civil society leaders in charge of coordinating service activities. Several results emerge: the value of collaboration among local citizens, civil society including community-based groups, and regional government to fill gaps in public services; the key role of experienced local volunteers, who rapidly shifted to COVID-19 from other causes as the pandemic peaked; and an example of state-led coproduction based on long-term relationships.

As a result, they may not be completely aware of the danger/risk involved, which could impact their ability to control the spread of the virus. This systematic review aims to enhance HWs' knowledge and their perception of the spread risk of COVID‐19 during the pandemic. A search was conducted in four databases (Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and ScienceDirect) to locate peer‐reviewed studies published in English between January 2020 and April 2020. Eventually, nine articles satisfied the inclusion criteria and were, therefore, included in the present study. Six of the aforementioned studies specifically investigated HWs' perception of risk. Apart from a study that indicated medium perception (min = 56.5%), all other studies found high levels of risk perception (n = 5, max 92.1%). As for HWs' knowledge, apart from two studies that indicated medium percentage levels (min = 56.5%), the rest of the studies report high percentages (n = 7, max = 93.2%). Two of the studies, which assessed the sources of information that HWs use, agree that social media is the most widely used source of information. The findings of this study suggest that HWs had a satisfactory perception of risk during the spread of COVID‐19. Although fields with medium knowledge levels were identified, HWs' overall knowledge may also be described as satisfactory. It is also noted that certain demographic characteristics (occupation, age, and years of experience) appear to affect HWs' knowledge and perceptions. The application of educational strategies aiming to provide continuous support to HWs is unanimously recommended by all studies.","Polychronis, Giannis; Roupa, Zoe",J Public Aff,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349744/; https://doi.org/10.1002/pa.2558,295

We evaluated the immune and metabolic profiles of 205 elderly Singaporeans administered with Vaxigrip. Despite high seroprotection rates, we observed heterogeneity in the response. We stratified the cohort into complete (CR) or incomplete responders (IR), where IR exhibited signs of accelerated T cell aging. We found a higher upregulation of genes associated with the B-cell endoplasmic-reticulum stress response in CR, where XBP-1 acts as a key upstream regulator. B-cells from IR were incapable of matching the level of XBP-1 upregulation observed in CR after inducing ER stress with tunicamycin in vitro. Metabolic signatures also distinguished CR and IR – as CR presented with a greater diversity of bile acids.

While cardiac injury has been demonstrated in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the mechanism of injury remains unclear. Here, we review our current knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential mechanisms of myocardial injury due to viral toxicities and host immune responses. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of studies have reported an epidemiological association between history of cardiac disease and worsened outcome during COVID infection. Development of new onset myocardial injury during COVID-19 also increases mortality. While limited data exist, potential mechanisms of cardiac injury include direct viral entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and toxicity in host cells, hypoxia-related myocyte injury, and immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome. Potential treatments for reducing viral infection and excessive immune responses are also discussed. SUMMARY: COVID patients with cardiac disease history or acquire new cardiac injury are at an increased risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality. More studies are needed to address the mechanism of cardiotoxicity and the treatments that can minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system.","Zhu, Han; Rhee, June-Wha; Cheng, Paul; Waliany, Sarah; Chang, Amy; Witteles, Ronald M.; Maecker, Holden; Davis, Mark M.; Nguyen, Patricia K.; Wu, Sean M.",Curr Cardiol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32318865/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-020-01292-3,295

There is considerable discussion amongst clinicians as well as lay people about anosmia and ageusia in COVID-19 sufferers. We aimed to report the results from comprehensive olfactory and gustatory testing in a series of hospital in-patients. METHODS: The prospective study evaluated 81 individuals with a COVID-19 infection, as confirmed by 2019 n-cov Real-Time PCR laboratory testing. The control group consisted of forty individuals with COVID-19 negative. Olfactory and gustatory testings were carried out by an examiner utilizing stringent safety standards and wearing full personal protective equipment. The results obtained in the case group were then compared with those obtained for the controls. RESULTS: In the case group, 41(50.6%) of patients were male and 40 (49.4%) were female, mean age of 54.16 ± 16.98 years (18–95). In the control group, 21 (52.5%) of subjects were male and 19 (47.5%) were female, and mean age was 55 ± 15.39 years (18–90). Fifty (61.7%) COVID-19-positive patients had complaints related to olfaction. The distribution of olfactory symptoms in the case group differed at the level of statistical significance from the control group (p < 0.001). Turning to gustatory abnormalities, within the case group, 22 individuals (27.2%) had taste malfunction. A statistically significant difference was found in the distribution of gustatory abnormalities between cases and controls (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hyposmia with or without hypogeusia is potentially a reliable indicator of latent COVID-19.","Altin, Fazilet; Cingi, Cemal; Uzun, Tankut; Bal, Cengiz",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-06155-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32577902/,295
610386,Pulmonary Embolism in a COVID-19-Positive Primigravida After Caesarean Section Despite Prophylaxis,2021,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Virus-like particles (VLPs) have attracted significant interest as immunotherapy platforms and cancer vaccines for inducing antigen-specific immune responses against tumors. We prepared a human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) cancer vaccine, by conjugating the HER2-derived CH401 epitope to the external surface of Physalis mottle virus (PhMV)-like particles via copper-free click chemistry. Another candidate was prepared by loading Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists as adjuvant into the interior cavity of PhMV-CH401—although the addition of the adjuvant conferred no additional immune priming. The VLP-based anti-HER2 vaccine candidate was administered subcutaneously, using a prime-boost immunization schedule and BALB/c mice. The vaccine candidate elicited a strong immune response, including high titers of HER2-specific immunoglobulins and increased the toxicity of antisera to DDHER2 tumor cells. DDHER2 tumor challenge studies demonstrated efficacy, as evident from the delayed onset of tumor growth and the prolonged survival of the vaccinated vs. naïve BALB/C mice. ABSTRACT: To develop a human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-specific cancer vaccine, using a plant virus-like particle (VLP) platform. Copper-free click chemistry and infusion encapsulation protocols were developed to prepare VLPs displaying the HER2-derived CH401 peptide epitope, with and without Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists loaded into the interior cavity of the VLPs; Physalis mottle virus (PhMV)-based VLPs were used. After prime-boost immunization of BALB/c mice through subcutaneous administration of the vaccine candidates, sera were collected and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the CH401-specific antibodies; Th1 vs. Th2 bias was determined by antibody subtyping and splenocyte assay. Efficacy was assessed by tumor challenge using DDHER2 tumor cells. We successful developed two VLP-based anti-HER2 vaccine candidates—PhMV-CH401 vs. CpG-PhMV-CH401; however, the addition of the CpG adjuvant did not confer additional immune priming. Both VLP-based vaccine candidates elicited a strong immune response, including high titers of HER2-specific immunoglobulins and increased toxicity of antisera to DDHER2 tumor cells. DDHER2 tumor growth was delayed, leading to prolonged survival of the vaccinated vs. naïve BALB/C mice. The PhMV-based anti-HER2 vaccine PhMV-CH401, demonstrated efficacy as an anti-HER2 cancer vaccine. Our studies highlight that VLPs derived from PhMV are a promising platform to develop cancer vaccines.","Hu, He; Steinmetz, Nicole F.",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13122909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34200802/,295

612042,Coronavirus disease 2019 and dengue: two case reports,2021-03-26,"BACKGROUND: The baculovirus (BV) Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used in numerous protein expression systems because of its ability to infect insect cells and serves as a useful vaccination vector with several benefits, such as its low clinical risks and posttranslational modification ability. We recently reported that dendritic cells (DCs) infected with BV stimulated antitumor immunity. The recombinant BV (rBV) also strongly stimulated peptide-specific T-cells and antitumor immunity. In this study, the stimulation of an immune response against EG7-OVA tumors in mice by a recombinant baculovirus-based combination vaccine expressing fragment C-ovalbumin (FrC-OVA-BV; rBV) was evaluated. RESULTS: We constructed an rBV expressing fragment C (FrC) of tetanus toxin containing a promiscuous MHC II-binding sequence and a p30-ovalbumin (OVA) peptide that functions in the MHC I pathway. The results showed that rBV activated the CD8(+) T-cell-mediated response much more efficiently than the wild-type BV (wtBV). Experiments with EG7-OVA tumor mouse models showed that rBV significantly decreased tumor volume and increased survival compared with those in the wild-type BV or FrC-OVA DNA vaccine groups. In addition, a significant antitumor effect of classic prophylactic or therapeutic vaccinations was observed for rBV against EG7-OVA-induced tumors compared with that in the controls. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that FrC-OVA-BV (rBV) induced antitumor immunity, paving the way for its use in BV immunotherapy against malignancies.","Kondou, Keigo; Suzuki, Tomoyuki; Chang, Myint Oo; Takaku, Hiroshi",J Biol Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649751/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13036-019-0207-y,295
612052,Coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy - letter to the editor,2021-03-15,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a virus known as SARS-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). Without a targeted-medicine, this disease has been causing a massive humanitarian crisis not only in terms of mortality, but also imposing a lasting damage to social life and economic progress of humankind. Therefore, an immediate therapeutic strategy needs to be intervened to mitigate this global crisis. Here, we report a novel KepTide™ (Knock-End Peptide) therapy that nullifies SARS-CoV2 infection. SARS-CoV2 employs its surface glycoprotein “spike” (S-glycoprotein) to interact with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for its infection in host cells. Based on our in-silico-based homology modeling study validated with a recent X-ray crystallographic structure (PDB ID:6M0J), we have identified that a conserved motif of S-glycoprotein that intimately engages multiple hydrogen-bond (H-bond) interactions with ACE-2 enzyme. Accordingly, we designed a peptide, termed as ACIS (ACE-2 Inhibitory motif of Spike), that displayed significant affinity towards ACE-2 enzyme as confirmed by biochemical assays such as BLItz and fluorescence polarization assays. Interestingly, more than one biochemical modifications were adopted in ACIS in order to enhance the inhibitory action of ACIS and hence called as KEpTide™. Consequently, a monolayer invasion assay, plaque assay and dual immunofluorescence analysis further revealed that KEpTide™ efficiently mitigated the infection of SARS-CoV2 in vitro in VERO E6 cells. Finally, evaluating the relative abundance of ACIS in lungs and the potential side-effects in vivo in mice, our current study discovers a novel KepTide™ therapy that is safe, stable, and robust to attenuate the infection of SARS-CoV2 virus if administered intranasally.","Gottschalk, Gunnar; Keating, James; Kessler, Kris; Luan, Chi-Hao; Knox, Konstance; Roy, Avik",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.13.337584,295

However, there is no evidence of its impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult patients who presented up to 3 days after onset of Covid-19 symptoms (dry cough, fever, and/or fatigue) were enrolled. After confirmation of SARS-CoV2 infection by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either nitazoxanide (500 mg) or placebo, TID, for 5 days. The primary outcome was complete resolution of symptoms. Secondary outcomes were viral load, general laboratory tests, serum biomarkers of inflammation, and hospitalization rate. Adverse events were also assessed. From June 8 to August 20, 2020, 1,575 patients were screened. Of these, 392 (198 placebo, 194 nitazoxanide) were analyzed. Median time from symptom onset to first dose of study drug was 5 (4-5) days. At the 5-day study visit, symptom resolution did not differ between the nitazoxanide and placebo arms. However, at the 1-week follow-up, 78% in the nitazoxanide arm and 57% in the placebo arm reported complete resolution of symptoms (p=0.048). Swabs collected were negative for SARS-CoV-2 in 29.9% of patients in the nitazoxanide arm versus 18.2% in the placebo arm (p=0.009). Viral load was also reduced after nitazoxanide compared to placebo (p=0.006). No serious adverse events were observed. In patients with mild Covid-19, symptom resolution did not differ between the nitazoxanide and placebo groups after 5 days of therapy. However, early nitazoxanide therapy was safe and reduced viral load significantly.","Rocco, P. R. M.; Silva, P. L.; Cruz, F. F.; Junior, M. A. C. M.; Tierno, P. F. G. M. M.; Moura, M. d.

Understanding the equilibrium between innate and adaptive protective responses and immune pathology might contribute to the development of strategies against ASFV. Here we compare, using a proteomic approach, the course of the in vivo infection caused by two homologous strains: the virulent E75 and the attenuated E75CV1. Our results show a progressive loss of proteins by day 7 post-infection (pi) with E75, reflecting tissue destruction. Many signal pathways were affected by both infections but in different ways and extensions. Cytoskeletal remodelling and clathrin-endocytosis were affected by both isolates, while a greater number of proteins involved on inflammatory and immunological pathways were altered by E75CV1. 14-3-3 mediated signalling, related to immunity and apoptosis, was inhibited by both isolates. The implication of the Rho GTPases by E75CV1 throughout infection is also evident. Early events reflected the lack of E75 recognition by the immune system, an evasion strategy acquired by the virulent strains, and significant changes at 7 days post-infection (dpi), coinciding with the peak of infection and the time of death. The protein signature at day 31 pi with E75CV1 seems to reflect events observed at 1 dpi, including the upregulation of proteosomal subunits and molecules described as autoantigens (vimentin, HSPB1, enolase and lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1), which allow the speculation that auto-antibodies could contribute to chronic ASFV infections. Therefore, the use of proteomics could help understand ASFV pathogenesis and immune protection, opening new avenues for future research.

Traditionally, MS has been considered a chronic, inflammatory disorder of the central white matter in which ensuing demyelination results in physical disability. Recently, MS has become increasingly viewed as a neurodegenerative disorder in which axonal injury, neuronal loss, and atrophy of the central nervous system leads to permanent neurological and clinical disability. In this article, we discuss the latest developments on MS research, including etiology, pathology, genetic association, EAE animal models, mechanisms of neuronal injury and axonal transport, and therapeutics. In this article, we also focus on the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction that are involved in MS, including mitochondrial DNA defects, and mitochondrial structural/functional changes.","Mao, Peizhong; Reddy, P.

The aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and dreaming in adolescents. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Italy, Romania and Croatia involving 2,105 secondary school students (69% girls, mean age 15.6 ± 2.1 years; 31% boys, mean age 15.1 ± 2.2 years; mean age of whole sample 15.4 ± 2.1 years). No substantial differences between countries were found. Thirty-one percent of the participants reported heightened dream recall, 18% noticed an increase in nightmares during the lockdown, and 15% of the provided dreams (n = 498) included pandemic-related content. The results indicate that subjective emotional reactions to lockdown had a significantly higher correlation to dreaming than objective distress (i.e., illness or death of a close one because of COVID-19). These findings suggest that attention to dreams should be included in preventive programs for adolescents with pandemic-related stress.","Guerrero-Gomez, Ana; Nöthen-Garunja, Isabel; Schredl, Michael; Homberg, Annelore; Vulcan, Maria; Brusić, Asja; Bonizzi, Caterina; Iannaco, Cecilia",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.652627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33959080/,295

In this paper, we present a deterministic model to model the impact of social distancing on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in South Africa. The model is fitted to the currently available data on the cumulative number of infected cases and a scenario analysis on different levels of social distancing are presented. The results show a continued rise in the number of cases in the lock down period with the current levels of social distancing albeit at a lower rate. The model shows that the number of cases will rise to above 4000 cases by the end of the lockdown. The model also looks at the impact of relaxing the social distancing measures after the initial announcement of the lock down measures. A relaxation of the social distancing by 2% can result in a 23% rise in the number of cumulative cases while on the other hand increasing the levels of social distancing by 2% would reduce the number of cumulative cases by about 18%. These results have implications on the management and policy direction in the early phases of the epidemic.","Nyabadza, F.; Chirove, F.; Chukwu, W. C.; Visaya, M.

623386,QTc interval prolongation and life-threatening arrhythmias during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. Results from a multi-center prospective registry,2020-10-24,"Introduction: Recurrent cystitis, defined as at least two episodes within six months or three episodes within one year, presented among about one fifth to one-third of women with history of cystitis or urinary tract infection (UTI) according to previous studies. However, the use of antibiotics can only resolve the urinary symptoms but not reduce the frequency of urinary symptoms recurrence, and meanwhile increasing rates of adverse effect of repetitive antimicrobial therapy and bacterial antimicrobial resistance became clinical concerns. This case report aims to present a case of recurrent cystitis treated by electroacupuncture (EA) in reducing recurrent frequency, amount of antibiotics used and urinary symptoms. Case presentation: A 42-year-old woman diagnosed with recurrent cystitis for five years presented mainly with recurrent dysuria, urine frequency and urgency. She received EA treatment 3 to 5 sessions a week and 30 min per session from August 2019 to August 2020 with 3-month suspension due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). During the treatment, both the frequency of recurrent urinary episode and symptoms were reduced. Although there was some fluctuation, the mean frequencies of daytime voiding reduced dramatically from 17.7 to 8.3, and night-time voiding from 4 to 1, and the number of voiding with moderate urgency was reduced from 17.7 to 2.3, and severe urgency dropped from 2.7 to 0. The patient's scores of overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) and overactive bladder questionnaire short form (OAB-q SF) were also improved. The postvoid residual urine volume (PVR) reduced from 42 mL to less than 10 mL. Conclusion: This case of individual effect of EA for a woman with frequent recurrent cystitis suggested a plausible benefit of EA on reducing frequency, amount of antibiotics used and symptoms of recurrent cystitis, but further research is necessary to proof the efficacy and effectiveness among a wider population.

The present study aimed to investigate the impact of lockdown on the psychology, training, and sleep habits of a cohort of basketball players. An online survey involving 169 professional and amateur athletes was conducted using four validated psychological questionnaires (WLEIS-S, POMS, BRS, SMS-II) and a Likert scale to measure the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and training variables. Gender differences in fatigue (p = 0.022); friendships (p = 0.017); others’ emotional appraisal (p < 0.001); and resilience (p = 0.031) were apparent, with higher values for women in all categories bar resilience. Comparisons before and during the lockdown revealed that all participants reduced their RPE (p < 0.001); training days (p = 0.004); and training hours (p < 0.001), and experienced a decline in the quality of sleep (p < 0.001). Sleep hours (p < 0.001) increased during lockdown. The professionals and females maintained their training days (p > 0.05), while the non-professionals and males did not. Psychological states during lockdown were a predictor of the differences in training and recovery variables. In situations where training and competition are limited, it is important to develop plans to maintain physical activity, good quality sleep, and promote greater emotional management and understanding to control negative moods.","Lorenzo Calvo, Jorge; Granado-Peinado, Miriam; de la Rubia, Alfonso; Muriarte, Diego; Lorenzo, Alberto; Mon-López, Daniel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501619/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179025,295

627953,"Adverse pregnancy outcomes, maternal complications, and severe illness among U.S. delivery hospitalizations with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis",2021-05-12,"Drug repurposing is also termed as drug repositioning or therapeutic switching. This method is applied to identify the novel therapeutic agents from the existing FDA approved clinically used drug molecules. It is considered as an efficient approach to develop drug candidates with new pharmacological activities or therapeutic properties. As the drug discovery is a costly, time-consuming, laborious, and highly risk process, the novel approach of drug repositioning is employed to increases the success rate of drug development. This strategy is more advantageous over traditional drug discovery process in terms of reducing duration of drug development, low-cost, highly efficient and minimum risk of failure. In addition to this, World health organization declared Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as pandemic globally on February 11, 2020. Currently, there is an urgent need to develop suitable therapeutic agents for the prevention of the outbreak of COVID-19. So, various investigations were carried out to design novel drug molecules by utilizing different approaches of drug repurposing to identify drug substances for treatment of COVID-19, which can act as significant inhibitors against viral proteins. It has been reported that COVID-19 can infect human respiratory system by entering into the alveoli of lung via respiratory tract. So, the infection occurs due to specific interaction or binding of spike protein with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. Hence, drug repurposing strategy is utilized to identify suitable drugs by virtual screening of drug libraries. This approach helps to determine the binding interaction of drug candidates with target protein of coronavirus by using computational tools such as molecular similarity and homology modeling etc. For predicting the drug-receptor interactions and binding affinity, molecular docking study and binding free energy calculations are also performed. The methodologies involved in drug repurposing can be categorized into three groups such as drug-oriented, target-oriented and disease or therapy-oriented depending on the information available related to quality and quantity of the physico-chemical, biological, pharmacological, toxicological and pharmacokinetic property of drug molecules. This review focuses on drug repurposing strategy applied for existing drugs including Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Ribavirin, Baraticinib, Tocilizumab, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Prulifloxacin, Carfilzomib, Bictegravir, Nelfinavir, Tegobuvir and Glucocorticoids etc to determine their effectiveness toward the treatment of COVID-19.","Sahoo, Biswa Mohan; Ravi Kumar, B.

First, it is suggested that anti‐vector immunity takes place as homologous vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV‐19 vaccine is applied and interferes with vaccine efficacy when the interval between prime and booster doses is less than 3 months. Second, longitudinal studies suggest that ChAdOx1 nCoV‐19 vaccine provides suboptimal efficacy against SARS‐CoV‐2 Alpha variant, which appears to have an increased transmissibility among vaccinated people. At the moment, ChAdOx1 nCoV‐19 vaccine is able to reduce the severity of symptoms and transmissibility. However, if the vaccinated individuals do not maintain physical preventive measures, they could turn into potential spreaders, thus suggesting that mass vaccination will not quickly solve the pandemic. Possible consequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 evolution and of repeated anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccinations are discussed and adoption of an influenza‐like vaccination strategy is suggested.","Zamai, Loris; Rocchi, Marco B.

Consecutive patients with RA consulting their rheumatologist in six Middle Eastern Countries were invited to watch an educational video developed to teach self-assessment using Disease Activity Score (DAS-28). Then, a rheumatology nurse conducted a semi-structured interview and collected the patients’ perception about the understanding of the video, feasibility, capability and confidence in performing self-assessment using Likert-type items. The degree of confidence with self-assessment was correlated to the patients’ socio-demographic characteristics. Sixty-two patients were included and had an overall positive reaction to the video. It was easy to understand in 96% and helped facilitate self-assessment in 92% of cases. Self-assessment was considered totally feasible in 74%, and 66% of patients were capable of always doing it, with a confidence of 60% (always) to 34% (sometimes). Confidence was associated with a higher educational level. Nevertheless, 77% of patients felt that the self-assessment would not fully replace the physician’s visit. Open-ended questions identified five themes: better understanding of the disease, easier communication with the rheumatologist, less consultation time, difficulty with the scoring part and importance of practice. Patients with RA felt that self-assessment was feasible and helpful in understanding RA, improving communication with the rheumatologist and shortening the visit time.

639983,Morbidity and Mortality among Adults Experiencing Homelessness Hospitalized with COVID-19,2021-05-16,"BACKGROUND: Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that infects the intestinal tract and causes diarrhea and vomiting in older pigs or extreme dehydration and death that could reach 100% mortality in neonatal piglets. In the US, the first PEDV outbreaks occurred in 2013 and since then US PEDV strains have quickly spread throughout the US and worldwide, causing significant economic and public health concerns. Currently two conditionally approved vaccines exist in the US, but there is no live attenuated vaccine, which is considered the best option in controlling PEDV by inducing transferrable mucosal immunity to susceptible neonatal piglets. In this study, we passaged an US PEDV isolate under various conditions to generate three strains and characterized their growth and antigenicity in cell culture using various assays including Western blot analysis, serum neutralization assay, sequencing analysis and confocal microscopy. Finally, these strains were evaluated for pathogenicity in nursing piglets (1–4 days old). RESULTS: One of the PEDV strains generated in this study (designated as PEDV 8aa) is able to replicate in cells without any protease and grows to a high titer of >8 log(10) TCID(50)/ml in cell culture. Interestingly, replication of PEDV 8aa was severely reduced by trypsin and this correlated with the inhibition of virus attachment and entry into the cells. In neonatal nursing piglets, PEDV 8aa (passage number 70 or 105) was found to be fully attenuated with limited virus shedding. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that applying selective pressure during viral passages can facilitate attainment of viral attenuation and that PEDV 8aa warrants further investigation as an attenuated vaccine.","Kim, Yunjeong; Oh, Changin; Shivanna, Vinay; Hesse, Richard A.; Chang, Kyeong-Ok",BMC Vet Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1283-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29178878/,295

Biochemical markers may help with management and prognostication of COVID-19 patients; however, their utility is still under investigation. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate, and high sensitivity troponin T (TnT) levels in 67 patients who were admitted to a Canadian tertiary care centre for management of COVID-19. Logistic, cause-specific Cox proportional-hazards, and accelerated failure-time regression modelling were performed to assess the associations of initial analyte concentrations with in-hospital death and length of stay in hospital; joint modelling was performed to assess the associations of the concentrations over the course of the hospital stay with in-hospital death. RESULTS: Initial TnT and CRP concentrations were associated with length of stay in hospital. Eighteen patients died (27%), and the median initial TnT concentration was higher in patients who died (55 ng/L) than those who lived (16 ng/L; P<0.0001). There were no survivors with an initial TnT concentration >64 ng/L. While the initial TnT concentration was predictive of death, later measurements were not. Only CRP had prognostic value with both the initial and subsequent measurements: a 20% increase in the initial CRP concentration was associated with a 14% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1-29%) increase in the odds of death, and the hazard of death increased 14% (95% CI: 5-25%) for each 20% increase in the current CRP value. While the initial lactate concentration was not predictive of death, subsequent measurements were.

643893,Identification and validation of a novel clinical signature to predict the prognosis in confirmed COVID-19 patients,2020-06-18,"Poor communication contributes to morbidity and mortality, not only in general medical care but also at the end oflife. This leads to issues relating to symptom control and quality of care. As part of an international project focused on bereaved relatives’ perceptions about quality of end-of-life care, we undertook a quality improvement (QI) project in a general hospital in Córdoba city, Argentina. By using two iterative QI cycles, we launched an educational process and introduced a clinical mnemonic tool, I-PASS, during ward handovers. The introduction of the handover tool was intended to improve out-of-hours care. Our clinical outcome measure was ensuring comfort in at least 60% of dying patients, as perceived by family carers, during night shifts in an oncology ward during the project period (March–May 2019). As process-based measures, we selected the proportion of staff completing the I-PASS course (target 60%) and using I-PASS in at least 60% of handovers. Participatory action research was the chosen method. During the study period, 13/16 dying patients were included. We received 23 reports from family carers about the level of patient comfort during the previous night. Sixty-five per cent of healthcare professionals completed the I-PASS training. The percentage of completed handovers increased from 60% in the first Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle to 68% in the second one. The proportion of positive reports about patient comfort increased from 63% (end of the first PDSA cycle) to 87% (last iterative analysis after 3 months).

A number of reports have emerged suggesting these patients may present with signs and symptoms consistent with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction without coronary artery occlusion. CASE SUMMARY : We report an international case series of patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who presented with suspected ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Three patients with confirmed COVID-19 presented with electrocardiogram criteria for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. No patient had obstructive coronary disease at coronary angiography. Post-mortem histology in one case demonstrated myocardial ischaemia in the absence of coronary atherothrombosis or myocarditis. DISCUSSION : Patients with COVID-19 may present with features consistent with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and patent coronary arteries.

We created ReGARDD (Regulatory Guidance for Academic Research of Drugs and Devices), a regional forum initially involving regulatory professionals from four Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA)-funded institutions, to build and capitalize on local expertise and to develop a regulatory guidance website geared toward academic researchers. Since 2015, members organized 15 forums covering topics such as FDA premarket submissions, gene therapy, and intellectual property for devices and therapeutics. Through user feedback, targeted surveys, and ongoing iterative processes, we refined and maintained a shared regulatory website, which reached 6000+ users in 2019. Website updates improved navigation to drug versus device topic areas, provided new educational content and videos to address commonly asked questions, and created a portal for posting upcoming training opportunities. Survey respondents rated the website favorably and endorsed expanding ReGARDD as a centralized resource. ReGARDD strengthened the regional regulatory workforce, increased regulatory efficiency, and promulgated best organizational and operational practices. Broad-scale deployment of the ReGARDD model across the CTSA consortium may facilitate the creation of a network of regional forums and reduce gaps in access to regulatory support.","Brownley, Kimberly A.; Rape, Marie; Wood, Amanda; Dave, Gaurav; Henderson, Chad; Severynse-Stevens, Diana; Zmuda, Mike; Earp, Diane; Moody, Carmella; Kelly-Pumarol, Issis; Andrews, Joseph; Foss, Kristen M.; Fraser, Stephanie; Segear, Erika; Parrish, Amanda B.",Journal of clinical and translational science,https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2021.3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007465/,295

Knowledge management theory has the potential to support research into problems such as HIV, antibiotic resistance and others, particularly in terms of aspects of scientific research related to the contribution of social science. To date, however, these challenges remain with us, and theoretical contributions that can complement natural science efforts to eradicate these problems are needed. This paper seeks to offer a theoretical contribution grounded in Kuhn’s paradigm theory of innovation, and in the argument by Lakatos that scientific research can be fundamentally non-innovative, which suggests that social science aspects of knowledge creation may hold the key to more effective biomedical innovation. Given the consequences of ongoing and emerging global crises, and the failure of knowledge systems of scientific research to solve such problems outright, this paper provides a review of theory and literature arguing for a new paradigm in scientific research, based on the development of global systems to maximise research collaborations. A global systems approach effectively includes social science theory development as an important complement to the natural sciences research process. Arguably, information technology and social media technology have developed to the point at which solutions to knowledge aggregation challenges can enable solutions to knowledge problems on a scale hitherto unimaginable. Expert and non-expert crowdsourced inputs can enable problem-solving through exponentially increasing problem-solving inputs, using the ‘crowd,’ thereby increasing collaborations dramatically. It is argued that these developments herald a new era of participatory research, or a democratisation of research, which offers new hope for solving global social problems. This paper seeks to contribute to this end, and to the recognition of the important role of social theory in the scientific research process.","Callaghan, Chris William",SAHARA J,https://doi.org/10.1080/17290376.2017.1375426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28922967/,295

These predictions are foundational to learning, policymaking, and planning for the pandemic, and therefore understanding the relationship between age, comorbidities, and health outcomes is critical to assessing and managing public health risks. From a US government database of 1.4 million patient records collected in May 2020, we extracted the relationships between age and number of comorbidities at the individual level to predict the likelihood of hospitalization, admission to intensive care, and death. We then applied the relationships to each US state and a selection of different countries in order to see whether they predicted observed outcome rates. We found that age and comorbidity data within these geographical regions do not explain much of the international or within-country variation in hospitalization, ICU admission, or death. Identifying alternative explanations for the limited predictive power of comorbidities and age at the population level should be considered for future research.","Cegan, Jeffrey C; Trump, Benjamin D; Cibulsky, Susan M; Collier, Zachary A; Cummings, Christopher L; Greer, Scott L; Jarman, Holly; Klasa, Kasia; Kleinman, Gary; Surette, Melissa A; Wells, Emily; Linkov, Igor",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s313312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34267565/,295

There are 33 peptidase families common to archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes and are assumed to have originated in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). These include peptidases with different catalytic types, exo- and endopeptidases, peptidases with different tertiary structures and peptidases from different families but with similar structures. This implies that the different catalytic types and structures pre-date LUCA.

The purpose of this paper is to do the following: 1) provide an overview of the WHS of care in VHA and applicability in addressing employee resiliency; 2) provide a brief history of employee well-being efforts in VHA to date; 3) share new priorities from VHA leadership as they relate to Employee Whole Health strategy and implementation; and 4) provide a summary of the impacts of WHS of care delivery on employees. The WHS of care utilizes all therapeutic, evidence-based approaches to support self-care goals and personal health planning. Extending these approaches to employees builds upon 10 years of foundational work supporting employee health and well-being in VHA.

Most lethal events occur months or years after the initial presentation. Indeed, many patients experience repeated complications or require multiple interventions (recurrent events). Apart from affecting the individual, this leads to high medical costs for society. Personalized treatment strategies aiming at prediction and prevention of recurrent events rely on early diagnosis and precise prognosis. Complementing the traditional environmental and clinical risk factors, multi-omics data provide a holistic view of the patient and disease progression, enabling studies to probe novel angles in risk stratification. Specifically, predictive molecular markers allow insights into regulatory networks, pathways, and mechanisms underlying disease. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) represents a powerful, yet adaptive, framework able to recognize complex patterns in large-scale clinical and molecular data with the potential to improve risk prediction. Here, we review the most recent advances in risk prediction of recurrent cardiovascular events, and discuss the value of molecular data and biomarkers for understanding patient risk in a systems biology context.

655436,It is time to determine Tocilizumab place in COVID-19,2021-05-24,"Background: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has caused an unexpected rebound globally. The World Health Organization has listed three variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1) as variants of concern. To understand the epidemiology and thereby plan appropriate safety measures, differential identification of the variants is indeed critical. Objectives: Although whole-genome sequencing is the gold standard for variant identification, it is time-consuming and relatively expensive. Therefore, a rapid, easy, and cost-effective platform targeting multiple regions of the genome is required. Here, we assessed the usefulness of the Novaplex(TM) SARS-CoV-2 Variants I Assay kit in identifying mutations in the variants. Study design: We retrospectively examined 30 stored nasal swabs from COVID-19-positive patients tested between November 2020 and March 2021. RNA extracted from these swabs was subjected to the commercial kit and real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed. To determine the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in the collected samples and deduce the consensus sequences among the identified variants, genome sequencing libraries were prepared and mapped to the reference genome. Results: Four of the tested samples were determined as variants. Of them, two harbored both H69/V70 deletion and N501Y substitution, whereas two harbored E484K substitution alone. Conclusions: The variant with E484K substitution alone (“R.1”) has been now categorized as a variant of interest in Japan. Additionally, the kit-based assay was found to be feasible, convenient, and user-friendly in identifying the abovementioned mutations with a turnaround time of only 2 hours.","Kami, Wakaki; Kinjo, Takeshi; Arakaki, Wakako; Oki, Hiroya; Motooka, Daisuke; Nakamura, Shota; Fujita, Jiro",J Clin Virol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665322100144X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665322100144X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134034/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104877,295
655943,Case Report: Pediatric Patient with COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children,2020-09-08,"BACKGROUND: All countries face challenging decisions about healthcare coverage. Malawi has committed to achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030, the timeframe set out by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As in other low income countries, scarce resources stand in the way of more equitable health access and quality in Malawi. Its health sector is highly dependent on donor contributions, and recent poor governance of government-funded healthcare saw donors withdraw funding, limiting services and resources. The 2017 National Health Plan II and accompanying Health Strategic Plan II identify the importance of improved governance and strategies to achieve more effective cooperation with stakeholders. This study explores health sector stakeholders’ perceptions of the challenges to improving governance in Malawi’s national health system within the post-2017 context of government attempts to articulate a way forward. METHODS: A qualitative study design was used. Interviews were conducted with 22 representatives of major international and faith-based non-government organisations, civil society organisations, local government and government-funded organisations, and governance bodies operating in Malawi. Open questions were asked about experiences and perceptions of the functioning of the health system and healthcare decision-making. Content relating to healthcare governance was identified in the transcripts and field notes and analysed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Stakeholders view governance challenges as a significant barrier to achieving a more effective and equitable health system. Three categories were identified: accountability (enforceability; answerability; stakeholder-led initiatives); health resource management (healthcare financing; drug supply); influence in decision-making (unequal power; stakeholder engagement). CONCLUSIONS: Health sector stakeholders see serious political, structural, and financial challenges to improving governance in the national health system in Malawi which will impact the government’s goal of achieving UHC by 2030. Stakeholders identify the need for improved oversight, implementation, service delivery and social accountability of government-funded service providers to communities. Eighteen months after the introduction of the policy documents, they see little evidence of improved governance and have little or no confidence in the government’s ability to deliver UHC. The difficulties stakeholders perceive in relation to building equitable and effective healthcare governance in Malawi have relevance for other resource-limited countries which have also committed to the goal of UHC.

656211,The role of smart monitoring digital health care system based on smartphone application and personal health record platform for patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019,2021-02-27,"RATIONALE: Clinical trials are the gold standard for testing interventions. COVID-19 has further raised their public profile and emphasised the need to deliver better, faster, more efficient trials for patient benefit. Considerable overlap exists between data required for trials and data already collected routinely in electronic healthcare records (EHRs). Opportunities exist to use these in innovative ways to decrease duplication of effort and speed trial recruitment, conduct and follow-up. APPROACH: The National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), Health Data Research UK and Clinical Practice Research Datalink co-organised a national workshop to accelerate the agenda for ‘data-enabled clinical trials’. Showcasing successful examples and imagining future possibilities, the plenary talks, panel discussions, group discussions and case studies covered: design/feasibility; recruitment; conduct/follow-up; collecting benefits/harms; and analysis/interpretation. REFLECTION: Some notable studies have successfully accessed and used EHR to identify potential recruits, support randomised trials, deliver interventions and supplement/replace trial-specific follow-up. Some outcome measures are already reliably collected; others, like safety, need detailed work to meet regulatory reporting requirements. There is a clear need for system interoperability and a ‘route map’ to identify and access the necessary datasets. Researchers running regulatory-facing trials must carefully consider how data quality and integrity would be assessed. An experience-sharing forum could stimulate wider adoption of EHR-based methods in trial design and execution. DISCUSSION: EHR offer opportunities to better plan clinical trials, assess patients and capture data more efficiently, reducing research waste and increasing focus on each trial’s specific challenges. The short-term emphasis should be on facilitating patient recruitment and for postmarketing authorisation trials where research-relevant outcome measures are readily collectable. Sharing of case studies is encouraged. The workshop directly informed NIHR’s funding call for ambitious data-enabled trials at scale. There is the opportunity for the UK to build upon existing data science capabilities to identify, recruit and monitor patients in trials at scale.","Sydes, Matthew R; Barbachano, Yolanda; Bowman, Louise; Denwood, Tom; Farmer, Andrew; Garfield-Birkbeck, Steph; Gibson, Martin; Gulliford, Martin C; Harrison, David A; Hewitt, Catherine; Logue, Jennifer; Navaie, Will; Norrie, John; O'Kane, Martin; Quint, Jennifer K; Rycroft-Malone, Jo; Sheffield, Jonathan; Smeeth, Liam; Sullivan, Frank; Tizzard, Juliet; Walker, Paula; Wilding, John; Williamson, Paula R; Landray, Martin; Morris, Andrew; Walker, Rhoswyn R; Williams, Hywel C; Valentine, Janet",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34135032/,295

Of these, Middle East respiratory s yndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the only zoonotic coronavirus that is known to consistently result in frequent zoonotic spillover events from the proximate reservoir host—the dromedary camel. A comprehensive understanding of infection in dromedaries is critical to informing public health recommendations and implementing intervention strategies to mitigate spillover events. Experimental models of reservoir disease are absolutely critical in understanding the pathogenesis and transmission, and are key to testing potential dromedary vaccines against MERS-CoV. In this review, we describe experimental infections of dromedary camels as well as additional camelid models used to further understand the camel’s role in MERS-CoV spillover to humans.","Adney, Danielle R.; Clancy, Chad S.; Bowen, Richard A.; Munster, Vincent J.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33266124/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12121370,295

We exploit large-scale, longitudinal, and representative surveys for 12 countries over the period from March to December 2020, and we complement the analysis with experimental data. We find that trust in scientists is the key driving force behind individual support for and compliance with NPIs and for favorable attitudes toward vaccination. The effect of trust in government is more ambiguous and tends to diminish support for and compliance with NPIs in countries where the recommendations from scientists and the government were not aligned. Trust in others also has seemingly paradoxical effects: in countries where social trust is high, the support for NPIs is low due to higher expectations that others will voluntary social distance. Our individual-level longitudinal data also allows us to evaluate the effects of within-person changes in trust over the pandemic: we show that trust levels and, in particular, trust in scientists have changed dramatically for individuals and within countries, with important subsequent effects on compliant behavior and support for NPIs. Such findings point out the challenging but critical need to maintain trust in scientists during a lasting pandemic that strains citizens and governments.","Algan, Yann; Cohen, Daniel; Davoine, Eva; Foucault, Martial; Stantcheva, Stefanie",Proc.

However, the risk factors associated with COVID-19-related mortality remain controversial. Methods: A total of 245 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from two centers were analyzed. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and the Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to compare the clinical characteristics between the survivors and non-survivors. To explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death, univariable and multivariable cox regression analyses were used. Results: Of the 245 patients included in this study, 23 (9.4%) died in the hospital. The multivariate regression analysis showed increased odds of in-hospital deaths associated with age, D-dimer levels >1,000 ng/L, platelet count <125, and higher serum creatinine levels.

Little is known about IL-32 production by exogenous pathogens infection in human individuals. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, we found that IL-32 level was increased by 58.2% in the serum samples from a cohort of 108 patients infected by influenza A virus comparing to that of 115 healthy individuals. Another pro-inflammatory factor cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-associated prostaglandin E2 was also upregulated by 2.7-fold. Expression of IL-32 in influenza A virus infected A549 human lung epithelial cells was blocked by either selective COX-2 inhibitor NS398 or Aspirin, a known anti-inflammatory drug, indicating IL-32 was induced through COX-2 in the inflammatory cascade. Interestingly, we found that COX-2-associate PGE(2) production activated by influenza virus infection was significantly suppressed by over-expression of IL-32 but increased by IL-32-specific siRNA, suggesting there was a feedback mechanism between IL-32 and COX-2. CONCLUSIONS: IL-32 is induced by influenza A virus infection via COX-2 in the inflammatory cascade. Our results provide that IL-32 is a potential target for anti-inflammatory medicine screening.","Li, Wei; Liu, Yan; Mukhtar, Muhammad Mahmood; Gong, Rui; Pan, Ying; Rasool, Sahibzada T.; Gao, Yecheng; Kang, Lei; Hao, Qian; Peng, Guiqing; Chen, Yanni; Chen, Xin; Wu, Jianguo; Zhu, Ying",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18414668/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001985,295

We surveilled RNA viruses inhabiting eight species (representing four families) of holothurian collected from four geographically distinct locations by viral metagenomics, including a single specimen of Apostichopus californicus affected by a hitherto undocumented wasting disease. The RNA virome comprised genome fragments of both single-stranded positive sense and double stranded RNA viruses, including those assigned to the Picornavirales, Ghabrivirales, and Amarillovirales. We discovered an unconventional flavivirus genome fragment which was most similar to a shark virus. Ghabivirales-like genome fragments were most similar to fungal totiviruses in both genome architecture and homology and had likely infected mycobiome constituents. Picornavirales, which are commonly retrieved in host-associated viral metagenomes, were similar to invertebrate transcriptome-derived picorna-like viruses. The greatest number of viral genome fragments was recovered from the wasting A. californicus library compared to the asymptomatic A. californicus library. However, reads from the asymptomatic library recruited to nearly all recovered wasting genome fragments, suggesting that they were present but not well represented in the grossly normal specimen. These results expand the known host range of flaviviruses and suggest that fungi and their viruses may play a role in holothurian ecology.","Hewson, Ian; Johnson, Mitchell R.; Tibbetts, Ian R.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32972018/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12091057,295

METHODS: Detailed clinical data including clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, imaging features and treatments of 1190 cases of adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Associations between sex and clinical outcomes were identified by multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: There were 635 (53.4%) male and 555 (46.6%) female patients in this study. Higher rates of acute kidney injury (5.5% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.026), acute cardiac injury (9.1% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.001), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (2.5% vs. 0.7%, P = 0.024) were observed in males. Compared with female patients, male patients with COVID-19 had a higher inhospital mortality rate (15.7% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.005).

663002,COVID-19 VACCINE: THE CHALLENGE OF HERBAL MEDICINE COMMUNITY BELIEF IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY – LETTER TO THE EDITOR,2021-03-18,"Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and on surfaces is critical to prevent the fecal-oral and fomite transmission, respectively. We hypothesized that visible light active photocatalysts could dramatically enhance the rate or extent of virus inactivation and enable the use of visible light rather than shorter wavelength ultraviolet light. A novel visible light active photocatalyst, boron-doped bismuth oxybromide (B-BiOBr), was synthesized and tested for its SARS-CoV-2 inactivation towards Vero E6 cell lines in dark and under irradiation at 426 nm by a light emitting diode (LED) in water. SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in the presence of B-BiOBr (0.8 g/L) under LED irradiation reached 5.32-log in 5 min, which was 400 to 10,000 times higher than those achieved with conventional photocatalysts of tungsten or titanium oxide nanomaterials, respectively. Even without LED irradiation, B-BiOBr inactivated 3.32-log of SARS-CoV-2 in the dark due to the ability of bismuth ions interfering with the SARS-CoV-2 helicase function. LED irradiation at 426 nm alone, without the photocatalyst, contributed to 10% of the observed inactivation and was attributed to production of reactive oxygen species due to blue-light photoexcitation of molecules in the culture media, which opens further modes of action to engineer disinfection strategies. The visible light active B-BiOBr photocatalyst, with its rapid SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in the presence and absence of light, holds tremendous opportunities to build a healthy environment by preventing the fecal-oral and fomite transmission of emerging pathogens.","Ling, Li; Carletti, Tea; Cheng, Zihang; Wang, Ruixuan; Ren, Yanxiao; Westerhoff, Paul; Shang, Chii; Marcello, Alessandro; Chen, Shuyu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.09.434359,295
665722,WHO guidance to support HIV care models during the Covid-19 era,2021-09-24,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is associated with a prothrombotic state leading to adverse clinical outcomes. Whether therapeutic anticoagulation improves outcomes in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 is unknown. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of therapeutic versus prophylactic anticoagulation in this population. METHODS: We did a pragmatic, open-label (with blinded adjudication), multicentre, randomised, controlled trial, at 31 sites in Brazil. Patients (aged ≥18 years) hospitalised with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer concentration, and who had COVID-19 symptoms for up to 14 days before randomisation, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation. Therapeutic anticoagulation was in-hospital oral rivaroxaban (20 mg or 15 mg daily) for stable patients, or initial subcutaneous enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice per day) or intravenous unfractionated heparin (to achieve a 0·3–0·7 IU/mL anti-Xa concentration) for clinically unstable patients, followed by rivaroxaban to day 30. Prophylactic anticoagulation was standard in-hospital enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin. The primary efficacy outcome was a hierarchical analysis of time to death, duration of hospitalisation, or duration of supplemental oxygen to day 30, analysed with the win ratio method (a ratio >1 reflects a better outcome in the therapeutic anticoagulation group) in the intention-to-treat population. The primary safety outcome was major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding through 30 days. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04394377) and is completed. FINDINGS: From June 24, 2020, to Feb 26, 2021, 3331 patients were screened and 615 were randomly allocated (311 [50%] to the therapeutic anticoagulation group and 304 [50%] to the prophylactic anticoagulation group). 576 (94%) were clinically stable and 39 (6%) clinically unstable. One patient, in the therapeutic group, was lost to follow-up because of withdrawal of consent and was not included in the primary analysis. The primary efficacy outcome was not different between patients assigned therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation, with 28 899 (34·8%) wins in the therapeutic group and 34 288 (41·3%) in the prophylactic group (win ratio 0·86 [95% CI 0·59–1·22], p=0·40). Consistent results were seen in clinically stable and clinically unstable patients. The primary safety outcome of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding occurred in 26 (8%) patients assigned therapeutic anticoagulation and seven (2%) assigned prophylactic anticoagulation (relative risk 3·64 [95% CI 1·61–8·27], p=0·0010). Allergic reaction to the study medication occurred in two (1%) patients in the therapeutic anticoagulation group and three (1%) in the prophylactic anticoagulation group. INTERPRETATION: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer concentration, in-hospital therapeutic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or enoxaparin followed by rivaroxaban to day 30 did not improve clinical outcomes and increased bleeding compared with prophylactic anticoagulation. Therefore, use of therapeutic-dose rivaroxaban, and other direct oral anticoagulants, should be avoided in these patients in the absence of an evidence-based indication for oral anticoagulation.

Therefore, in a bid to answer a burning question of reinfection in the recovered class, the model equations which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium (E_0 ) state for COVID-19 coronavirus was developed in this study and was discovered to both exist as well as satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number R_0=0 for and endemic situation. Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes, that is, B=0. Furthermore, numerical simulations were carried to complement the analytical results in investigating the effect of the implementation of quarantine and observatory procedures has on the projection of the further spread of the virus globally. Result shows that the proportion of infected population in the absence of curative vaccination will continue to grow globally meanwhile the recovery rate will continue slowly which therefore means that the ratio of infection to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded globally and most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.","Victor, Alexander Okhuese",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050930,295

INTRODUCTION: Purposes of the study were to analyze if COVID-19 pandemic influences the incidence of arm, forearm, and hip osteoporotic fractures and to estimate the changes in costs of their management. METHODS: Data on arm, forearm, and hip fracture incidence were collected for inhabitants aged over 50 years in the district of Tarnowskie Góry and the city of Piekary Śląskie, South Poland, in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic (77 days, from March 16th to May 31st 2020). These results were compared with the number of fractures noted in years 2015–2019 in the same period of the year. The ratio of analyzed fractures per 100,000 inhabitants was calculated. RESULTS: The recorded numbers of fractures of arm, forearm, and hip were 13, 43, and 29, respectively. The respective mean number for fractures reported in corresponding period in 2015–2019 years was 23.6, 52, and 33. The year fracture incidence calculated per 100,000 inhabitants decreased by 45.8%, 18.4%, and 13.4%, respectively. The estimated numbers of avoided fractures extrapolated for the whole country for arm, forearm, and hip were 1722, 1548, and 947, respectively. The total number of avoided fractures was 4217. The expected nationwide cost reduction for the arm, forearm, and hip fracture management was estimated at € 568,260, € 332,820, and € 1,628,840, respectively. The total cost reduction was € 2,529,920 over the period of observation. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease of arm, forearm, and hip fracture incidence was observed which may result in decrease of total costs for Polish healthcare system.","Pluskiewicz, W.; Wilk, R.; Adamczyk, P.; Hajzyk, M.; Swoboda, M.; Sladek, A.; Koczy, B.",Osteoporos Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33515269/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-020-05811-4,295

In Spain, the state of alarm was established from March 15 to June 20, 2020. Usually this fact decreased people’s mobility and physical activity, in addition to producing or exacerbating psychological disorders. Our aim was to determine the influence that this condition had over the short-term ponderal results of patients undergoing laparoscopic vertical gastrectomy from May 2019 to May 2020. Methods: Case-control study for comparing the percentage of excess weight lost (%EWL) and the percentage of total weight lost (%TWL) of patients that underwent a VG during the last year, so they were affected by lockdown in April and part of March 2020 (group 1), to the %EWL and %TWL of a control group (group 2), obtained from our previous series. Results: The mean %EWL in group 1 is 47,37 +/- 18,59 and in group 2 is 51,13 +/- 17,59, being p=0,438. Meanwhile, the mean %TWL in group 1 is 21,14 +/- 8,17 and in group 2 is 24,67 +/- 8,01, with p=0,115. Conclusions: Population lockdown by COVID-19 did not get worse short-term results of vertical gastrectomy.

While vaccination is available against the major cancer-causing HPV types, many others are not covered by these preventive measures. Herein, we present a bioinformatics study for the designing of multivalent peptide vaccines against multiple HPV types as an alternative strategy to the virus-like particle vaccines being used now. Our technique of rational design of peptide vaccines is expected to ensure stability of the vaccine against many cycles of mutational changes, elicit immune response, and negate autoimmune possibilities. Using the L1 capsid protein sequences, we identified several peptides for potential vaccine design for HPV 16, 18, 33, 35, 45, and 11 types. Although there are concerns about the epitope-binding affinities for the peptides identified in this process, the technique indicates possibilities of multivalent, adjuvanted, peptide vaccines against a wider range of HPV types, and tailor-made different combinations of the peptides to address frequency variations of types over different population groups as required for prophylaxis and at lower cost than are in use at the present time.","Dey, Sumanta; De, Antara; Nandy, Ashesh",Cancer Inform,https://doi.org/10.4137/cin.s39071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27279731/,295

According to the current case reports and cohort studies, the symptoms of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to normal adults and may cause a series of adverse consequences of pregnancy (placental abruption, fetal distress, epilepsy during pregnancy, etc.). However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to the fetus through the placental barrier is still a focus of debate. MethodsIn this study, in order to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 infect fetus through placental barrier, we performed qualitative detection of virus structural protein (spike protein and nucleoprotein) and targeted receptor protein (ACE2, CD147 and GRP78) expression on the placental tissue of seven pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 through immunohistochemistry. Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat, anal swab and breastmilk samples were collected immediately in the operating room for verification after delivery, which were all tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: The result showed that CD147 was expressed on the basal side of the chorionic trophoblast cell membrane and ACE2 was expressed on the maternal side, while GRP78 was strongly expressed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. The RT-PCR results of Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat, anal swab and breastmilk samples were all negative. Conclusions: We believed that despite the detection of viral structural proteins in the placenta, SARS-CoV-2 cannot be transmitted to infants due to the presence of the placental barrier.","Dong, L.; Pei, S.; Ren, Q.; Fu, S.; Yu, L.; Chen, H.; Chen, X.; Yin, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248874v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.28.20248874,295
679764,A Five-day Course of Ivermectin may Reduce the Duration of COVID-19 Illness,2021-07-26,"Interleukin-22 (IL-22), a member of the IL-10 superfamily, plays essential roles in fighting against mucosal microbial infection and maintaining mucosal barrier integrity within the intestine. However, little knowledge exists on the ability of porcine IL-22 (pIL-22) to fight against viral infection in the gut. In this study, we found that recombinant mature pIL-22 (mpIL-22) inhibited the infection of multiple diarrhea viruses, including alpha coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine rotavirus (PoRV), in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line J2 (IPEC-J2) cells. mpIL-22 up-regulated the expression of the antimicrobial peptide beta-defensin (BD-2), cytokine IL-18 and IFN-λ. Furthermore, we found that mpIL-22 induced phosphorylation of STAT3 on Ser727 and Tyr705 in IPEC-J2 cells. Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by S3I-201 abrogated the antiviral ability of mpIL-22 and the mpIL-22-induced expression of BD-2, IL-18, and IFN-λ. Together, mpIL-22 inhibited the infection of PoRV and enteric coronaviruses, and up-regulated the expression of antimicrobial genes in IPEC-J2, which were mediated by the activation of the STAT3 signal pathway. The significant antiviral activity of IL-22 to curtail multiple enteric diarrhea viruses in vitro suggests that pIL-22 could be a novel therapeutic against devastating viral diarrhea in piglets.","Xue, Mei; Zhao, Jing; Ying, Lan; Fu, Fang; Li, Lin; Ma, Yanlong; Shi, Hongyan; Zhang, Jiaoer; Feng, Li; Liu, Pinghuang",Antiviral Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216306672; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216306672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28322925/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.03.006,295

We conducted a cross-sectional global study to assess dermatologists’ responses to virtual conference and e-learning program attendance, as well as to discuss the status of such events during the pandemic. This web-based, global survey included 733 dermatologists. Primary outcomes are percentages of responders answering questions. Assessment of the relationship between two categorical variables was performed with the chi-square test. A substantial percentage of responders were willing to attend a virtual meeting (70.6%) or webinar (80.2%), or to conduct a webinar (47.3%). Among participants who provided resident or fellow training before the pandemic, 38% responded that they did not have any teaching systems in place during the pandemic. Virtual conference attendance was significantly associated with video conference attendance before the pandemic, webinar attendance, teledermatology (TD) use during the pandemic, future TD use, having training systems in place for residents or fellows (P < .001 for each), and North American location of participant (P = .001).

This novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with a respiratory illness that may lead to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which to date are not completely understood. AIMS: To provide a review of the differences in pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19, SARS and MERS. SOURCES: The most recent literature in the English language regarding COVID-19 has been reviewed, and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about SARS and MERS epidemics. CONTENT: COVID-19 seems not to be very different from SARS regarding its clinical features. However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and much lower than that of MERS (34.4%). The possibility cannot be excluded that because of the less severe clinical picture of COVID-19 it can spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS. The actual basic reproductive number (R(0)) of COVID-19 (2.0–2.5) is still controversial. It is probably slightly higher than the R(0) of SARS (1.7–1.9) and higher than that of MERS (<1). A gastrointestinal route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, which has been assumed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cannot be ruled out and needs further investigation. IMPLICATIONS: There is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially as concerns mortality and its capacity to spread on a pandemic level. Nonetheless, all of the lessons we learned in the past from the SARS and MERS epidemics are the best cultural weapons with which to face this new global threat.","Petrosillo, N.; Viceconte, G.; Ergonul, O.; Ippolito, G.; Petersen, E.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20301713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32234451/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20301713,295

However, in this study, we wanted to explore the possibility of using IL-1β to improve the prognosis of sepsis by triggering local differentiation of bone marrow cells (BMCs) into regulatory dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo, thereby reversing the immune paralysis in late-phase sepsis. Sepsis mouse models were induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and lethal Escherichia coli O18 infection. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with IL-1β after CLP and after the lethal infection. Septic BMCs and liver immune cells were isolated at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 14 days post-CLP. BMCs and liver cells isolated from septic mice treated with IL-1β were adoptively transferred into CLP mice. GFP(+)-C57BL/6 parabiosis models were established. Serum IL-1β levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, and the number, ratio, and phenotype of immune cells were observed by flow cytometry. IL-1β treatment improved the survival of sepsis and increased the numbers of BMCs and liver immune cells in septic mice. Moreover, IL-1β stimulation increased the number and the percentage of CD11c(−)CD45RB(high) DCs in septic BM and liver. Adoptive transfer of septic BMCs, liver immune cells, and CD11c(−)CD45RB(high) DCs treated with IL-1β into CLP mice attenuated sepsis. IL-1β triggered the redistribution of CD11c(−)CD45RB(high) DCs as well as BMCs in parabiosis models. IL-1β protects against sepsis by stimulating local proliferation and differentiation of BMCs into CD11c(−)CD45RB(high) DCs at immune organs and non-immune organs.

The application of computer-aided diagnosis technology can reduce the burden on doctors, which is conducive to rapid and large-scale diagnostic screening. In this paper, we proposed an automatic detection method for COVID-19 based on spatiotemporal information fusion. Using the segmentation network in the deep learning method to segment the lung area and the lesion area, the spatiotemporal information features of multiple CT scans are extracted to perform auxiliary diagnosis analysis. The performance of this method was verified on the collected dataset. We achieved the classification of COVID-19 CT scans and non-COVID-19 CT scans and analyzed the development of the patients' condition through the CT scans.

Mindfulness-based interventions have shown effectiveness in reducing stress and fostering resilience and recovery in healthcare workers. There are no studies examining the feasibility of brief mindfulness-based interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak. Materials and Methods: This is an exploratory study with a post intervention assessment. We describe an on-site brief mindfulness intervention and evaluate its helpfulness, safety, and feasibility. Results: One thousand out of 7,000 (14%) healthcare workers from La Paz University Hospital in Madrid (Spain) participated in at least one session. One hundred and fifty out of 1,000 (15%) participants filled out a self-report questionnaire evaluating the helpfulness of the intervention for on-site stress reduction. Ninety two subjects (61%) participated in more than one session. Most of the participants were women (80%) with a mean age of 38.6 years. Almost half of the sample were nurses (46%). Sessions were perceived as being helpful with a mean rating of 8.4 on a scale from 0 to 10. Only 3 people (2%) reported a minor adverse effect (increased anxiety or dizziness). Discussion: Our data supports the utility, safety and feasibility of an on-site, brief mindfulness-based intervention designed to reduce stress for frontline health workers during a crisis.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients at an ambulatory cancer center with URI diagnoses from 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016. We obtained antimicrobial prescribing, respiratory viral testing, and other clinical data at first encounter for the URI through day 14. We used generalized estimating equations to test associations of baseline factors with antibiotic prescribing. RESULTS: Of 341 charts reviewed, 251 (74%) patients were eligible for analysis. Nearly one-third (32%) of patients were prescribed antibiotics for URIs. Respiratory viruses were detected among 85 (75%) of 113 patients tested. Antibiotic prescribing (P = .001) and viral testing (P < .001) varied by clinical service. Sputum production or chest congestion was associated with higher risk of antibiotic prescribing (relative risk [RR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4–3.8; P < .001). Viral testing on day 0 was associated with lower risk of antibiotic prescribing (RR, 0.4; 95% CI 0.2–0.8; P = .01), though collinearity between viral testing and clinical service limited our ability to separate these effects on prescribing. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-third of hematology–oncology outpatients were prescribed antibiotics for URIs, despite viral etiologies identified among 75% of those tested. Antibiotic prescribing was significantly lower among patients who received an initial respiratory viral test. The role of viral testing in antibiotic prescribing for URIs in outpatient oncology settings merits further study.","Krantz, Elizabeth M; Zier, Jacqlynn; Stohs, Erica; Ogimi, Chikara; Sweet, Ania; Marquis, Sara; Klaassen, John; Pergam, Steven A; Liu, Catherine",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciz409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095276/,295

The purpose of this study was evaluation of appropriate and safe disposal of sharps within a 730-bed acute district general hospital (DGH) in the UK. One hundred sharps containers were audited in November 2019 to assess whether they complied with the health and safety regulations across surgical, medical, and acute wards. Meetings with the appropriate staff members were organised and posters placed throughout the hospital to raise awareness. One hundred twenty-five sharps containers were re-audited in July 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic to ascertain if there was an improvement. In November 2019, a total of 56% of sharps containers were overfilled and hence were non-compliant with safety regulations. A re-audit performed in July 2020 found only 17% of sharps containers to be overfilled, which was a significant improvement (p = 0.0064) in practice. We noted that the overall compliance improved from being 44% in 2019 to 82.64 in the year 2020. This audit showed a significant improvement in the compliance of sharps bin containers in a DGH, signifying the increased awareness.

There are several reasons for these disparities, and one possible contributor is provider perceptions of Asian Americans, which in turn can affect their medical decision making when treating Asian American patients. There is evidence for the influence of provider perceptions on medical decision making among patients of other racial minority groups; however, literature on Asian American patients is lacking. The present paper addresses this gap in the literature by using social cognitive theory to outline the mechanisms through which provider perception of Asian American patients can affect diagnostic and treatment decisions. These mechanisms include stereotypes and implicit biases, illusory correlations, and cognitive load. Recommendations for future research and policy development are provided.","Ho, Ivy K.; Lawrence, Jason S.",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32926390/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-020-00867-8,295
686737,"Microbiota and Covid-19. Which came first, the chicken or the egg?",2020-07-10,"SARS‐CoV‐2 serological assays are urgently needed for rapid diagnosis, contact tracing and for epidemiological studies. So far, there is limited data on how commercially available tests perform with real patient samples and if positive tested samples show neutralizing abilities. Focusing on IgG antibodies, we demonstrate the performance of two ELISA assays (Euroimmun SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG and Vircell COVID‐19 ELISA IgG) in comparison to one lateral flow assay ((LFA) FaStep COVID‐19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device) and two in‐house developed assays (immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)). We tested follow up serum/plasma samples of individuals PCR‐diagnosed with COVID‐19. Most of the SARS‐CoV‐2 samples were from individuals with moderate to severe clinical course, who required an in‐patient hospital stay. For all examined assays, the sensitivity ranged from 58.8 to 76.5% for the early phase of infection (days 5‐9) and from 93.8 to 100% for the later period (days 10‐18). With exception of one sample, all positive tested COVID‐19 follow up‐samples, using the commercially available assays examined (including the in‐house developed IFA), demonstrated neutralizing properties in the PRNT. Regarding specificity, some samples of endemic coronavirus (HCoV‐OC43, HCoV‐229E) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infected individuals cross‐reacted in the ELISA assays and IFA, in one case generating a false positive result.

In particular, the growth rate of the infection has been fitted as an exponential decay, as compared to a linear decay, reported previously. The model has been validated with the data of China and South Korea, where the pandemic is nearing to its end. The data of Italy, Germany, Spain, and Sweden show that the peak of the infection has reached i.e. a time when the new infections will start to decrease as compared to the previous day. The model predicts the approximate number of total infections at the end of the outbreak. The model prediction of the USA, and Brazil show that the peak will reach in the next two-three weeks. The total number of infections in the USA is estimated to be around 4 million by the model. The reported data of India show the start of disease evolution, with a large initial scatter in the growth rate. The possible peak date and the total number of infections are predicted using the data available.","Bhardwaj, Rajneesh",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063271,295
687356,Providing safe care for patients in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era: A case series evaluating risk for hospital-associated COVID-19,2021-04-05,"Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic disease (COVID-19) that has spread globally causing more than 30,000 deaths. Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis. What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients; assessed since the 4th-6th day of illness onset, such increases seem to be predictive of an adverse prognosis. Our hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities. TZD are PPARγ agonists that act on nuclear receptors, thereby triggering certain transcription factors. TZD were widely used for type-2 diabetes in the first decade of this century and although concerns have been raised for possible side effects associated with long-term treatment, their use has been recently revaluated for their anti-inflammatory properties in numerous medical conditions.","Carboni, Elena; Carta, Anna Rosa; Carboni, Ezio",Med Hypotheses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344313/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720306186?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720306186; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109776,295
688663,Pasteurized blood samples for transfusion compatibility testing during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak,2020-04-16,"With over 117 million COVID-19–positive cases declared and the death count approaching 3 million, we would expect that the highly digitalized health systems of high-income countries would have collected, processed, and analyzed large quantities of clinical data from patients with COVID-19. Those data should have served to answer important clinical questions such as: what are the risk factors for becoming infected? What are good clinical variables to predict prognosis? What kinds of patients are more likely to survive mechanical ventilation? Are there clinical subphenotypes of the disease? All these, and many more, are crucial questions to improve our clinical strategies against the epidemic and save as many lives as possible. One might assume that in the era of big data and machine learning, there would be an army of scientists crunching petabytes of clinical data to answer these questions. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Our health systems have proven to be completely unprepared to generate, in a timely manner, a flow of clinical data that could feed these analyses. Despite gigabytes of data being generated every day, the vast quantity is locked in secure hospital data servers and is not being made available for analysis. Routinely collected clinical data are, by and large, regarded as a tool to inform decisions about individual patients, and not as a key resource to answer clinical questions through statistical analysis. The initiatives to extract COVID-19 clinical data are often promoted by private groups of individuals and not by health systems, and are uncoordinated and inefficient. The consequence is that we have more clinical data on COVID-19 than on any other epidemic in history, but we have failed to analyze this information quickly enough to make a difference. In this viewpoint, we expose this situation and suggest concrete ideas that health systems could implement to dynamically analyze their routine clinical data, becoming learning health systems and reversing the current situation.","Prieto-Merino, David; Bebiano Da Providencia E Costa, Rui; Bacallao Gallestey, Jorge; Sofat, Reecha; Chung, Sheng-Chia; Potts, Henry",JMIRx Med,https://doi.org/10.2196/20617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34042100/,295
689872,Comparison of clinical severity and epidemiological spectrum between coronavirus disease 2019 and influenza in children,2021-03-11,"INTRODUCTION: During the Covid-19 pandemic, major journals have published a significant number of Covid-19 related articles in a short period of time. While this is necessary to combat the worldwide pandemic, it may have trade-offs with respect to publishing research from other disciplines. OBJECTIVES: To assess differences in published research design before and after the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional review of all 322 full-length research studies published between October 1, 2019 and April 30, 2020 in three major medical journals. We compared the number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and studies with a control group before and after January 31, 2020, when Covid-19 began garnering international attention. RESULTS: The number of full-length research studies per issue was not statistically different before and after the Covid-19 pandemic (from 3.7 to 3.5 per issue, p = 0.17). Compared to before January 31, 2020, 0.7 fewer non-Covid-19 studies per issue were published versus after January 31, 2020 (p<0.001), a change that was offset by Covid-19 studies. Among non-Covid-19 studies, 0.9 fewer studies with a control group per issue were published after January 31, 2020, with RCTs contributing to nearly all the decline (p<0.001, p = 0.001, respectively). In the same timeframe, non-Covid-19 studies without a control group and non-Covid-19 studies without randomization experienced relatively small changes that did not meet our threshold for statistical significance (increases of 0.1 and 0.1 per issue, p = 0.80, p = 0.88, respectively). LIMITATIONS: Using a simple heuristic for assessing research design and lack of generalizability to the general medical literature. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the increase in Covid-19 studies coincided with a decrease of mostly non-Covid-19 RCTs.","Bian, Shelly X.; Lin, Eugene",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32913357/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238831,295
689956,"Epidemiology, outcomes and associated factors of COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases in the San Pedro Sula Metropolitan Area, Honduras",2020-08-17,"Background: Analyses of correlates of SARS-CoV-2 infection or mortality have usually assessed individual predictors. This study aimed to determine if patterns of combined predictors may better identify risk of infection and mortality. Methods: For the period of March 2nd to 10th 2020, the first 9 days of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia, we selected all 18 confirmed cases, of which 6 died, and all 60 suspected cases, of which 1 died; and 28 putatively negative patients with pneumonia and no travel history. We recorded data for travel, contact history, symptoms, haematology, comorbidities, and chest x-ray. Hierarchical cluster analyses (HCA) and principal component analyses (PCA) identified cluster and covariance patterns for symptoms or haematology which were analysed with other predictors of infection or mortality using logistic regression. Results: For univariate analyses, no significant association with infection was seen for fever, cough, dyspnoea, headache, runny nose, sore throat, gastrointestinal complaints (GIC), or haematology. A PCA symptom component for fever, cough, and GIC tended to increase risk of infection (OR 3.41; 95% CI 1.06 - 14; p=0.06), and a haematology component with elevated monocytes decreased risk (OR 0.26; 0.07 - 0.79; 0.027). Multivariate analysis revealed that an HCA cluster of 3-5 symptoms, typically fever, cough, headache, runny nose, sore throat but little dyspnoea and no GIC tended to reduce risk (aOR 0.048; <0.001 - 0.52; 0.056). In univariate analyses for death, an HCA cluster of cough, fever and dyspnoea had increased risk (OR 5.75; 1.06 - 31.3, 0.043), but no other individual predictor, cluster or component was associated. Other significant predictors of infection were age >= 45, international travel, contact with COVID-19 patient, and pneumonia. Diabetes and history of contact were associated with higher mortality. Conclusions: Cluster groups and co-variance patterns may be stronger correlates of SARS-CoV-2 infection than individual predictors. Comorbidities may warrant careful attention as would COVID-19 exposure levels.","Burhan, E.; Syam, A. F.; Rahyussalim, A. J.; Prasenohadi, P.; Wulung, N. G. L.; Susanto, A. D.; Sajinadiyasa, I. G.
