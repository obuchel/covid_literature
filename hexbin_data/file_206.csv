2960,2960,2960,Multicentre randomised controlled trial to investigate the usefulness of continuous pneumatic regulation of tracheal cuff pressure for reducing ventilator-associated pneumonia in mechanically ventilated severe trauma patients: the AGATE study protocol,20.231888,9.7545805,2017-08-07,"INTRODUCTION: Severe trauma represents the leading cause of mortality worldwide. While 80% of deaths occur within the first 24 hours after trauma, 20% occur later and are mainly due to healthcare-associated infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Preventing underinflation of the tracheal cuff is recommended to reduce microaspiration, which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of VAP. Automatic devices facilitate the regulation of tracheal cuff pressure, and their implementation has the potential to reduce VAP. The objective of this work is to determine whether continuous regulation of tracheal cuff pressure using a pneumatic device reduces the incidence of VAP compared with intermittent control in severe trauma patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre randomised controlled and open-label trial will include patients suffering from severe trauma who are admitted within the first 24 hours, who require invasive mechanical ventilation to longer than 48 hours. Their tracheal cuff pressure will be monitored either once every 8 hours (control group) or continuously using a pneumatic device (intervention group). The primary end point is the proportion of patients that develop VAP in the intensive care unit (ICU) at day 28. The secondary end points include the proportion of patients that develop VAP in the ICU, early (≤7 days) or late (>7 days) VAP, time until the first VAP diagnosis, the number of ventilator-free days and antibiotic-free days, the length of stay in the ICU, the proportion of patients with ventilator-associated events and that die during their ICU stay. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been approved by the ethics committee of Poitiers University Hospital, and will be carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The results of this study will be disseminated through presentation at scientific conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals.

4352,4352,4352,The effect of therapeutic drug monitoring of beta-lactam and fluoroquinolones on clinical outcome in critically ill patients: the DOLPHIN trial protocol of a multi-centre randomised controlled trial,19.894789,9.702846,2020-01-17,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients undergo extensive physiological alterations that will have impact on antibiotic pharmacokinetics. Up to 60% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients meet the pharmacodynamic targets of beta-lactam antibiotics, with only 30% in fluoroquinolones. Not reaching these targets might increase the chance of therapeutic failure, resulting in increased mortality and morbidity, and antibiotic resistance. The DOLPHIN trial was designed to demonstrate the added value of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of beta-lactam and fluoroquinolones in critically ill patients in the ICU. METHODS: A multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) was designed to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of model-based TDM of beta-lactam and fluoroquinolones. Four hundred fifty patients will be included within 24 months after start of inclusion. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to either study group: the intervention group (active TDM) or the control group (non-TDM). In the intervention group dose adjustment of the study antibiotics (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, flucloxacillin, piperacillin with tazobactam, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin) on day 1, 3, and 5 is performed based upon TDM with a Bayesian model. The primary outcome will be ICU length of stay. Other outcomes amongst all survival, disease severity, safety, quality of life after ICU discharge, and cost effectiveness will be included. DISCUSSION: No trial has investigated the effect of early TDM of beta-lactam and fluoroquinolones on clinical outcome in critically ill patients. The findings from the DOLPHIN trial will possibly lead to new insights in clinical management of critically ill patients receiving antibiotics. In short, to TDM or not to TDM?

The currently available vaccine (inactivated bacterin in oil base) is not effective in preventing pathogen shedding and is rarely used to control Johne’s disease in dairy herds. To develop a better vaccine that can prevent the spread of Johne’s disease, we utilized polyanhydride nanoparticles (PAN) to encapsulate mycobacterial antigens composed of whole cell lysate (PAN-Lysate) and culture filtrate (PAN-Cf) of M. paratuberculosis. These nanoparticle-based vaccines (i.e., nanovaccines) were well tolerated in mice causing no inflammatory lesions at the site of injection. Immunological assays demonstrated a substantial increase in the levels of antigen-specific T cell responses post-vaccination in the PAN-Cf vaccinated group as indicated by high percentages of triple cytokine (IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α) producing CD8(+) T cells. Following challenge, animals vaccinated with PAN-Cf continued to produce significant levels of double (IFN-γ, TNF-α) and single cytokine (IFN-γ) secreting CD8(+) T cells compared with animals vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine. A significant reduction in bacterial load was observed in multiple organs of animals vaccinated with PAN-Cf, which is a clear indication of protection. Overall, the use of polyanhydride nanovaccines resulted in development of protective and sustained immunity against Johne’s disease, an approach that could be applied to counter other intracellular pathogens.","Thukral, Akanksha; Ross, Kathleen; Hansen, Chungyi; Phanse, Yashdeep; Narasimhan, Balaji; Steinberg, Howard; Talaat, Adel M.",NPJ Vaccines,206,1

Next, we propose a cost–benefit analysis to discuss the cost-effectiveness of this measure. We find that over three-quarters of respondents report complying with home confinement. Their choice depends on their individual characteristics, the interaction they may have with an infected person and home confinement conditions, but not their experience with preventive measures. We find that behaviors such as sensitivity to certainty, selfishness and altruism emerge. As far as cost-effectiveness is concerned, our study shows that home confinement is a prevention path that should not be neglected and should even be prescribed.","Orset, Caroline",Eur J Health Econ,206,12

Case report and review of the current literature,20.251774,9.543742,2020-04-21,"BACKGROUND: Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is a parasitic zoonotic disease, endemic in the Mediterranean basin including Spain. While knowledge about CanL, its management, treatment, prevention and control mounts, it remains unclear whether all clinical veterinarians follow the same international recommendations, such as those of the LeishVet group. This study was thus designed to assess recent trends in the clinical management of CanL in veterinary clinics across Spain through a questionnaire-based survey. Results were compared with those of a prior national multicenter questionnaire administered by our research team in 2005. METHODS: A questionnaire consisting of 28 questions about CanL was developed using Google Forms and distributed by email to 1428 veterinary clinics in Spain. Questions were designed to obtain data on common clinical signs, techniques and complementary exams used to diagnose the disease, and on its monitoring, treatment and control measures. Data were collected in a database for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were returned by 295 clinics. Compared to the situation in 2005, responses indicate that clinical signs of CanL have not changed significantly, cutaneous lesions being still the most prevalent sign observed by practitioners. Quantitative serological techniques are considered an adequate approach to diagnosis, provided their results are supported by the findings of a thorough physical exam, as well as complementary tests (complete blood count, biochemical profile, plasma protein electrophoretogram and complete urinalysis). Treatment protocols and check-ups follow international recommendations. Finally, a multimodal approach is being endorsed to adequately control CanL including preventive measures such as annual serological check-ups and the combination of repellents and vaccines. Additionally, owners are being better informed about CanL by veterinarians, which translates to the improved control of this zoonosis. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical management of CanL has recently undergone significant changes owing to improvements in clinical knowledge of the disease, more unified international criteria, improved diagnostic techniques and their adequate interpretation, as well as a greater awareness of the disease transmitted to owners.

The present study reports the results of epidemiological investigation of possible outbreak of candidemia by C. krusei in paediatric unit at our tertiary care centre. METHODS: Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with C. krusei candidemia were evaluated. Yeast identification and antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to standard protocol. To find the potential source of C. krusei in hospital environment and hand colonization, swabs were collected from different fomites (n = 40) and hand washings from 24 health care workers (HCW), respectively. Infection control and prevention practices were intensified following the recognition of outbreak. Genetic typing was done by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) technique. Case–control comparison was performed with C. tropicalis and C. pelliculosa cases. RESULTS: Candida krusei fungaemia significantly affected paediatric group (82/186, 44%) as compared to adults (14/130, 10.8%; p < 0.001). Among paediatric group, maximum isolation was reported from neonatal unit of paediatric emergency (NUPE). C. krusei was isolated from hands of one HCW and washbasin in NUPE. FAFLP revealed clonality between blood and environmental isolates indicating cross-transmission of C. krusei. Gastrointestinal disease (p = 0.018), previous antibiotics (p = 0.021) especially to carbapenems (p = 0.039), was significant among C. krusei candidemia cases compared to C. pelliculosa cases. CONCLUSION: We report the largest outbreak of C. krusei candidemia in paediatric unit within 1 year with isolation of related strains from environment and hands of HCW. Routine screening of hand hygiene practices revealed non-compliance to standard practices leading to the increase in C. krusei candidemia cases.","Kaur, Harsimran; Shankarnarayana, Shamanth A.; Hallur, Vinaykumar; Muralidharan, Jayashree; Biswal, Manisha; Ghosh, Anup K.; Ray, Pallab; Chakrabarti, Arunaloke; Rudramurthy, Shivaprakash M.",Mycopathologia,206,12

The additions are in the form of a self-interaction and cross-interaction of the brain’s amygdala and prefrontal cortex. We show that the cross-interaction significantly determines the final decision of a player, whether it becomes a rational or an irrational choice. In contrast, the nonlinear self-interaction term provides a feedback mechanism that speeds up the corresponding decision-making process. We also suggest the form of expectation values of the overall reaction rate coefficients of those nonlinear terms by making an analogy with the original model formulation.","Muthoharoh, Luluk; Hardhienata, Hendradi; Alatas, Husin",J Biol Phys,206,1

However, it is difficult to directly dissect the TFs mediated genome-wide gene regulatory network (GRN) by experiment. Here, we proposed a hierarchical graphical model to estimate TF activity from mRNA expression by building TF complexes with protein cofactors and inferring TF’s downstream regulatory network simultaneously. Then we applied our model on flower development and circadian rhythm processes in Arabidopsis thaliana. The computational results show that the sequence specific bHLH family TF HFR1 recruits the chromatin regulator HAC1 to flower development master regulator TF AG and further activates AG’s expression by histone acetylation. Both independent data and experimental results supported this discovery. We also found a flower tissue specific H3K27ac ChIP-seq peak at AG gene body and a HFR1 motif in the center of this H3K27ac peak. Furthermore, we verified that HFR1 physically interacts with HAC1 by yeast two-hybrid experiment. This HFR1–HAC1–AG triplet relationship may imply that flower development and circadian rhythm are bridged by epigenetic regulation and enrich the classical ABC model in flower development. In addition, our TF activity network can serve as a general method to elucidate molecular mechanisms on other complex biological regulatory processes.","Duren, Zhana; Wang, Yaling; Wang, Jiguang; Zhao, Xing-Ming; Lv, Le; Li, Xiaobo; Liu, Jingdong; Zhu, Xin-Guang; Chen, Luonan; Wang, Yong",NPJ Syst Biol Appl,206,26

After down-selection, we solve cryo-EM structures that validate the binding of two small molecule hits in very similar manners to the predicted binding poses, including interactions with aromatic residues within the fusion peptide. One of the molecules demonstrates low micromolar inhibition of the autologous virus by using a very rare phenylalanine in the fusion peptide and stabilizing the surrounding region.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) has shown to be beneficial in patients in hemorrhagic shock, although widespread adoption might result in incorrect TXA administration leading to increased morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A 7-year prospective cohort study with consecutive trauma patients admitted to a Level-1 Trauma Center ICU was performed to investigate administration of both pre- and in-hospital TXA and its relation to morbidity and mortality. Indication for prehospital and in-hospital TXA administration was (suspicion of) hemorrhagic shock, and/or systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 90 mmHg. Demographics, data on physiology, resuscitation and outcomes were prospectively collected. RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-two patients (71% males, median ISS 29, 95% blunt injuries) were included. Even though TXA patients were more severely injured with more deranged physiology, no differences in outcome were noted. Overall, thrombo-embolic complication rate was 8%. In half the patients, hemorrhagic shock was the indication for prehospital TXA, whereas 79% of in-hospital TXA was given based on suspicion of hemorrhagic shock. Thirteen percent of patients with SBP ≤ 90 mmHg in ED received no TXA at all. Based on SBP alone, 22% of prehospital TXA and 25% of in-hospital TXA were justified. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being more severely injured, TXA patients had similar outcome compared to patients without TXA. Thrombo-embolic complication rate was low despite liberal use of both prehospital and in-hospital TXA. Caution should be exercised in selecting patients for TXA, although this might be challenging based on SBP alone in patients who do not yet show signs of deranged physiology on arrival in ED.

This activation produces cytokines such as interferons and pro-inflammatory factors via the downstream IRF3 and NF-κB pathways, triggering an innate immune response and adaptive immunity to maintain homeostasis. STING is mainly expressed and activated in non-parenchymal cells, thus exerting a corresponding effect to maintain the homeostasis of the liver. In viral hepatitis, interferons and pro-inflammatory factors produced after STING activation initiate the immune response to inhibit virus replication and assembly. In the case of metabolic diseases of the liver, the activation of STING in kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells leads to inflammation, the proliferation of connective tissue, and metabolic disorders in the hepatocytes, promoting the occurrence and development of the disease. In hepatocellular carcinoma, STING has two contradictory roles. When STING is activated in dendritic cells and macrophages, a large number of cytokines can be produced to initiate innate immune effects directly and to exert adaptive immunity through the recruitment and activation of T cells; however, aberrant activation of the STING pathway leads to a weakening of immune function and promotes oncogenesis and metastasis. Here, we summarize the interactions between STING and liver disease that have currently been identified and how to achieve therapeutic goals by modulating the activity of the STING pathway.","Chen, Can; Yang, Rui-Xia; Xu, Hua-Guo",J Gastroenterol,206,20

The use of intraoperative lung protective ventilation (LPV) strategies, usually including the use of a low V(t), low PEEP and low plateau pressure, seem to reduce the risk of PPC and are strongly recommended in almost all surgical procedures. Nonetheless, feasibility of LPV strategies in neurosurgical patients are still debated because the use of low Vt during LPV might result in hypercapnia with detrimental effects on cerebrovascular physiology. Aim of our study was to determine whether LPV strategies would be feasible compared with a control group in adult patients undergoing cranial or spinal surgery. METHODS: This single-centre, pilot randomized clinical trial was conducted at the University Hospital “Maggiore della Carità” (Novara, Italy). Adult patients undergoing major cerebral or spinal neurosurgical interventions with risk index for pulmonary post-operative complications > 2 and not expected to need post-operative intensive care unit (ICU) admission were considered eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to either LPV (Vt = 6 ml/kg of ideal body weight (IBW), respiratory rate initially set at 16 breaths/min, PEEP at 5 cmH2O and application of a recruitment manoeuvre (RM) immediately after intubation and at every disconnection from the ventilator) or control treatment (Vt = 10 ml/kg of IBW, respiratory rate initially set at 6–8 breaths/min, no PEEP and no RM). Primary outcomes of the study were intraoperative adverse events, the level of cerebral tension at dura opening and the intraoperative control of PaCO(2.) Secondary outcomes were the rate of pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications, the number of unplanned ICU admissions, ICU and hospital lengths of stay and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients, 30 for each group, were randomized. During brain surgery, the number of episodes of intraoperative hypercapnia and grade of cerebral tension were similar between patients randomized to receive control or LPV strategies. No difference in the rate of intraoperative adverse events was found between groups. The rate of postoperative pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications and major clinical outcomes were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: LPV strategies in patients undergoing major neurosurgical intervention are feasible. Larger clinical trials are needed to assess their role in postoperative clinical outcome improvements.

METHODS: Literature searches retrieved peer-reviewed publications and abstracts from major international infectious disease congresses from January 2015 to February 2021. Results were screened using pre-defined criteria to limit the dataset to relevant publications (notable exclusions were paediatric data and outcomes data for bacteria intrinsically resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam). Data for included publications were subjected to qualitative synthesis. RESULTS: Seventy-three relevant publications (62 peer-reviewed articles; 10 abstracts) comprising 1926 patients treated with ceftazidime-avibactam (either alone or combined with other antimicrobials) and 1114 comparator/control patients were identified. All patients were hospitalised for serious illness and most had multiple comorbidities. The most common infections were pneumonia, bacteraemia, and skin/soft tissue, urinary tract, or abdominal infections; smaller numbers of patients with meningitis, febrile neutropenia, osteomyelitis, and cystic fibrosis were also included. Carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CRE; n = 1718) and carbapenem-resistant, multidrug-resistant (MDR), and extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 150) were the most common pathogens. Most publications reported positive outcomes for ceftazidime-avibactam treatment (clinical success rates ranged from 45 to 100% and reported 30-day mortality from 0 to 63%), which were statistically superior versus comparators in some studies. ceftazidime-avibactam resistance emergence occurred infrequently and mostly in Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae strains. CONCLUSION: This review provides qualitative evidence of successful use of ceftazidime-avibactam for the treatment of hospitalised patients with CRE and MDR P. aeruginosa infections with limited treatment options.

We have previously shown that the formation of AC in murine CMV- (MCMV) infected cells begins in the early phase of infection (at 4–6 hpi) with the pre-AC establishment. Pre-AC comprises membranes derived from the endosomal recycling compartment, early endosomes, and the trans-Golgi network, which is surrounded by fragmented Golgi cisterns. To explore the importance of Arf GTPases in the biogenesis of the pre-AC, we infected Balb 3T3 cells with MCMV and analyzed the expression and intracellular localization of Arf proteins in the early phases (up to 16 hpi) of infection and the development of pre-AC in cells with a knockdown of Arf protein expression by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Herein, we show that even in the early phase, MCMVs cause massive reorganization of the Arf system of the host cells and induce the over-recruitment of Arf proteins onto the membranes of pre-AC. Knockdown of Arf1, Arf3, Arf4, or Arf6 impaired the establishment of pre-AC. However, the knockdown of Arf1 and Arf6 also abolished the establishment of infection. Our study demonstrates that Arf GTPases are required for different steps of early cytomegalovirus infection, including the establishment of the pre-AC.","Pavišić, Valentino; Mahmutefendić Lučin, Hana; Blagojević Zagorac, Gordana; Lučin, Pero",Life (Basel),206,8

Systematic studies illustrate the effects of (i) human activities (i.e., dam construction, groundwater extraction, water flow regulation and diversion, and land management) and (ii) natural factors (i.e., climate, soil characteristics, vegetation, and topography) on hydrological connectivity. Approaches (i.e., soil water content patterns, runoff patterns and processes, numerical models, and index of hydrological connectivity) applied to evaluate hydrological connectivity are examined in detail. Lastly, hydrological connectivity at multiscales is indicated. This review concludes with a discussion of potential research trends that can improve understanding of hydrological connectivity. Reported records showed that few studies were published on hydrological connectivity from 1980 to 2003, whereas the evolution of these studies is temporally promising since 2003. We cannot define a standard concept of hydrological connectivity that works in all environments. We desire to show different concepts of hydrological connectivity in different environments. The degree and nature of hydrological connectivity are not static due to the influences of human activities and changes of natural factors. The index of hydrological connectivity and numerical models are the most significant approaches to assess the changes in hydrological connectivity. This study showed that considering hydrological connectivity in social-economical-ecological-hydrological frameworks can prevent its negative effects on surface or subsurface water quantity and quality and is beneficial for sound water sources management.","Zhang, Yinghu; Huang, Chenyang; Zhang, Wenqi; Chen, Jinhong; Wang, Lu",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,206,1

Mutations in genes regulating RNA splicing are common in hematological malignancies leading to dysregulated splicing and intron retention (IR). In this study, we investigated IR as a potential source of tumor neoantigens in multiple myeloma (MM) patients and the relationship of IR-induced neoantigens (IR-neoAg) with clinical outcomes. MM-specific IR events were identified in RNA-sequencing data from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass study after removing IR events that also occurred in normal plasma cells. We quantified the IR-neoAg load by assessing IR-induced novel peptides that were predicted to bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. We found that high IR-neoAg load was associated with poor overall survival in both newly diagnosed and relapsed MM patients. Further analyses revealed that poor outcome in MM patients with high IR-neoAg load was associated with high expression levels of T-cell co-inhibitory molecules and elevated interferon signaling activity. We also found that MM cells exhibiting high IR levels had lower MHC-II protein abundance and treatment of MM cells with a spliceosome inhibitor resulted in increased MHC-I protein abundance. Our findings suggest that IR-neoAg may represent a novel biomarker of MM patient clinical outcome and further that targeting RNA splicing may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent MM immune escape and promote response to checkpoint blockade.","Dong, Chuanpeng; Cesarano, Annamaria; Bombaci, Giuseppe; Reiter, Jill L.; Yu, Christina Y.; Wang, Yue; Jiang, Zhaoyang; Zaid, Mohammad Abu; Huang, Kun; Lu, Xiongbin; Walker, Brian A.; Perna, Fabiana; Liu, Yunlong",Oncogene,206,31

The primary aim of our study was to assess the feasibility of the freehand placement, with intra-channel release, of the new EC-LAMS. The secondary aims were to assess technical and clinical outcomes and rates of adverse events. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 5 patients (3F; mean age: 75.6 ± 14.6 ys) who underwent new EC-LAMS placement for different indication (cholecystitis, malignant biliary obstruction and malignant gastric outlet obstruction). We described all the procedures of EC-LAMS placement, providing also an video of one of them (online supplementary material). RESULTS: Technical and clinical success was achieved in all patients who underwent new EC-LAMS placement, and no AEs were experienced. All of the EC-LAMS were placed using freehand technique with intra-channel release. CONCLUSIONS: Our initial experience with the new EC-LAMS showed a good performance of this device for different indications, especially if the stents are placed freehand and with intra-channel release. Further studies are needed to confirm our preliminary data and first impression about this new EC-LAMS.","Mangiavillano, Bendetto; Auriemma, Francesco; Lamonaca, Laura; Repici, Alessandro",Dig Dis,206,1

It is assumed that numerous risk factors, especially infectious ones, can have a detrimental effect on cervical cancer. In this study, we evaluated the expression of Herv-K env, np9, rec and gag in cervical tissues. After RNA extraction and cDNA sensitizing of 12 cervical cancer tissues and CIN3, 51 CIN1,2 and 18 normal ones, Herv-K env, np9, rec and gag were assessed using quantitative real-time PCR analysis. There was a decrease in the level of HERV-K env expression in cervical cancer and CIN 1-3 in compression with normal tissues. Cervical cancer and CIN3 indicated the most increase in expression. Meanwhile, we observed an increase in gag and rec expression in CIN 1,2; although cervical cancer and CIN 3 had a decrease in rec and gag expression, we did not report any changes in np expression. In conclusion, given the relationship between HERV-associated genes and cervical cancer, our study suggests that these genes can be useful for cancer diagnosis. However, further investigations are needed to provide a better perspective about the effectiveness of these genes in the diagnostic strategies of gastrointestinal cancer. These results are just an observation that could open a wider investigation to test the correlation between the expression of these genes and cervical cancer.","Tavakolian, S.; Goudarzi, H.; Moridi, A.; Faghihloo, E.",New Microbes New Infect,206,1

A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been shown to be the causative agent of SARS. The typical clinical feature associated with SARS is diffuse alveolar damage in lung, and lung fibrosis is evident in patients who died from this disease. The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV infection causes lung fibrosis are not fully understood, but transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated lung fibrosis are among the most documented ones. The activation of the TGF-β/Smad pathway is critical to lung fibrosis. SARS-CoV infection not only enhances the expression of TGF-β, but also facilitates its signaling activity. The SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 is a negative regulator of lung fibrosis, and SARS-CoV infection decreases ACE2 expression. Therefore, SARS-CoV infection may lead to lung fibrosis through multiple signaling pathways and TGF-β activation is one of the major contributors.","Zuo, Wei; Zhao, Xingang; Chen, Ye-Guang",Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus,206,1

One of common approaches is to identify minimal unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of the constraint set. The more MUSes are identified, the better insight is obtained. However, since there can be up to exponentially many MUSes, their complete enumeration might be intractable. Therefore, we focus on algorithms that enumerate MUSes online, i.e. one by one, and thus can find at least some MUSes even in the intractable cases. Since MUSes find applications in different constraint domains and new applications still arise, there have been proposed several domain agnostic algorithms. Such algorithms can be applied in any constraint domain and thus theoretically serve as ready-to-use solutions for all the emerging applications. However, there are almost no domain agnostic tools, i.e. tools that both implement domain agnostic algorithms and can be easily extended to support any constraint domain. In this work, we close this gap by introducing a domain agnostic tool called MUST. Our tool outperforms other existing domain agnostic tools and moreover, it is even competitive to fully domain specific solutions.","Bendík, Jaroslav; Černá, Ivana",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,206,1

The essay also argues that despite the undeniable difficulties such situations pose to human rights work, they also present a unique opportunity to—more effectively than before—re-explain and re-present human rights as a matter of importance to all members of society—majority and minority alike. The experience that in crisis situations belonging to the mainstream may not protect one from becoming vulnerable and exposed to abuses by those in power, may enable rule of law and human rights advocates to better convey the message that the accountability of the executive branch is crucial to a well-functioning democracy, while an illiberal regime does not provide sufficient protection against such instances of government overreach.","Kádár, András",J Hum Rights Pract,206,3

Comprehensive cross-sectional screening enables assessment of viral load independent of symptoms, informing transmission risks. We quantified SARS-CoV-2 burden by RT-qPCR from comprehensive screening of nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Massachusetts to inform our ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with or without symptoms. METHODS: From 4/9/20 to 6/9/20, we tested nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 32,480 unique individuals comprising staff and residents of the majority of nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Massachusetts. Symptomatology at the time of sampling and demographic information were provided by each facility. NP swabs were collected, RNA extracted, and SARS-CoV-2 testing performed by RT-qPCR. We compared cycle thresholds (Ct) with a standard curve to quantify viral loads. RESULTS: The nursing home and assisted living facilities resident cohort (N = 16,966) was 65% female with mean age 82. The staff cohort (N = 15,514) was 76% female with mean age 45. In all, 2654 residents (15.5%) and 624 staff (4.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, including 12.7% of residents and 3.7% of staff without symptoms, compared to 53.1% of residents and 18.2% of staff with symptoms. The Ct distributions for viral probes were very similar between populations with and without symptoms (Fig 1), with a statistically but not meaningfully different mean (ΔCt 0.71 cycles, p = 0.006) and a similar range (12–38 cycles). This similarity persisted across all sub-categories examined (age, race, ethnicity, sex, resident/staff).

The size of the study population, including both staff and residents spanning a wide range of ages, provides a comprehensive cross-sectional point prevalence measurement of viral burden. Because the distributions of viral loads are very similar regardless of symptoms, existing testing modalities validated for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in symptomatic patients should perform similarly well in individuals without symptoms at the time of testing.

Previous reports have identified risk factors using statistical inference model. The primary goal of these models is to characterize the relationship between variables and outcomes, not to make predictions. In contrast, the primary purpose of machine learning is obtaining a model that can make repeatable predictions. The objective of this study is to develop decision rules tailored to our patient population to predict ICU admissions and death in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We used a de-identified dataset of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 admitted to our community hospital between March 2020 and June 2020. We used a Random Forest algorithm to build the prediction models for ICU admissions and death. Random Forest is one of the most powerful machine learning algorithms; it leverages the power of multiple decision trees, randomly created, for making decisions. RESULTS: 313 patients were included; 237 patients were used to train each model, 26 were used for testing, and 50 for validation. A total of 16 variables, selected according to their availability in the Emergency Department, were fit into the models. For the survival model, the combination of age >57 years, the presence of altered mental status, procalcitonin ≥3.0 ng/mL, a respiratory rate >22, and a blood urea nitrogen >32 mg/dL resulted in a decision rule with an accuracy of 98.7% in the training model, 73.1% in the testing model, and 70% in the validation model (Table 1, Figure 1). For the ICU admission model, the combination of age < 82 years, a systolic blood pressure of ≤94 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of ≤93%, a lactate dehydrogenase >591 IU/L, and a lactic acid >1.5 mmol/L resulted in a decision rule with an accuracy of 99.6% in the training model, 80.8% in the testing model, and 82% in the validation model (Table 2, Figure 2). Table 1. Measures of Performance in Predicting Inpatient Mortality [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: We created decision rules using machine learning to predict ICU admission or death in patients with COVID-19. Although there are variables previously described with statistical inference, these decision rules are customized to our patient population; furthermore, we can continue to train the models fitting more data with new patients to create even more accurate prediction rules.

Should negative differentials be grounds for sleeping more soundly, despite high government debts? We analyze interest-growth differentials using data on average effective borrowing costs for 55 countries over up to 200 years. Negative differentials prevail for both advanced and emerging economies. Even so, several default episodes have followed periods of negative differentials, and differentials are no higher prior to defaults than in normal times. Marginal (rather than average) government borrowing costs often rise sharply, but just preceding default. Based on these results, our answer is: not really.","Mauro, Paolo; Zhou, Jing",IMF Econ Rev,206,1

Viruses invade host cells and associate with host molecules, potentially disrupting the normal function of hosts that leads to fatal diseases. Novel viral genome prediction is crucial for understanding the complex viral diseases like AIDS and Ebola. While most existing computational techniques classify viral genomes, the efficiency of the classification depends solely on the structural features extracted. The state-of-the-art DNN models achieved excellent performance by automatic extraction of classification features, but the degree of model explainability is relatively poor. During model training for viral prediction, proposed CNN, CNN-LSTM based methods (EdeepVPP, EdeepVPP-hybrid) automatically extracts features. EdeepVPP also performs model interpretability in order to extract the most important patterns that cause viral genomes through learned filters. It is an interpretable CNN model that extracts vital biologically relevant patterns (features) from feature maps of viral sequences. The EdeepVPP-hybrid predictor outperforms all the existing methods by achieving 0.992 mean AUC-ROC and 0.990 AUC-PR on 19 human metagenomic contig experiment datasets using 10-fold cross-validation. We evaluate the ability of CNN filters to detect patterns across high average activation values. To further asses the robustness of EdeepVPP model, we perform leave-one-experiment-out cross-validation. It can work as a recommendation system to further analyze the raw sequences labeled as ‘unknown’ by alignment-based methods. We show that our interpretable model can extract patterns that are considered to be the most important features for predicting virus sequences through learned filters.","Dasari, Chandra Mohan; Bhukya, Raju",Appl Intell,206,16

Through the use of DFS, vulnerable and marginalized groups can reduce the risk and cost of using cash, and increase their access to a suite of financial services that would have been otherwise unavailable, or difficult to obtain, such as credit, savings, insurance, and pension. This paper provides an overview of the policy environment regulating digital finance in India as well as presents high-level statistics on the level of digitization across population segments in the country. It then moves on to describe the digital readiness, current usage of digital financial services, and specific issues and solutions for three vulnerable and marginalized groups with high digitization potential: women, micro-entrepreneurs, and domestic migrants. This is complemented by insights drawn from LEAD at Krea University’s primary research on these topics. Finally, the paper provides recommendations to accelerate the penetration of digital financial services among vulnerable groups. These include monitoring the implementation of recently introduced policies on data privacy, grievance redressal, and KYC simplification. It is also recommended to develop customized digital financial services that address the unique needs and profiles of vulnerable groups, such as those specifically analysed in this paper.","Buteau, Sharon; Rao, Preethi; Valenti, Fabrizio",CSIT,206,5

As antibiotic concentrations at the site of infection are responsible for killing, we investigated the activity of human-simulated epithelial lining fluid (ELF) exposures of three antibiotics (ceftaroline, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin) commonly used for treatment of S. aureus pneumonia. An in vitro pharmacodynamic model was used to simulate ELF exposures of vancomycin (1 g every 12 h [q12h]), ceftaroline (600 mg q12h and q8h), and ceftriaxone (2 g q24h and q12h). Four S. aureus isolates (2 MSSA and 2 MRSA) were evaluated over 72 h with a starting inoculum of ∼ 10(6) CFU/ml. Time-kill curves were constructed, and microbiological response (change in log10 CFU/ml from 0 h and the area under the bacterial killing and regrowth curve [AUBC]) was assessed in duplicate. The change in 72-h log10 CFU/ml was largest for ceftaroline q8h (reductions of >3 log10 CFU/ml against all strains). This regimen also achieved the lowest AUBC against all organisms (P < 0.05). Vancomycin produced reliable bacterial reductions of 0.9 to 3.3 log10 CFU/ml, while the activity of ceftaroline q12h was more variable (reductions of 0.2 to 2.3 log10 CFU/ml against 3 of 4 strains). Both regimens of ceftriaxone were poorly active against MSSA tested (0.1 reduction to a 1.8-log10 CFU/ml increase). Against these S. aureus isolates, ELF exposures of ceftaroline 600 mg q8h exhibited improved antibacterial activity compared with ceftaroline 600 mg q12h and vancomycin, and therefore, this q8h regimen deserves further evaluation for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia. These data also suggest that ceftriaxone should be avoided for S. aureus pneumonia.","MacVane, Shawn H; So, Wonhee; Nicolau, David P; Kuti, Joseph L",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,206,1

Photoplethysmography constitutes the optical signal in pulse oximetry. STUDY DESIGN Stroke volume was determined echocardiographically. Pulse transit time, right hand to foot arrival time difference, and relative amplitude were measured from pulse oximeter and ECG waveforms. Photoplethysmographic parameters before and after PDA closure were compared with stroke volume. RESULTS After PDA closure, pulse transit time to the hand and to the foot were prolonged (54.7 ± 6.7 vs 65.5 ± 9.8 ms, p < 0.001, 82.5 ± 12.8 vs 88.6 ± 10.6 ms, p = 0.03), arrival time difference decreased (27.7 ± 7.6 vs 23.1 ± 5.6 ms, p = 0.021), and relative amplitude decreased (from 2.1 ± 0.7% to 1.5 ± 0.5%, p = 0.003). The time-based photoplethysmographic parameters correlated with stroke volume. CONCLUSIONS Photoplethysmographic waveform parameters are significantly different before and after PDA closure and the time-based parameters correlate well with stroke volume. Monitoring pulse transit time may assist in evaluation for spontaneous PDA closure or response to therapy.","Amirtharaj, Cynthia R; Palmeri, Lynn C; Gradwohl, Gideon; Adar, Yair; Nitzan, Meir; Gruber, Dorota; Blaufox, Andrew; Meyer, David B; Kwon, Elena N; Koppel, Robert",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,206,16

DESIGN We used 2 discrete-event simulation models: the first model simulates the contact and disease transmission process, as affected by public health interventions, to produce a stream of arriving patients, and the second model simulates the diagnosis and treatment process and determines patient outcomes. SETTING Hypothetical scenarios were based on the response plans, infrastructure, and demographic data of the population of San Antonio, Texas. RESULTS Use of a mix of strategies, including social distancing, antiviral medications, and targeted vaccination, may limit the overall attack rate so that demand for care would not exceed the capacity of the infrastructure. Additional simulations to assess social distancing as a sole mitigation strategy suggest that a reduction of infectious community contacts to half of normal levels would have to occur within approximately 7 days. CONCLUSIONS Under ideal conditions, the mix of strategies may limit demand, which can then be met by community surge capacity. Given inadequate supplies of vaccines and antiviral medications, aggressive social distancing alone might allow for the control of a local epidemic without reliance on outside support.","Miller, George; Randolph, Stephen; Patterson, Jan E",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,206,1

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of diisocyanate cross-linked acellular porcine dermal collagen mesh for parastomal hernia repair, with particular reference to the relationship of the stoma site to the rectus sheath. METHODS Hernias were repaired via a lateral approach, with onlay placement of the biologic mesh. A retrospective case note review and analysis of clinical outcomes was performed. The relationship of the stoma to the rectus sheath was determined by abdominal computed tomography (CT) and intraoperative findings. RESULTS Over a 16-month period, 27 consecutive patients, median age 72 years, underwent parastomal hernia repair utilising onlay biologic mesh to reinforce the external oblique aponeurosis. There were 20 paracolostomy and seven paraileostomy hernias. Eleven stomas passed through the rectus sheath and 16 were lateral to it. Recurrences occurred in 3 of 11 stomas within and 12 of 16 stomas lateral to the rectus sheath (P = 0.022). The median time to recurrence was 10.1 months. The median follow up of patients without recurrence was 16.6 months (range 0.2-39.3). There was one perioperative death. One patient developed a superficial post-operative abscess that was managed conservatively, but there were no complications related to the biologic mesh and no mesh required removal. CONCLUSIONS For parastomal hernias within the rectus sheath, diisocyanate cross-linked porcine dermal collagen mesh onlay repair gives good results and is safe to use. Repair of a parastomal hernia where the stoma is lateral to the rectus sheath has a significantly higher risk of recurrence and is not recommended.","Smart, N J; Velineni, R; Khan, D; Daniels, I R",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,206,1

We determined the extent of do-not-resuscitate reversals between hospitalizations and the association of the readmission hospital with do-not-resuscitate reversal. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING California Patient Discharge Database, 2016-2018. PATIENTS Nonsurgical patients admitted to an acute care hospital with an early do-not-resuscitate order (within 24 hr of admission). INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We identified nonsurgical adult patients who survived an initial hospitalization with an early-do-not-resuscitate order and were readmitted within 30 days. The primary outcome was the association of do-not-resuscitate reversal with readmission to the same or different hospital from the initial hospital. Secondary outcomes included association of readmission to a low versus high do-not-resuscitate-rate hospital with do-not-resuscitate reversal. Among 49,336 patients readmitted within 30 days following a first do-not-resuscitate hospitalization, 22,251 (45.1%) experienced do-not-resuscitate reversal upon readmission. Patients readmitted to a different hospital versus the same hospital were at higher risk of do-not-resuscitate reversal (59.5% vs 38.5%; p < 0.001; adjusted odds ratio = 2.4; 95% CI, 2.3-2.5). Patients readmitted to low versus high do-not-resuscitate-rate hospitals were more likely to have do-not-resuscitate reversals (do-not-resuscitate-rate quartile 1 77.0% vs quartile 4 27.2%; p < 0.001; adjusted odds ratio = 11.9; 95% CI, 10.7-13.2). When readmitted to a different versus the same hospital, patients with do-not-resuscitate reversal had higher rates of mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.6-2.1) and hospital death (adjusted odds ratio = 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3). CONCLUSIONS Do-not-resuscitate reversals at the time of readmission are more common than previously reported. Although changes in patient preferences may partially explain between-hospital differences, we observed a strong hospital effect contributing to high do-not-resuscitate-reversal rates with significant implications for patient outcomes and resource.","Mehta, Anuj B; Walkey, Allan J; Curran-Everett, Douglas; Matlock, Daniel; Douglas, Ivor S",Critical care medicine,206,28

Patients' medical history, procedural and clinical follow-up data, including complications and estimated survival, were reviewed. Additionally, a sub analysis of the patients with widespread ovarian cancer and refractory ascites treated with or without intraperitoneal administration of cytotoxic drugs was made. RESULTS In all 94 patients it was technically feasible to insert the peritoneal drainage catheter and to drain a median of 3260 cc (range 100 cc - 8500 cc) of malignant ascitic fluid. Post procedural complications included catheter infection (n = 2; 2%), fluid leakage around the entry site (n = 4; 4%), catheter occlusion (n = 2; 2%), sleeve formation around the catheter tip (n = 1; 1%) and accidental loss of the catheter (n = 1; 1%).

DESIGN Consensus conference of experts in pediatric acute lung injury. METHODS A panel of 27 experts met over the course of 2 years to develop a taxonomy to define pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and to make recommendations regarding treatment and research priorities. The nonpulmonary subgroup comprised three experts. When published data were lacking, a modified Delphi approach emphasizing strong professional agreement was utilized. RESULTS The Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference experts developed and voted on a total of 151 recommendations addressing the topics related to pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome, 30 of which related to nonpulmonary treatment. All 30 recommendations had strong agreement. Patients with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome should receive 1) minimal yet effective targeted sedation to facilitate mechanical ventilation; 2) neuromuscular blockade, if sedation alone is inadequate to achieve effective mechanical ventilation; 3) a nutrition plan to facilitate their recovery, maintain their growth, and meet their metabolic needs; 4) goal-directed fluid management to maintain adequate intravascular volume, end-organ perfusion, and optimal delivery of oxygen; and 5) goal-directed RBC transfusion to maintain adequate oxygen delivery. Future clinical trials in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome should report sedation, neuromuscular blockade, nutrition, fluid management, and transfusion exposures to allow comparison across studies. CONCLUSIONS The Consensus Conference developed pediatric-specific definitions for pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and recommendations regarding treatment and future research priorities.

However, it is unknown whether SMGGT is effective against human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). AIM OF THE STUDY HRSV is a major pediatric viral pathogen of low respiratory tract infection without effective management. This study tested the hypothesis that SMGGT effectively inhibited cytopathy induced by HRSV. MATERIALS AND METHODS Effect of the crude extract of SMGGT on HRSV was tested by plaque reduction assay in both human upper (HEp-2) and low (A549) respiratory tract cell lines. Ability of SMGGT to stimulate anti-viral cytokines was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS Crude extract of SMGGT dose-dependently inhibited HRSV-induced plaque formation. The crude extract was more effective when given before viral infection (p<0.0001). It inhibited viral attachment dose-dependently (p<0.0001) and could increase heparin effect on viral attachment. Furthermore, it was synergistic with very low-dose heparin on viral attachment. In addition, the crude extract time-dependently and dose-dependently (p<0.0001) inhibited HRSV internalization into HEp-2 cells. Epithelial cells secrete IFN-β and TNF-α to counteract viral infection. The crude extract could stimulate epithelial cells to secrete these cytokines beforehand and become resistant to viral infection. It also stimulated IFN-β to defense HRSV after viral inoculation.

To achieve this aim, extensive monitoring efforts beyond traditional disparities research are required. This analysis assesses trends in health equity for children from 1997 to 2018. METHODS Health equity in a given year is calculated using a previously developed measure as the mean weighted departure of individual health from the best achievable level of health. This criterion is defined as the median health of the most socially privileged identifiable group: white, non-Latinx boys in upper-income households. Using more than 20 years of data from the National Health Interview Survey, we apply this methodology to six measures of child health: parent-reported health status, school days missed due to illness or injury in the past year, a strength and difficulties questionnaire score, emotional difficulties, a toddler mental health indicator score, and toddler depression. We separately calculate racial/ethnic and income disparities. Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess whether trends are statistically significant. RESULTS Health equity among children increased gradually over the past 2 decades, with five of the six measures demonstrating upward trends. Improvements in health equity are stronger among younger children (age 0-3 and 4-7). Unlike previous work examining adults, both types of disparities narrowed over the study period. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE Progress on health equity requires accountability to an objective metric. This analysis suggests some improvement over the past two decades, although these gains are under threat from potential decreases in government spending on programs affecting children and the COVID-19 pandemic.","Anderson, Nathaniel W; Zimmerman, Frederick J",Maternal and child health journal,206,24

METHODS A lung model was used to simulate representative compliance (mL/cmH2O): resistance (cmH2O/L/s) combinations, 45:5 for N and BI, 60:7.7 for COPD, 15:7.7 and 35:7.7 for ARDS. Two levels of PEEP (cmH2O) were used for each scenario, 12/16 for ARDS, and 5/10 for others. The CO2 productions of 2, 3, 4 and 5 mL/kg predicted body weight/min were simulated. Tidal volume was set to 6 mL/kg during VC and PC. Outcomes of interest were end tidal CO2 (etCO2) and plateau pressure (P Plat). RESULTS EtCO2 levels in N and BI and COPD were similar for all modes. In ARDS, etCO2 was higher in ASVCO2 than in other modes (p < 0.001). Under all mechanical conditions ASVCO2 revealed a narrower range of etCO2. P Plat was similar for all modes in all scenarios but ARDS where P Plat in ASV and ASVCO2 were lower than in VC (p = 0.001). When P Plat was ≥ 28 cmH2O, P plat in ASV and ASVCO2 were lower than in VC and PC (p = 0.024). CONCLUSION All modes performed similarly in most cases. Minor differences observed were in favor of the closed loop modes. Overall, ASVCO2 maintained tighter CO2 control. The ASVCO2 had the greatest impact during ARDS allowing etCO2 to increase and protecting against hypocapnia evident with other modes while ensuring lower P plat and tidal volumes.","Sulemanji, Demet S; Marchese, Andrew; Wysocki, Marc; Kacmarek, Robert M",Intensive care medicine,206,6

Previous systematic reviews have demonstrated oncological safety of TM, but poor and inconsistent reporting of quality-of-life, aesthetic and functional outcomes, often with non-validated measurement tools. Moreover, there is a paucity of patient-reported outcome measures. Standardisation of outcome reporting is required to enable study results to be compared and combined, for example, through core outcome set (COS) development. This systematic review aims to comprehensively describe the outcomes reported in clinical studies of TM, their respective outcome measures and the time points at which they were evaluated. The overall objective is to facilitate the development of a COS for TM. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review of clinical studies evaluating outcomes following TM will be completed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The following electronic databases have been searched from inception to 5 August 2020: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science. Primary outcomes will include the number of reported outcomes of various types (clinical, aesthetic, functional, quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness), whether these are patient-reported or clinician-reported, how outcomes are defined and the outcome measurement tool(s) used.

This review summarizes the recent contributions to the literature on the treatment of eating disorders, including dialectical behavior therapy, yoga for positive embodiment, and treatment innovations in children and adolescents with eating disorders. Dialectical behavior therapy can be effectively used in complex eating disorder presentations, such as with comorbid substance use disorder and with suicidal behavior, and can be adapted for culturally-responsive treatments for binge eating and for guided self-help. Yoga may promote positive embodiment, which is supported by conceptual frameworks, studies evaluating yoga treatment interventions, and systematic reviews. Advances in eating disorder treatment for children and youth include the development of the Emotional Eating Scale adapted for children and adolescents, a review of primary care interventions for eating disorder treatment, and siblings' perspectives on eating disorder treatment. Research on novel methods including telementoring and innovative treatment modalities invoking feminism are promising areas of future research.","Nagata, Jason M; Murray, Stuart B",Eating disorders,206,17

This study evaluated functional outcomes of thrombectomy in patients with and without aSICH. METHODS Patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation who were treated with thrombectomy were enrolled in 21 centers. According to CT scans performed within 72 hours of endovascular procedures, patients with aSICH or without intracranial hemorrhage were included while patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) were excluded. Baseline data and functional outcomes were compared between patients with aSICH and those without intracranial hemorrhage. Logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the impacts of aSICH on functional outcomes. RESULTS Of the 632 patients with endovascular treatment, 101 (16.0%) were classified as having SICH, 212 (33.5%) as having aSICH, and 319 (50.5%) as being without intracranial hemorrhage. Patients with aSICH after endovascular treatment had a lower ratio of excellent outcome (mRS 0-1, OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.84, P=0.007) than those without intracranial hemorrhage. There were no significant differences concerning favorable outcome (mRS 0-2, OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14, P=0.185) or mortality (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.09, P=0.101) between patients with aSICH and those without intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS In an Asian population, aSICH after thrombectomy may decrease the likelihood of an excellent functional outcome but does not influence a favorable outcome and mortality in patients with ischemic stroke due to large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation.","Hao, Yonggang; Liu, Wenhua; Wang, Huaiming; Zi, Wenjie; Yang, Dong; Wang, Wei; Tian, Xiguang; Guo, Fuqiang; Jin, Ping; Xiong, Yunyun; Liu, Xinfeng; Xu, Gelin",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,206,1

To determine areas of concern, and challenges to implementing and assessing the co-curriculum in accredited Doctor of Pharmacy programs, along with how confident programs are in their ability to meet the co-curriculum requirement as mandated by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE).Methods. A survey was administered to all ACPE-accredited pharmacy programs to collect information regarding areas of concern, challenges, and confidence in their ability to meet the co-curriculum requirement. The frequency of responses to items are presented along with comparisons based on characteristics, including institution type, cohort size, most recent ACPE accreditation review, and supporting offices.Results. The most common concerns centered on the documentation and assessment process. The most commonly reported challenges were lack of enthusiasm or buy-in from faculty, staff, and students; lack of a clear definition of co-curriculum; and faculty time and insufficient staff. Overall, programs had a high level of confidence in their ability to meet the requirements for co-curriculum. The only differences found were related to supporting offices and cohort size.Conclusion. The results suggest that having supporting offices may reduce the co-curriculum burden. Similarly, student cohort size may have an impact on the challenges for some programs, particularly those with moderate-sized cohorts reporting challenges related to faculty and staff. Further research is needed to determine how programs address these critical issues, and to explore whether programs report differently on these areas after completing an accreditation review. The study results may be useful to members of the Academy when evaluating co-curriculum.","Maerten-Rivera, Jaime L; Chen, Aleda M H; Augustine, Jill; d'Assalenaux, Richard; Lindsey, Cameron C; Malcom, Daniel R; Mauro, Laurie S; Pavuluri, Nina; Rudolph, Michael J; Wong, Siu Fun; Zeeman, Jacqueline M; Zeszotarski, Paula",American journal of pharmaceutical education,206,1

DESIGN We explored numerous psychopathology, sociodemographic, and virus exposure-related variables associated with anxiety and perceived threat of death regarding COVID-19. METHOD We recruited 908 adults from Eastern China for a cross-sectional web survey, from 24 February to 15 March 2020, when social distancing was heavily enforced in China. We used several machine learning algorithms to train our statistical model of predictor variables in modeling COVID-19-related anxiety, and perceived threat of death, separately. We trained the model using many simulated replications on a random subset of participants, and subsequently externally tested on the remaining subset of participants. RESULTS Shrinkage machine learning algorithms performed best, indicating that stress and rumination were the most important variables in modeling COVID-19-related anxiety severity. Health anxiety was the most potent predictor of perceived threat of death from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Results are discussed in the context of research on anxiety and fear from prior virus outbreaks, and from theory on outbreak-related emotional vulnerability.

We sought to compare 2 different methods of measurements on computed tomography (CT) slices and to evaluate the accommodation and conformability, before and after ballooning, of the components used in the Octopus technique. METHODS The CT gutter analysis between the 3 stent grafts within the short docking limb of the Excluder(®) was made using Viabahns(®) of 8, 7, and 6 mm in diameter. Each of the 10 possible combinations underwent a CT established protocol. The best axial image of the docking limb was submitted for an evaluation by 2 independent analysts, using 2 different methods. We also performed a postballooning evaluation, and the same CT protocol was used. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the formats of measurement type ""A"" and type ""B."" Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the measurements made by the independent analysts. The tomography analyses demonstrated that the combination of stent grafts (Viabahn) of 8 and 7 mm diameter, inside the short docking limb of the bifurcated endoprosthesis, had the best possible relationship between the diameters used. These combinations showed better conformability and juxtaposition, with smaller areas of gutters and theoretically less possibility of endoleak. In addition, we found that postimplant balloon dilatation impaired the conformability and juxtaposition of the stent grafts (Viabahn) in the optimum combinations. CONCLUSIONS In this analysis, we demonstrated a feasible, reliable, and reproducible form of CT measurement of the gutters in the Octopus technique for endovascular repair of TAAAs. Based on these measurements, there is a preferable combination of Viabahn sizes to be used in the Octopus technique and that postdilatation impairs the conformability and juxtaposition.","Franklin, Rafael Narciso; Silveira, Pierre Galvagni; Timi, Jorge Rufino Ribas; Lee, Jason T; Galego, Gilberto do Nascimento; Bortoluzzi, Cristiano Torres",Annals of vascular surgery,206,24

This protocol for a systematic review proposes to investigate whether insomnia and/or sleep disturbances predict child and youth depression in community and clinical-based samples. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The protocol adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines. English-written, longitudinal studies that quantitatively estimated the prediction of depression by insomnia and/or sleep disturbances in individuals 5-24 years of age will be included. EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Scopus and Web of Science and grey literature will be searched from 1980 to the present. For the selection of studies, two reviewers will be involved. Data extraction will be conducted by one author and checked independently by a second author. Risk of bias will be appraised using the Research Triangle Institute Item Bank tool. Heterogeneity will be measured using the I2 statistics. Meta-analysis will be carried out if ≥3 results are available and if outcome measures can be pooled. The choice between a random-effect or fixed-effect model will be based both on the I2 statistics and the participant and study characteristics of the combined studies. Results of the meta-analyses will be summarised by a forest plot.

Although the demand for total joint arthroplasty is increasing, the burden of such infections is increasing even more rapidly, and they pose a unique challenge because their accurate diagnosis and eradication can prove elusive. This review describes the current knowledge regarding diagnosis and treatment of periprosthetic joint infection. A number of tools are available to aid in establishing a diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection. These include the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum C-reactive protein concentration, synovial white blood-cell count and differential, imaging studies, tissue specimen culturing, and histological analysis. Multiple definitions of periprosthetic joint infection have been proposed but there is no consensus. Tools under investigation to diagnose such infections include the C-reactive protein concentration in the joint fluid, point-of-care strip tests for the leukocyte esterase concentration in the joint fluid, and other molecular markers of periprosthetic joint infection. Treatment options include irrigation and debridement with prosthesis retention, one-stage prosthesis exchange, two-stage prosthesis exchange with intervening placement of an antibiotic-loaded spacer, and salvage treatments such as joint arthrodesis and amputation. Treatment selection is dependent on multiple factors including the timing of the symptom onset, patient health, the infecting organism, and a history of infection in the joint. Although prosthesis retention has the theoretical advantages of decreased morbidity and improved return to function, two-stage exchange provides a lower rate of recurrent infection. As the burden of periprosthetic joint infection increases, the orthopaedic and medical community should become more familiar with the disease. It is hoped that the tools currently under investigation will aid clinicians in diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection in an accurate and timely fashion to allow appropriate treatment. Given the current knowledge and planned future research, the medical community should be prepared to effectively manage this increasingly prevalent disease.","Parvizi, Javad; Adeli, Bahar; Zmistowski, Benjamin; Restrepo, Camilo; Greenwald, Alan Seth",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Although 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-induced tumor fluorescence is a strategy that can improve EOR in gliomas, only glioblastomas routinely fluoresce following 5-ALA administration. Intraoperative confocal microscopy adapts conventional confocal technology to a handheld probe that provides real-time fluorescent imaging at up to 1000× magnification. The authors report a combined approach in which intraoperative confocal microscopy is used to visualize 5-ALA tumor fluorescence in LGGs during the course of microsurgical resection. METHODS Following 5-ALA administration, patients with newly diagnosed LGG underwent microsurgical resection. Intraoperative confocal microscopy was conducted at the following points: 1) initial encounter with the tumor; 2) the midpoint of tumor resection; and 3) the presumed brain-tumor interface. Histopathological analysis of these sites correlated tumor infiltration with intraoperative cellular tumor fluorescence. RESULTS Ten consecutive patients with WHO Grades I and II gliomas underwent microsurgical resection with 5-ALA and intraoperative confocal microscopy. Macroscopic tumor fluorescence was not evident in any patient. However, in each case, intraoperative confocal microscopy identified tumor fluorescence at a cellular level, a finding that corresponded to tumor infiltration on matched histological analyses. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative confocal microscopy can visualize cellular 5-ALA-induced tumor fluorescence within LGGs and at the brain-tumor interface. To assess the clinical value of 5-ALA for high-grade gliomas in conjunction with neuronavigation, and for LGGs in combination with intraoperative confocal microscopy and neuronavigation, a Phase IIIa randomized placebo-controlled trial (BALANCE) is underway at the authors' institution.","Sanai, Nader; Snyder, Laura A; Honea, Norissa J; Coons, Stephen W; Eschbacher, Jennifer M; Smith, Kris A; Spetzler, Robert F",Journal of neurosurgery,206,16

While the paternal genome undergoes widespread DNAme loss before the first S-phase following fertilization, recent mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the zygotic paternal genome is paradoxically also subject to a low level of de novo DNAme. However, the loci involved, and impact on transcription were not addressed. Here, we employ allele-specific analysis of whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data and show that a number of genomic regions, including several dozen CGI promoters, are de novo methylated on the paternal genome by the 2-cell stage. A subset of these promoters maintains DNAme through development to the blastocyst stage. Consistent with paternal DNAme acquisition, many of these loci are hypermethylated in androgenetic blastocysts but hypomethylated in parthenogenetic blastocysts. Paternal DNAme acquisition is lost following maternal deletion of Dnmt3a, with a subset of promoters, which are normally transcribed from the paternal allele in blastocysts, being prematurely transcribed at the 4-cell stage in maternal Dnmt3a knockout embryos. These observations uncover a role for maternal DNMT3A activity in post-fertilization epigenetic reprogramming and transcriptional silencing of the paternal genome.","Richard Albert, Julien; Au Yeung, Wan Kin; Toriyama, Keisuke; Kobayashi, Hisato; Hirasawa, Ryutaro; Brind'Amour, Julie; Bogutz, Aaron; Sasaki, Hiroyuki; Lorincz, Matthew",Nature communications,206,1

RESULTS Major complications were seroma induction (3 mesh types), implant extrusion (1 mesh type), severe inflammatory and immune responses (non-crosslinked mesh), fibrosis and mineralisation (3 mesh types). After inflammation resolution, 3 of the matrices tested supported hernia healing but with marked tissue and temporal differences. AlloDerm(®*) and Surgisis Gold™ showed tissue reactivity with the host and a rapid rate of matrix remodelling.

METHODS A longitudinal study of 20 consecutive critically ill, delirious COVID-19 inpatients, assessed with the Charlson Comorbidity Index-Short Form (CCI-SF), COVID-19 Clinical Severity Scale (CCSS), Delirium Etiology Checklist, Delirium Motor Subtype Scale-4, and Delirium Diagnostic Tool-Provisional (DDT-Pro), was conducted. Correlational analysis of delirium severity (DDT-Pro) with each measure of clinical severity (CCI-SF and CCSS) and comparison of baseline DDT-Pro scores between patients who were living and those who were deceased at follow-up were conducted. RESULTS Participants were 50-90 years old (male, 75%; hypertension, 60%). The prevalence of preexisting medical comorbidities (CCI-SF) was low and not correlated with delirium severity (p=0.193). Eighteen patients were on mechanical or high-flow noninvasive ventilation at baseline in the intensive care unit (ICU; CCSS scores 2-4). Delirium severity (DDT-Pro scores 0-6) correlated with COVID-19 severity (0.459, p=0.021). Delirium motor subtype was hyperactive in 75% of patients. There were three to four etiologies for delirium in each patient, most commonly organ insufficiency (100%), systemic infection (100%), and metabolic and endocrine disturbances (95%). The baseline DDT-Pro score was ≤4 for five (25%) patients who died before the final assessment, with a trend of being lower than that for survivors (χ2=3.398, p=0.065). CONCLUSIONS Among inpatients with COVID-19, at least three different etiological categories were identified for delirium. ICU staff treating patients with severe cases of COVID-19 should anticipate a greater severity of delirium. Although multivariate analyses with larger study samples are needed, more severe delirium may herald greater risk of death among COVID-19 patients.","Velásquez-Tirado, Juan D; Trzepacz, Paula T; Franco, José G",The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences,206,7

We developed a porcine model of combined thermal injury/TBI and compared an ""aggressive"" fluid resuscitation strategy using the Parkland formula and a ""restrictive"" resuscitation strategy using the modified Brooke formula. METHODS Twenty eight swine were deeply anesthetized and received a 40% total body surface area full thickness burn injury and TBI. Swine were then randomized to receive restrictive or aggressive resuscitation for eight hours after which time animals were euthanized and necropsy was performed. Volume of brain injury was assessed after analyzing segmental slices of brain tissue. RESULTS There were no differences between the restrictive and aggressive resuscitation groups in blood pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, intra-cranial pressure (ICP), or serum lactate levels after 8 hours of resuscitation. Urine output was higher in the aggressive resuscitation group. The restrictive group had a significantly higher serum BUN compared to baseline and compared to the aggressive group. There was no significant difference in size of brain injury between groups. CONCLUSIONS Both restrictive and aggressive resuscitation demonstrated adequate resuscitation at eight hours post-injury. Increased serum BUN in the restrictive group may be an indicator of early acute kidney injury, despite adequate urine output. Resuscitation strategy did not appear to affect ICP or the size of brain injury.","Guenther, Timothy M; Spruce, Marguerite W; Bach, Lindsey M; Caples, Connor M; Beyer, Carl A; Grayson, John K; Meyers, Frederick J; Palmieri, Tina L; Brown, Ian E",Shock,206,1

This study aimed to evaluate the phenotype of multifunctional T cells in individuals 2 yr after exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV). We used a library of 671 synthetic peptides covering the whole polyprotein of ZIKV in pools corresponding to each viral protein (i.e., capsid, membrane precursor or prM, envelope, NS1 [nonstructural protein], NS2A + NS2B, NS3, NS4A + NS4B, and NS5) to stimulate PBMCs from individuals previously exposed to ZIKV. We observed an increased frequency of ZIKV-specific IFNγ, IL-17A, TNF, and IL-10 production by T cell populations. IFNγ and TNF production were especially stimulated by prM, capsid, or NS1 in CD8+ T cells and by capsid or prM in CD4+ T cells. In addition, there was an increase in the frequency of IL-10+ CD8+ T cells after stimulation with prM, capsid, NS1, NS3, or NS5. Multifunctional properties were observed in ZIKV-specific T cells responding especially to prM, capsid, NS1 or, to a smaller extent, NS3 antigens. For example, we found a consistent IFNγ + TNF+ CD8+ T cell population in response to most virus antigens and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that were IFNγ + IL-17A+ and IL-17A+IL-10+, which could also produce TNF, in response to capsid, prM, NS1, or NS3 stimulation. Interestingly, CD8+ T cells were more prone to a multifunctional phenotype than CD4+ T cells, and multifunctional T cells were more efficient at producing cytokines than single-function cells. This work provides relevant insights into the quality of ZIKV-specific T cell responses and ZIKV immunity.","Pereira Neto, Tertuliano Alves; Gonçalves-Pereira, Marcela Helena; de Queiroz, Camila Pereira; Ramos, Michele Faria; de Oliveira, Fernanda de Fátima Souza; Oliveira-Prado, Roberta; do Nascimento, Valdinete Alves; Abdalla, Ligia Fernandes; Santos, João Hugo Abdalla; Martins-Filho, Olindo Assis; Naveca, Felipe Gomes; Teixeira-Carvalho, Andrea; Santiago, Helton da Costa",Journal of leukocyte biology,206,1

The objective of this systematic review was to identify treatment failure definitions and their common components in the literature. METHODS Five electronic databases were searched from inception to March 2019. Two independent reviewers identified studies involving adults (age ≥ 18 years) with non-purulent SSTIs in which antimicrobial treatment failure was a defined outcome. There were no language restrictions. Only randomized trials or observational studies were included. RESULTS After screening 4953 abstracts, 26 studies (N = 6629 patients) met full inclusion criteria. Reported treatment failure ranged from 0 to 29.5%. The most common definition components were hospital admission (78.9%), change in antibiotics (65.4%), and persistent or worsening signs and symptoms of infection (34.6%). Only one study listed specific criteria for persistent or worsening signs and symptoms of infection. CONCLUSIONS For studies involving non-purulent SSTIs, the outcome of treatment failure is inconsistently defined and reported failure rates are highly variable. This systematic review has highlighted the need for more robust treatment failure definitions for non-purulent SSTIs. Research should focus on the development of a uniform treatment failure definition that should be used in future studies.","Yadav, Krishan; Nath, Avik; Suh, Kathryn N; Sikora, Lindsey; Eagles, Debra",Infection,206,1

METHODS Each cautery was used to perform six SSL porcine cholecystectomies. For MAGS, the cautery device was inserted through the umbilical incision, magnetically coupled, and deployed; two graspers and a laparoscope were used. For LAP, two percutaneous retraction sutures, one grasper, a hook cautery dissector, and a laparoscope were used. Operative outcomes, surgeon ratings (scale, 1-5; 1 = superior), and workload (scale, 1-10; 1 = superior) were evaluated. RESULTS No significant differences were detected for operative outcomes and surgeon ratings, however, trends were detected favoring MAGS. Surgeon workload ratings were significantly better for MAGS (2.6 ± 0.2) vs. LAP (5.6 ± 1.1; p < 0.05). For MAGS, depth perception and triangulation were excellent and the safe handling protocol was followed with no complications. For LAP, the parallelism of instruments and lack of triangulation hindered depth perception, caused instrument conflicts, and resulted in two minor complications (one superficial liver laceration and one inadvertent burn to the diaphragm). CONCLUSION These data suggest that using the MAGS device for SSL cholecystectomy results in equivalent (or better) operative outcomes and less workload compared with LAP.","Arain, Nabeel A; Cadeddu, Jeffrey A; Hogg, Deborah C; Bergs, Richard; Fernandez, Raul; Scott, Daniel J",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,206,16

Method: This interventional self-controlled retrospective study included 31 eyes of 31 patients with deep corneal ulcers who underwent conjunctival flap surgery in a tertiary eye care unit between 2017 and 2019. Of these, 9 eyes exhibited corneal perforation. The follow-up period was 12 months. The primary outcome measures were restoring ocular surface integrity and secondary outcome measures were improvement in visual acuity and postoperative complications encountered. Results: Out of the total of 31 patients, 17 patients (55%) were males and 14 patients (45%) were females. The mean age was 56.03 ± 15.46 years. The mean disease duration was 64.10 ± 35.01 days, the mean diameter of the ulcer was 3.61 ± 1.02 mm and the mean depth of the ulcer was 70.65 ± 20.28% of the thickness of the cornea. The etiology was extensive and the corneal ulcers were categorized as infectious (12), noninfectious (16), and unknown (3). An anatomic cure was obtained in 29 (94%) of 31 eyes. Conjunctival flap surgery was unsuccessful in 2 eyes that required evisceration. The postoperative visual acuity (BCVA) improved in 13 (42%) of the 31 eyes, decreased in 9 eyes (29%) and remained unchanged in 9 eyes (29%). The most frequent complications after conjunctival flap surgery were pseudopterygium, cataract and corneal opacity and less frequent complications were glaucoma, astigmatism, flap retraction, corneal perforation and endophthalmitis. Conclusions: Conjunctival flap surgery can successfully treat refractory deep corneal ulcers. It can restore ocular surface integrity and provide metabolic and mechanical support for corneal healing. Also, it can avoid emergency penetrating keratoplasty or create appropriate conditions for a future optic keratoplasty.","Stamate, Alina-Cristina; Tătaru, Călin Petru; Zemba, Mihail",Romanian journal of ophthalmology,206,31

Root coverage outcomes using platelet concentrates have gained increased interest. In particular, it has been suggested that adding L-PRF to CAF may provide further benefits in the treatment of GRs. Materials and Methods: An electronic and manual literature search was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RTCs) investigating root coverage outcomes with CAF + L-PRF. The outcomes of interest included mean root coverage (mRC), recession reduction, keratinized tissue width (KTW) gain, gingival thickness (GT) gain, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROms) such as pain perception and discomfort. Results: A total of 275 patients and 611 surgical sites were analyzed. L-PRF in adjunct to single CAF seems to show statistically significant results regarding clinical attachment level (CAL) with a weighted means (WM) 0.43 95% CI (-0.04,0.91), p < 0.0001, GT (WM 0.17 95% CI (-0.02,0.36), p < 0.0001, and mRC (WM 13.95 95% CI (-1.99,29.88) p < 0.0001, compared to single CAF alone. Interesting results were obtained from the adjunct of PRF to multiple CAF with respect to multiple CAF alone with an increase in the mRC WM 0.07 95% CI (-30.22,30.35), p = 0.0001, and PPD change WM 0.26 95% CI (-0.06,0.58), p < 00001. On the other hand, no statistically significant data were obtained when L-PRF was added to single or multiple CAF combined with CTG according to the included outcomes such as mRC (p = 0.03 overall). Conclusions: L-PRF is a valid alternative to CAF alone. L-PRF compared to CTG in single and multiple CAF showed statistically significant results regarding pain perception and discomfort PROms (p < 0.0001). However, CTG remains the gold standard for treating gingival recession.","Mancini, Leonardo; Tarallo, Francesco; Quinzi, Vincenzo; Fratini, Adriano; Mummolo, Stefano; Marchetti, Enrico",Medicina,206,1

In-office aerosol-generating procedures pose a risk to staff and patients while necessitating examination room shutdown to allow aerosol decontamination by indwelling ventilation. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers' effectiveness in eliminating airborne SARS-CoV-2 from indoor environments. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, Cochrane Databases, and the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease. REVIEW METHODS Data sources were systematically searched for original English-language published studies indexed up to January 14, 2021 per the following search strategy: (""HEPA"" OR ""High-efficiency"" OR ""High-efficiency particulate air"" OR ""Efficiency particulate"" OR ""Purifier"" OR ""Filter"" OR ""Cleaner"" OR ""Filtration"") AND (""COVID"" OR ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" OR ""Coronavirus""). Additional relevant studies were identified by searching the reference lists of included articles. RESULTS Eleven published studies have evaluated the effectiveness of portable HEPA purifiers in eliminating airborne SARS-CoV-2 with relevantly sized surrogate particles. Ten studies evaluated aerosols and submicron particles similar in size to SARS-CoV-2 virions. In all studies, portable HEPA purifiers were able to significantly reduce airborne SARS-CoV-2-surrogate particles. The addition of portable HEPA purifiers augmented other decontamination strategies such as ventilation. CONCLUSION Experimental studies provide evidence for portable HEPA purifiers' potential to eliminate airborne SARS-CoV-2 and augment primary decontamination strategies such as ventilation. Based on filtration rates, additional air exchanges provided by portable HEPA purifiers may be calculated and room shutdown times potentially reduced after aerosol-generating procedures.","Liu, David T; Philips, Katie M; Speth, Marlene M; Besser, Gerold; Mueller, Christian A; Sedaghat, Ahmad R",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,206,19

An important element of this work is the successful immunisation, especially in resource-poor countries. Mass immunisation, most intensively in the case of eradication, depends on a combination of reliable demand (e.g. public willingness to comply with the vaccine protocol) and effective supply (e.g. robust, generally state-led, vaccine delivery). This balance of compliance and enforceability is, quintessentially, socio-political in nature - conditioned by popular perceptions of disease and risk, wider conditions of economic development and poverty, technical aspects of vaccine delivery, and the prevailing international norms regarding power relations between states and peoples. In the past 100 years, three out of six disease eradication programmes have failed. The explanations for failure have focused on biotechnical and managerial or financial issues. Less attention is paid to socio-political aspects. Yet socio-political explanations are key. Eradication is neither inherently prone to failure, nor necessarily doomed in the case of polio. However, eradication, and similar mass immunisation initiatives, which fail to address social and political realities of intervention may be. A comparison of the smallpox and polio eradication programmes illustrates the importance of disease-specific socio-political analysis in programme conceptualisation, design, and management.","Taylor, S",Global public health,206,16

Some studies have cited statistically significant associations between adolescent social media use and depression and have proposed that parents must regulate their adolescents' social media use in order to protect their mental health. METHOD In order to rigorously assess the size of the effect that has been reported in the current scientific literature, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies that measured the association between social media use specifically and depressive symptoms amongst early- to mid- adolescents (11-18 years-old). We searched Psychnet, PubMed, and Web of Science with the following terms: online social networks, social media, internet usage, facebook, twitter, instagram, myspace, snapchat, and depression. RESULTS We found a small but significant positive correlation (k=12 studies, r=.11, p<.01) between adolescent social media use and depressive symptoms. There was also high heterogeneity (I2=95.22%) indicating substantial variation among studies. CONCLUSIONS High heterogeneity along with the small overall effect size observed in the relationship between self-reported social media use and depressive symptoms suggests that other factors are likely to act as significant moderators of the relationship. We suggest that future research should be focused on understanding which types of use may be harmful (or helpful) to mental health, rather than focusing on overall use measures that likely reflect highly heterogeneous exposures.","Ivie, Elizabeth J; Pettitt, Adam; Moses, Louis J; Allen, Nicholas B",Journal of affective disorders,206,0

STUDY DESIGN We used conditional logistic regression clustered by hospital and generalized estimating equations to compare the odds of unplanned all-cause 30-day readmission between Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) and Medicare Advantage (MA). DATA COLLECTION Wisconsin Health Information Organization collects claims data from various payers including private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid, twice a year. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS For 62 of 66 hospitals, hospital-level readmission rates for MA were lower than those for Medicare FFS. The odds of 30-day readmission in MA were 0.92 times lower than Medicare FFS within the same hospital (odds ratio, 0.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.89-0.98). The adjusted overall readmission rates of Medicare FFS and MA were 14.9 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively. CONCLUSION These findings provide additional evidence of potential variations in readmission risk by payer and support the need for improved monitoring systems in hospitals that incorporate payer-specific data. Further research is needed to delineate specific care delivery factors that contribute to differential readmission risk by payer source.","Jung, Daniel H; DuGoff, Eva; Smith, Maureen; Palta, Mari; Gilmore-Bykovskyi, Andrea; Mullahy, John",Health services research,206,1

Our literature review, which was based on a total of 39 works, revealed distinctive expressions of poverty among younger and older LGBTQ2S+ groups, as well as racialized, newcomer, and Indigenous sexual and gender minorities. Drawing on these insights, together with theoretical frameworks grounded in intersectionality and relational poverty analysis, we conceptualize these expressions of material inequity as salient sites of social work practice and propose interventions targeting these manifestations of LGBTQ2S+ poverty at various levels. Given the centrality of anti-poverty work as part of the social work profession's commitment to social justice, and the dearth of social work literature on LGBTQ2S+ poverty, this article promises to make significant contributions to social work scholarship and professional practice.","Kia, Hannah; Robinson, Margaret; MacKay, Jenna; Ross, Lori E",Research on social work practice,206,1

Whether stroke is a frequent complication of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. This study aimed to determine the proportion of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 cases with ischemic stroke and the proportion of pediatric strokes with SARS-CoV-2 in the first three months of the pandemic in an international cohort. METHODS We surveyed 61 international sites with pediatric stroke expertise. Survey questions included: numbers of hospitalized pediatric (≤18 years) SARS-CoV-2 patients; numbers of incident neonatal and childhood ischemic strokes; frequency of SARS-CoV-2 testing for pediatric stroke patients; and numbers of stroke cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 March 1-May 31, 2020. RESULTS Of 42 centers with SAR-CoV-2 hospitalization numbers, 8/971 (0.82%) with SARS-CoV-2 had ischemic strokes. Proportions of stroke cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 from March-May 2020 were: 1/108 neonatal AIS (0.9%), 0/33 neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT; 0%), 6/166 childhood AIS (3.6%), and 1/54 childhood CSVT (1.9%) cases. However, only 30.5% of neonates and 60% of children with strokes were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, these proportions represent 2.9%, 0%, 6.1%, and 3.0% of stroke cases tested for SARS-CoV-2. Seven of eight with SARS-CoV-2 had additional established stroke risk factors. INTERPRETATION As in adults, pediatric stroke is an infrequent complication of SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 was detected in only 4.7% of pediatric ischemic stroke patients tested. However, <50% of strokes were tested. SARS-CoV-2 testing should be considered in pediatric stroke patients as the pandemic continues to determine SARS-CoV-2's role in pediatric stroke.

On par with these technologies, exosomes act as a potential portal for cell-free drug delivery systems as these are bestowed with the native characteristics of the parent cell of origin. Exosomes, called extracellular vesicles (EcVs), are present in almost all cells, tissues, and body fluids. They help in intercellular signaling and maintains tissue homeostasis in the disease pathobiology. Researchers have characterized 9,769 proteins, 2,838 miRNAs, 3,408 mRNAs, and 1,116 lipids being present in exosomal cargo. The separation of exosomes from cells, tissues, and body fluids follow different patterned kinetics. Exosomes interact with the recipient cells through their surface receptor molecules and ligands and internalize within recipient cells through micropinocytosis and phagocytosis. Advancing technologies in regenerative medicine have facilitated the researchers to isolate exosomes from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as these cells are blessed with supreme regenerative potentiality in targeting a disease. Exosomal cargo is a key player in establishing the diagnosis and executing therapeutic role whilst regulating a disease process. Various in vitro studies have exhibited the safety, efficacy, and therapeutic potentiality of exosomes in various cancers, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and orthopedic diseases.

Both arterial and venous thromboembolic events (TE) due to alterations in the hemostatic system and prothrombotic state are widely reported in patients with CS, more so postoperatively. Increased mortality, if not appropriately treated, is largely due to cardiovascular events and infections. RECENT FINDINGS Patients with CS have markedly increased risk of thromboembolic episodes compared to the general population. The prothrombotic state is mediated by increased levels of procoagulant factors, but also by an impaired fibrinolytic capacity. All contribute to TE, atherosclerosis, and subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Some abnormalities progressively improve after CS remission, but do not fully normalize for at least 1 year or more. SUMMARY Due to the additional thrombotic risk of surgery or any invasive procedure, anticoagulation prophylaxis should be at least considered in patients with CS and balanced with individual bleeding risk. However, a clear protocol of thromboprophylaxis is lacking and increased awareness regarding risks per se is needed. Large prospective trials will clarify, which patients with CS are at the highest risk and the optimal prevention protocol to minimize risks and maximize efficacy.","Capatina, Cristina; Fleseriu, Maria","Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",206,23

Here we explored the mechanism through systematic proteomics analysis of the lithium chloride-pilocarpine rat model. Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal day 21, P21) were randomly divided into control (Ctr), seizure (SE), and KD treatment after seizure (SE + KD) groups. Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) were utilized to assess changes in protein abundance in the hippocampus. A total of 5,564 proteins were identified, of which 110 showed a significant change in abundance between the SE and Ctr groups (18 upregulated and 92 downregulated), 278 between SE + KD and SE groups (218 upregulated and 60 downregulated), and 180 between Ctr and SE + KD groups (121 upregulated and 59 downregulated) (all p < 0.05). Seventy-nine proteins showing a significant change in abundance between SE and Ctr groups were reciprocally regulated in the SD + KD group compared to the SE group (i.e., the seizure-induced change was reversed by KD). Of these, five (dystrobrevin, centromere protein V, oxysterol-binding protein, tetraspanin-2, and progesterone receptor membrane component 2) were verified by parallel reaction monitoring. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that proteins of the synaptic vesicle cycle pathway were enriched both among proteins differing in abundance between SE and Ctr groups as well as between SE + KD and SE groups. This comprehensive proteomics analyze of KD-treated epilepsy by quantitative proteomics revealed novel molecular mechanisms of KD antiepileptogenic efficacy and potential treatment targets.","Zheng, Yu-Qin; Jin, Mei-Fang; Suo, Gui-Hai; Wu, You-Jia; Sun, Yu-Xiao; Ni, Hong",Frontiers in neuroscience,206,31

With improvements in hygiene and sanitation, the burden of disease due to bacterial and parasitic infections has decreased and an increasing proportion of diarrhoea hospitalizations are attributed to viruses. This review focuses on enteric viruses and their role in childhood diarrhoea in the developing world. RECENT FINDINGS With the use of sensitive molecular techniques, it is evident that a significant proportion of childhood diarrhoea is attributable to enteric viruses, with at least one viral agent in nearly 43% of samples from childhood diarrhoea in developing countries. Rotaviruses remain the most common pathogens in children, followed by noroviruses in almost all countries. There is increasing evidence that both rotaviruses and caliciviruses spread beyond the gut in a large proportion of infections. SUMMARY The review highlights the importance of viral agents of gastroenteritis in developing countries. Wider use of molecular techniques is resulting in rapid identification of new or emerging strains and in the detection of extra-intestinal spread. There is a need to better understand susceptibility and immune response to these agents to be able to design suitable interventions.","Ramani, Sasirekha; Kang, Gagandeep",Current opinion in infectious diseases,206,1

With a quick spread of the outbreak from its origin, Wuhan, China, to almost all over the world, it has affected more than seven million people to date, hence it has devastated every part of the infrastructural skeleton of governance. Continuously escalating disease burden and lack of proven therapeutic approaches are mounting challenges to health scientists and ultimately to healthcare providers. Although recent studies have shown benefits in decreasing the severity and duration of the illness and there are more benefits compared to risks, plasma therapy cannot be considered as a standard of care until the ongoing trials are completed and they establish definite evidence on its therapeutic efficacy and safety. Though a beneficial aspect may be there, acquiring donors and adequate availability of plasma is equally challenging, and its associated untoward effects related to biological therapeutic agents. The rational practice of CP therapy guided by risk-benefit judgment from aspects of donor and recipient can be a therapeutic option in such a global health crisis.","Khadka, Sitaram; Nisar, Shameem; Syed, Nawazish-I-Husain; Shrestha, Dhan Bahadur; Budhathoki, Pravash",Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,206,6

Zero-heat-flux (ZHF) thermometry offers a non-invasive, measurement method that can be applied across all surgical phases. The purpose of this study was to measure agreement between the zero-heat-flux device and esophageal monitoring, sensitivity, and specificity to detect hypothermia and patient acceptability amongst patients undergoing upper and lower limb orthopedic surgery. Patients and Methods This prospective, observational study utilized Bland-Altman analysis and Lin's concordance coefficient to measure agreement between devices, sensitivity and specificity to detect hypothermia and assessed patient acceptability amongst 30 patients between December 2018 and June 2019. Results Bias was observed between devices via Bland Altman, with bias dependent on actual temperature. The mean difference ranged from -0.16°C at 34.9°C (where the mean of ZHF was lower than the esophageal device) to 0.46°C at 37.25°C (where the mean of ZHF was higher than esophageal device), with 95% limits of agreement (max) upper LOA = 0.80 to 1.41, lower LOA = -1.12 to -0.50. Seventy-five percentage of zero-heat-flux measurements were within 0.5°C of esophageal readings. Patient acceptability was high; 96% (n=27) stated that the device was comfortable. Conclusion ZHF device achieved lesser measurement accuracy with core (esophageal) temperature compared to earlier findings. Nonetheless, due to continuous capability, non-invasiveness and patient reported acceptability, the device warrants further evaluation.

In fact, they need a solid neuroscience foundation for their clinical experiences in all other medical disciplines also, because the nervous system plays such a critical role in the function of every organ system. Due to the rapid pace of neuroscience discoveries, it is unrealistic to expect students to master the entire field. It is also unnecessary, as students can expect to have ready access to electronic reference sources no matter where they practice. In the pre-clerkship phase of medical school, the focus should be on providing students with the foundational knowledge to use those resources effectively and interpret them correctly. This article describes an organizational framework for teaching the essential neuroscience background needed by all physicians. This is particularly germane at a time when many medical schools are re-assessing traditional practices and instituting curricular changes such as competency-based approaches, earlier clinical immersion, and increased emphasis on active learning. This article reviews factors that should be considered when developing the pre-clerkship neuroscience curriculum, including goals and objectives for the curriculum, the general topics to include, teaching and assessment methodology, who should direct the course, and the areas of expertise of faculty who might be enlisted as teachers or content experts. These guidelines were developed by a work group of experienced educators appointed by the Undergraduate Education Subcommittee (UES) of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN).

METHOD the sample consisted of 44 newborns, divided into two groups. The study group was composed of 22 premature newborns with intraventricular hemorrhage/and the control group was composed of 22 newborns without intraventricular hemorrhage, matched to the study group for gestational age, correct gestational age and sex. The groups were submitted to the evaluation of the inhibitory effect of auditory efferent in otoacoustic emissions (equipment ILOv6-Otodynamics Ltda®) and auditory evoked potential with and without contralateral noise (equipment SmartEP-Intelligent Hearing Systems®). RESULTS newborns with intraventricular hemorrhage exhibited a higher occurrence of central hearing alteration as well as a lesser occurrence of the inhibitory effect of auditory efferent in otoacoustic emissions and auditory evoked potential compared to the newborns without this condition. An association was found between central hearing alteration and a lower occurrence of inhibitory effect. Agreement was found between the inhibitory effect test on otoacoustic emissions and latency of the auditory evoked potential. CONCLUSION premature newborns with intraventricular hemorrhage have a greater occurrence of functional abnormality of the afferent auditory system, which can be effectively identified through an evaluation of the inhibitory effect of auditory efferent in otoacoustic emissions evoked by a transient stimulus and latency parameter in the brainstem auditory evoked potential.","Maruta, Elaine Colombo Sousa; Azevedo, Marisa Frasson de",CoDAS,206,1

However, it remains unknown whether accessibility of treatment affects patient choice of OAT. OBJECTIVES To investigate the association between distance to the treatment site and choice of OAT. METHODS Electronic records were collected for the last outpatient visits of individuals with OUD between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014. The address of each patient was processed using the Geographic Information System to obtain the distance between place of residence and the hospital. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the correlation between individual drug selection and distance of residence. Among the study population of 2804 patients (81.5% male), 74.1% were receiving methadone while 25.8% were receiving buprenorphine. The vast majority (95%) of all patients lived within 50 km of the hospital, so regression analysis was limited to this distance. Sensitivity analysis was estimated using robust Poisson regression. RESULTS Logistic regression revealed that every 1-km increase in distance from home to hospital increased the odds ratio of choosing sublingual buprenorphine tablets over methadone by 1.05 (p = .02, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.08). CONCLUSIONS Patients living closer to the treatment center were more likely to choose methadone as treatment, while patients living farther away were more likely to choose sublingual buprenorphine tablets. To mitigate the influence of travel distance on therapy choice, we recommend that more medical institutions participate in OAT services.","Wei, Lien-Chung; Chan, Hung-Yu",The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,206,19

The arsenal of drugs available is limited, and prolonged use of such drugs makes parasite to become resistant. Therefore, it is very imperative to develop a safe, cost-effective and inexpensive vaccine against VL. Although in recent years many strategies have been pursued by researchers, but so far only some of the vaccine candidates reached for clinical trial and more than half of them are still in pipeline. There is now a broad consent among Leishmania researchers that the perseverance of parasite is very essential for eliciting a protective immune response and may perhaps be attained by live attenuated parasite vaccination. For making a live attenuated parasite it is very essential to ensure that the parasite is deficient of virulence and should further study genetically modified parasites to perceive the mechanism of pathogenesis. So it is believed that in the near future, a complete understanding of the Leishmania genome will explore clear strategies to discover a novel vaccine.

However, a few recent studies have suggested the possible existence of other Iranian PPMV-1 genotypes/subgenotypes. Recently, we isolated a PPMV-1 closely related to the African origin subgenotype VI.2.1.2 from an ill captive pigeon in a park aviary in central Tehran (Pg/IR/AMMM160/2019). This subgenotype had never been reported from Iran or neighboring countries. We also isolated a subgenotype VII.1.1 NDV (Pg/IR/AMMM117/2018), usually reported from non-pigeon birds in Iran. The nucleotide distance of AMMM117 was 1.0-2.5% compared to other Iranian subgenotypes VII.1.1 isolates. However, usually the same year VII.1.1 viruses that we isolate from Iranian poultry farms show negligible distances (0.0-0.5%). More isolates are required to study if this difference is due to subgenotype VII.1.1 being circulated and mutated in pigeons. Here, we also characterized two other isolates, namely Pg/IR/AMMM168/2019 and Pg/IR/MAM39/2017. The latter is the first Iranian subgenotype XXI.1.1 to be featured in the NDV datasets of the international NDV consortium. We also investigated the phylogenetic relation of all the published Iranian pigeon-derived NDV to date and updated the grouping according to the latest classification system. We have concluded that at least six different groups of pigeon-derived NDV have been circulating in Iran since 1996, four of which have been reported from just one city over the last seven years. This study suggests that the Iranian pigeon-origin NDV have been more diverse than the Iranian poultry-derived NDV in recent years.","Molouki, Aidin; Soltani, Mohammad; Akhijahani, Mohsen Mahmoudzadeh; Merhabadi, Mohammad Hossein Fallah; Abtin, Alireza; Shoushtari, Abdelhamid; Langeroudi, Arash Ghalyanchi; Lim, Swee Hua Erin; Allahyari, Esmaeel; Abdoshah, Mohammad; Pourbakhsh, Seyed Ali",Current microbiology,206,31

Although below-knee stockings are used more often than thigh-length stockings, no reliable evidence indicates that they are as effective as thigh-length stockings. OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of thigh-length stockings with that of below-knee stockings for preventing proximal DVT in immobile, hospitalized patients with stroke. DESIGN Parallel-group trial with centralized randomization (minimization within centers) to ensure allocation concealment. The ultrasonographers who looked for DVT were blinded, but the patients and caregivers were not. (Controlled-trials.com registration number: ISRCTN28163533) SETTING 112 hospitals in 9 countries. PATIENTS 3114 immobile patients hospitalized with acute stroke between January 2002 and May 2009. INTERVENTION 1552 patients received thigh-length stockings and 1562 patients received below-knee stockings to wear while they were in the hospital. MEASUREMENTS Ultrasonographers performed compression duplex ultrasonography in 1406 patients (96% of survivors) in each treatment group between 7 and 10 days after enrollment. They performed a second scan in 643 patients in the thigh-length stockings group and 639 in the below-knee stockings group at about 25 to 30 days. The primary outcome was symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT in the popliteal or femoral veins, detected on either scan. RESULTS Patients were retained in their assigned group for all analyses. The primary outcome occurred in 98 patients (6.3%) who received thigh-length stockings and 138 (8.8%) who received below-knee stockings (absolute difference, 2.5 percentage points [95% CI, 0.7 to 4.4 percentage points]; P = 0.008), an odds reduction of 31% (CI, 9% to 47%). Seventy-five percent of patients in both groups wore the stockings for 30 days or until they were discharged, died, or regained mobility. Skin breaks occurred in 61 patients who received thigh-length stockings (3.9%) and 45 (2.9%) who received below-knee stockings. LIMITATION Blinding was incomplete, 2 scans were not obtained for all enrolled patients, and the trial was stopped before the target accrual was reached. CONCLUSION Proximal DVT occurs more often in patients with stroke who wear below-knee stockings than in those who wear thigh-length stockings.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether, after gastric-bypass surgery, the degree of weight loss can be differentiated based on the neural response to food cues. DESIGN AND METHODS In this functional MRI study, 31 post-surgical patients viewed food and neutral images in two counterbalanced runs during which they were either instructed to ""crave"" or to ""resist"" craving. The neural response to food cues was assessed within and between runs for all participants, and further analyzed between more successful (n = 24) and less successful (n = 7) groups. More successful was defined by meeting 50% excess weight loss. RESULTS Overall, instructions to ""crave"" elicited significant activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) whereas ""resist"" elicited significant activity in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC). Between groups there was no brain difference when instructed to ""crave."" The more successful participants however had significantly more activity in the DLPFC when instructed to ""resist.""

This single-sample metabolite, protein and lipid extraction (MPLEx) method resulted in complete inactivation of clinically important bacterial and viral pathogens with exposed lipid membranes, including Yersinia pestis, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Campylobacter jejuni in pure culture, and Yersinia pestis, Campylobacter jejuni, and West Nile, MERS-CoV, Ebola, and influenza H7N9 viruses in infection studies.

The overall pipeline of inactivation and subsequent proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic analyses was evaluated using a human epithelial lung cell line infected with wild-type and mutant influenza H7N9 viruses, thereby demonstrating that MPLEx yields biomaterial of sufficient quality for subsequent multi-omics analyses. Based on these experimental results, we believe that MPLEx will facilitate systems biology studies of infectious samples by enabling simultaneous pathogen inactivation and multi-omics measurements from a single specimen with high success for pathogens with exposed lipid membranes.","Burnum-Johnson, Kristin E; Kyle, Jennifer E; Eisfeld, Amie J; Casey, Cameron P; Stratton, Kelly G; Gonzalez, Juan F; Habyarimana, Fabien; Negretti, Nicholas M; Sims, Amy C; Chauhan, Sadhana; Thackray, Larissa B; Halfmann, Peter J; Walters, Kevin B; Kim, Young-Mo; Zink, Erika M; Nicora, Carrie D; Weitz, Karl K; Webb-Robertson, Bobbie-Jo M; Nakayasu, Ernesto S; Ahmer, Brian; Konkel, Michael E; Motin, Vladimir; Baric, Ralph S; Diamond, Michael S; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Waters, Katrina M; Smith, Richard D; Metz, Thomas O",The Analyst,206,24

OBJECTIVE This review aimed to discuss the main vaccines available, their mechanisms of action, results of clinical trials and epidemiological behavior. The implications of viral variants were also debated. METHODS A non-systematic literature review was performed between February and March 2021 by searching the Pubmed, Scopus, and SciELO databases, using different combinations of the following terms: ""vaccines"", ""clinical trials"" , ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""Coronavirus"", ""COVID-19"", ""mechanisms of action"". Data regarding clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and epidemiological information were also searched. RESULTS The mechanisms of action included vector-virus, mRNA and inactivated virus vaccines. The vaccines showed positive results in phases 2/3 clinical trials. The efficacy of the mRNA 1273 and of mRNA BNT 162b2 vaccines were 94.1% and 95%, respectively. The effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine varied according to the scheme, with an overall value of 70.4%. The Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine had an efficacy of 91.6%. Regarding the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, 99% or more of seroconversion was observed in all subgroups 29 days after vaccination. The CoronaVac vaccine induced an immune response in 92% of the volunteers receiving 3ug and in 98% with 6ug, in comparison to 3% in the placebo group. CONCLUSION Global efforts have resulted in vaccines available in record time, with good safety and immunogenicity profile. However, only long-term studies can provide more information on duration of immunity and the need for additional doses.","Damasceno, Douglas Henrique Pereira; Amaral, Arthur Aguiar; Silva, Cecília Andrade; Simões E Silva, Ana Cristina",Current medicinal chemistry,206,1

A recommendation was issued to postpone all elective surgical practices. However, some confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients required life-saving emergent surgeries. METHODS To facilitate emergent surgical interventions for these patients, we have reviewed the current literature and established an algorithm of precautions to be taken by operating room team members during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS The initial algorithm of preparation for surgical intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic was relatively simple. However, the abrupt increase of confirmed COVID-19 cases due to returned overseas travelers since mid-March, 2020, disrupted the routine hospital clinical service. Due to the large number of febrile patients, the algorithm was therefore revised according to travel history, occupation, contact and cluster history (TOCC), unexplained fever/symptoms and emergent/non-emergent surgery. TOCC (+) patients presenting with otherwise unexplained fever/symptoms would be regarded as belonging to the fifth category of ""severe special infectious pneumonia."" If the patient requires emergent surgery to relieve the non-life-threatening disorders, two times of negative COVID-19 tests are necessary before the operation is approved. For life-threatening situations without two negative results of COVID-19 tests, the operation schedule should be approved by the Chairman of Surgery Management Committee. CONCLUSION The application of a clear and integrated algorithm for operating room team members aids in effective personal protective equipment facilitation to keep both healthcare providers and patients safe as well as to prevent hospital-based transmission of COVID-19.","Hung, Jung-Jyh; Wang, Fu-Der; Ma, Hsu; Tsou, Mei-Yung; Dai, Hung-Da; Lin, Yi-Han; Chen, Wei-Ming; Liu, Chin-Su",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,206,1

Our objective was to investigate the link between an alleged celebrity suicide and further suicidal behaviour in the community in India. METHODS Relevant news articles that reported suicidal behaviour in the population were retrieved from online news portals of regional and English language newspapers in the immediate month following the actor's death. A deductive analysis of the retrieved suicide news articles was carried out using a pre-designed data extraction form. RESULTS A total of 1160 relevant news articles were identified from the local language (n = 985) and English (n = 175) newspapers. For a sizeable percentage of these reports (n = 65, 5.6%), the media reported links with celebrity suicide. Odds of subsequent suicide among young (Odds Ratios [OR] - 9.24), female (OR - 1.94), unemployed (OR - 7.26), those without precipitating life events (OR - 2.94) or mental illness (OR - 1.69) were higher among those with link to celebrity suicide; likewise, odds of death by hanging (OR - 49.84) and leaving a suicide note (OR - 2.03) were higher among those linked to celebrity suicide. English newspapers (OR - 4.23) were more likely to report events linked to celebrity suicide than local language newspapers. CONCLUSION Persons who died by suicide by hanging after a celebrity suicide are more likely to be young, female, unemployed, have a mental disorder or precipitating life events. Suicide prevention efforts must focus on this group and prevent the same method of suicide like that of the celebrity.","Menon, Vikas; Kar, Sujita Kumar; Marthoenis, Marthoenis; Arafat, Sm Yasir; Sharma, Ginni; Kaliamoorthy, Charanya; Ransing, Ramdas; Mukherjee, Srijeeta; Pattnaik, Jigyansa Ipsita; Shirahatti, Nikhilesh B; Varadharajan, Natarajan; Padhy, Susanta Kumar",The International journal of social psychiatry,206,33

METHODS All children with highly suspected COVID-19 were included. Anti-nucleoprotein SARS-CoV-2 were measured using SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA kits. Hypothesis testing was carried out through SPSS to unravel any association between the measurement tools and important clinical and laboratory characteristics. RESULTS In this study, 254 patients were evaluated and 117 cases (46%) were male. The nucleic acid detection results for patient 55 were negative, but the IgM and IgG results were positive. Totally, 190 patients were tested for IgM in which only 14 (7.3%) had positive tests. Positive IgG was detected in 51 (20%) out of 254 patients; among them, 30 patients had negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (59%). Lower level of platelets in IgG positive group in comparison with the IgG negative group was observed (P value: 0.015). Moreover, higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was observed in the in IgG positive group (P value: 0.02). In patients with positive IgM, relative hypocalcemia (median of 8.25; IQR: 8.02-8.62) was found which appeared to be significant (P value: 0.02).

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 94 patients with 174 hepatic tumors referred for CT-guided MWA were included in this retrospective institutional review board-approved study. One hundred and twenty-five tumors (median size 17 mm, range 12-24 mm) with subcapsular location (n = 91) and/or in which a transpleural approach was applied (n = 53) were identified (group 1) and compared to tumors with a central intrahepatic location (group 2; n = 49, median size 19 mm, range 12-23 mm). Technical success, complications and local tumor progression (LTP) were evaluated. Risk factors were analyzed using univariate analysis, logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier curves (p < 0.05 deemed significant). RESULTS Technical success was 100% in both groups. In group 1, complications occurred in n = 31 tumors (24.8%; pneumothorax n = 20; hematoma n = 11). Complications occurred significantly less often in group 2 (8.2%; n = 4 (hematoma); p = 0.011). There were no major complications. Transpleural approach and number of capsule punctures were identified as risk factors for complications (all p < 0.05). Median follow-up was 265 days. LTP was comparable between both groups (13.6 vs. 10.2%; p = 0.41). Use of hydrodissection was the only independent factor associated with LTP (p = 0.03, HR 3.29). CONCLUSION CT-guided hepatic MWA of subcapsular tumors and subdiaphragmatic tumors requiring a direct or transpleural approach is feasible with increased minor but not major complications. LTP did not differ significantly between both groups.","Vo Chieu, Van Dai; Werncke, Thomas; Hensen, Bennet; Wacker, Frank; Ringe, Kristina I",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,206,13

The model includes a cylindrical tissue environment with a 5 mm vessel placed parallel to and 15 mm way from either a Covidien Energy-based Devices Evident MW Ablation Percutaneous Antenna or a CoolTip RF Ablation Single Electrode Kit. An array of fiber optic thermal probes is used to monitor radial temperature profile on the vessel and non-vessel sides of the ablation zone. Circulating blood exhibits higher electrical conductivity than surrounding liver tissue and provides a significant means for transport of thermal energy. Data from the thermal probes indicate key performance differentiators between MW and RF ablation modalities when they are used next to large blood vessels clarifying the difference between thermal and electrical energy sink. The results suggest RFA is susceptible to both the thermal and electrical energy sink effects of large vasculature while MWA is only susceptible to thermal sink.

However, health systems and patients may find it difficult to complete an early postdischarge clinic visit, especially during the current pandemic. We evaluated the effect on 30-day readmission and death of follow-up within 7 days postdischarge guided by an initial structured nonphysician telephone visit compared with follow-up guided by an initial clinic visit with a physician. METHODS AND RESULTS We conducted a pragmatic randomized trial in a large integrated healthcare delivery system. Adults being discharged home after hospitalization for heart failure were randomly assigned to either an initial telephone visit with a nurse or pharmacist to guide follow-up or an initial in-person clinic appointment with primary care physicians providing usual care within the first 7 days postdischarge. Telephone appointments included a structured protocol enabling medication titration, laboratory ordering, and booking urgent clinic visits as needed under physician supervision. Outcomes included 30-day readmissions and death and frequency and type of completed follow-up within 7 days of discharge. Among 2091 participants (mean age 78 years, 44% women), there were no significant differences in 30-day heart failure readmission (8.6% telephone, 10.6% clinic, P=0.11), all-cause readmission (18.8% telephone, 20.6% clinic, P=0.30), and all-cause death (4.0% telephone, 4.6% clinic, P=0.49). Completed 7-day follow-up was higher in 1027 patients randomized to telephone follow-up (92%) compared with 1064 patients assigned to physician clinic follow-up (79%, P<0.001). Overall frequency of clinic visits during the first 7 days postdischarge was lower in participants assigned to nonphysician telephone guided follow-up (48%) compared with physician clinic-guided follow-up (77%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Early, structured telephone follow-up after hospitalization for heart failure can increase 7-day follow-up and reduce in-person visits with comparable 30-day clinical outcomes within an integrated care delivery framework.

There is a need to evaluate how this global shift has impacted patient care, healthcare providers, patient and carer experience, and health systems. Objective: We explored GPs' perspectives on the main benefits and challenges of using digital remote care. Methods: GPs across 20 countries completed an online questionnaire between June - September 2020. GPs' perceptions on main barriers and challenges were explored using free-text questions. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Results: 1,605 respondents participated in our survey. The benefits identified included reducing COVID-19 transmission risks, guaranteeing access and continuity of care, improved efficiency, faster access to care, improved convenience and communication with patients, greater work flexibility for providers, and hastening the digital transformation of primary care and the accompanying legal frameworks. Main challenges included patient's preference for face-to-face consultations, digital exclusion, lack of physical examinations, clinical uncertainty, delays in diagnosis and treatment, overuse and misuse of digital remote care, and unsuitability for certain types of consultations. Other challenges include the lack of formal guidance, higher workloads, remuneration issues, organisational culture, technical difficulties, implementation and financial issues, and regulatory weaknesses. Conclusion: At the frontline of care delivery, GPs can provide important insights on what worked well, why, and how.

However, implementing RNA-Seq analysis pipelines in a reproducible, flexible manner is challenging as data gets bigger and more complex. Thus, there is a pressing requirement for frameworks that allows for fast, efficient, easy-to-manage, and reproducibile analysis. Simple scripting has many challenges and drawbacks. We have developed a python package, python RNA-Seq Pipeliner (pyrpipe) that enables straightforward development of flexible, reproducible and easy-to-debug computational pipelines purely in python, in an object-oriented manner. pyrpipe provides access to popular RNA-Seq tools, within python, via easy-to-use high level APIs. Pipelines can be customized by integrating new python code, third-party programs, or python libraries. Users can create checkpoints in the pipeline or integrate pyrpipe into a workflow management system, thus allowing execution on multiple computing environments. pyrpipe produces detailed analysis, and benchmark reports which can be shared or included in publications. pyrpipe is implemented in python and is compatible with python versions 3.6 and higher.

180765,180765,180765,Thrombocytopenia in COVID Parturients: Is Less More of a Concern?,19.892036,9.738251,2020,"We develop tools to explore and catalogue the topologies of knotted or pseudoknotted circular folds due to secondary and tertiary interactions within a closed loop of RNA which generate multiple double-helices due (for example) to strand complementarity. The fold topology is captured by a ‘contracted fold’ which merges helices separated by bulges and removes hairpin loops. Contracted folds are either trivial or pseudoknotted. Strand folding is characterised by a rigid-vertex ‘polarised strand graph’, whose vertices correspond to double-helices and edges correspond to strands joining those helices. Each vertex has a plumbline whose polarisation direction defines the helical axis. That polarised graph has a corresponding circular ribbon diagram and canonical alphanumeric fold label. Key features of the ‘fully-flagged’ fold are the arrangement of complementary domains along the strand, described by a numerical bare fold label, and a pair of binary ‘flags’: a parity flag that specifies the twist in each helix (even or odd half-twists), and an orientation flag that characterises each double-helix as parallel or antiparallel. A simple algorithm is presented to translate an arbitrary fold label into a polarised strand graph. Any embedding of the graph in 3-space is an admissible fold geometry; the simplest embeddings minimise the number of edge-crossings in a planar graph drawing. If that number is zero, the fold lies in one of two classes: (a)-type ‘relaxed’ folds, which contain conventional junctions and (b)-type folds whose junctions are described as meso-junctions in H. Wang and N.C. Seeman, Biochem, vol. 34, pp920-929. (c)-type folds induce polarised strand graphs with edge-crossings, regardless of the planar graph drawing. Canonical fold labelling allows us to sort and enumerate all ‘semi-flagged’ folds with up to six contracted double-helices as windings around the edges of a graph-like fold skeleton, whose cyclomatic number - the ‘fold genus’ - ranges from 0 – 3, resulting in a pair of duplexed strands along each skeletal edge. Those semi-flagged folds admit both even and odd double-helical twists. Appending specific parity flags to those semi-flagged folds gives fully-flagged (a)-type folds, which are also enumerated up to genus-3 cases. We focus on all-antiparallel folds, characteristic of conventional ssRNA and enumerate all distinct (a), (b) and (c)-type folds with up to five double-helices. Those circular folds lead to pseudoknotted folds for linear ssRNA strands. We describe all linear folds derived from (a) or (b)-type circular folds with up to four contracted double-helices, whose simplest cases correspond to so-called H, K and L pseudoknotted folds, detected in ssRNA. Fold knotting is explored in detail, via constructions of so-called antifolds and isomorphic folds. We also tabulate fold knottings for (a) and (b)-type folds whose embeddings minimise the number of edge-crossings and outline the procedure for (c)-type folds. The inverse construction - from a specific knot to a suitable nucleotide sequence - results in a hierarchy of knots. A number of specific alternating knots with up to 10 crossings emerge as favoured fold designs for ssRNA, since they are readily constructed as (a)-type all-antiparallel folds.","Hyde, Stephen T.",bioRxiv,206,1

Hundreds of thousands more people with persistent olfactory dysfunction will be added to this number due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with loss-of-function mutations in SCN9A, the gene encoding NaV1.7, experience anosmia in addition to congenital insensitivity to pain. Tsp1a is a recently discovered peptide that inhibits NaV1.7 with high potency and selectivity. In this study, we examined whether a fluorescently tagged version of Tsp1a could be used to visualize normal and damaged mouse olfactory nerves. Methods Athymic nude mice were intravenously injected with Tsp1a-IR800. As a control, mice were injected with PBS only, and as a blocking control were injected with combination of Tsp1a and Tsp1a-IR800. All mice were imaged in-vivo and epifluorescence images were acquired using an IVIS Spectrum animal imaging system. Semiquantitative analysis of the Tsp1a-IR800 signal was conducted by measuring the average radiant efficiency in the region of the olfactory epithelium/bulb (ROEB). Methimazole was used to chemically ablate the olfactory epithelium. We performed a food buried test to correlate the level of anosmia with the level of radiance efficiency. Results The area of olfactory epithelium/bulb was clearly visible in epifluorescence in-vivo images of mice receiving the imaging agent. The radiant efficiency was significantly less in both mice injected with PBS and in mice injected with the blocking formulation. The mice after olfactory ablation had a significantly reduced radiant efficiency compared with normal mice. Moreover, there was a statistically significant and inverse correlation between the time required for the mouse to find buried food and the radiant efficiency. We also performed immunohistochemistry using NaV1.7 antibody. Mice after olfactory ablation as well as COVID-19-infected mice had significantly lower expression of NaV1.7 on the level of olfactory epithelium/bulb. Conclusion We show that the fluorescent imaging of mouse olfactory epithelium/bulb is possible, suggesting that labeled Tsp1a tracers may serve as the first objective diagnostic tool of smell disorders, including those caused by COVID-19.","Adilbay, Dauren; Gonzales, Junior; de Souza Franca, Paula Demetrio; Roberts, Sheryl; Patel, Snehal; Viray, Tara; Chow, Chun Yuen; King, Glenn F.; Jain, Sanjay K.; Ordonez, Alvaro A.; Carroll, Laurence S.; Pillarsetty, Nagavarakishore; Reiner, Thomas",bioRxiv,206,22

We explored how to furnish an android robot with socially motivated expressions geared toward eliciting adherence to COVID-19 guidelines. We analyzed how different behaviors associated with social expressions in such situations occur in Human-Human Interaction (HHI) and designed a scenario where a robot utilizes context-inspired behaviors (polite, gentle, displeased, and angry) to enforce social compliance. We then implemented these behaviors in an android robot and subjectively evaluated how effectively it expressed them and how they were perceived in terms of their appropriateness, effectiveness, and tendency to enforce social compliance to COVID-19 guidelines. We also considered how the subjects' sense of values regarding compliance awareness would affect the robot's behavior impressions. Our evaluation results indicated that participants generally preferred polite behaviors by a robot, although participants with different levels of compliance awareness manifested different trends toward appropriateness and effectiveness for social compliance enforcement through negative expressions by the robot. © 2016 IEEE.","Ajibo, C.

The particulate concentrations were 3 and 10 mg/m3. Markers of inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage showed that DEE (but not RASS) produced a dose-related and persistent inflammatory response. Lung weights were increased markedly in the DEE (but not RASS) groups and did not decrease during the 6-month post-exposure period. Bulky lung DNA adducts increased in the RASS groups, but not in the DEE groups. Cell proliferation in the lungs was unaffected by either experimental treatment. Histopathological responses in the RASS groups were minimal and almost completely reversible; lung tumors were similar in number to those seen in the sham-exposed groups. Rats exposed to DEE showed a panoply of dose-related histopathological responses: largely irreversible and in some cases progressive. Malignant and multiple tumors were seen only in the DEE groups; after 30 months, the tumor incidence (predominantly bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas) was 2% in the sham-exposed groups, 5%in the high RASS groups, and 46% in the high DEE groups (sexes combined). Our results suggest that in rats exposed to DEE, but not to RASS, the following series of events occurs: particle deposition in lungs --> lung ""overload"" --> pulmonary inflammation --> tumorigenesis, without a significant modifying role of cell proliferation or DNA adduct formation.","Stinn, Walter; Teredesai, Ashok; Anskeit, Erwin; Rustemeier, Klaus; Schepers, Georg; Schnell, Peter; Haussmann, Hans-Juergen; Carchman, Richard A; Coggins, Christopher R E; Reininghaus, Wolf",Inhalation toxicology,206,8

The position of bands at 630, 802, and 1120 base pairs on agarose gel confirmed the presence of rotavirus, TAstV-2, and reovirus, respectively. This mRT-PCR was found to be specific as no amplification was observed with avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, turkey coronavirus, avian metapneumovirus, and intestinal contents of uninfected turkey poults. Intestinal contents of poults from flocks suspected of exhibiting ""poult enteritis syndrome"" were pooled and tested. Of the 120 pooled samples tested, 70% were positive for TAstV-2, 45% for avian rotavirus, and 18% for avian reovirus. These three viruses were detected alone or in different combinations. Of the samples tested, 20% were negative for these three viruses, 38% were positive for a single virus (TAstV or rotavirus or reovirus), and 42% were positive for two or three viruses.

The deletion removes 29 amino acids that constitute a putative spacer region preceding the carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein. As a step toward understanding the structure and function of the MHV N protein, we isolated multiple independent revertants of Alb4 that totally or partially regained the ability to form large (wild-type-sized) plaques at the nonpermissive temperature. The N proteins of these revertant viruses concomitantly regained the ability to bind to RNA in vitro at a temperature that was restrictive for RNA binding by Alb4 N protein. Sequence analysis of the N genes of the revertants revealed that each contained a single second-site point mutation that compensated for the effects of the deletion. All reverting mutations were clustered within a stretch of 40 amino acids centered some 80 residues on the amino side of the Alb4 deletion, within a domain to which the RNA-binding activity of N had been previously mapped. By means of a targeted RNA recombination method that we have recently developed, two of the reverting mutations were introduced into a wild-type MHV genomic background. The resulting recombinants were stable and showed no gross phenotypic differences from the wild type. A detailed analysis of one, however, revealed that it was at a selective disadvantage with respect to the wild type.","Peng, D; Koetzner, C A; Masters, P S",Journal of virology,206,17

This study was performed in the surgical department of COVID hospital on the basis of the Clinical Hospital No. 4 of the First Moscow State Medical University named I.M. Sechenov (Sechenov University). During the period from April 2020 to February 2021, 32 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and the presence of venous trophic ulcers (VTU) of the lower extremities were treated. All patients underwent complex therapy for viral pneumonia in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. The protease inhibitor Aprotinin (Gordox ™) was used to improve microcirculation and prevent the development of a ""cytokine storm"". To accelerate the cleansing and epithelialization of venous trophic ulcers, the surface of the trophic ulcer was treated with an air plasma flow of NO and injections into the trophic ulcer of autoplasma. Against the background of complex treatment, all patients showed positive dynamics of the clinical picture: relief of hyperthermia, increase or stabilization of SpO2 values from 95% and above, significant decrease in CRP, LDH, D-dimer indices, increase in the number of lymphocytes, decrease in the VTU area by 1.5 times, active granulation and marginal epithelialization of the ulcer. In 14 patients (43.8%), complete epithelialization of the VTU defect was noted by the end of the third week. According to the CIVIQ-20 questionnaire, all 32 patients participating in the study showed positive dynamics. There were no lethal outcomes. Multicomponent therapy of decompensated forms of CVI of the lower extremities in the COVID hospital in patients with moderate severity of coronavirus infection with the use of proteolysis inhibitors leads to a rapid relief of symptoms of intoxication, prevents the progression of lung tissue and parenchymal organ damage and contributes to the positive dynamics of healing of ulcerative defects in the vast majority of patients.","Krylov, A; Khorobrykh, T; Petrovskaya, A; Gandybina, E; Gogokhia, T; Mansurova, G",Georgian medical news,206,9

METHODS Children with MPP hospitalized between October 2015 and December 2016 were selected as study subjects. According to the diagnostic criteria, children were divided into RMPP group (n=152) and MPP group (n=551). The differences between the two groups in the basic situation, clinical manifestations, infection parameters and myocardial enzymes were compared. RESULTS There were no significant differences in gender and age between the RMPP and MPP groups (P>0.05). The peak temperature in the RMPP group was significantly higher than that in the MPP group on the first day of admission (P<0.01). The percentage of children with augmentation in the RMPP group was lower than that in the MPP group (P=0.009). The percentage of neutrophils [Ne(%)] and serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels in the RMPP group were both higher than those in the MPP group (P<0.05), while the percentage of lymphocytes was significantly lower in the RMPP group (P<0.05). The serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the RMPP group were also higher than those in the MPP group (P<0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the peak temperature and LDH were closely related to RMPP in children (P<0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the peak temperature and LDH for the diagnosis of RMPP was 0.647 and 0.637 respectively. In children ≤2 years old, when the threshold value of LDH was 400 U/L, the diagnostic sensitivity was 52.63% and the specificity was 54.84%. In children above 2 years old, when the threshold value of LDH was 335 U/L, the diagnostic sensitivity was 69.92% and the specificity was 51.55%. CONCLUSIONS The children with RMPP have a high fever in the early stage. Meanwhile there are abnormal laboratory test results in these children. Elevated serum LDH levels have a high clinical value of early diagnosis of RMPP, especially in children above 2 years.","Xu, Jiang-Jiang; Shu, Lin-Hua",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,206,9

We investigated the effects of an epitope-specific CD8(+) T-cell response on acute infection of MHV, strain A59, in the murine CNS. Mice with CD8(+) T cells specific for gp33-41 (an H-2D(b)-restricted CD8(+) T-cell epitope derived from lymphocytic choriomeningitis glycoprotein) were infected with a recombinant MHV-A59, also expressing gp33-41, as a fusion protein with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). By 5 days postinfection, these mice showed significantly (approximately 20-fold) lower titers of infectious virus in the brain compared to control mice. Furthermore mice with gp33-41-specific CD8(+) cells exhibited much reduced levels of viral antigen in the brain as measured by immunohistochemistry using an antibody directed against viral nucleocapsid. More than 90% of the viruses recovered from brain lysates of such protected mice, at 5 days postinfection, had lost the ability to express EGFP and had deletions in their genomes encompassing EGFP and gp33-41. In addition, genomes of viruses from about half the plaques that retained the EGFP gene had mutations within the gp33-41 epitope. On the other hand, gp33-41-specific cells failed to protect perforin-deficient mice from infection by the recombinant MHV expressing gp33, indicating that perforin-mediated mechanisms were needed. Virus recovered from perforin-deficient mice did not exhibit loss of EGFP expression and the gp33-41 epitope. These observations suggest that the cytotoxic T-cell response to gp33-41 exerts a strong immune pressure that quickly selects epitope escape mutants to gp33-41.","Chua, Ming Ming; MacNamara, Katherine C; San Mateo, Lani; Shen, Hao; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,206,1

Cystatin C is an endogenous cysteine proteinase inhibitor belonging to the type 2 cystatin superfamily. The mature, active form of human cystatin C is a single non-glycosylated polypeptide chain consisting of 120 amino acid residues, with a molecular mass of 13,343-13,359 Da, and containing four characteristic disulfide-paired cysteine residues. Human cystatin C is encoded by the CST3 gene, ubiquitously expressed at moderate levels. Cystatin C monomer is present in all human body fluids; it is preferentially abundant in cerebrospinal fluid, seminal plasma, and milk. Cystatin C L68Q variant is an amyloid fibril-forming protein with a high tendency to dimerize. It forms self-aggregates with massive amyloid deposits in the brain arteries of young adults, leading to lethal cerebral hemorrhage. The main catabolic site of cystatin C is the kidney: more than 99% of the protein is cleared from the circulation by glomerular ultrafiltration and tubular reabsorption. The diagnostic value of cystatin C as a marker of kidney dysfunction has been extensively investigated in multiple clinical studies on adults, children, and in the elderly. In almost all the clinical studies, cystatin C demonstrated a better diagnostic accuracy than serum creatinine in discriminating normal from impaired kidney function, but controversial results have been obtained by comparing this protein with other indices of kidney disease, especially serum creatinine-based equations. In this review, we present and discuss most of the available data from the literature, critically reviewing conclusions and suggestions for the use of cystatin C in clinical practice. Despite the multitude of clinical data in the literature, cystatin C has not been widely used, perhaps because of a combination of factors, such as a general diffidence among clinicians, the absence of definitive cut-off values, conflicting results in clinical studies, no clear evidence on when and how to request the test, the poor commutability of results, and no accurate examination of costs and of its routine use in a stat laboratory.","Mussap, Michele; Plebani, Mario",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,206,16

RECENT FINDINGS: SAP-E sets targets for the implementation of evidence-based preventive actions and stroke services to 2030. A recent mapping of stroke care in Europe has documented massive inequalities and even in high-income European countries access to reperfusion therapy and mortality after ischaemic stroke varies significantly. Organized stroke care providing stroke unit care and access to reperfusion therapies reduces mortality and long-term disability. Stroke prevention and care are highly cost-effective. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged organized care, diverged attention from stroke and necessitated a novel approach to the implementation program because of the continued need for social distancing and reduced travelling. Consequently, meetings, training and engagement will be handled by online resources. SUMMARY: Stroke can be prevented and treated but there remain massive inequalities in Europe. SAP-E has set targets for development of stroke care. COVID-19 pandemic has led to further challenges for stroke care and implementation of the Action Plan will rely on online meetings and resources as it is yet unforeseeable when things will return to normal.

In Almaty, a city-scale quarantine came into force on March 19, 2020, which was a week after the first COVID-19 case was registered in Kazakhstan. This study aims to analyze the effect of the lockdown from March 19 to April 14, 2020 (27 days), on the concentrations of air pollutants in Almaty. Daily concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, and BTEX were compared between the periods before and during the lockdown. During the lockdown, the PM2.5 concentration was reduced by 21% with spatial variations of 6-34% compared to the average on the same days in 2018-2019, and still, it exceeded WHO daily limit values for 18 days. There were also substantial reductions in CO and NO2 concentrations by 49% and 35%, respectively, but an increase in O3 levels by 15% compared to the prior 17 days before the lockdown. The concentrations of benzene and toluene were 2-3 times higher than those during in the same seasons of 2015-2019. The temporal reductions may not be directly attributed to the lockdown due to favorable meteorological variations during the period, but the spatial effects of the quarantine on the pollution levels are evidenced. The results demonstrate the impact of traffic on the complex nature of air pollution in Almaty, which is substantially contributed by various nontraffic related sources, mainly coal-fired combined heat and power plants and household heating systems, as well as possible small irregular sources such as garbage burning and bathhouses.","Kerimray, Aiymgul; Baimatova, Nassiba; Ibragimova, Olga P; Bukenov, Bauyrzhan; Kenessov, Bulat; Plotitsyn, Pavel; Karaca, Ferhat",Sci Total Environ,206,16

During the first phase of COVID-19 outbreak, all blood donors were requested to report any respiratory infection symptoms after donation. The study investigated the callback data of COVID-19 in Tehran Blood Center during the first 3 months of the outbreak in Iran. The purpose of this study was to estimate the frequency of post donation COVID-19 related call back reports and determine its implications for blood donors and patients. A telephone interview was conducted with donors who had reported COVID-19 symptoms. Some questions were asked to evaluate donor's health at the time of blood donation. The donors categorized into three groups: laboratory-confirmed, suspected, and COVID-19 irrelevant based on their answers. In cases that the blood component obtained from a laboratory-confirmed donor had been released, the hospital was notified and asked to follow up the recipient for COVID-19. The results showed 30 donors (0.08 %) had callback related to COVID-19 and 76.63 % of the obtained component was disposed. The results also showed that only one donor had a laboratory-confirmed result with the RBC unit processed from her whole blood released for transfusion. The RBC unit recipient did not show any signs or symptoms of infection during a 46-day follow-up. Concluded that callback system was effective to remove most of the components obtained from the donors who reported to be COVID-19 suspected or confirmed. Moreover, the result did not support virus transmission through blood transfusion.","Balagholi, Sahar; Maghsudlu, Mahtab; Amini-Kafiabad, Sedigheh; Nazemi, Amir Masoud; Sotoudeh Anvari, Maryam",Transfus Apher Sci,206,25

Here we demonstrate the capacity of a subunit vaccine, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain displayed on an I53-50 protein nanoparticle scaffold (hereafter designated RBD-NP), to stimulate robust and durable neutralizing-antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques. We evaluated five adjuvants including Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion; AS03, an &#945;-tocopherol-containing oil-in-water emulsion; AS37, a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist adsorbed to alum; CpG1018-alum, a TLR9 agonist formulated in alum; and alum. RBD-NP immunization with AS03, CpG1018-alum, AS37 or alum induced substantial neutralizing-antibody and CD4 T cell responses, and conferred protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pharynges, nares and bronchoalveolar lavage. The neutralizing-antibody response to live virus was maintained up to 180 days after vaccination with RBD-NP in AS03 (RBD-NP-AS03), and correlated with protection from infection. RBD-NP immunization cross-neutralized the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant efficiently but showed a reduced response against the B.1.351 variant. RBD-NP-AS03 produced a 4.5-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.351 whereas the group immunized with RBD-NP-AS37 produced a 16-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.351, suggesting differences in the breadth of the neutralizing-antibody response induced by these adjuvants. Furthermore, RBD-NP-AS03 was as immunogenic as a prefusion-stabilized spike immunogen (HexaPro) with AS03 adjuvant. These data highlight the efficacy of the adjuvanted RBD-NP vaccine in promoting protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and have led to phase I/II clinical trials of this vaccine (NCT04742738 and NCT04750343).","Arunachalam, Prabhu S; Walls, Alexandra C; Golden, Nadia; Atyeo, Caroline; Fischinger, Stephanie; Li, Chunfeng; Aye, Pyone; Navarro, Mary Jane; Lai, Lilin; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Röltgen, Katharina; Rogers, Kenneth; Shirreff, Lisa; Ferrell, Douglas E; Wrenn, Samuel; Pettie, Deleah; Kraft, John C; Miranda, Marcos C; Kepl, Elizabeth; Sydeman, Claire; Brunette, Natalie; Murphy, Michael; Fiala, Brooke; Carter, Lauren; White, Alexander G; Trisal, Meera; Hsieh, Ching-Lin; Russell-Lodrigue, Kasi; Monjure, Christopher; Dufour, Jason; Spencer, Skye; Doyle-Meyers, Lara; Bohm, Rudolph P; Maness, Nicholas J; Roy, Chad; Plante, Jessica A; Plante, Kenneth S; Zhu, Alex; Gorman, Matthew J; Shin, Sally; Shen, Xiaoying; Fontenot, Jane; Gupta, Shakti; O039,; Hagan, Derek T; Van Der Most, Robbert; Rappuoli, Rino; Coffman, Robert L; Novack, David; McLellan, Jason S; Subramaniam, Shankar",Nature,206,1

Dermatologists and immunologists have to choose appropriate treatment strategy taking into consideration the risk of infection and possible exacerbation of the course of the disease in patients with confirmed infection. Management of atopic dermatitis (AD) in moderate to severe cases is based on systemic therapy such as cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate and dupilumab.Areas covered: A literature search in PubMed database was performed until 6 March 2021. In this review, the authors discuss non-biologic and biologic systemic medications for AD and provide an overview of therapeutic recommendations during COVID-19 pandemic.Expert opinion: In case of an active COVID-19 infection, conventional systemic treatment and biological treatment needs to be stopped until clinical recovery. Noninfected patients with systemic treatment of AD should continue their therapy via self-application. The authors can conclude that understanding of dupilumab therapy is better recognized in context AD treatment during COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to cyclosporine, azathioprine and methotrexate. However, this systemic immunosuppressants still require further investigation and literature complementation.","Marko, Monika; Pawliczak, Rafal",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,206,1

Demographic and clinical information on all the cases along with exposure and contact information were collected using a standardized case report form. In suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, respiratory specimens were collected and tested by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. The dynamic of the outbreak was summarized using epidemiological curves, instantaneous reproduction number Rt, and interactive choropleth maps for geographical distribution and spread. The rate of hospitalization was 14.0%(790/5646) in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBH) and 6.2% (267/4299) in the Republic of Srpska (RS). The death rate was 2.2% (122/5646) in FBH and 3.6% in the RS (155/4299). After the authorities lifted mandatory quarantine restrictions, the instantaneous reproduction number increased from 1.13 on May 20th to 1.72 on May 31st. The outbreak concerns both entities, FBH and RS, and it is more pronounced in those aged 20-44 years.

We then present BeCAPTCHA-Mouse, a bot detector based on neuromotor modeling of mouse dynamics that enhances traditional CAPTCHA methods. Our proposed bot detector is trained using both human and bot data generated by two new methods developed for generating realistic synthetic mouse trajectories: i) a knowledge-based method based on heuristic functions, and ii) a data-driven method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in which a Generator synthesizes human-like trajectories from a Gaussian noise input. Experiments are conducted on a new testbed also introduced here and available in GitHub: BeCAPTCHA-Mouse Benchmark; useful for research in bot detection and other mouse-based HCI applications. Our benchmark data consists of 10,000 mouse trajectories including real data from 58 users and bot data with various levels of realism. Our experiments show that BeCAPTCHA-Mouse is able to detect bot trajectories of high realism with 93% of accuracy in average using only one mouse trajectory.

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF&#945;. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.

The model assumes demographic (age related) categories, and is otherwise homogeneous. Maximum capacity for vaccination is exogenous and the authorities select its allocation to the categories. They can also adopt measures to uniformly diminish the contact rate between infected and susceptible individuals at an economic cost. Total or partial immunity is modeled, while the contact rate is allowed to exhibit seasonality. We apply optimal control methods to minimize a cost index while guaranteeing that health system capacity is not exceeded. A reasonable parameter selection leads to policies specifying that vaccination priority should be given to the category with a higher demand for the limited health care resources regardless of cost variations among categories. Vaccination priority reverses if some demographic category has significantly higher mobility while for some parameter values vaccination alternates among categories. Optimal social distancing policies exhibit seasonality, and hence reducing susceptibles below the average spontaneous disease extinction level does not necessarily lead to a repeal of social distancing.","Magirou, Evangelos F.",,206,1

It is unknown whether deprivation mediates this excess ethnic risk. METHODS: We used UK Biobank with linked COVID-19 outcomes occurring between 16th March 2020 and 24th August 2020. A four-way decomposition mediation analysis was used to model the extent to which the excess risk of testing positive, severe disease and mortality for COVID-19 in South Asian and black individuals, relative to white individuals, would be eliminated if levels of high material deprivation were reduced within the population. RESULTS: We included 15 044 (53.0% women) South Asian and black and 392 786 (55.2% women) white individuals. There were 151 (1.0%) positive tests, 91 (0.6%) severe cases and 31 (0.2%) deaths due to COVID-19 in South Asian and black individuals compared with 1471 (0.4%), 895 (0.2%) and 313 (0.1%), respectively, in white individuals. Compared with white individuals, the relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19, developing severe disease and COVID-19 mortality in South Asian and black individuals were 2.73 (95% CI: 2.26, 3.19), 2.96 (2.31, 3.61) and 4.04 (2.54, 5.55), respectively. A hypothetical intervention moving the 25% most deprived in the population out of deprivation was modelled to eliminate between 40 and 50% of the excess risk of all COVID-19 outcomes in South Asian and black populations, whereas moving the 50% most deprived out of deprivation would eliminate over 80% of the excess risk of COVID-19 outcomes.

Objective To explore the relationship between emotional responses and coping strategies used to face the first confinement among the Mexican adult population and inquire about differences by sex. Method An exploratory study was conducted through a self-administered online survey. It included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, emotions about pandemic information, and coping strategies. An informed consent form was presented prior to data collection. Chi square and Kruskal-Wallis were performed for bivariate analyses. Results A total of 2,650 participants completed the survey (21.6% were men). Significantly more men than women reported feeling calm (p &lt; .001), hopeful (p = .011), and indifferent (p = .002). In contrast, more women, compared to men significantly reported feeling worried (p &lt; .001), fearful (p &lt; 0.001), and sad (p &lt; .001). More women reported being emotionally close to other people (p = .027), seeking help from friends and family to share emotions and concerns (p &lt; .001), and they frequently prayed as a coping strategy regardless of their emotions (p = .005). Discussion and conclusion While women are the least affected by the contagion and their symptoms are milder than in men, they present the most negative emotions, particularly of worry, but they also used more caring and helpful behaviors in comparison with men. These results can serve as a basis for developing research with a gender perspective that delves into the differences by sex found in this study.","Ramos-Lira, Luciana; Rafful, Claudia; Flores-Celis, Karla; Mora Ríos, Jazmín; García-Andrade, Consuelo; Rascón Gasca, María Luisa; Bautista Aguilar, Natalia; Cervantes Muñoz, Consuelo",Salud ment,206,26

As vaccine hesitancy occurs along multiple dimensions, we used a social-ecological framework to guide the examination of COVID-19 vaccine intentions. METHODS: Using an online survey in the US conducted in July 2020, we examined intentions to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, once available. 592 respondents provided data, including measures of demographics, vaccine history, social norms, perceived risk, and trust in sources of COVID-19 information. Bivariate and multivariate multinomial models were used to compare respondents who intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to respondents who did not intend or were ambivalent about COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Only 59.1% of the sample reported that they intended to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine. In the multivariate multinomial model, those respondents who did not intend to be vaccinated, as compared to those who did, had significantly lower levels of trust in the CDC as a source of COVID-19 information (aOR = 0.29, CI = 0.17-0.50), reported lower social norms of COVID-19 preventive behaviors (aOR = 0.67, CI 0.51-0.88), scored higher on COVID-19 Skepticism (aOR = 1.44, CI = 1.28-1.61), identified as more politically conservative (aOR = 1.23, CI = 1.05-1.45), were less likely to have obtained a flu vaccine in the prior year (aOR = 0.21, CI = 0.11-0.39), were less likely to be female (aOR = 0.51, CI = 0.29-0.87), and were much more likely to be Black compared to White (aOR = 10.70, CI = 4.09-28.1). A highly similar pattern was observed among those who were ambivalent about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine compared to those who intended to receive one. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest several avenues for COVID-19 vaccine promotion campaigns, including social network diffusion strategies and cross-partisan messaging, to promote vaccine trust. The racial and gender differences in vaccine intentions also suggest the need to tailor campaigns based on gender and race.","Latkin, Carl; Dayton, Lauren A; Yi, Grace; Konstantopoulos, Arianna; Park, Ju; Maulsby, Catherine; Kong, Xiangrong",Vaccine,206,9

Patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD), particularly cirrhosis, hepatobiliary malignancies, candidates for liver transplantation, and immunosuppressed individuals after liver transplantation appear to be at increased risk of infections in general, which in turn translates into increased mortality. This is also the case for SARS-CoV-2 infection, where patients with cirrhosis, in particular, are at high risk of a severe COVID-19 course. Therefore, vaccination against various pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, administered as early as possible in patients with CLD, is an important protective measure. However, due to impaired immune responses in these patients, the immediate and long-term protective response through immunisation may be incomplete. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to the exceptionally fast development of several vaccine candidates. A small number of these SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates have already undergone phase III, placebo-controlled, clinical trials in healthy individuals with proof of short-term safety, immunogenicity and efficacy. However, although regulatory agencies in the US and Europe have already approved some of these vaccines for clinical use, information on immunogenicity, duration of protection and long-term safety in patients with CLD, cirrhosis, hepatobiliary cancer and liver transplant recipients has yet to be generated. This review summarises the data on vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in this patient population in general and discusses the implications of this knowledge on the introduction of the new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Cornberg, Markus; Buti, Maria; Eberhardt, Christiane S; Grossi, Paolo Antonio; Shouval, Daniel",J Hepatol,206,10

PURPOSE: Members of the Certified Wound and Ostomy Nurse, Nurse Practitioners staff were charged with developing recommendations within 48 hours to help prevent and manage facial skin issues using available products that would not compromise the seal of the respirators. METHOD: With the assistance of a health care safety specialist from the Environmental Health and Safety Department of the hospital, an ambient particle counting device was used to measure the N95 fit factor following application of a liquid skin barrier, transparent film dressing, light silicone-based adhesive dressing, or an extra-thin hydrocolloid dressing on the bridge of the nose and the cheekbones underneath an N95 respirator of 2 hospital staff members who volunteered to test the dressings. RESULTS: All thin dressings tested showed a fit factor over 100, reflecting an effective seal. The highest fit factors were seen with the liquid skin barrier in the 2 volunteers (200 and 198, respectively). Thin dressing usage information was included in the hospital guidelines for N95 respirators and shared with staff. Subsequent feedback suggests that the light silicone-based adhesive dressing and the extra-thin hydrocolloid dressing were preferred. CONCLUSION: Thin dressing use may help reduce skin complications among hospital staff during periods of extended N95 respirator wear time. Because use of the dressings did not result in failure of the quantitative fit test, they were permitted for use by health care staff under their N95 respirators. Studies are needed to help health care facilities optimize N95 respirator use to protect staff from coronavirus disease-19 and respirator-related skin complications while supply shortages remain.","Guschel, Susan; Chmiel, Karen; Rosenstein, Jennifer",Wound Manag Prev,206,12

Few studies have described the nursing care provided to patients in isolation between suspicion of having the disease and a confirmed diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to describe the treatment of, and nursing care processes for, patients suspected, but not yet confirmed, of having coronavirus disease at 1 facility in Shanghai, China. METHODS: For this retrospective facility case review and patient health record study, data were collected on all patients with suspected coronavirus disease who were treated between January 22, 2020, and February 29, 2020, at 1 hospital. The facility's nursing care processes were described in detail. RESULTS: A total of 119 patients were suspected of having coronavirus disease on the basis of the screening criteria. Nine (7.6%) patients had confirmed coronavirus disease and were transferred to a higher level of care. The remaining 110 (92.4%) were treated and discharged. No cross-infection between patients and hospital staff or other patients was detected. The patients' symptoms included fever (n = 98, 82.4%), cough (n = 79, 66.4%), dizziness (n = 28, 23.5%), headache (n = 26, 21.8%), fatigue (n = 26, 21.8%), myalgia (n = 16, 13.4%), rhinorrhea (n = 6, 5.0%), diarrhea (n = 5, 4.2%), severe nasal congestion (n = 4, 3.4%), and dyspnea (n = 1, 0.8%). DISCUSSION: Coronavirus disease is very contagious.

A 23-year-old African American man was admitted with a 1-week history of worsening fatigue, myalgias, headache, and dyspnea. Nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative by polymerase chain reaction; however, the patient was febrile and had leukocytosis, elevated troponin I, transaminitis, and acute kidney injury. Bedside echocardiogram showed decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (40% to 45%) and global hypokinesis in the setting of a type II non-ST segment myocardial infarction. Despite being on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, the patient's clinical condition continued to worsen. The patient was then empirically treated for MIS with intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone, which led to a rapid resolution of fever and laboratory abnormalities. This case highlights that MIS associated with COVID-19 may present in patients above the age of 21 years and can occur with a delayed onset after mild illness in those with no previous oxygen requirement or hospitalization during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Razavi, Alexander C; Chang, Jonathan L; Sutherland, Aimee; Niyogi, Anjali; Ménard, Geraldine E",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,206,6

Despite being essential to slow down the COVID-19 pandemic, these containment measures are associated with an economic burden. In this work, we propose a network approach to model the implementation of a partial lockdown, breaking the society into disconnected components, or partitions. Our model is composed by two main ingredients: a multiplex network representing human contacts within different contexts, formed by a Household layer, a Work layer, and a third Social layer including generic social interactions, and a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered process that mimics the epidemic spreading. We compare different partition strategies, with a twofold aim: reducing the epidemic outbreak and minimizing the economic cost associated to the partial lockdown. We also show that the inclusion of unconstrained social interactions dramatically increases the epidemic spreading, while different kinds of restrictions on social interactions help in keeping the benefices of the network partition.","Plazas, Adria; Malvestio, Irene; Starnini, Michele; D'iaz-Guilera, Albert",,206,1

Here, we fill this gap by developing a country distance approach to capture the pandemic’s propagation backbone tree from a complex airline network with multiple and evolving outbreak locations. We apply this approach, which is analogous to the effective resistance in series and parallel circuits, to examine countries’ closeness regarding disease spreading and evaluate the effectiveness of travel restrictions on delaying infections. In particular, we find that 63.2% of travel restrictions implemented as of 1 June 2020 are ineffective. The remaining percentage postponed the disease arrival time by 18.56 days per geographical area and resulted in a total reduction of 13,186,045 infected cases. Our approach enables us to design optimized and coordinated travel restrictions to extend the delay in arrival time and further reduce more infected cases while preserving air travel. © 2021, The Author(s).","Zhong, L.; Diagne, M.; Wang, W.; Gao, J.",Communications Physics,206,3

Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) is a relatively novel area of research and development in healthcare systems. However, it has multiple constraints and challenges regarding human health, social interactions, coverage radius, energy consumption, and communication reliability. In addition, communications between nodes can contain highly sensitive personal information, while hostile environments will impose a wide range of security risks. Therefore, designing authenticated key agreement (AKA) protocols is a crucial challenge in these networks. The current study, considering the security issues of the Li et al. scheme and some of their new extensions, proposes an improved AKA protocol with anonymity and unlinkability of the sensor node sessions. The results of theoretical analysis compared with similar schemes indicated that the proposed scheme could reduce average energy consumption and communication cost by 41 percent. It also reduced the average computation time by 61 percent. Furthermore, it was shown by formal/informal analyses that, on top of unlinkability and anonymity features, other central security features in the current scheme were similar and comparable to those in the recent and similar schemes.

DESIGN: Rapid systematic review. PARTICIPANTS: Humans with viral respiratory infections, exposed to systemic NSAIDs. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Acute severe adverse outcomes, healthcare utilisation, quality of life and long-term survival. RESULTS: We screened 10 999 titles and abstracts and 738 full texts, including 87 studies. No studies addressed COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; none examined inpatient healthcare utilisation, quality of life or long-term survival. Effects of NSAIDs on mortality and cardiovascular events in adults with viral respiratory infections are unclear (three observational studies; very low certainty). Children with empyema and gastrointestinal bleeding may be more likely to have taken NSAIDs than children without these conditions (two observational studies; very low certainty). In patients aged 3 years and older with acute respiratory infections, ibuprofen is associated with a higher rate of reconsultations with general practitioners than paracetamol (one randomised controlled trial (RCT); low certainty). The difference in death from all causes and hospitalisation for renal failure and anaphylaxis between children with fever receiving ibuprofen versus paracetamol is likely to be less than 1 per 10 000 (1 RCT; moderate/high certainty). Twenty-eight studies in adults and 42 studies in children report adverse event counts. Most report that no severe adverse events occurred. Due to methodological limitations of adverse event counts, this evidence should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: It is unclear whether the use of NSAIDs increases the risk of severe adverse outcomes in patients with viral respiratory infections. This absence of evidence should not be interpreted as evidence for the absence of such risk. This is a rapid review with a number of limitations.

The present study is aimed at systematically characterizing the circRNA expression profiles in patients with senile osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) and predicting the potential functions of the regulatory networks correlated with these differentially expressed circRNAs. Methods: The circRNA expression profile in patients with senile OVCF was explored by using RNA sequencing. The prediction of the enriched signaling pathways and circRNA-miRNA networks was conducted by bioinformatics analysis. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to validate the selected differentially expressed circRNAs from 20 patients with senile OVCF relative to 20 matched healthy controls. Results: A total of 884 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified, of which 554 were upregulated and 330 were downregulated. The top 15 signaling pathways associated with these differentially expressed circRNAs were predicted. The result of qRT-PCR of the selected circRNAs was consistent with RNA sequencing. Conclusions: CircRNAs are differentially expressed in patients with senile OVCF, which might contribute to the pathophysiological mechanism of senile osteoporosis.","Yao, Xiaocong; Liu, Minbo; Jin, Fang; Zhu, Zhongxin",Biomed Res Int,206,17

In this study, we aimed to explore the HRIs' types and patient characteristics among a sample taken from various representative in-field points in the Hajj season. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2018 at 80 data collection points distributed in the field. Data related to demographics, features and risk factors were collected and analyzed from all encountered cases with suspected HRIs. Moreover, we developed a diagnostic tree for HRIs by using the XGBoost model. Out of the 1200 persons encountered during the study period, 231 fulfilled the criteria of HRIs spectrum and were included in this study. Around 6% had HS and 20% had HE. All HS cases (100%) were from outside of Saudi Arabia as compared with 72.5% diagnosed with HE (27.5% were from Saudi Arabia). In addition, 16% were considered as heat-induced muscle spasms, and 7% had limb heat edema. Additionally, most of HRIs cases were reported between 11 am and 1 pm. The HRIs diagnostic tree model gave a diagnostic accuracy of 93.6%. This study highlights the magnitude of HRIs among pilgrims in Hajj and provides a diagnostic tree that can aid in the risk stratification and diagnosis of these patients. We advise the implementation of more educational campaigns to pilgrims regarding preventable measures especially for the vulnerable groups (e.g. from outside Saudi Arabia, those with comorbidities and light-skinned people).","Alkassas, Wesam; Rajab, Ahmad Mamoun; Alrashood, Sara T; Khan, Muhammad Ayub; Dibas, Mahmoud; Zaman, Mohsin",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,206,26

METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 pilot trial at nine UK sites. Adults aged 18 years or older and admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, with a positive RT-PCR or point-of-care test, or both, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive SNG001 (6 MIU) or placebo by inhalation via a mouthpiece daily for 14 days. The primary outcome was the change in clinical condition on the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) during the dosing period in the intention-to-treat population (all randomised patients who received at least one dose of the study drug). The OSCI is a 9-point scale, where 0 corresponds to no infection and 8 corresponds to death. Multiple analyses were done to identify the most suitable statistical method for future clinical trials.

However, RT-PCR has its limitations;this includes issues of low sensitivity, sampling errors and appropriate timing of specimen collection. As pulmonary involvement is the most common manifestation of severe COVID-19, early and appropriate lung imaging is important to aid diagnosis. However, gross discrepancies can occur between the clinical and imaging findings in patients with COVID-19, which can mislead clinicians in their decision making. Although chest X-ray (CXR) has a low sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated lung disease, especially in the earlier stages, a positive CXR increases the pre-test probability of COVID-19. CXR scoring systems have shown to be useful, such as the COVID-19 opacification rating score which helps to predict the need of tracheal intubation. Furthermore, artificial intelligence-based algorithms have also shown promise in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia on CXR from other lung diseases. Although costlier than CXR, unenhanced computed tomographic (CT) chest scans have a higher sensitivity, but lesser specificity compared to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. A semi-quantitative CT scoring system has been shown to predict short-term mortality. The routine use of CT pulmonary angiography as a first-line imaging modality in patients with suspected COVID-19 is not justifiable due to the risk of contrast nephropathy. Scoring systems similar to those pioneered in CXR and CT can be used to effectively plan and manage hospital resources such as ventilators. Lung ultrasound is useful in the assessment of critically ill COVID-19 patients in the hands of an experienced operator. Moreover, it is a convenient tool to monitor disease progression, as it is cheap, non-invasive, easily accessible and easy to sterilise. Newer lung imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for safe imaging among children, adolescents and pregnant women are rapidly evolving. Imaging modalities are also essential for evaluating the extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19: these include cranial imaging with CT or MRI;cardiac imaging with ultrasonography (US), CT and MRI;and abdominal imaging with US or CT. This review critically analyses the utility of each imaging modality to empower clinicians to use them appropriately in the management of patients with COVID-19 infection.","Kumar, H.; Fernandez, C.

It results in job loss on the one hand and less wages, increased working hours, overqualified employees and part time jobs on the other hand. Low demand of labour and a huge availability of work force will put many in a disadvantageous position, where they will have to compromise with the circumstances by being underemployed. Cabinet decisions, by some Indian states like Uttar Pradesh, to suspend the labour laws related to minimum wage, bonus, working hours and other employee benefits will put workers in a highly disadvantageous position of being underemployed. This may lead to many socio-economic, psychological and health-related implications. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review on the concept of underemployment, its types and consequences. METHODOLOGY: A critical and constructive analysis of the literature was performed. RESULTS: The findings reveal that if employment does not provide workers with proper opportunities to use their education, time, skills and expertise, it can create stressful situations in workers' lives.

Lacking medical prophylactic measures to combat disease spread, many nations have adopted social distancing policies in order to mitigate transmission of CoV-2. While mathematical models have suggested the efficacy of social distancing to curb the spread of CoV-2, there is a lack of systematic studies to quantify the real-world efficacy of these approaches. Here, we first demonstrate that implementation of social distancing policies in US states corresponded with a reduction in COVID19 spread rates, and that the reduction in spread rate is proportional to the average change in mobility. We validate this observation on a worldwide scale by analyzing COVID19 spread rate in 134 nations with varying social distancing policies. Globally, we find that social distancing policies significantly reduced the COVID19 spread rate, with resulting in an estimated 65% reduction (95% CI = 39-80%) in new COVID19 cases over a two week time period. These data suggest that social distancing policies may be a powerful tool to prevent spread of COVID19 in real-world scenarios.","McGrail, Daniel J; Dai, Jianli; McAndrews, Kathleen M; Kalluri, Raghu",PLoS One,206,5

We hypothesised that sensory processing, in particular pain, differs in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic AF. METHODS: Thirty individuals with permanent AF (15 symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic) completed the Atrial Fibrillation 6 (AF6) and short form 36 Health Survey questionnaires and underwent quantitative pain sensitisation testing using pressure algometry at the sternum (referred pain area) and the tibialis anterior muscle (generalised pain area). The primary objective was to assess differences in pressure pain thresholds (PPT), temporal summation of pain (TSP) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) in the two groups. The secondary objective was to determine association of demographic and clinical parameters to measures of pain sensitisation. RESULTS: The symptomatic group had lower PPTs at both tibialis (p=0.004) and sternum (p=0.01), and impaired CPM (p=0.025) and facilitated TSP (p=0.008) at the tibialis but not sternum, compared with the asymptomatic group. The AF6 sum score was negatively correlated to PPT on both tibialis (r=-0.50, p=0.005) and sternum (r=-0.42, p=0.02) and positively correlated to TSP on both tibialis (r=0.57, p=0.001) and sternum (r=0.45, p=0.01), but not to CPM.

To try and mitigate this disruption, the psychiatry undergraduate teaching faculty developed a knowledge based remote curriculum. However, it became clear that our students sorely missed clinical and consultation experience. Prior to the pandemic we had delivered a mock Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) to those undertaking their psychiatry block. In Somerset Academy, we wanted to deliver a distanced alternative: the remote mock OSCE (ReMO). We hoped to demonstrate this would be a feasible and valuable learning experience.MethodIn keeping with other OSCEs, ReMO had active stations (4) and a rest station. Four simultaneous Skype meetings were set up as clinical stations, each with an examiner and actor. To test the technology, students and facilitators were emailed links to each meeting in advance, and invited to sign in. Students were given individualised timings to rotate between stations. Stations involved history taking, risk assessment, and management discussions of common psychiatric presentations.The students then rotated again, receiving personalised feedback about their performance, enabling immediate reflection and consideration of areas for development. This was followed up with written feedback, using examiner completed mark schemes.ResultAfter ReMO we invited feedback from medical students and facilitators. 7 out of the 8 medical students that participated completed a post-ReMO survey. 100% of students found ReMO “useful”, with 71% (5/7) rating it an “extremely valuable” experience and 29% (2/7) rating it “fairly valuable”. Students felt it was well organised, realistic, and increased their confidence in remote consultations and OSCE practice. 6 out of 8 facilitators completed feedback on ReMO. 100% felt that ReMO was reproducible and 83% (5/6) rated it as “fairly realistic” when compared to the face-to-face standard.ConclusionFirstly, ReMO was feasible. However, it was logistically difficult, requiring extensive organisation to ensure this relatively small group were in the right place at the right time. In future, we would consider alternative platforms such as Zoom, or specific consultation software, such as Attend Anywhere, to reduce the logistics burden and utilise features such as ‘breakout rooms’. We would recommend an allocated co-ordinator to troubleshoot any problems in real time via a group messaging service.In conclusion, ReMO is achievable and a valuable student learning experience. Since the pilot it has become an integral part of our curriculum. We recommend that all undergraduate Psychiatry faculties consider adding it to their programme.","Brown, Rachel Brew-Girard Elsa De Souza Stephen",BJPsych Open,206,20

Using an adapted 36-hour community health worker (CHW) curriculum, we trained 42 lay community residents in New Orleans, Louisiana, neighborhoods experiencing disparities in leadership and advocacy skills to address SDOH. Six months posttraining, 29 participants completed a follow-up survey and interview. Participants described increases in knowledge, self-efficacy, and activities related to leadership and advocacy at all levels of the social ecological model. We also found a significant increase in communicating with Louisiana state senators or representatives (p < .0339). Our findings show that an adapted CHW training curriculum focused on SDOH, leadership, and advocacy can be used to train lay community residents in how to make changes in the community conditions that affect health and prompt new engagement to address SDOH at all levels of the social ecological model. Future efforts to increase lay community participation in addressing SDOH may benefit from providing ongoing support to participants such as organizing meetings with residents interested in similar topics, offering opportunities to ""shadow"" experienced CHWs, or hosting additional skills building workshops.","Wennerstrom, Ashley; Silver, Julia; Pollock, Miranda; Gustat, Jeanette",Health Promot Pract,206,23

With cruise tourism halted as a result of the COVID-19, but likely to resume in 2021, I question the relevance of this form of tourism and propose future development alternatives aligned with deglobalisation and degrowth of the industry. Power relations with destinations communities can be critiqued using the concepts of global mobility and local mobility to show that the former, imperative for the deployment of mass cruise tourism, is a weakness for the industry in a post-pandemic perspective of reduced mobility. Destinations must use the industry’s dependence on global mobility as leverage to transform the balance of power in their favor and promote local mobility. They must embrace radical solutions to take control of their territory to favor a transition from “Growth for development” to “Degrowth for liveability”. Host territories, relying on national and regional governance, should gradually ban or restrict the arrival of mega-cruise ships, implement policies that promote the development of a niche cruise tourism industry (NCTI) with small ships and develop a fleet controlled by local actors.","Renaud, Luc",Tour.

It is unknown the immediate impact of social restriction recommendations (i.e., lockdown, stay-at-home) on the life-space mobility of older people. Objective: To investigate the immediate impact of COVID-19 pandemic on life-space mobility of community-dwelling Brazilian older adults and examine the social determinants of health associated with change in life-space mobility. Design: Baseline data from a prospective cohort study (REMOBILIZE Study). Setting: Community. Subject: A convenience snowball sample of participants aged 60 and older (n = 1,482) living in 22 states in Brazil. Methods: We conducted an online and phone survey using an adapted version of the Life-Space Assessment (LSA). Linear regression models were used to investigate social determinants of health on the change in LSA score. Results: Regardless of their gender and social determinants of health, participants showed a significant reduction in life-space mobility since COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Life-space mobility reduction was higher among black individuals, those living alone and aged between 70 and 79. Other variables associated with change in life-space mobility, to a lesser extent, were sex, education and income. Conclusion: Social restriction measures due to pandemic caused substantial reduction in older adults' life-space mobility in Brazil. Social inequalities strongly affected vulnerable groups. Concerted actions should be put in place to overcome the deterioration in life-pace mobility amongst these groups.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: The design was a matched case-control study. Severe COVID-19 was defined as either a positive nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the national database followed by entry to a critical care unit or death within 28 days or a death certificate with COVID-19 as underlying cause. Up to 10 controls per case matched for sex, age, and primary care practice were selected from the national population register. For this analysis-based on ascertainment of positive test results up to 6 June 2020, entry to critical care up to 14 June 2020, and deaths registered up to 14 June 2020-there were 36,948 controls and 4,272 cases, of which 1,894 (44%) were care home residents. All diagnostic codes from the past 5 years of hospitalisation records and all drug codes from prescriptions dispensed during the past 240 days were extracted. Rate ratios for severe COVID-19 were estimated by conditional logistic regression. In a logistic regression using the age-sex distribution of the national population, the odds ratios for severe disease were 2.87 for a 10-year increase in age and 1.63 for male sex. In the case-control analysis, the strongest risk factor was residence in a care home, with rate ratio 21.4 (95% CI 19.1-23.9, p = 8 × 10-644). Univariate rate ratios for conditions listed by public health agencies as conferring high risk were 2.75 (95% CI 1.96-3.88, p = 6 × 10-9) for type 1 diabetes, 1.60 (95% CI 1.48-1.74, p = 8 × 10-30) for type 2 diabetes, 1.49 (95% CI 1.37-1.61, p = 3 × 10-21) for ischemic heart disease, 2.23 (95% CI 2.08-2.39, p = 4 × 10-109) for other heart disease, 1.96 (95% CI 1.83-2.10, p = 2 × 10-78) for chronic lower respiratory tract disease, 4.06 (95% CI 3.15-5.23, p = 3 × 10-27) for chronic kidney disease, 5.4 (95% CI 4.9-5.8, p = 1 × 10-354) for neurological disease, 3.61 (95% CI 2.60-5.00, p = 2 × 10-14) for chronic liver disease, and 2.66 (95% CI 1.86-3.79, p = 7 × 10-8) for immune deficiency or suppression. Seventy-eight percent of cases and 52% of controls had at least one listed condition (51% of cases and 11% of controls under age 40). Severe disease was associated with encashment of at least one prescription in the past 9 months and with at least one hospital admission in the past 5 years (rate ratios 3.10 [95% CI 2.59-3.71] and 2.75 [95% CI 2.53-2.99], respectively) even after adjusting for the listed conditions. In those without listed conditions, significant associations with severe disease were seen across many hospital diagnoses and drug categories. Age and sex provided 2.58 bits of information for discrimination. A model based on demographic variables, listed conditions, hospital diagnoses, and prescriptions provided an additional 1.07 bits (C-statistic 0.804). A limitation of this study is that records from primary care were not available. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that, along with older age and male sex, severe COVID-19 is strongly associated with past medical history across all age groups. Many comorbidities beyond the risk conditions designated by public health agencies contribute to this. A risk classifier that uses all the information available in health records, rather than only a limited set of conditions, will more accurately discriminate between low-risk and high-risk individuals who may require shielding until the epidemic is over.","McKeigue, Paul M; Weir, Amanda; Bishop, Jen; McGurnaghan, Stuart J; Kennedy, Sharon; McAllister, David; Robertson, Chris; Wood, Rachael; Lone, Nazir; Murray, Janet; Caparrotta, Thomas M; Smith-Palmer, Alison; Goldberg, David; McMenamin, Jim; Ramsay, Colin; Hutchinson, Sharon; Colhoun, Helen M",PLoS Med,206,1

With only limited palliative care-specific literature and no time to set up and evaluate pilots, we had to get on and set up a prototype 'virtual visits' model, retro-fitting guidance and a supporting ethical framework. We looked at the issues spanning clinical, ethical and logistics domains; identifying areas of benefit as well as drawbacks, some specific to the rushed implementation because of COVID-19's infective risks and the 'rules' of lockdown, but many are generic areas to help guide longer term service design. Unsurprisingly, it appears clear that a 'one-size-fits-all' mentality is a poor fit for the individualised needs of the heterogeneous palliative care population. Virtual visits have great potential even if they are not a panacea.","Hawkins, Joseph Paul; Gannon, Craig; Palfrey, Jennifer",BMJ Support Palliat Care,206,23

Serious outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, have occurred throughout China and the world. Therefore, we intend to shed light on its potential clinical and epidemiological characteristics. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 50 confirmed fatal cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported on Chinese official media networks from January 16, 2020, to February 5, 2020. All the cases were confirmed by local qualified medical and health institutions. Specific information has been released through official channels. According to the contents of the reports, we recorded in detail the gender, age, first symptom date, death date, primary symptoms, chronic fundamental diseases, and other data of the patients, and carried out analyses and discussion. RESULTS: In total, 50 fatal cases were reported: median age was 70 y old, and males were 2.33 times more likely to die than females. The median number of days from the first symptom to death was 13, and that length of time tended to be shorter among people aged 65 and older compared with those younger than 65 (12 days vs 17 days; P = 0.046). Therefore, the older patients had fewer number of days from the first symptom to death (r = -0.40; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found that most of the deaths were elderly men with chronic fundamental diseases, and their COVID-19 progression to death time was shorter. At the same time, we demonstrated that older men are more likely to become infected with COVID-19, and the risk of death is positively correlated with age.","Chen, Yiguang; Li, Tianhua; Ye, Yongyi; Chen, Yongjian; Pan, Jun",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,206,21

Those studies were predominantly conducted under moderately to highly polluted outdoor atmospheres. The purpose of this study was to extend the data set to include a less polluted atmospheric environment. A relationship between PM2.5 and ILI activity extended to include lightly to moderately polluted atmospheres could imply a more complicated mechanism than that suggested by existing studies. We obtained concurrent PM2.5 mass concentration data, meteorological data and reported Influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) activity for the light to moderately polluted atmospheres over the Tucson, AZ region. We found no relation between PM2.5 mass concentration and ILI activity. There was an expected relation between ILI, activity, temperature, and relative humidity. There was a possible relation between PM2.5 mass concentration anomalies and ILI activity. These results might be due to the small dataset size and to the technological limitations of the PM measurements. Further study is recommended since it would improve the understanding of ILI transmission and thereby improve ILI activity/outbreak forecasts and transmission model accuracies.","DeFelice, T P",Heliyon,206,25

Metaphylactic administration of antimicrobial reduces colonization of respiratory tract by pathogens, but the development of antibiotic-resistance raises public health concerns leading to propose new control strategies. The study analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs of 231 imported cattle, 10% of 49 trucks, transported from France to southern Italy and, through Real-time PCR identified the prevalence of the involved pathogens speculating on strategies to reduce the impact of BRD. The samples were tested by Real-time PCR, for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis. Yates-corrected chi squared, or Fisher's exact test were used to compare both animal-health status and positivity/negativity to pathogens, and the relationship between presence/absence of clinical signs and Real-time PCR-positivity. H. somni and BCoV were the most frequently identified pathogens. In BRD-diagnosed cattle, BAdV was detected in 13.8% (19/138), BRSV in 14.5% (20/138) and BPiV in 4.3% (6/138). Healthy cattle were mostly positive for H. somni (89.2%, 83/93). A statistically significant association was observed between clinical signs and positivity to M. haemolytica (p value = 0.016). Although mass-medication and vaccination are used for BRD control, it still remains a primary health problem. Our results highlight that the nasopharyngeal microbiota could be affected by transport and that strategies to enhance calf immunity for reducing BRD-risk development would be more effective if applied at farm of origin prior to loading.","Pratelli, Annamaria; Cirone, Francesco; Capozza, Paolo; Trotta, Adriana; Corrente, Marialaura; Balestrieri, Anna; Buonavoglia, Canio",Res. vet. sci,206,1

Lung lesions are considered to be the main damage caused by SARSCoV-2 infection. In addition, liver injury has also been reported to occur during the course of the disease in severe cases. However, the effect of antiviral treatment on liver injury in critically ill patients is not yet clear. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the effect of antiviral treatment and antiviral drug arbidol on liver injury in COVID-19 critically ill patients. Baseline characteristics were collected from patients who were admitted to intensive care units of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, and confounders were balanced by propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analyses. RESULTS: Both the PSM (OR=2.77; 95% CI: 1.03, 7.48; P=0.045) and the IPTW-adjusted (OR=2.33; 95% CI: 1.02, 5.34; P=0.047) results showed that COVID-19 critically ill patients receiving antiviral treatment had a significantly higher risk of liver injury. However, arbidol treatment did not have a significant effect on liver injury (IPTW: OR=2.11; 95% CI: 0.79, 5.67; P=0.14). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that although arbidol treatment does not seem to be significantly associated with liver injury complications, the overall use of antiviral drugs increases the risk of liver injury for critically ill patients with COVID-19. Antiviral drugs are widely used to treat COVID-19, but we recommend that for critically ill patients, antiviral treatment should be used with caution considering both effectiveness and potential adverse effects.","Ruan, Xinjia; Lu, Xiaofan; Wang, Kangyi; Zhang, Bing; Wang, Jun; Li, Yongsheng; Wang, Jiashuo; Xu, Zhengbao; Yan, Fangrong",Ann. palliat. med.

Recent studies have reported that aberrant A-to-I RNA editing profiles are implicated in cancers. Albeit changes in expression and activity of ADAR genes are thought to have been responsible for the dysregulated RNA editome in diseases, they are not always correlated, indicating the involvement of secondary regulators. Here, we uncover DAP3 as a potent repressor of editing and a strong oncogene in cancer. DAP3 mainly interacts with the deaminase domain of ADAR2 and represses editing via disrupting association of ADAR2 with its target transcripts. PDZD7, an exemplary DAP3-repressed editing target, undergoes a protein recoding editing at stop codon [Stop âTrp (W)]. Because of editing suppression by DAP3, the unedited PDZD7WT, which is more tumorigenic than edited PDZD7Stop518W, is accumulated in tumors. In sum, cancer cells may acquire malignant properties for their survival advantage through suppressing RNA editome by DAP3.","Han, Jian; An, Omer; Hong, HuiQi; Chan, Tim Hon Man; Song, Yangyang; Shen, Haoqing; Tang, Sze Jing; Lin, Jaymie Siqi; Ng, Vanessa Hui En; Tay, Daryl Jin Tai; Molias, Fernando Bellido; Pitcheshwar, Priyankaa; Tan, Hui Qing; Yang, Henry; Chen, Leilei",Sci.

Securing water will require more work and time, burdening women and children the most. Currently, the consequences of this time burden to children's development remain understudied. To address this gap, we examine the tradeoff between children's household water collection responsibilities and learning achievement. Using nationally representative data from India, we measure the effect of daily fetching time on primary school children's learning achievement in a two-stage regression model, with rainfall as the instrument. Our analyses indicate that higher fetching times predict lower mathematics (-1.23 standard deviations, 95CI[-2.32, -0.14]), reading (-1.13 standard deviations, 95CI[-2.07, -0.19]), and writing (-1.21 standard deviations, 95CI[-1.89, -0.51]) test scores. These effects are heterogeneous across sex and infrastructure type. For example, we find girls' mathematical and reading skills profit more from reductions in fetching time than boys' (score less affected for boys by ß amount: mathematics: ß=0.26 points, 95CI[0.095, 0.42]; reading: ß=0.27 points, 95CI[0.054, 0.49]).

SARS-CoV-2 targets epithelial and endothelial cells through the ACE2 receptor. The anatomical involvement of the coronary tree is not explored yet. METHODS: Cardiac autopsy tissue of the entire coronary tree (main coronary arteries, epicardial arterioles/venules, epicardial capillaries) and epicardial nerves were analyzed in COVID-19 patients (n = 6). All anatomical regions were immunohistochemically tested for ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68 and IL-6. COVID-19 negative patients with cardiovascular disease (n = 3) and influenza A (n = 6) served as controls. FINDINGS: COVID-19 positive patients showed strong ACE2 / TMPRSS2 expression in capillaries and less in arterioles/venules. The main coronary arteries were virtually devoid of ACE2 receptor and had only mild intimal inflammation. Epicardial capillaries had a prominent lympho-monocytic endotheliitis, which was less pronounced in arterioles/venules. The lymphocytic-monocytic infiltrate strongly expressed CD4, CD45, CD68. Peri/epicardial nerves had strong ACE2 expression and lympho-monocytic inflammation. COVID-19 negative patients showed minimal vascular ACE2 expression and lacked endotheliitis or inflammatory reaction. INTERPRETATION: ACE2 / TMPRSS2 expression and lymphomonocytic inflammation in COVID-19 disease increases crescentically towards the small vessels suggesting that COVID-19-induced endotheliitis is a small vessel vasculitis not involving the main coronaries. The inflammatory neuropathy of epicardial nerves in COVID-19 disease provides further evidence of an angio- and neurotrophic affinity of SARS-COV2 and might potentially contribute to the understanding of the high prevalence of cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmias in COVID-19. FUNDING: No external funding was necessary for this study.","Maccio, Umberto; Zinkernagel, Annelies S; Shambat, Srikanth Mairpady; Zeng, Xiankun; Cathomas, Gieri; Ruschitzka, Frank; Schuepbach, Reto A; Moch, Holger; Varga, Zsuzsanna",EBioMedicine,206,24

Groups from China identified and sequenced the virus responsible for COVID-19, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and determined that it was a novel coronavirus sharing high sequence identity with bat- and pangolin-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, suggesting a zoonotic origin. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a broad range of vertebrates. The rapid release of the sequence of the virus has enabled the development of diagnostic tools. Additionally, serological tests can now identify individuals who have been infected. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a fatality rate of around 1-3%, which is commonly linked to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely resulting from uncontrolled immune activation, the so called ""cytokine storm"". Risk factors for mortality include advanced age, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Drug repurposing has been used to rapidly identify potential treatments for COVID-19, which could move quickly to phase III. Better knowledge of the virus and its enzymes will aid the development of more potent and specific direct-acting antivirals. In the long term, a vaccine to prevent infection is crucial; however, even if successful, it might not be available before 2021-22. To date, except for intravenous remdesivir and dexamethasone, which have modest effects in moderate to severe COVID-19, no strong clinical evidence supports the efficacy of any other drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review is to provide insights on the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, its virology, diagnostic tools, and the ongoing drug discovery effort.","Asselah, Tarik; Durantel, David; Pasmant, Eric; Lau, George; Schinazi, Raymond F",J Hepatol,206,16

This space is built so that observations are distributed linearly regarding how hard they are to classify. The user can visually interact with this embedding in multiple ways and obtain useful insights about data and algorithmic performance along the individual observations of the dataset.

Here, we reflect on the approach we used to establish a cardiac surgery unit in Trinidad and Tobago. METHODS: The program started in 1993 with monthly visits by a team from Bristol Heart Institute. A group of local doctors, nurses, and perfusionists were identified for training, and a senior nurse moved to the island to start a teaching program. The visiting support was gradually reduced, and the local team gained independence in managing the service in 2006. RESULTS: The initial low volume surgery increased to around 380 cases a year with the implementation of comprehensive service in 2006. Most patients required coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). In-hospital mortality declined from 5% in the nascent years to below 2% thereafter. In the last 5 years (2015-2019), 1764 patients underwent surgery (mean age 59.6 ± 10.8 years, 66% male). The majority were East-Indian-Caribbean (79.1%) or Afro-Caribbean (16.7%), half had diabetes, and two-thirds hypertension (EuroScore II 1.8 ± 1.9). The majority (1363 patients) underwent CABG (99.5% off-pump; conversion to on-pump 1.5%). The mean number of grafts was 2.5 ± 0.7 with 98.5% and 23.1% receiving one and two or more arterial grafts, respectively. In-hospital mortality was 1.1%, re-exploration for bleeding 2%, stroke 0.1%, mediastinitis 0.2%. The length of the postoperative hospital stay was 5.8 ± 2 days. CONCLUSION: Frequent outside visits complemented by training in an overseas center, and transfer of knowledge proved to be an effective strategy to develop a cardiac surgery unit in an emerging country with results comparable to accepted international standards.","Angelini, Gianni D; Ramsingh, Richard A E; Rahaman, Natasha C; Rampersad, Risshi D; Rampersad, Anand; Rampersad, Kamal A; Teodori, Giovanni",J. card. surg,206,2

Effective treatments and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 infection do not currently exist. Previous studies demonstrated that nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16) of coronavirus is an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent 2'-O-methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) that has an important role in viral replication and prevents recognition by the host innate immune system. In the present study, we employed structural analysis, virtual screening, and molecular simulation approaches to identify clinically investigated and approved drugs which can act as promising inhibitors against nsp16 2'-O-MTase of SARS-CoV-2. Comparative analysis of primary amino acid sequences and crystal structures of seven human CoVs defined the key residues for nsp16 2-O'-MTase functions. Virtual screening and docking analysis ranked the potential inhibitors of nsp16 from more than 4,500 clinically investigated and approved drugs. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on eight top candidates, including Hesperidin, Rimegepant, Gs-9667, and Sonedenoson, to calculate various structural parameters and understand the dynamic behavior of the drug-protein complexes.

To our knowledge, this is the first study that aimed to investigate the psychological distress among the adult general population across 13 countries. This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey by recruiting 7091 respondents. Psychological distress was evaluated with COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). The crude prevalence of psychological distress due to COVID-19 is highest in Vietnam, followed by Egypt, and Bangladesh. Through Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis, the respondents from Vietnam holds the highest level of distress, while the respondents from Sri Lanka holds the lowest level of distress with reference to Nepal.Female respondents had higher odds of having reported psychological distress, and those with tertiary education were less likely to report psychological distress compared to those with lower level of education. The findings indicate that psychological distress is varies across different countries. Therefore, different countries should continue the surveillance on psychological consequences through the COVID-19 pandemic to monitor the burden and to prepare for the targeted mental health support interventions according to the need. The coping strategies and social support should be provided especially to the lower educational attainment group.","Marzo, Roy Rillera; Ismail, Zaliha; Nu Htay, Mila Nu; Bahari, Rafidah; Ismail, Roshidi; Villanueva, Emilio Quilatan; Singh, Akansha; Lotfizadeh, Masoud; Respati, Titik; Irasanti, Siska Nia; Sartika, Dewi; Mong, Pham; Lekamwasam, Sarath; Thapa, Bikash Bikram; KUcuk Bicer, Burcu; Aye, Soe Soe; Songwathana, Karnjana; El-Abasiri, Radwa Abdullah; Ahmad, Amaluddin; Nikmat, AzlinaWati; Taheri Mirani, Seyedeh Zeinab; Mukti, Roushney Fatima; Mehnaz, Saira; Su, Tin Tin",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,206,1

This study aims to analyse and quantify the possible retinal microvascular abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case-control study. Patients between 18 and 55 years old with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within the last 3 months were included. Risk stratification: group 1-mild disease (asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic); group 2-moderate disease (required hospital admission with no acute respiratory distress) and group 3-severe disease (subjects who developed an acute respiratory distress were admitted in the intensive care unit and presented interleukin 6 values above 40 pg/mL). Age-matched volunteers with negative serology tests were enrolled to control group. A colour photograph, an optical coherence tomography (OCT) and an angiography using OCT centred on the fovea were performed. RESULTS: Control group included 27 subjects: group 1 included 24 patients, group 2 consisted of 24 patients and 21 participants were recruited for group 3. There were no funduscopic lesions, neither in the colour images nor in the structural OCT.

Excessive COVID-19-related information caused substantial mental distress among the public. Although most studies focused on the impact of information on individuals during the pandemic, they usually focused on information from internet sources, and few studies compared the impacts between different information sources. We examine the sociodemographic profiles of participants receiving different information sources and the impact of various COVID-19-related information sources on public worry. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey with a total of 2007 participants aged 20 years and above recruited anonymously was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sociodemographic data, frequencies at which participants received COVID-19-related information, the information sources (e.g., traditional media, interpersonal information exchange, and academic courses), and the levels of past, current, and anticipated worry about COVID-19 were assessed. Results: The most common sources of COVID-19-related information were internet media (80.52%), traditional media (52.62%), family members (24.36%), coworkers (23.57%), friends (21.08%), academic courses (20.18%), and medical staff (19.03%). We found that the COVID-19-related information from traditional media, internet media, and friends was associated with higher current worry (the unstandardized regression coefficient, B, ranged from 0.27 to 0.30), and the information from friends was associated with higher past worry (B was 0.18). In contrast, participants who received information from academic courses had lower past worry and anticipated worry (B ranged from -0.15 to -0.17). Conclusions: Academic courses may play a protective role in public worry during the pandemic. Therefore, academic courses and the information they provide may help facilitate public education and reduce public worry in cases of infectious disease outbreaks.","Ho, Hsing-Ying; Chen, Yi-Lung; Yen, Cheng-Fang",Internet Interv,206,20

Infection of CCxK18-hACE2 F1 progeny resulted in a spectrum of weight loss, survival, viral replication kinetics, histopathology, and cytokine profiles, some of which were sex-specific. Importantly, survival was closely associated with early type I interferon expression and a phased proinflammatory response distinct from mice with severe disease. Thus, dynamics of inflammatory responses observed in COVID-19 can be modeled in diverse mice that provide a genetically tractable platform for understanding antiviral immunity and evaluating countermeasures.","Robertson, Shelly; Bedard, Olivia; McNally, Kristin; Lewis, Matthew; Clancy, Chad; Shaia, Carl; Broeckel, Rebecca; Chiramel, Abhilash; Sturdevant, Gail; Forte, Elvira; Preuss, Christoph; Baker, Candice; Sturdevant, Daniel; Martens, Craig; Holland, Steven; Rosenthal, Nadia; Best, Sonja",,206,24

METHODS: UK users of the Zoe COVID-19 Symptom Study app provided baseline data including demographics, anthropometrics, smoking status and medical conditions, and were asked to log their condition daily. Participants who reported that they did not feel physically normal were then asked by the app to complete a series of questions, including 14 potential COVID-19 symptoms and about hospital attendance. The main study outcome was the development of 'classic' symptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic defined as fever, new persistent cough and breathlessness and their association with current smoking. The number of concurrent COVID-19 symptoms was used as a proxy for severity and the pattern of association between symptoms was also compared between smokers and non-smokers.

This change deeply impacted typical working routines, affecting both well-being and productivity. Moreover, this pandemic will have long-lasting effects in the software industry, with several tech companies allowing their employees to work from home indefinitely if they wish to do so. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze and understand how a typical working day looks like when working from home and how individual activities affect software developers' well-being and productivity. We performed a two-wave longitudinal study involving almost 200 globally carefully selected software professionals, inferring daily activities with perceived well-being, productivity, and other relevant psychological and social variables. Results suggest that the time software engineers spent doing specific activities from home was similar when working in the office. However, we also found some significant mean differences. The amount of time developers spent on each activity was unrelated to their well-being, perceived productivity, and other variables.

BACKGROUND: AAs have worse outcomes compared to whites while facing heart diseases, stroke, cancer, asthma, influenza and pneumonia, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS. However, there is no current study to show the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the AA communities. METHODS: This is a retrospective study that included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 tertiary centers in New Orleans, LA. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 157 patients were identified. Of these, 134 (77%) were AAs, whereas 23.4% of patients were Whites. Interestingly, AA were younger, with a mean age of 63 ± 13.4 compared to 75.7 ± 23 years in Whites (P < 0.001). Thirty-seven patients presented with no insurance, and 34 of them were AA. SOFA Score was significantly higher in AA (2.57 ± 2.1) compared to White patients (1.69 ± 1.7), P = 0.041. Elevated SOFA score was associated with higher odds for intubation (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.32-1.93, P < 0.001).

Accordingly, it is a vital process to detect positive cases at an early stage for treatment and controlling the disease from spreading. Several medical tests had been applied for COVID-19 detection in certain injuries, but with limited efficiency. In this study, a new COVID-19 diagnosis strategy called Feature Correlated Naïve Bayes (FCNB) has been introduced. The FCNB consists of four phases, which are; Feature Selection Phase (FSP), Feature Clustering Phase (FCP), Master Feature Weighting Phase (MFWP), and Feature Correlated Naïve Bayes Phase (FCNBP). The FSP selects only the most effective features among the extracted features from laboratory tests for both COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 people by using the Genetic Algorithm as a wrapper method. The FCP constructs many clusters of features based on the selected features from FSP by using a novel clustering technique. These clusters of features are called Master Features (MFs) in which each MF contains a set of dependent features. The MFWP assigns a weight value to each MF by using a new weight calculation method. The FCNBP is used to classify patients based on the weighted Naïve Bayes algorithm with many modifications as the correlation between features. The proposed FCNB strategy has been compared to recent competitive techniques. Experimental results have proven the effectiveness of the FCNB strategy in which it outperforms recent competitive techniques because it achieves the maximum (99%) detection accuracy.","Mansour, Nehal A; Saleh, Ahmed I; Badawy, Mahmoud; Ali, Hesham A",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,206,15

To better study volitional control at annotated neural population, we have developed an operant neuroprosthetic task with closed-loop feedback system by volitional conditioning of population calcium signal in the M1 cortex using fiber photometry recording. Importantly, volitional conditioning of the population calcium signal in M1 neurons did not improve within-session adaptation, but specifically enhanced across-session neuroprosthetic skill learning with reduced time-to-target and the time to complete 50 successful trials. With brain-behavior causality of the neuroprosthetic paradigm, we revealed that proficiency of neuroprosthetic learning by volitional conditioning of calcium signal was associated with the stable representational (plasticity) mapping in M1 neurons with the reduced calcium peak. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of adenosine A2A receptors facilitated volitional conditioning of neuroprosthetic learning and converted an ineffective volitional conditioning protocol to be the effective for neuroprosthetic learning. These findings may help to harness neuroplasticity for better volitional control of neuroprosthetic training and suggest a novel pharmacological strategy to improve neuroprosthetic learning in BMI adaptation by targeting striatal A2A receptors.","Zhang, Liping; Zhou, Yuling; Liu, Chengwei; Zheng, Wu; Yao, Zhimo; Wang, Qin; Jin, Yile; Zhang, Shaomin; Chen, Weidong; Chen, Jiang-Fan",Neuropharmacology,206,16

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent clinical trials suggested remdesivir, IFN-ß-1b and favipiravir have potential clinical and/or virological benefits on patients with COVID-19. Short course of stress dose of corticosteroids might be used as adjunctive treatment to patients who are late presenters with cytokine storm. Convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients with high neutralizing antibody might also be beneficial in the treatment of severe disease. SUMMARY: Early effective antiviral therapy in COVID-19 patients will suppress the SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Adjunctive therapy with corticosteroid and convalescent plasma might further ameliorate the cytokine response.

METHODS: An email survey combining short and open-ended questions was distributed to all 40 Korean school deans in May 2020. Thirty-seven deans out of 40 medical schools in Korea (92.5%) participated. RESULTS: Most lectures moved online but students' assessments were delayed and later held onsite. Clinical rotations continued except for an average of 3-week suspension during the first COVID-19 wave. The deans' remarks on the positive influences far outweighed the negative impact of COVID-19 on medical education. Although technological adaptations caused initial hardship, the experience gained through the use of various online learning systems led to attitudinal changes on the importance of adopting new technology and a tailored and student centric curriculum in medical education. CONCLUSION: The deans' perspective changes has shown the possibility of the deans' generation aligning more closely with the current Generation Z medical students. They projected further innovations in teaching and learning methods, especially applying flipped learning and highlighted the need to invest in faculty development so medical educators can be equipped and competent in diverse ICT (information and communications technology) learning platforms. Also, the need for advance preparations in medical education for future similar public health crises were stressed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a distributed, federated network of 12 health systems that harmonized their EHRs and submitted aggregate answers to consortia questions posted at https://www.covid19questions.org. Our consortium developed processes and implemented distributed algorithms to produce answers to a variety of questions. We were able to generate counts, descriptive statistics, and build a multivariate, iterative regression model without centralizing individual-level data. RESULTS: Our public website contains answers to various clinical questions, a web form for users to ask questions in natural language, and a list of items that are currently pending responses. The results show, for example, that patients who were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, within the year before admission, had lower unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates. We also showed that, when adjusted for, age, sex, and ethnicity were not significantly associated with mortality. We demonstrated that it is possible to answer questions about COVID-19 using EHR data from systems that have different policies and must follow various regulations, without moving data out of their health systems. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: We present an alternative or a complement to centralized COVID-19 registries of EHR data.

In this study, we analyzed 587 million tweets worldwide to see how global collaborative efforts in reducing human mobility are reflected from the user-generated information at the global, country, and the U.S. state scale. Considering the multifaceted nature of mobility, we propose two types of distance: the single-day distance and the cross-day distance. To quantify the responsiveness in certain geographical regions, we further propose a mobility-based responsive index (MRI) that captures the overall degree of mobility changes within a time window. The results suggest that mobility patterns obtained from Twitter data are amendable to quantitatively reflect the mobility dynamics. Globally, the proposed two distances had greatly deviated from their baselines after March 11, 2020, when WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The considerably less periodicity after the declaration suggests that the protection measures have obviously affected people's travel routines. The country scale comparisons reveal the discrepancies in responsiveness, evidenced by the contrasting mobility patterns in different epidemic phases. We find that the triggers of mobility changes correspond well with the national announcements of mitigation measures. In the U.S., the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility is distinct. However, the impacts varied substantially among states. The strong mobility recovering momentum is further fueled by the Black Lives Matter protests, potentially fostering the second wave of infections in the U.S.","Huang, Xiao; Li, Zhenlong; Jiang, Yuqin; Li, Xiaoming; Porter, Dwayne",,206,24

The vast majority of investigated 3CLpro inhibitors are organic, non-covalent binders. Herein, the use of inorganic, coordinate covalent binders is proposed that can attenuate the activity of the protease. ReI tricarbonyl complexes were identified that demonstrate coordinate covalent enzymatic inhibition of 3CLpro .

Unfortunately, additional clinically significant treatment options since the approval of remdesivir are scarce. To overcome the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) more efficiently, a treatment strategy that controls not only SARS-CoV-2 replication but also the host entry step should be considered. In this study, we used MT-DTI to predict FDA approved drugs that may have strong affinities for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which are essential for viral entry to the host cell. Of the 460 drugs with Kd of less than 100 nM for the ACE2 receptor, 17 drugs overlapped with drugs that inhibit the interaction of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike reported in the NCATS OpenData portal. Among them, enalaprilat, an ACE inhibitor, showed a Kd value of 1.5 nM against the ACE2. Furthermore, three of the top 30 drugs with strong affinity prediction for the TMPRSS2 are anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drugs, including ombitasvir, daclatasvir, and paritaprevir. Notably, of the top 30 drugs, AT1R blocker eprosartan and neuropsychiatric drug lisuride showed similar gene expression profiles to potential TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Collectively, we suggest that drugs predicted to have strong inhibitory potencies to ACE2 and TMPRSS2 through the DTI model should be considered as potential drug repurposing candidates for COVID-19.","Choi, Yoonjung; Shin, Bonggun; Kang, Keunsoo; Park, Sungsoo; Beck, Bo Ram",Viruses,206,30

On admission, the patient was deeply comatose, mechanically ventilated, with tachycardia up to 150 bpm, high blood pressure >210/120 mmHg and a body temperature >39°C. A computed tomography scan of the head showed a large intracerebral haemorrhage located in the deep structures of the right hemisphere, with a mass effect and bleeding to the ventricles. Rivaroxaban was discontinued at admission. The patient tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but he did not have typical symptoms of pneumonia. In the following days, the patient's neurological condition did not improve, and a fever of up to 40°C and abnormal coagulation parameters remained resistant to pharmacotherapy. The patient developed multi-system organ failure and died on day 8. Here, we review the recent literature and discuss the possible association of SARS-CoV-2-mediated endothelial injury and cardiovascular disorders with cerebrovascular complications.

Data from national government and the last published national audit of ICU resources indicate gross shortages. While the Critical Care Society of Southern Africa (CCSSA) guidelines provide a comprehensive guideline for triage in the face of overwhelmed ICU resources, such decisions present massive ethical and moral dilemmas for triage teams. It is therefore important for the health system to provide clinicians and critical care facilities with as much support and resources as possible in the face of impending pandemic demand. Following a discussion of the ethical considerations and potential challenges in applying the CCSSA guidelines, the authors propose a framework for regional triage committees adapted to the South African context. DISCUSSION: Beyond the national CCSSA guidelines, the clinician has many additional ethical and clinical considerations. No single ethical approach to decision-making is sufficient, instead one which considers multiple contextual factors is necessary. Scores such as the Clinical Frailty Score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment are of limited use in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, the clinician is fully justified in withdrawing ICU care based on medical futility decisions and to reallocate this resource to a patient with a better prognosis. However, these decisions bear heavy emotional and moral burden compounded by the volume of clinical work and a fear of litigation. CONCLUSION: We propose the formation of Provincial multi-disciplinary Critical Care Triage Committees to alleviate the emotional, moral and legal burden on individual ICU teams and co-ordinate inter-facility collaboration using an adapted framework. The committee would provide an impartial, broader and ethically-sound viewpoint which has time to consider broader contextual factors such as adjusting rationing criteria according to different levels of pandemic demand and the latest clinical evidence. Their functioning will be strengthened by direct feedback to national level and accountability to a national monitoring committee. The potential applications of these committees are far-reaching and have the potential to enable a more effective COVID-19 health systems response in South Africa.","Naidoo, Reshania; Naidoo, Kantharuben",BMC Med Ethics,206,16

Except leucoanthocyanin all other phytochemicals proved better than all three positive control drugs against SARS-CoV main peptidase, whereas, flabelliferin was found to be the potential inhibitor for SARS-CoV main proteinase out performing all the positive control drugs and phytochemicals. Amongst the compounds studied, the best inhibitor for COVID-19 main protease was nelfinavir followed by flabelliferin and ocimin. Flabelliferin was found to the best promising inhibitor of human cellular transmembrane serine proteinase, followed by nelfinavir, curcumin, piperine and marmelosin. The result on the inhibition of human cellular transmembrane serine proteinase against COVID-19 has a stable therapeutic advantage as mutation may quickly occur on viral drug targets. Hence, all the phytochemicals tested in the present study are the potential inhibitors of the all the four drug targets and can form a part of therapeutics against COVID-19 with further clinical studies.

The disease continues to present significant challenges to the health care systems around the world. This is primarily because of the lack of vaccines to protect against the infection and the lack of highly effective therapeutics to prevent and/or treat the illness. Nevertheless, researchers have swiftly responded to the pandemic by advancing old and new potential therapeutics into clinical trials. In this review, we summarize potential anti-COVID-19 therapeutics that block the early stage of the viral life cycle. The review presents the structures, mechanisms, and reported results of clinical trials of potential therapeutics that have been listed in clinicaltrials.gov. Given the fact that some of these therapeutics are multi-acting molecules, other relevant mechanisms will also be described. The reviewed therapeutics include small molecules and macromolecules of sulfated polysaccharides, polypeptides, and monoclonal antibodies. The potential therapeutics target viral and/or host proteins or processes that facilitate the early stage of the viral infection. Frequent targets are the viral spike protein, the host angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the host transmembrane protease serine 2, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis process. Overall, the review aims at presenting update-to-date details, so as to enhance awareness of potential therapeutics, and thus, to catalyze their appropriate use in combating the pandemic.","Al-Horani, Rami A; Kar, Srabani; Aliter, Kholoud F",,206,16

To set the stage, it recasts the basic SIR model of mathematical epidemic dynamics in an analytical mechanics setting. Thereby, it considers two possible re-parameterizations of the basic SIR model. On the one hand, it is proposed to re-scale time, while on the other hand, to transform the coordinates, i.e.\ the independent variables. In both cases, Hamilton's equations in terms of a suited Hamiltonian as well as Hamilton's principle in terms of a suited Lagrangian are considered in minimal and extended phase and state space coordinates, respectively. The corresponding Legendre transformations relating the various options for the Hamiltonians and Lagrangians are detailed. Ultimately, this contribution expands on a multitude of novel vistas on mathematical epidemic dynamics modelling that emerge from the analytical mechanics viewpoint. As result, it is believed that interesting and relevant new research avenues open up when exploiting in depth the analogies between analytical mechanics and mathematical epidemic dynamics modelling.","Steinmann, Paul",,206,26

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate symptoms in members of online long COVID peer support groups up to 6 months after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related symptoms. Methods: Demographics, symptoms, health status, work productivity, functional status and health-related quality of life were assessed about 3 and 6 months after the onset of COVID-19-related symptoms in members of online long COVID peer support groups. Results: Data from 239 patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis (83% women;median (interquartile range) age 50 (39-56) years) were analysed. During the infection, a median (interquartile range) of 15 (11-18) symptoms was reported, which was significantly lower 3 and 6 months later: 6 (4-9) and 6 (3-8), respectively (p&lt;0.05). From 3 to 6 months follow-up, the proportion of patients without symptoms increased from 1.3% to only 5.4% (p&lt;0.001). Patients also reported a significantly improved work productivity (work absenteeism and presenteeism: 73% versus 52% and 66% versus 60%, respectively), self-reported good health (9.2% versus 16.7%), functional status (mean±SD Post-COVID-19 Functional Status scale: 2.4±0.9 versus 2.2±1.0) and health-related quality of life (all p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Although patients with confirmed COVID-19, who were all members of online long COVID peer support groups, reported significant improvements in work productivity, functional status and quality of life between 3 and 6 months follow-up, these data clearly highlight the long-term impact of COVID-19, as approximately 6 months after the onset of COVID-19-related symptoms a large proportion still experienced persistent symptoms, a moderate-to-poor health, moderate-to-severe functional limitations, considerable loss in work productivity, and/or an impaired quality of life.

Again, most respondents demonstrated that their main source of health information during the COVID-19 pandemic was the internet followed by medical databases. The findings also indicated that major challenges encountered in seeking health information by most respondents were internet connectivity followed by lack of time and inadequate library resources.

The remit of the VFC within our hospital was expanded so as to include all referred ambulatory trauma. Outcomes of our VFC review over the 6-week period following the introduction of the national Irish COVID-19-related restrictions were gathered. These outcomes were analyzed and compared with the corresponding 6-week period from 2019. A 77.2% increase in the VFC referral volume was observed throughout the COVID-19-related period. Patients were directly discharged in 55.2% of cases in 2020, as opposed to 47.8% in 2019 (P = 0.044); referred directly for physiotherapy in 32.9% of cases in 2020, as opposed to 28.9% in 2019 (P = 0.173); and referred to a fracture clinic in 11.9% of cases in 2020, as opposed to 23.7% in 2019 (P < 0.001). Also, 3.0% of patients returned to the clinic after discharge in 2020, compared with 4.4% in 2019 (P = 0.237); 4.5% of patients were referred for surgery in 2020, as opposed to 2.2% in 2019 (P = 0.105).

We carried out a narrative review of international publications on the interactions of COVID-19 with the biological bases of suicide. RECENT FINDINGS: We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 interacts with multiple biological processes that underlie suicidal behavior, such as the renin-angiotensin system, nicotinic receptors, and central and systemic inflammation. Social distancing measures may also worsen subjective or objective social disconnection, thus increasing the risk of suicide. Interestingly, the drugs used to prevent suicide could be promising options to counteract brain damage caused by this coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 interacts with multiple biological pathways involved in suicide and opens a new window for understanding the suicidal process. The development of suicide prevention treatments in the context of a pandemic may benefit from knowledge on these interactions.","Conejero, I; Nobile, B; Olié, E; Courtet, Ph",Curr Psychiatry Rep,206,26

Here, we show that the twist angle can be used to control the spin-valley properties of transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers by changing the momentum alignment of the valleys in the two layers. Specifically, we observe that the interlayer excitons in twisted WSe_{2}/WSe_{2} bilayers exhibit a high (>60%) degree of circular polarization (DOCP) and long valley lifetimes (>40 ns) at zero electric and magnetic fields.

In 2020, following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, many people in the UK could not engage in their usual coastal practices due to a national lockdown and associated restrictions, including government bans in entering the sea. This paper shares findings from an exploratory study examining how these restrictions shaped the recreational coastal practices, perceptions and emotions of residents in the case study region of Devon, South West England. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 12 residents, with varying domestic and employment circumstances in the pandemic. We foreground three key themes identified through an inductive thematic analysis of the interviews: feeling ‘at home’ with the sea, experiencing a fragmented sense of home with Covid-19, and reconfiguring the coast as a therapeutic landscape. While important to understand the links between coastal proximity, health and wellbeing, we highlight the value of gaining more nuanced insights into the emotional, social, material and temporal dynamics that can re-shape the therapeutic potential of coastal encounter in the largely unprecedented situation of a global pandemic.","Jellard, S.; Bell, S.

Among the existing statistical models the most well-known one for this type of data is the multivariate probit model, which uses a Gaussian link to model dependence at the latent level. However, a symmetric link may not be appropriate if the data are highly imbalanced. Here, we propose a multivariate skew-elliptical link model for correlated binary responses, which includes the multivariate probit model as a special case. Furthermore, we perform Bayesian inference for this new model and prove that the regression coefficients have a closed-form unified skew-elliptical posterior. The new methodology is illustrated by application to COVID-19 pandemic data from three different counties of the state of California, USA. By jointly modeling extreme spikes in weekly new cases, our results show that the spatial dependence cannot be neglected. Furthermore, the results also show that the skewed latent structure of our proposed model improves the flexibility of the multivariate probit model and provides better fit to our highly imbalanced dataset.","Zhang, Zhongwei; Arellano-Valle, Reinaldo B.; Genton, Marc G.; Huser, Raphael",,206,16

Primary care clinicians in our health system reported an urgent need for support in advance care planning and end-of-life symptom management for their vulnerable patients. This article describes the design and dissemination of palliative care education for primary care clinicians using an established curriculum development method. OBJECTIVES: To develop a succinct and practical palliative care toolkit for use by primary care clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic, focused on 2 key elements: (i) advance care planning communication skills based on the narrative 3-Act Model and (ii) comfort care symptom management at the end of life. RESULTS: The toolkit was finalized through an iterative process involving a team of end-users and experts in palliative care and primary care, including social work, pharmacy, nursing, and medicine. The modules were formatted into an easily navigable, smartphone-friendly document to be used at point of care. The toolkit was disseminated to our institution's primary care network with practices spanning our state. Early feedback has been positive. CONCLUSION: While we had been focused primarily on the inpatient setting, our palliative care team at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center pivoted existing infrastructure and curriculum development expertise to meet the expressed needs of our primary care colleagues during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through collaboration with an interprofessional team including end-users, we designed and disseminated a concise palliative care toolkit within 6 weeks.","Roberts, Benjamin; Wright, Scott M; Christmas, Colleen; Robertson, Mariah; Wu, David Shih",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,206,1

After setting seropositivity thresholds for perfect specificity (100%), we estimated sensitivities of 95% for IgG, 90% for IgA, and 81% for IgM for detecting infected individuals between 15 and 28 days after symptom onset. While the median time to seroconversion was nearly 12 days across all three isotypes tested, IgA and IgM antibodies against RBD were short-lived with median times to seroreversion of 71 and 49 days after symptom onset. In contrast, anti-RBD IgG responses decayed slowly through 90 days with only 3 seropositive individuals seroreverting within this time period. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were strongly correlated with anti-S neutralizing antibody titers, which demonstrated little to no decrease over 75 days since symptom onset. We observed no cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted antibodies with other widely circulating coronaviruses (HKU1, 229 E, OC43, NL63). These data suggest that RBD-targeted antibodies are excellent markers of previous and recent infection, that differential isotype measurements can help distinguish between recent and older infections, and that IgG responses persist over the first few months after infection and are highly correlated with neutralizing antibodies.","Iyer, Anita S; Jones, Forrest K; Nodoushani, Ariana; Kelly, Meagan; Becker, Margaret; Slater, Damien; Mills, Rachel; Teng, Erica; Kamruzzaman, Mohammad; Garcia-Beltran, Wilfredo F; Astudillo, Michael; Yang, Diane; Miller, Tyler E; Oliver, Elizabeth; Fischinger, Stephanie; Atyeo, Caroline; Iafrate, A John; Calderwood, Stephen B; Lauer, Stephen A; Yu, Jingyou; Li, Zhenfeng; Feldman, Jared; Hauser, Blake M; Caradonna, Timothy M; Branda, John A; Turbett, Sarah E; LaRocque, Regina C; Mellon, Guillaume; Barouch, Dan H; Schmidt, Aaron G; Azman, Andrew S; Alter, Galit; Ryan, Edward T; Harris, Jason B; Charles, Richelle C",Sci. immunol,206,20

However, soon it became clear that long-term predictions were extremely challenging to address. In addition, it is still unclear which metric shall be used for a global description of the evolution of the outbreaks. Yet a robust modelling of pandemic dynamics and a consistent choice of the transmission metric is crucial for an in-depth understanding of the macroscopic phenomenology and better-informed mitigation strategies. In this study, we propose a Markovian stochastic framework designed for describing the evolution of entropy during the COVID-19 pandemic together with the instantaneous reproductive ratio. Then, we introduce and use entropy-based metrics of global transmission to measure the impact and the temporal evolution of a pandemic event. In the formulation of the model, the temporal evolution of the outbreak is modelled by an equation governing the probability distribution that describes a nonlinear Markov process of a statistically averaged individual, leading to a clear physical interpretation. The time-dependent parameters are formulated by adaptive basis functions, leading to a parsimonious representation. In addition, we provide a full Bayesian inversion scheme for calibration together with a coherent strategy to address data unreliability. The time evolution of the entropy rate, the absolute change in the system entropy, and the instantaneous reproductive ratio are natural and transparent outputs of this framework. The framework has the appealing property of being applicable to any compartmental epidemic model. As an illustration, we apply the proposed approach to a simple modification of the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed model. Applying the model to the Hubei region, South Korean, Italian, Spanish, German, and French COVID-19 datasets, we discover significant difference in the absolute change of entropy but highly regular trends for both the entropy evolution and the instantaneous reproductive ratio.","Wang, Ziqi; Broccardo, Marco; Mignan, Arnaud; Sornette, Didier",Nonlinear Dyn,206,2

The virus rapidly spread, and the World Health Organization declared a pandemic by March 2020. With millions of confirmed cases worldwide, there is growing concern and considerable debate regarding the potential for coronavirus infection to contribute to an appreciable burden of chronic respiratory symptoms or fibrotic disease among recovered individuals. Because the first case of COVID-19 was documented less than one year ago, data regarding long-term clinical outcomes are not yet available, and predictions for long-term outcome are speculative at best. However, due to the staggering number of cases and the severity of disease in many individuals, there is a critical need to consider the potential long-term implications of COVID-19. This review examines current basic and clinical data regarding fibrogenic mechanisms of viral injury in the context of SARS-CoV-2. Several intersecting mechanisms between coronavirus infection and fibrotic pathways are discussed to highlight factors and processes that may be targetable to improve patient outcome. Reports of post-infection sequelae from previous coronavirus outbreaks are presented toward the goal of improved recognition of potential contributing risk factors for fibrotic disease.","McDonald, Lindsay T",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,206,30

Because they are considered essential workers, vaccines may be made imminently available to them and offer an opportunity to reduce these COVID-19-related impacts. It is essential for a successful vaccination campaign to address the unique challenges arising from this workforce's inherently mobile nature and limited access to healthcare. Proposed strategies to overcome these challenges include ensuring farmworkers are prioritized in vaccine allocation and provided cost-free vaccines at convenient locations through partnerships among health authorities, community- and faith-based groups, and health centers with trusted community relationships. Further, a portable immunization record should be used, and coordination of care continued when a farmworker moves to a new geographic location. If implemented well, vaccinating farmworkers can reduce the COVID-19 disease burden among these essential workers, improve public health, and protect food and agriculture production.","Thomas, Christine M; Liebman, Amy K; Galván, Alma; Kirsch, Jonathan D; Stauffer, William M",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,206,1

On the basis that there are independent reasons to prefer lottery-based allocation of scarce lifesaving healthcare resources, I develop this idea, arguing that unweighted lottery procedures fail to satisfy healthcare providers' duty to prevent unjust population-level health outcomes, and thus that lotteries weighted in favour of Black individuals (and others who experience serious health injustice) are to be preferred.","Miller Tate, Alex James",J. med. ethics,206,20

This questionnaire survey was conducted amongst adult heart failure (HF) patients in the United Kingdom (UK), to understand the impact of COVID-19 upon HF services. METHODS AND RESULTS: The survey was conducted by the Pumping Marvellous Foundation, a UK HF patient charity. 'Survey Monkey' was used to disseminate the questionnaire in the Pumping Marvellous Foundation 's online patient group and in 10 UK hospitals (outpatient hospital and community HF clinics). There were 1050 responses collected (693/1050-66% women); 55% (579/1050) were aged over 60 years. Anxiety level was significantly higher regarding COVID-19 (mean 7 ± 2.5 on anxiety scale of 0 to 10) compared with anxiety regarding HF (6.1 ± 2.4; P < 0.001). Anxiety was higher amongst patients aged &#8804;60 years about HF (6.3 ± 2.2 vs. 5.9 ± 2.5 in those aged >60 years; P = 0.005) and COVID-19 (7.3 ± 2.3 vs. 6.7 ± 2.6 those aged >60 years; P < 0.001). Sixty-five per cent of respondents (686/1050) reported disruption to HF appointments (cancellation or postponement) during the lockdown period. Thirty-seven per cent reported disruption to medication prescription services, and Thirty-four per cent reported inability to access their HF teams promptly. Thirty-two per cent expressed reluctance to attend hospital (25% stated they would only attend hospital if there was no alternative, and 7% stated that they would not attend hospital at all). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant anxiety amongst HF patients regarding COVID-19 and HF.

Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here, we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV's capacity for human cell infection. Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections. These analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV and may help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV.IMPORTANCE The recent emergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert. 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses. Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV. This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.","Wan, Yushun; Shang, Jian; Graham, Rachel; Baric, Ralph S; Li, Fang",J. virol,206,21

Different molar ratios of L/Fe3+ :Ch/Fe3+ , doses and sampling times were used in hydroponic and soil experiments using soybean (Glycine max) as model Strategy I crop in calcareous conditions. Also, ligand competition between the humate and chelating agents was examined. RESULTS: Iron humate participates in the chelate shuttle mechanism providing available Fe to the chelating agent and then to the plants, showing a slight synergic effect. After a few days, the contribution of the chelates to the Fe nutrition decreases substantially, but the one from the humates is maintained. CONCLUSIONS: The most efficient ratio was two parts of iron humates and one part of iron chelate. In particular, HBED/Fe3+ was the most suitable iron chelate since its lasting effect fits better to the iron humate long-term effect.

(2) Multifunctionality of catheter usage during hospital shortage. Materials and Methods: During peak times of the novel COVID-19 virus, Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, New York was, among others, a highly impacted institution in one of the most case-prevalent counties in the state. The IR and surgery residents of Kings County Hospital developed a joint 24/7 emergency line team during the month of April at the height of COVID-19 infections. Being an urban hospital with limited ancillary staff, an over-capacity census, and newly formed ICU’s in outpatient facilities, the development of a line team was a necessary evolution to play a pivotal role in aiding our colleagues to treat the critically ill. IR and surgery residents were paired and placed on 12hr shifts, holding a dedicated cell phone. The sole responsibility was to place lines that were necessary on the floor including midlines, central lines, and hemodialysis catheters (HD). Results: Several supplies had run short during the peak of COVID-19 including most variations of central venous access catheters. Midlines were the most consulted procedure due to difficult access and long-term stay. During times of resource depletion, the application of various catheters was expanded with PICC lines cut short to be used for varying needs of central access and micropuncture sheaths sutured in place to be used as midlines. Tunneled HD catheters were used in place of temporary HD catheters. A total of 154 lines were placed at the bedside in critically ill COVID positive patients by the line team. The lines that were placed included 68 midlines (44%), 31 central lines (20%), and 55 HD catheters (35%). Conclusions: IR has the potential to play a vital role as an emergency team during times of uncertainty, such as a pandemic. Over the course of a month, 154 lines were placed which accelerated patient care and treatment. Our experience supports hospitals in the epicenter of a pandemic should consider a dedicated line team to provide support and aid in cross-departmental patient care delivery.","Grewal, T.; Provancha, I.; Swikehardt, M.; Patel, S.; Fahrtash, S.; Hammill, P.; Walsh, J.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,206,27

Yet studies specifically assessing the geriatric population are scarce. We aimed to examine the participation of elderly patients in therapeutic or prophylactic trials on COVID-19. METHODS: In this review, randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n = 12) comparing therapeutic or prophylactic interventions registered on preprint repositories and/or published since December 2019 were analyzed. We searched in PubMed, leading journals websites, and preprint repositories for RCTs and large observational studies. We aimed to describe the age of included patients, the presence of an upper age limit and of adjusted analyses on age, any exclusion criteria that could limit participation of elderly adults such as comorbidities, cognitive impairment, limitation of life expectancy; and the assessment of long-term outcomes such as the need of rehabilitation or institutionalization. Mean participant ages were reported and compared with observational studies. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs assessing drug therapy for COVID-19 were included. Mean age of patients included in RCTs was 56.3 years. An upper age limit was applied in three published trials (25%) and in 200/650 (31%) trials registered at clinicaltrials.gov . One trial reported a subgroup analysis in patients &#8805;65. Patients were excluded for liver-function abnormalities in eight trials, renal disease in six, cardiac disease or risk of torsade de pointes in five, and four for cognitive or mental criteria, which are frequent comorbidities in the oldest patients. Only three trials allowed a family member to provide consent. Patients enrolled in RCTs were on average 20 years younger than those included in large (n &#8805; 1000) observational studies. Seven studies had as their primary outcome a clinical endpoint, but none reported cognitive, functional or quality of life outcomes or need for rehabilitation or long-term care facility placement. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients are clearly underrepresented in RCTs, although they comprise the population hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Long-term outcomes such as the need of rehabilitation or institutionalization were not reported. Future investigations should target specifically this vulnerable population.","Prendki, Virginie; Tau, Noam; Avni, Tomer; Falcone, Marco; Huttner, Angela; Kaiser, Laurent; Paul, Mical; Leibovici-Weissmann, Yaara; Yahav, Dafna",BMC Geriatr,206,33

These models are posed by high uncertainties that affect lung segmentation and visual feature learning. We introduce MARL, a novel Multimodal Attentional Representation Learning model architecture that learns useful features from multimodal data under uncertainty. We feed the proposed model with both the lung CT-scan images and their perspective historical patients' biological records collected over times. Such rich data offers to analyse both spatial and temporal aspects of the disease. MARL employs Fuzzy-based image spatial segmentation to overcome uncertainties in CT-scan images. We then utilise a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn visual representation vectors from images. We augment patients' data with statistical features from the segmented images. We develop a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to represent the augmented data and learn sequential patterns of disease progressions. Finally, we inject both CNN and LSTM feature vectors to an attention layer to help focus on the best learning features. We evaluated MARL on regression of lung disease progression and status classification. MARL outperforms state-of-the-art CNN architectures, such as EfficientNet and DenseNet, and baseline prediction models. It achieves a 91% R^2 score, which is higher than the other models by a range of 8% to 27%. Also, MARL achieves 97% and 92% accuracy for binary and multi-class classification, respectively. MARL improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art CNN models with a range of 19% to 57%.

Herein, we have established an entropy-driven amplified electrochemiluminescence (ECL) strategy to detect the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2 known as RdRp-COVID which as the target for SARS-CoV-2 plays an essential role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. For the construction of the sensors, DNA tetrahedron (DT) is modified on the surface of the electrode to furnish robust and programmable scaffolds materials, upon which target DNA-participated entropy-driven amplified reaction is efficiently conducted to link the Ru (bpy)32+ modified S3 to the linear ssDNA at the vertex of the tetrahedron and eventually present an ""ECL on"" state. The rigid tetrahedral structure of the DT probe enhances the ECL intensity and avoids the cross-reactivity between single-stranded DNA, thus increasing the sensitivity of the assays. The enzyme-free entropy-driven reaction prevents the use of expensive enzyme reagents and facilitates the realization of large-scale screening of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Our DT-based ECL sensor has demonstrated significant specificity and high sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 2.67 fM. Additionally, our operational method has achieved the detection of RdRp-COVID in human serum samples, which supplies a reliable and feasible sensing platform for the clinical bioanalysis.","Fan, Zhenqiang; Yao, Bo; Ding, Yuedi; Zhao, Jing; Xie, Minhao; Zhang, Kai",Biosens Bioelectron,206,16

The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected substantially this high-risk population group. This present review was done to ascertain whether or not the pandemic has affected the 30-day mortality and outcomes of hip fracture in the elderly. Research Question: Does the coexistence of COVID-19 infection and hip fractures in the elderly increase the mortality rates? Methodology: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using three databases (PubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS) to compare the mortality rates between COVID-19 positive/suspect and COVID-19 negative patients. The secondary outcomes included comparison of in-hospital mortality, complication rate and length of hospital stay. Risk of bias assessment was done using the MINORS tool. Results: The present review included 20 studies. Primary outcome: A significantly higher 30 day mortality rate was seen in COVID-19 positive/suspect patients with an Odds ratio of 6.09 (95% CI 4.75-8.59, p < 0.00001). Secondary outcome: We observed significantly higher rates of inpatient mortality [OR 18.22, (95% CI 7.10-46.75], complication rate (OR 9.28, 95% CI 4.46-19.30), and length of hospital stay (MD: 4.96, 95% CI 2.86-7.05) in COVID-19 positive/suspect patients as compared to COVID-19 negative patients. Conclusion: COVID-19 has deteriorated the outcomes in elderly patients with hip fractures and associated with higher rates of mortality in the short term.

METHODS: XRCC1 rs25487 was genotyped in lymphocytes from serial peripheral blood samples. Severe RIL was defined as absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <0.3×109 cells/L. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify independent risk factors, which were then used to group patients according to risk of severe RIL. RESULTS: Univariate analysis of the 178 patients in this analysis showed that older age, larger tumors, higher lung V5 and mean lung dose, and higher heart V5 and mean heart dose were associated with severe RIL during treatment (P<0.05). The XRCC1 rs25487 AA genotype was also associated with increased risk of severe RIL during treatment (AA vs. others: hazard ratio [HR] =1.065, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.089-2.500, P = 0.018). Multivariate analyses showed that older age (HR=1.031, 95% CI 1.009-1.054, P=0.005), lung V5 (HR=1.039, 95% CI 1.023-1.055, P<0.001), and AA genotype (AA vs. others, HR=1.768, 95% CI 1.165-2.684, P=0.007) were independently associated with higher incidence of severe RIL. These three risk factors (age &#8805;56 years, lung V5 &#8805;51% and XRCC1 rs25487 AA) distinguished patients at different risk of developing severe RIL (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Age, lung V5 and XRCC1 rs25487 AA were all linked with risk of severe RIL. Our predictive risk model may be helpful for identifying patients at high risk of severe RIL so that treatment can be modified.","Xie, Xiaoxue; Lin, Steven H; Welsh, James W; Wei, Xiong; Jin, Hekun; Mohan, Radhe; Liao, Zhongxing; Xu, Ting",Radiother. oncol,206,1

This study examines differences in physical activity, screen time, and outdoor policies and practices by QRIS certification. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Online. SAMPLE: After exclusion criteria, respondents were 431 Texas childcare centers. MEASURES: 2016 survey of policies and Go NAPSACC best practices. ANALYSIS: Chi-square and t-tests indicated differences in 1) practices and 2) policies by QRIS status. RESULTS: TRS-certified centers reported more policies for physical activity (M = 4.57 ± 3.07 vs. 3.61 ± 2.95, p = 0.009) and screen time (M = 1.91 ± 1.84 vs. 1.28 ± 1.56, p < 0.001) than non-certified centers.

This beta gene virus, very close to bat coronaviruses (bat-CoV-RaTG13) and bat-SL-CoVZC45, causes a severe disease, similar to those caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and SARS-CoV viruses, featured by low to moderate mortality rate. Unfortunately, the antiviral drugs commonly used in clinical practice to treat viral infections, are not applicable to SARS-Cov-2 and no vaccine is available. Thus, it is extremely necessary to identify new drugs suitable for the treatment of the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Different preclinical studies conducted on other coronaviruses suggested that promising clinical outcomes for 2019-nCoV should be obtained by using alpha-interferon, chloroquine phosphate, arabinol, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Moreover, clinical trials with these suitable drugs should be performed on patients affected by SARS-Cov-2 to prove their efficacy and safety. Finally, a very promising therapeutic drug, tocilizumab, is discussed; it is currently used to treat patients presenting COVID-19 pneumonia.

However, the number of such switches is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest2. The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)3, we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibodies against the membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. The former, which incorporates a de novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder4, has a limit of detection of 15 pM and a luminescence signal 50-fold higher than the background level. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes, and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.","Quijano-Rubio, Alfredo; Yeh, Hsien-Wei; Park, Jooyoung; Lee, Hansol; Langan, Robert A; Boyken, Scott E; Lajoie, Marc J; Cao, Longxing; Chow, Cameron M; Miranda, Marcos C; Wi, Jimin; Hong, Hyo Jeong; Stewart, Lance; Oh, Byung-Ha; Baker, David",Nature,206,1

With the escalating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on society in the United States and around the world, the CDC has become one of the focal points of public discussion. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the topics and their overarching themes emerging from the public COVID-19-related discussion about the CDC on Twitter and to further provide insight into public's concerns, focus of attention, perception of the CDC's current performance, and expectations from the CDC. METHODS: Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to August 14, 2020. We used R (The R Foundation) to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained any of five specific keywords-cdc, CDC, centers for disease control and prevention, CDCgov, and cdcgov-while eliminating all 91 tweets posted by the CDC itself. The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 290,764 unique tweets from 152,314 different users. We used R to perform the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm for topic modeling. RESULTS: The Twitter data generated 16 topics that the public linked to the CDC when they talked about COVID-19. Among the topics, the most discussed was COVID-19 death counts, accounting for 12.16% (n=35,347) of the total 290,764 tweets in the analysis, followed by general opinions about the credibility of the CDC and other authorities and the CDC's COVID-19 guidelines, with over 20,000 tweets for each. The 16 topics fell into four overarching themes: knowing the virus and the situation, policy and government actions, response guidelines, and general opinion about credibility. CONCLUSIONS: Social media platforms, such as Twitter, provide valuable databases for public opinion. In a protracted pandemic, such as COVID-19, quickly and efficiently identifying the topics within the public discussion on Twitter would help public health agencies improve the next-round communication with the public.","Lyu, Joanne Chen; Luli, Garving K",J Med Internet Res,206,20

In a deterministic formulation of the problem the steady state assumption has to be fulfilled exactly, and the observed fluxes are included in the model without accounting for experimental noise. One can relax the steady state constraint, and also include experimental noise in the model, through a stochastic formulation of the problem. Uniform sampling of fluxes, feasible in both the deterministic and stochastic formulation, can provide us with statistical properties of the metabolic network, such as marginal flux probability distributions. In this study we give an overview of both the deterministic and stochastic formulation of the problem, and of available Monte Carlo sampling methods for sampling the corresponding solution space. We apply the ACHR, OPTGP, CHRR and Gibbs sampling algorithms to ten metabolic networks and evaluate their convergence, consistency and efficiency. The coordinate hit-and-run with rounding (CHRR) is found to perform best among the algorithms suitable for the deterministic formulation. A desirable property of CHRR is its guaranteed distributional convergence. Among the three other algorithms, ACHR has the largest consistency with CHRR for genome scale models. For the stochastic formulation, the Gibbs sampler is the only method appropriate for sampling at genome scale. However, our analysis ranks it as less efficient than the samplers used for the deterministic formulation.","Fallahi, Shirin; Skaug, Hans J; Alendal, Guttorm",PLoS One,206,1

Currently, limited testing locations and expensive equipment pose difficulties for individuals trying to be tested, especially in low-resource settings. Researchers have successfully presented models for detecting COVID-19 infection status using audio samples recorded in clinical settings [5, 15], suggesting that audio-based Artificial Intelligence models can be used to identify COVID-19. Such models have the potential to be deployed on smartphones for fast, widespread, and low-resource testing. However, while previous studies have trained models on cleaned audio samples collected mainly from clinical settings, audio samples collected from average smartphones may yield suboptimal quality data that is different from the clean data that models were trained on. This discrepancy may add a bias that affects COVID-19 status predictions. To tackle this issue, we propose a multi-branch deep learning network that is trained and tested on crowdsourced data where most of the data has not been manually processed and cleaned. Furthermore, the model achieves state-of-art results for the COUGHVID dataset [16]. After breaking down results for each category, we have shown an AUC of 0.99 for audio samples with COVID-19 positive labels.","Fakhry, Ahmed; Jiang, Xinyi; Xiao, Jaclyn; Chaudhari, Gunvant; Han, Asriel; Khanzada, Amil",,206,22

Currently, there is no specific viral protein-targeted therapeutics. Viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. However, the structural information of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein remains unclear. Herein, we have determined the 2.7 Å crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Although the overall structure is similar as other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential RNA binding pocket alongside the ß-sheet core. Complemented by in vitro binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, guiding the design of novel antiviral agents specific targeting to SARS-CoV-2.","Kang, Sisi; Yang, Mei; Hong, Zhongsi; Zhang, Liping; Huang, Zhaoxia; Chen, Xiaoxue; He, Suhua; Zhou, Ziliang; Zhou, Zhechong; Chen, Qiuyue; Yan, Yan; Zhang, Changsheng; Shan, Hong; Chen, Shoudeng",,206,20

DESIGN: Nationwide case-control study. SETTING: Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: All Danish children born from 1997 to 2014 and followed for asthma onset and persistent wheezing from age 1 year to 15 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Onset of asthma and persistent wheezing. RESULTS: A higher incidence of asthma was found in children of parents with asthma (adjusted hazard ratio 2.29 (95% confidence interval 2.22 to 2.35) and mothers who smoked during pregnancy (1.20, 1.18 to 1.22), whereas a lower incidence was found in children of parents with high educational attainment (0.72, 0.69 to 0.75) and high incomes (0.85, 0.81 to 0.89). Exposure to particulate matter &#8804;2.5 µm (PM2.5) and &#8804;10 µm (PM10) and nitrate was associated with an increased risk of asthma and persistent wheezing, with hazard ratios per 5 µg/m3 increase in pollutant concentrations 1.05 (1.03 to 1.07) for PM2.5, 1.04 (1.02 to 1.06) for PM10, and 1.04 (1.03 to 1.04) for nitrogen dioxide. Only the positive association of PM2.5 with asthma and persistent wheezing remained robust across the different models and in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that children exposed to higher levels of PM2.5 are more likely to develop asthma and persistent wheezing than children who are not exposed. Other risk factors associated with these outcomes were parental asthma, parental education, and maternal smoking during pregnancy.","Holst, Gitte J; Pedersen, Carsten B; Thygesen, Malene; Brandt, Jørgen; Geels, Camilla; Bønløkke, Jakob H; Sigsgaard, Torben",BMJ,206,13

Since the outbreak of the ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, a key question has focused on whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cells stimulated during acute infection give rise to long-lived memory T cells3. Using spectral flow cytometry combined with cellular indexing of transcriptomes and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing we longitudinally characterize individual SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells of COVID-19 patients from acute infection to one year into recovery and find a distinct signature identifying long-lived memory CD8+ T cells. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells persisting one year after acute infection re-express CD45RA and interleukin-7 receptor (CD127), upregulate T cell factor-1 (TCF1), and maintain low CCR7, thus resembling CD45RA+ effector-memory T (TEMRA) cells. Tracking individual clones of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, we reveal that an interferon signature marks clones giving rise to long-lived cells, whereas prolonged proliferation and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling are associated with clone contraction and disappearance. Collectively, we identify a transcriptional signature differentiating short-from long-lived memory CD8+ T cells following an acute virus infection in humans.","Adamo, Sarah; Michler, Jan; Zurbuchen, Yves; Cervia, Carlo; Taeschler, Patrick; Raeber, Miro E.; Sain, Simona Baghai; Nilsson, Jakob; Moor, Andreas; Boyman, Onur",,206,25

We compared the incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death and death or intensive services use) among hospitalized famotidine users vs proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users, hydroxychloroquine users, or famotidine nonusers separately. METHODS: We constructed a retrospective cohort study using data from COVID-19 Premier Hospital electronic health records. The study population was COVID-19 hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older. Famotidine, PPI, and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any medication containing 1 of the 3 drugs on the day of admission. The famotidine nonuser group was derived from the same source population with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine as an active ingredient before or on the day of admission. Time at risk was defined based on the intention-to-treat principle starting 1 day after admission to 30 days after admission. For each study comparison group, we fit a propensity score model through large-scale regularized logistic regression. The outcome was modeled using a survival model. RESULTS: We identified 2,193 users of PPI, 5,950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1,816 users of famotidine, and 26,820 nonfamotidine users. After propensity score stratification, the hazard ratios (HRs) for death were as follows: famotidine vs no famotidine HR 1.03 (0.89-1.18), vs PPIs: HR 1.14 (0.94-1.39), and vs hydroxychloroquine: 1.03 (0.85-1.24). Similar results were observed for the risk of death or intensive services use. DISCUSSION: We found no evidence of a reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who used famotidine compared with those who did not or compared with PPI or hydroxychloroquine users.","Shoaibi, Azza; Fortin, Stephen Patrick; Weinstein, Rachel; Berlin, Jesse A; Ryan, Patrick",Am. j. gastroenterol.

While olfactory alterations may be observed in patients with rhinovirus, influenza virus, or parainfluenza virus infection, they are typically explained by nasal obstruction with mucus or direct epithelial damage; in the case of SARS-CoV-2, olfactory alterations may present without nasal congestion with mucus. We performed a study of patients presenting olfactory/gustatory alterations in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to contribute to the understanding of this phenomenon. Material and Methods: We performed a descriptive, cross-sectional, observational study of the clinical characteristics of olfactory/gustatory alterations using a self-administered, anonymous online questionnaire. Results: A total of 909 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and olfactory/gustatory alterations responded to the questionnaire in the 4-day data collection period; 824 cases (90.65%) reported simultaneous olfactory and gustatory involvement. Patients' responses to the questionnaire revealed ageusia (581, 64.1% of respondents), hypogeusia (256, 28.2%), dysgeusia (22, 2.4%), anosmia (752 82.8%), hyposmia (142, 15.6%), and dysosmia (8, 0.9%).

The overall pooled CFR was 7% (95% CI 6-7%). The crude CFRs increased significantly with increasing number of chronic comorbid conditions, ranging from 6% for at least one chronic comorbid condition to 13% for 2 or 3 chronic comorbid conditions, 12% for 4 chronic comorbid conditions, 14% for 5 chronic comorbid conditions, and 21% for 6 or more chronic comorbid conditions. Furthermore, the overall CFRs also significantly increased with higher levels of reported clinical symptoms, ranging from 14% for at least four symptoms, to 15% for 5 or 6 symptoms, and 21% for 7 or more symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The chronic comorbid conditions were identified as dominating risk factors, which should be considered in an emergency disease management and treatment choices. There is urgent need to further enhance systematic and real-time sharing of epidemiologic data, clinical results, and experience to inform the global response to COVID-19.","Mahumud, Rashidul Alam; Kamara, Joseph K; Renzaho, Andre M N",Infection,206,26

Parallel to research focused on risk factors, it could be useful to investigate the factors that help to cope with such crises at an emotional level. Therefore, this study aimed to strengthen the role of variables that protect from subjective distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, explore the pathways between satisfaction with life and perceived stress, and consider the role of coping strategies and defense mechanisms in this relationship. A sample of 1102 Italian participants who were experiencing the COVID-19 lockdown measures (Mage = 34.91, SD = 11.91) completed an online survey in which the Ten Item Perceived Stress Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory and Forty-Item Defense Style Questionnaire were included. The data were analyzed using Pearson's r correlations and moderation analysis. A chained-mediation model showed that the relationship between life satisfaction and perceived stress is partially mediated by approach coping, positive attitude and mature defenses. This study contributes toward gaining a better understanding of a protective pathway for mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings could be useful from both a preventive and an intervention perspective.","Gori, Alessio; Topino, Eleonora; Di Fabio, Annamaria",PLoS One,206,15

Though its pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been recently identified as a receptor for the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the cell. Here, we aimed to clarify the potential role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2-induced acute lung injury and its underlying mechanism. As a receptor for coronavirus, ACE2 mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells in a similar way as for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The high binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 correlates with its efficient spread among humans. On the other hand, ACE2 negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) primarily by converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1–7, which exerts a beneficial effect on coronavirus-induced acute lung injury. Human recombinant ACE2 has been considered as a potential therapy for SARS-CoV-2 by blocking virus entry and redressing the imbalance of RAAS in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The level of ACE2 expression can be upregulated by treatment with an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin Ⅱ type 1 receptor blocker (ARB). To date, no evidence shows that ACEIs or ARBs increase the susceptibility and mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and hence, it is not advisable to discontinue such drugs in patients with cardiovascular disease.","Liu, Meng-Yuan; Zheng, Bo; Zhang, Yan; Li, Jian-Ping",Chronic Dis.

Our spectroscopic follow-up is complete for 83% of the white dwarfs hotter than 6000 K, where the atmospheric composition can be constrained reliably. We identify 1508 DA white dwarfs with pure hydrogen atmospheres. The DA mass distribution has an extremely narrow peak at $0.59~M_{\odot}$, and reveals a shoulder from relatively massive white dwarfs with $M=0.7$-$0.9~M_{\odot}$. Comparing this distribution with binary population synthesis models, we find that the contribution from single stars that form through mergers cannot explain the over-abundance of massive white dwarfs. In addition, the mass distribution of cool DAs shows a near absence of $M>1~M_{\odot}$ white dwarfs. The pile-up of 0.7-$0.9~M_{\odot}$ and the disappearance of $M>1~M_{\odot}$ white dwarfs is consistent with the effects of core crystallization. Even though the evolutionary models predict the location of the pile-up correctly, the delay from the latent heat of crystallization by itself is insufficient to create a significant pile-up, and additional cooling delays from related effects like phase separation are necessary. We also discuss the population of infrared-faint (ultracool) white dwarfs, and demonstrate for the first time the existence of a well defined sequence in color and magnitude. Curiously, this sequence is connected to a region in the color-magnitude diagrams where the number of helium-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs is low. This suggests that the infrared-faint white dwarfs likely have mixed H/He atmospheres.","Kilic, Mukremin; Bergeron, P.; Kosakowski, Alekzander; Brown, Warren R.; Agueros, Marcel A.; Blouin, Simon",,206,16

We identified panels of fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from large phage-displayed Fab, scFv, and VH libraries by panning against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. A high-affinity Fab was selected from one of the libraries and converted to a full-size antibody, IgG1 ab1, which competed with human ACE2 for binding to RBD. It potently neutralized replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV, as measured by two different tissue culture assays, as well as a replication-competent mouse ACE2-adapted SARS-CoV-2 in BALB/c mice and native virus in hACE2-expressing transgenic mice showing activity at the lowest tested dose of 2 mg/kg. IgG1 ab1 also exhibited high prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mechanism of neutralization is by competition with ACE2 but could involve antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) as IgG1 ab1 had ADCC activity in vitro. The ab1 sequence has a relatively low number of somatic mutations, indicating that ab1-like antibodies could be quickly elicited during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or by RBD-based vaccines. IgG1 ab1 did not aggregate, did not exhibit other developability liabilities, and did not bind to any of the 5,300 human membrane-associated proteins tested. These results suggest that IgG1 ab1 has potential for therapy and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The rapid identification (within 6 d of availability of antigen for panning) of potent mAbs shows the value of large antibody libraries for response to public health threats from emerging microbes.","Li, Wei; Chen, Chuan; Drelich, Aleksandra; Martinez, David R; Gralinski, Lisa E; Sun, Zehua; Schäfer, Alexandra; Kulkarni, Swarali S; Liu, Xianglei; Leist, Sarah R; Zhelev, Doncho V; Zhang, Liyong; Kim, Ye-Jin; Peterson, Eric C; Conard, Alex; Mellors, John W; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Falzarano, Darryl; Baric, Ralph S; Dimitrov, Dimiter S",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,206,20

Specifically, particulate matters (PM), a form of air pollution, can contribute to cardiovascular morbidity and lung diseases. Nowadays, humans are exposed to PM pollution everywhere because it occurs in both indoor and outdoor environments. To purify or ventilate polluted air, one need to accurately monitor the ambient air quality. Therefore, this study proposed a practical particulate matter sensing and accurate calibration system using low-cost commercial sensors. The proposed system basically uses noisy and inaccurate PM sensors to measure the ambient air pollution. This paper mainly deals with three types of error caused in the light scattering method: short-term noise, part-to-part variation, and temperature and humidity interferences. We propose a simple short-term noise reduction method to correct measurement errors, an auto-fitting calibration for part-to-part repeatability to pinpoint the baseline of the signal that affects the performance of the system, and a temperature and humidity compensation method. This paper also contains the experiment setup and performance evaluation to prove the superiority of the proposed methods. Based on the evaluation of the performance of the proposed system, part-to-part repeatability was less than 2 µg/m3 and the standard deviation was approximately 1.1 µg/m3 in the air. When the proposed approaches are used for other optical sensors, it can result in better performance.","Cho, Hyuntae; Baek, Yunju",Sensors (Basel),206,16

The presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 (ACE2), the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in human placentas indicates that this organ can be vulnerable for viral infection during pregnancy. However, for this to happen, additional molecular processes are critical to allow viral entry in cells, its replication and disease manifestation, particularly in the placenta and/or feto–maternal circulation. Beyond the risk of vertical transmission, COVID-19 is also proposed to deplete ACE2 protein and its biological actions in the placenta. It is postulated that such effects may impair essential processes during placentation and maternal hemodynamic adaptations in COVID-19 pregnancy, features also observed in several disorders of pregnancy. This review gathers information indicating risks and protective features related to ACE2 changes in COVID-19 pregnancies. First, we describe the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection having ACE2 as a main entry door and current evidence of viral infection in the placenta. Further, we discuss the central role of ACE2 in physiological systems such as the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) and the kallikrein–kinin system (KKS), both active during placentation and hemodynamic adaptations of pregnancy. Significant knowledge gaps are also identified and should be urgently filled to better understand the fate of ACE2 in COVID-19 pregnancies and the potential associated risks. Emerging knowledge will be able to improve the early stratification of high-risk pregnancies with COVID-19 exposure as well as to guide better management and follow-up of these mothers and their children.","Azinheira Nobrega Cruz, Nayara; Stoll, Danielle; Casarini, Dulce Elena; Bertagnolli, Mariane",Clin Sci (Lond),206,2

In this study, we aimed to investigate the longitudinal changes of psychological distress and quality of life in these patient groups. METHODS: Patients with conservatively managed (CM) or operated (OM) meningiomas and excellent neurological status, who were screened for psychological distress during the follow-up visit (t1), were included. We performed a follow-up mail/telephone-based survey 3–6 months (t2) after t1. Distress was measured using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Distress Thermometer (DT), 36-item Short Form (SF-36), and Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). RESULTS: Sixty-two patients participated in t1 and 47 in t2. The number of patients reporting increased or borderline values remained high 3 months after initial presentation, with n = 25 (53%) of patients reporting increased anxiety symptom severity and n = 29 (62%) reporting increased depressive symptom severity values. The proportion of distressed patients according to a DT score remained similar after 3 months. Forty-four percent of patients reported significant distress in OM and 33% in CM group. The most common problems among distressed patients were fatigue (t2 75%) and worries (t2 50%), followed by pain, sleep disturbances, sadness, and nervousness. Tumor progress was associated with increased depression scores (OR 6.3 (1.1–36.7)). CONCLUSION: The level of psychological distress in asymptomatic meningiomas and postoperative meningiomas with excellent outcome is high.

The country clearly had a plan for the mental health consequences of COVID. The impacts of lockdown were identified early, and steps taken to mitigate them. There was no spike in tertiary mental health presentations. Telehealth was embraced, support services mobilized, and public awareness of mental health issues made part of the conversation.

While developed countries easily adapt their well-organized routine laboratory services, resource-limited countries need considerable capacity building as many gaps still exist. In this paper, we discuss some of the efforts made by the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET) in supporting laboratory capacity development in the Africa region. The efforts range from promoting graduate level training programs to building advanced technical, managerial and leadership skills to in-service short course training for peripheral laboratory staff. A number of specific projects focus on external quality assurance, basic laboratory information systems, strengthening laboratory management towards accreditation, equipment calibration, harmonization of training materials, networking and provision of pre-packaged laboratory kits to support outbreak investigation. Available evidence indicates a positive effect of these efforts on laboratory capacity in the region. However, many opportunities exist, especially to support the roll-out of these projects as well as attending to some additional critical areas such as biosafety and biosecuity. We conclude that AFENET’s approach of strengthening national and sub-national systems provide a model that could be adopted in resource-limited settings such as sub-Saharan Africa.","Masanza, Monica Musenero; Nqobile, Ndlovu; Mukanga, David; Gitta, Sheba Nakacubo",BMC Public Health,206,28

The present study examined willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, the associated reasons for willingness/unwillingness, and vaccine safety perceptions in a cross-sectional assessment of community adults in Ontario. Methods: One thousand three hundred sixty seven individuals (60.6% female, mean age = 37.5%) participated in this study between January 15, 2021 and February 15, 2021. Perceptions of vaccine safety and reasons for willingness/unwillingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine were investigated using an online assessment. Perceptions were investigated in general and by age, sex and education using analysis of variance. Results: Overall, 82.8% of the sample reported they were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and 17.2% reported they were unwilling. The three most common reasons for unwillingness were long-term side effects (65.5%), immediate side effects (60.5%), and lack of trust in the vaccine (55.2%). Vaccine willingness significantly differed by sex and education level, with female participants and those with less than a bachelor's degree being more likely to report unwillingness. Perception of COVID-19 vaccine safety was significantly lower (−10.3%) than vaccines in general and differed by age, sex and education, with females, older adults, and individuals with less than a bachelor's degree reporting lower perceived COVID-19 vaccine safety. Conclusion: In this sample of community adults, the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy rate was less than one in five individuals, but with higher rates in population subgroups.

DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Tertiary-care university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixteen consecutive critically ill, invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 ARDS. INTERVENTIONS: The authors collected demographic, mechanical ventilation, imaging, laboratory, and outcome data. Primary outcome was the incidence of PNX/PMD. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of PNX/PMD. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PNX/PMD occurred in a total of 28 patients (24.1%), with 22 patients developing PNX (19.0%) and 13 developing PMD (11.2%). Mean time to development of PNX/PMD was 14 ± 11 days from intubation. The authors found no significant difference in mechanical ventilation parameters between patients who developed PNX/PMD and those who did not. Mechanical ventilation parameters were within recommended limits for protective ventilation in both groups. Ninety-five percent of patients with PNX/PMD had the Macklin effect (linear collections of air contiguous to the bronchovascular sheaths) on a baseline computed tomography scan, and tended to have a higher lung involvement at intensive care unit (ICU) admission (Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema score 32.2 ± 13.4 v 18.7 ± 9.8 in patients without PNX/PMD, p = 0.08). Time from symptom onset to intubation and time from total bilirubin on day two after ICU admission were the only independent predictors of PNX/PMD. Mortality was 60.7% in patients who developed PNX/PMD versus 38.6% in those who did not (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: PNX/PMD occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation, and is associated with increased mortality. Development of PNX/PMD seems to occur despite use of protective mechanical ventilation and has a radiologic predictor sign.","Belletti, Alessandro; Palumbo, Diego; Zangrillo, Alberto; Fominskiy, Evgeny V.; Franchini, Stefano; Dell'Acqua, Antonio; Marinosci, Alessandro; Monti, Giacomo; Vitali, Giordano; Colombo, Sergio; Guazzarotti, Giorgia; Lembo, Rosalba; Maimeri, Nicolò; Faustini, Carolina; Pennella, Renato; Mushtaq, Junaid; Landoni, Giovanni; Scandroglio, Anna Mara; Dagna, Lorenzo; De Cobelli, Francesco",J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,206,16

We aimed to establish a relationship between the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 for early detection and assessment to reduce the transmission rate of SARS-Cov-2. Methods: We collected published data on the clinical features of Covid-19 retrospectively and categorized them into physical and blood biomarkers. Common features were assigned scores by the Borg scoring method with slight modifications and were incorporated into a newly-developed Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 assessment Chart. Correlations between signs and symptoms with the development of Covid-19 was assessed by Pearson correlation and Spearman Correlation coefficient (rho). Linear regression analysis was employed to assess the highest correlating features. The frequency of signs and symptoms in developing Covid-19 was assessed through Chi-square test two tailed with Cramer's V strength. Changes in signs and symptoms were incorporated into a chart that consisted of four tiers representing disease stages. Results: Data from 10,172 Covid-19 laboratory confirmed cases showed a correlation with Fever in 43.9% (P = 0.000) cases, cough 54.08% and dry mucus 25.68% equally significant (P = 0.000), Hyperemic pharyngeal mucus membrane 17.92% (P = 0.005), leukopenia 28.11% (P = 0.000), lymphopenia 64.35% (P = 0.000), thrombopenia 35.49% (P = 0.000), elevated Alanine aminotransferase 50.02% (P = 0.000), and Aspartate aminotransferase 34.49% (P = 0.000). The chart exhibited a maximum scoring of 39. Normal tier scoring was ≤ 12/39, mild state scoring was 13–22/39, and star values scoring was ≥7/15; this latter category on the chart means Covid-19 is progressing and quarantine should be adopted.

There is growing recognition that digital technologies have the potential to improve the well-being of frontline workers. However, there has been limited development of wellness interventions using mobile health (mHealth) technology. More importantly, little research has been conducted on how frontline workers perceive mHealth-based support to promote their well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore frontline workers’ experience of conventional psychological wellness programs and their perceptions of the usefulness of mHealth apps and features for promoting well-being. It also sought to identify factors that could potentially influence uptake and retention of an mHealth-based wellness program. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews using purposive sampling with frontline workers involved in the COVID-19 response. Various visual materials, collated from existing mHealth app features, were presented to facilitate discussion. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis based on grounded theory was undertaken. Themes were subsequently mapped to key nudge strategies—those commonly used for mHealth development—to assess participants’ preferences for particular features and their reasoning. RESULTS: A total of 42 frontline workers participated in 12 one-on-one interviews or focus group discussions. Frontline workers generally had a limited ability to identify their own psychological problems and liked the reminders functionality of the app to track their mood over time. A personalized goal-setting feature (ie, tailoring) and in-app resources were generally valued, while frequent coaching and messages (ie, framing) were seen as a distraction. The majority of participants desired a built-in chat function with a counselor (ie, guidance) for reasons of accessibility and protection of privacy. Very few participants appreciated a gamification function. Frontline workers commonly reported the need for ongoing social support and desired access to an in-app peer support community (ie, social influence). There were, however, concerns regarding potential risks from virtual peer interactions. Intrinsic motivational factors, mHealth app technicality, and tangible rewards were identified as critical for uptake and retention. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the potential of mHealth apps with relevant features to be used as wellness tools by frontline health care workers. Future work should focus on developing a nonintrusive and personalized mHealth app with in-app counseling, peer support to improve well-being, and tangible and extrinsic rewards to foster continued use.","Yoon, Sungwon; Goh, Hendra; Nadarajan, Gayathri Devi; Sung, Sharon; Teo, Irene; Lee, Jungup; Ong, Marcus E H; Graves, Nicholas; Teo, Tess Lin",J Med Internet Res,206,16

Nevertheless, very little research has examined predicting depressed mood within a day, which is essential given the large amount of variation occurring within days. The current study utilized passively collected sensor data collected from a smartphone application to future depressed mood from hour-to-hour in an ecological momentary assessment study in a sample reporting clinical levels of depression (N = 31). Using a combination of nomothetic and idiographically-weighted machine learning models, the results suggest that depressed mood can be accurately predicted from hour to hour with an average correlation between out of sample predicted depressed mood levels and observed depressed mood of 0.587, CI [0.552, 0.621]. This suggests that passively collected smartphone data can accurately predict future depressed mood among a sample reporting clinical levels of depression. If replicated in other samples, this modeling framework may allow just-in-time adaptive interventions to treat depression as it changes in the context of daily life.","Jacobson, Nicholas C.; Chung, Yeon Joo",Sensors (Basel),206,20

Serological screening was carried out on 303 samples from animals slaughtered between 2005 and 2008, and random-effect logistic regression models were developed for pathogens with a ‘non-zero’ prevalence. The apparent animal prevalence for PPV, PCV2, and L. intracellularis was 46.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41–52%), 51.1% (95% CI 45–57%) and 59.2% (95% CI 54–65%), respectively. Apparent farm seroprevalence rates for PPV, PCV2 and Lawsonia intracellularis were 56.3% (95% CI, 39–73%), 21.9% (95% CI, 8–36%) and 78.1% (95% CI, 64–92%), respectively. No antibodies were detected against SIV, ADV, CSFV, SVDV, TGEV, PRSSV, Leptospira spp., Brucella spp., or M. hyopneumoniae. Increasing herd size, proximity to dense populations of domestic swine and later sampling times within the survey period were found to be risk factors. Overall, the seroprevalence of these pathogens in farmed wild boar was similar to that in the farmed domestic pig population in Finland. However, it is possible that the rearing of wild boars in fenced estates may predispose them to particular infections, as reflected in higher antibody titres.","Hälli, Outi; Ala-Kurikka, Eve; Nokireki, Tiina; Skrzypczak, Teresa; Raunio-Saarnisto, Mirja; Peltoniemi, Olli A.T.; Heinonen, Mari",Vet J,206,5

Health professionals (HPs) lose insight of the gaps in medical care. The views of student nurses can help improve systems. The objective of this study was to assess the views of our student nurses and how they perceive the way the doctors and HPs work in our hospital and comment on training, attitudes, care pathways, teamwork, and what needed to be improved. METHODS: A proforma based qualitative study was carried out at the Nurses’ Training Centre of PAF Hospital and Fazaia Medical College, Islamabad, from January to March 2020. After approval, a semi-structured proforma with open and closed ended questions was administered, in English and Urdu. The results were analyzed by comparative numbers and percentages for each question and descriptive responses were grouped in recurring themes and analyzed for content and their constructive value. RESULTS: Out of 85 nursing cadets, the proforma could be administered to 61(M=38(62.3%) and F=23(37.7%). Most were FSc with 26% graduates. Majority of the female students’ main reason for joining was to serve humanity, unlike most males. According to gender many responses were interestingly different. Majority of females thought male doctors were better (86%). Only 36% said the doctors were sincere in care of patients. Most thought that we needed to improve patient counseling. Most thought the seniors treated them unfairly, but bullying was negligible. They wanted the senior HPs to improve their attitudes and ensure adequate equipment in the wards. They were worried about personal security from patients and relatives. Dedicated mental health services to deal with stress of witnessing every day misery and death was suggested. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors need to improve their counseling skills and should talk more to the patients and their relatives. They should acknowledge the nursing students and improve teamwork. Belittling them in front of others harms their self-efficacy. Simple corrections like punctuality, ownership of their patients and improvement of equipment and systems can improve patient care.","Safdar, Sachal Aqeel; Zafar, Humaira; Ahmad, Jawwad; Qayyum, Rashid; Naseem, Sajid; Safdar, Chaudhry Aqeel",Pak J Med Sci,206,1

We report an analysis of 3D‐DS in bovine seminal ribonuclease, a homodimeric protein whose subunits are linked by two disulfide bridges, based on NMR and biochemical studies. The presence of the covalent bonds between the subunits stabilizes the unswapped dimer, and allows distinct evaluation of the structural and dynamic effects of the swapping with respect to the dimerization process. In comparison with the monomeric subunit, which, in solution has a compact structure without any propensity for local unfolding, both swapped and unswapped dimers show increased flexibility. NMR analysis, together with urea denaturation and hydrogen–deuterium exchange data, indicates that the two dimers have increased conformational fluctuations. Furthermore, we found that the rate‐limiting step of both the swapping and unswapping pathways is the detachment of the N‐terminal helices from the monomers. These results suggest a new general mechanism in which a dimeric intermediate could facilitate 3D‐DS in globular proteins.

This motif is missing from the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), resulting in high level of surface expression of the spike protein when it is expressed on its own in vitro. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: It has been shown that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus genome contains open reading frames that encode for proteins with no homologue in other coronaviruses. One of them is the 3a protein, which is expressed during infection in vitro and in vivo. The 3a protein, which contains a tyrosine-dependent sorting signal in its cytoplasmic domain, is expressed on the cell surface and can undergo internalization. In addition, 3a can bind to the spike protein and through this interaction, it may be able to cause the spike protein to become internalized, resulting in a decrease in its surface expression. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: The effects of 3a on the internalization of cell surface spike protein can be examined biochemically and the significance of the interplay between these two viral proteins during viral infection can be studied using reverse genetics methodology. IMPLICATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: If this hypothesis is proven, it will indicate that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus modulates the surface expression of the spike protein via a different mechanism from other coronaviruses. The interaction between 3a and S, which are expressed from separate subgenomic RNA, would be important for controlling the trafficking properties of S. The cell surface expression of S in infected cells significantly impacts viral assembly, viral spread and viral pathogenesis. Modulation by this unique pathway could confer certain advantages during the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus.","Tan, Yee-Joo",Virol J,206,1

Yet, it is unknown to what degree these risk factors alone or in combination can accurately predict who is most at risk. It is also worthwhile to consider serological antibody titers to non COVID-19 infectious diseases, which may influence host immunity to COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective study of multicenter UK Biobank participants, as of May 26(th) 2020, all COVID-19 testing data was collected by Public Health England for older adult in- and out-patients (69.6 ± 8.8 years). We used linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation and bootstrapping to determine the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of baseline data from 2006–2010 to predict COVID-19 infection and presumptive severity (i.e., testing at hospital). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to derive the area under the curve (AUC). FINDINGS: This retrospective study included 4,510 unique participants and 7,539 testing instances (i.e., test cases). Testing resulted in 5,329 negative cases and 2,210 positive cases, split into 996 mild and 1,214 severe disease outcomes. Baseline data including demographics, bioimpedance-derived body composition, vitals, serum biochemistry, self-reported illness/disability, and complete blood count. A randomized subset of 80 participants with 124 test cases also had antibody titers for 20 common to rare infectious diseases. Among all test cases, accuracy was modest for final diagnostic models of COVID-19 infection (70.2%; AUC=0.570, CI=0.556–0.584) and severity (58.3%; AUC=0.592, CI=0.568–0.615). In the serology sub-group, by contrast, final models predicted infection and severity with an accuracy of 93.5% (AUC=0.969, CI=0.934–1.000) and 74.4% (AUC=0.803, CI=0.663–0.943) respectively. Models included titers to common pathogens (e.g., human cytomegalovirus), age, blood cell counts, lipids, and other biochemical markers. INTERPRETATION: Risk profiles including serological titers and other risk factors could help policy makers and clinicians better identify who may get COVID-19 and require hospitalization.","Willette, AA; Willette, SA; Wang, Q; Pappas, C; Klinedinst, BS; Le, S; Larsen, B; Pollpeter, A; Brenner, N; Waterboer, T",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,206,28

DESIGN: : Cross-sectional study. METHODS: : We conducted a telephone survey and interview of a random sample of patients who received different modalities of care (in-person, telephone, videocall, or visits deferred) during Michigan's shelter-in-place order beginning March 23(rd), 2020. The survey assessed patient safety, patient satisfaction with care, perceptions of telehealth-based eye care, and worry about eyesight. Data was analyzed via frequency measures (e.g., means and standard deviations), Chi-square tests, ANOVA, and paired t-tests. Interviews were analyzed using Grounded Theory. RESULTS: : 3274 patients were called and 1720 (53%) agreed to participate. In-person participants were significantly older than telephone (p=0.002) and videocall visit (p=0.001) participants. Significantly more white participants had in-person visits than minority participants (p=0.002). In-person visit participants worried about their eyesight more (2.7, SD=1.2) than those who had telephone (2.5, SD 1.3), videocall (2.4, SD=1.1), or deferred visits (2.4, SD=1.2) (p=0.004). Of all telephone or videocall visits, 1.5% (n=26) resulted in an in-person visit within 1 day, 2.9% (n=48) within 2-7 days, and 2.4% (n=40) within 8-14 days after the virtual visit demonstrating appropriate triage to telemedicine-based care. Patients frequently cited a desire for augmenting the telephone or videocall visits with objective test data. CONCLUSIONS: : When appropriately triaged, tele-ophthalmology appears to be a safe way to reduce the volume of in-person visits to promote social distancing in the clinic. A hybrid model of eye care combining ancillary testing with a video or phone visit represents a promising model of care.","Newman-Casey, Paula Anne; De Lott, Lindsey; Cho, Juno; Ballouz, Dena; Azzouz, Lyna; Saleh, Sahal; Woodward, Maria A.",Am J Ophthalmol,206,30

The main characteristics of the virus are rapid transmission, high contagion capacity and potential severity. The objective of this case series study is to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) admitted to different intensive care units in Argentina for mechanical ventilation. METHODS: A descriptive, prospective, multicenter case series study was conducted between April 1 and May 8, 2020. Data from patients older than 18 years who were admitted to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: The variables for 47 patients from 31 intensive care units were recorded: 78.7% were men (median age of 61 years), with a SAPS II score of 43 and a Charlson index score of 3. The initial ventilatory mode was volume control - continuous mandatory ventilation with a tidal volume less than 8mL/kg in 100% of cases, with a median positive end-expiratory pressure of 10.5cmH(2)O.

Proper guidance for and refinement of such methods is continuously required. Here, we report on the educational experience students and academic staff at the neurosurgical department of a German university hospital made with digital teaching modules (DTMs) that were newly developed due to the transition to digital teaching during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and on the insights gained therefrom. Methods: Nine newly created DTMs provided students the option to anonymously evaluate each module by assigning a score from 0 (worst value) to 5 (best value) to it. Access count, evaluation count, average evaluation, number of included (interactive) figures, number of presented cases, number of linked publications, and number of included multiple-choice questions for each DTM were recorded retrospectively. For each DTM, we aimed to correlate access count, evaluation count, and average evaluation with the number of included (interactive) figures, number of presented cases, number of linked publications, and number of included multiple-choice questions. E-mail responses from individual students as to the DTMs were collected. Among students, an anonymous, voluntary online survey regarding the DTMs was conducted. Results: Number of figures and average evaluation per DTM were significantly positively correlated (Spearman’s rho = 0.85; p = 0.0037). Number of figures and number of evaluations per DTM were also significantly positively correlated (Spearman’s rho = 0.78; p = 0.0137). Responses from individual students indicated that illustrative cases and interactive figures might further increase DTM popularity. Conclusion: As a valuable adjunct in medical student education, DTMs should contain (interactive) figures, illustrative cases, a scoring option, and the option to give individual feedback towards the academic staff.","Rupa, Rosita; Pojskic, Mirza; Nimsky, Christopher; Voellger, Benjamin",Healthcare (Basel),206,1

Here, we leverage ~1.1 million clinical notes from 1803 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and deep neural network models to characterize associations between 21 pre-existing conditions and the development of 20 complications (e.g. respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, and hematologic) of COVID-19 infection throughout the course of infection (i.e. 0–30 days, 31–60 days, and 61–90 days). Pleural effusion was the most frequent complication of early COVID-19 infection (89/1803 patients, 4.9%) followed by cardiac arrhythmia (45/1803 patients, 2.5%). Notably, hypertension was the most significant risk factor associated with 10 different complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia, and anemia. The onset of new complications after 30 days is rare and most commonly involves pleural effusion (31–60 days: 11 patients, 61–90 days: 9 patients). Lastly, comparing the rates of complications with a propensity-matched COVID-negative hospitalized population confirmed the importance of hypertension as a risk factor for early-onset complications.

The first test employs a one‐step, reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) assay in which the amplification is monitored in real time using a TaqMan(®) probe. This real‐time RT‐PCR test was used to examine a panel of field samples and its performance compared to virus isolation in embryonated fowls’ eggs. A total of 323 field samples were tested; 176 samples were positive using the real‐time RT‐PCR method, but only three were positive by virus isolation. Sequencing was used to confirm the positive real‐time RT‐PCR results for a subset of samples. The test is suitable for swabs and post‐mortem samples and has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific. The second test, a genotyping method, was developed for identification of the strain of IBV present in field samples based on nucleotide variations within the gene encoding the S1 subunit of the surface spike (S) glycoprotein. This method was developed to provide a tool to inform vaccination decisions and for ongoing surveillance to detect new and emerging strains of IBV within the UK. The performance of the test was evaluated using laboratory isolates of IBV and field samples. Both tests are suitable for use in a high‐throughput diagnostic laboratory.","Jones, R. M.; Ellis, R.

The role of vitamin and mineral supplementation or “immunonutrition” has previously been explored in a number of clinical trials in intensive care settings, and there are several hypotheses to support their routine use. The aim of this narrative review was to investigate whether vitamin supplementation is beneficial in COVID-19. A systematic search strategy with a narrative literature summary was designed, using the Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Trials Register, WHO International Clinical Trial Registry, and Nexis media databases. The immune-mediating, antioxidant and antimicrobial roles of vitamins A to E were explored and their potential role in the fight against COVID-19 was evaluated. The major topics extracted for narrative synthesis were physiological and immunological roles of each vitamin, their role in respiratory infections, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and COVID-19. Vitamins A to E highlighted potentially beneficial roles in the fight against COVID-19 via antioxidant effects, immunomodulation, enhancing natural barriers, and local paracrine signaling. Level 1 and 2 evidence supports the use of thiamine, vitamin C, and vitamin D in COVID-like respiratory diseases, ARDS, and sepsis. Although there are currently no published clinical trials due to the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is pathophysiologic rationale for exploring the use of vitamins in this global pandemic, supported by early anecdotal reports from international groups. The final outcomes of ongoing trials of vitamin supplementation are awaited with interest.","Jovic, Thomas H; Ali, Stephen R; Ibrahim, Nader; Jessop, Zita M; Tarassoli, Sam P; Dobbs, Thomas D; Holford, Patrick; Thornton, Catherine A; Whitaker, Iain S",Nutrients,206,1

Some governments have resisted such measures in the hope that naturally acquired shield immunity could slow the spread of the virus. In the absence of empirical data about the effectiveness of these measures, policymakers must turn to epidemiological modelling to evaluate options for responding to the pandemic. This paper combines compartmental epidemiological models with the concept of behavioural dynamics from evolutionary game theory (EGT). This innovation allows us to model how compliance with an economic lockdown might wane over time, as individuals weigh the risk of infection against the certainty of the economic cost of staying at home. Governments can, however, increase spending on social programmes to mitigate the cost of a shutdown. Numerical analysis of our model suggests that emergency-relief funds spent at the individual level are effective in reducing the duration and overall economic cost of a pandemic. We also find that shield immunity takes hold in a population most easily when a lockdown is enacted with relatively low costs to the individual. Our qualitative analysis of a complex model provides evidence that the effects of shield immunity and economic shutdowns are complementary, such that governments should pursue them in tandem.","Kabir, K.

Methods: 64 older women (age = 72{+/-}5 ys) who participated in a physical exercise/educational program and adhered to government home confinement recommendations have their levels of physical activity, sedentary behavior and HRQL assessed before and during (11 to 13 weeks after introduction of government recommendations to reduce virus transmission) COVID-19 pandemic. Results: There were significant reductions in total physical activity (-259 METs/week, P = 0.02), as a result of a ~17.0 % reduction in walking (-30.8 min/week, P = 0.004) and ~41.8 % reduction in vigorous-intensity activity (-29.6 min/week, P < 0.001).

This resource is considered safe and effective and has attracted an exponential interest in the context of the COVID pandemic. Expanded to dizzy patients, it would be able to provide diagnosis and treatment, minimizing the risk of disease transmission. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder. The diagnosis typically rests on the description of the symptoms along with the nystagmus observed at a well-established positional testing. Objectives The aim of the present study was to propose a teleconsultation and teletreatment protocol to manage patients with BPPV during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Specialists in the vestibular field met through remote access technologies to discuss the best strategy to manage BPPV patients by teleconsultation and teletreatment system. Additionally, several scientific sources were consulted. Technical issues, patient safety, and clinical assessment were independently analyzed. All relevant information was considered in order to design a clinical protocol to manage BPPV patients in the pandemic context. Results Teleconsultation for BPPV patients requires a double way (video and audio) digital system. An adapted informed consent to follow good clinical practice statements must be considered. The time, trigger and target eye bedside examination (TiTRaTe) protocol has proven to be a valuable first approach. The bow and lean test is the most rational screening maneuver for patients with suspected positional vertigo, followed by most specific maneuvers to diagnostic the sub-variants of BPPV. Conclusion Although with limited evidence, teleconsultation and teletreatment are both reasonable and feasible strategies for the management of patients with BPPV in adverse situations for face-to-face consultation.","Barreto, Renato Gonzaga; Yacovino, Darío Andrés; Teixeira, Lázaro Juliano; Freitas, Mayanna Machado",Int Arch Otorhinolaryngol,206,30

METHODS: All adult patients who were treated at our center were asked to report on their vaccination status and, if vaccinated, about their experiences following their first COVID-19 vaccination with regard to adverse effects and seizure control. RESULTS: Fifty-four PWE have already received their first vaccination against COVID-19 (27 female, 20% seizure free, 96<% on antiseizure medication) and were included in the study. Two-thirds tolerated the vaccines generally either very well or well. Thirty-three percent reported general vaccination adverse effects. The most frequently reported general adverse effects were, in descending order, headache, fatigue and fever, and shivering. With regard to epilepsy-related adverse effects, one patient reported increased seizure frequency one day after the first COVID-19 vaccination was administered, and one reported the occurrence of a new seizure type. None of the patients reported a status epilepticus or aggravation of preexisting adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that vaccination against COVID-19 appears to be well tolerated in PWE, supporting the recommendation of vaccination to PWE.","von Wrede, Randi; Pukropski, Jan; Moskau-Hartmann, Susanna; Surges, Rainer; Baumgartner, Tobias",Epilepsy Behav,206,24

Spirometry was performed and sputum specimens were tested for a range of 12 different respiratory viruses using PCR. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six patients with exacerbations of COPD, 68 stable COPD patients and 16 non-obstructed smokers were recruited. A respiratory virus was detected in 37% of exacerbations, 12% of stable COPD patients and 12% of non-obstructed smokers, p < 0.0005. Rhinovirus was most frequently detected. The symptom of fever was associated with virus detection, p < 0.05. Infection with more than one virus was only found in the exacerbated COPD patients. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral infection is associated with exacerbations of COPD. Rhinovirus was the most common infecting agent identified and in two cases human metapneumovirus was also detected. Dual infections were only seen amongst those patients admitted to hospital with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Aerosols of PRRS virus were exposed to one of four doses of UV(254) under nine combinations of temperature (n = 3) and relative humidity (n = 3). Inactivation constants (k), defined as the absolute value of the slope of the linear relationship between the survival fraction of the microbial population and the UV(254) exposure dose, were estimated using the random coefficient model. The associated UV(254) half-life dose for each combination of environmental factors was determined as (log(10) 2/k) and expressed as UV(254) mJ per unit volume. The effects of UV(254) dose, temperature, and relative humidity were all statistically significant, as were the interactions between UV(254) dose × temperature and UV(254) dose × relative humidity. PRRS virus was more susceptible to ultraviolet as temperature decreased; most susceptible to ultraviolet inactivation at relative humidity between 25% and 79%, less susceptible at relative humidity ≤24%, and least susceptible at ≥80% relative humidity.

We evaluated the anti-T. gondii effects of ursolic acid, and analyzed the production of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cytokines through co-cultured immune cells, as well as the expression of intracellular organelles of T. gondii. The subcellular organelles and granules of T. gondii, particularly rhoptry protein 18, microneme protein 8, and inner membrane complex sub-compartment protein 3, were markedly decreased when T. gondii was treated with ursolic acid, and their expressions were effectively inhibited. Furthermore, ursolic acid effectively increased the production of NO, ROS, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon-β, while reducing the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) in T. gondii-infected immune cells. These results demonstrate that ursolic acid not only causes anti-T. gondii activity/action by effectively inhibiting the survival of T. gondii and the subcellular organelles of T. gondii, but also induces specific immunomodulatory effects in T. gondii-infected immune cells. Therefore, this study indicates that ursolic acid can be effectively utilized as a potential candidate agent for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis drugs, and has immunomodulatory activity.","Choi, Won Hyung; Lee, In Ah",Pathogens,206,17

The IBD cohort consisted of 1453 patients (51% Crohn’s disease, 54% women, 39.9% using immunotherapy), including children. Biologics use increased during the study. Eight cases (0.55%) had severe COVID-19: seven were hospitalized (0.48%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21–1.04), and two died (0.14%, CI 0.002–0.55). Six patients had comorbidity, one used immunotherapy, and four had no medication. Both deceased patients were older than 80 years, had severe comorbidity, but used no immunotherapy. Hospitalization occurred significantly more in the IBD cohort than regionally (0.18%, CI 0.17–0.19, p = 0.015), but not significantly more than nationally (0.28%, CI 0.279–0.284). Mortality was equal in IBD patients, regionally (0.11%, CI 0.10–0.12) and nationally (0.13%, CI 0.125–0.128). Neither IBD nor immunosuppressants are associated with increased risks of severe COVID-19 in an observational study with one-year follow-up.","Gilissen, Lennard P. L.; Heinen, Stefan G.

METHODS: A join-count spatial statistic study was conducted and the given hypothetical processes of the spread of SARS in Beijing were tested using various definitions of ‘joins’. RESULTS: The spatial statistics showed that of the six diffusion processes, the highest negative autocorrelation occurred in the doctor-number model (M-5) and the lowest negative autocorrelation was found in the population-amount model (M-3). The results also showed that in the whole 29-day research period, about hour or more days experienced a significant degree of contagion. CONCLUSIONS: Spatial analysis is helpful in understanding the spatial diffusion process of an epidemic. The geographical relationships were important during the early phase of the SARS epidemic in Beijing. The statistic based on the number of doctors was significant and more informative than that of the number of hospitals. It reveals that doctors were important in the spread of SARS in Beijing, and hospitals were not as important as doctors in the contagion period. People are the key to the spread of SARS, but the population density was more significant than the population size, although they were both important throughout the whole period.","Meng, B.; Wang, J.; Liu, J.; Wu, J.; Zhong, E.",Public Health,206,16

The full-length genome was 28,038 nucleotides (nt) in length without the poly (A) tail, and it was similar to that of other reported PEDV strains, with the characteristic gene order 5′-replicase (1a/1b) -S-ORF3-E-M-N-3′. Nucleotide sequence analysis based on individual virus genes indicated a close relationship between the S gene of SHQP/YM/2013 and those of the four Korean field strains from 2008–2009. Its ORF3 gene, however, fell into three groups. Recent prevalent Chinese PEDV field isolates were divided between group 1 and group 3, which suggests that the recent prevalent Chinese PEDV field isolates represent a new genotype that differs from the genotype that includes the vaccine strains. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the M gene, ORF3 gene and S gene, our study demonstrated that prevalent PEDV isolates in China may have originated from Korean strains. This report describes the complete genome sequence of SHQP/YM/2013, and the data will promote a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of PEDV field isolates in eastern China.","Yang, De-Quan; Ge, Fei-Fei; Ju, Hou-Bin; Wang, Jian; Liu, Jian; Ning, Kun; Liu, Pei-Hong; Zhou, Jin-Ping; Sun, Quan-Yun",Arch Virol,206,16

Employment and economic uncertainty, chronic stress, anxiety, and social isolation are likely to have negative impacts on parent mental health, couple and family relationships, as well as child health and development. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to: (1) provide timely information on the mental health impacts of the emerging COVID-19 crisis in a close to representative sample of Australian parents and children (0–18 years), (2) identify adults and families most at risk of poor mental health outcomes, and (3) identify factors to target through clinical and public health intervention to reduce risk. Specifically, this study will investigate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased risk for parents’ mental health, lower well-being, loneliness, and alcohol use; parent-parent and parent-child relationships (both verbal and physical); and child and adolescent mental health problems. METHODS: The study aims to recruit a close to representative sample of at least 2,000 adults aged 18 years and over living in Australia who are parents of a child 0–4 years (early childhood, N = 400), 5–12 years (primary school N = 800), and 13–18 years (secondary school, N = 800). The design will be a longitudinal cohort study using an online recruitment methodology. Participants will be invited to complete an online baseline self-report survey (20 min) followed by a series of shorter online surveys (10 min) scheduled every 2 weeks for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., estimated to be 14 surveys over 6 months). RESULTS: The study will employ post stratification weights to address differences between the final sample and the national population in geographic communities across Australia. Associations will be analyzed using multilevel modeling with time-variant and time-invariant predictors of change in trajectory over the testing period. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide timely information on the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on parents and children in Australia; identify communities, parents, families, and children most at risk of poor outcomes; and identify potential factors to address in clinical and public health interventions to reduce risk.","Westrupp, Elizabeth M.; Karantzas, Gery; Macdonald, Jacqui A.; Olive, Lisa; Youssef, George; Greenwood, Christopher J.; Sciberras, Emma; Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, Matthew; Evans, Subhadra; Mikocka-Walus, Antonina; Ling, Mathew; Cummins, Robert; Hutchinson, Delyse; Melvin, Glenn; Fernando, Julian W.; Teague, Samantha; Wood, Amanda G.; Toumbourou, John W.; Berkowitz, Tomer; Linardon, Jake; Enticott, Peter G.; Stokes, Mark A.; McGillivray, Jane; Olsson, Craig A.",Front Psychiatry,206,19

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) formulated and established laboratory surveillance for COVID-19. In this study, an analysis of the surveillance data was done to describe the testing performance and descriptive epidemiology of COVID-19 cases by time, place and person. METHODS: The data were extracted from January 22 to April 30, 2020. The frequencies of testing performance were described over time and by place. We described cases by time (epidemic curve by date of specimen collection; seven-day moving average), place (area map) and person (attack rate by age, sex and contact status), and trends were represented along with public health measures and events. RESULTS: Between January 22 and April 30, 2020, a total of 1,021,518 individuals were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Testing increased from about 250 individuals per day in the beginning of March to 50,000 specimens per day by the end of April 2020. Overall, 40,184 (3.9%) tests were reported positive. The proportion of positive cases was highest among symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts, 2-3-fold higher than among those with severe acute respiratory infection, or those with an international travel history or healthcare workers. The attack rate (per million) by age was highest among those aged 50-69 yr (63.3) and was lowest among those under 10 yr (6.1). The attack rate was higher among males (41.6) than females (24.3). The secondary attack rate was 6.0 per cent. Overall, 99.0 per cent of 736 districts reported testing and 71.1 per cent reported COVID-19 cases. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The coverage and frequency of ICMR's laboratory surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 improved over time. COVID-19 was reported from most parts of India, and the attack rate was more among men and the elderly and common among close contacts. Analysis of the data indicates that for further insight, additional surveillance tools and strategies at the national and sub-national levels are needed.","Abraham, Priya; Aggarwal, Neeraj; Babu, Giridhara R.; Barani, Suganya; Bhargava, Balram; Bhatnagar, Tarun; Dhama, Ajay Singh; Gangakhedkar, Raman R.; Giri, Sidhartha; Gupta, Nivedita; Kurup, Karishma K.; Manickam, Ponnaiah; Murhekar, Manoj; Potdar, Varsha; Praharaj, Ira; Rade, Kiran; Reddy, D.C.S.; Saravanakumar, V.; Shah, Naman; Singh, Harpreet; Thangaraj, Jeromie Wesley Vivian; Yadav, Naveen",Indian J Med Res,206,1

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown on this population through the lens of users of the UK National Health Service–approved pregnancy and parenting smartphone app, Baby Buddy. The study aims were threefold: to gain insights into the attitudes and experiences of expectant and recent parents (with babies under 24 weeks of age) during the COVID-19 pandemic; to investigate whether Baby Buddy is meeting users’ needs during this time; and to identify ways to revise the content of Baby Buddy to better support its users now and in future. METHODS: A mixed methods study design combining a web-based survey with semistructured telephone interviews among Baby Buddy users in the United Kingdom was applied. Data were collected from April 15 to mid-June 2020, corresponding to weeks 4-13 of the lockdown in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: A total of 436 expectant (n=244, 56.0%) and recent (n=192, 44.0%) parents responded to the web-based survey, of which 79.1% (n=345) were aged 25-39 years and 17.2% (n=75) spoke English as their second language. Of the 436 respondents, 88.5% (386/436) reported increased levels of anxiety around pregnancy, birth, and being a new parent, and 58.0% (253/436) were concerned about their emotional and mental health. Of the 244 pregnant respondents, 43.4% (n=106) were concerned about their physical health. Telephone interviews with 13 pregnant women and 19 recent parents revealed similarly increased levels of anxiety due to reduced health care provision and loss of support from friends and family. Although a minority of respondents identified some positive outcomes of lockdown, such as family bonding, many telephone interviewees reported feeling isolated, disregarded, and overwhelmed. Recent parents were particularly anxious about the impact of the lockdown on their baby’s development and socialization. Many interviewees were also concerned about their physical health as a consequence of both limited access to face-to-face medical appointments and their own poorer dietary and physical activity behaviors. Across both samples, 97.0% (423/436) of respondents reported that Baby Buddy was currently helping them, with many commenting that its role was even more important given the lack of face-to-face support from health care and parenting organizations. Greater speed in updating digital content to reflect changes due to the pandemic was suggested. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has created heightened anxiety and stress among expectant parents and those with a young baby, and for many, lockdown has had an adverse impact on their physical and mental well-being. With reductions in health care and social support, expectant and new parents are increasingly relying on web-based resources. As a free, evidence-based app, Baby Buddy is well positioned to meet this need. The app could support its users even more by actively directing them to the wealth of existing content relevant to their concerns and by adding content to give users the knowledge and confidence to meet new challenges.","Rhodes, Alexandra; Kheireddine, Sara; Smith, Andrea D",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,206,1

Quantification by RT-qPCR (ORF1b) led to 11 positive samples from 6 patient rooms (C(t) < 40). Viral cultures were negative. No correlation was observed between particular symptoms, length of hospital stay, clinical parameters, and time since symptom onset and the detection of airborne viral RNA. Low detection rates in the hospital rooms may be attributable to the appropriate application of mitigation methods according to the risk control hierarchy, such as increased ventilation to 4.85 air changes per hour to create negative pressure rooms. Our work estimates the mean emission rate of patients and potential airborne concentration in the absence of ventilation.

Apart from nicotine or other chemicals contained in tobacco smoke, we propose that a single-stranded RNA virus that infects tobacco leaves, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), might be implicated in this effect. TMV, though non-pathogenic, is found in smokers’ airways, and stimulates adaptive and innate immunity, with release of specific antibodies and interferons. The latter may have preventive and/or therapeutic effects against COVID-19.

The health-care workers (HCWs), hospital administrators, government leaders, and public health officials all rushed to coordinate and contain its global spread. Early on, it became clear that the virus was highly contagious and had a longer latent (yet transmissible) period when compared with previous pandemics. During the early dynamics in Wuhan, China, the basic reproductive number (R(0)) was 2.2–2.7, suggesting a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6–7 days. The spread of the disease has been further exacerbated by limitations in testing and medical supplies, disconcerting guidelines, conflicting media information, and whether policies are instituted and enforced to attempt to “flatten the curve” as well as the timeliness of health-related political efforts. At the same time, a swarming number of fast-track publications and interventions overwhelmed frontline HCWs with excessive and misrepresented study conclusions that needed to be implemented at the bedside. Some high-profile publications were even retracted limiting further therapeutic options. Facing these uncertainties, HCWs have been battling with immense physical and psychological stress from a surge of clinical work, staff shortage, bed crunch, potential lack of personal protective equipment and drugs, and profound ethical conflicts. Above all, HCWs grapple with the risks that exposure to the virus could have not only for themselves but for their families. The International Council of Nursing reported an estimate of 230,000 infected HCWs and over 600 nurses died based on information collected on 30 countries from national nursing associations, government figures, and media reports in June 2020.

Development of animal models that recapitulate important aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for the evaluation of vaccines and antivirals, and understanding disease pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV-1, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)(1–3). Due to amino acid differences between murine and hACE2, inbred mouse strains fail to support high titer viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, a number of transgenic and knock-in mouse models, as well as viral vector-mediated hACE2 delivery systems have been developed. Here we compared the K18-hACE2 transgenic model to adenovirus-mediated delivery of hACE2 to the mouse lung. We show that K18-hACE2 mice replicate virus to high titers in both the lung and brain leading to lethality. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated delivery results in viral replication to lower titers limited to the lung, and no clinical signs of infection with a challenge dose of 10(4) plaque forming units. The K18-hACE2 model provides a stringent model for testing the ability of vaccines and antivirals to protect against disease, whereas the adenovirus delivery system has the flexibility to be used across multiple genetic backgrounds and modified mouse strains.","Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Strohmeier, Shirin; Amanat, Fatima; Gillespie, Virginia L.; Krammer, Florian; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Coughlan, Lynda; Schotsaert, Michael; Uccellini, Melissa",bioRxiv,206,16

SETTING: All English ambulance services, UK. DESIGN: We used a time series design analysing published monthly National Health Service staff sickness rates by gender, age, job role and region, comparing the 10 regional ambulance services in England between 2009 and 2018. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models were developed using Stata V.14.2 and trends displayed graphically. PARTICIPANTS: Individual participant data were not available. The total number of full-time equivalent (FTE) days lost due to sickness absence (including non-working days) and total number of days available for work for each staff group and level were available. In line with The Data Protection Act, if the organisation had less than 330 FTE days available during the study period it was censored for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1117 months of sickness absence rate data for all English ambulance services were included in the analysis. We found considerable variation in annual sickness absence rates between ambulance services and over the 10-year duration of the study in England. Across all the ambulance services the median days available were 1 336 888 with IQR of 548 796 and 73 346 median days lost due to sickness absence, with IQR of 30 551 days. Among clinical staff sickness absence varied seasonally with peaks in winter and falls over summer. The winter increases in sickness absence were largely predictable using seasonally adjusted (SARIMA) time series models. CONCLUSION: Sickness rates for clinical staff were found to vary considerably over time and by ambulance trust. Statistical models had sufficient predictive capability to help forecast sickness absence, enabling services to plan human resources more effectively at times of increased demand.","Asghar, Zahid B; Wankhade, Paresh; Bell, Fiona; Sanderson, Kristy; Hird, Kelly; Phung, Viet-Hai; Siriwardena, Aloysius Niroshan",BMJ Open,206,16

However, the impact that these environmental parameters have on survival of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has not been fully characterised. Therefore an analytical study was undertaken using published data to develop a psychrometric model to predict the biological decay rate of the virus in aerosols. This revealed that it is possible to predict with a high degree of accuracy (R2 = 0.718, p<0.001) the biological decay constant for SARS-CoV-2 using a regression model with enthalpy, vapour pressure and specific volume as predictors. Applying this to historical meteorological data from London, Paris and Milan over the pandemic period, produced results which indicate that the average half-life of the virus in aerosols was in the region 13-21 times longer in March 2020, when the outbreak was accelerating, than it was in August 2020 when epidemic in Europe was at its nadir. As such, this suggests that changes in virus survivability due the variations in the psychrometric qualities of the air might influence the transmission of COVID-19.","Beggs, Clive B; Avital, Eldad J",,206,29

METHODS: We carried out a qualitative case study of one local government region in the North of England (UK), comprising semi structured interviews (n = 16) with service providers with a responsibility for child health, non-participant observations of key meetings (n = 6 with 43 participants) where decisions around child health are made, and a local policy documentation review (n = 11). We employed a novel theoretical framework, drawing together different approaches to understanding policy, to guide our design and analysis. RESULTS: Participants in our study understood inequalities in CYP health almost exclusively as socioeconomically patterned inequalities in health practices and outcomes. Strategies which participants perceived to reduce inequalities included: preventive support and early intervention, an early years/whole family focus, targeted working in local areas of high deprivation, organisational integration and whole system/place-based approaches. Despite demonstrating a commitment to a social determinants of health approach, efforts to reduce inequalities were described as thwarted by the prevalence of poverty and budget cuts which hindered the ability of local organisations to work together. Participants critiqued national policy which aimed to reduce inequalities in CYP health for failing to recognise local economic disparities and the interrelated nature of the determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased calls for a ‘whole systems’ approach to reducing inequalities in health, significant barriers to implementation remain. National governments need to work towards more joined up policy making, which takes into consideration regional disparities, allows for flexibility in interpretation and addresses the different and interrelated social determinants of health. Our findings have particular significance in light of Covid-19 and indicate the need for systems level policy responses and a health in all policies approach.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, related rumors have been widely posted and spread on online social media, which have seriously affected people’s daily lives, national economy, social stability, etc. It is both theoretically and practically essential to detect and refute COVID-19 rumors fast and effectively. As COVID-19 was an emergent event that was outbreaking drastically, the related rumor instances were very scarce and distinct at its early stage. This makes the detection task a typical few-shot learning problem. However, traditional rumor detection techniques focused on detecting existed events with enough training instances, so that they fail to detect emergent events such as COVID-19. Therefore, developing a new few-shot rumor detection framework has become critical and emergent to prevent outbreaking rumors at early stages. METHODS: This article focuses on few-shot rumor detection, especially for detecting COVID-19 rumors from Sina Weibo with only a minimal number of labeled instances. We contribute a Sina Weibo COVID-19 rumor dataset for few-shot rumor detection and propose a few-shot learning-based multi-modality fusion model for few-shot rumor detection. A full microblog consists of the source post and corresponding comments, which are considered as two modalities and fused with the meta-learning methods. RESULTS: Experiments of few-shot rumor detection on the collected Weibo dataset and the PHEME public dataset have shown significant improvement and generality of the proposed model.","Lu, Heng-yang; Fan, Chenyou; Song, Xiaoning; Fang, Wei",PeerJ Comput Sci,206,1

METHODS: A 29-item questionnaire was completed and returned by 154 Otorhinolaryngology Units across Italy that investigated geographic distribution, the main changes which occurred in workload management and in clinical and surgical activities and screening procedures for COVID-19 in healthcare personnel and patients. RESULTS: Nearly half of the Otolaryngology Units that responded to the questionnaire were merged with other units, while 22% were converted into COVID-19 units or temporarily closed. A reduction of 8.55% in the number of team members was reported, and about 50% of the units applied uniform work shifts for all staff. Elective activities were uniformly stopped or delayed, passing from 30,295 (pre-COVID data) to 5,684 (COVID data) weekly procedures, with a mean decrease of 81.24% (p < 0.001).

However, very little attention has focused on capacity building in knowledge necessary for (bio)medical research, specifically around emerging opportunistic human pathogens that contribute to the high morbidity and mortality rates in Sierra Leone. In collaboration with academic staff from the University of Makeni, we engaged in a small-scale pilot intervention to strengthen medical parasitology teaching and research. The cultural competencies and ethical expertise provided by Sierra Leonean academics was critical to work in local communities and ensuring consent to undertake research. Yet, at the end of a day of collecting samples, in small pieces of conversation, the staff also explained ethical constraints they experienced taking part in research collaborations. They illustrate that, while on the surface all may seem well with a project, there can be harmful effects in terms of accessibility, ownership, cultural responsiveness and accountability, which should be taken into consideration when establishing networks and collaborations with universities from low-income countries.","Peña-Fernández, Antonio; Anjum, Umar; Wadoum, Raoul Emeric Guetiya; Koroma, Sylvester; Berghs, Maria",Int Health,206,8

Thirteen Israeli kindred (five Jewish and eight Arab) and two isolated cases from Germany were studied between the years 1997 and 2013. Four and a branch of a fifth of these families were previously described. Here, we reported the demographic, clinical, molecular and biochemical characterizations of the remaining cases. Seven out of 20 affected individuals (35%) presented with xanthinuria-related symptoms of varied severity. Among the 10 distinct variants identified, six were novel: c.449G>T (p.(Cys150Phe)), c.1434G>A (p.(Trp478*)), c.1871C>G (p.(Ser624*)) and c.913del (p.(Leu305fs*1)) in the XDH gene and c.1046C>T (p.(Thr349Ileu)) and c.1771C>T (p.(Pro591Ser)) in the MOCOS gene. Heterologous protein expression studies revealed that the p.Cys150Phe variant within the Fe/S-I cluster-binding site impairs XDH biogenesis, the p.Thr349Ileu variant in the NifS-like domain of MOCOS affects protein stability and cysteine desulfurase activity, while the p.Pro591Ser and a previously described p.Arg776Cys variant in the C-terminal domain affect Molybdenum cofactor binding. Based on the results of haplotype analyses and historical genealogy findings, the potential dispersion of the identified variants is discussed. As far as we are aware, this is the largest cohort of xanthinuria cases described so far, substantially expanding the repertoire of pathogenic variants, characterizing structurally and functionally essential amino acid residues in the XDH and MOCOS proteins and addressing the population genetic aspects of classical xanthinuria.","Peretz, Hava; Lagziel, Ayala; Bittner, Florian; Kabha, Mustafa; Shtauber-Naamati, Meirav; Zhuravel, Vicki; Usher, Sali; Rump, Steffen; Wollers, Silke; Bork, Bettina; Mandel, Hanna; Falik-Zaccai, Tzipora; Kalfon, Limor; Graessler, Juergen; Zeharia, Avraham; Heib, Nasser; Shalev, Hannah; Landau, Daniel; Levartovsky, David",Biomedicines,206,20

METHODS: In this randomized, multicenter, single-blind trial, we assigned patients who were being treated in an emergency department for Covid-19 symptoms to receive either one unit of convalescent plasma with a high titer of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or placebo. All the patients were either 50 years of age or older or had one or more risk factors for disease progression. In addition, all the patients presented to the emergency department within 7 days after symptom onset and were in stable condition for outpatient management. The primary outcome was disease progression within 15 days after randomization, which was a composite of hospital admission for any reason, seeking emergency or urgent care, or death without hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included the worst severity of illness on an 8-category ordinal scale, hospital-free days within 30 days after randomization, and death from any cause. RESULTS: A total of 511 patients were enrolled in the trial (257 in the convalescent-plasma group and 254 in the placebo group). The median age of the patients was 54 years; the median symptom duration was 4 days. In the donor plasma samples, the median titer of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies was 1:641. Disease progression occurred in 77 patients (30.0%) in the convalescent-plasma group and in 81 patients (31.9%) in the placebo group (risk difference, 1.9 percentage points; 95% credible interval, −6.0 to 9.8; posterior probability of superiority of convalescent plasma, 0.68). Five patients in the plasma group and 1 patient in the placebo group died. Outcomes regarding worst illness severity and hospital-free days were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of Covid-19 convalescent plasma to high-risk outpatients within 1 week after the onset of symptoms of Covid-19 did not prevent disease progression.

A new entity of the disease, Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (KDSS), is defined as a KD patient presenting with signs of hypoperfusion. Our aim is to describe the signs and symptoms of KDSS and how it is treated and its consequences. Out of 37 patients diagnosed with KD in the period between January 2018 and December 2019 in hospitalized patients younger than 14 years of age at Maternity and Children's Hospital in Al-Hassa, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia, 3 (8.10%) patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for KDSS: 2 (66%) were male and 1 (33%) was female. The cardinal feature in all of them was peripheral cardiovascular collapse. Two patients (66%) were found to have aseptic meningitis. All patients were treated with immunomodulatory agents (intravenous immunoglobulin) and all responded well to anti-inflammatory doses of aspirin. KDSS is the shock state of KD presenting with hypoperfusion symptoms, mainly irritability and changes in the level of consciousness and peripheral cardiovascular collapse.

Its mortality rate is significantly higher than that of non-rifampicin/multidrug-resistant tuberculous meningitis (NRR/MDR-TBM). This article aimed to explore risk factors related to RR/MDR-TBM, and compare therapeutic effects of linezolid (LZD)- and non-linezolid-containing regimen for RR/MDR-TB patients in Shenzhen city. Furthermore, we aimed to find a better therapy for pathogen-negative TBM with RR/MDR-TBM related risk factors. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study enrolling 137 hospitalized cases with confirmed TBM from June 2014 to March 2020. All patients were divided into RR/MDR-TBM group (12 cases) and NRR/MDR-TBM group (125 cases) based on GeneXpert MTB/RIF and (or) phenotypic drug susceptibility test results using cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). The risk factors related to RR/MDR-TBM were investigated through comparing clinical and examination features between the two groups. The mortality rate of RR/MDR-TBM patients treated with different regimens was analyzed to compare their respective therapeutic effects. A difference of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Most patients (111/137, 81%) were from southern or southwestern China, and a large proportion (72/137, 52.55%) belonged to migrant workers. 12 cases were RR/MDR-TBM (12/137, 8.8%) while 125 cases were NRR/MDR-TBM (125/137, 91.2%). The proportion of patients having prior TB treatment history in the RR/MDR-TBM group was significantly higher than that of the NRR/MDR-TBM group (6/12 vs. 12/125, 50% vs. 10.5%, P < 0.01). No significant difference was observed on other clinical and examination features between the two groups. Mortality was significantly lower in RR/MDR-TBM patients on linezolid-containing treatment regimen than those who were not (0/7 versus 3/5, 0% versus 60%, P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: The main related risk factor of RR/MDR-TBM is the history of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Linezolid-containing regimen appears to lower mortality rate of RR/MDR-TBM significantly in our study. We think Linezolid should be evaluated prospectively in the treatment of RR/MDR-TBM.","Fang, Mu-Tong; Su, You-Feng; An, Hui-Ru; Zhang, Pei-Ze; Deng, Guo-Fang; Liu, Hou-Ming; Mao, Zhi; Zeng, Jian-Feng; Li, Guobao; Yang, Qian-Ting; Wang, Zhong-Yuan",BMC Infect Dis,206,16

Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 among military personnel serve as biomarkers of infection and provide a basis for disease surveillance and recognition of work-related risk factors. Methods: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen-specific IgG in serum obtained from N=995 US National Guard soldiers between April-June 2020. Occupational information, e.g. military operating specialty (MOS) codes, and demographic data were obtained via questionnaire. Plaque assays with live SARS-CoV-2 were used to assess serum neutralizing capacity for limited subjects (N=12). Results: The SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity rate among the study population was 10.3% and significantly associated with occupation and demographics. Odds ratios were highest for those working in MOS 2T-Transportation (3.6; 95% CI 0.7-18) and 92F-Fuel specialist/ground and aircraft (6.8; 95% CI 1.5-30), as well as black race (2.2; 95% CI 1.2-4.1), household size >6 (2.5; 95% CI 1.3-4.6) and known COVID-19 exposure (2.0; 95% CI 1.2-3.3). Seropositivity tracked along major interstate highways and clustered near the international airport and the New York City border. SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG+ serum exhibited low to moderate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity with IC50s ranging from 1:15 to 1:280. In limited follow-up testing SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG levels remained elevated up to 7 months. Conclusions: The data highlight increased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among National Guard vs. the local civilian population in association with transportation-related occupations and specific demographics.","Zell, J.; Lucas, C.; Klein, J.; Iwasaki, A.; Slade, M.; Liu, J.; Wisnewski, A.

Hence, it is a lucrative target for anti-viral drug development. In this study, molecular modeling analyses were performed on the structure activity data of recently reported diverse SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors to understand the structural requirements for higher inhibitory activity. The classification-based quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models were generated between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitory activities and different descriptors. Identification of structural fingerprints to increase or decrease in the inhibitory activity was mapped for possible inclusion/exclusion of these fingerprints in the lead optimization process. Challenges in ADME properties of protease inhibitors were also discussed to overcome the problems of oral bioavailability. Further, depending on the modeling results, we have proposed novel as well as potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors.

Historically, angiotensin II (Ang II) was thought to be the primary effector peptide of this system. Ang II is produced predominantly by the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on angiotensin I (Ang I). Ang II acts mainly through the angiotensin II type‐1 receptor (AT(1)) and, together with ACE, these components represent the ‘classical’ axis of the RAS. Drug therapies targeting the RAS by inhibiting Ang II formation (ACE inhibitors) or binding to its receptor (angiotensin receptor blockers) are now in widespread clinical use and have been shown to reduce tissue injury and fibrosis in cardiac and renal disease independently of their effects on blood pressure. In 2000, two groups using different methodologies identified a homolog of ACE, called ACE2, which cleaves Ang II to form the biologically active heptapeptide, Ang‐(1–7). Conceptually, ACE2, Ang‐(1–7), and its putative receptor, the mas receptor represent an ‘alternative’ axis of the RAS capable of opposing the often deleterious actions of Ang II. Interestingly, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers increase Ang‐(1–7) production and it has been proposed that some of the beneficial effects of these drugs are mediated through upregulation of Ang‐(1–7) rather than inhibition of Ang II production or receptor binding. The present review focuses on the novel components and pathways of the RAS with particular reference to their potential contribution towards the pathophysiology of liver disease.","Lubel, John S; Herath, Chandana B; Burrell, Louise M; Angus, Peter W",J Gastroenterol Hepatol,206,5

However, the origin of excessive damages caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unknown. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (2-E) protein alone is able to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like damages in vitro and in vivo. 2-E proteins were found to form a type of pH-sensitive cation channels in bilayer lipid membranes. As observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, heterologous expression of 2-E channels induced rapid cell death in various susceptible cell types and robust secretion of cytokines and chemokines in macrophages. Intravenous administration of purified 2-E protein into mice caused ARDS-like pathological damages in lung and spleen. A dominant negative mutation lowering 2-E channel activity attenuated cell death and SARS-CoV-2 production. Newly identified channel inhibitors exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and excellent cell protective activity in vitro and these activities were positively correlated with inhibition of 2-E channel. Importantly, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of the channel inhibitor effectively reduced both the viral load and secretion of inflammation cytokines in lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2). Our study supports that 2-E is a promising drug target against SARS-CoV-2.","Xia, Bingqing; Shen, Xurui; He, Yang; Pan, Xiaoyan; Liu, Feng-Liang; Wang, Yi; Yang, Feipu; Fang, Sui; Wu, Yan; Duan, Zilei; Zuo, Xiaoli; Xie, Zhuqing; Jiang, Xiangrui; Xu, Ling; Chi, Hao; Li, Shuangqu; Meng, Qian; Zhou, Hu; Zhou, Yubo; Cheng, Xi; Xin, Xiaoming; Jin, Lin; Zhang, Hai-Lin; Yu, Dan-Dan; Li, Ming-Hua; Feng, Xiao-Li; Chen, Jiekai; Jiang, Hualiang; Xiao, Gengfu; Zheng, Yong-Tang; Zhang, Lei-Ke; Shen, Jingshan; Li, Jia; Gao, Zhaobing",Cell Res,206,1
