Based on the specific serotype regions I, II, and III, a multiplex PCR protocol (mPCR) was designed to differentiate the main serotypes causing fish diseases. A real-time PCR method (qPCR) is also described to identify S. parauberis of serotype III in bacterial cultures and fish tissues. In silico and in vitro analyses revealed that both methods have a 100% specificity. The mPCR assay was optimized for the detection of S. parauberis strains of subtypes Ia (amplicon size 213 bp), subtypes Ib and Ic (both amplicon size 303 bp), serotype II (amplicon size 403 bp), and serotype III (amplicon size 130 bp) from bacterial cultures. The qPCR assay was optimized for the identification and quantification of S. parauberis serotype III strains in bacterial cultures and fish tissues. This assay achieved a sensitivity of 2.67 × 10(2) gene copies (equivalent to 3.8 × 10(−9) ng/μl) using pure bacterial cultures of S. parauberis serotype III and 1.76 × 10(2) gene copies in fish tissues experimentally and naturally infected with S. parauberis of the serotype III. The specificity and sensitivity of the protocols described in this study suggest that these methods could be used for diagnostic and/or epidemiological purposes in clinical diagnostic laboratories. KEY POINTS: • Structure of loci cps for S. parauberis of serotypes III, IV and V was described. • mPCR to differentiate S. parauberis serotypes causing disease in fish was optimized. • qPCR assay to quantify strains of S. parauberis serotype III in fish tissues.
