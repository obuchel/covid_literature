Acute upper respiratory infections are common in children who attend childcare and preventing transmission of disease in health setting depends on actions by parents and staff. Therefore the objective of this study is to assess the parental knowledge and practice on antibiotic use for upper respiratory tract infections in children, in Aksum town health institutions, northern Ethiopia, 2018. METHODS: a facility-based cross-sectional study design was adopted involving 384 parents of children visited governmental health facilities in Aksum town from February to March, 2018. Respondents were selected based on the proportion of nurses in the health facilities. SPSS version 22 was applied for data entry and analysis. RESULTS: the total number of questionnaires was 384 resulting in a 100% response rate. Almost half of the parents had poor knowledge of the use of antibiotics in children for URTIs 183(47.7%), followed by 156(40.6%) moderate knowledge and 45(11.7%) good knowledge. Practices regarding antibiotic use in children with URTI varied. Only 12.8% of the parents did not always follow the doctors´ advice regarding antibiotic use. In this study has reported many areas in which parental awareness on antibiotic use for acute URTI is considered inadequate, consequently inappropriate knowledge and practices. CONCLUSION: nearly half of the parents attending the physicians for their children with URTI expected to get antibiotics.","Zeru, Teklay; Berihu, Hagos; Buruh, Gerezgiher; Gebrehiwot, Haftom; Zeru, Mebrahtom",Pan Afr Med J,789,1

The aim of this work is to provide the research community with comprehensive overview of the methods used in these studies as well as a compendium of available open source datasets in regards to COVID-19. In all, 61 journal articles, reports, fact sheets, and websites dealing with COVID-19 were studied and reviewed. It was found that most mathematical modeling done were based on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) and Susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models while most of the AI implementations were Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on X-ray and CT images. In terms of available datasets, they include aggregated case reports, medical images, management strategies, healthcare workforce, demography, and mobility during the outbreak. Both Mathematical modeling and AI have both shown to be reliable tools in the fight against this pandemic. Several datasets concerning the COVID-19 have also been collected and shared open source. However, much work is needed to be done in the diversification of the datasets. Other AI and modeling applications in healthcare should be explored in regards to this COVID-19.","Mohamadou, Youssoufa; Halidou, Aminou; Kapen, Pascalin Tiam",Appl Intell,789,1

With new pathogens continuously emerging, known infectious diseases reemerging, increasing microbial resistance to antimicrobial agents, global environmental change, ease of world travel, and an increasing immunosuppressed population, recognition of infectious diseases plays an ever-important role in surgical pathology. This becomes particularly significant in cases where infectious disease is not suspected clinically and the initial diagnostic workup fails to include samples for culture. As such, it is not uncommon that a lung biopsy becomes the only material available in the diagnostic process of an infectious disease. Once the infectious nature of the pathological process is established, careful search for the causative agent is advised. This can often be achieved by examination of the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections alone as many organisms or their cytopathic effects are visible on routine staining. However, ancillary studies such as histochemical stains, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, or molecular techniques may be needed to identify the organism in tissue sections or for further characterization, such as speciation.","Weissferdt, Annikka",Diagnostic Thoracic Pathology,789,1

First, the rising share of services, particularly innovation-driven digital and knowledge-based services, in foreign trade and multinational enterprise activity; and second, the increasingly important role of global cities as home and hosts to these activities. Our framework distinguishes between national economic policies to promote trade and FDI, referred to as economic diplomacy, and comparable policies originating in cities, referred to as city diplomacy. National economic diplomacy has traditionally promoted trade and investment in goods, often through trade agreements and promotion agencies, and we explore the limitations of these tools as trade in services becomes more important. However, we also note that trade in services, particularly innovation-driven services, is concentrated in global cities, and traded between them, often within MNEs. We conclude that national policies on trade and investment cannot be divorced from innovation and knowledge strategies, and that these strategies cannot be divorced from cities. We emphasize that national economic diplomacy should be better aligned with city diplomacy. We also discuss how the transition to stronger city diplomacy may have consequences for firms and their strategies for corporate diplomacy.","Côté, Christine; Estrin, Saul; Shapiro, Daniel",J Int Bus Policy,789,1
36344,36344,36344,GeoLogic – Graphical Interactive Theorem Prover for Euclidean Geometry,10.223247,0.3546348,2020-06-06,"BACKGROUND: Obese patients undergoing general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation during laparoscopic abdominal surgery commonly have a higher incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), due to factors such as decreasing oxygen reserve, declining functional residual capacity, and reducing lung compliance. Pulmonary atelectasis caused by pneumoperitoneum and mechanical ventilation is further aggravated in obese patients. Recent studies demonstrated that individualized positive end-expiratory pressure (iPEEP) was one of effective lung-protective ventilation strategies. However, there is still no exact method to determine the best iPEEP, especially for obese patients. Here, we will use the best static lung compliance (Cstat) method to determine iPEEP, compared with regular PEEP, by observing the atelectasis area measured by electrical impedance tomography (EIT), and try to prove a better iPEEP setting method for obese patients. METHODS: This study is a single-center, two-arm, prospective, randomized control trial. A total number of 80 obese patients with body mass index ≥ 32.5 kg/m(2) scheduled for laparoscopic gastric volume reduction and at medium to high risk for PPCs will be enrolled. They will be randomly assigned to control group (PEEP5 group) and iPEEP group. A PEEP of 5 cmH(2)O will be used in PEEP5 group, whereas an individualized PEEP value determined by a Cstat-directed PEEP titration procedure will be applied in the iPEEP group. Standard lung-protective ventilation methods such as low tidal volumes (7 ml/kg, predicted body weight, PBW), a fraction of inspired oxygen ≥ 0.5, and recruitment maneuvers (RM) will be applied during and after operation in both groups. Primary endpoints will be postoperative atelectasis measured by chest electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and intraoperative oxygen index. Secondary endpoints will be serum IL-6, TNF-α, procalcitonin (PCT) kinetics during and after surgery, incidence of PPCs, organ dysfunction, length of in-hospital stay, and hospital expense. DISCUSSION: Although there are several studies about the effect of iPEEP titration on perioperative PPCs in obese patients recently, the iPEEP setting method they used was complex and was not always feasible in routine clinical practice. This trial will assess a possible simple method to determine individualized optimal PEEP in obese patients and try to demonstrate that individualized PEEP with lung-protective ventilation methods is necessary for obese patients undergoing general surgery. The results of this trial will support anesthesiologist a feasible Cstat-directed PEEP titration method during anesthesia for obese patients in attempt to prevent PPCs.

Many researchers proposed various anomaly detection techniques to identify events that are inconsistent with past observations. While supervised learning is often used to that end, security experts generally do not have labeled datasets and labeling their data would be excessively expensive. Unsupervised learning, that does not require labeled data should then be used preferably, even if these approaches have led to less relevant results. We introduce in this paper a unified and unique graph representation called security objects’ graphs. This representation mixes and links events of different kinds and allows a rich description of the activities to be analyzed. To detect anomalies in these graphs, we propose an unsupervised learning approach based on auto-encoder. Our hypothesis is that as security objects’ graphs bring a rich vision of the normal situation, an auto-encoder is able to build a relevant model of this situation. To validate this hypothesis, we apply our approach to the CICIDS2017 dataset and show that although our approach is unsupervised, its detection results are as good, and even better than those obtained by many supervised approaches.","Leichtnam, Laetitia; Totel, Eric; Prigent, Nicolas; Mé, Ludovic","Detection of Intrusions and Malware, and Vulnerability Assessment",789,1

But in doing so, the commission also outlined inequalities and structural shortcomings which, ultimately, deny that right to five in every seven people on the planet, setting out the size of the challenge that healthcare faces worldwide in delivering safe, affordable, fit-for-purpose surgery to everyone who needs it. In this chapter, the case is presented for how digital technology can serve a pivotal role in making surgery accessible to the global population. First, the challenges facing healthcare providers in the wake of the Lancet Commission are examined, posing the argument that structural barriers affecting access to surgical care, cost of care rendered, and quality of care are not just restricted to the world’s developing nations, but affect the most highly developed national surgical services as well.

Timely and accurate monitoring enables evidence-based programmatic decisions to be made and action to be taken in advance to avoid impacts on food and nutrition security. This approach must give priority to the most vulnerable populations and ensure the continuity of the critical food supply chain. However, the response also offers a significant opportunity to build a more resilient and sustainable future. Latin American and Caribbean countries are in the early stages of the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, which influences the focus of implemented policies and initiatives. The main implemented policies and initiatives focus on food availability and access, although the way in which these are applied may vary at the subregional level. While in the Caribbean and Mesoamerica these are geared towards self-production, in South America they focus on the delivery of food kits to the most vulnerable people and schoolchildren. The other package of measures aims at the continuity of food production processes, focusing on maintaining a normal transit of food and inputs. While a rapid impact assessment is essential for proper resource management, we understand that this is not a measure reported by all countries, as urgency leads governments to act quickly on needs. In the medium term, it will be necessary to contemplate in the public, private and academic spheres how to adapt to a very different future reality, focusing on the resilience of food systems. In macroeconomic terms, GDP growth for the region in 2020 will slow considerably, mainly due to falling commodity prices, disruptions in value chains and lower demand for tourism services. In addition to the fall in international trade, it is estimated that the value of the region's exports will fall by around 15 percent, mainly due to a reduction in prices (lower world demand). In a scenario of lower GDP growth and, therefore, lower household incomes, the possibility of people in the region to have access to sufficient resources to meet their basic needs, such as health or food, diminishes. If we add to this the fact that in some countries of the region domestic price warnings have been raised, households will have to deal with a scenario of low income and high food prices, a situation of high risk for the food and nutrition security of their inhabitants. Financial support must be sought in order to, firstly, save lives and, secondly, rebuild with a focus on the resilience of food systems to new threats.",,Food systems and COVID,789,20

Past studies have shown inadequate maintenance practices but how far regarding Nigerian public hospital buildings is yet to receive empirical research. This paper aims to investigate the underlying issues leading to inadequate maintenance practices and proffers policy options to improve Nigerian public hospital buildings via an unexplored dimension. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a mixed research design method involving both qualitative and quantitative data. First, results from the qualitative phase were analysed and verified at the quantitative phase through a well-structured questionnaire, developed from the qualitative findings across hospital maintenance experts (work/maintenance department, health-care provider, design team and health-care building/service contractor) in Abuja, Lagos and Benin City. Findings: Insufficient funds for maintenance works, absence of planned maintenance programmes, inadequately trained personnel, etc., emerged as the maintenance inadequacies in the public hospital buildings across the cities covered. The paper categorised the cause of inadequate maintenance practices of public hospital buildings into six groups: statutory requirements, design stage, construction stage, budget for maintenance task, managing maintenance unit activities and user’s perception regarding maintenance management. Research limitations/implications: This paper is limited to maintenance practices of Nigerian public hospital buildings. Future research is needed to evaluate factors that will enhance outsourcing maintenance and the use of the 4th industrial revolution (building information modelling for refurbishment and building automation systems) amongst others in maintenance practices of public hospital buildings. Practical implications: As part of the practical implication, the government and hospital administrators should make provision for adequate funding and accountability of annual maintenance budgetary allocation. Also, the government should establish a national maintenance policy for public infrastructure with an emphasis on preventive maintenance and contractor’s reputation, outstanding pedigree, technical and financial soundness during build maintenance contract award, etc., were recommended. Originality/value: This paper reveals that the stakeholders, especially hospital administrators, policymakers and political office holders that are concern with maintenance budget, approval and disbursement concerning maintenance practices in public hospital buildings need to reawaken to her responsibility because of the inadequate implementation across the cities covered. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ebekozien, A.; Dominic Duru, O.

During COVID-19 Pandemic, traditional oil mining in Wonocolo has been interrupted because world oil prices decreased. This made selling price of crude oil in Wonocolo declined. This made traditional oil mining decreased because oil wells were temporarily closed. The decrease in traditional oil mining might affect river water quality in Wonocolo. In a prior study, the researcher had investigated water quality of Bungsu and Kragsaan River in Wonocolo, based on physicochemical parameters. The river had improved quality during COVID-19 Pandemic, seen from the decrease in the content of several chemical pollutants. Through this study, the researcher examined macrozoobentos community structure as a bio indicator of water quality, like assessing water quality of Bungsu and Kragsaan River based on biological indicators. This study used observation method by determining sample points purposively. Sample of macrozoobentos was analyzed using biodiversity index of Shannon-Wiener, species evennes index, and dominance index. Results of study showed Bungsu River had low biodiversity (H’ index 0.000 – 1.040), distressed community at B-1 and B-3 but stable at B-2, like high dominance at B-1 and B-3 but low at B-2.

However, their accuracy at quantifying limb motion, and clinical acceptability, have not yet been demonstrated. To this end we conducted a two-stage study: First, we compared the inertial accuracy of wrist-worn IMUs, both research-grade (Xsens MTw Awinda, and Axivity AX3) and consumer-grade (Apple Watch Series 3 and 5), relative to gold-standard optical motion tracking (OptiTrack). Given the moderate to the strong performance of the consumer-grade sensors we then evaluated this sensor and surveyed the experiences and attitudes of hospital patients (N=44) and staff (N=15) following a clinical test in which patients wore smartwatches for 1.5-24 hours in the second study. Results indicate that for acceleration, Xsens is more accurate than the Apple smartwatches and Axivity AX3 (RMSE 0.17+/-0.01 g; R2 0.88+/-0.01; RMSE 0.22+/-0.01 g; R2 0.64+/-0.01; RMSE 0.42+/-0.01 g; R2 0.43+/-0.01, respectively). However, for angular velocity, the smartwatches are marginally more accurate than Xsens (RMSE 1.28+/-0.01 rad/s; R2 0.85+/-0.00; RMSE 1.37+/-0.01 rad/s; R2 0.82+/-0.01, respectively). Surveys indicated that in-patients and healthcare professionals strongly agreed that wearable motion sensors are easy to use, comfortable, unobtrusive, suitable for long term use, and do not cause anxiety or limit daily activities. Our results suggest that smartwatches achieved moderate to strong levels of accuracy compared to a gold-standard reference and are likely to be accepted as a pervasive measure of motion/behaviour within hospitals.","Auepanwiriyakul, C.; Waibel, S.; Songa, J.; Bentley, P.; Faisal, A.

Objectives: To determine the association between delay in routine care of chronic inflammatory arthritides (CIAs) and disease activity during the first wave of coronavirus disease 19 pandemic in Verona, Italy. Methods: This study enrolled patients with an established diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and undifferentiated arthritis (UA). Between 01/04/2020 and 30/06/2020, participants were emailed an online questionnaire. Items comprised multiple or single-choice questions evaluating routine rheumatology care disruptions/delays and disease characteristics, treatments, comorbidities, and demographics. Compliance to anti-rheumatic medications was evaluated with I-CQR5. Disease activity was assessed with RAPID3, and active disease was defined as a RAPID3 score≥1. Study period referred to the time between the last rheumatology assessment and the date of enrolment. Results: Of 1210 patients contacted, 450 participated, of whom 219 CIAs patients were included (RA 55.3%, PsA 35.2%, AS 15.1%, UA 3.7%). One hundred twenty-five patients (57.1%) had their routine clinical assessment delayed (median days 68.4;IQR 66.8, 85.9). Patients in this group had significantly higher MDHAQ (p=0.001) and RAPID3 (p=0.031) scores, while they did not differ for disease severity, medications or compliance. Most (87.7%) reported good compliance to therapy;only 5.9% had difficulties in supplying anti-rheumatic medications, and 13.2% discontinued medications for at least four weeks for any reason. However, several patients (37.9%) reported moderate-to-high worse disease activity perception due to routine care delay, and 31.1% self-reported a disease flare (median RAPID3 score 3.8;IQR 2.0, 5.4). One hundred one patients (46.1%) had high disease activity, while only 15.1% were in remission. In logistic regression, active disease was significantly associated with delay of scheduled routine care visit, independent of disease duration, time from last rheumatology assessment, therapy with b/tsDMARDs, and compliance (Table 1, Figure 1 below). Conclusion: In patients with established CIAs, a relatively short delay in routine assessment by a rheumatologist resulted in higher disease activity. Frequent rheumatology referrals appear to be a critical factor for disease activity control in CIAs.","Giollo, A.; Bertoldo, E.; Benini, C.; Viapiana, O.; Idolazzi, L.; Adami, G.; Fassio, A.; Gatti, D.; Rossini, M.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,789,24

The keystrokes create claims, enabling governments to purchase assets and finance deficits in their attempts to stabilize their economies. COVID-19 reminds us that markets are not alert to threats: foreign, domestic, or microbial. Creating the rules and policies to provide people with needed goods and services falls to government, a role that government has only partly fulfilled. The tepid response also reflects a misapprehension of the possibilities of monetary and fiscal policies. There are two dimensions of the market economy, both related, both highlighted by the current pandemic. The first is the institutional basis of the market economy revealed in the promises we make to each other in the form of financial assets. The second is the dependence of people on employment for their livelihood. The inability to earn an income creates insecurity. It also impairs the ability of people to keep their promises. The move to fiat currency in 1971 ended the dollar’s link to gold, expanding the possibilities of both monetary and fiscal policy to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. © 2021, Journal of Economic Issues / Association for Evolutionary Economics.","Watkins, J.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of addition of corticosteroids to the hospital protocol for treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia on rates of death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A before-after study was performed to evaluate the effect of addition of corticosteroids to our institution's COVID-19 treatment protocol on hospital mortality. A total of 257 patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis were included in this study between 3 March 2020 and 14 April 2020. As corticosteroids were widely used after 27 March 2020, two periods were considered for the purposes of this study: the 'before' period from 3-20 March 2020 (n = 85); and the 'after' period from 26 March-14 April 2020 (n = 172). The 'after' period was associated with a lower risk of death [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.97; P = 0.04] and a lower risk of ICU admission or of death before ICU admission (aHR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.64; P = 0.0005) by multivariate analysis adjusted for age, National Early Warning score and institutionalisation status. In conclusion, addition of corticosteroids to our institution's COVID-19 treatment protocol was associated with a significant reduction in hospital mortality in the 'after' period.","Bani-Sadr, Firouzé; Hentzien, Maxime; Pascard, Madeline; N039,; Guyen, Yohan; Servettaz, Amélie; Andreoletti, Laurent; Kanagaratnam, Lukshe; Jolly, Damien",Int J Antimicrob Agents,789,20

The Sentinel-5P is used for mapping the tropospheric NO2 distribution and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for evaluating the atmospheric capability to disperse the pollution. The spatial analysis has been conducted on a regional scale and combined with the number of death cases taken from 66 administrative regions in Italy, Spain, France and Germany. Results show that out of the 4443 fatality cases, 3487 (78%) were in five regions located in north Italy and central Spain. Additionally, the same five regions show the highest NO2 concentrations combined with downwards airflow which prevent an efficient dispersion of air pollution. These results indicate that the long-term exposure to this pollutant may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the COVID-19 virus in these regions and maybe across the whole world.","Ogen, Yaron",Sci Total Environ,789,16

Mothers 2-8 weeks postpartum were recruited from two Florida maternal care sites and surveyed to assess demographics, breastfeeding initiation, and potential telelactation use. Analyses included descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. Of the 88 participants, most were white, married, earned less than USD 50,000 per year, had access to technology, and were willing to use telelactation if it was free (80.7%) or over a secure server (63.6%). Fifty-six percent were willing to use telelactation if it involved feeding the baby without a cover, but only 45.5% were willing if their nipples may be seen. Those with higher odds of willingness to use telelactation under these modesty conditions were experienced using videochat, white, married, and of higher income. Mothers with security concerns had six times the odds of being uncomfortable with telelactation compared to mothers without concerns. While telelactation can improve access to critical services, willingness to use telelactation may depend on conditions of use and sociodemographics.

At the molecular level, the hormonal form of vitamin D signals through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. The VDR and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are expressed throughout the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The advent of genome-wide approaches to gene expression profiling have led to the identification of numerous VDR-regulated genes implicated in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. The molecular data infer that vitamin D signaling should boost innate immunity against pathogens of bacterial or viral origin. Vitamin D signaling also suppresses inflammatory immune responses that underlie autoimmunity and regulate allergic responses. These findings have been bolstered by clinical studies linking vitamin D deficiency to increased rates of infections, autoimmunity, and allergies. Our goals here are to provide an overview of the molecular basis for immune system regulation and to survey the clinical data from pediatric populations, using randomized placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses where possible, linking vitamin D deficiency to increased rates of infections, autoimmune conditions, and allergies, and addressing the impact of supplementation on these conditions.","Mailhot, Geneviève; White, John H",Nutrients,789,19

Methods: Postmortem needle autopsies from the spleen were carried out on 10 patients who died from COVID-19 in Wuhan. Routine hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the pathological changes. The changes of lymphocytes were studied further with immunohistochemistry.RT-PCR was used to detect 2019-nCoV RNA in the spleen. In addition,the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected by in situ hybridization, and coronavirus particles were detected by transmission electron microscopy in 2 cases. Results: There were 7 males and 3 females, with an average age of 68.3 years.Of the 10 cases, 4 had cancer history and another 4 had other underlying diseases respectively.Cough, fever, malaise and dyspnea were the main clinical symptoms.The time from onset to death was 15-45 days.Ten cases patients had normal or slight increase in peripheral blood leukocyte count in the early stage of the disease, 6 cases had significant increase before death. Five patients' peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased in the early stage of the disease, and 10 patients' peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased significantly before the disease progressed or died. Seven cases were treated with corticosteroid (methylprednisolone &#8804;40 mg/d, not more than 5 days). Histopathological examination showed that the cell composition of the spleen decreased, white pulp atrophied at different levels, meanwhile lymphoid follicles decreased or absent;in addition, the ratio of red pulp to white pulp increased with varying degrees. In 7 cases, more neutrophil infiltration was found, and in 5 cases, scattered plasma cell infiltration was found. Macrophage proliferation and hemophagocytic phenomena in a few cells were found in a case. Meanwhile, necrosis and lymphocyte apoptosis were detected in 2 cases, small artery thrombosis and spleen infarction in 1 case, and fungal infection in 1 case. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that the T and B lymphocyte components of the spleen in all cases decreased in varying degrees. CD20(+) B cells were found to accumulate in the lymphoid sheath around the splenic artery in 8 cases. However, CD20 and CD21 immunostaining in 2 cases showed that the number of white pulp was almost normal, and splenic nodules were atrophic. CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+)T cells were decreased. In 9 cases,CD68(+) macrophages were no significant changes in the distribution and quantity. While more CD68(+) cells were found in the medullary sinuses of 1 case (related to fungal infection). Few CD56(+) cells were found. EBV was negative by in situ hybridization. RT-PCR was used to detect the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. One of 10 cases was positive, 39 years old,who was the youngest patient in this group, and the other 9 cases were negative. Coronavirus particles were found in the cytoplasm of macrophage under electron microscope in 2 cases. Conclusions: The death of COVID-19 occurs mainly in the elderly, and some cases have no underlying diseases. Spleen may be one of the organs directly attacked by the virus in some patients who died from COVID-19. T and B lymphocyte in the spleen decrease in varying degrees, lymphoid follicles are atrophied, decreased or absent, and the number of NK cells do not change significantly. And the pathological changes of the spleen are not related to the use of low dose corticosteroid, which may be related to the direct attack of virus and the attack of immune system on its own tissues.","Xu, X; Chang, X N; Pan, H X; Su, H; Huang, B; Yang, M; Luo, D J; Weng, M X; Ma, L; Nie, X",Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,789,13

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the Asian American community's experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the Greater San Francisco Bay Area, California, and to better inform a Federally Qualified Health Center's (FQHC) health care services and response to challenges faced by the community. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between May 20 and June 23, 2020, using a multipronged recruitment approach, including word-of-mouth, FQHC patient appointments, and social media posts. The survey was self-administered online or administered over the phone by FQHC staff in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese. Survey question topics included COVID-19 testing and preventative behaviors, economic impacts of COVID-19, experience with perceived mistreatment due to their race/ethnicity, and mental health challenges. RESULTS: Among 1297 Asian American respondents, only 3.1% (39/1273) had previously been tested for COVID-19, and 46.6% (392/841) stated that they could not find a place to get tested. In addition, about two-thirds of respondents (477/707) reported feeling stressed, and 22.6% (160/707) reported feeling depressed. Furthermore, 5.6% (72/1275) of respondents reported being treated unfairly because of their race/ethnicity. Among respondents who experienced economic impacts from COVID-19, 32.2% (246/763) had lost their regular jobs and 22.5% (172/763) had reduced hours or reduced income. Additionally, 70.1% (890/1269) of respondents shared that they avoid leaving their home to go to public places (eg, grocery stores, church, and school). CONCLUSIONS: We found that Asian Americans had lower levels of COVID-19 testing and limited access to testing, a high prevalence of mental health issues and economic impacts, and a high prevalence of risk-avoidant behaviors (eg, not leaving the house) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings provide preliminary insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Asian American communities served by an FQHC and underscore the longstanding need for culturally and linguistically appropriate approaches to providing mental health, outreach, and education services. These findings led to the establishment of the first Asian multilingual and multicultural COVID-19 testing sites in the local area where the study was conducted, and laid the groundwork for subsequent COVID-19 programs, specifically contact tracing and vaccination programs.","Quach, Thu; Ðoàn, Lan N; Liou, Julia; Ponce, Ninez A",JMIR Public Health Surveill,789,29
