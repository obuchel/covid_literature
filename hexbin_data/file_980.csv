BACKGROUND: The patient had several comorbidities, including liver cirrhosis. He developed ventilation-associated bacterial pneumonia for which he was administered cefepime at an initial dose of 2 g/8 hours. Therapeutic drug monitoring was performed, showing overexposure with an initial trough concentration of >60 mg/L. METHODS: Analysis of pharmacokinetic data and model-based dose adjustment was performed using BestDose software. RESULTS: The patient had unexpected pharmacokinetic parameter values. Serum creatinine was only moderately increased, whereas measured creatinine clearance based on urine collection showed impaired renal function. Bacterial minimum inhibitory concentration was also considered in the dosing decisions. After dose reduction to 0.5 g/8 hours, the cefepime trough concentration progressively declined and reached the target values by the end of the therapy. A post-hoc analysis provided a different interpretation of drug overexposure. CONCLUSION: This case report illustrates how physiological, microbiological, and drug concentration data can be used for model-based dosage individualization of cefepime in intensive care unit patients.","Goutelle, Sylvain; Jay, Lucille; Boidin, Clément; Cohen, Sabine; Bourguignon, Laurent; Bleyzac, Nathalie; Wallet, Florent; Vassal, Olivia; Friggeri, Arnaud",Ther Drug Monit,980,24

Background: The patient had several comorbidities, including liver cirrhosis. He developed ventilation-associated bacterial pneumonia for which he was administered cefepime at an initial dose of 2 g/8 h. Therapeutic drug monitoring was performed, showing overexposure with an initial trough concentration of > 60 mg/L. Methods: Analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) data and model-based dose adjustment was performed using BestDose software. Results: The patient had unexpected PK parameter values. Serum creatinine was only moderately increased, whereas measured creatinine clearance based on urine collection showed impaired renal function. Bacterial minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was also considered in the dosing decisions. After dose reduction to 0.5 g/8 h, the cefepime trough concentration progressively declined and reached the target values by the end of the therapy. A post-hoc analysis provided a different interpretation of drug overexposure.

The Friedmann equations governing the dynamics of the Universe under this entropy modification can be calculated through the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture. We investigate two models, one considering only a matter component and the other including matter and radiation, which have new terms compared to the standard model sourcing the late cosmic acceleration. A Bayesian analysis is performed in which we use five cosmological observations (observational Hubble data, type Ia supernovae, HII galaxies, strong lensing systems, and baryon acoustic oscillations) to constrain the free parameters of both models. From a joint analysis, we obtain constraints that are consistent with the standard cosmological paradigm within $2\sigma$ confidence level. In addition, a complementary dynamical system analysis using local and global variables is developed which allows obtaining a qualitative description of the cosmology. As expected, we found that the dynamical equations have a de Sitter solution at late times.","Leon, Genly; Magana, Juan; Hern'andez-Almada, A.; Garc'ia-Aspeitia, Miguel A.; Verdugo, Tom'as; Motta, V.",,980,17
366605,366605,366605,ACR Convergence 2020 Abstract Supplement,10.835552,-3.0380602,2020,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Individuals with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk for poor disease outcomes and mortality from COVID-19. The pathophysiologic mechanisms for these observations have not been fully elucidated. A critical interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) facilitates viral entry into the host cell. ACE2 is expressed in pancreatic islets, vascular endothelium, and adipose tissue, and the SARS-CoV-2 -ACE2 interaction in these tissues, along with other factors, governs the spectrum and the severity of clinical manifestations among COVID-19 patients with metabolic syndrome. Moreover, the pro-inflammatory milieu observed in patients with metabolic syndrome may contribute toward COVID-19-mediated host immune dysregulation, including suboptimal immune responses, hyperinflammation, microvascular dysfunction, and thrombosis. This review describes the spectrum of clinical features, the likely pathophysiologic mechanisms, and potential implications for the management of metabolic syndrome in COVID-19 patients.","Bansal, Rashika; Gubbi, Sriram; Muniyappa, Ranganath",Endocrinology,980,17
