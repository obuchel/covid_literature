86,86,86,"Bench-to-bedside review: Critical illness-associated cognitive dysfunction – mechanisms, markers, and emerging therapeutics",19.450062,10.637016,2006-11-15,"Cognitive dysfunction is common in critically ill patients, not only during the acute illness but also long after its resolution. A large number of pathophysiologic mechanisms are thought to underlie critical illness-associated cognitive dysfunction, including neuro-transmitter abnormalities and occult diffuse brain injury. Markers that could be used to evaluate the influence of specific mechanisms in individual patients include serum anticholinergic activity, certain brain proteins, and tissue sodium concentration determination via high-resolution three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging. Although recent therapeutic advances in this area are exciting, they are still too immature to influence patient care. Additional research is needed if we are to understand better the relative contributions of specific mechanisms to the development of critical illness-associated cognitive dysfunction and to determine whether these mechanisms might be amenable to treatment or prevention.","Milbrandt, Eric B; Angus, Derek C",Crit Care,62,12
118,118,118,Outcome of paediatric intensive care survivors,19.627214,10.343656,2007-09-07,"The development of paediatric intensive care has contributed to the improved survival of critically ill children. Physical and psychological sequelae and consequences for quality of life (QoL) in survivors might be significant, as has been determined in adult intensive care unit (ICU) survivors. Awareness of sequelae due to the original illness and its treatment may result in changes in treatment and support during and after the acute phase. To determine the current knowledge on physical and psychological sequelae and the quality of life in survivors of paediatric intensive care, we undertook a computerised comprehensive search of online databases for studies reporting sequelae in survivors of paediatric intensive care. Studies reporting sequelae in paediatric survivors of cardiothoracic surgery and trauma were excluded, as were studies reporting only mortality. All other studies reporting aspects of physical and psychological sequelae were analysed. Twenty-seven studies consisting of 3,444 survivors met the selection criteria. Distinct physical and psychological sequelae in patients have been determined and seemed to interfere with quality of life. Psychological sequelae in parents seem to be common. Small numbers, methodological limitations and quantitative and qualitative heterogeneity hamper the interpretation of data. We conclude that paediatric intensive care survivors and their parents have physical and psychological sequelae affecting quality of life. Further well-designed prospective studies evaluating sequelae of the original illness and its treatment are warranted.","Knoester, Hendrika; Grootenhuis, Martha A.; Bos, Albert P.",Eur J Pediatr,62,12
700,700,700,Reducing mortality in sepsis: new directions,19.570452,10.723461,2002-12-05,"Considerable progress has been made in the past few years in the development of therapeutic interventions that can reduce mortality in sepsis. However, encouraging physicians to put the results of new studies into practice is not always simple. A roundtable was thus convened to provide guidance for clinicians on the integration and implementation of new interventions into the intensive care unit (ICU). Five topics were selected that have been shown in randomized, controlled trials to reduce mortality: limiting the tidal volume in acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome, early goal-directed therapy, use of drotrecogin alfa (activated), use of moderate doses of steroids, and tight control of blood sugar. One of the principal investigators for each study was invited to participate in the roundtable. The discussions and questions that followed the presentation of data by each panel member enabled a consensus recommendation to be derived regarding when each intervention should be used. Each new intervention has a place in the management of patients with sepsis. Furthermore, and importantly, the therapies are not mutually exclusive; many patients will need a combination of several approaches – an 'ICU package'. The present article provides guidelines from experts in the field on optimal patient selection and timing for each intervention, and provides advice on how to integrate new therapies into ICU practice, including protocol development, so that mortality rates from this disease process can be reduced.","Vincent, Jean-Louis; Abraham, Edward; Annane, Djillali; Bernard, Gordon; Rivers, Emanuel; Van den Berghe, Greet",Crit Care,62,12
882,882,882,PaCO(2 )and alveolar dead space are more relevant than PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio in monitoring the respiratory response to prone position in ARDS patients: a physiological study,19.556786,10.604686,2011-07-25,"INTRODUCTION: Our aims in this study were to report changes in the ratio of alveolar dead space to tidal volume (VD(alv)/V(T)) in the prone position (PP) and to test whether changes in partial pressure of arterial CO(2 )(PaCO(2)) may be more relevant than changes in the ratio of partial pressure of arterial O(2 )to fraction of inspired O(2 )(PaO(2)/FiO(2)) in defining the respiratory response to PP. We also aimed to validate a recently proposed method of estimation of the physiological dead space (VD(physiol)/V(T)) without measurement of expired CO(2). METHODS: Thirteen patients with a PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio < 100 mmHg were included in the study. Plateau pressure (Pplat), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), blood gas analysis and expiratory CO(2 )were recorded with patients in the supine position and after 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 hours in the PP. Responders to PP were defined after 15 hours of PP either by an increase in PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio > 20 mmHg or by a decrease in PaCO(2 )> 2 mmHg. Estimated and measured VD(physiol)/V(T )ratios were compared. RESULTS: PP induced a decrease in Pplat, PaCO(2 )and VD(alv)/V(T )ratio and increases in PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratios and compliance of the respiratory system (Crs). Maximal changes were observed after six to nine hours. Changes in VD(alv)/V(T )were correlated with changes in Crs, but not with changes in PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratios. When the response was defined by PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio, no significant differences in Pplat, PaCO(2 )or VD(alv)/V(T )alterations between responders (n = 7) and nonresponders (n = 6) were observed. When the response was defined by PaCO(2), four patients were differently classified, and responders (n = 7) had a greater decrease in VD(alv)/V(T )ratio and in Pplat and a greater increase in PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio and in Crs than nonresponders (n = 6). Estimated VD(physiol)/V(T )ratios significantly underestimated measured VD(physiol)/V(T )ratios (concordance correlation coefficient 0.19 (interquartile ranges 0.091 to 0.28)), whereas changes during PP were more reliable (concordance correlation coefficient 0.51 (0.32 to 0.66)). CONCLUSIONS: PP induced a decrease in VD(alv)/V(T )ratio and an improvement in respiratory mechanics. The respiratory response to PP appeared more relevant when PaCO(2 )rather than the PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio was used. Estimated VD(physiol)/V(T )ratios systematically underestimated measured VD(physiol)/V(T )ratios.","Charron, Cyril; Repesse, Xavier; Bouferrache, Koceïla; Bodson, Laurent; Castro, Samuel; Page, Bernard; Jardin, François; Vieillard-Baron, Antoine",Crit Care,62,12

METHODS: We performed a prospective study of patients admitted to three adult ICUs of our hospital from December 2010 to February 2011. All tracheal aspirate (TA) samples sent to the microbiology department were systematically screened for influenza. We defined influenza as unsuspected if testing was not requested and the patient was not receiving empirical antiviral therapy after sample collection. RESULTS: We received TA samples from 105 patients. Influenza was detected in 31 patients and was classified as unsuspected in 15 (48.4%) patients, and as hospital acquired in 13 (42%) patients. Suspected and unsuspected cases were compared, and significant differences were found for age (53 versus 69 median years), severe respiratory failure (68.8% versus 20%), surgery (6.3% versus 60%), median days of ICU stay before diagnosis (1 versus 4), nosocomial infection (18.8% versus 66.7%), cough (93.8% versus 53.3%), localized infiltrate on chest radiograph (6.3% versus 40%), median days to antiviral treatment (2 versus 9), pneumonia (93.8% versus 53.3%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (75% versus 26.7%). Multivariate analysis showed admission to the surgical ICU (odds ratio (OR), 37.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.1 to 666.6; P = 0.01) and localized infiltrate on chest radiograph (OR, 27.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 584.1; P = 0.03) to be independent risk factors for unsuspected influenza. Overall mortality at 30 days was 29%. ICU admission for severe respiratory failure was an independent risk factor for poor outcome. CONCLUSION: During the influenza season, almost one third of critical patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection had influenza, and in 48.4%, the influenza was unsuspected. Lower respiratory samples from adult ICUs should be systematically screened for influenza during seasonal epidemics.","Giannella, Maddalena; Rodríguez-Sánchez, Belen; Roa, Paula López; Catalán, Pilar; Muñoz, Patricia; de Viedma, Darío García; Bouza, Emilio",Crit Care,62,12
1070,1070,1070,Interest of a simple on-line screening registry for measuring ICU burden related to an influenza pandemic,19.556667,10.84002,2012-07-09,"INTRODUCTION: The specific burden imposed on Intensive Care Units (ICUs) during the A/H1N1 influenza 2009 pandemic has been poorly explored. An on-line screening registry allowed a daily report of ICU beds occupancy rate by flu infected patients (Flu-OR) admitted in French ICUs. METHODS: We conducted a prospective inception cohort study with results of an on-line screening registry designed for daily assessment of ICU burden. RESULTS: Among the 108 centers participating to the French H1N1 research network on mechanical ventilation (REVA) - French Society of Intensive Care (SRLF) registry, 69 ICUs belonging to seven large geographical areas voluntarily participated in a website screening-registry. The aim was to daily assess the ICU beds occupancy rate by influenza-infected and non-infected patients for at least three weeks. Three hundred ninety-one critically ill infected patients were enrolled in the cohort, representing a subset of 35% of the whole French 2009 pandemic cohort; 73% were mechanically ventilated, 13% required extra corporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22% died. The global Flu-OR in these ICUs was only 7.6%, but it exceeded a predefined 15% critical threshold in 32 ICUs for a total of 103 weeks. Flu-ORs were significantly higher in University than in non-University hospitals. The peak ICU burden was poorly predicted by observations obtained at the level of large geographical areas. CONCLUSIONS: The peak Flu-OR during the pandemic significantly exceeded a 15% critical threshold in almost half of the ICUs, with an uneven distribution with time, geographical areas and between University and non-University hospitals. An on-line assessment of Flu-OR via a simple dedicated registry may contribute to better match resources and needs.","Richard, Jean-Christophe Marie; Pham, Tài; Brun-Buisson, Christian; Reignier, Jean; Mercat, Alain; Beduneau, Gaëtan; Régnier, Bernard; Mourvillier, Bruno; Guitton, Christophe; Castanier, Matthias; Combes, Alain; Tulzo, Yves Le; Brochard, Laurent",Crit Care,62,12
1071,1071,1071,Epidemiology and outcome of severe pneumococcal pneumonia admitted to intensive care unit: a multicenter study,19.537457,10.540478,2012-08-15,"INTRODUCTION: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) account for a high proportion of ICU admissions, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the main pathogen responsible for these infections. However, little is known on the clinical features and outcomes of ICU patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. The aims of this study were to provide epidemiological data and to determine risk factors of mortality in patients admitted to ICU for severe S. pneumoniae CAP. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of two prospectively-acquired multicentre ICU databases (2001-2008). Patients admitted for management of severe pneumococcal CAP were enrolled if they met the 2001 American Thoracic Society criteria for severe pneumonia, had life-threatening organ failure and had a positive microbiological sample for S. pneumoniae. Patients with bronchitis, aspiration pneumonia or with non-pulmonary pneumococcal infections were excluded. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty two patients were included, with a median SAPS II score reaching 47 [36-64]. Acute respiratory failure (n = 154) and septic shock (n = 54) were their most frequent causes of ICU admission. Septic shock occurred in 170 patients (77%) and mechanical ventilation was required in 186 patients (84%); renal replacement therapy was initiated in 70 patients (32%). Bacteraemia was diagnosed in 101 patients. The prevalence of S. pneumoniae strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin was 39.7%. Although antibiotherapy was adequate in 92.3% of cases, hospital mortality reached 28.8%. In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for mortality were age (OR 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02-1.08)), male sex (OR 2.83 (95% CI: 1.16-6.91)) and renal replacement therapy (OR 3.78 (95% CI: 1.71-8.36)). Co-morbidities, macrolide administration, concomitant bacteremia or penicillin susceptibility did not influence outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In ICU, mortality of pneumococcal CAP remains high despite adequate antimicrobial treatment. Baseline demographic data and renal replacement therapy have a major impact on adverse outcome.","Mongardon, Nicolas; Max, Adeline; Bouglé, Adrien; Pène, Frédéric; Lemiale, Virginie; Charpentier, Julien; Cariou, Alain; Chiche, Jean-Daniel; Bedos, Jean-Pierre; Mira, Jean-Paul",Crit Care,62,12
1204,1204,1204,Systemic varicella-zoster virus infection in two critically ill patients in an intensive care unit,19.510313,10.84335,2013-07-08,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) usually causes localized zoster in adults. However, in immunocompromised patients, it can cause systemic infection accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and hepatitis. Although most of critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) are immunologically compromised, they are usually not considered to be at risk for systemic VZV infection. We report two cases of systemic VZV infection occurring in critically ill patients in an ICU. One patient was a 69-year-old man with Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced purpurafulminans, and the other was a 75-year-old woman with severe acute pancreatitis. During the clinical course in the ICU, characteristic vesicles with umbilical fossa appeared diffusely and bilaterally on their face, trunk, and extremities. VZV-specific IgG levels were confirmed to be elevated compared to that of the pre-onset, and a diagnosis of recurrent VZV infection was made in both patients. The patients were treated at the same ICU but did not coincide with each other; therefore a cross-infection was unlikely. They were treated with intravenous acyclovir, but the latter patient eventually died of respiratory failure. VZV infection can cause a number of serious complications, and can lead to death in some patients. Early detection and proper treatment are needed to prevent the infection from spreading out and save the patients. It might be necessary to consider antiviral prophylaxis against VZV infection for a part of critically ill patients in ICU, although the effectiveness of this approach is yet to be established.","Hagiya, Hideharu; Kimura, Maya; Miyamoto, Toru; Otsuka, Fumio",Virol J,62,12

Patient-centered and preventative strategies assume paramount importance in this era of limited health-care resources, in which effective targeted therapy is required to achieve the best outcomes. Risk stratification using severity scores and inflammatory biomarkers is a promising strategy for identifying sick patients early during their hospital stay. The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens is becoming a major hurdle in intensive care units. Cooperation, education, and interaction between multiple disciplines in the intensive care unit are required to limit the spread of resistant pathogens and to improve care. In this review, we summarize findings from major publications over the last year in the field of respiratory infections in critically ill patients, putting an emphasis on a newer understanding of pathogenesis, use of biomarkers, and antibiotic stewardship and examining new treatment options and preventive strategies.","Nair, Girish B; Niederman, Michael S",Crit Care,62,12
2188,2188,2188,Association of REL polymorphisms and outcome of patients with septic shock,19.580778,10.831613,2016-04-08,"BACKGROUND: cRel, a subunit of NF-κB, is implicated in the inflammatory response observed in autoimmune disease. Hence, knocked-out mice for cRel had a significantly higher mortality, providing new and important functions of cRel in the physiopathology of septic shock. Whether genetic variants in the human REL gene are associated with severity of septic shock is unknown. METHODS: We genotyped a population of 1040 ICU patients with septic shock and 855 ICU controls for two known polymorphisms of REL; REL rs842647 and REL rs13031237. Outcome of patients according to the presence of REL variant alleles was compared. RESULTS: The distribution of REL variant alleles was not significantly different between patients and controls. Among the septic shock group, REL rs13031237*T minor allele was not associated with worse outcome. In contrast, REL rs842647*G minor allele was significantly associated with more multi-organ failure and early death [OR 1.4; 95 % CI (1.02–1.8)]. CONCLUSION: In a large ICU population, we report a significant clinical association between a variation in the human REL gene and severity and mortality of septic shock, suggesting for the first time a new insight into the role of cRel in response to infection in humans.","Toubiana, Julie; Courtine, Emilie; Tores, Frederic; Asfar, Pierre; Daubin, Cédric; Rousseau, Christophe; Ouaaz, Fatah; Marin, Nathalie; Cariou, Alain; Chiche, Jean-Daniel; Mira, Jean-Paul",Ann Intensive Care,62,12
2353,2353,2353,Prevalence and risk factors of pneumothorax among patients admitted to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit,19.766647,10.505069,2016-08-11,"OBJECTIVE: Pneumothorax should be considered a medical emergency and requires a high index of suspicion and prompt recognition and intervention. AIMS: The objective of the study was to evaluate cases developing pneumothorax following admission to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) over a 5-year period. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Case notes of all PICU patients (n = 1298) were reviewed, revealing that 135 cases (10.4%) developed pneumothorax, and these were compared with those patients who did not. The most common tool for diagnosis used was chest X-ray followed by a clinical examination. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Case notes of 1298 patients admitted in PICU over 1-year study. RESULTS: Patients with pneumothorax had higher mortality rate (P < 0.001), longer length of stay (P < 0.001), higher need for mechanical ventilation (MV) (P < 0.001), and were of younger age (P < 0.001), lower body weight (P < 0.001), higher pediatric index of mortality 2 score on admission (P < 0.001), higher pediatric logistic organ dysfunction score (P < 0.001), compared to their counterpart. Iatrogenic pneumothorax (IP) represented 95% of episodes of pneumothorax. The most common causes of IP were barotrauma secondary to MV, central vein catheter insertion, and other (69.6%, 13.2%, and 17.2%, respectively). Compared to ventilated patients without pneumothorax, ventilated patients who developed pneumothorax had a longer duration of MV care (P < 0.001) and higher nonconventional and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation settings (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that pneumothorax is common in Alexandria University PICU patients, especially in those on MV and emphasized the importance of the strict application of protective lung strategies among ventilated patients to minimize the risk of pneumothorax.","El-Nawawy, Ahmed Ahmed; Al-Halawany, Amina Sedky; Antonios, Manal Abdelmalik; Newegy, Reem Gamal",Indian J Crit Care Med,62,12
2694,2694,2694,Respiratory Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction: An Important Diagnostic Tool in Immunocompromised Patients,19.490873,10.874495,2017-04-11,"BACKGROUND: Viruses and atypical pathogens can cause significant respiratory illness in immunocompromised patients. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) has improved the diagnostic yield of pathogens, and it is easier to identify the co-infections also. The present study was done to evaluate the performance of MPCR on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples in immunocompromised patients. METHODS: Atotal of 177 BAL specimens collected over a 19 months period from immunocompromised patients with respiratory illness were analyzed with the MPCR and aerobic culture. Patients were divided into four according to the pathogens. Category V (only viral), Category NV (nonviral, i.e., bacteria and atypical), Category M (mixed, i.e., both viral and nonviral pathogen), and Category UK (unknown etiology). RESULTS: MPCR identified the causative pathogen in 59.3% of patients while culture could identify only in 37.8% of patients. Most frequent etiological agent was Klebsiella pneumoniae (32%), followed by cytomegalovirus (21%), and Pneumocystis jirovecii (10%). Numbers of patients in each category were Category V (9.6%), Category NV (43.5%), Category M (19.8%), and Category UK (27.1%). Mortality was significantly higher in patients of Category M having mixed infections.

2898,2898,2898,Assessment of immune organ dysfunction in critical illness: utility of innate immune response markers,19.77614,10.77388,2017-10-23,"In critically ill patients, organ dysfunctions are routinely assessed, monitored, and treated. Mounting data show that substantial critical illness-induced changes in the immune system can be observed in most ICU patients and that not only “hyper-inflammation” but also persistence of an anti-inflammatory phenotype (as in sepsis-associated immunosuppression) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Despite common perception, changes in functional immunity cannot be adequately assessed by routine inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, or numerical analysis of leukocyte (sub)-counts. Cytokines appear also not suited due to their short half-life and pleiotropy, their unexclusive origin from immune cells, and their potential to undergo antagonization by circulating inactivating molecules. Thus, beyond leukocyte quantification and use of routine biomarkers, direct assessment of immune cell function seems required to characterize the immune systems’ status. This may include determination of, e.g., ex vivo cellular cytokine release, phagocytosis activity, and/or antigen-presenting capacity. In this regard, standardized flow-cytometric assessment of the major histocompatibility-II complex human leukocyte antigen (-D related) (HLA-DR) has gained particular interest. Monocytic HLA-DR (mHLA-DR) controls the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity and may serve as a “global” biomarker of injury-associated immunosuppression, and its decreased expression is associated with adverse clinical outcomes (e.g., secondary infection risk, mortality). Importantly, recent data demonstrate that injury-associated immunosuppression can be reversed—opening up new therapeutic avenues in affected patients. Here we discuss the potential scientific and clinical value of assessment of functional immunity with a focus on monocytes/macrophages and review the current state of knowledge and potential perspectives for affected critically ill patients.","Pfortmueller, Carmen Andrea; Meisel, Christian; Fux, Michaela; Schefold, Joerg C.",Intensive Care Med Exp,62,12

RVI have been associated with increased length of hospital stay, severe disease course, unnecessary antimicrobial exposure and nosocomial outbreaks in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Virus transmission has been described to occur via health care professionals, parents and other visitors. Most at risk are infants born prematurely, due to their immature immune system and the fact that they stay in the NICU for a considerable length of time. A prevalence of RVIs in the NICU in symptomatic infants of 6–30% has been described, although RVIs are most probably underdiagnosed, since testing for viral pathogens is not performed routinely in symptomatic patients in many NICUs. Additional challenges are the wide range of clinical presentation of RVIs, their similarity to bacterial infections and the unreliable detection methods prior to the era of molecular biology based technologies. In this review, current knowledge of early-life RVI in the NICU is discussed. Reviewed viral pathogens include human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus, and discussed literature is restricted to reports based on modern molecular biology techniques. The review highlights therapeutic approaches and possible preventive strategies. Furthermore, short- and long-term consequences of RVIs in infants hospitalized in the NICU are discussed.","Pichler, Karin; Assadian, Ojan; Berger, Angelika",Front Microbiol,62,12

Clinical interest in this method has been driven by the need for bedside monitoring of the dynamics of the lungs and the effects of ventilatory manoeuvres, including changes in ventilator settings, suctioning, chest drains, positioning and physiotherapy. We aimed to describe the use of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) as a clinical tool in a tertiary Paediatric Intensive Care unit. Children requiring intensive care with a variety of clinical conditions had an electrode belt with 16 electrodes wrapped around the chest, which sequentially applied a small alternating current from each electrode pair. The signal gives information on both real time, regional, global, and relative data. With the correct application, and understanding of the monitor, much clinical information can be gained, with potentially significant patient benefit. We present the clinical use of EIT in six conditions: Asthma, Ventilation weaning and expansion recoil, Sequential Lobar Collapse, Targeted Physiotherapy, Pleural Effusion assessment, and PEEP optimisation. Screenshots and analyses are offered displaying the pragmatic use of this technology. Electrical Impedance Tomography is a clinically useful tool on the Paediatric Intensive Care unit. It allows monitoring of a patient’s respiratory function in ways which are not possible through any other means.

The optimal modalities of antimicrobial therapy remain to be determined. Our objective was to describe the epidemiology and prognostic factors associated with S. maltophilia pneumonia, focusing on antimicrobial therapy. METHODS: This nationwide retrospective study included all patients admitted to 25 French mixed intensive care units between 2012 and 2017 with hospital-acquired S. maltophilia HAP during intensive care unit stay. Primary endpoint was time to in-hospital death. Secondary endpoints included microbiologic effectiveness and antimicrobial therapeutic modalities such as delay to appropriate antimicrobial treatment, mono versus combination therapy, and duration of antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: Of the 282 patients included, 84% were intubated at S. maltophilia HAP diagnosis for duration of 11 [5–18] days. The Simplified Acute Physiology Score II was 47 [36–63], and the in-hospital mortality was 49.7%. Underlying chronic pulmonary comorbidities were present in 14.1% of cases. Empirical antimicrobial therapy was considered effective on S. maltophilia according to susceptibility patterns in only 30% of cases. Delay to appropriate antimicrobial treatment had, however, no significant impact on the primary endpoint. Survival analysis did not show any benefit from combination antimicrobial therapy (HR = 1.27, 95%CI [0.88; 1.83], p = 0.20) or prolonged antimicrobial therapy for more than 7 days (HR = 1.06, 95%CI [0.6; 1.86], p = 0.84). No differences were noted in in-hospital death irrespective of an appropriate and timely empiric antimicrobial therapy between mono- versus polymicrobial S. maltophilia HAP (p = 0.273). The duration of ventilation prior to S. maltophilia HAP diagnosis and ICU length of stay were shorter in patients with monomicrobial S. maltophilia HAP (p = 0.031 and p = 0.034 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: S. maltophilia HAP occurred in severe, long-stay intensive care patients who mainly required prolonged invasive ventilation.

In a recent randomized controlled trial (Dexmedetomidine for Sepsis in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Randomized Evolution [DESIRE]), we demonstrated that dexmedetomidine was associated with reduced mortality risk among patients with severe sepsis. We performed this exploratory sub-analysis to examine the mechanism underlying improved survival in patients sedated with dexmedetomidine. METHODS: The DESIRE trial compared a sedation strategy with and without dexmedetomidine among 201 mechanically ventilated adult patients with sepsis across eight ICUs in Japan. In the present study, we included 104 patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores of ≥ 23 (54 in the dexmedetomidine [DEX] group and 50 in the non-dexmedetomidine [non-DEX] group). Initially, we compared the changes in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores from the baseline within 6 days after randomization between groups. Subsequently, we evaluated the variables comprising the organ component of the SOFA score that showed relevant improvement in the initial comparison. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 71.0 ± 14.1 years. There was no difference in the median APACHE II score between the two groups (29 [interquartile range (IQR), 25–31] vs. 30 [IQR, 25–33]; p = 0.35). The median SOFA score at the baseline was lower in the DEX group (9 [IQR, 7–11] vs. 11 [IQR, 9–13]; p = 0.01). While the renal SOFA subscore at the baseline was similar for both groups, it significantly decreased in the DEX group on day 4 (p = 0.02). During the first 6 days, the urinary output was not significantly different (p = 0.09), but serum creatinine levels were significantly lower (p = 0.04) in the DEX group. The 28-day and in-hospital mortality rates were significantly lower in the DEX group (22% vs. 42%; p = 0.03, 28% vs. 52%; p = 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: A sedation strategy with dexmedetomidine is associated with improved renal function and decrease mortality rates among patients with severe sepsis.

We reported a uremic patient with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE-fm) pneumonia, possibly related to epileptic seizures. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year old man with uremia on hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital with complaint of recurrent epileptic seizures, followed by a two-week history of recurrent fever and cough with purulent sputum. Chest CT demonstrated multiple exudation of both lungs. He was diagnosed as community acquired pneumonia. Despite antibiotic combination therapy, abnormal chest shadows aggravated. Sputum and blood cultures were initially negative, but later blood culture grew VRE-fm. We suspected aspiration of gastrointestinal content induced by epilepsy as the most likely mechanism. The patient was successfully treated with a four-week course of linezolid according to the antibiotic susceptibility testing. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should consider multi-drug resistant organisms such as VRE in uremic patients with pneumonia that fails to resolve with broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially in the cases with aspiration induced by epilepsy, immunocompromised conditions, and repeated or prolonged hospitalizations.","Li, Fengqin; Wang, Yonglan; Sun, Linlin; Wang, Xiaoxia",BMC Infect Dis,62,12

The aim of this confirmatory, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 study was to assess the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of IC43 recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa vaccine in non-surgical ICU patients. METHODS: Eight hundred patients aged 18 to 80 years admitted to the ICU with expected need for mechanical ventilation for ≥ 48 h were randomized 1:1 to either IC43 100 μg or saline placebo, given in two vaccinations 7 days apart. The primary efficacy endpoint was all-cause mortality in patients 28 days after the first vaccination. Immunogenicity and safety were also evaluated. FINDINGS: All-cause mortality rates at day 28 were 29.2% vs 27.7% in the IC43 and placebo groups, respectively (P = .67). Overall survival (Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, P = .46) and proportion of patients with ≥ one confirmed P. aeruginosa invasive infection or respiratory tract infection also did not differ significantly between both groups. The geometric mean fold increase in OprF/I titers was 1.5 after the first vaccination, 20 at day 28, after the second vaccination, and 2.9 at day 180. Significantly more patients in the placebo group (96.5%) had ≥ one adverse event (AE) versus the IC43 100 μg group (93.1%) (P = .04). The most frequently reported severe AEs in the IC43 and placebo groups were respiratory failure (6.9% vs 5.7%, respectively), septic shock (4.1% vs 6.5%), cardiac arrest (4.3% vs 5.7%), multiorgan failure (4.6% vs 5.5%), and sepsis (4.6% vs 4.2%). No related serious AEs were reported in the IC43 group. INTERPRETATION: The IC43 100 μg vaccine was well tolerated in this large population of medically ill, mechanically ventilated patients. The vaccine achieved high immunogenicity but provided no clinical benefit over placebo in terms of overall mortality. TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01563263).

The purpose of this study was to explore major microbial trends in burn patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at burn wards and intensive care units, where burn patients were admitted following an event of dust explosion. Data were collected for a number of variables including severity of burns, demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and therapeutic devices. RESULTS: A total of 1132 specimens were collected from 37 hospitalized burn patients with mean TBSA of 46.1%.The most commonly isolated species were Staphylococcus spp. (22.4%). The highest rate of antibiotic resistance was observed in carbapenem–resistant A. baumannii (14.6%), followed by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (11.3%). For each additional 10% TBSA, the isolation of MDRO increased 2.58–17.57 times (p < 0.05); for each additional 10% of the third-degree burn severity, the risk of MDRO significantly decreased by 47% (95% CI, 0.38–0.73, p < 0.001) by Cox model. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of overall microbial isolates increased with the increase in TBSA and duration of time after burns. The extent of TBSA was the most important factor affecting MDRO.","Chen, Yin-Yin; Wu, Ping-Feng; Chen, Chii-Shya; Chen, Ian-Horng; Huang, Wan-Tsuei; Wang, Fu-Der",BMC Infect Dis,62,12

Moreover, microfluidic devices are also part of the technological framework that has enabled a new type of scientific information to be revealed, i.e. that based on intensive screening of complete sets of gene and protein sequences. A deeper bioanalytical perspective may provide quantitative and qualitative tools, enabling study of various diseases and, eventually, may offer support for the development of accurate and reliable methods for clinical assessment. This would open the way to molecule-based diagnostics, i.e. establish accurate diagnosis and disease prognosis based on identification and/or quantification of biomacromolecules, for example proteins or nucleic acids.

However, identification of infectious agents in severe pneumonia remains a major challenge so far. In this study, the potential utility of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in detecting nonbacterial pathogens in patients with severe pneumonia was retrospectively evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 106 patients diagnosed with severe pneumonia at our hospital from September 2015 to December 2017 were included, and their baseline clinical characteristics were collected. Nonbacterial infectious agents detected by TEM in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serological tests were summarized. The detection rates were further compared between TEM and serological tests. RESULTS: BALF examination under the transmission electron microscope revealed 24 viruses, 16 mycoplasmas, 18 chlamydia, 2 fungi and 74 bacteria in 99 samples, among which 61 samples were mixed infections. The combined use of serological tests and TEM significantly improved the detection rate of nonbacterial infectious agents in patients with severe pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support that implementation of TEM could improve the sensitivity for detecting viruses, atypical pathogens and mixed infections in BALF from patient of severe pneumonia. Therefore, TEM may be used as an auxiliary diagnostic method of other microbiological tests in severe pneumonia.","Jiang, Juan; Hu, Chengping; Li, Yuanyuan; Pan, Pinhua; Su, Xiaoli; Deng, Pengbo; Wang, Junpu; Wu, Xiaoying",Am J Med Sci,62,12

Trauma patients are at particularly high risk of SIRS, and most these patients do not have infection documented. The prevalence of infection and bacteraemia increases with the number of SIRS criteria met, and with increasing severity of the septic syndromes. About one-third of patients with SIRS have or evolve to sepsis. Sepsis may occur in approximately 25 % of ICU patients, and bacteraemic sepsis in 10 %. In such patients, sepsis evolves to severe sepsis in > 50 % of cases, whereas evolution to severe sepsis in non-ICU patients is about 25 %. Severe sepsis and septic shock occur in 2 %–3 % of ward patients and 10 %–15 % or more ICU patients, depending on the case-mix; 25 % of patients with severe sepsis have shock. There is a graded severity from SIRS to sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, with an associated 28-d mortality of approximately 10 %, 20 %, 20 %–40 %, and 40 %–60 %, respectively. Mortality rates are similar within each stage, whether infection is documented or not, and microbiological characteristics of infection do not substantially influence outcome, although the source of infection does. While about three of four deaths occur during the first months after sepsis, the septic syndromes significantly impact on long-term outcome, with an estimated 50 % reduction of life expectancy over the following five years. The major determinants of outcome, both short-term and long-term, of patients with sepsis are the severity of underlying diseases and comorbidities, the presence of shock and organ failures at onset of sepsis or evolving thereafter. It has been estimated that two-thirds of the overall mortality can be attributed to sepsis.¶Conclusions: The prevalence of sepsis in ICU patients is very high, and most patients have clinically or microbiologically documented infection, except in specific subset of patients. The prognosis of septic syndromes is related to underlying diseases and the severity of the inflammatory response and its sequelae, reflected in shock and organ dysfunction/failures.","Brun-Buisson, C.",Intensive Care Med,62,12

We hypothesized that as fas as an adequate oxygen delivery is provided, oxygen consumption, when determined by indirect calorimetry, is not dependent on oxygen delivery in critically ill patients whereas calculated oxygen consumption is associated with artefactual correlation of oxygen consumption and delivery. DESIGN: Oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption and their relationship were analyzed prospectively. Metabolic data gained from both measured and calculated methods were obtained simultaneously before and after volume loading. SETTING: The study was completed in the intensive care unit as part of the management protocol of the patients. PATIENTS: 32 consecutive patients entered the study and were divided into 3 groups according to a clinical condition known to favour oxygen supply dependency: sepsis syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome and acute primary liver failure. INTERVENTION: The rise in oxygen delivery was obtained by colloid infusion (oxygen flux test) performed in hemodynamically and metabolically stable patients. All were mechanically ventilated. No change in therapy was allowed during the test. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Oxygen consumption was simultaneously evaluated by calculation (Fick Principle) and direct measurement using indirect calorimetry. Oxygen delivery was derived from the cardiac output (thermodilution) and arterial content of oxygen. Oxygen supply dependency was considered while observing an increase in oxygen delivery greater than 45 ml/min·m(2). Irrespective of patient's clinical diagnosis and outcome, measured oxygen uptake remained unaltered by volume infusion whereas both oxygen delivery and calculated oxygen consumption increased significantly. Arterial lactate level>2 mmol/l and measured oxygen extraction ratio>25% failed to identify oxygen supply dependency when measured data were considered. CONCLUSION: Analysis of oxygen uptake, when measured by indirect calorimetry, failed to substantiate oxygen supply dependency in the vast majority of the critically ill patients irrespective of diagnosis and outcome. Mathematical coupling of shared variables accounted for the correlation between oxygen delivery and calculated oxygen consumption.","Hanique, G.; Dugernier, T.; Laterre, P.

The patient's course was atypical in that he was anicteric and had no evidence of meningitis when he presented with fever, rapidly progressive and severe rhabdomyolysis, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, and respiratory distress syndrome. Although he recovered after a protracted illness, he required major life support, including mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. Initial antimicrobial therapy was designed to cover major bacterial and atypical pathogens, including leptospires. An in-depth work-up for causes of this catastrophic illness confirmed acute leptospirosis. Although rare, leptospirosis is a potentially lethal infection classically associated with hepatitis, azotemia, and meningitis. Most patients experience self-limited illness, with fever, myalgias, and malaise followed by an immune-mediated aseptic meningitis. A small proportion develop shock and multiple organ dysfunction. Whereas myalgias are ubiquitous in leptospiral infection, and most patients show mildly elevated muscle enzymes, life-threatening rhabdomyolysis is rare. This atypical case is reported to urge clinicians to consider leptospirosis in the evaluation of a patient with cryptogenic sepsis who develops multiple organ dysfunction associated with rhabdomyolysis.

These genes originated from host cells and are probably derived from genes normally involved in the control of cell proliferation(2). The cellular counterparts of three oncogenes have been identified as a growth factor or growth factor receptor(3–6); related oncogenes include receptor-like membrane proteins which often express tyrosine kinase activity. These growth factor-related oncogenes are structurally and biochemically distinct from the membrane-associated ras gene family, which bind and hydrolyse GTP(7–9). Oncogenes localized primarily in the cytoplasm which probably have serine kinase activity, have also been identified(10–12). Although the structure and biochemistry of many oncogenes have been extensively studied, relatively little is known about the functional relationships of oncogene proteins within the cell. An opportunity to study such interaction is provided by the identification of a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes cellular ras proteins when microinjected into cells(13). It has been shown previously that the injected antibody inhibits the initiation of S-phase in NIH 3T3 cells(14). In the present study we injected this monoclonal antibody into NIH 3T3 cells transformed by a variety of oncogenes. The results show that transformation by three growth factor receptor-like oncogenes depends on c-ras proteins, while transformation by two cytoplasmic oncogenes appears to be independent of c-ras protein.","Smith, Mark R.; DeGudicibus, Steven J.; Stacey, Dennis W.",Nature,62,12

Their ability to track seasonal influenza and predict heightened winter healthcare burden in the light of high activity in Australia in 2017 was untested. METHODS: Four transmission models were used in forecasting the 2017/2018 seasonal influenza epidemic in England: a stratified primary care model using daily, region-specific, counts and virological swab positivity of influenza-like illness consultations in general practice (GP); a strain-specific (SS) model using weekly, national GP ILI and virological data; an intensive care model (ICU) using reports of ICU influenza admissions; and a synthesis model that included all data sources. For the first 12 weeks of 2018, each model was applied to the latest data to provide estimates of epidemic parameters and short-term influenza forecasts. The added value of pre-season population susceptibility data was explored. RESULTS: The combined results provided valuable nowcasts of the state of the epidemic. Short-term predictions of burden on primary and secondary health services were initially highly variable before reaching consensus beyond the observed peaks in activity between weeks 3–4 of 2018. Estimates for R(0) were consistent over time for three of the four models until week 12 of 2018, and there was consistency in the estimation of R(0) across the SPC and SS models, and in the ICU attack rates estimated by the ICU and the synthesis model. Estimation and predictions varied according to the assumed levels of pre-season immunity. CONCLUSIONS: This exercise successfully applied a range of pandemic models to seasonal influenza. Forecasting early in the season remains challenging but represents a crucially important activity to inform planning.

The affected individual regresses and is unable to self-care and quite characteristically will resist rehabilitation, worsen with praise or remain entirely passive. This systematic review was aimed at describing clinical features of PRS, current interventions and to summarise some of the nosological aspects of the condition. Without language restriction, an electronic search was conducted in Embase, PsychInfo, Medline, Cochrane library, and PubMed databases yielding 29 articles with a total of 79 cases. We performed a risk of assessment bias using an adapted Newcastle–Ottawa Scale and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 124 articles were identified, of which 29 were included and these yielded 79 cases. Seventy-six percent of the studies had a low rate of risk of assessment bias (good quality). Our results show that PRS overlaps with several conditions, mainly affects young females aged 7–15 years and has a recovery rate of 78% if diagnosed and treated early but the duration of inpatient treatment may last up to 9.44 months (8.82 SD). The patients had multiple inter-dependent risks. The major predisposing factors included vulnerable premorbid personality and pre-existing mental disorder. Precipitating factors were stressors such as infection and traumatic experiences. Enmeshed parent–child relationship served as a maintaining factor. The themes of treatment approach are essentially rehabilitative: (1) working collaboratively with patient and family, (2) having access to multidisciplinary team, and (3) peer/group supervision.

We hypothesized that PSVPro ventilation mode would reduce consumption of anesthetic agents compared with pressure control ventilation (PCV). METHODS: Seventy children between three and eight years of age undergoing elective lower abdominal and urological surgery were randomized into PCV group (n = 35) or PSVPro group (n = 35). General anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and a Proseal LMA™ was inserted. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol infusion to maintain the entropy values between 40 and 60. In the PCV mode, the inspiratory pressure was adjusted to obtain an expiratory tidal volume of 8 mL·kg(−1) and a respiratory rate of 12–20/min. In the PSVPRO group, the flow trigger was set at 0.4 L·min(−1) and pressure support was adjusted to obtain expiratory tidal volume of 8 mL·kg(−1). Consumption of anesthetic agent was recorded as the primary outcome. Emergence time and discharge time were recorded as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The PSVPro group showed significant reduction in propofol consumption compared with the PCV group (mean difference, 33.3 µg(−1)·kg(−1)·min(−1); 95% confidence interval [CI], 24.2 to 42.2). There was decrease in the emergence time in the PSVPro group compared with the PCV group (mean difference, 3.5 min; 95% CI, 2.8 to 4.2) and in time to achieve modified Aldrete score > 9 (mean difference, 3.6 min; 95% CI, 1.9 to 5.2).

Neurological and cardiac manifestations have been well noted but complications such as status epilepticus and acute myocarditis with heart failure at presentation remains uncommon. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 15-year-old, previously healthy, South Asian, Sri Lankan female presented with status epilepticus and the seizures only responded to intravenous midazolam and thiopentone sodium. On the fourth day, she developed tachycardia and shortness of breath and was found to have cardiomyopathy with heart failure with an ejection fraction 40%. Along with a positive urinary sediment, a positive ANA with a very high level of ds-DNA and low C3 and C4 levels confirmed our suspicion of systemic lupus erythematosus. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: Systemic lupus erythematosus presents in a variety of clinical presentations and the spectrum may range from unique to ubiquitous. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion specially when encountering atypical presentations with multi-organ involvement, especially when patients tend to be young females. Status epilepticus and myocarditis are uncommon manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus, and should be appreciated early, as if inappropriately managed would have a deleterious impact on mortality and morbidity.","Herath, H.

This study proposed a novel and easy-to-calculate prediction score using clinical and point of care laboratory findings in patients with abdominal trauma (AT). METHODS: Patients with AT admitted to a trauma center in Qatar between 2014 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The FASILA score was proposed and calculated using focused assessment with sonography in trauma (0 = negative, 1 = positive), Shock Index (SI) (0 = 0.50–0.69, 1 = 0.70–0.79, 2 = 0.80–0.89, and 3 ≥ 0.90), and initial serum lactate (0 ≤ 2.0, 1 = 2.0–4.0, and 2 ≥ 4.0 mmol/l). Outcome variables included mortality, laparotomy, and massive blood transfusion (MT). FASILA was compared to other prediction scores using receiver operating characteristics and areas under the curves. Bootstrap procedure was employed for internal validation. RESULTS: In 1199 patients with a mean age of 31 ± 13.5 years, MT, MT protocol (MTP) activation, exploratory laparotomy (ExLap), and hospital mortality were related linearly with the FASILA score, Injury Severity Score, and total length of hospital stay. Initial hemoglobin, Revised Trauma Score (RTS), and Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS) were inversely proportional. FASILA scores correlated significantly with the Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) (r = 0.65), Revised Assessment of Bleeding and Transfusion (RABT) (r = 0.63), SI (r = 0.72), RTS (r = − 0.34), and Glasgow Coma Scale (r = − 0.32) and outperformed other predictive systems (RABT, ABC, and SI) in predicting MT, MTP, ExLap, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The novel FASILA score performs well in patients with abdominal trauma and offers advantages over other scores.

Firstly, a rumor propagation model with two language spreaders, in which the immunologic mechanism is considered in the ignorant, is proposed on heterogeneous networks. Secondly, the basic reproduction number and the dynamic behaviors are analyzed by using the next-generation matrix method and Lyapunov stability theory, respectively. Moreover, two control strategies are designed to effectively suppress the spread of the rumor. The one is continuous control strategy. By applying real-time control to the spreaders, the rumor spreading time can be greatly reduced and the rumor can die out in a short time. The other is event-triggered impulsive control strategy, which can effectively reduce the consumption of resources and ensure the extinction of the rumor. Finally, the correctness of theoretical analysis and the feasibility of control methods are verified by numerical simulations.","Yu, Shuzhen; Yu, Zhiyong; Jiang, Haijun; Mei, Xuehui; Li, Jiarong",Nonlinear Dyn,62,12

However, the lack of RNA targeting activities limits the ability of CRISPR/Cas9 to combat RNA viruses. The recently identified class II type VI CRISPR/Cas effectors (Cas13) are RNA-targeting CRISPR enzymes that enable RNA cleavage in mammalian and plant cells. We sought to knockdown the viral RNA of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) directly by exploiting the CRISPR/Cas13b system. Effective mRNA cleavage by CRISPR/Cas13b-mediated CRISPR RNA (crRNA) targeting the ORF5 and ORF7 genes of PRRSV was observed. To address the need for uniform delivery of the Cas13b protein and crRNAs, an all-in-one system expressing Cas13b and duplexed crRNA cassettes was developed. Delivery of a single vector carrying double crRNAs enabled the simultaneous knockdown of two PRRSV genes. Transgenic MARC-145 cells stably expressing the Cas13b effector and crRNA mediated by lentiviral-based transduction showed a robust ability to splice the PRRSV genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs; viral infection was almost completely abrogated by the combination of double crRNAs simultaneously targeting the ORF5 and ORF7 genes. Our study indicated that the CRISPR/Cas13b system can effectively knockdown the PRRSV genome in vitro and can potentially be used as a potent therapeutic antiviral strategy.","Cui, Jin; Techakriengkrai, Navapon; Nedumpun, Teerawut; Suradhat, Sanipa",Sci Rep,62,24

Many computational methods attempted to represent and fuse multiple omics into a comprehensive view of cancer. However, different types of omics are related and heterogeneous. Most of the existing methods do not consider the difference between omics, so the biological knowledge of individual omics may not be fully excavated. And for a given task (e.g. predicting overall survival), these methods prefer to use sample similarity or domain knowledge to learn a more reasonable representation of omics, but it’s not enough. METHODS: For the purpose of learning more useful representation for individual omics and fusing them to improve the prediction ability, we proposed an autoencoder-based method named MOSAE (Multi-omics Supervised Autoencoder). In our method, a specific autoencoder were designed for each omics according to their size of dimension to generate omics-specific representations. Then, a supervised autoencoder was constructed based on specific autoencoder by using labels to enforce each specific autoencoder to learn both omics-specific and task-specific representations. Finally, representations of different omics that generate from supervised autoencoders were fused in a traditional but powerful way, and the fused representation was used for subsequent predictive tasks. RESULTS: We applied our method over TCGA Pan-Cancer dataset to predict four different clinical outcome endpoints (OS, PFI, DFI, and DSS). Compared with traditional and state-of-the-art methods, MOSAE achieved better predictive performance. We also tested the effects of each improvement, which all have a positive effect on predictive performance. CONCLUSIONS: Predicting clinical outcome endpoints are very important for precision medicine and personalized medicine. And multi-omics fusion is an effective way to solve this problem. MOSAE is a powerful multi-omics fusion method, which can generate both omics-specific and task-specific representation for given endpoint predictive tasks and improve the predictive performance.","Tan, Kaiwen; Huang, Weixian; Hu, Jinlong; Dong, Shoubin",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,62,12

METHODS: We conducted a parallel group, double blind, 2 (active drug) :1 (placebo) randomized trial of oral oseltamivir/placebo or inhaled zanamivir/placebo over 16 weeks in healthy, Thai hospital professionals at two Bangkok hospitals. The primary endpoint was study withdrawal due to drug-related (possibly, probably, definitely) serious or adverse events (AEs) graded ≥2. RESULTS: Recruited subjects numbered 129 oseltamivir/65 placebo and 131 zanamivir/65 placebo.

The use of conservative as compared to liberal fluid strategies may increase the number of ventilator-free days and survival, as well as reduce organ dysfunction. Monitoring the effects of fluid administration is of the utmost importance; dynamic indexes, such as stroke volume and pulse pressure variations, outperform static ones, such as the central venous pressure. The passive leg raise and end-expiratory occlusion tests are recommended for guiding fluid management decisions. The type of intravenous fluids should also be taken into consideration: crystalloids, colloids, and human albumin have all been used for fluid resuscitation. Recent studies have also shown differences in outcome between balanced and non-balanced intravenous solutions. In preclinical studies, infusion of albumin promotes maintenance of the glycocalyx layer, reduces inflammation, and improves alveolar-capillary membrane permeability. Fluids in ARDS must be administered cautiously, considering hemodynamic and perfusion status, oncotic and hydrostatic pressures, ARDS severity, fluid type, volume and infusion rate, and cardiac and renal function. Of note, no guideline to date has recommended a specific fluid composition for use in ARDS; most physicians currently follow recommendations for sepsis.","Mendes, Renata de S.; Pelosi, Paolo; Schultz, Marcus J.; Rocco, Patricia R.

Two diagnostic entities are distinguished within PDOC: unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS, previously known as vegetative state) and minimally conscious state (MCS). Patients with PDOC may benefit from early intensive neurorehabilitation (EIN). In the Netherlands, the EIN programme is provided by one designated expert rehabilitation centre and forms the starting point of a dedicated chain of specialised rehabilitation and care for this group. This study project, called DOCTOR: Disorders of Consciousness; Treatment and Outcomes Registry, sets up a registry and systematically investigates multiple short- and long-term outcomes of patients with PDOC who receive EIN. METHODS: Single-centre prospective cohort study with a 2-year follow-up period. Patients with PDOC due to acute brain injury who receive EIN, aged 16 years and older are included. Measurements will take place at start EIN, in week 5, 10, and at discharge from the EIN programme (duration = max 14 weeks) and at week 28, 40, 52, and 104 after admission to the EIN programme, following patients through the health-care chain. Outcome measures are the changes over time in level of consciousness, using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised; the frequency and type of medical complications; the mortality rate; level of disability, including the level of motor, cognitive, behavioural and emotional functioning; participation; and quality of life. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy of caregivers, caregivers’ strain and cost-effectiveness of the programme. DISCUSSION: The DOCTOR study will provide insight in the recovery patterns and predictors of recovery for multiple outcomes in PDOC patients after following EIN. The results of the study will enable us to benchmark and improve EIN and the organisation of the health-care chain, both for patients with PDOC and for their families.

Two major cytotoxins, vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) and cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), interact closely with lipid rafts, contributing to H. pylori-associated disease progression. The Campylobacter jejuni cytolethal distending toxin consists of three subunits: CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC. Among them, CdtA and CdtC bind to membrane lipid rafts, which is crucial for CdtB entry into cells. In this study, we employed recombinant CdtC (rCdtC) to antagonize the functions of H. pylori cytotoxin in cells. Our results showed that rCdtC alleviates cell vacuolation induced by H. pylori VacA. Furthermore, rCdtC reduces H. pylori CagA translocation, which decreases nuclear factor kappa-B activation and interleukin-8 production, resulting in the mitigation of gastric epithelial cell inflammation.

Recently, the single-effector nuclease Cas12a that belongs to the type V CRISPR–Cas system was added to the Cas enzymes repertoire employed for gene editing purposes. Cas12a is a bilobal enzyme composed of the REC and Nuc lobe connected by the wedge, REC1 domain and bridge helix (BH). We generated BH variants and integrated biochemical and single-molecule FRET (smFRET) studies to elucidate the role of the BH for the enzymatic activity and conformational flexibility of Francisella novicida Cas12a. We demonstrate that the BH impacts the trimming activity and mismatch sensitivity of Cas12a resulting in Cas12a variants with improved cleavage accuracy. smFRET measurements reveal the hitherto unknown open and closed state of apo Cas12a. BH variants preferentially adopt the open state. Transition to the closed state of the Cas12a-crRNA complex is inefficient in BH variants but the semi-closed state of the ternary complex can be adopted even if the BH is deleted in its entirety. Taken together, these insights reveal that the BH is a structural element that influences the catalytic activity and impacts conformational transitions of FnCas12a.","Wörle, Elisabeth; Jakob, Leonhard; Schmidbauer, Andreas; Zinner, Gabriel; Grohmann, Dina",Nucleic Acids Res,62,12

However, the majority of people infected with ZIKV do not develop symptoms. The platforms aimed to specifically diagnose ZIKV infection are needed for patient care and public health surveillance. In the study, four ZIKV envelope (E) protein-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (A1, B1, C1, and 9E-1) have been developed by using the conventional mAb technology. The binding epitopes of mAbs A1, B1, C1, and 9E-1 are located at E(238-257), E(410-431), E(258-277), and E(340-356), respectively. mAb 9E-1 performs 1.4- to 47-fold strong affinity to ZIKV E protein compared to another three mAbs. mAbs A1, C1, and 9E-1 do not have cross-reactivity against the recombinant E proteins of dengue virus serotypes 2, 3, and 4. Although these four mAbs do not have ZIKV neutralizing activity, mAbs B1 and 9E-1 have been developed as the lateral flow immunochromatographic assay for specific detection of ZIKV E protein and virions. KEY POINTS: • The mAbs targeting to the regions of E(238-257), E(410-431), E(258-277), and E(340-356) do not have ZIKV neutralizing activity. • The binding epitope of mAb 9E-1 is highly specific to ZIKV E protein. • mAbs B1 and 9E-1 can bind to ZIKV virions and have been developed as the lateral flow immunochromatographic assay.","Li, Chia-Jung; Huang, Ping-Han; Chen, Hui-Wen; Chang, Shih-Chung",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,62,27

Total 7535 people from the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Etiology Research Center (CMERC), aged ≥ 50 years and residing in areas near Seoul, South Korea, were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Stressful life events in the past 6 months were gauged by the Life Experience Survey, and current depression symptoms were analyzed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Participants were categorized into the following four groups according to their past experience and depression status: reference, resilient, reactive depression, and vulnerable depression. Cognitive function was evaluated using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). The level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured from blood samples. A generalized linear model was used. Upon adjusting for socio-demographic factors, comorbidity, and lifestyle factors, the final model was stratified with the highest quartile of the hsCRP level by sex. Compared to the reference group, the resilient group showed higher MMSE, which was also significant in women (adj-β = 0.280, p-value < 0.001). Vulnerable depression group showed a significantly lower MMSE (adj-β = − -0.997, p-value 0.002), especially in men. This pattern seemed to be limited to the low hsCRP subgroup.

The integrin is overexpressed and activated in cancer cells, rapidly dividing endothelial cells, and platelets. The biologic result is that T4 at physiological concentration and without conversion to 3,3’,5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) may stimulate cancer cell proliferation and cancer-relevant angiogenesis and platelet coagulation. Pro-thrombotic activity of T4 on platelets is postulated to support cancer-linked blood clotting and to contribute to tumor cell metastasis. We examine some of these findings as they may relate to cancers of the thyroid. Differentiated thyroid cancer cells respond to physiological levels of T4 with increased proliferation. Thus, the possibility exists that in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinomas in whom T4 administration and consequent endogenous thyrotropin suppression have failed to arrest the disease, T4 treatment may be stimulating tumor cell proliferation. In vitro studies have shown that tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), a derivative of T4, acts via the integrin to block T4 support of thyroid cancer and other solid tumor cells. Actions of T4 and tetrac or chemically modified tetrac modulate gene expression in thyroid cancer cells. T4 induces radioresistance via induction of a conformational change in the integrin in various cancer cells, although not yet established in thyroid cancer cells. The thyroid hormone receptor on integrin αvβ3 mediates a number of actions of T4 on differentiated thyroid cancer cells that support the biology of the cancer. Additional studies are required to determine whether T4 acts on thyroid cancer cells.","Mousa, Shaker A.; Hercbergs, Aleck; Lin, Hung-Yun; Keating, Kelly A.; Davis, Paul J.",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),62,12

CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) is a bacterial defense system that inactivates the invading phage genome by introducing double-strand breaks at targeted sequences. While the mechanisms of CRISPR defense have been extensively investigated, the counterdefense mechanisms employed by phages are poorly understood. Here, we report a novel counterdefense mechanism by which phage T4 restores the genomes broken by CRISPR cleavages. Catalyzed by the phage-encoded recombinase UvsX, this mechanism pairs very short stretches of sequence identity (minihomology sites), as few as 3 or 4 nucleotides in the flanking regions of the cleaved site, allowing replication, repair, and stitching of genomic fragments. Consequently, a series of deletions are created at the targeted site, making the progeny genomes completely resistant to CRISPR attack. Our results demonstrate that this is a general mechanism operating against both type II (Cas9) and type V (Cas12a) CRISPR-Cas systems. These studies uncovered a new type of counterdefense mechanism evolved by T4 phage where subtle functional tuning of preexisting DNA metabolism leads to profound impact on phage survival.","Wu, Xiaorong; Zhu, Jingen; Tao, Pan; Rao, Venigalla B.",,62,12

The aim of this study was to see how systemic inflammation affects markers of neuroinflammation, if this inflammatory response had a temporal correlation between compartments and how different compartments differ in cytokine composition. METHODS: TBI patients recruited to a previous randomised controlled trial studying the effects of the drug anakinra (Kineret®), a human recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (rhIL1ra), were used (n = 10 treatment arm, n = 10 control arm). Cytokine concentrations were measured in arterial and jugular venous samples twice a day, as well as in microdialysis-extracted brain extracellular fluid (ECF) following pooling every 6 h. C-reactive protein level (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), temperature and confirmed systemic clinical infection were used as systemic markers of inflammation. Principal component analyses, linear mixed-effect models, cross-correlations and multiple factor analyses were used. RESULTS: Jugular and arterial blood held similar cytokine information content, but brain-ECF was markedly different. No clear arterial to jugular gradient could be seen. No substantial delayed temporal associations between blood and brain compartments were detected. The development of a systemic clinical infection resulted in a significant decrease of IL1-ra, G-CSF, PDGF-ABBB, MIP-1b and RANTES (p < 0.05, respectively) in brain-ECF, even if adjusting for injury severity and demographic factors, while an increase in several cytokines could be seen in arterial blood. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammation, and infection in particular, alters cytokine levels with different patterns seen in brain and in blood. Cerebral inflammatory monitoring provides independent information from arterial and jugular samples, which both demonstrate similar information content. These findings could present potential new treatment options in severe TBI patients, but novel prospective trials are warranted to confirm these associations.

The therapeutic use of phages (phage therapy) has regained attention in the last decades as an alternative strategy to treat infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. In clinical settings it is most likely that phages are administered adjunct to antibiotics. For successful phage therapy it is therefore crucial to investigate different phage-antibiotic combinations in vivo. This study aimed to elucidate the combinatorial effects of systemic daptomycin and nebulised bacteriophages for the treatment of experimental pneumonia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). RESULTS: Using a rat model of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by MRSA, the simultaneous application of intravenous daptomycin and nebulised phages was not superior to aerophage therapy alone at improving animal survival (55% vs. 50%), or reducing bacterial burdens in the lungs, or spleen. Thus, this combination does not seem to be of benefit for use in patients with MRSA pneumonia.","Valente, Luca G.; Federer, Lea; Iten, Manuela; Grandgirard, Denis; Leib, Stephen L.; Jakob, Stephan M.; Haenggi, Matthias; Cameron, David R.; Que, Yok-Ai; Prazak, Josef",BMC Res Notes,62,12

This case report describes a 3-month-old free-roaming female kitten, weighing 930 g, that developed hypersalivation, hypothermia, dyspnoea due to increased bronchial secretion, bradycardia, miosis and neurological signs, including restlessness, ataxia, disorientation, apparent hallucination, muscle twitching and seizures within 6 h of accidental ingestion of an insecticide containing chlorpyrifos (500 g/l) and cypermethrin (50 g/l). The kitten was treated empirically with intramuscular atropine and dexamethasone, and rectal diazepam. The history of insecticide exposure was obtained after 6 h of treatment and intramuscular 2-pyridine aldoxime methochloride (pralidoxime [2-PAM]) and atropine therapy was started 2 h later. Recovery was complicated by suspected aspiration, but there were no sequelae from the insecticide exposure and by 7 days post-ingestion the kitten was normal and playful. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of successful management of chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin toxicosis in a cat in Bangladesh. This case report suggests that 2-PAM followed by atropine and other supportive therapy may be an effective strategy to manage a cat poisoned by chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin; however, expanded clinical trials are needed.","Roy, Sawrab; Islam, Saiful; Alam, Shahrul; Ahmed, Juned; Chowdhury, Q M Monzur Kader",JFMS Open Rep,62,12

Various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been developed and are being used for vaccination worldwide. However, no therapeutic agents against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been developed so far; therefore, new therapeutic agents are urgently needed. In the present study, we evaluated several hepatitis C virus direct-acting antivirals as potential candidates for drug repurposing against COVID-19. Theses include asunaprevir (a protease inhibitor), daclatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), and sofosbuvir (an RNA polymerase inhibitor). We found that asunaprevir, but not sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, markedly inhibited SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects in Vero E6 cells. Both RNA and protein levels of SARS-CoV-2 were significantly decreased by treatment with asunaprevir. Moreover, asunaprevir profoundly decreased virion release from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. A pseudoparticle entry assay revealed that asunaprevir blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection at the binding step of the viral life cycle. Furthermore, asunaprevir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in human lung Calu-3 cells. Collectively, we found that asunaprevir displays broad-spectrum antiviral activity and therefore might be worth developing as a new drug repurposing candidate for COVID-19.","Lim, Yun-Sook; Nguyen, Lap P.; Lee, Gun-Hee; Lee, Sung-Geun; Lyoo, Kwang-Soo; Kim, Bumseok; Hwang, Soon B.",Mol Cells,62,12

This cross-sectional study aimed to identify factors associated with older adults’ participation in community-based health promotion activities. The Older Adults’ Health Promotion Activity Questionnaire was developed to collect data, and a total of 139 older adults were recruited from a community care center in Taoyuan City. Participants’ mean age was 72.7 years (SD = 6.0 years), 74.8% were females, 64.7% were married, 59% had a lower level of education, 51.8% had lower income, 59% reported their health status not good, and 76.3% had chronic disease. Our findings indicated that age, perceived benefits, and self-efficacy were identified as significant predictors of participation in health promotion activities. Among them, perceived benefits were found to have the strongest association with participation in health promotion activities (β = 0.305; p < 0.05). The findings showed that the Pender’s Health Promotion Model is useful to provide information for predicting and detecting significant factors related to older adults’ participation in community-based health promotion activities.

The chromatin organization changes in the cell cycle, and it conforms to various compaction levels. We investigated a chromatin solenoid model with nucleosomes shaped as cylindrical units arranged in a helical array. The solenoid with spherical-shaped nucleosomes was also modeled. The changes in chiral structural parameters of solenoid induced different compaction levels of chromatin fiber. We calculated the angle-resolved scattering of circularly polarized light to probe the changes in the organization of chromatin fiber in response to the changes in its chiral parameters. The electromagnetic scattering calculations were performed using discrete dipole approximation (DDA). In the chromatin structure, nucleosomes have internal interactions that affect chromatin compaction. The merit of performing computations with DDA is that it takes into account the internal interactions. We demonstrated sensitivity of the scattering signal’s angular behavior to the changes in these chiral parameters: pitch, radius, the handedness of solenoid, number of solenoid turns, the orientation of solenoid, the orientation of nucleosomes, number of nucleosomes, and shape of nucleosomes. These scattering calculations can potentially benefit applying a label-free polarized-light-based approach to characterize chromatin DNA and chiral polymers at the nanoscale level.","Ashraf, Muhammad Waseem; Le Gratiet, Aymeric; Diaspro, Alberto",Polymers (Basel),62,12

It is characterized by the progressive worsening of lung function and has a poor prognosis (median survival is approximately 3 years). However, the clinical course of disease shows considerable individual variability. Therefore, it is important to monitor the clinical course and to predict prognosis for optimal therapy. Serum biomarkers are both less invasive and reproducible diagnostic tools. Useful biomarkers for patients with IPF are strongly coveted; however, to date, there are no biomarkers that are globally known. In Japan, surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-D, and KL-6 are commonly used as serum markers of interstitial pneumonia, including IPF, in the clinical setting, and empirical data has been accumulated over 10 years. SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins and members of the collectin family. These collectins have been shown to function as host defense lectins in the lung. KL-6 is a high molecular weight glycoprotein and now classified as a human MUC1 mucin protein. These three proteins are mainly synthesized by alveolar type II cells. The mechanisms of increase for these protein levels in sera of patients with IPF are probably a combination of a loss of epithelial integrity due to injury and an increased mass of type II cells due to hyperplasia. It has been revealed that those proteins are useful for monitoring the clinical course and predicting prognosis as well as for the diagnosis of IPF. In this review article, the molecular structures and biological functions of these biomarkers are outlined, and we discuss the clinical application of these biomarkers for patients with IPF.","Chiba, Hirofumi; Takahashi, Hiroki",Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,62,12

For example, in recent years, highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza have emerged in Asia, spread through Eastern Europe, and threaten to become pandemic. As demonstrated by the coordinated response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and influenza, agents of infectious disease are being addressed via large-scale genomic sequencing. The goal of genomic sequencing projects are to rapidly put large amounts of data in the public domain to accelerate research on disease surveillance, treatment, and prevention. However, our ability to derive information from large comparative genomic datasets lags far behind acquisition. Here we review the computational challenges of comparative genomic analyses, specifically sequence alignment and reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. We present novel analytical results on two important infectious diseases, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and influenza. SARS and influenza have similarities and important differences both as biological and comparative genomic analysis problems. Influenza viruses (Orthymxyoviridae) are RNA based. Current evidence indicates that influenza viruses originate in aquatic birds from wild populations. Influenza has been studied for decades via well-coordinated international efforts. These efforts center on surveillance via antibody characterization of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (N) proteins of the circulating strains to inform vaccine design. However, we still do not have a clear understanding of (1) various transmission pathways such as the role of intermediate hosts like swine and domestic birds and (2) the key mutation and genomic recombination events that underlie periodic pandemics of influenza. In the past 30 years, sequence data from HA and N loci has become an important data type. In the past year, full genomic data has become prominent. These data present exciting opportunities to address unanswered questions in influenza pandemics. SARS is caused by a previously unrecognized lineage of coronavirus, SARS-CoV, which like influenza has an RNA based genome. Although SARS-CoV is widely believed to have originated in animals, there remains disagreement over the candidate animal source that lead to the original outbreak of SARS. In contrast to the long history of the study of influenza, SARS was only recognized in late 2002 and the virus that causes SARS has been documented primarily by genomic sequencing. In the past, most studies of influenza were performed on a limited number of isolates and genes suited to a particular problem. Major goals in science today are to understand emerging diseases in broad geographic, environmental, societal, biological, and genomic contexts. Synthesizing diverse information brought together by various researchers is important to find out what can be done to prevent future outbreaks [JON03]. Thus comprehensive means to organize and analyze large amounts of diverse information are critical. For example, the relationships of isolates and patterns of genomic change observed in large datasets might not be consistent with hypotheses formed on partial data. Moreover when researchers rely on partial datasets, they restrict the range of possible discoveries. Phylogenetics is well suited to the complex task of understanding emerging infectious disease. Phylogenetic analyses can test many hypotheses by comparing diverse isolates collected from various hosts, environments, and points in time and organizing these data into various evolutionary scenarios. The products of a phylogenetic analysis are a graphical tree of ancestor–descendent relationships and an inferred summary of mutations, recombination events, host shifts, geographic, and temporal spread of the viruses. However, this synthesis comes at a price. The cost of computation of phylogenetic analysis expands combinatorially as the number of isolates considered increases. Thus, large datasets like those currently produced are commonly considered intractable. We address this problem with synergistic development of heuristics tree search strategies and parallel computing.","Janies, D.; Pol, D.",Tutorials in Mathematical Biosciences IV,62,12

Infection of humans with globally circulating human coronaviruses is associated with the common cold. In contrast, transmission of animal coronaviruses to humans can result in severe disease: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are responsible for hundreds of deaths in Asia and the Middle East, respectively, and are both caused by members of the genus Betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV that were zoonotically transmitted from an animal host to humans. At present, neither vaccines nor specific treatment is available to combat coronavirus infection in humans, and novel antiviral strategies are urgently sought. The viral spike protein (S) mediates the first essential step in coronavirus infection, viral entry into target cells. For this, the S protein critically depends on priming by host cell proteases, and the responsible enzymes are potential targets for antiviral intervention. Recent studies revealed that the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L and the serine proteases furin and TMPRSS2 prime the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and provided evidence that successive S protein cleavage at two sites is required for S protein priming. Moreover, mechanisms that control protease choice were unraveled, and insights were obtained into which enzyme promotes viral spread in the host. Here, we will provide basic information on S protein function and proteolytic priming, and we will then discuss recent progress in our understanding of the priming of the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.","Hoffmann, Markus; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Activation of Viruses by Host Proteases,62,12

Although our knowledge regarding the health effects of RF radiation has increased considerably, the scientific evidence on biological effects of RF radiation associated with these wireless devices is still tentative. The uncertainties persist, in part, because of the limited number and scope of studies that have been conducted. Aside from the lack of a scientific consensus on experimental studies that provide clear evidence either refuting or supporting the cancer induction or promotion potential of RF radiation from cell phones, there is a concern that an established effect from wireless radiation, however small, could have a considerable impact in terms of public health. This chapter provides an updated review on recent research results on cancer induction and promotion in normal and transgenic mice and rats subjected to prolonged or life-long exposure to modulation schemes such as GSM, TDMA, CDMA, UMTS, and others. A majority of the laboratory mouse and rat studies did not exhibit a significant difference in carcinogenic incidences between exposed and sham-exposed animals. Although this observation may be comforting from the perspective of safety evaluation, most of the studies are one-of-a-kind investigations – only three mouse and perhaps four rat studies were designed as replication or confirmation studies. It is noteworthy that the findings of these studies have not been consistent, making it difficult to arrive at a definitive conclusion. It could be a major flaw that in a majority of the investigations, cage-control animals were not part of the investigation or were not included in the data analyses. Moreover, restraining the experimental animals during exposure could have introduced a stress factor, which further complicates interpretation of the results since stress has often been associated with cancer induction in these animals.","Lin, James C.",Advances in Electromagnetic Fields in Living Systems,62,12

Amid all SPVs, porcine sapeloviruses (PSVs) are more ubiquitously present all over the world in porcine population. These viruses are highly stable in different environmental conditions and spread easily within the susceptible animals mainly through faeco-oral route. Usually, PSVs cause asymptomatic infections but are also clinically associated with encephalomyelitis, respiratory distress, fertility disorders and skin lesions. PSV-associated outbreaks have been reported where death occurs due to polioencephalitis and respiratory paralysis. Till date, PSVs have been detected from several European and Asian countries with moderate-to-high prevalence and clinical course. Viral capsid proteins are immunogenic and mutations in these proteins are responsible for the diverse nature of the viruses. Further, genomic analysis shows the varied evolutionary patterns and the presence of recombination within PSV strains. These viruses also exist as concurrent infections with several enteric bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens. Classical to modern biotechnological assays are in use to detect PSV involving virus isolation in cell culture, immunohistochemistry, conventional nucleic acid amplification techniques, quantitative real-time amplification assays and isothermal amplification molecular techniques. Till date, there is no vaccine available against PSVs.","Malik, Yashpal Singh; Bhat, Sudipta; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Wang, Fun-In; Touil, Nadia; Ghosh, Souvik; Dhama, Kuldeep; Yadav, Mahendra Pal; Singh, Raj Kumar",Emerging and Transboundary Animal Viruses,62,12

It is a compulsory laboratory skill to conduct research related in the field of microbiology. Mycologist/microbiologists must follow aseptic techniques for multiplicity procedures such as screening of isolates/strains, pure cultures, slant cultures, single spore cultures, microbes transferring cultures, inoculating media, and conducting several microbiological experiments. Proper aseptic technique has prevented the cultures contamination from inborn and outborn microbes in the environment. As example, airborne microbes (e.g., fungi) handpicked from the surveyor’s health, the lab benchtop, unsterilized glassware and equipment, dust, and other areas, thus interfering to get proper experiment results.

Without vaccines, the population—particularly children—would be troubled with multitudinous infectious diseases such as diphtheria, scarlet fever, whooping cough, and measles, just to name a few. Vaccines are available against both viral and bacterial infections; they have saved millions of lives and continue to do so. The World Health Organization hopes to have vaccinated all children under a year old against most infectious diseases by 2020. The history of the public’s acceptance of vaccines has been a stormy one. Anti-vaccination movements have been active since the creation or development of the smallpox vaccine in the eighteenth century and in government-mandated vaccination until the present. An example of this is the fabricated information spread about the relationship between measles vaccine and autism. A successful polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s thanks to the research of three groups, led by Koprowski, Salk and Sabin, although each of these vaccines has its advantages and disadvantages. An oral vaccine has the advantage of ease of administration and a herd effect. Polio vaccine workers have become targets of extremists in Nigeria and Pakistan. Recently, recombinant DNA technology, was used to develop new vaccines in order to avoid the side effects, since live virus is not involved. The future may see the production of vaccines in edible plants, allowing for cheap production and ease in worldwide distribution.","Taylor, Milton W.",Viruses and Man: A History of Interactions,62,12

This qualitative research has revealed differences in the perceptions, experiences, and understandings of evidence-based practice among public health professionals from different backgrounds across different services in health care and local government in England. The absence of a strong tradition of evidence-based practice in environmental health appears to be a disadvantage in securing funding and playing a full role, as it has become the expectation in the new public health system. This has, at times, resulted in tensions between professionals with different backgrounds and frustration on the part of environmental health practitioners, who have a tradition of responding quickly to new challenges and “getting on with the job.” There is generally a willingness to develop evidence-based practice in environmental health; however, this will take time and investment.","Dhesi, Surindar; Stewart, Jill",Sage Open,62,12

It can be labor-intensive for a scientist to analyze changes across space and time in such maps, even after they have been digitized and converted to a vector format. In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach that converts vector data of geographic features extracted from multiple historical maps into linked spatio-temporal data. The resulting graphs can be easily queried and visualized to understand the changes in specific regions over time. We evaluate our technique on railroad network data extracted from USGS historical topographic maps for several regions over multiple map sheets and demonstrate how the automatically constructed linked geospatial data enables effective querying of the changes over different time periods.","Shbita, Basel; Knoblock, Craig A.; Duan, Weiwei; Chiang, Yao-Yi; Uhl, Johannes H.; Leyk, Stefan",The Semantic Web,62,12

We showed that our recent superhydrophobic nanocomposites has the potential of encapsulating and suppressing the virus so as to limit its transmission and spread. In this study, we examine the durability of the newly developed surfaces when subjected to elevated temperature, chemical attack and mechanical damage in the form of abrasion and compressive load. Extensive tests were conducted to reveal the effect of these parameters on the surface performance. Three aspects of the work were accordingly examined. The first was concerned with controlled thermal stability tests in which the surfaces were subjected to elevated temperatures approaching 350 °C for silicone-based nanocomposites and 150 °C for epoxy-based nanocomposites. The second was concerned with subjecting the surfaces to alkaline and acidic solutions with pH concentrations ranging between 1 and 13. Finally, the third involved surface damage by abrasion tests. Our results show clearly that the newly developed superhydrophobic surfaces are capable of resisting the adverse effects of thermal and chemical attacks as well as mechanical abrasion owing to the excellent structural stability and mechanical properties of the constituents of the nanocomposite. Moreover, our superhydrophobic monolith demonstrated exceptional regenerative capabilities even after being subjected to damaging compressive stresses of up to 10 MPa.","Elzaabalawy, Assem; Meguid, S.

AJSAF is a purified active saponin fraction from the stem bark of Albizzia julibrissin. In this study, AJSAF was evaluated for the adjuvant potentials on immune responses to inactivated H9N2 avian influenza virus vaccine (IH9V) in mice and chicken in comparison with commercially oil-adjuvant. RESULTS: AJSAF significantly induced faster and higher H9 subtype avian influenza virus antigen (H9–Ag)-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b antibody titers in mice and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and IgY antibody levels in chicken immunized with IH9V. AJSAF also markedly promoted Con A-, LPS- and H9–Ag-stimulated splenocyte proliferation and natural killer cell activity. Furthermore, AJSAF significantly induced the production of both Th1 (IL-2 and IFN-γ) and Th2 (IL-10) cytokines, and up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines and transcription factors in splenocytes from the IH9V-immunized mice. Although oil-formulated inactivated H9N2 avian influenza vaccine (CH9V) also elicited higher H9–Ag-specific IgG and IgG1 in mice and HI antibody titer in chicken, this robust humoral response was later produced. Moreover, serum IgG2a and IgG2b antibody titers in CH9V-immunized mice were significantly lower than those of IH9V alone group. CONCLUSIONS: AJSAF could improve antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, and simultaneously trigger a Th1/Th2 response to IH9V. AJSAF might be a safe and efficacious adjuvant candidate for H9N2 avian influenza vaccine.

In this manuscript, for children with Down syndrome and hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, we will summarize the epidemiology of heart defects that warrant intervention. We will review perioperative planning for this unique population, including anesthetic considerations, common postoperative issues, nutritional strategies, and discharge planning. Special considerations for single ventricle palliation and heart transplantation evaluation will also be discussed. Overall, the risk of mortality with cardiac surgery in pediatric patients with Down syndrome is no more than the general population, except for those with functional single ventricle heart defects.

The goals of the current research were to identify different latent diet profiles in children based on their food consumption and to assess the relationship between profiles and family-related factors. A total of 678 school-aged children from the fifth and sixth grades participated. The study design was cross-sectional and questionnaire based. Research assessed healthy (fruit and vegetables) and unhealthy (fast food, sugar-sweetened beverages, and candies) food consumption and family-related factors. A latent profile analysis and multivariate data analysis were developed. Four diet profiles were identified: Combined Diet, Mainly Healthy Diet, Mainly Unhealthy Diet, and Very Unhealthy Diet. Nearly half of the children (45.22%) showed a Combined Diet profile, meaning that they reported eating nearly the same amount of healthy and unhealthy types of foods. Associations between the diet profiles, family income, and food availability were found. For example, the Mainly Healthy Diet profile was statistically associated with a higher family income and less access to unhealthy foods. The present study reinforces the idea that profiling diets can allow for a tailored healthy eating intervention model according to the specific needs of each diet profile.","Pereira, Beatriz; Silva, Cátia; Núñez, José Carlos; Rosário, Pedro; Magalhães, Paula",Nutrients,62,1

The high mortality rate of COVID-19 is speculated to be related to immune damage. METHODS: In this study, clinical bioinformatics analysis was conducted on transcriptome data of coronavirus infection. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the complex immune injury induced by coronavirus infection provoked dysfunction of numerous immune-related molecules and signaling pathways, including immune cells and toll-like receptor cascades. Production of numerous cytokines through the Th17 signaling pathway led to elevation in plasma levels of cytokines (including IL6, NF-κB, and TNF-α) followed by concurrent inflammatory storm, which mediates the autoimmune response. Several novel medications seemed to display therapeutic effects on immune damage associated with coronavirus infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Outbreak si mulations for the COVID-19 pandemic are performed, using stochastic equations under the following assumptions: a pre-quarantine population R0 of 2.7 or 3.5, a post-quarantine R0 of 1.5, 2 or 2.7, 18% or 40%, of asymptomatic positives and a maximum response capacity of 50 or 150 patients in the intensive care units. The success of isolation and contact tracing is evaluated, no other mitigation measures are included. RESULTS In the pre-quarantine stage, success in controlling more than 80% of the simulations occurred only if the isolation of positive cases was implemented from the first case, after which there was less than 40% probability of success. In post-quarantine, with 60 positive cases it is necessary to isolate them early, track all of their contacts and decrease the R0 to 1.5 for outbreak control to be successful in more than 80% of cases. Other scenarios have a low probability of success. CONCLUSIONS The control of the outbreak in Peru during pre-quarantine stage demanded requirements that were difficult to comply with, therefore quarantine was necessary; to successfully suspend it would require a significant reduction in the spread of the disease, early isolation of positives and follow-up of all contacts of positive patients.","Huamaní, Charles; Timaná-Ruiz, Raúl; Pinedo, Jairo; Pérez, Jhelly; Vásquez, Luis",Revista peruana de medicina experimental y salud publica,62,27

However, the cellular mechanism underlying intestinal regeneration remains unclear. Using lineage tracing, we show that cells marked by an Msi1 reporter (Msi1+) are right above Lgr5high cells in intestinal crypts and exhibit DNA damage resistance. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that the Msi1+ cells are heterogeneous with the majority being intestinal stem cells (ISCs). The DNA damage-resistant subpopulation of Msi1+ cells is characterized by low-to-negative Lgr5 expression and is more rapidly cycling than Lgr5high radiosensitive crypt base columnar stem cells (CBCs). This enables an efficient repopulation of the intestinal epithelium at early stage when Lgr5high cells are not emerging. Furthermore, relative to CBCs, Msi1+ cells preferentially produce Paneth cells during homeostasis and upon radiation repair. Together, we demonstrate that the DNA damage-resistant Msi1+ cells are cycling ISCs that maintain and regenerate the intestinal epithelium.","Sheng, Xiaole; Lin, Ziguang; Lv, Cong; Shao, Chunlei; Bi, Xueyun; Deng, Min; Xu, Jiuzhi; Guerrero-Juarez, Christian F; Li, Mengzhen; Wu, Xi; Zhao, Ran; Yang, Xu; Li, Guilin; Liu, Xiaowei; Wang, Qingyu; Nie, Qing; Cui, Wei; Gao, Shan; Zhang, Hongquan; Liu, Zhihua; Cong, Yingzi; Plikus, Maksim V; Lengner, Christopher J; Andersen, Bogi; Ren, Fazheng; Yu, Zhengquan",Cell reports,62,12

METHODS Twenty-eight patients symptomatic for and diagnosed with evaporative dry eye (16 test patients and 12 controls), who also evidenced anteroplacement and a thickened LOM, were enrolled and consented. SYMPTOMS were evaluated with the Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness questionnaire. The MG function was evaluated with the standardized MG function evaluator. The LOM was stained with lissamine green (Odyssey Medical, TN) for evaluation. For the test group only, the stained LOM and the entire width of the keratinized lower lid margin were debrided-scaled using a stainless steel, foreign body, golf club spud (Hilco Wilson Ophthalmics, Plainville, MA). All the patients were monitored for change in symptoms and MG function approximately 1 month later. RESULTS The mean ages of the patients were 55.9 ± 15.0 years (test) versus 53.7 ± 15.3 years (control). There was a significant improvement in the symptoms and MG function 1 month post-debridement-scaling in the test group. The controls evidenced no significant change in either parameter. SYMPTOMS baseline mean pre-debridement-scaling: 13.4 ± 4.6 (test) versus 13.9 ± 5.5 (control); 1 month post-debridement-scaling: 10.5 ± 3.8 (test, population level statistic < 0.0001) versus 14.3 ± 7.5 (control, population level statistic > 0.05). Number of functional MGs: baseline mean pre-debridement-scaling: 2.6 ± 1.3 (test) versus 2.7 ± 1.5 (control); 1 month post-debridement-scaling: 3.8 ± 1.4 (test, P = 0.0007) versus 2.4 ± 1.1 (control, P > 0.05). Only data for the right eye are reported. CONCLUSIONS The debridement-scaling of the LOM and lower lid margin provides statistically significant symptom relief and improvement in the MG function. The novel procedure should be considered in the management of MGD and evaporative dry eye.","Korb, Donald R; Blackie, Caroline A",Cornea,62,27

Previous studies reported mixed results regarding clinical outcome during quarantine in patients with migraine. In particular, data from areas strongly affetcted by COVID-19 pandemic are missing. METHODS One-hundred and seventy patients, previously assessed at the Headache Centre - ASST Spedali Civili Brescia, underwent a telephonic interview regarding migraine features and clinical, occupational and lifestyle variables. RESULTS Compared to baseline, during quarantine, we found a significant overall reduction in migraine days (14.7±0.6 vs 12.3±0.7, p <0.001), with 47.1% patients reporting a clinical improvement. Outdoor living spaces (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.7-3.07, p = 0.009), a positive attitude throughout quarantine (OR 4.12, 95% CI 2.3-7.1, p = 0.03), working full-time (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.5-1.9, p < 0.001) and a baseline diagnosis of chronic migraine (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-2.02, p = 0.002) were associated with an increased chance of migraine improvement. Being single (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.01, p = 0.05) and physical inactivity (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6, p = 0.02) were associated with an increased risk of worsening. CONCLUSIONS Quarantine had an overall positive impact on migraine. Based on our results, we hypothesize the reduction of daily hassles and challenges might be the main reason for such improvement.","di Cola, Francesca Schiano; Caratozzolo, Salvatore; Di Cesare, Marco; Liberini, Paolo; Rao, Renata; Padovani, Alessandro",Pain medicine,62,31

We aimed: 1) to examine the change in proportions of EMS personnel reporting awareness of and training in PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic; and 2) to determine factors associated with reporting these outcomes. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data collected from October 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 from currently working, nationally certified EMS personnel (n = 15,339), assessing N95 respirator fit testing; training in air purified respirators (APR) or powered APR (PAPR) use; and training on PPE use for chemical, biological, and nuclear (CBN) threats. We used an interrupted time series analysis to determine changes in proportions of EMS personnel reporting training per week, using the date of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) initial EMS guidance (February 6, 2020) as the interruption. We fit multivariable logistic regression models to understand factors associated with each outcome. Results: We found high awareness of N95 respirators (99%) and APR/PAPR (91%), but only 61% reported N95 fit testing and 64% reported training on PPE for CBN threats in the prior 12 months. There was a significant, positive slope change after CDC guidance for N95 respirator fit testing, and significant post-interruption mean increases for fit testing (0.9%, 95% CI 0.6-1.1%), APR/PAPR training (0.3%, 95% CI 0.2-0.5%), and PPE for CBN threats training (0.6%, 95% CI 0.3-0.9%). Factors consistently associated with lower odds of awareness/training included part-time employment, providing 9-1-1 response service, working at a non-fire-based EMS agency, and working in a rural setting. Conclusions: CDC guidance on COVID-19 for EMS may have increased N95 fit testing and training, but there remain substantial gaps in training on PPE use among EMS personnel. As the pandemic continues in our communities, EMS agencies should be supported in efforts to adequately prepare their staff.","Cash, Rebecca E; Rivard, Madison K; Camargo, Carlos A; Powell, Jonathan R; Panchal, Ashish R",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,62,31

Released cytokines and oxidative stress following acute liver damage may affect other organs' function notably the diaphragm, which is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress and circulating cytokines. We addressed this issue in a mouse model of acute liver injury induced by administration of APAP. C57BL/6J mice (each n = 8) were treated with N-acetyl-para-amino phenol (APAP) to induce acute drug caused liver injury and sacrificed 12 or 24 h afterwards. An untreated group served as controls. Key markers of inflammation, proteolysis, autophagy and oxidative stress were measured in diaphragm samples. In APAP treated animals, liver damage was proven by the enhanced serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. In the diaphragm, besides a significant increase in IL 6 and lipid peroxidation, no changes were observed in key markers of the proteolytic, and autophagy signaling pathways, other inflammatory markers and fiber dimensions. The first 24 h of acute liver damage did not impair diaphragm atrophic pathways although it slightly enhanced IL-6 and lipid peroxidation. Whether longer exposure might affect the diaphragm needs to be addressed in future experiments.","Bruells, C S; Duschner, P; Marx, G; Gayan-Ramirez, G; Frank, N; Breuer, T; Krenkel, O; Tacke, F; Mossanen, J C",Scientific reports,62,16

Early cholecystectomy has many reported advantages. Operation-related morbidity and mortality have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, our aim is to present our general clinical approach to patients who were diagnosed with AC during the pandemic and our percutaneous cholecystostomy experience during this period. METHODS This study included 72 patients who were presented to our hospital's emergency room between March 11 and May 31, 2020, with AC. Patients were divided into three groups based on their treatment: outpatients (Group 1), inpatients (Group 2) and patients undergoing percutaneous cholecystostomy (Group 3). These three groups were compared by their demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS There were 36 (50%) patients in Group 1, 25 (34.7%) patients in Group 2, and 11 (15.3%) patients in Group 3. The demographic characteristics of the patients were similar. The CRP and WBC levels of the patients in Group 3 were significantly higher compared to the other groups. Moreover, the wall of the gallbladder was thicker and the size of the gallbladder was larger in Group 3. Patients had percutaneous cholecystostomy at the median of 3.5 days and the length of hospital stay was longer compared to Group 2 (3.9 days versus 9.2 days, p=0.00). The rate of re-hospitalization after discharge was similar in Group 2 and Group 3, but none of the patients in Group 1 required hospitalization. None of 72 patients developed an emergency condition requiring surgery, and there was no death. CONCLUSION Although many publications emphasize that laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) can be performed with low morbidity at the first admission in acute cholecystitis, it is a clinical condition that can be delayed in the COVID-19 pandemic and other similar emergencies. Thus, percutaneous cholecystostomy should be effectively employed, and its indications should be extended if necessary (e.g., younger patients, patients with lower CCI or ASA). This approach may enable us to protect both patients and healthcare professionals that perform the operation from the risk of COVID-19.","Çiyiltepe, Hüseyin; Yıldırım, Gülşah; Fersahoğlu, Mehmet Mahir; Aydın, M Timuçin; Özcabı, Yetkin; Bulut, Nuriye Esen; Taşdelen, İksan; Fersahoğlu, Ayşe Tuba; Yananlı, Zühal Demirhan; Aydın, İbrahim; Ağca, Birol; Karakaş, Hakkı Muammer; Akyüz, Umit; Memisoğlu, Kemal",Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES,62,27

METHODS Formulations of TXA alone and with different concentrations of HA were freeze-dried and characterised according to their physicochemical properties. Aerosol performance was assessed to ensure nasal deposition with minimal lung deposition. Nasal epithelial cells were used to assess cytotoxicity, transport across the nasal epithelium, antioxidant, wound-healing and anti-inflammatory properties of all formulations. RESULTS Formulations containing TXA and HA were produced and found to be mostly deposited in the nasal cavity (more than 90%). Formulation of TXA + 0.3%HA showed wound reduction of 29.3% when assessed in ALI culture. At this concentration, formulations also reduced ROS production in RPMI 2650, and IL-8 production in primary nasal epithelial cells. Furthermore, for formulations containing HA, the higher viscosity may lead to larger residence time in the nasal cavity. CONCLUSIONS Combination of TXA with HA shows promising results for the treatment of nasal epistaxis.","Gomes Dos Reis, Larissa; Ghadiri, Maliheh; Young, Paul; Traini, Daniela",Pharmaceutical research,62,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement to obtain written informed consent was waived. Of 1579 patients with 1661 aneurysms, 395 patients (25.0%) with 403 aneurysms (24.3%) treated with stent-assisted coil placement were included and assigned to groups stratified as early (126 patients [31.9%]; 3 months of coil placement), midterm (160 patients [40.5%]; 6 months), or late (109 patients [27.6%]; ≥ 9 months), according to the time points of switching dual antiplatelet therapy to monotherapy from coil placement. Cumulative rates of delayed ischemic stroke in each group were calculated by using Kaplan-Meier estimates that were compared with log-rank tests. Risk factors of delayed ischemic stroke were identified by using Cox proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS Delayed ischemic stroke occurred in 3.5% of all cases (embolism, 3.0%; thrombotic occlusion, 0.5%) within 2 months following the switch. Late switch yielded no delayed ischemic stroke, unlike early (seven of 126 patients [5.6%]; P = .013) or midterm (seven of 160 patients [4.4%]; P = .028) switch. Incomplete occlusion (hazard ratio, 6.68 [95% confidence interval: 1.490, 29.900]) was identified as a risk factor. CONCLUSION Delayed ischemic stroke after stent-assisted coil placement is caused by embolism from or thrombotic occlusion of stent-containing vessels after switching from dual antiplatelet therapy to monotherapy. The stent-containing vessel with incomplete aneurysm occlusion presents as a long-term thromboembolic source. Therefore, dual antiplatelet therapy for more than 9 months and late switch to monotherapy are recommended for its prevention.","Hwang, Gyojun; Kim, Jeong Gyun; Song, Kyung Sun; Lee, Young Jin; Villavicencio, Jay Bautista; Suroto, Nur Setiawan; Park, Nam-Mi; Park, Soo Joo; Jeong, Eun-A; Kwon, O-Ki",Radiology,62,31

METHODS We evaluated patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing emergency PCI with serial biomarkers. RESULTS Of the 390 patients enrolled in the HORIZONS-AMI biomarker substudy, 56 (14.3%) developed AKI. In the AKI group, the levels of B-type natriuretic peptide were consistently higher than in the no-AKI group at baseline (P = 0.0327), hospital discharge (P = 0.0002), 30-day follow-up (P = 0.0193), and 1-year follow-up (P = 0.031). At hospital discharge, the AKI group had elevated biomarkers compared to the no-AKI group: D-dimer (P = 0.0066), C-reactive protein (P = 0.0468), endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (P = 0.0169), adiponectin (P = 0.0346), and von Willebrand factor (P = 0.0168); there was also a trend toward higher cystatin C (P = 0.0585) in the AKI group. Similar correlations between biomarker panel increase and the development of CI-AKI were consistent at baseline, 30-day, and 1-year follow-up. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 23 showed an opposite pattern with an increase at all time points in the no-AKI compared to the AKI group. CONCLUSIONS The risk of CI-AKI after primary PCI for STEMI may be associated with hemostatic imbalances, activation of procoagulants, decreased endogenous anticoagulants, enhanced inflammation, platelet activation, or decreased fibrinolytic activity.","Guerchicoff, Alejandra; Stone, Gregg W; Mehran, Roxana; Xu, Ke; Nichols, Dru; Claessen, Bimmer E; Guagliumi, Giulio; Witzenbichler, Bernhard; Henriques, José P S; Dangas, George D",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,62,19

The intestinal barrier's functions were also evaluated by measuring the serum recovery of fluorescein isothiocyanate-4kD dextran in this study. The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory mediators, oxidative reactions, as well as apoptotic marker proteins, were determined to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of puerarin on intestinal mucositis. The model mice presented symptoms and histopathological changes typical of 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis. In addition to vigorous inflammatory reactions, oxidative reactions and cell apoptosis, Janus kinase (JAK) was markedly activated. Puerarin decreased the expression levels of those of inflammatory mediators, oxidative reactions, and apoptosis-related proteins in 5-FU-induced mucositis by blocking the activation of JAK. Puerarin decreased inflammation, oxidative reactions and apoptosis, and protected intestinal barrier functions, to ameliorate 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis by inhibiting the activation of JAK. This study provides novel insights into the pathological mechanisms of, and treatment alternatives for, 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis. Significance Statement This study reveals the mechanism responsible for the protective effects of puerarin in 5-fluorouracil-induced intestinal mucositis. Puerarin inhibits the activation of JAK, thereby suppressing inflammation, oxidative reactions, cell apoptosis, and protected intestinal barrier functions, to ameliorate 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis. Overall, our results suggest that puerarin can serve as a potential natural JAK inhibitor in the treatment of 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis.","Wang, Liang; Song, Baohui; Hu, Yan; Chen, Jun; Zhang, Shuaishuai; Chen, Dapeng; Wang, Jingyu",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,62,1

The peptides bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) resulting in elevated cAMP and/or phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover. In contrast, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) or neuregulin (NRG)-1 bind to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as the EGFR or HER3, increasing tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in the phosphorylation of protein substrates such as PI3K or phospholipase (PL)C. Peptide GPCRs can transactivate numerous RTKs, especially members of the EGFR/HER family resulting in increased phosphorylation of ERK, leading to cellular proliferation or increased phosphorylation of AKT, leading to cellular survival. GRCR antagonists and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are useful agents to prevent RTK transactivation and inhibit proliferation of cancer cells.","Moody, Terry W; Ramos-Alvarez, Irene; Jensen, Robert T",Peptides,62,4

Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and operative venous thrombectomy have been safely and effectively used in nonpregnant patients, demonstrating significant reduction in post-thrombotic morbidity. This report reviews short- and long-term outcomes of 13 patients with extensive DVT of pregnancy treated with a strategy of thrombus removal. METHODS From 1999 to 2013, 13 patients with iliofemoral DVT during pregnancy were offered CDT, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (PMT), and/or venous thrombectomy. Gestational age ranged from 8 to 34 weeks. Fetal monitoring was performed throughout hospitalization. Radiation exposure was minimized with pelvic lead shields, focal fluoroscopy, and limited angiographic runs. Follow-up included objective vein evaluation using venous duplex and PTS assessment using the Villalta scale. RESULTS CDT and/or PMT were used in 11 patients. Two patients underwent venous thrombectomy alone, and one patient had operative thrombectomy as an adjunct to CDT and PMT. Each patient had complete or near-complete thrombus resolution and rapid improvement in clinical symptoms. Eight of 11 having CDT or PMT underwent venoplasty and stenting of the involved iliac veins. Twelve of the 13 delivered healthy infants at term. One patient opted for termination of her pregnancy. Mean patient and gestational ages were 26 years and 26 weeks, respectively. Mean follow-up was 1.3 years, with only one recurrence. Duplex ultrasonography demonstrated patent veins in all but one patient and normal valve function in 10 patients. Eleven patients had Villalta scores <5 (considered normal), with a mean score of 0.7. CONCLUSIONS Extensive DVT of pregnancy can be effectively and safely treated with a strategy of thrombus removal, resulting in a patent venous system, normal valve function in many, prevention of PTS, and reduction in recurrence.","Herrera, Santiago; Comerota, Anthony J; Thakur, Subhash; Sunderji, Shiraz; DiSalle, Robert; Kazanjian, Sahira N; Assi, Zakaria",Journal of vascular surgery,62,19

METHODS Two hundred and eighteen consecutive women, aged 18-65, with newly diagnosed, untreated endocrine disorders were referred for potential diagnosis of co-morbid axis-I disorders with the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I-Patient Edition (SCID-P). The SCID-P was re-administered after 12 weeks. RESULTS At baseline, 64 (29.3%) women met criteria for at least one axis-I disorder. Women who were diagnosed with hyperthyroidism were more likely to meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder than women without hyperthyroidism. Nine of 154 (5.8 %) women who did not meet criteria for an axis-I disorder at baseline met criteria for at least one axis-I disorder during follow-up. Among them, the presence of diabetes mellitus was statistically correlated with a higher probability of developing major depressive disorder at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Although preliminary, our findings are consistent with previous studies and suggest an increased prevalence of MDD and other axis-I disorders among women with newly diagnosed endocrine disorders, providing further evidence suggesting that women with endocrine abnormalities may be at increased risk of depression and/or anxiety disorders.","Fornaro, Michele; Iovieno, Nadia; Clementi, Nicoletta; Boscaro, Marco; Paggi, Francesca; Balercia, Giancarlo; Fava, Maurizio; Papakostas, George I",The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry,62,12

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the correlations for 97 consecutive patients with ALS between clinical parameters and survival following PEG tube placement using the log-rank test and Cox proportional-hazards models. RESULTS The log-rank test showed that an arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2 ) of ≤ 40 mmHg (P = 0.0054), a forced vital capacity (FVC) of ≥ 38% of predicted (P = 0.0003), and bulbar-onset (P = 0.0121) were significantly associated with better post-PEG survival. Multivariate analysis showed that the FVC and PaCO2 were associated with better post-PEG survival (P = 0.0081 and P = 0.0265, respectively).

89814,89814,89814,Results of noninvasive ventilation in very old patients.,19.434599,10.604872,2012,"BACKGROUND Previous studies of epidermal kinetics in psoriasis have relied on invasive biopsy procedures or the use of radioactive labels. We previously developed a non-invasive method for measuring keratin synthesis in human skin using deuterated water labeling, serial collection of tape strips and measurement of deuterium enrichment in protein by mass spectrometry. This powerful method can be applied to measure other skin proteins and lipids collected by tape stripping. Here, for the first time, we apply this technique to investigate the epidermal kinetics of psoriasis, the first step in defining a kinetic profile for normal skin versus activated or quiescent psoriatic skin. METHODS Psoriatic subjects were given (2)H2O orally as twice-daily doses for 16-38 days. Affected and unaffected skin was sampled by tape stripping and washing (modified Pachtman method). Proteins were isolated from the tape strips by a method that enriches for keratin. Turnover times were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Kinetic data were compared to transepidermal water loss (TEWL). RESULTS Deuterium-labeled protein from lesional psoriatic skin appeared at the skin surface within 3-8 days of label administration, whereas labeled protein from non-lesional skin requires 10-20 days to appear. Psoriatic skin had similar rate of growth despite varying anatomic location. Proteins recovered from tape strips were identified by nanoscale liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Isolated peptides were >98% from keratin in uninvolved skin and >72% keratin in psoriatic skin. Revealing that one-quarter of all newly synthesized proteins in psoriatic skin are antimicrobial defense and other immune-related proteins. TEWL values were greater in lesional than non-lesional skin, suggesting barrier compromise in psoriatic skin despite increased clinical thickness. CONCLUSIONS This simple, elegant, and non-invasive method for measuring epidermal protein synthesis, which can also be adapted to measure epidermal lipids, provides a metric that may reveal new insights into the mechanisms and dynamic processes underlying psoriasis and may also provide an objective scale for determining response to therapeutic agents in pre-clinical and clinical trials. This opens a pathway to the non-invasive study of kinetics of protein formation in psoriasis or other skin diseases.","Emson, Claire L; Fitzmaurice, Sarah; Lindwall, Glen; Li, Kelvin W; Hellerstein, Marc K; Maibach, Howard I; Liao, Wilson; Turner, Scott M",Clinical and translational medicine,62,16

Several efforts have been implemented to achieve better outcomes, but an important proportion of patients continue dying. This review focuses on the newest research on prognostic factors and diagnostics, opening new perspectives in the management of CAP. RECENT FINDINGS CAP survival improved in recent years despite an increasing incidence of severe presentations. Appropriateness of antimicrobial choice, combination therapy and early administration of antibiotics has proved to be decisive. Novel biomarkers, as monocyte human leukocyte antigen-DR, presepsin and proadrenomedullin, have been explored for the prediction of severe CAP; moreover, the application of new techniques in metabolomics, genomics and microbiomics in the field of infections may contribute to predicting clinical instability and worse outcomes, showing that precise individual phenotypes are key factors for survival. CAP with unidentified organism is still an issue of concern, but new rapid molecular tests improve yield rates, revealing an unexpected high prevalence of viral detection and proving their usefulness also in the recognition of bacterial causes. SUMMARY Precision medicine applied to risk stratification and diagnosis, together with rapid microbiologic molecular testing, may contribute to optimizing the management of CAP, with potential additional reduction of mortality rates.","Leoni, Davide; Rello, Jordi",Current opinion in infectious diseases,62,1

We evaluated how different nonpharmaceutical interventions could be used to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and reduce the burden on the health care system. METHODS We used an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada. We compared a base case with limited testing, isolation and quarantine to scenarios with the following: enhanced case finding, restrictive physical-distancing measures, or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive physical distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected occupancy of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We present medians and credible intervals from 100 replicates per scenario using a 2-year time horizon. RESULTS We estimated that 56% (95% credible interval 42%-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107 000 (95% credible interval 60 760-149 000) cases in hospital (non-ICU) and 55 500 (95% credible interval 32 700-75 200) cases in ICU. For fixed-duration scenarios, all interventions were projected to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to the base case, with restrictive physical distancing estimated to have the greatest effect. Longer duration interventions were more effective. Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce the proportion of the population infected at the end of the 2-year period and could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontario's ICU capacity. INTERPRETATION Without substantial physical distancing or a combination of moderate physical distancing with enhanced case finding, we project that ICU resources would be overwhelmed. Dynamic physical distancing could maintain health-system capacity and also allow periodic psychological andeconomic respite for populations.","Tuite, Ashleigh R; Fisman, David N; Greer, Amy L",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,62,24

Although in many cases the infection causes very weak symptoms, it can be severe in patient with diverse chronical diseases and immunological compromising patients. Pregnancy is a unique condition in which mother and fetus peacefully collaborate. Diverse endocrine-immune mechanisms, mostly under progesterone control work together to protect the fetus from maternal immunocompetent cell activation driven rejection. The physiological shift to Th2 dominant environment, while favourable for fetus, it makes mothers susceptible to infective pathogens, making pregnancy during COVID-19 pandemic challenging. MATERIALS AND METHODS Studies involving COVID-19 in pregnancy and those analysing changes of immune system induced by COVID-19 were searched in databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect. Databases were searched using a keyword COVID-19/coronavirus, that was combined with following terms: immune system, pregnancy, oestrogen, or progesterone. Search included studies published up to 01.07.2020. Almost 1,500 articles were found, but only 18 met criteria. RESULTS Most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 in mothers infected in the late pregnancy were fever and cough accompanied with lymphopenia and elevated C-reactive protein. Mothers reported to have severe disease had comorbidities and were obese. Low rate of neonatal complications of maternal Sars-Coc-2 infection without neonatal mortality was observed. CONCLUSIONS Currently available data didn't show significant relationship between COVID-19 severity and pregnancy and there is no strong evidence that mother's infection can lead to adverse pregnancy outcome, but further studies are needed to determinate the possible effects of COVID-19 gained during earlier pregnancy.","Gulic, Tamara; Blagojevic Zagorac, Gordana",Hormone molecular biology and clinical investigation,62,30

Here we identify a mechanism that induces CXCR3 expression by AFC and germinal center (GC) B cells. This happens when CD8 T cells are recruited into CD4 T cell-dependent B-cell responses. Ovalbumin-specific CD4 T cells (OTII) were transferred alone or with ovalbumin-specific CD8 T cells (OTI) and the response to subcutaneous alum-precipitated ovalbumin was followed in the draining lymph nodes. OTII cells alone induce T helper 2-associated class switching to IgG1, but few AFC or GC B cells express CXCR3. By contrast, OTI-derived IFN-γ induces most responding GC B cells and AFCs to express high levels of CXCR3, and diverse switching to IgG2a, IgG2b, with some IgG1. Up-regulation of CXCR3 by GC B cells and AFCs and their migration toward its ligand CXCL10 are shown to depend on B cells' intrinsic T-bet, a transcription factor downstream of the IFN-γR signaling. This model clarifies how precursors of long-lived AFCs and memory B cells acquire CXCR3 that causes their migration to inflammatory foci.","Serre, Karine; Cunningham, Adam F; Coughlan, Ruth E; Lino, Andreia C; Rot, Antal; Hub, Elin; Moser, Katrin; Manz, Rudolf; Ferraro, Alastair; Bird, Roger; Toellner, Kai-Michael; Demengeot, Jocelyne; MacLennan, Ian C M; Mohr, Elodie",Blood,62,33

Whereas the role of anti-BP180 antibodies has been extensively characterized, the pathogenicity of anti-BPAG1e antibodies remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the role of antibodies to BPAG1e in the experimental BP models. We generated Bpag1 conditional knockout (Bpag1-cKO) mice, where the KO of Bpag1 is restricted to keratin 5-expressing epithelial cells. Bpag1-cKO mice were immunized with the C-terminal portion of BPAG1e, and the splenocytes were injected into Rag2-/- mice intravenously. The recipient mice presented with erosion on the feet and tails. Microscopic examination showed subepidermal blisters and a linear deposition of IgG at the dermal-epidermal junction. To assess the potential role of trauma on BP development, we inflicted surface wounds on the dorsum of the Rag2-/- recipient mice after adoptive transfer. The wounded Rag2-/- mice had increased morbidity and severity of BP-like symptoms. Moreover, the depletion of B cells from splenocytes abolished a subepidermal blistering phenotype in vivo. These findings demonstrate that antibodies to BPAG1e might play a pathogenic role in causing subepidermal blistering, and external factors, including trauma, might be a trigger for BP development.","Makita, Eiko; Matsuzaki, Yasushi; Fukui, Tomohisa; Matsui, Akinobu; Minakawa, Satoko; Nakano, Hajime; Ito, Koichi; Kijima, Hiroshi; Sawamura, Daisuke",The Journal of investigative dermatology,62,1

Currently, these include 18 ""orphaned sites"" where spent fuel has been left at decommissioned reactor sites. In this context, local communities living close to decommissioned nuclear power plants are increasingly concerned about this legacy of nuclear power production and are seeking alternative strategies to move the spent fuel away from those sites. In this paper, we present a framework and method for the socio-technical multi-criteria evaluation (STMCE) of spent fuel management strategies. The STMCE approach consists of (i) a multi-criteria evaluation that provides an ordinal ranking of alternatives based on a list of criterion measurements; and (ii) a social impact analysis that provides an outranking of options based on the assessment of their impact on concerned social actors. STMCE can handle quantitative, qualitative or both types of information. It can also integrate stochastic uncertainty on criteria measurements and fuzzy uncertainty on assessments of social impacts. We conducted an application of the STMCE method using data from the decommissioned San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) in California. This example intends to facilitate the preparation of stakeholder engagement activities on spent fuel management using the STMCE approach. The STMCE method provides an effective way to compare spent fuel management strategies and support the search for compromise solutions. We conclude by discussing the potential impact that such an approach could have on the management of commercial spent fuel in the United States.","Diaz-Maurin, François; Yu, Jerold; Ewing, Rodney C",The Science of the total environment,62,16

Maternal RV infection during early pregnancy causes the death of the fetus or congenital rubella syndrome in infants. However, the cellular receptor for RV has not yet been identified. In this study, we found that the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) specifically bound to the E1 envelope glycoprotein of RV, and an antibody against MOG could block RV infection. Most importantly, we also showed that ectopic expression of MOG on the cell surface of 293T cells rendered this nonpermissive cell line permissive for RV entry and replication. Thus, this study has identified a cellular receptor for RV and suggests that blocking the MOG attachment site of RV may be a strategy for molecular intervention of RV infection.","Cong, Haolong; Jiang, Yue; Tien, Po",Journal of virology,62,1

This study aims to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on emergency department visits of surgical patients. METHODS The hospital database records of general surgery patients who presented at the emergency department in the period of March 2020-May 2020 (pandemic period) and March 2019-May 2019 (non-pandemic period) were retrospectively analyzed and compared. The primary outcome of this study was the emergency department visit rate of patients requiring a general surgery consultation. Secondary outcomes of this study were patient complaints, diagnosis and treatments, treatment rejection rate, triage category data, the effects of age and gender, and the hospitalization rate. RESULTS In this study, 618 patients were included: 265 patients from the pandemic period and 353 patients from the non-pandemic period. The analysis and comparison revealed that during the pandemic period, the presentation rate of female patients was lower than that of male patients (45.5% vs. 55.5%, respectively, p=0.045). The triage category rates of patient visits to the hospital during the pandemic period were higher in yellow and red, and lower in green (p<0.01). The incidence of a surgical pathology finding was higher during the pandemic period (p=0.019). The incidence of diseases related to the gastrointestinal tract was higher during the pandemic period (p=0.011). The rate of open surgery in the pandemic period was higher than that of the non-pandemic period (80.5% vs. 32.7%, respectively; p<0.01). The treatment rejection rate was also higher in the pandemic period compared with the non-pandemic period (20% vs. 3.7%, respectively; p<0.01, r). In addition, the hospitalization period was shorter in the pandemic period (p=0.021). CONCLUSION A 25% reduction in the number of surgical patient visits to the emergency department was observed during the COVID-19 outbreak. The biggest decrease was seen in patients with a green triage code and female patients. It is significant to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on surgical patients visited the emergency department to manage the post-epidemic period and to prepare for possible future epidemic periods.","Göksoy, Beslen; Akça, Muhammed Tahir; Inanç, Ömer Faruk",Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES,62,1

The objective of this review is to identify and critically appraise the most recent smart devices and wearable technologies used to identify depression, anxiety, and stress, and the physiological process(es) linked to their detection. The MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, and PsycINFO databases were used to identify studies which utilised smart devices and wearable technologies to detect or monitor anxiety, depression, or stress. The included articles that assessed stress and anxiety unanimously used heart rate variability (HRV) parameters for detection of anxiety and stress, with the latter better detected by HRV and electroencephalogram (EGG) together. Electrodermal activity was used in recent studies, with high accuracy for stress detection; however, with questionable reliability. Depression was found to be largely detected using specific EEG signatures; however, devices detecting depression using EEG are not currently available on the market. This systematic review highlights that average heart rate used by many commercially available smart devices is not as accurate in the detection of stress and anxiety compared with heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, and possibly respiratory rate.","Hickey, Blake Anthony; Chalmers, Taryn; Newton, Phillip; Lin, Chin-Teng; Sibbritt, David; McLachlan, Craig S; Clifton-Bligh, Roderick; Morley, John; Lal, Sara",Sensors,62,1

Undergraduate students are often confused by the variability in examination teaching, therefore increasing concerns for upcoming objectively structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). Doctors, despite being expected to teach, rarely receive formal preparation, with only a handful of institutions providing necessary training. The Clinical Orthopaedic Teaching programme for Students (COTS) was designed to equip medical students with the knowledge to perform orthopaedic examinations and to synergistically provide senior students with the necessary experience for the future teaching required of them. METHODS Six fortnightly sessions were delivered, each focusing on a specific joint examination. Student and tutor recruitment were voluntary. Pre-session and post-session multiple-choice questions (MCQs) were provided to students to assess improvement in knowledge. Anonymous feedback forms were provided to both students and tutors. RESULTS From 61 student responses, 98.4% of students stated that COTS met the learning outcomes, with content relevant for their medical curriculum. 96.7% supported COTS' near-peer teaching (NPT) style for OSCE preparation. Based on a five-point Likert scale, students displayed a mean improvement in confidence (1.7±1.2, p<0.001) and MCQ scores (1.3±1.2, p<0.001). All 10 tutors perceived an improvement of their teaching skills and confidence to teach (1.0±0.9, p=0.016). CONCLUSION COTS shows that an NPT style can be used to effectively teach orthopaedic examinations, with benefits for students and tutors. With our aim to refine and upscale this programme, we publish our pilot study findings to encourage similar teaching programmes to be adopted at other universities.","Kumar, Prakrit Raj; Stubley, Thomas; Hashmi, Yousuf; Ahmed, Usman",Postgraduate medical journal,62,1

However, limited research has examined the change in marijuana use among persons living with HIV (PLWH). This study aimed to investigate how marijuana use changed in a cohort of PLWH during the first year of the pandemic and identify factors associated with the change. METHOD 222 PLWH (mean age = 50.2 ± 11.2, 50.9 % female, 14.5 % Hispanic, 64.7 % Black, 15.8 % White, 5 % other, 80.2 % persons using marijuana [at least weekly use], 19.8 % persons not using marijuana) completed a baseline survey on demographics and behavioral/health characteristics between 2018 and 2020 and a brief phone survey between May and October 2020 that assessed changes in marijuana use and overall/mental health, and perceived risks/benefits of marijuana use during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS During the pandemic, 64/222(28.8 %) of the whole sample reported increased marijuana use, 36(16.2 %) reported decreased use, and 122(55 %) reported no change. Multinomial logistic regression results indicated that: Compared to those reporting no change, increased marijuana use during the pandemic was associated with more frequent marijuana use and PTSD symptoms at baseline, worsened mental health during the pandemic, and not perceiving marijuana use as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection. More frequent marijuana use at baseline was the only factor significantly associated with decreased marijuana use during the pandemic. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in marijuana use among a considerable proportion (45 %) of PLWH. Future research is needed to understand the temporality of the increases in marijuana use with worsening mental health.","Wang, Yan; Ibañez, Gladys E; Vaddiparti, Krishna; Stetten, Nichole E; Sajdeya, Ruba; Porges, Eric C; Cohen, Ronald A; Cook, Robert L",Drug and alcohol dependence,62,31

Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA), which can be quantified, for example, through next-generation sequencing, droplet digital PCR and quantitative PCR, is a candidate biomarker with great potential for enabling comprehensive monitoring of allograft injury. dd-cfDNA has a favourable overall diagnostic performance for the detection of rejection and its high negative predictive value might be especially useful for avoiding unnecessary biopsies. Elevated dd-cfDNA levels have been shown to be detectable before graft injury can be clinically identified using current diagnostic methods. Moreover, dd-cfDNA falls rapidly to baseline levels after successful treatment for rejection owing to its short half-life. dd-cfDNA can detect graft injury caused by immune activation owing to insufficient immunosuppression and might therefore also help guide immunosuppression dosing. The fractional abundance of dd-cfDNA can be affected by changes in the recipient cfDNA (for example, due to infection or physical exercise) but the use of absolute quantification of dd-cfDNA overcomes this limitation. Serial dd-cfDNA determinations might therefore facilitate cost-effective personalized clinical management of kidney transplant recipients to reduce premature graft loss.","Oellerich, Michael; Sherwood, Karen; Keown, Paul; Schütz, Ekkehard; Beck, Julia; Stegbauer, Johannes; Rump, Lars Christian; Walson, Philip D",Nature reviews.

However, its ambulatory nature makes the recordings more prone to noise sources. It is important that such noisy segments are identified and removed, since they could have a huge impact on the performance of data-driven decision support tools. In this study, we investigated the added value of machine learning algorithms to separate clean from noisy bio-impedance signals. We compared three approaches: a heuristic algorithm, a feature-based classification model (SVM) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The dataset consists of 47 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients who performed an inspiratory threshold loading protocol. During this protocol, their respiration was recorded with a bio-impedance device and a spirometer, which served as a gold standard. Four annotators scored the signals for the presence of artefacts, based on the reference signal. We have shown that the accuracy of both machine learning approaches (SVM: 87.77 ± 2.64% and CNN: 87.20 ± 2.78%) is significantly higher, compared to the heuristic approach (84.69 ± 2.32%). Moreover, no significant differences could be observed between the two machine learning approaches. The feature-based and neural network model obtained a respective AUC of 92.77±2.95% and 92.51±1.74%. These findings show that a data-driven approach could be beneficial for the task of artefact detection in respiratory thoracic bio-impedance signals.","Moeyersons, Jonathan; Morales, John; Seeuws, Nick; Van Hoof, Chris; Hermeling, Evelien; Groenendaal, Willemijn; Willems, Rik; Van Huffel, Sabine; Varon, Carolina",Sensors,62,30

As formulated here, Black Rage exists in a specific dynamic equilibrium as a compromise formation that is a functional adaptation for oppressed people of color who suffer racial trauma and racial degradation, an adaptation that can be mobilized for the purpose of defense or psychic growth. Black Rage operates as a mental construct in a way analogous to the topographical model, in which mental agencies carry psychic functions. The concept of Black Rage is crucial to constructing a theoretical framework for a psychology of oppression and transgenerational transmission of trauma.

Therefore, the objective was to perform a systematic review of outcomes after synthetic non-absorbable and biologic prosthetics for ventral hernia repair or prophylaxis in contaminated fields. METHODS The systematic literature search identified all articles published up to 2013 that reported outcomes after abdominal wall reinforcement using synthetic non-absorbable or biologic prosthetics in contaminated fields. Studies were included if they included at least 10 cases (excluding inguinal and parastomal hernias). Quality assessment was performed using the MINORS instrument. The main outcomes measures were the incidence of wound infection and hernia at follow-up. Weighted pooled proportions were calculated using a random effects model. RESULTS A total of 32 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included for synthesis. Mean sample size was 41.4 (range 10-190), and duration of follow-up was >1 year in 72 % of studies. Overall quality was low (mean 6.2, range 1-12). Pooled wound infection rates were 31.6 % (95 % CI 14.5-48.7) with biologic and 6.4 % (95 % CI 3.4-9.4) with synthetic non-absorbable prosthetics in clean-contaminated cases, with similar hernia rates. In contaminated and/or dirty fields, wound infection rates were similar, but pooled hernia rates were 27.2 % (95 % CI 9.5-44.9) with biologic and 3.2 % (95 % CI 0.0-11.0) with synthetic non-absorbable. Other outcomes were comparable.

Currently, surgery combined with chemotherapy is the main treatment for osteosarcoma. However, the long-term survival of patients with metastatic osteosarcoma is unsatisfactory. Therefore, new treatment methods to improve the prognosis of patients with osteosarcoma are required. The present study aimed to develop nanocarriers with both tumor targeting and reduction responsiveness abilities, and to improve the therapeutic effect and reduce toxicity by loading traditional small molecule antitumor drugs. The tumor targeting peptide-decorated, doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded mPEG-P(Phe-co-Cys) nanoparticles were developed successfully through the ring-opening polymerization of amino acids. The peptide VATANST (STP) can specifically bind with vimentin, which is highly expressed on the osteosarcoma cell surface, resulting in tumor targeting effects. The nanoparticle is core-shell structured to protect the loaded DOX during blood flow. The disulfide bonds within the nanoparticles are sensitive to the osteosarcoma microenvironment, which has high glutathione (GSH) levels. Under the enhanced permeability and retention and active tumor targeting effects, the STP-decorated DOX-loaded nanoparticles accumulated in tumor tissues. High GSH levels can rupture disulfide bonds, resulting in the controlled release of DOX, which will cause necrosis of tumor cells. The characteristics of the synthesized nanoparticles, DOX release profiles in vitro and in vivo, cytotoxicity analysis, animal study, and safety evaluation were performed. The nanoparticles could increase the tumor inhibition efficiency against osteosarcoma and reduce the side effects of DOX to major organs. The STP-decorated mPEG-P(Phe-co-Cys) nanoparticles might be a suitable drug delivery system for DOX to treat osteosarcoma.","Qiu, Renna; Sun, Denghua; Bai, Yuzhuo; Li, Jiannan; Wang, Lizhe",Drug delivery,62,26

Eleven healthy participants (mean age ± SD: 24 ± 3 years) completed a dynamic knee-extensor exercise in randomized order at three different intensities, eliciting exhaustion after ∼9 min (56 ± 10 W), ∼6 min (60 ± 10 W), and ∼4 min (63 ± 10 W), in addition to a low-intensity (28 ± 5 W) bout. In a novel setup, an electrical doublet stimulation of m. vastus lateralis was applied during exercise (every 30 s) and recovery for frequent evaluation of key contractile properties (maximal force, RFD, RFR, and electromechanical delay) in addition to M-wave characteristics. RFD and RFR remained stable throughout the low-intensity trial but declined in all exhaustive trials to reach a similar level of ∼40% of pre-exercise values at task failure but with the exponential decay augmented by intensity. Following exhaustion, there was a fast initial recovery of RFD and RFR to ∼80% of pre-exercise values within 1 min, followed by a longer suppression at this level. The M-wave characteristics remained unchanged during all trials. In conclusion, this is the first study to quantify the intensity-dependent alterations of RFD and RFR during and after exhaustive dynamic exercise in humans. A hypothesized reduction and fast reversion of RFD was confirmed, and a surprising compromised RFR is reported. The present unique experimental approach allows for novel insight to exercise-induced alterations in human muscle contractile properties which is relevant in health and disease.","Rannou, Fabrice; Nybo, Lars; Andersen, Janni Enghave; Nordsborg, Nikolai B",Frontiers in physiology,62,1

In this study, two new ACR3 genes PvACR3;2 and PvACR3;3 were cloned from P. vittata and studied in model organism yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and model plant tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). Both ACR3s mediated AsIII efflux in yeast, decreasing its As accumulation and enhancing its As tolerance. In addition, PvACR3;2 and PvACR3;3 were expressed in tobacco plant. Localized on the plasma membrane, PvACR3;2 mediated both AsIII translocation to the shoots and AsIII efflux from the roots in tobacco, resulting in 203 - 258% increase in shoot As after exposing to 5 μM AsIII under hydroponics. In comparison, localized to the vacuolar membrane, PvACR3;3 sequestrated AsIII in tobacco root vacuoles, leading to 18 - 20% higher As in the roots and 15 - 36% lower As in the shoots. Further, based on qRT-PCR, both genes were mainly expressed in P. vittata fronds, indicating PvACR3;2 and PvACR3;3 may play roles in AsIII translocation and sequestration in the fronds. This study provides not only new insights into the functions of new ACR3 genes in P. vittata, but also important gene resources for manipulating As accumulation in plants for phytoremediation and food safety.","Chen, Jun-Xiu; Cao, Yue; Yan, Xiangjuan; Chen, Yanshan; Ma, Lena Q",Journal of hazardous materials,62,1

Clinicians are faced with the difficult task of managing patients with PIPH while maintaining the efficacy of antifungal therapy. Commonly, modifications to posaconazole therapy are utilized in managing PIPH, including dosage reduction of posaconazole or switch to an alternative antifungal. OBJECTIVES To characterize the management of patients diagnosed with PIPH and their response to various therapeutic interventions. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 20 consecutive adult patients diagnosed with PIPH. Patient data collected included blood pressure, electrolytes, endocrine laboratory values and posaconazole serum concentrations collected before and after therapeutic intervention. RESULTS Of 20 patients included, 17 patients (85%) underwent therapeutic modification, with posaconazole dose reduction (n = 11) as the most common change. Other modifications included discontinuation (n = 3), switch to an alternative antifungal (n = 2) and addition of spironolactone (n = 1). Clinical improvement (decrease in systolic blood pressure and increase in serum potassium) was observed in 9 of 17 patients (52.9%). An average decrease in systolic blood pressure of 7.1 mmHg and increase in serum potassium of 0.22 mmol/L was observed following therapeutic modification. CONCLUSIONS We report our experience with PIPH management, for which there is no universally effective strategy. We utilized a stepwise approach for management, starting with posaconazole dose reduction and repeat assessment of clinical and laboratory parameters. If resolution of PIPH is not achieved, an alternative triazole antifungal or the addition of an aldosterone antagonist are additional potential interventions. It is possible for PIPH to persist after therapeutic modification despite these interventions. Thus, early diagnosis and continuous monitoring is warranted.","Davis, Matthew R; Nguyen, Minh-Vu H; Gintjee, Thomas J; Odermatt, Alex; Young, Brian Y; Thompson, George R",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,62,4

Moreover, the addition of ECM-like proteins could enhance the biocompatibility of these scaffolds. In this study, soluble eggshell protein (SEP) was first extracted and synthesized from the raw eggshell membrane. The characteristics and biocompatibility of the extracted SEP were evaluated using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) analysis and 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay. For scaffolds fabrication, a three-layer nanofibrous composite structure was produced using the electrospinning technique. The outer layers composed of polyvinyl alcohol, chitosan, and extracted SEP while the middle layer composed of polyethylene oxide, gelatin, and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs). For each layer, the electrospinning parameters were adjusted to form bead-free fibers. To improve fibers' stability against body fluids, the produced fibers were crosslinked using glutaraldehyde vapor. Several techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray, ATR-FTIR, swelling, tensile test, in vitro biodegradation, and MTT assay were implemented to evaluate the physical, chemical, and biological characterization of the fabricated fibers. The results showed that crosslinked fibers have adequate stability in water, suitable mechanical properties, and promising water uptake capacity. The MTT results also revealed that SEP and ZnO-NPs could increase scaffolds biocompatibility. Moreover, SEM photographs of cultured fibroblasts cells on the scaffolds showed that cells were well attached on the scaffolds and preserve their natural spindle shapes. Altogether, our findings demonstrated that the produced three-layer composite scaffolds are potential candidates for skin tissue engineering.","Amirsadeghi, Armin; Khorram, Mohammad; Hashemi, Seyeddeh-Sara",Journal of biomedical materials research.

METHODS A double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial was conducted to compare warm, humidified CO2 and cold-dry CO2. Patients with benign uterine diseases were randomized to either treatment (n = 48) or control (n = 49) group during laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy. Primary endpoints of the study were rest pain, movement pain, shoulder-tip pain, and cough pain at 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively, measured by visual analogue scale. Secondary outcomes were morphine consumption, rejected boli, temperature change, recovery room stay, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS There were no significant differences in all baseline characteristics. Shoulder-tip pain at 6 h postoperatively was significantly reduced in the intervention group. Pain at rest, movement pain, and cough pain did not differ. Total morphine consumption and rejected boli at 24 h postoperatively were significantly higher in the control group. Temperature change, recovery room stay, and length of hospital were similar. CONCLUSIONS Warm, humidified insufflation gas significantly reduces postoperative shoulder-tip pain as well as morphine demand.

DESIGN Systematic review of diagnostic studies. DATA SOURCES Medline/Pubmed, Embase/Ovid, CINAHL/EBSCO and Google Scholar up to October 2018. STUDY SELECTION Studies that assessed CDRs for intermittent-type chest pain and for rule out of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) applicable in general practice, thus not relying on advanced laboratory, computer or diagnostic testing. REVIEW METHODS Reviewers identified studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of the evidence (using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2)), independently and in duplicate. RESULTS Eight studies comprising five CDRs met the inclusion criteria. Three CDRs are designed for rule out of coronary disease in intermittent-type chest pain (Gencer rule, Marburg Heart Score, INTERCHEST), and two for rule out of ACS (Grijseels rule, Bruins Slot rule). Studies that examined the Marburg Heart Score had the highest methodological quality with consistent sensitivity (86%-91%), specificity (61%-81%) and positive (23%-35%) and negative (97%-98%) predictive values (PPV and NPV). The diagnostic performance of Gencer (PPV: 20%-34%, NPV: 95%-99%) and INTERCHEST (PPV: 35%-43%, NPV: 96%-98%) appear comparable, but requires further validation. The Marburg Heart Score was more sensitive in detecting coronary disease than the clinical judgement of the general practitioner. The performance of CDRs that focused on rule out of ACS were: Grijseels rule (sensitivity: 91%, specificity: 37%, PPV: 57%, NPV: 82%) and Bruins Slot (sensitivity: 97%, specificity: 10%, PPV: 23%, NPV: 92%). Compared with clinical judgement, the Bruins Slot rule appeared to be safer than clinical judgement alone, but the study was limited in sample size. CONCLUSIONS In general practice, there is currently no clinical decision aid that can safely rule out ACS. For intermittent chest pain, several rules exist, of which the Marburg Heart Score has been most extensively tested and appears to outperform clinical judgement alone.","Harskamp, Ralf E; Laeven, Simone C; Himmelreich, Jelle Cl; Lucassen, Wim A M; van Weert, Henk C P M",BMJ open,62,1

We report on the association between variations in stroke severity, patient outcomes, cost, and treatment patterns observed over the acute hospital stay and through the 12-month follow-up for subjects receiving endovascular therapy compared to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator alone in the IMS (Interventional Management of Stroke) III Trial. METHODS AND RESULTS Prospective data collected for a prespecified economic analysis of the trial were used. Data included hospital billing records for the initial stroke admission and subsequent detailed resource use after the acute hospitalization collected at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Cost of follow-up care varied 6-fold for patients in the lowest (0-1) and highest (20+) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale category at 5 days, and by modified Rankin Scale at 3 months. The kind of resources used postdischarge also varied between treatment groups. Incremental short-term cost-effectiveness ratios varied greatly when treatments were compared for patient subgroups. Patient subgroups predefined by stroke severity had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $97 303/quality-adjusted life year (severe stroke) and $3 187 805/quality-adjusted life year (moderately severe stroke). CONCLUSIONS Detailed economic and resource utilization data from IMS III provide powerful evidence for the large effect that patient outcome has on the economic value of medical and endovascular reperfusion therapies. These data can be used to inform process improvements for stroke care and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of endovascular therapy in the US health system for stroke intervention trials.

METHODS A randomized controlled split-mouth and blind trial was carried out. Patients (n = 38) with at least two NCCL were included. Beforehand the cervical restoration placement, the NCCL (181 teeth) were randomly allocated into two treatment groups according to the tooth isolation techniques: cotton roll or rubber dam. Experienced, trained, blinded, and calibrated examiners performed periodontal evaluations at baseline and 5-year follow-up, using a periodontal probe. Restorations were assessed with the FDI criteria. Thirty-two patients (154 teeth) were evaluated at 5-year. The occurrence/progression of GR between baseline and follow-up was considered the primary outcome. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated by Poisson regression (α < 0.05). RESULTS After 5-year, 31 teeth (13.6%) presented occurrence/progression of GR. In the multivariate analyses, occurrence/progression of GR was associated with the use of rubber dam isolation (RR; 95%CI: 2.65; 1.01 - 7.00) and lack of marginal adaptation of the restoration (RR; 95%CI: 10.98; 2.31 - 52.30). Toothbrush stiffness, use of abrasive dentifrice, tooth type, presence of biofilm and presence of gingivitis did not present statistically significant higher risk for occurrence/progression of GR. CONCLUSION The use of rubber dam isolation associated with retraction clamp and the lack of a proper marginal adaptation of the composite restorations are risk indicators for the occurrence/progression of GR in individuals that received a restoration for NCCL. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Isolation with rubber dam and dental clamps may promote GR in sites with restored NCCL. Moreover, clinical examinations for lack of marginal adaptations of the restorations may be included in a clinical setting.","Favetti, Morgana; Montagner, Anelise Fernandes; Fontes, Silvia Terra; Martins, Thiago Marchi; Masotti, Alexandre Severo; Dos Santos Jardim, Patricia; Corrêa, Fernanda Oliveira Bello; Cenci, Maximiliano Sergio; Muniz, Francisco Wilker Mustafa Gomes",Journal of dentistry,62,30

Although the overlap method is a safe and feasible approach for esophagojejunostomy, it has several technical limitations. We developed novel modifications for the overlap method to overcome these disadvantages. METHODS Forty-eight consecutive gastric cancer patients underwent totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy or laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with double-tract reconstruction at our institution from January 2019 to April 2020 using the overlap method with the following modifications. The esophagus was initially rotated by 90° counterclockwise, followed by transection of two-thirds of the esophageal diameter. The unstapled esophagus was then transected with a harmonic ultrasonic scalpel to enable esophagostomy at the posterior side of the esophagus. A side-to-side esophagojejunostomy was then formed at the posterior side of the esophagus using an endoscopic linear stapler through the right lower trocar. The common entry hole was closed via hand sewing method using V-Loc suture. This procedure was termed ""esophagus two-step-cut overlap method."" RESULTS Only one patient suffered from esophagojejunal anastomotic leakage but subsequently recovered after conservative treatment. Patients did not experience anastomotic bleeding or stricture. CONCLUSION Our modified overlap method provides satisfactory surgical outcomes and overcomes several technical limitations, such as entering the false lumen of the esophagus, unnecessary pollution caused by nasogastric tube, and unintended left crus stapling during anastomosis.","Sun, Ke-Kang; Wang, Zhen; Peng, Wei; Cheng, Ming; Huang, Yi-Kai; Yang, Jia-Bin; Chen, Zheng-Rong; Ren, Rui; Zhu, Bao-Song; Gong, Wei; Su, Wen-Zhao; Liu, Tian-Hua; Zhao, Kui; Chen, Qiang; Wu, Yong-You",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,62,30

METHODS This article presents a retrospective description of a case series including five NBCA injections through a dual lumen balloon performed by a single operator in three patients with BAVM. Demographic, clinical, imaging and procedure-related data are reported. RESULTS The three patients presented with ruptured BAVMs. Of the patients, one underwent proximal flow-related ruptured aneurysm coiling before planned BAVM embolization. In the three patients, staged BAVM embolization as a first line treatment was decided. Preliminary embolization of high-flow BAVM fistulas by NBCA using a dual lumen balloon under local flow-arrest conditions was performed and five separate injections were carried out without any complications. No balloon entrapment or rupture was observed.

However, little is known about the public willingness to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine in China. This study aimed to understand the willingness and determinants for the acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine among Chinese adults. Methods: A cross-sectional survey using an online questionnaire was conducted in an adult population in China. Chi-square tests were used to identify differences for various intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccination. The t test was used to identify differences among vaccine hesitancy scores. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the predicated factors associated with the willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Of the 3195 eligible participants, 83.8% were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and 76.6% believed the vaccine would be beneficial to their health; however, 74.9% expressed concerns or a neutral attitude regarding its potential adverse effects. Of the participants, 76.5% preferred domestically manufactured vaccines and were more willing to be vaccinated than those who preferred imported vaccines. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that lack of confidence, complacency in regard to health, risk of the vaccine, and attention frequency were the main factors affecting the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: Our study indicated that the respondents in China had a high willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, but some participants also worried about its adverse effects. Information regarding the efficacy and safety of an upcoming COVID-19 vaccine should be disseminated to ensure its acceptance and coverage.","Chen, Musha; Li, Yanjun; Chen, Jiaoshan; Wen, Ziyu; Feng, Fengling; Zou, Huachun; Fu, Chuanxi; Chen, Ling; Shu, Yuelong; Sun, Caijun",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,62,0

The authors set out to determine whether duration of a triple low state and aggregate risk associated with individual diagnostic and procedure codes are independently associated with perioperative and intermediate-term mortality. METHODS The authors studied 16,263 patients (53 ± 16 yr) who underwent noncardiac surgery at Duke University Medical Center between January 2006 and December 2009. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to determine whether perioperative factors were independently associated with perioperative and intermediate-term all-cause mortality. RESULTS The 30-day mortality rate was 0.8%. There were statistically significant associations between 30-day mortality and various perioperative risk factors including age, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status, emergency surgery, higher Cleveland Clinic Risk Index score, and year of surgery. Cumulative duration of triple low state was not associated with 30-day mortality (multivariable odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.07). The clinical risk factors for 30-day mortality remained predictors of intermediate-term mortality, whereas cumulative duration of triple low was not associated with intermediate-term mortality (multivariable hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.01).

The aim of this study was to compare pain after transumbilical single-port laparoscopic appendectomy (SA) with pain after conventional three-port laparoscopic appendectomy (TA). METHODS From April to September 2011, 50 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for simple appendicitis without gangrene or perforation. Patients who had undergone appendectomy with a drainage procedure were excluded. The type of surgery was chosen based on patient preference after written informed consent was obtained. The primary endpoint was postoperative pain evaluated by the visual analogue scale score and postoperative analgesic use. Operative time, recovery of bowel function, and length of hospital stay were secondary outcome measures. RESULTS SA using a SILS port (Covidien) was performed in 17 patients. The other 33 patients underwent TA. Pain scores in the 24 hours after surgery were higher in patients who underwent SA (P = 0.009). The change in postoperative pain score over time was significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.021). SA patients received more total doses of analgesics (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) in the 24 hours following surgery, but the difference was not statistically significant. The median operative time was longer for SA (P < 0.001).

Alveolar fluid clearance is required for recovery and effective gas exchange, and higher rates of AFC are associated with reduced mortality. Thyroid hormones play multiple roles in lung function, and L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) has multiple effects on lung AT2 cells. T3 enhances AFC in normal adult rat lungs when administered intramuscularly and in normal or hypoxia-injured lungs when given intratracheally. The safety of a commercially available formulation of liothyronine sodium (synthetic T3) administered intratracheally was assessed in an IND-enabling toxicology study in healthy rats. Instillation of the commercial formulation of T3 without modification rapidly caused tracheal injury and often mortality. Intratracheal instillation of T3 that was reformulated and brought to a neutral pH at the maximum feasible dose of 2.73 µg T3 in 300 µL for five consecutive days had no clinically relevant T3-related adverse clinical, histopathologic or clinical pathology findings. There were no unscheduled deaths that could be attributed to the reformulated T3 or control articles, no differences in the lung weights, and no macroscopic or microscopic findings considered to be related to treatment with T3. This preclinical safety study has paved the way for a phase I/II study to determine the safety and tolerability of a T3 formulation delivered into the lungs of ARDS patients, including COVID-19-asssociated ARDS, and to measure the effect on extra-vascular lung water in these patients Significance Statement There is growing interest in treating lung disease with thyroid hormone (T3) in pulmonary edema and ARDS. However, there is not any published experience on the impact of direct administration of T3 into the lung. An essential step is to determine the and safety of multiple doses of T3 administered in a relevant animal species.

When combating viral infections, T lymphocytes are an indispensable part of human acquired immunity. However, studies on the use of natural products in stimulating lymphocyte-mediated interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production are very limited. In this study, we found that acteoside, a natural phenylpropanoid glycoside from Kuding Tea, enhanced IFN-γ production in mouse lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, particularly in the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets of T lymphocytes. To this end, we suggest that the antiviral activity of acteoside was highly correlated to its inducing ability of IFN-γ production. Mechanistically, the activation of T-bet enhanced the promoter of IFN-γ and subsequently resulted in an increased IFN-γ production in T cells. Collectively, we have found a natural product with the capacity to selectively enhance mouse T cell IFN-γ production. Given the role of IFN-γ in the immune system, further studies to clarify the role of acteoside in inducing IFN-γ and prevention of viral infection are needed.","Song, Xun; He, Jiang; Xu, Hong; Hu, Xiao-Peng; Wu, Xu-Li; Wu, Hai-Qiang; Liu, Li-Zhong; Liao, Cheng-Hui; Zeng, Yong; Li, Yan; Hao, Yue; Xu, Chen-Shu; Fan, Long; Zhang, Jian; Zhang, Hong-Jie; He, Zhen-Dan",Food & function,62,1

Here, we report on the geometric and electronic features of C60evaporated on a single layer of hexagonal-boron nitride (h-BN) grown on the Rh(110) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). Two different molecular assemblies of C60on the h-BN/Rh(110) surface were observed. The first STM combined study at room temperature (RT) and at low temperatures (40 K) of the molecular orientation of C60on a 2D layered material is presented. Intramolecular resolution images have allowed to demonstrate the existence of a phase transition of C60over the h-BN/Rh(110) surface similar to that found on bulk solid C60. At RT molecules exhibit random orientations, while at 40 K such rotational disorder vanishes and they adopt a common orientation over the h-BN/Rh(110) surface. The decrease of the thermal energy allows the recognition between C60molecules, which makes them to become equally oriented in the configuration at which the van der Waals intermolecular interactions are optimized. Bias dependent submolecular features obtained by means of high resolution STM images have been interpreted as the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO). Besides, STS data evidenced that fullerenes are electronically decoupled from the substrate, with a negligible charge transfer effect if any. Finally, the very early stages of multilayer growth were also investigated.","Guo, Haojie; Martínez-Galera, Antonio Javier; Gomez-Rodriguez, Jose M",Nanotechnology,62,12

METHODS The TIAregistry.org enrolled 4789 patients (1149 Asians and 3640 non-Asians) with a TIA or minor ischemic stroke within 7 days of onset. Every participating facility had systems dedicated to urgent intervention of TIA/stroke patients by specialists. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, and nonfatal acute coronary syndrome. RESULTS Approximately 80% of patients were evaluated within 24 hours of symptom onset. At 1 year, there were no differences in the rates of composite cardiovascular events (6.8% versus 6.0%; P=0.38) and stroke (6.0% versus 4.8%; P=0.11) between Asians and non-Asians. Asians had a lower risk of cerebrovascular disease (stroke or TIA) than non-Asians (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.98; P=0.03); the difference was primarily driven by a lower rate of TIA in Asians (4.2% versus 8.3%; P<0.001). Moderately severe bleeding was more frequent in Asians (0.8% versus 0.3%; P=0.02). In multivariable analysis, multiple acute infarcts (P=0.005) and alcohol consumption (P=0.02) were independent predictors of stroke recurrence in Asians, whereas intracranial stenosis (P<0.001), ABCD2 score (P<0.001), atrial fibrillation (P=0.008), extracranial stenosis (P=0.03), and previous stroke or TIA (P=0.03) were independent predictors in non-Asians. CONCLUSIONS The short-term stroke risk after a TIA or minor stroke was lower than expected when urgent evidence-based care was delivered, irrespective of race/ethnicity or region.

Here, using a lineage-tracking system, we show that some cells, primarily oligodendrocytes (OLs) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), survive the acute MHV infection, are associated with regions of demyelination, and persist in the central nervous system (CNS) for at least 150 d. These surviving OLs express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and other genes associated with an inflammatory response. Notably, the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration was variable, dependent on anatomic location within the CNS, and without obvious correlation with numbers of surviving cells. We detected more demyelination in regions with larger numbers of T cells and microglia/macrophages compared to those with fewer infiltrating cells. Conversely, in regions with less inflammation, these previously infected OLs more rapidly extended processes, consistent with normal myelinating function. Together, these results show that OLs are inducers as well as targets of the host immune response and demonstrate how a CNS infection, even after resolution, can induce prolonged inflammatory changes with CNS region-dependent impairment in remyelination.","Pan, Ruangang; Zhang, Qinran; Anthony, Scott M; Zhou, Yu; Zou, Xiufen; Cassell, Martin; Perlman, Stanley",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,62,16

Proper modeling of forces is important to optimize process accuracy and productivity, including characterizing stability of micromachining process. Although the precision of mechanistic models depends on the uncertainty of the force coefficients, these models are deterministic and do not take into account the uncertainty in the model parameters. Bayesian inference provides a formal framework to incorporate uncertainty into the model formulation. In this study, the posterior probabilities in each Bayesian update are estimated using a numerical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme, known as Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm. To determine the starting point of Markov Chain, two different calibration approaches are first used to obtain the deterministic coefficients of the mechanistic model: genetic algorithm (GA) and nonlinear regression. The uncertainties in these coefficients are then evaluated using the Bayesian inference approach. For both of the cases, a uniform prior distribution is used. Finally, the uncertainty in coefficients is propagated into predicted micromilling forces to obtain the uncertainties in predicted forces. It is concluded that the presented approach is successful in uncertainty quantification of the force model coefficients for polymer micromilling and assessing their effect on forces with different calibration approaches.","Shekhar, Shivang; Ozutemiz, Kadri Bugra; Onler, Recep; Nahata, Sudhanshu; Ozdoganlar, O.

The purpose of this research is to present a classification model that identifies delirium using retrospective EHR data. The classification model would support the additional identification of delirium cases otherwise undocumented during routine practice. Methods Delirium was confirmed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). Age, sex, Elixhauser comorbidity index, drug exposures, and diagnoses were used as features to train the logistic regression and multi-layer perceptron models. The clinical notes from the EHR were parsed to supplement the features that were not recorded in the structured data. The model performance was evaluated with a 5-fold cross-validation area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results Seventy-six patients (17 cases and 59 controls) with at least one CAM-ICU evaluation result during ICU stay from January 30, 2018 to February 20, 2018 were included in the model. The multi-layer perceptron model achieved the best performance in identifying delirium; mean AUC of 0.967 {+/-} 0.019. The mean positive predictive value (PPV), mean negative predicted value (NPV), mean sensitivity, and mean specificity of the MLP model were 0.9, 0.88, 0.56, and 0.95, respectively. Conclusion A simple classification model showed a mean AUC over 0.95. This model promises to identify delirium cases with EHR data, thereby enable a sustainable infrastructure to build a retrospective cohort of delirium in the ICU. The cohort would be useful for the evaluation of long-term sequelae of delirium in ICU.","Kim, J. H.; Hua, M.; Whittington, R. A.; Lee, J.; Liu, C.; Ta, C. N.; Marcantonio, E. R.; Goldberg, T.

Although official lockdowns were typically short-term and allowed people to leave their homes for exercise and essential activities, some individuals did not leave their home for prolonged periods due to a range of factors including clinical vulnerability. This study aimed to explore longitudinal patterns of such 'home confinement' across different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, and its associated predictors and mental health outcomes. Methods: Data were from the UCL COVID -19 Social Study. The analytical sample consisted of 25,390 adults in England who were followed up for 17 months from March 2020 to July 2021. Data were analysed using growth mixture models. Results: Our analyses identified three classes of growth trajectories, including one class showing a high level of persistent home confinement (24.8%), one changing class with clear alignment with national containment policy/advice (32.0%), and one class with a persistently low level of confinement (43.1%). A range of factors were found to be associated the class membership of home confinement trajectories, such as age, gender, income, employment status, social relationships and health. The class with a high level of confinement had the highest number of depressive and anxiety symptoms at the end of the follow-up independent of potential confounders. Conclusions: There was substantial heterogeneity in longitudinal patterns of home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a striking proportion of our sample maintained a high level of home confinement over the course of 17 months, even during periods when containment measures were eased or removed and when infection rates were low. They also had the worst mental health outcomes. This group warrants special attention in addressing the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bu, F.; Steptoe, A.; Fancourt, D.",,62,1

Methods: This is a narrative review articles and we use triangulation method to collect the related information from multiple electronic database. The results and findings of the selected articles were summarized and synthesized. Results: As the number of COVID-19 infected people grows and the uncertainty of finding a cure continues, the people are becoming more apprehensive. Pharmaceutical companies made changes to their marketing strategies. From being too invested with in-person marketing, most companies are now exploring options that do not require as much physical interaction. Pharmaceutical companies have been reliant on telemarketing, digital marketing, and miscellaneous offers. This change is primarily driven by fear of being infected by the virus and self-preservation.

Aging is a tuberculosis comorbidity. Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) are used to detect latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection (LTBI) in adults, but their performance in the elderly is not well established. We aim to evaluate the performance of IGRAs for LTBI detection in healthy elderly Hispanics with recent, remote or no history of M.tb exposure. Study Design and Methods. Cross sectional study in Hispanic elderly (60+y) and adult (18-50y) recent TB contacts (ReC) or community controls (CoC). LTBI was based on a positive T-SPOT.TB and/or QuantiFERON-Gold in-tube or Plus assay. Results. We enrolled 193 CoC (119 adults/74 elderly) and 459 ReC (361 adults/98 elderly). LTBI positivity increased with age in CoC (range 19-59%; trend p <0.001), but was similar in ReC (range 59-69%; trend p=0.329). The elderly had lower concordance between IGRAs (kappa 0.465 vs. 0.688 in adults) and more inconclusive results (indeterminate/borderline; 11.6% vs. 5.8% in adults; p=0.012). Exclusion of inconclusive results improved concordance between assays, notably in elderly ReC, who have the highest TB risk (from kappa 0.532 to 0.800). When both IGRAs were done simultaneously, inconclusive results were resolved in all cases as positive or negative with the other IGRA. The magnitude of the response to M.tb peptides used in the assays was similar between age groups, but responsiveness to mitogens was lower in the elderly. Conclusions. IGRAs are suitable for LTBI detection in the elderly. Discordant and inconclusive findings are more prevalent in the elderly, but results were resolved when performing different IGRAs simultaneously in the same participant.","Scordo, J.

In response to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, it has been shown that the generation of antigen-specific CD4(+) T-cell immunity is impaired in old mice. In contrast, recent findings document that old mice display a transient enhanced resistance that occurs within the first 3 weeks of infection. Early resistance was associated with the presence of CD8(+) T cells and their ability to produce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) well before their young counterparts.

In urban areas, the employment-based healthcare-insurance schemes (Government Insurance Scheme and Labour Insurance Scheme) worked hand in hand with the full employment policy of the Government, which guaranteed basic care for almost every urban resident. However, since the economic reforms of the early 1980s, China's healthcare system has met great challenges. Some came from the reform of the labour system, and other challenges came from the introduction of market forces in the healthcare sector. The new policy of the Chinese Government on the Urban Employees' Basic Health Care Insurance is to introduce a cost-sharing plan in urban China. Like other major social policy changes, this new health policy also has a great impact on the lives of the Chinese people. Affordability has been the major concern among urban residents. Shanghai implemented the cost-sharing healthcare policy in the spring of 2001. It may be too early to assess the pros and cons of the new policy, but evidence shows that the employment-based health-insurance scheme excludes those at high risk and in most need. It is argued that the cost-sharing healthcare system will limit access by some people, especially those who are most vulnerable to the consequences of ill health and those in low-income groups, unless the deductibles vary according to income and unless low-income groups are exempt from paying premiums and deductibles.","Dong, Weizhen","Journal of health, population, and nutrition",62,33

In recent years, various prevention strategies and lines of research have been launched that focus on this complexity, making suicidality easier to treat and understand. The 113 foundation for suicide prevention has an important coordinating and facilitating role in this.","de Winter, Remco; de Beurs, Derek",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,62,16

With advances in treatment options, the identification of patients with obstructive ETD is becoming increasingly important. The objective of this study was to validate a Danish translation of the 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7). METHODS All participants underwent tympanometry, otomicroscopy and completed the ETDQ-7. We included 34 ears from patients with obstructive ETD who had abnormal tympanometry curves but no history of cholesteatoma or adhesive otitis. As a control group, 48 otherwise healthy ears with a normal tympanometry curve were included from patients with known sensorineural hearing loss or normal hearing. RESULTS A Cronbach's alpha of 0.77 indicated a good internal consistency reliability of the questionnaire. The mean ETDQ-7 score in the obstructive ETD group was 31 versus 13.5 in the control group (p = 0.00). A receiver operating characteristics analysis produced an area under the curve of 94%, showing excellent discriminatory abilities between the groups. CONCLUSIONS The ETDQ-7 has previously been validated in English, German, Dutch and Portuguese, demonstrating good clinical relevance. The Danish translation of the ETDQ-7 has produced similar results and may be valuable in diagnosing obstructive ETD and in monitoring the effect of balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube.

The aim of this study was to describe the impact of these measures on the number of hospitalizations in Cardiovascular Intensive Care Units, with the hypothesis that the social behavior generated by this emergency promotes a decreased demand for medical care, even when severe cardiovascular disease is involved. We compared the number of admissions in March-April 2010-2019 versus March-April 2020, based on a prospective study including six institutions (three public and three private) that use Epi-Cardio® as a multicenter registry of cardiovascular care unit discharge. Altogether, we included 6839 patients discharged during the 11-year study period (2010-2020). The average number of patient admissions on March-April 2010-19 was 595 (CI 95%: 507-683) and decreased to 348 in 2020 (fall of 46.8%, p < 0.001). The reasons for hospitalization were classified into 11 groups and a statistically significant reduction was seen in 10 of these groups: cardiovascular surgery 72.3%, electrophysiological interventions 67.8%, non-ST acute coronary syndromes 52.6%, angioplasties 47.6%, arrhythmias 48.7%, heart failure 46%, atrial fibrillation 35.7%, ST elevation myocardial infarction 34.7%, non cardiac chest pain 31.8%, others 51.6%. Although with low prevalence, hypertensive crisis increased in 89%. The abrupt decrease observed in the number of admissions due to critical pathologies may be considered an ""adverse effect"" related to the measures adopted, with potentially severe consequences. This trend could be reversed by improving public communication and policy adjustment.","Vensentini, Natalia; Zaidel, Ezequiel J; Charask, Adrián; Salzberg, Simón; Gagliardi, Juan; Perea, Joaquín; Sosa Liprandi, Álvaro; de Abreu, Maximiliano; Mariani, Javier; Tajer, Carlos D",Medicina,62,19

Neutrophils are also more numerous in cytograms of allergic persons. Topical intranasal corticosteroid therapy for allergic rhinitis has been shown to decrease the numbers of some inflammatory cell types. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray, a potent synthetic corticosteroid preparation, is effective therapy for seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis. METHODS Nasal mucosal scrapings were obtained with a Rhinoprobe (Apotex Scientific, Inc. Arlington, Texas) before and after therapy with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray at several doses in patients with either seasonal allergic rhinitis (2 to 4 weeks' therapy) or perennial allergic rhinitis (24 weeks' therapy). More than 1000 paired nasal cytograms obtained from patients participating in five multicenter studies were evaluated. RESULTS The percentage of patients with nasal eosinophils (p < 0.01, most studies) and basophilic cells (p < 0.05, most studies) decreased significantly after treatment with fluticasone propionate compared with placebo-treated patients. Similar findings were observed with beclomethasone dipropionate in one study. The number of neutrophils remained relatively unchanged after treatment with the intranasal corticosteroids or placebo. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that the therapeutic benefits of topical intranasal fluticasone propionate and beclomethasone dipropionate for the therapy of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis are reflected by the decrease in inflammatory cells in the nasal mucosa.","Meltzer, E O; Orgel, H A; Rogenes, P R; Field, E A",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,62,12

Due to the time dynamic of antibodies, the antibody concentration of the same patient varies greatly at different times during the course of the disease. Therefore, our study used IgM/T or IgG/T (the ratio of serum antibody concentration to days after symptom onset) to reflect the patient's humoral immune status, and analyzed their correlation with COVID-19 development and outcome. METHODS Clinical data of 50 non-critical COVID-19 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Time-resolved fluorescence immunochromatography was used to quantitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG. Correlation analysis was performed. RESULTS IgM antibody was positive on day 5 of symptom onset, increased within 2 weeks, and then gradually decreased. However, IgG antibody was positive on week 2 of symptom onset and continued to increase since. Additionally, IgM/T, but not IgG/T of recovery period (Spearman ρ=0.17; P=0.283), was negatively correlated with disease course in 2 weeks of symptom onset (Spearman ρ=-0.860; P=0.000). IgG/T of recovery period was positively correlated with clinical classification (Spearman ρ=0.432; P=0.004), number of involved lung lobes (Spearman ρ=0.343; P=0.026), and lung lesions (Spearman ρ=0.472; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS Within 2 weeks of symptom onset, higher IgM/T indicates faster recovery and shorter disease course. In recovery period, higher IgG/T suggests more serious disease. IgM/T or IgG/T may predict disease severity and outcome in non-critical COVID-19 patients.","Rong, Yan; Wang, Fei; Li, Xiaoli; Liang, Xinhua; Zhou, Yang; Zhang, Dandan; Liu, Jing; Zeng, Huadong; Wang, Jing; Shi, Yi",American journal of translational research,62,31

The purpose of the present study was to cross-validate temporal, two tympanic devices, and oral devices compared to an ingestible thermistor during exercise in a hot, humid environment. Fourteen young, active adults (6 women) completed a graded exercise test until voluntary exhaustion in an environmental chamber (35.5 ± 0.6 °C, 53.9 ± 5.8 % RH). There was no statistical difference in mean temperature between tympanic device 1 and pill-based core temperature (PBTc) measurements across all time points and were positively correlated (0.357; P<0.001). Temperatures of tympanic device 2 were statistically higher than PBTc (37.8 ± 0.7 ºC vs. 37.6 ± 1.0 ºC; respectfully) (P=0.008). At all time points, temperatures for the second tympanic device and PBTc were positively correlated (0.192; P=0.043). Temporal and PBTc values did not differ across time points and were positively correlated (0.262; P=0.005) across all time points. Mean oral temperature was significantly less than mean PBTc across all time points. (37.0 ± 0.4 ºC vs. 37.6 ± 1.0 ºC, respectively) (P<0.001). Across all time points, oral and PBTc were positively correlated (0.262; P=0.010). Tympanic and temporal devices can reflect Tc while exercising in a hot, humid environment.

Chronic disease care has also changed for many patients, with uncertain downstream consequences. METHODS: We included participants with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions followed by specialists at Johns Hopkins. Participants completed periodic surveys querying comorbidities, disease-modifying medications, exposures, COVID-19 testing and outcomes, social behaviors, and disruptions to healthcare. We assessed whether COVID-19 risk is higher among those on immunomodulating or suppressive agents and characterized pandemic-associated changes to care and mental health. RESULTS: 265 (5.6%) developed COVID-19 over 9 months of follow-up (April-December 2020). Patient characteristics (age, race, comorbidity, medications) were associated with differences in social distancing behaviors during the pandemic. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 in models incorporating behavior and other potential confounders (OR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.08, 1.89). Other medication classes were not associated with COVID-19 risk. Diabetes (OR: 1.72; 95%CI: 1.08, 2.73), cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.24, 2.28), and kidney disease (OR: 1.76; 95%CI: 1.04, 2.97) were associated with higher odds of COVID-19. Of the 2156 reporting pre-pandemic utilization of infusion, mental health or rehabilitative services, 975 (45.2%) reported disruptions therein, which disproportionately affected individuals experiencing changes to employment or income. CONCLUSIONS: Glucocorticoid exposure may increase risk of COVID-19 in people with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Disruption to healthcare and related services was common. Those with pandemic-related reduced income may be most vulnerable to care disruptions.","Fitzgerald, Kathryn C; Mecoli, Christopher A; Douglas, Morgan; Harris, Samantha; Aravidis, Berna; Albayda, Jemima; Sotirchos, Elias S; Hoke, Ahmet; Orbai, Ana-Maria; Petri, Michelle; Christopher-Stine, Lisa; Baer, Alan N; Paik, Julie J; Adler, Brittany L; Tiniakou, Eleni; Timlin, Homa; Bhargava, Pavan; Newsome, Scott D; Venkatesan, Arun; Chaudhry, Vinay; Lloyd, Thomas E; Pardo, Carlos A; Stern, Barney J; Lazarev, Mark; Truta, Brindusa; Saidha, Shiv; Chen, Edward S; Sharp, Michelle; Gilotra, Nisha; Kasper, Edward K; Gelber, Allan C; Bingham, Clifton O; Shah, Ami A; Mowry, Ellen M",Clin. infect. dis,62,23

Resistance to triclabendazole, one of the principal veterinary medicines used to prevent losses, has been reported and is now considered widespread in fluke endemic regions of the UK. METHODS: Thirteen farmers participated in a trial in 2013 and the triclabendazole resistance status was obtained for each farm. Based on these results, a knowledge exchange programme on fluke control was delivered to nearly 100 farmers in the region. In this follow-up study, 11 farmers involved in the original trial, participated in semistructured in-depth qualitative interviews in July 2017. RESULTS: Overall, participants identified benefits from participating in the 2013 trial, gaining information about triclabendazole resistance on their farms and knowledge about fluke control. The information on their farm's resistance status was a driver for changing their liver fluke control programmes. Factors such as habitual and repetitive behaviours, grazing restrictions due to agri-environmental schemes, economic pressures and climate change were identified that could impede or prevent the adoption of new control strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the significance of resistance to triclabendazole and the impact of knowledge exchange programmes in changing liver fluke control practices.","Coyne, Lucy Alice; Bellet, Camille; Latham, Sophia M; Williams, Diana",Vet. rec,62,23

Now declared a public health emergency, this pandemic is present in more than 200 countries with over 14 million cases and 600,000 deaths as of July 18, 2020. Primarily transmitted through the respiratory tract, the most common clinical presentations of symptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 include fever, dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and sore throat. In advanced cases, patients may rapidly develop respiratory failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even progress to death. While it is known that COVID-19 manifests similarly to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the 2012 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), primarily affecting the pulmonary system, the impact of the disease extends far beyond the respiratory system and affects other organs of the body. The literature regarding the extrapulmonary manifestations (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, ocular, dermatologic, and neurological) of COVID-19 is scant. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the organ-specific clinical manifestations of COVID-19, to increase awareness about the various organs affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to provide a brief insight into the similarities and differences in the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and the earlier SARS and MERS.","Johnson, Kemmian D.; Harris, Christen; Cain, John K.; Hummer, Cicily; Goyal, Hemant; Perisetti, Abhilash",Front.

Early reports confirmed the heavy burden of COVID-19 in SOT recipients with mortality rates reaching up to 35%. Because most transplant recipients harbored multiple comorbidities known to be associated with a severe course of COVID-19, the true impact of immunosuppression by itself remained an unsolved issue. Transplant societies have initially recommended to postpone non urgent renal transplantations, while trying to maintain life-saving transplant programs, such as heart, lung and liver transplantations. The pandemic thus resulted in an unprecedented and sudden drop of transplant activity worldwide. Moreover, the best treatment strategy in infected patients was challenging. Both reduction of immunosuppression and use of targeted therapies aiming at counteracting SARS-CoV-2 infection were the two faces of the therapeutic armamentarium. Recent controlled studies have better delineated the basis of mitigating and management strategies to improve patients' outcome. Nevertheless, and given the persistence of circulating virus, evidence-based recommendations in SOT recipients remain unclear. The resumption of transplant activity should be tailored with careful selection of both donors and recipients. Transplant decision should be made on a case-by-case basis after thorough assessment of the risks and benefits.","Zaidan, Mohamad; Legendre, Christophe",Transplantation,62,16

The main known transmission route of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 is through respiratory air droplets. Although recent studies have revealed that the virus is detectable in the throat, blood, urine, anal swabs, tears and even faeces;however, modes of transmission other than respiratory droplets has not been studied much. Knowledge on the presence of the virus in the female genital tract may help determine the risk of sexual transmission as well as the risk of mother-to-child transmission. However, not much data are available yet regarding the presence of the virus in the female genital system. Hence, to explore the presence of the virus in the female genital system and possibility of sexual transmission, a study was conducted where in we tried to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 in cervico-vaginal secretions. Methods: From July 2020 to September 2020, 35 COVID-19-positive female patients admitted to tertiary care teaching institute of Eastern India, which is now declared dedicated Corona Hospital and Centre of Excellence for COVID-19 care, who consented for the research were enrolled in this prospective observational study. Proper gynaecological history, clinical records along with laboratory findings of the patient was recorded. The possibility of the sexual transmission of the virus from female to her male partner was to be ascertained by testing the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 in the vaginal, cervical secretions by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Results: All 35 COVID-19-positive female patients were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 in their vaginal and cervical secretions by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. All the samples were tested negative for the virus. Conclusion: Findings from this study reveals that severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 is not present in the cervical and vaginal secretions, and the possibility of transmission from female to her male partner by vaginal sexual intercourse is unlikely.","Agarwal, M.; Basumatary, S.; Bhusan, D.; Pati, B.

A research project was undertaken to develop training modules using Social Determinants of Health (SDH) for PAs and PDTs involved in providing MATOD pharmacy services in regional Victoria, and to evaluate their effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to examine and evaluate changes in attitudes and practices amongst PAs and PDTs involved in MATOD services in regional Victoria, Australia and who had undertaken the training modules. METHODS: The paper reports primarily on the in-depth qualitative interviews that were completed after the training with PAs and PTDs. Thematic analysis was employed to code the data. RESULTS: Thematic analysis generated five themes: understanding of the professional role of PAs and PTDs, initial judgements concerning MATOD consumers, reflection on the SDH, training content analysis, and the post-training impact upon Professional Practice. These themes reflected participants' insights with regards both to MATOD consumers and the impact the training itself had had on their professional practice. CONCLUSION: ""Consciousness-raising"" from participation in the training can positively influence the development of participants' professional attitudes and practices with regards to MATOD service delivery. This development supports that training informed by SDH and ideas of critical reflection can help facilitate the creation of knowledge around the social construction of health and increased understanding of the impacts of language-use, attitudes and behaviour.","Patil, Tejaswini; Mummery, Jane; Salman, Mohammed; Cooper, Simon; Williams, Dominic",Res. soc. adm. pharm,62,26

METHODS: Analysis of enrolled participants in the CAPS5 Study, a prospective multicenter study of pancreatic cancer surveillance in high-risk individuals. RESULTS: Amongst 693 enrolled high-risk individuals under active surveillance, 108 (16%) had an EUS scheduled during the COVID-19 pandemic-related shutdown (median length of 78 days) in the spring of 2020, with 97% of these procedures being canceled. Of these canceled surveillance EUSs, 83% were rescheduled in a median of 4.1 months, however 17% were not rescheduled after 6 months follow-up. Prior history of cancer was associated with increased likelihood of rescheduling. To date no pancreatic cancer has been diagnosed among those whose surveillance was delayed.

We evaluated the impact of treatment delays related to COVID-19 on patients scheduled to undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy at our center. Data were collected in real time between March 19 and May 11, 2020, for patients who were delayed to cellular therapy. We evaluated the proportion of delayed patients who ultimately received cellular therapy, reasons for not proceeding to cellular therapy, and changes in disease and health status during delay. A total of 85 patients were delayed, including 42 patients planned for autologous HCT, 36 patients planned for allogeneic HCT, and 7 patients planned for CAR-T therapy. Fifty-six of these patients (66%) since received planned therapy. Five patients died during the delay. The most common reason for not proceeding to autologous HCT was good disease control in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias (75%). The most common reason for not proceeding to allogeneic HCT was progression of disease (42%). All patients with acute leukemia who progressed had measurable residual disease (MRD) at the time of delay, whereas no patient without MRD at the time of delay progressed. Six patients (86%) ultimately received CAR-T therapy, including 3 patients who progressed during the delay. For patients with high-risk disease such as acute leukemia, and particularly those with MRD at the time of planned HCT, treatment delay can result in devastating outcomes and should be avoided if at all possible.","Nawas, Mariam T; Shah, Gunjan L; Feldman, Darren R; Ruiz, Josel D; Robilotti, Elizabeth V; Aslam, Anoshe A; Dundas, Mary; Kamboj, Mini; Barker, Juliet N; Cho, Christina; Chung, David J; Dahi, Parastoo B; Giralt, Sergio A; Gyurkocza, Boglarka; Lahoud, Oscar B; Landau, Heather J; Lin, Richard J; Mailankody, Sham; Palomba, M Lia; Papadopoulos, Esperanza B; Politikos, Ioannis; Ponce, Doris M; Sauter, Craig S; Shaffer, Brian C; Scordo, Michael; van den Brink, Marcel R M; Perales, Miguel-Angel; Tamari, Roni",,62,16

In this prospective cohort study, we assessed neurological and cognitive symptoms in hospitalized coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients and aimed to determine their neuronal correlates. Patients with reverse transcription-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection who required inpatient treatment primarily because of non-neurological complications were screened between 20 April 2020 and 12 May 2020. Patients (age > 18 years) were included in our cohort when presenting with at least one new neurological symptom (defined as impaired gustation and/or olfaction, performance < 26 points on a Montreal Cognitive Assessment and/or pathological findings on clinical neurological examination). Patients with &#8805;2 new symptoms were eligible for further diagnostics using comprehensive neuropsychological tests, cerebral MRI and 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET as soon as infectivity was no longer present. Exclusion criteria were: premorbid diagnosis of cognitive impairment, neurodegenerative diseases or intensive care unit treatment. Of 41 COVID-19 inpatients screened, 29 patients (65.2 ± 14.4 years; 38% female) in the subacute stage of disease were included in the register. Most frequently, gustation and olfaction were disturbed in 29/29 and 25/29 patients, respectively. Montreal Cognitive Assessment performance was impaired in 18/26 patients (mean score 21.8/30) with emphasis on frontoparietal cognitive functions. This was confirmed by detailed neuropsychological testing in 15 patients. 18FDG PET revealed pathological results in 10/15 patients with predominant frontoparietal hypometabolism. This pattern was confirmed by comparison with a control sample using voxel-wise principal components analysis, which showed a high correlation (R2 = 0.62) with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment performance. Post-mortem examination of one patient revealed white matter microglia activation but no signs of neuroinflammation. Neocortical dysfunction accompanied by cognitive decline was detected in a relevant fraction of patients with subacute COVID-19 initially requiring inpatient treatment. This is of major rehabilitative and socioeconomic relevance.","Hosp, Jonas A; Dressing, Andrea; Blazhenets, Ganna; Bormann, Tobias; Rau, Alexander; Schwabenland, Marius; Thurow, Johannes; Wagner, Dirk; Waller, Cornelius; Niesen, Wolf D; Frings, Lars; Urbach, Horst; Prinz, Marco; Weiller, Cornelius; Schroeter, Nils; Meyer, Philipp T",Brain,62,16

This report summarizes progress toward global polio eradication during January 1, 2018-March 31, 2020 and updates previous reports (1,2). In 2019, Afghanistan and Pakistan reported the highest number of WPV1 cases (176) since 2014. During January 1-March 31, 2020 (as of June 19), 54 WPV1 cases were reported, an approximate fourfold increase from 12 cases during the corresponding period in 2019. Paralytic poliomyelitis can also be caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), which emerges when attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) virus reverts to neurovirulence following prolonged circulation in underimmunized populations (3). Since the global withdrawal of type 2-containing OPV (OPV2) in April 2016, cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreaks have increased in number and geographic extent (4). During January 2018-March 2020, 21 countries reported 547 cVDPV2 cases. Complicating increased poliovirus transmission during 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and mitigation efforts have resulted in suspension of immunization activities and disruptions to poliovirus surveillance. When the COVID-19 emergency subsides, enhanced support will be needed to resume polio eradication field activities.","Chard, Anna N; Datta, S Deblina; Tallis, Graham; Burns, Cara C; Wassilak, Steven G F; Vertefeuille, John F; Zaffran, Michel",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,62,23

To test our assumptions, we use survey data from 155 top managers of Croatian SMEs operating in business-to-business industries. We find that an SME?s proactivity positively (negatively) influences the emergence of positive (negative) emotions. Also, we find that top managers charged with positive (negative) emotions are more prone to engage in investment (divestment) as a response to economic crisis. Furthermore, through the broaden-and-build perspective we reveal the mediating effect of emotions on the relationship between proactivity and response intentions as well as the mediating effect of performance expectations on the link between emotions and response intentions.JEL CLASSIFICATION M10;M19","Miocevic, Dario",BRQ Business Research Quarterly,62,16

Adolescence is a time when individuals observe physical changes in their bodies, experience new interests and desires, and find themselves with greater freedom, independence and responsibility;although variably defined, adolescence is generally believed to begin with the onset of puberty and end with assuming social roles as adults (Dahl 2004, Spear 2000). Among the changes that the adolescent has to face are: accepting one's body, acquiring a social role, female or male, establishing new relationships with peers of both sexes, achieving emotional independence from parents and other adults, acquiring social behavior responsible, learn a system of values and an ethical conscience as a guide to one's behavior, develop intellectual skills and prepare for a profession, achieve independence (Juli 2020). All this is not always easy and, many times young people find themselves facing a tortuous path that can give rise to the onset of some mental pathologies;if we then take into account the pandemic period we are experiencing, all this can get complicated.

Consequently, the official intervention has focused on conventional wisdom --- social distancing, hand washing, etc. --- while critical decisions such as the cancellation of large events like festivals, workshops and academic conferences are done on a case-by-case basis with limited information about local risks. Adding to this uncertainty is the fact that our mathematical models tend to assume some level of random mixing patterns instead of the higher-order structures necessary to describe these large events. Here, we discuss a higher-order description of epidemic dynamics on networks that provides a natural way of extending common models to interaction beyond simple pairwise contacts. We show that unlike the classic diffusion of standard epidemic models, higher-order interactions can give rise to mesoscopic localization, i.e., a phenomenon in which there is a concentration of the epidemic around certain substructures in the network. We discuss the implications of these results and show the potential impact of a blanket cancellation of events larger than a certain critical size. Unlike standard models of delocalized dynamics, epidemics in a localized phase can suddenly collapse when facing an intervention operating over structures rather than individuals.","St-Onge, Guillaume; Thibeault, Vincent; Allard, Antoine; Dub'e, Louis J.; H'ebert-Dufresne, Laurent",,62,15

Although initially, this pandemic was associated with causing severe pulmonary and respiratory disorders, recent case studies reported the association of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, which is also life-threatening. Several SARS-CoV-2 positive case studies have been reported where there are mild or no symptoms of this virus. However, a selection of patients are suffering from large artery ischemic strokes. Although the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus affecting the cerebrovascular system has not been elucidated yet, researchers have identified several pathogenic mechanisms, including a role for the ACE2 receptor. Therefore, it is extremely crucial to identify the risk factors related to the progression and adverse outcome of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Since many articles have reported the effect of smoking (tobacco and cannabis) and vaping in cerebrovascular and neurological systems, and considering that smokers are more prone to viral and bacterial infection compared to non-smokers, it is high time to explore the probable correlation of smoking in COVID-19 patients. Herein, we have reviewed the possible role of smoking and vaping on cerebrovascular and neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, along with potential pathogenic mechanisms associated with it.","Archie, Sabrina Rahman; Cucullo, Luca",,62,16

Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 1124 HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 30, 2020, to April 2, 2020). Demographic data, questions on COVID-19 and scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were analysed using the chi-square test (Bonferroni correction) and binary logistic regression. Results: The study consists of 1124 HCWs, including 749 doctors, 207 nurses, 135 paramedics, 23 administrators and ten supporting staff members. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were reported as 37.2% and 31.4%, respectively. The risk factors for anxiety were female gender (30.6% vs 45.5%), age group (20-35 years) (50.4% vs 61.2%), unmarried (21.2% vs 30.6%) and job profile (nurse) (14.7% vs 26.4%). The protective factor was having service of more than 20 years (23.4% vs 14.8%). The risk factors for depression were age group (20-35 years) (51.3% vs 61.3%) and employed at a primary care hospital (16.2% vs 23.4%). The protective factors were job profile (doctor) (69.9% vs 59.6%) and having service of more than 20 years (22.3% vs 15.5%). Conclusion: Approximately one-third of the HCWs reported anxiety and depressive symptoms. The risk factors for anxiety symptoms were female gender, younger age and job profile (nurse) and for depressive symptoms were younger age and working at a primary care hospital. Future research studies should identify strategies for providing a safer and supportive work environment for HCWs to face epidemics/pandemics.","Gupta, Simmi; Prasad, Ajay Shankar; Dixit, Prashant Kumar; Padmakumari, P; Gupta, Salil; Abhisheka, Kumar",,62,1

Geographical information system (GIS) web mapping and applications contribute to a better representation of PQI spatial distribution. Unlike many countries in the world, in Portugal, this type of application remains underdeveloped. The main objective of this work was to facilitate the assessment of geographical patterns and trends of health data in Portugal. Therefore, two innovative open source applications were developed. Leaflet Javascript Library, PostGIS, and GeoServer were used to create a web map application prototype. Python language was used to develop the GIS application. The geospatial assessment of geographical patterns of health data in Portugal can be obtained through a GIS application and a web map application. Both tools proposed allowed for an easy and intuitive assessment of geographical patterns and time trends of PQI values in Portugal, alongside other relevant health data, i.e., the location of health care facilities, which, in turn, showed some association between the location of facilities and quality of health care.

Universal influenza vaccine candidates targeting highly conserved antigens of IAV nucleoprotein (NP) are promising as vaccines that induce T cell immunity, but concerns have been raised about the safety of inducing robust CD8 T cell responses in the lungs. Using a mouse model, we systematically evaluated effects of recombinant adenovirus vectors (rAd) expressing IAV NP (A/NP-rAd) or influenza B virus (IBV) NP (B/NP-rAd) on pulmonary inflammation and function after vaccination and following live IAV challenge. After A/NP-rAd or B/NP-rAd vaccination, female mice exhibited robust systemic and pulmonary vaccine-specific B cell and T cell responses and experienced no morbidity (e.g., body mass loss). Both in vivo pulmonary function testing and lung histopathology scoring revealed minimal adverse effects of intranasal rAd vaccination compared with unvaccinated mice. After IAV challenge, A/NP-rAd-vaccinated mice experienced significantly less morbidity, had lower pulmonary virus titers, and developed less pulmonary inflammation than unvaccinated or B/NP-rAd-vaccinated mice. Based on analysis of pulmonary physiology using detailed testing not previously applied to the question of T cell damage, mice protected by vaccination also had better lung function than controls. Results provide evidence that, in this model, adenoviral universal influenza vaccine does not damage pulmonary tissue. In addition, adaptive immunity, in particular, T cell immunity in the lungs, does not cause damage when restimulated but instead mitigates pulmonary damage following IAV infection.IMPORTANCE Respiratory viruses can emerge and spread rapidly before vaccines are available. It would be a tremendous advance to use vaccines that protect against whole categories of viruses, such as universal influenza vaccines, without the need to predict which virus will emerge. The nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza virus provides a target conserved among strains and is a dominant T cell target. In animals, vaccination to NP generates powerful T cell immunity and long-lasting protection against diverse influenza strains. Concerns have been raised, but not evaluated experimentally, that potent local T cell responses might damage the lungs. We analyzed lung function in detail in the setting of such a vaccination. Despite CD8 T cell responses in the lungs, lungs were not damaged and functioned normally after vaccination alone and were protected upon subsequent infection. This precedent provides important support for vaccines based on T cell-mediated protection, currently being considered for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Dhakal, Santosh; Loube, Jeffrey; Misplon, Julia A; Lo, Chia-Yun; Creisher, Patrick S; Mulka, Kathleen R; Deshpande, Sharvari; Mitzner, Wayne; Klein, Sabra L; Epstein, Suzanne L",J. virol,62,26

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that the sense of agency is associated with a brain network including the pre-supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal parietal cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation affected the sense of agency only when delivered over the pre-SMA and specifically when time-locked to action planning, rather than when the physical consequences of the actions appeared.

Among multiple biological and environmental factors, hypovitaminosis D is a credible candidate. The aim of this study is to shed light on the pathogenic role of vitamin D deficiency in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and in the aggressive immune and inflammatory response by the host. We retrospectively analyzed the biochemical panel of immune system markers and the tandem mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (LC-MS-MS) measured vitamin D, in the serum samples of patients with SARS-CoV-2 studied in all aspects of clinical relevant parameters. RESULTS between 18th March and 20th April 2020 we enrolled 29 consecutive patients with COVID-19. They were 17 (58.6%) males and 12 (41.4) females, and the median age was 79 (69–88) years. Mean 25OHD was 17.3±2.1 ng/ml, with a median of 15.7 1 ng/ml (i.r. 6.7–25). Twenty-five patients (86.2%) had 25OHD levels &amp;lt;30 ng/ml, 18 patients (62.0%) had 25OHD levels &amp;lt;20 ng/ml and 10 patients (34.5%) had severe vitamin D deficiency (&amp;lt;10 ng/ml). In the group of patients with severe disease (ARDS, cardiovascular complications, CID) 69.2% (n=9/13) of patients presented hypovitaminosis D (&amp;lt;20 ng/ml). All patients who dead for COVID-19 during hospitalization (n=6) had 25OHD≤30 ng/ml and 5/6 had 25OHD≤20 ng/ml. IL-6 and CRP were measured in all patients and were considered surrogate markers of cytokines storm. The majority of patients had levels of IL-6 (n=22, 75.8%) and CRP (n=25, 86.2%) above the upper limit of the reference range of our laboratory (IL6 6.59 and CRP 1 mg/dl) and the median was IL 6=16.1 (i.r. 7.3–36.3) and CRP=6.67 (2.64–11.52). Patients with 25OHD &amp;lt;20 ng/ml had higher levels of IL-6 (p=0.004;19.9 vs 10.4) and CRP (p=0.009, 9.85 vs 1.40) and did not differ for the other clinical and biochemical variables. If we considered as 25OHD cut-off the mean value in our population (17.3 ng/ml), patients with lower levels of 25OHD had higher age (p=0.033) and higher levels of IL6 (p=0.016), CRP (p=0.04), troponin (p=0.04) and D-dimer (p=0.017), compared to the others. An inverse correlation was found between 25OHD levels and IL-6, CRP, and troponin. In a univariate regression analysis hypovitaminosis D (&amp;lt;20 ng/ml) was a predictive factor for IL6 (expressed as LnIL6) levels (β=0.57, P=0.003) and for PCR levels (β=0.42, P=0.034). We also performed a multivariate regression analysis with hypovitaminosis D (&amp;lt;20 ng/ml), sex, BMI, age (&amp;lt;70 years) and ARDS as independent variables. Notably, hypovitaminosis D (β=0.49, P&amp;lt;0.02), BMI (β=0.4, P=0.04) and ARDS (β=0.44, P=0.02) were confirmed to be significant variables for IL6 (expressed as LnIL6) level prediction. In the same multivariate model hypovitaminosis D (β=0.49, P=0.034) was confirmed as independent predictor of CRP levels. In conclusion, hypovitaminosis D is related to the negative prognostic inflammatory status in patients with SARS-Cov2.","Saponaro, Federica",Journal of the Endocrine Society,62,30

This system, referred to as DP3T, provides a technological foundation to help slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by simplifying and accelerating the process of notifying people who might have been exposed to the virus so that they can take appropriate measures to break its transmission chain. The system aims to minimise privacy and security risks for individuals and communities and guarantee the highest level of data protection. The goal of our proximity tracing system is to determine who has been in close physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person and thus exposed to the virus, without revealing the contact's identity or where the contact occurred. To achieve this goal, users run a smartphone app that continually broadcasts an ephemeral, pseudo-random ID representing the user's phone and also records the pseudo-random IDs observed from smartphones in close proximity. When a patient is diagnosed with COVID-19, she can upload pseudo-random IDs previously broadcast from her phone to a central server. Prior to the upload, all data remains exclusively on the user's phone. Other users' apps can use data from the server to locally estimate whether the device's owner was exposed to the virus through close-range physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person who has uploaded their data. In case the app detects a high risk, it will inform the user.","Troncoso, Carmela; Payer, Mathias; Hubaux, Jean-Pierre; Salath'e, Marcel; Larus, James; Bugnion, Edouard; Lueks, Wouter; Stadler, Theresa; Pyrgelis, Apostolos; Antonioli, Daniele; Barman, Ludovic; Chatel, Sylvain; Paterson, Kenneth; vCapkun, Srdjan; Basin, David; Beutel, Jan; Jackson, Dennis; Roeschlin, Marc; Leu, Patrick; Preneel, Bart; Smart, Nigel; Abidin, Aysajan; Gurses, Seda; Veale, Michael; Cremers, Cas; Backes, Michael; Tippenhauer, Nils Ole; Binns, Reuben; Cattuto, Ciro; Barrat, Alain; Fiore, Dario; Barbosa, Manuel; Oliveira, Rui; Pereira, Jos'e",,62,24

RESULTS: A total of 367 air and surface swab samples were collected from the patient care areas of 15 patients with mild COVID-19 and nine patients with severe/critical COVID-19. Only one air sample taken during the intubation procedure tested positive. High-touch surfaces were slightly more likely to be contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA than low-touch surfaces. Contamination rates were slightly higher near severe/critical patients than near mild patients, although this difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Surface contamination was still found near the patients with both positive IgG and IgM. CONCLUSIONS: Air and surface contamination with viral RNA was relatively low in these healthcare settings after the enhancement of infection prevention and control.

Thirty-seven (4.5%) of the entire cohort had some risk factors for immunosuppression: chronic steroid use (nine), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (13), biologic medications (six), transplant recipients (two) and immunocompromising diseases (four). Only 4/18 patients had an immunosuppression risk in that all four of these patients were HIV-positive. Surveillance following excision was undertaken for an average of 6 (range 1-12) months, during which time four patients underwent a repeat biopsy. DISCUSSION: Anal dysplasia found in an otherwise asymptomatic population has a prevalence of 2.2%. This finding supports the routine examination of benign anorectal specimens undergoing microscopic examination. Interestingly, the majority of the patients identified had no immunosuppressant risk factors.","Kavalukas, S L; Yang, F; Wexner, S D; Nogueras, J J",Colorectal dis,62,1

METHODS: Using data from 96 out of 167 health facilities offering ART services, we compared four ART program indicators: (1) count of HIV visits; (2) proportion of ART dispenses in community-based settings (DAC); (3) proportion of multi-month dispensing of ART medications > 6 months (> 6 m MMD); and (4) proportion of timely ART refills. We used uncontrolled interrupted time series (ITS) models to estimate slope and level changes in each indicator with the arrival of COVID-19. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From week 1 to week 16, the average number of HIV visits fell from 121.5 to 92.5 visits, the proportion of DAC rose from 22.7% to 36.7%, the proportion of > 6 m MMD rose from 29.4% to 48.4%, and the proportion of timely ART refills fell from 51.9% to 43.8%. The ITS models estimated abrupt increases of 36% in > 6 m MMD (p < 0.001) and 37% in DAC (p < 0.001) at the time of COVID-19 arrival, and no change after arrival of COVID-19. The was an abrupt decline of 18% in timely ART refills with the arrival of COVID-19 and a decline of 1% per week thereafter, both non-statistically significant changes. CONCLUSIONS: The sudden changes in HIV service utilization represent dramatic adaptations needed to mitigate primary and secondary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on PLHIV. This study underscores the urgency of optimizing ART delivery models in Haiti and beyond, in order to maintain progress toward HIV epidemic control.","Celestin, Kemar; Allorant, Adrien; Virgin, Michelle; Marinho, Elisma; Francois, Kesner; Honoré, Jean Guy; White, Christina; Valles, Jean Solon; Perrin, Georges; De Kerorguen, Nicolas; Flowers, Jan; Balan, Jean Gabriel; Koama, Jean Baptiste T; Barnhart, Scott; Puttkammer, Nancy",AIDS Behav,62,30

METHODS: The demographic, symptoms, and physiological parameters of 88 patients were collected and analyzed. The performance of complete blood count (CBC) indexes for monitoring and predicting the severity of COVID-19 in patients was evaluated by analyzing and comparing CBC results among different COVID-19 patient groups. RESULTS: White blood cells (WBCs), the neutrophil percentage (Neu%), absolute neutrophil count (Neu#), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher in the critical group than in the other three groups (P < .05), while the lymphocyte percentage (Lym%), monocyte percentage (Mon%), lymphocyte count (Lym#), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) were significantly lower in the critical group than in the other three groups (P < .05). WBCs, the Neu%, Neu#, NLR, and neutrophil-to-monocyte ratio (NMR) were significantly higher in the severe group than in the mild and moderate groups (P < .05), while the Lym% was significantly lower in the severe group than in the mild and moderate groups (P < .05). The Mon%, Lym#, and LMR were significantly lower in the severe group than in the moderate group (P < .05). Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to differentiate severe and nonsevere patients, the areas under the curve (AUCs) for the NLR, Neu%, and Lym% were 0.733, 0.732, and 0.730, respectively. When differentiating critical patients from noncritical patients, the AUCs for the NLR, Neu%, and Lym% were 0.832, 0.831, and 0.831.

For this research to be successful, it is necessary to understand the pathology of the virus. So far, we know that this virus can harm different organs of the body. Although the exact mechanisms are still unknown, this phenomenon may result from the body's secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is involved in several inflammation and immunity pathways. Noticeably, the expression of this molecule can lead to a cytokine storm causing a variety of side effects. In this paper, we discuss those side effects in SARS-COV-2 infection separately to determine whether PGE2 is, indeed, an important causative factor. Lastly, we propose a mechanism by which PGE2 production increases in response to COVID-19 disease and suggest the possible direct relation between PGE2 levels and the severity of this disease.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, using data collected via an online self-reported questionnaire, from 3,388 participants. To assess the differences in mean scores, and identify factors associated with knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward COVID-19, the data were run through univariate and multivariable regression analyses, respectively. Results: The majority of the study participants were knowledgeable about COVID-19. The mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 17.96 (SD = 2.24, range: 3–22), indicating a high level of knowledge. The mean score for attitude was 28.23 (SD = 2.76, range: 6–30), indicating optimistic attitudes. The mean score for practices was 4.34 (SD = 0.87, range: 0–5), indicating good practices. However, the results showed that men have less knowledge, less optimistic attitudes, and less good practice toward COVID-19, than women. We also found that older adults are likely to have better knowledge and practices, than younger people.

These trials are conducted in a French Regional Health Agency (ARS) authorized structure. In March 2020, faced to the global COVID-19 pandemic and the French national lockdown measures, the CIC-1427 had to rapidly adapt its operating procedures to ensure the safety of both patients and staff. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Ensuring optimal management of patients included in early phase clinical trials, while respecting the good clinical and professional practices (GCP/GPP) of the CICs protocol sponsors' requirements, patients' safety and clinical research multidisciplinary staff safety (nurses, caregivers' assistants (AS), clinical research assistants (CRA), clinical trial coordinators (CTC), project leaders, health executive and investigating physicians), in the context of the health crisis related to COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Due to their activity, requiring on-site presence, each staff member of the CIC-1427 clinical research team had to adapt their daily activity to the constraints of the health crisis. New specific procedures were quickly developed to deal with the pandemic. Most of the on-site medical visits were replaced by virtual consults with biological assessments in the local laboratories. ""Remote monitoring"" replaced on-site monitoring visits. Treatments were sent to each patient's home via couriers after agreement of the CPPs of each protocol (Committee for the Protection of Persons). The essential visits were maintained on site thanks to the unfailing involvement of our clinical care team, with implementation of a specific sanitary protocol. CONCLUSION: The involvement of our entire multidisciplinary research team ensured that each patient was able to benefit from a personalized follow-up and to continue the treatment on-trial. The newly introduced procedures also allowed collection of a maximum of safety and efficacy data for clinical trial sponsors while complying with good regulatory practices. This set of procedures developed during the first epidemic wave, fundamentally helped setting the frame for a better coping during the subsequent pandemic waves.","Ghrieb, Zineb; Allaoua, Souhil; Huang, Jin; Langner, Nathalie; François, Florène; Maréchal, Corinne; Jebali, Majdi; Lebbé, Céleste; Chellah, Abdennour; Bergeron, Anne; Kiladjian, Jean-Jacques; Daltro De Oliveira, Rafael; Soret-Dulphy, Juliette; Benajiba, Lina",Therapie,62,6

Early analyses indicated that baseline quality was not predictive of nursing home cases, but a more nuanced study of the role of nurse staffing is needed to target resources and better respond to future outbreaks. We sought to understand whether baseline nurse staffing is associated with the presence of COVID-19 in nursing homes and whether staffing impacts outbreak severity. DESIGN: We analyzed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) facility-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths merged with nursing home and county characteristics. We used logistic regressions to examine the associations of staffing levels from Nursing Home Compare with the outcomes of any COVID-19 cases and, conditional on at least one case, an outbreak. Among facilities with at least one case, we modeled count of deaths using hurdle negative binomial-2 regressions. SETTING: All nursing homes in the CMS COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset with reports that passed the CMS Quality Assurance Check as of June 25, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of nursing homes that met COVID-19 reporting requirements. MEASUREMENTS: A nursing home is defined as having at least one case is if one or more confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case among residents or staff is reported. Conditional on at least one case, we examine two outcomes: an outbreak, defined as confirmed cases/certified beds >10% or total confirmed and suspected cases/beds >20% or >10 deaths, and the total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 among residents and staff. RESULTS: A total of 71% of the 13,167 nursing homes that reported COVID-19 data as of June 14 had at least one case among residents and/or staff. Of those, 27% experienced an outbreak. Higher registered nurse-hours are associated with a higher probability of experiencing any cases. However, among facilities with at least one case, higher nurse aide (NA) hours and total nursing hours are associated with a lower probability of experiencing an outbreak and with fewer deaths. The strongest predictor of cases and outbreaks in nursing homes is per capita cases in the county. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the community remains the strongest predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing homes, but higher NA hours and total nursing hours may help contain the number of cases and deaths.","Gorges, Rebecca J; Konetzka, R Tamara",J. am. geriatr. soc,62,26

Herein, we prepared hyaluronic acid-functionalized regenerated silk fibroin-based nanoparticles (NPs) loading with photosensitizer (NIR770) and doxorubicin (DOX). The resultant HNDNPs had a desirable diameter of 161.0 nm and a negative zeta-potential of -30.5 mV. Interestingly, they showed excellent responses when triggered with various stimuli (acidity, reactive oxygen species, glutathione, hyaluronidase, or hyperthermia). Cell experiments revealed that HNDNPs could be specifically internalized by A549 cells, and efficiently released the payloads into the cytoplasm. Moreover, NIR770 was preferentially retained in mitochondria due to its lipophilic and cationic properties, which exhibited highly efficient photothermal therapy and photodynamic therapy upon near infrared (NIR) irradiation. Meanwhile, DOX molecules were mainly accumulated in the nucleus. Intravenous injection of HNDNPs into mice followed by NIR irradiation provided excellent multimodal imaging (NIR, photothermal, and photoacoustic imaging), almost eliminated the entire tumor, and greatly prolonged mice survival time with no side effects. Our study demonstrates that this HNDNP, which integrates the functions of tumor targeting, on-demand drug release, multimodal imaging, mitochondrial phototherapy, and chemotherapy, can be exploited as a promising nanococktail for imaging-guided synergistic treatment of cancer.","Gou, Shuangquan; Yang, Jun; Ma, Ya; Zhang, Xueqing; Zu, Menghang; Kang, Ting; Liu, Siyu; Ke, Bowen; Xiao, Bo",J Control Release,62,1

A multicenter ambispective analysis was performed in nine centers in Spain during a 4-month period. Data were collected from every patient, including changes in treatments, referrals or delays in surgeries, changes in surgical approaches, postoperative outcomes and perioperative SARS-CoV-2 status. The hospital's response to the outbreak and available resources were categorized, and outcomes were divided into periods based on the timeline of the pandemic. A total of 301 patients were included by the study centers and 259 (86%) underwent surgery. Five hospitals went into phase III during the peak of incidence period, one remained in phase II and three in phase I. More than 60% of patients suffered some form of change: 48% referrals, 39% delays, 4% of rectal cancer patients had a prolonged interval to surgery and 5% underwent neoadjuvant treatment. At the time of study closure, 3% did not undergo surgery. More than 85% of the patients were tested preoperatively for SARS-CoV-2.

Acetylation of several proteins plays essential roles in various biological processes, such as viral infections. We reported that the nucleoproteins of influenza virus and Zaire Ebolavirus were acetylated, suggesting that these modifications contributed to the molecular events involved in viral replication. Similar to influenza virus and Ebolavirus, the coronavirus also contains single-stranded RNA, as its viral genome interacts with the nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In this study, we report that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins are strongly acetylated by human histone acetyltransferases, P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), and general control nonderepressible 5 (GCN5), but not by CREB-binding protein (CBP) in vitro. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses identified 2 and 12 acetyl-lysine residues from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, respectively. Particularly in the SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, the acetyl-lysine residues were localized in or close to several functional sites, such as the RNA interaction domains and the M-protein interacting site. These results suggest that acetylation of SARS-CoV-2 N proteins plays crucial roles in their functions.","Hatakeyama, Dai; Masuda, Takeshi; Miki, Ryosuke; Ohtsuki, Sumio; Kuzuhara, Takashi",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,62,6

Availability of laboratory COVID-19 testing capacity using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was essential for case detection. Hence, it was critical to establish and expand this capacity to test for COVID-19 in Ethiopia. To this end, using a three-phrased approach, potential public and private laboratories with RT-PCR technology were assessed, capacitated with trained human resource and equipped as required. These laboratories were verified to conduct COVID-19 testing with quality assurance checks regularly conducted. Within a 10-month period, COVID-19 testing laboratories increased from zero to 65 in all Regional States with the capacity to conduct 18,454 tests per day. The success of this rapid countrywide expansion of laboratory testing capacity for COVID-19 depended on some key operational implications: the strong laboratory coordination network within the country, the use of non-virologic laboratories, investment in capacity building, digitalization of the data for better information management and establishing quality assurance checks. A weak supply chain for laboratory reagents and consumables, differences in the brands of COVID-19 test kits, frequent breakdowns of the PCR machines and inadequate number of laboratory personnel following the adaption of a 24/7 work schedule were some of the challenges experienced during the process of laboratory expansion. Overall, we learn that multisectoral involvement of laboratories from non-health sectors, an effective supply chain system with an insight into the promotion of local production of laboratory supplies were critical during the laboratory expansion for COVID-19 testing. The consistent support from WHO and other implementing partners to Member States is needed in building the capacity of laboratories across different diagnostic capabilities in line with International Health Regulations. This will enable efficient adaptation to respond to future public health emergencies.","Kebede, Adisu; Lanyero, Betty; Beyene, Berhane; Mandalia, Mayur Lalji; Melese, Daniel; Girmachew, Feven; Mekonnen, Adamu; Ayana, Gonfa; Yemanebirhan, Nebiyou; Hailu, Getnet; Asrat, Habtamu; Nurahmed, Negash; Gashu, Andargachew; Eshetu, Kirubel; Assefa, Zewdu; Abayneh, Aschalew; Musa, Emmanuel; Abate, Ebba",Pan Afr Med J,62,6

We found that a five-topic model was the best in representing the data corpus, including: (i) the public's perception of gambling addiction amid the COVID-19 outbreak, (ii) risks and support available for those who stay at home, (iii) the users' interpretation of gambling addiction, (iv) forms of gambling during the pandemic, and (v) gambling advertising and impact on families. Sentiment analysis showed a prevalence of underlying fear, trust, sadness, and anger, across the corpus. Users viewed the pandemic as a driver of problematic gambling behaviors, possibly exposing unprepared individuals and communities to forms of online gambling, with potential long-term consequences and a significant impact on health systems.

Earlier results from APOGEE pointed to a large contribution of destroyed GCs to the stellar content of the inner halo, by as much as 25$\%$, which is an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates for more distant regions of the halo. We set out to measure the ratio between N-rich and normal halo field stars, as a function of distance, by performing density modelling of halo field populations in APOGEE DR16. Our results show that at 1.5 kpc from the Galactic Centre, N-rich stars contribute a much higher 16$^{+12}_{-7}$$\%$ fraction to the total stellar halo mass budget than the 2$^{+1}_{-0.7}$$\%$ ratio contributed at 15 kpc. Under the assumption that N-rich stars are former GC members that now reside in the stellar halo field, and assuming the ratio between first-and second-population GC stars being 1-to-2, we estimate a total contribution from disrupted GC stars of the order of 24.7$^{+16}_{-10}$$\%$ at r = 1.5 kpc and 3$^{+1.5}_{-1}$$\%$ at r = 15 kpc. Furthermore, since our methodology compels us to fit a density model to the stellar halo, we integrate such density within a spherical shell from 1.5-20 kpc in radius, and find a total stellar mass arising from dissolved and/or evaporated GCs of $M_{\mathrm{GC,total}}$ = 10$^{+3.7}_{-2.5}$ $\times$ 10$^{7}$ M$\odot$.","Horta, Danny; Mackereth, J.

Primary outcomes were intra-operative/post-operative fentanyl requirements, and numerical pain scores (at 1 and 3 hours post-operatively). The study ran from October 2019 but was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-parametric statistical tests were used. Results: 25 patients were randomised. Those receiving pre-incisional LA had lower fentanyl requirements intra-operatively (mean;150mcg vs 186mcg, p&lt;0.05) but similar requirements post-operatively. Mean pain scores were lower in the pre-incisional LA group at 1 hour (1.2 vs 2.3, p&lt;0.05) and 3 hours post-operatively (0.7 vs 1.3, p&gt;0.4). Conclusions: Pre-incisional infiltration of LA led to a significantly reduced requirement for intra-operative fentanyl, and significantly lower pain scores at 1 hour post-operatively. Larger studies should interrogate this effect at individual procedure level and assess for differences in rates of chronic pain.","Jones, C.; Baker-Wilding, R.; Coombs, N.",British Journal of Surgery,62,13

Intercontinental trends in neurosurgeons' perception and practices of telemedicine have been sparingly reported. METHODS: We conducted an online anonymized and validated survey using a structured questionnaire to gain insight into neurosurgeons' experience with telemedicine across various continents and rated its usefulness on a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: We received 286 responses across 5 continents. There was a trend to support a major paradigm shift favoring teleconsultations during the COVID-19 pandemic in respondents from North America (P = 0.06). Signed prescriptions were e-mailed along with video-based teleconsultations preferentially in Europe and North America. In comparison, audio- or text-based teleconsultations along with unsigned prescriptions were prevalent in Asia and Africa (P = 0.0005). Acceptability and perceived usefulness for telemedicine during the pandemic were similar across the globe, regardless of neurosurgeons' experience (mean satisfaction score 3.72 ± 1.09; P = 0.62). A majority of neurosurgeons from Asia and South America complained of difficulties during teleconsultations owing to lack of appropriate infrastructure, internet connectivity/prescription-related issues, and potential risk of litigation (P = 0.0005). Approximately 46% of neurosurgeons, predominantly from Europe and North America, thought that telemedicine could play a vital role in clinical practice even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides (mean satisfaction score 3.26 ± 1.16; P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine in neurosurgery is a viable alternative to physical outpatient services during the COVID-19 pandemic and could potentially play a vital role after the pandemic.","Tandon, Vivek; Raheja, Amol; Mishra, Shashwat; Garg, Kanwaljeet; Dash, Chinmaya; Borkar, Sachin A; Wellington, Jack; Chaurasia, Bipin; Fontanella, Marco M; Suri, Ashish; Chandra, P Sarat; Kale, Shashank S",World Neurosurg,62,16

These include the European Commission's European Green Deal, Coronavirus Recovery Plan and revamped Hydrogen Strategy; international calls for a green, sustainable and just coronavirus recovery; a global revival of Keynesian supply-side economics; and increasing interest in direct central bank funding of government stimulus programmes. In this essay I offer a first attempt to draw these elements together to suggest what might be a coherent strategy for action, at least for countries with stable, resilient currencies. One of the key elements would be for central banks to finance their governments’ decarbonization programmes directly by buying government bonds and holding them in perpetuity as insurance against misallocation of funds. The losers in such a strategy would be elements in the finance sector which have come to rely on virtually free bailouts and handouts from central banks via quantitative easing programmes. Resistance to the proposed strategy would probably be fierce from these quarters.","Galvin, Ray",Energy Res. Soc. Sci.,62,1

A literature review revealed few reports providing front-line clinical and research teams guidance related to multilevel, rapidly evolving COVID-19 directives. METHOD: The Rapid Assessment Procedure Informed Clinical Ethnography (RAPICE) method was used to develop a clinical case series and conduct participant observation during an ongoing comparative effectiveness trial of peer-integrated, patient-centered interventions after traumatic injury. Participants were patients enrolled in the intervention arm of the ongoing trial, as well as front-line clinicians, patient peer interventionists, and clinical research team members implementing the trial. All participants were exposed to the Washington State COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: Primary and secondary COVID-19 prevention strategies were feasibly integrated into ongoing care coordination and behavioral interventions for at-risk patients. Beyond the compilation of case studies, as an iterative method, RAPICE data collection naturalistically evolved to include observations of intervention team activity occurring within the larger pandemic epicenter context. A daily clinical research team huddle that flexibly accommodated virtual participation was also feasibly implemented. CONCLUSIONS: Primary and secondary COVID-19 prevention strategies can be feasibly integrated into ongoing clinical interventions during the pandemic. Routine, proactive clinical and research team communication that transparently addresses ethical tensions and health-sustaining activities may promote well-being for providers grappling with rapidly evolving pandemic directives. Proactive assessments of individual provider vulnerabilities for severe COVID-19 related respiratory illness may also be a crucial element of the health care system pandemic responses.","Moloney, Kathleen; Scheuer, Hannah; Engstrom, Allison; Schreiber, Merritt; Whiteside, Lauren; Nehra, Deepika; Walen, Mary Lou; Rivara, Frederick; Zatzick, Douglas",Psychiatry,62,16

Host whole blood transcriptomics can offer unique insights into the biological processes underpinning infection and disease, as well as severity. We performed whole blood RNA Sequencing of individuals with varying degrees of COVID-19 severity. We used differential expression analysis and pathway enrichment analysis to explore how the blood transcriptome differs between individuals with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19, performing pairwise comparisons between groups. Increasing COVID-19 severity was characterised by an abundance of inflammatory immune response genes and pathways, including many related to neutrophils and macrophages, in addition to an upregulation of immunoglobulin genes. Our insights into COVID-19 severity reveal the role of immune dysregulation in the progression to severe disease and highlight the need for further research exploring the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the inflammatory immune response.","Jackson, Heather; Calle, Irene Rivero; Broderick, Claire; Habgood-Coote, Dominic; D'Souza, Giselle; Nichols, Samuel; Rial, Jose Gómez; Rivero-Velasco, Carmen; Rodríguez-Núñez, Nuria; Barbeito-Castiñeiras, Gema; Pérez-Freixo, Hugo; Acosta, Manuel Barreiro-de; Cunnington, Aubrey; Herberg, Jethro; Wright, Victoria; Gómez-Carballa, Alberto; Salas, Antonio; Levin, Michael; Martinon-Torres, Federico; Kaforou, Myrsini; consortium, - PERFORM; group, - GEN-COVID study",,62,24

AIM OF STUDY: In the clinical studies, FFYH was very effective for the treatment of influenza, but the mechanism of action against influenza A virus remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the antiviral effect of FFYH against influenza A virus in vitro and vivo. Moreover, the potential mechanism of FFYH against influenza A virus in vivo was investigated for the first time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CPE inhibition assay and HA assay were used to evaluate the in vitro antiviral effects of FFYH against influenza A virus H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2. Mice were used to evaluate the antiviral effect of FFYH in vivo with ribavirin and lianhuaqingwen as positive controls. RT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA transcription of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IFN-Î³, IP10, and IL-1ß mRNA. ELISA was used to examine the expression of inflammatory factors such as TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IFN-Î³, IP10, and IL-1ß in sera. The blood parameters were analyzed with auto hematology analyzer. Moreover, the potential mechanism of FFYH against influenza A virus in vivo was also investigated. RESULTS: FFYH showed a broad-spectrum of antiviral activity against H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 influenza A viruses. Furthermore, FFYH dose-dependently increased the survival rate, significantly prolonged the median survival time of mice, and markedly reduced lung injury caused by influenza A virus. Also, FFYH significantly improve the sick signs, food taken, weight loss, blood parameters, lung index, and lung pathological changes. Moreover, FFYH could markedly inhibit the inflammatory cytokine expression of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IFN-Î³, IP10, IL-10, and IL-1ß mRNA or protein via inhibition of the TLR7/MyD88/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway in vivo. CONCLUSION: FFYH not only showed a broad-spectrum of anti-influenza virus activity in vitro, but also exhibited a significant protective effect against lethal influenza virus infection in vivo. Furthermore, our results indicated that the in vivo antiviral effect of FFYH against influenza virus may be attributed to suppressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines via regulating the TLR7/MyD88/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway. These findings provide evidence for the clinical treatment of influenza A virus infection with FFYH.","Zhang, Yuqian; Wang, Ronghua; Shi, Weiqing; Zheng, Zhihui; Wang, Xiaoquan; Li, Cheng; Zhang, Shuofeng; Zhang, Pinghu",J Ethnopharmacol,62,24

There are also concerns that the pandemic has affected supply and demand of acute cardiovascular care. We estimated excess mortality in specific CVDs, both 'direct', through infection, and 'indirect', through changes in healthcare. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used (i) national mortality data for England and Wales to investigate trends in non-COVID-19 and CVD excess deaths; (ii) routine data from hospitals in England (n = 2), Italy (n = 1), and China (n = 5) to assess indirect pandemic effects on referral, diagnosis, and treatment services for CVD; and (iii) population-based electronic health records from 3 862 012 individuals in England to investigate pre- and post-COVID-19 mortality for people with incident and prevalent CVD. We incorporated pre-COVID-19 risk (by age, sex, and comorbidities), estimated population COVID-19 prevalence, and estimated relative risk (RR) of mortality in those with CVD and COVID-19 compared with CVD and non-infected (RR: 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0).Mortality data suggest indirect effects on CVD will be delayed rather than contemporaneous (peak RR 1.14). CVD service activity decreased by 60-100% compared with pre-pandemic levels in eight hospitals across China, Italy, and England. In China, activity remained below pre-COVID-19 levels for 2-3 months even after easing lockdown and is still reduced in Italy and England. For total CVD (incident and prevalent), at 10% COVID-19 prevalence, we estimated direct impact of 31 205 and 62 410 excess deaths in England (RR 1.5 and 2.0, respectively), and indirect effect of 49 932 to 99 865 deaths. CONCLUSION: Supply and demand for CVD services have dramatically reduced across countries with potential for substantial, but avoidable, excess mortality during and after the pandemic.","Banerjee, Amitava; Chen, Suliang; Pasea, Laura; Lai, Alvina G; Katsoulis, Michail; Denaxas, Spiros; Nafilyan, Vahe; Williams, Bryan; Wong, Wai Keong; Bakhai, Ameet; Khunti, Kamlesh; Pillay, Deenan; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Wu, Honghan; Pareek, Nilesh; Bromage, Daniel; McDonagh, Theresa A; Byrne, Jonathan; Teo, James T H; Shah, Ajay M; Humberstone, Ben; Tang, Liang V; Shah, Anoop S V; Rubboli, Andrea; Guo, Yutao; Hu, Yu; Sudlow, Cathie L M; Lip, Gregory Y H; Hemingway, Harry",,62,1

In particular, thromboembolic complications have emerged as a key threat for patients with COVID-19. We assessed our experience with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with COVID-19 who had undergone upper or lower extremity venous duplex ultrasonography at an academic health system in New York City from March 3, 2020 to April 12, 2020 with follow-up through May 12, 2020. A cohort of hospitalized patients without COVID-19 (non-COVID-19) who had undergone venous duplex ultrasonography from December 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 was used for comparison. The primary outcome was DVT. The secondary outcomes included pulmonary embolism, in-hospital mortality, admission to the intensive care unit, and antithrombotic therapy. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify the risk factors for DVT and mortality. RESULTS: Of 443 patients (COVID-19, n = 188; and non-COVID-19, n = 255) who had undergone venous duplex ultrasonography, the COVID-19 cohort had had a greater incidence of DVT (31% vs 19%; P = .005) than had the non-COVID-19 cohort. The incidence of pulmonary embolism was not significantly different statistically between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cohorts (8% vs 4%; P = .105). The DVT location in the COVID-19 group was more often distal (63% vs 29%; P < .001) and bilateral (15% vs 4%; P < .001). The duplex ultrasound findings had a significant impact on the antithrombotic plan; 42 patients (72%) with COVID-19 in the DVT group had their therapy escalated and 49 (38%) and 3 (2%) had their therapy escalated and deescalated in the non-DVT group, respectively (P < .001). Within the COVID-19 cohort, the D-dimer level was significantly greater in the DVT group at admission (2746 ng/mL vs 1481 ng/mL; P = .004) and at the duplex examination (6068 ng/mL vs 3049 ng/mL; P < .01). On multivariable analysis, male sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-4.87; P = .035), intensive care unit admission (OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.02-11.44; P = .046), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.01-30.13; P = .049) were independently associated with DVT. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high incidence of venous thromboembolic events in this population, we support the decision to empirically initiate therapeutic anticoagulation for patients with a low bleeding risk and severe COVID-19 infection. Duplex ultrasonography should be reserved for patients with a high clinical suspicion of venous thromboembolism for whom anticoagulation therapy could result in life-threatening consequences.

We sought to study all possible complications of COVID-19 to confirm previously reported complications and to identify potential complications not yet known. METHODS: Using United States health claims data, we compared the frequency of all International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes occurring before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in an exposure-crossover design. We included patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 between Mar. 1, 2020, and Apr. 30, 2020, and computed risk estimates and odds ratios (ORs) of association with COVID-19 for every ICD-10-CM diagnosis code. RESULTS: Among 70 288 patients with COVID-19, 69 of 1724 analyzed ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes were significantly associated with COVID-19. Disorders showing both strong association with COVID-19 and high absolute risk included viral pneumonia (OR 177.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 147.19-214.37, absolute risk 27.6%), respiratory failure (OR 11.36, 95% CI 10.74-12.02, absolute risk 22.6%), acute kidney failure (OR 3.50, 95% CI 3.34-3.68, absolute risk 11.8%) and sepsis (OR 4.23, 95% CI 4.01-4.46, absolute risk 10.4%). Disorders showing strong associations with COVID-19 but low absolute risk included myocarditis (OR 8.17, 95% CI 3.58-18.62, absolute risk 0.1%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (OR 11.83, 95% CI 5.26-26.62, absolute risk 0.1%) and pneumothorax (OR 3.38, 95% CI 2.68-4.26, absolute risk 0.4%). INTERPRETATION: We confirmed and provided risk estimates for numerous complications of COVID-19.

In April 2020, an increasing number of asylum seekers at a reception centre in Espoo, Finland presented with COVID-19 despite earlier implementation of preventive measures. We decided to screen the entire population of the centre for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We offered nasopharyngeal swab collection and SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to the centre's clients. Symptoms were recorded at the time of diagnostic sample collection using electronic forms and followed up for two weeks through phone interviews and a review of medical records. Findings: 260 clients were screened. Of them, 96 (37%) were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 and isolated. The high attack rate prompted the local public health authority to set the other clients in quarantine for 14 days to prevent further spread. Of the positive cases, 61 (64%) reported having had symptoms at the time of the screening or one week prior. Of the 35 initially asymptomatic individuals, 12 developed symptoms during follow-up, while 23 (or 18% of all screened SARS-CoV-2 positive clients) remained asymptomatic. No widespread transmission of COVID-19 was detected after the quarantine was lifted. Interpretation: In this large COVID-19 outbreak, voluntary mass screening provided valuable information about its extent and helped guide the public health response. Comprehensive quarantine and isolation measures were likely instrumental in containing the outbreak.

Since its emergence, the COVID-19 pandemic has not only distressed medical services but also caused economic upheavals, marking urgent the need for effective therapeutics. The experience of combating SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has shown that inhibiting the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) blocks the replication of the virus. Given the well-studied properties of FDA-approved drugs, identification of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors in an FDA-approved drug library would be of great therapeutic value. Here, we screened a library consisting of 774 FDA-approved drugs for potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors, using an intramolecularly quenched fluorescence (IQF) peptide substrate. Ethacrynic acid, naproxen, allopurinol, butenafine hydrochloride, raloxifene hydrochloride, tranylcypromine hydrochloride, and saquinavir mesylate have been found to block the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The inhibitory activity of these repurposing drugs against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro highlights their therapeutic potential for treating COVID-19 and other Betacoronavirus infections.","Chiou, Wei-Chung; Hsu, Meng-Shiuan; Chen, Yun-Ti; Yang, Jinn-Moon; Tsay, Yeou-Guang; Huang, Hsiu-Chen; Huang, Cheng",J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,62,24

We felt this was a unique case as some cases of psoriatic arthropathy and reactive arthropathy but none, to our knowledge of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. CASE PRESENTATION: Twenty one-year-old female presented in June 2020 with inflammatory symptoms with general work-up per primary care provider being negative. Upon further work-up per Rheumatology, felt to have inflammatory back pain with X-rays of SI joints showing grade II sclerosis. Further work-up including magnetic resonance imaging was positive demonstrating bone edema and erosions of SI joint.

SARS-CoV-2 semiquanitative antibodies where done that where high positive. She was treated with cetrolizumab and had prompt improvement over the course of the next week. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 triggering autoimmunity is still unknown at this time. However, it is important that insights be gained into the type of disease that can be triggered by this infection. As the pandemic continues to rage on, Rheumatologist need to be increasing aware that patients presenting with various forms of inflammatory arthritis may be triggered by an antecedent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following these cases may help to determine how they differ from other forms of inflammatory arthropathy.","Saikali, Wassim; Gharib, Suzanne",Immun. Inflamm. Dis,62,16

We determined the proportion of screening and surveillance colonoscopies appropriate for rescheduling to a future year through strict adoption of US Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a single-center observational study of patients scheduled for ""open-access colonoscopy""-ordered by a primary care provider without being seen in gastroenterology clinic-over a 6-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each chart was reviewed to appropriately assign a surveillance year per USMSTF guidelines including demographics, colonoscopy history and family history. When guidelines recommended a range of colonoscopy intervals, both a ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" guideline adherence were assessed. RESULTS: We delayed 769 ""open-access"" screening or surveillance colonoscopies due to COVID-19. Between 14.8% (conservative) and 20.7% (liberal), colonoscopies were appropriate for rescheduling to a future year. Conversely, 415 (54.0%) patients were overdue for colonoscopy. Family history of CRC was associated with being scheduled too early for both screening (OR 3.9; CI 1.9-8.2) and surveillance colonoscopy (OR 2.6, CI 1.0-6.5). The most common reasons a colonoscopy was inappropriately scheduled this year were failure to use new surveillance colonoscopy intervals (28.9%), incorrectly applied family history guidelines (27.2%) and recommending early surveillance colonoscopy after recent normal colonoscopy (19.3%). CONCLUSION: Up to one-fifth of patients scheduled for ""open-access"" colonoscopy can be rescheduled into a future year based on USMSTF guidelines. Rigorously applying guidelines could judiciously allocate colonoscopy resources as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Xiao, Alexander Hua; Chang, Stephen Y; Stevoff, Christian G; Komanduri, Srinadh; Pandolfino, John E; Keswani, Rajesh N",Dig. dis. sci,62,16

The purpose of this brief report was to describe the feasibility of and satisfaction with telerehabilitation. A total of 205 participants completed online surveys after a telerehabilitation visit. Most commonly, participants were women (53.7%), 35-64 yrs old, and completed physical therapy (53.7%) for established visits of 30-44 mins in duration for primary impairments in sports, lower limb injuries, and pediatric neurology. Overall, high ratings (""excellent"" or ""very good"" responses) were observed for all patient-centered outcome metrics (range, 93.7%-99%) and value in future telehealth visit (86.8%) across telerehabilitation visits. Women participated more frequently and provided higher ratings than male participants did. Other benefits included eliminating travel time, incorporating other health care advocates, and convenience delivering care in familiar environment to pediatric patients.

AIMS: To evaluate the association between mental disorders and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes following COVID-19. METHOD: We performed a cohort study using the Korean COVID-19 patient database based on national health insurance data. Each person with a mental or behavioural disorder (diagnosed during the 6 months prior to their first SARS-CoV-2 test) was matched by age, gender and Charlson Comorbidity Index with up to four people without mental disorders. SARS-CoV-2-positivity risk and the risk of death or severe events (intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory distress syndrome) post-infection were calculated using conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Among 230 565 people tested for SARS-CoV-2, 33 653 (14.6%) had mental disorders; 928/33 653 (2.76%) tested SARS-CoV-2 positive and 56/928 (6.03%) died. In multivariable analysis using the matched cohort, there was no association between mental disorders and SARS-CoV-2-positivity risk (odds ratio OR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.87-1.04); however, a higher risk was associated with schizophrenia-related disorders (OR = 1.50; 95% CI 1.14-1.99). Among confirmed COVID-19 patients, the mortality risk was significantly higher in patients with than in those without mental disorders (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.15-3.43). CONCLUSIONS: Mental disorders are likely contributing factors to mortality following COVID-19. Although the infection risk was not higher for people with mental disorders overall, those with schizophrenia-related disorders were more vulnerable to infection.","Jeon, Ha-Lim; Kwon, Jun Soo; Park, So-Hee; Shin, Ju-Young",Br J Psychiatry,62,22

Methods: We first sought to estimate the vertical transmission rate of congenital CMV infection in twins by gathering cohort-based studies of congenital CMV in which vertical transmission in both singleton and twin pregnancies was reported. This also allowed us to compare singleton and twin infection rates. From the above studies and other large cohorts of congenitally infected infants, the percentage of discordantly infected twin pairs determined whether this is a rare phenomenon. Theorizing discordance is not rare, we then analyzed data from cases with twin outcomes for congenital CMV infection, according to whether the twins were monozygotic or dizygotic, and calculated their corresponding concordance rates to estimate the broad-sense heritability. Lastly, we described other factors that might affect vertical transmission. Results: From five articles following at-risk pregnancies, the rate of vertical transmission in twin pregnancies is 58.7% (95% CI 43.3-72.3%) whereas in singleton pregnancies it is 31.4% (95% CI: 29.0-34.0%) p = 0.0002. Of ten studies of larger cohorts of infants with congenital CMV infection, 21 of 42 twin pairs with at least one twin infected were discordant for congenital CMV (50.0%, 95% CI: 34.4-65.6%) indicating discordance of congenital CMV infection in twin pairs is not rare. Of 28 studies covering 37 twin pairs where at least one twin had congenital CMV, and zygosity was known, eleven of thirteen monozygotic twin pairs (84.6%; 95% CI: 53.7-97.3%) were concordant for CMV infection, and nine of twenty-four dizygotic twin pairs (37.5%; 95% CI: 19.6-59.2%) were concordant for infection giving an estimated hereditability of 94.2%. Within these 37 twin pairs, factors such as primary or recurrent maternal infection, prematurity, growth discordance, and sex are described; however, in many of these cases these factors are unknown. Conclusion: The rate of vertical transmission of congenital CMV is higher for twins than singletons. Discordance of congenital CMV in twins is not rare and suggests a possible genetic susceptibility to congenital CMV.","Hutton, Jill; Rowan, Paul J",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,62,29

Because of this outbreak, Okanogan County Public Health and the Washington State Department of Health initiated one-time, on-site screening testing (2) of all orchard and warehouse employees in August 2020 and assessed risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 3,708 known orchard employees, a valid SARS-CoV-2 test result or information on COVID-19-like symptoms in the absence of a test was available for 3,013 (81%). Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during approximately 3 months among tested orchard employees was 6%. Cumulative incidence was 12% in employees residing in the community, compared with 4% in employees residing in farmworker housing (p<0.001); point prevalence during the single screening testing event was 1% in both groups. Among 1,247 known warehouse employees, a valid result was available for 726 (58%). Cumulative incidence over approximately 3 months among tested warehouse employees was 23%, with substantial variation across job roles.

The susceptibility of patients with asthma to develop an exacerbation when they are infected with SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. We aimed to investigate the symptoms presented in patients with asthma who became infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients over 14 years of age who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (by RT-PCR) were included (n = 2995). In patients with asthma (n = 77, 2.6%; 44 females), symptoms, therapy and phenotype were recorded. Seventeen (22%) patients had mild asthma, 55 (71%) moderate and five severe (6%). Twenty-six patients with asthma (34%) were asymptomatic, 34 (44%) developed symptoms but did not require hospital admission, and 17 (22%) were hospitalised. One patient was admitted because of asthma exacerbation without pneumonia or other symptoms. Ten patients (13%) had wheezes (six with pneumonia). Comparison of wheezing between patients with non-T2 asthma and the rest of the patients was statistically significant, (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection is not a significant cause of asthma exacerbation, although some patients may present wheezing, especially in cases of pneumonia.

The option of school closure, SARS-CoV-2 initially being poorly known, was influenced by the epidemiological aspects of the influenza virus. However, school closure is still under debate and seems unsupported by sure evidence of efficacy in the COVID-19 era. The aim of our narrative review is to discuss the available literature on SARS-CoV-2 spread among children and adolescents, in the school setting, trying to explain why children appear less susceptible to severe disease and less involved in viral spreading. We also tried to define the efficacy of school closure, through an overview of the effects of the choices made by the various countries, trying to identify which preventive measures could be effective for a safe reopening. Finally, we focused on the psychological aspects of such a prolonged closure for children and adolescents. SARS-CoV-2, children, COVID-19, influenza, and school were used as key words in our literature research, updated to 29 March 2021. To our knowledge, this is the first review summarizing the whole current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 spreading among children and adolescents in the school setting, providing a worldwide overview in such a pandemic context.","Busa, Francesco Bardanzellu Flaminia Pintus Maria Cristina Fanos Vassilios Marcialis Maria Antonietta",Pediatric Reports,62,11

The presence of potential pathogens however, does not prove a causal relationship with diarrhoea. The aim of this study was to identify specific enteropathogens in ≤12 month old puppies with and without acute diarrhoea and to assess their associations with clinical signs, putative risk factors and pathogen co-occurrence. Faecal samples from puppies with (n = 113) and without (n = 56) acute diarrhoea were collected and screened for Canine Parvovirus (CPV), Canine Coronavirus (CCoV), Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, β-hemolytic Eschericha coli (hEC), Giardia spp., Toxocara spp., Cystoisospora spp., and Cyniclomyces guttulatus. One or more pathogens were detected in 86.5% of diarrhoeic puppies and in 77.8% of asymptomatic puppies. Significant positive associations were found between CPV and CCoV, CPV and Cystoisospora spp., Toxocara spp. and hEC, Giardia spp. and C. guttulatus. Only CPV and CCoV were significantly associated with diarrhoea, hEC with a subset of puppies that had diarrhoea and severe clinical signs. CPV was more prevalent in puppies under 3 months of age. Puppies from high-volume dog breeders were significantly at increased risk for CPV (OR 4.20), CCoV (OR 4.50) and Cystoisospora spp. (OR 3.60). CCoV occurred significantly more often in winter (OR 3.35), and CPV in winter (OR 3.78) and spring (OR 4.72) as compared to summer. We conclude that routine screening for CPV, CCoV and hEC is recommended in puppies with acute diarrhoea, especially if they are under 3 months of age and originate from high-volume dog breeders. Routine screening for other pathogens may lead to less conclusive results.","Duijvestijn, Mirjam; Mughini-Gras, Lapo; Schuurman, Nancy; Schijf, Wim; Wagenaar, Jaap A.; Egberink, Herman",Vet Microbiol,62,20

Probiotics, prebiotics or their combination (synbiotics) are a way of modifying the intestinal microbiota and exert effects on the host immune response. Probiotics are proposed to exert their beneficial effects through various pathways, for example production of antimicrobial peptides, enhancing growth of favourable endogenous microorganisms, competition for epithelial colonisation sites and immune‐modulatory functions. Despite widespread use of pro‐, pre‐ and synbiotics, scientific evidence of their beneficial effects in different conditions of the dog is scarce. Specific effects of different strains, their combination or their potential side‐effects have not been evaluated sufficiently. In some instances, in vitro results have been promising, but could not be transferred consistently into in vivo situations. Specific canine gastrointestinal (GI) diseases or conditions where probiotics would be beneficial, their most appropriate dosage and application have not been assessed extensively. This review summarises the current knowledge of the intestinal microbiome composition in the dog and evaluates the evidence for probiotic use in canine GI diseases to date. It wishes to provide veterinarians with evidence‐based information on when and why these products could be useful in preventing or treating canine GI conditions.

Ethiopia has become one of the affected countries as of March 15, 2020. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the knowledge, perceptions, and practices among the Jimma University medical center (JUMC) visitors in Jimma town. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 247 sampled visitors, from 20–24 March 2020. Consecutive sampling was used to recruit the participants. The study tools were adapted from WHO resources. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the status of knowledge, perception, and practices. Logistic regression was executed to assess the predictors of dominant preventive practices. RESULTS: Of the 247 respondents, 205 (83.0%) knew the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19. 72.0% knew that older people who have chronic illnesses are at high risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19. About 95.1% knew that the COVID-19 virus spreads via respiratory droplets of infected people, while 77 (31.2%) of the respondents knew about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission. Only 15 (6.1%) knew that children and young adults had to involve preventive measures. Overall, 41.3% of the visitors had high knowledge. The majority, 170(68.8%), felt self-efficacious to controlling COVID-19. 207(83.3%) believed that COVID-19 is a stigmatized disease. Frequent hand washing (77.3%) and avoidance of shaking hands (53.8%) were the dominant practices. Knowledge status and self-efficacy (positively), older age, and unemployment (negatively) predicted hand washing and avoidance of handshaking. CONCLUSIONS: The status of knowledge and desirable practices were not sufficient enough to combat this rapidly spreading virus. COVID-19 risk communication and public education efforts should focus on building an appropriate level of knowledge while enhancing the adoption of recommended self-care practices with special emphasis on high-risk audience segments.","Kebede, Yohannes; Yitayih, Yimenu; Birhanu, Zewdie; Mekonen, Seblework; Ambelu, Argaw",PLoS One,62,26

The use of non-renewable fossil fuels threatens earth’s environment. At the same time, waste from agricultural and industrial activities is increasing. Most of this waste is discarded or poorly managed, causing many other environmental issues. Converting waste to energy is a promising route to address these challenges. We investigated the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of high moisture content, tobacco-processing waste in a multiple batch thermal reactor to produce biocrude oil. The effects of operating conditions were studied and optimized for maximum liquid biocrude oil yield. HTL operating conditions considered were temperatures from 280 to 340 °C and residence times from 15 to 45 min for a fixed ratio of biomass to deionized water of 1:3. The reaction temperature was found to affect the yields and distribution of products significantly. The maximum yield of the liquid biocrude oil obtained was more than 52% w/w at 310 °C and 15 min. Under these conditions, almost 90% of the energy was recovered in biocrude oil and solid products. The liquid fraction was mainly composed of phenols, ketones, and nitrogenous compounds. This study provides a potential framework for eco-technologies for biomass waste-to-energy conversion with respect to converting tobacco processing residues to liquid biofuels and biochemicals.

Data have suggested that romantic partners can improve long-term exercise adherence and that this dyadic approach should be examined in exercise interventions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to conduct a qualitative evaluation of a pilot exercise intervention conducted in older AA couples. METHODS: Two semi-structured focus groups were utilized to compare participants’ perceptions of and experiences during the pilot intervention across two randomly assigned treatment conditions (exercising together with partner [ET; n = 8] versus exercising separately [ES: n = 6]). Participants (mean age: 64.7 ± 6.8 years) of a previous 12-week pilot exercise intervention (walking ≥3 days/week, 30 min/day plus supervised resistance training 2 days/week) were interviewed. Verbatim transcripts were coded using an open coding approach. RESULTS: Three key themes (intervention value/benefits, intervention difficulties, and suggested improvements) emerged. Although all couples identified health and relationship benefits of the intervention, some differences surfaced within themes across the two intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these qualitative data suggest that couples had a positive experience while participating in the pilot study. In addition, key learning points to improve the intervention were identified including a more gradual transition to independent exercise, more flexibility training, and the incorporation of tangential education. These data will help investigators continue to develop the intervention, which is ultimately designed to promote long-term exercise adherence to reduce cardiometabolic health disparities in the AA community.","Hornbuckle, Lyndsey M.; Barroso, Cristina S.; Rauer, Amy; Jones, Chloe S.; Winters-Stone, Kerri M.",BMC Public Health,62,33

METHODS: We used a multi-stage, mixed methods approach to developing the DBS. First, the research team identified twenty-eight candidate items through a review of the literature and 117 qualitative narratives from adults living with T1D. Next, items were revised based on the expert (n = 20) and individual with T1D (n = 10) feedback. The resulting 18-item DBS measure along with validated measures of diabetes distress, depressive symptoms, and questions related to diabetes outcomes (i.e., last reported hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] and Time-in-Range [TiR]) were completed by 1099 adults with T1D across the U.S. The sample was randomly divided into two subsets (n1 = 561, n2 = 538) for exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA/CFA) to determine the underlying structure of the DBS. Regression analyses examined the relationships of the DBS with self-reported glycemic control and socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Based on the EFA three factors are identified and the DBS demonstrated strong internal consistency with Cronbach alphas (≥0.80). The validation and confirmatory analysis for the structure of the DBS provided consistent results with EFA. Higher burnout (overall DBS) was positively associated with diabetes distress (b = 0.74; p < 0.01) and depressive symptoms (b = 0.61; p < 0.01). Overall DBS, however was the strongest predictor for poorer HbA1c (r2 = 0.19; p < 0.01) and lower TiR (r2 = 0.17; p < 0.01) compared to diabetes distress and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: The 12-item DBS is a reliable and valid scale to measure diabetes burnout in adults with diabetes. The results provide a weak to strong degree of association between the validated DBS scale, T1-DDS and PHQ-8. The DBS can contribute to advancement of diabetes science by measuring diabetes burnout and informing clinical interventions to improve psychosocial care in individuals with diabetes.","Abdoli, Samereh; Miller-Bains, Katherine; Fanti, Paulo; Silveira, Monica S.V.M.; Hessler, Danielle",J Clin Transl Endocrinol,62,21

The organization of dialysis units to treat chronic HD patients with COVID-19 is demanding to prevent virus transmission both in COVID-free patients and the staff. These constraints may have an impact on the dialysis delivery to COVID-free HD patients. We report our experience in French NephroCare (NC) centers. METHODS: We report retrospectively dialysis and nutritional indicators among COVID-free prevalent chronic HD patients' cohort treated in French NC units from February 2020 to April 2020. The COVID-free HD patients were split into 2 subgroups for the analysis, Paris region and other regions because the incidence of COVID-19 was different according to the French regions. RESULTS: The Paris region was the most impacted by COVID-19 with 73% of all the contaminations that occurred in French NC units (n = 118). The dialysis frequency was not reduced all over the NC regions. 2,110 COVID-free HD patients were split into 2 subgroups including Paris region (748 patients) and other regions (1,362 patients). The weekly treatment time decreased significantly in Paris region from February to April (723–696 min [p < 0.00001]) but remained stable in the other regions. The processed blood volume, KT/V, and convective volume declined significantly in the Paris region subgroup but not in other regions. The 3-month weight loss significantly increased in the whole group of patients whatever the region from 0.0 to 0.2% between February 2020 and April 2020 (p < 0.00001). Ultrafiltration rate (UFR) and the normalized proteic catabolic rate remained stable all along the period. The stepwise regression analysis identified February serum albumin level and April UFR as negatively associated with 3-month weight loss. CONCLUSION: HD delivery to COVID-free HD patients was negatively impacted in the Paris region because of the strong constraints on units' organization related to the treatment of COVID-19+ HD patients and with a higher proportion of limited care/self-care units with less staff resources. The 3-month weight loss increase may be related to the suppression of intradialytic snack that impacted mostly the more malnourished patients or patients with lower interdialytic weight gain. These consequences of the COVID-19 crisis on COVID-free HD patients must be recognized and corrected to prevent further deleterious effects on patients' outcomes.","Chazot, Charles; Weis, Lise; Hebibi, Hadia; Jean, Guillaume; Deleuze, Sebastien; Levannier, Martial; Attaf, David; Stuard, Stefano",Blood Purif,62,16

The impact of the pandemic is inevitably not limited to patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and their outcomes; however, the impact of COVID-19 on intensive care has not yet been analyzed. METHODS: The objective of this propensity score-matched study was to compare the clinical outcomes of non-COVID-19 critically ill patients with the outcomes of prepandemic patients. Critically ill, non-COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) during the first wave of the pandemic were matched with patients admitted in the previous year. Mortality, length of stay, and rate of readmission were compared between the two groups after matching. RESULTS: A total of 211 critically ill SARS-CoV‑2 negative patients admitted between 13 March 2020 and 16 May 2020 were matched to 211 controls, selected from a matching pool of 1421 eligible patients admitted to the ICU in 2019. After matching, the outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups: ICU mortality was 5.2% in 2019 and 8.5% in 2020, p = 0.248, while intrahospital mortality was 10.9% in 2019 and 14.2% in 2020, p = 0.378. The median ICU length of stay was similar in 2019: 4 days (IQR 2–6) compared to 2020: 4 days (IQR 2–7), p = 0.196. The rate of ICU readmission was 15.6% in 2019 and 10.9% in 2020, p = 0.344. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective single center study, mortality, ICU length of stay, and rate of ICU readmission did not differ significantly between patients admitted to the ICU during the implementation of hospital-wide COVID-19 contingency planning and patients admitted to the ICU before the pandemic.","Bologheanu, Răzvan; Maleczek, Mathias; Laxar, Daniel; Kimberger, Oliver",Wien Klin Wochenschr,62,1

While CRPMs are gaining in popularity, they have yet to be widely adopted in clinical practice. The lack of explainability and interpretability has limited their utility. Explainability is the extent of which a model’s prediction process can be described. Interpretability is the degree to which a user can understand the predictions made by a model. METHODS: The study aimed to demonstrate utility of patient similarity analytics in developing an explainable and interpretable CRPM. Data was extracted from the electronic medical records of patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidaemia in a Singapore public primary care clinic. We used modified K-nearest neighbour which incorporated expert input, to develop a patient similarity model on this real-world training dataset (n = 7,041) and validated it on a testing dataset (n = 3,018). The results were compared using logistic regression, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models from the same dataset. The patient similarity model was then implemented in a prototype system to demonstrate the identification, explainability and interpretability of similar patients and the prediction process. RESULTS: The patient similarity model (AUROC = 0.718) was comparable to the logistic regression (AUROC = 0.695), RF (AUROC = 0.764) and SVM models (AUROC = 0.766). We packaged the patient similarity model in a prototype web application. A proof of concept demonstrated how the application provided both quantitative and qualitative information, in the form of patient narratives. This information was used to better inform and influence clinical decision-making, such as getting a patient to agree to start insulin therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patient similarity analytics is a feasible approach to develop an explainable and interpretable CRPM. While the approach is generalizable, it can be used to develop locally relevant information, based on the database it searches. Ultimately, such an approach can generate a more informative CRPMs which can be deployed as part of clinical decision support tools to better facilitate shared decision-making in clinical practice.

The virus persistently infects the protozoan Leishmania. It possesses an icosahedral capsid of approximately 32–33nm in diameter. The double-stranded RNA genome of LRVs is approximately 5.3kbp in length and encodes two proteins – the capsid protein and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Its capsid protein has a unique endoribonuclease activity that targets the viral genome in a site-specific manner. The polymerase is expressed as a polyprotein that is processed by a host-encoded cysteine protease. This ancient virus has elaborated a variety of mechanisms to control copy number that has allowed it to co-evolve with its protozoan host.

Since both infections are endemic in North America, it was assumed as a working hypothesis that their geographic distributions were similar. Hence, the purpose of this exploratory analysis was to investigate the comparative geographical distribution of both viral infections. Counts of FIV (n=17,108) and FeLV (n=30,017) positive serology results (FIV antibody and FeLV ELISA) were obtained for 48 contiguous states and District of Columbia of the United States of America (US) from the IDEXX Laboratories website. The proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV infection was estimated for each administrative region and its geographic distribution pattern was visualized by a choropleth map. Statistical evidence of an excess in the proportional morbidity ratio from unity was assessed using the spatial scan test under the normal probability model. RESULTS: This study revealed distinct spatial distribution patterns in the proportional morbidity ratio suggesting the presence of one or more relevant and geographically varying risk factors. The disease map indicates that there is a higher prevalence of FIV infections in the southern and eastern US compared to FeLV. In contrast, FeLV infections were observed to be more frequent in the western US compared to FIV. The respective excess in proportional morbidity ratio was significant with respect to the spatial scan test (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The observed variability in the geographical distribution of the proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV may be related to the presence of an additional or unique, but yet unknown, spatial risk factor. Putative factors may be geographic variations in specific virus strains and rate of vaccination. Knowledge of these factors and the geographical distributions of these infections can inform recommendations for testing, management and prevention. However, further studies are required to investigate the potential association of these factors with FIV and FeLV.","Chhetri, Bimal K; Berke, Olaf; Pearl, David L; Bienzle, Dorothee",BMC Vet Res,62,1

One such antigen, the hemoglobin-digesting intestinal aspartic protease known as Na-APR-1 from the human hookworm Necator americanus, is currently a lead candidate antigen in clinical trials, as is Na-GST-1 a heme-detoxifying glutathione S-transferase. METHODS: In order to discover additional hookworm vaccine antigens, messenger RNA was obtained from the intestine of male hookworms, Ancylostoma ceylanicum, maintained in hamsters. RNA-seq was performed using Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. The genes expressed in the hookworm intestine were compared with those expressed in the whole worm and those genes overexpressed in the parasite intestine transcriptome were further analyzed. RESULTS: Among the lead transcripts identified were genes encoding for proteolytic enzymes including an A. ceylanicum APR-1, but the most common proteases were cysteine-, serine-, and metallo-proteases. Also in abundance were specific transporters of key breakdown metabolites, including amino acids, glucose, lipids, ions and water; detoxifying and heme-binding glutathione S-transferases; a family of cysteine-rich/antigen 5/pathogenesis-related 1 proteins (CAP) previously found in high abundance in parasitic nematodes; C-type lectins; and heat shock proteins. These candidates will be ranked for downstream antigen target selection based on key criteria including abundance, uniqueness in the parasite versus the vertebrate host, as well as solubility and yield of expression. CONCLUSION: The intestinal transcriptome of A. ceylanicum provides useful information for the identification of proteins involved in the blood-feeding process, representing a first step towards a reverse vaccinology approach to a human hookworm vaccine.

M1-like macrophages control intracellular bacterial pathogens and tumor progression. In contrast, M2-like macrophages shape reparative microenvironments that can be conducive for pathogen survival or tumor growth. An imbalance of these macrophages phenotypes may perpetuate sites of chronic unresolved inflammation, such as infectious granulomas and solid tumors. We have found that plant-derived and synthetic rocaglates sensitize macrophages to low concentrations of the M1-inducing cytokine IFN-gamma and inhibit their responsiveness to IL-4, a prototypical activator of the M2-like phenotype. Treatment of primary macrophages with rocaglates enhanced phagosome-lysosome fusion and control of intracellular mycobacteria. Thus, rocaglates represent a novel class of immunomodulators that can direct macrophage polarization toward the M1-like phenotype in complex microenvironments associated with hypofunction of type 1 and/or hyperactivation of type 2 immunity, e.g., chronic bacterial infections, allergies, and, possibly, certain tumors.","Chatterjee, Sujoy; Yabaji, Shivraj M.; Rukhlenko, Oleksii S.; Bhattacharya, Bidisha; Waligurski, Emily; Vallavoju, Nandini; Ray, Somak; Kholodenko, Boris N.; Brown, Lauren E.; Beeler, Aaron B.; Ivanov, Alexander R.; Kobzik, Lester; Porco, John A.; Kramnik, Igor",iScience,62,16

The PPIs range from the initial binding of viral coat proteins to host membrane receptors to the hijacking of host transcription machinery. However, few interspecies PPIs have been identified, because experimental methods including mass spectrometry are time-consuming and expensive, and molecular dynamic simulation is limited only to the proteins whose 3D structures are solved. Sequence-based machine learning methods are expected to overcome these problems. We have first developed the LSTM model with word2vec to predict PPIs between human and virus, named LSTM-PHV, by using amino acid sequences alone. The LSTM-PHV effectively learnt the training data with a highly imbalanced ratio of positive to negative samples and achieved AUCs of 0.976 and 0.973 and accuracies of 0.984 and 0.985 on the training and independent datasets, respectively. In predicting PPIs between human and unknown or new virus, the LSTM-PHV learned greatly outperformed the existing state-of-the-art PPI predictors. Interestingly, learning of only sequence contexts as words is sufficient for PPI prediction. Use of uniform manifold approximation and projection demonstrated that the LSTM-PHV clearly distinguished the positive PPI samples from the negative ones.

In the United States, policies on mask wearing have varied from state to state over the course of the pandemic. Even as more and more government leaders encourage or even mandate mask wearing, many citizens still resist the notion. Our research examines mask-wearing policy and adherence in association with COVID-19 case rates. We used state-level data on mask-wearing policy for the general public and on proportion of residents who stated they always wear masks in public. For all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), these data were abstracted by month for April[boxh]September 2020 to measure their impact on COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month (May[boxh]October 2020). Monthly COVID-19 case rates (number of cases per capita over two weeks) >200 per 100,000 residents were considered high. Fourteen of the 15 states with no mask-wearing policy for the general public reported a high COVID-19 rate. Of the 8 states with at least 75% mask adherence, none reported a high COVID-19 rate. States with the lowest levels of mask adherence were most likely to have high COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month, independent of mask policy or demographic factors. Our analysis suggests high adherence to mask wearing could be a key factor in reducing the spread of COVID-19.

Multiplex tiled PCR is a desirable approach for targeted genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater due to its low cost and rapid turnaround time. However, it is not clear how different multiplex tiled PCR primer schemes or wastewater sample matrices impact the resulting SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage. The objective of this work was to assess the performance of three different multiplex primer schemes, consisting of 150bp, 400bp, and 1200bp amplicons, as well as two wastewater sample matrices, influent wastewater and primary sludge, for targeted genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2. Wastewater samples were collected weekly from five municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the Metro Vancouver region of British Columbia, Canada during a period of increased COVID-19 case counts from February to April, 2021. RNA extracted from clarified influent wastewater provided significantly higher genome coverage (breadth and median depth) than primary sludge samples across all primer schemes. Shorter amplicons appeared more resilient to sample RNA degradation, but were hindered by greater primer pool complexity in the 150bp scheme. The identified optimal primer scheme (400bp) and sample matrix (influent) was capable of detecting the emergence of mutations associated with genomic variants of concern, of which the daily wastewater load significantly correlated with clinical case counts. Taken together, these results provide guidance on best practices for implementing wastewater-based genomic surveillance, and demonstrate its ability to inform epidemiology efforts by detecting genomic variants of concern circulating within a geographic region.","Lin, X.; Glier, M.; Kuchinski, K.; Ross-Van Mierlo, T.; McVea, D.; Tyson, J.

It involves genetic and lifestyle factors that lead to dysregulations in hormone secretion and metabolic homeostasis. Accumulating evidence indicates that altered mitochondrial structure, function, and particularly bioenergetics of cells in different tissues have a central role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the present study, we explore how mitochondrial dysfunction impairs the coupling between metabolism and exocytosis in the pancreatic alpha and beta cells. We demonstrate that reduced mitochondrial ATP production is linked with the observed defects in insulin and glucagon secretion by utilizing computational modeling approach. Specifically, a 30–40% reduction in alpha cells’ mitochondrial function leads to a pathological shift of glucagon secretion, characterized by oversecretion at high glucose concentrations and insufficient secretion in hypoglycemia. In beta cells, the impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism is accompanied by reduced insulin secretion at all glucose levels, but the differences, compared to a normal beta cell, are the most pronounced in hyperglycemia. These findings improve our understanding of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial bioenergetics in the pathology of type 2 diabetes mellitus and might help drive the development of innovative therapies to treat various metabolic diseases.","Grubelnik, Vladimir; Zmazek, Jan; Markovič, Rene; Gosak, Marko; Marhl, Marko",Life (Basel),62,1

They include New Delhi metallo-ß-lactamase (NDM)-producing carbapenemase (50.4% of all species in Ontario). Antibiotic challenges for resistant bacteria in neonates pose challenges of unknown dosing and side effects. We report two antenatally diagnosed CP-CRE colonization scenarios with the NDM 1 gene. The case involves extreme preterm twins who had worsening respiratory distress at birth requiring ventilator support, with the first twin also having cardiovascular instability. They were screened for CP-CRE, and a polymyxin antibiotic commenced. In the delivery room, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the follow-up clinic, in collaboration with the interdisciplinary group, contact precautions and isolation procedures were instituted. None of the infants exhibited infection with CP-CRE. Consolidating knowledge with regard to CP-CRE and modifying human behavior associated with its spread can mitigate potential negative consequences. This relates to now and later, when travel and prolific human to human contact resumes, from endemic countries, after the current COVID-19 pandemic. Standardized efforts to curb the acquisition of this infection would be judicious given the challenges of treatment and continued emerging antibiotic resistance. Simple infection control measures involving contact precautions, staff education and parental cohorting can be useful and cost-effective in preventing transmission. Attention to NICU specific measures, including screening of at-risk mothers (invitro fertilization conception) and their probands, careful handling of breastmilk, judicious antibiotic choice and duration of treatment, is warranted. What does this study add? CP-CRE is a nosocomial infection with increasing incidence globally, and a serious threat to public health, making it likely that these cases will present with greater frequency to the NICU team.

Thus, it is not surprising that any damage to the gut microbiota is associated with disorders in different body systems. Probiotics, defined as living microorganisms with health benefits for the host, can support or restore the composition of the gut microbiota. Numerous investigations have proved a relationship between the gut microbiota with normal brain function as well as many brain diseases, in which cognitive dysfunction is a common clinical problem. On the other hand, increasing evidence suggests that the existence of a healthy gut microbiota is crucial for normal cognitive processing. In this regard, interplay of the gut microbiota and cognition has been under focus of recent researches.

We aimed to evaluate the association between adiposity and regression of prediabetes/diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS The San Juan Overweight Adults Longitudinal Study (SOALS) included 1351 individuals with overweight/obesity, aged 40-65, free of major cardiovascular diseases and physician diagnosed diabetes. From the 1012 participants with baseline prediabetes/diabetes, 598 who completed the follow-up were included. Over the follow-up, 25% regressed from prediabetes to normoglycemia or from diabetes to prediabetes or normoglycemia. Poisson regression with robust standard error was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) adjusting for major confounders. Higher neck circumference (NC) was associated with regression of prediabetes/diabetes (RR = 0.45 comparing extreme tertiles; 95% CI:0.30-0.66); RR was 0.49 (95% CI:0.34-0.73) for waist circumference (WC) and 0.64 (95% CI:0.44-0.92) for BMI. Significant associations were found using median cut-offs or continuous measures for weight and BMI. Greater reduction in BMI (comparing extreme tertiles) was significantly associated with regression of prediabetes/diabetes (RR = 1.44; 95% CI:1.02-2.02). Continuous measures of change in adiposity (except for NC) were also associated with regression of prediabetes/diabetes for BMI and weight. Participants who reduced BMI (>5%) increased prediabetes/diabetes regression (RR = 1.61; 95% CI:1.15-2.25) compared to those who did not; similarly for weight (RR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.10-2.19). Additional analysis for body fat percentage showing slightly weaker results than BMI/weight further supported our findings. CONCLUSION Lower baseline adiposity and higher reduction in adiposity were associated with regression of prediabetes/diabetes among individuals with overweight/obesity.","Modi, Ashwinkumar; Gadhavi, Rajendra; Pérez, Cynthia M; Joshipura, Kaumudi","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",62,24

The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in patients followed for rare autoimmune diseases as well as the predictors of COVID-19 and disease flare-ups. METHODS: Cross-sectional phone survey from April 9, 2020, to July 2, 2020, during which patients with autoimmune diseases followed at the National Reference Center for Rare Autoimmune diseases of Strasbourg were systematically contacted by phone and sent a prescription for a SARS-CoV-2 serology. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred thirty-two patients were contacted. One thousand fifty-five patients with a confirmed diagnosis of systemic autoimmune disease were included (4 unreachable, 4 moves abroad, 5 deaths before pandemic, 50 without consent, and 114 without autoimmune disease). Among them, 469 (44.5%) patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology. Thirty-nine patients (7.9%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection (either through chest CT-scan [n = 5], RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab [n = 14], or serology [n = 31]) among the 496 who underwent at least one of those 3 diagnosis modalities. Of the 39 proven cases, 33 had clinical manifestations (6 asymptomatic patients were diagnosed through systematic serology testing), 31 were managed by home care, 3 were hospitalized due to a need for oxygenation, two required admission to an intensive care unit, and one died. Among patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported flares were more frequent than in uninfected patients (26.3% [10/38] vs. 7.0% [32/457], p < 0.0001). Preventive sick leave had no significant impact on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (5.8% [3/53]) compared to work continuation (7.6% [30/397], p = 0.64). Overall, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.6% (31/469) which was numerically lower to the Grand-Est general population estimated to be 9.0%. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic survey of more than 1000 patients with rare systemic autoimmune diseases reports a low prevalence of proven SARS-CoV-2 infection and very rare severe infections, probably related to good compliance with prophylactic measures in these patients.

Native CRISPR-Cas systems exist in many bacteria and archaea where they provide an adaptive immune response through sequence-specific degradation of an invading pathogen’s genome. This system has been reconfigured for use in genome editing, drug development, gene expression regulation, diagnostics, the prevention and treatment of cancers, and the treatment of genetic and infectious diseases. In recent years, CRISPR-Cas systems have been used in the diagnosis and control of viral diseases, for example, CRISPR-Cas12/13 coupled with new amplification techniques to improve the specificity of sequence-specific fluorescent probe detection. Importantly, CRISPR applications are both sensitive and specific and usually only require commonly available lab equipment. Unlike the canonical Cas9 which is guided to double-stranded DNA sites of interest, Cas13 systems target RNA sequences and thus can be employed in strategies directed against RNA viruses or for transcriptional silencing. Many challenges remain for these approach, including issues with specificity and the requirement for better mammalian delivery systems. In this review, we summarize the applications of CRISPR-Cas systems in controlling mammalian viral infections. Following necessary improvements, it is expected that CRISPR-Cas systems will be used effectively for such applications in the future.","Ghorbani, Abozar; Hadifar, Shima; Salari, Roya; Izadpanah, Keramatollah; Burmistrz, Michal; Afsharifar, Alireza; Eskandari, Mohammad Hadi; Niazi, Ali; Denes, Christopher E.; Neely, G.

Although emergency departments (ED) see a high volume of patients with HRSN, ED providers have limited time to complete detailed assessments of patients’ HRSN and are not always able to provide up-to-date and comprehensive information to patients on available community resources. Electronic, geographically indexed resource database systems have the potential to provide an efficient way for emergency physicians to rapidly identify community resources in settings where immediate social work consultation is not accessible. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of papers examining the use of geographically indexed resource database systems in healthcare to better understand how these services can be used in emergency care. We then conducted simulated, standardized searches using two nationally available databases (211 and Aunt Bertha), applied to a single metropolitan area (Boston). RESULTS: Our systematic review found that most public health and screening interventions using nationally available databases have focused on chronic care needs. A small subset of publications demonstrated that these databases were mobilized during disasters to successfully aid vulnerable populations during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. A total of 408 standardized searches were conducted to identify community resources related to four domains of social needs (food, transportation, housing, and utilities). Although 99% of the resources identified by both databases were relevant to the search domains queried, a significant proportion of the resources identified by each database were restricted to a specific demographic (eg, veterans). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that geographically indexed referral databases may be an effective tool to help ED providers connect patients to nearby community resources during public health emergencies. We recommend that EDs select a referral database based on the greatest number of resources that are not demographically restricted.","Curt, Alexa; Khidir, Hazar; Ciccolo, Gia; Camargo, Carlos A.; Samuels-Kalow, Margaret",West J Emerg Med,62,30

There is very little data reported on the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 on this gruop of patients Methods Retrospective cohort study approved of all LTx recipients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 investigated with naso-pharyngeal swabs and reverse PCR for SARS-COV-2. Postive test for SARS-COV-2 Inserted to our cohort and investigated their files. We also conducted pooled analysis of published cases of covid 19 cases of lung transplant recipients Results We identified eleven cases of COVID-19 among a cohort of 348 LTx recipients. All but two patients were hospitalized. Seven patients required intensive care and six died (55% mortality). Non-survivors had lower baseline FEV1 than survivors and worse and/or deteriorating chest radiographic scores during admission. No effect of medical therapy including steroids and remdesivir could be determined. This mortality rate compared poorly general hospitalized COVID-19 patients at our institution (13%) and national mortality rate of 0.3% in the general population. Incidence of COVID-19 was similar to the general population (0.3%). In a pooled analysis of published cases, we determined mortality of 28% across different reports of lung transplant patients with COVID-19. Conclusion COVID-19 disease is very severe in lung transplant recipients. In the absence of effective therapy and vaccination, transplant physicians should concentrate their efforts on prevention of disease and encourage meticulous preventative behavior by recipients under their care.","Amor, S.

Building with Intention",19.619942,10.838752,2020-08-12,"BACKGROUND This review is one of a series of rapid reviews that Cochrane contributors have prepared to inform the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. When new respiratory infectious diseases become widespread, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers' adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines becomes even more important. Strategies in these guidelines include the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, face shields, gloves and gowns; the separation of patients with respiratory infections from others; and stricter cleaning routines. These strategies can be difficult and time-consuming to adhere to in practice. Authorities and healthcare facilities therefore need to consider how best to support healthcare workers to implement them. OBJECTIVES To identify barriers and facilitators to healthcare workers' adherence to IPC guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases. SEARCH METHODS We searched OVID MEDLINE on 26 March 2020. As we searched only one database due to time constraints, we also undertook a rigorous and comprehensive scoping exercise and search of the reference lists of key papers. We did not apply any date limit or language limits. SELECTION CRITERIA We included qualitative and mixed-methods studies (with a distinct qualitative component) that focused on the experiences and perceptions of healthcare workers towards factors that impact on their ability to adhere to IPC guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases. We included studies of any type of healthcare worker with responsibility for patient care. We included studies that focused on IPC guidelines (local, national or international) for respiratory infectious diseases in any healthcare setting. These selection criteria were framed by an understanding of the needs of health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Four review authors independently assessed the titles, abstracts and full texts identified by our search. We used a prespecified sampling frame to sample from the eligible studies, aiming to capture a range of respiratory infectious disease types, geographical spread and data-rich studies. We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this synthesis. We assessed methodological limitations using an adapted version of the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tool. We used a 'best fit framework approach' to analyse and synthesise the evidence. This provided upfront analytical categories, with scope for further thematic analysis. We used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each review finding to identify factors that may influence intervention implementation and developed implications for practice. MAIN RESULTS We found 36 relevant studies and sampled 20 of these studies for our analysis. Ten of these studies were from Asia, four from Africa, four from Central and North America and two from Australia. The studies explored the views and experiences of nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers when dealing with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), tuberculosis (TB), or seasonal influenza. Most of these healthcare workers worked in hospitals; others worked in primary and community care settings. Our review points to several barriers and facilitators that influenced healthcare workers' ability to adhere to IPC guidelines. The following factors are based on findings assessed as of moderate to high confidence. Healthcare workers felt unsure as to how to adhere to local guidelines when they were long and ambiguous or did not reflect national or international guidelines. They could feel overwhelmed because local guidelines were constantly changing. They also described how IPC strategies led to increased workloads and fatigue, for instance because they had to use PPE and take on additional cleaning. Healthcare workers described how their responses to IPC guidelines were influenced by the level of support they felt that they received from their management team. Clear communication about IPC guidelines was seen as vital. But healthcare workers pointed to a lack of training about the infection itself and about how to use PPE. They also thought it was a problem when training was not mandatory. Sufficient space to isolate patients was also seen as vital. A lack of isolation rooms, anterooms and shower facilities was a problem. Other important practical measures described by healthcare workers included minimising overcrowding, fast-tracking infected patients, restricting visitors, and providing easy access to handwashing facilities. A lack of PPE, and equipment that was of poor quality, was a serious concern for healthcare workers and managers. They also pointed to the need to adjust the volume of supplies as infection outbreaks continued. Healthcare workers believed that they followed IPC guidance more closely when they saw the value of it. Some healthcare workers felt motivated to follow the guidance because of fear of infecting themselves or their families, or because they felt responsible for their patients. Some healthcare workers found it difficult to use masks and other equipment when it made patients feel isolated, frightened or stigmatised. Healthcare workers also found masks and other equipment uncomfortable to use. The workplace culture could also influence whether healthcare workers followed IPC guidelines or not. Across many of the findings, healthcare workers pointed to the importance of including all staff, including cleaning staff, porters, kitchen staff and other support staff when implementing IPC guidelines. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Healthcare workers point to several factors that influence their ability and willingness to follow IPC guidelines when managing respiratory infectious diseases. These include factors tied to the guideline itself and how it is communicated, support from managers, workplace culture, training, physical space, access to and trust in personal protective equipment, and a desire to deliver good patient care. The review also highlights the importance of including all facility staff, including support staff, when implementing IPC guidelines.","Houghton, Catherine; Meskell, Pauline; Delaney, Hannah; Smalle, Mike; Glenton, Claire; Booth, Andrew; Chan, Xin Hui S; Devane, Declan; Biesty, Linda M",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,62,1

Among these are the cysteine cathepsins, members of the family of papain-like cysteine proteases. They have unique reactive-site properties and an uneven tissue-specific expression pattern. In living organisms their activity is a delicate balance of expression, targeting, zymogen activation, inhibition by protein inhibitors and degradation. The specificity of their substrate binding sites, small-molecule inhibitor repertoire and crystal structures are providing new tools for research and development. Their unique reactive-site properties have made it possible to confine the targets simply by the use of appropriate reactive groups. The epoxysuccinyls still dominate the field, but now nitriles seem to be the most appropriate “warhead”. The view of cysteine cathepsins as lysosomal proteases is changing as there is now clear evidence of their localization in other cellular compartments. Besides being involved in protein turnover, they build an important part of the endosomal antigen presentation. Together with the growing number of non-endosomal roles of cysteine cathepsins is growing also the knowledge of their involvement in diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, among others. Finally, cysteine cathepsins are important regulators and signaling molecules of an unimaginable number of biological processes. The current challenge is to identify their endogenous substrates, in order to gain an insight into the mechanisms of substrate degradation and processing. In this review, some of the remarkable advances that have taken place in the past decade are presented. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteolysis 50 years after the discovery of lysosome.","Turk, Vito; Stoka, Veronika; Vasiljeva, Olga; Renko, Miha; Sun, Tao; Turk, Boris; Turk, Dušan",Biochim Biophys Acta Proteins Proteom,62,1

However, no available papers discussed the risk of exposure of family members (FM) of HWs. Aims The present study collected the data of SARS-COV-2 positive FM of HWs using serological rapid IgM/IgG tests (SRT) compared with positive HWs at SRT and serological quantitative IgG test (SQT). Methods The study was conducted from 2nd to 31th May 2020. 38 HWs were tested by both SRT and SQT; 81 FMs were screened using SRT. Descriptive statistical analyses were used to summarize the data. Results Of the 38 HWs, 2 (5,3%) showed IgG line at SRT, confirmed by SQT. 32 HWs decided self-isolation from the family during SARS-COV-2 spreading. Out of 81 FMs, 26 (32,1%) were found IgG positive at SRT. 11 (42%) of them had symptoms typical for COVID-19 in the study period. In two families, the HWs were the only negative case. Conclusions General population’s exposure to COVID-19 was less controlled than HWs’ one. HWs experienced lower infection’s rate than their families and did not represented a risk of transmission for relatives.","Dioscoridi, Lorenzo; Carrisi, Chiara",Int J Infect Dis,62,16

Altered epidermal barrier and aberrant KC differentiation are involved in the pathophysiology of several skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD). AD is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by cutaneous and systemic immune dysregulation and skin microbiota dysbiosis. Nevertheless, the pathological mechanisms of this complex disease remain largely unknown. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the participation of the KC in different aspects of the AD. We provide an overview of the genetic predisposing and environmental factors, inflammatory molecules and signaling pathways of the KC that participate in the physiopathology of the AD. We also analyze the link among the KC, the microbiota and the inflammatory response underlying acute and chronic skin AD lesions.","Gallegos-Alcalá, Pamela; Jiménez, Mariela; Cervantes-García, Daniel; Salinas, Eva",Int J Mol Sci,62,24
