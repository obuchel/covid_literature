11510,Productive Aging in the Social Work Profession: A Comparison of Licensed Workers 60 Years and Older with Their Younger Counterparts,2020-01-28,"This study surveys the clinical relevance of the nasal Staphylococcus aureus colonization status on intensive care unit (ICU)–acquired S. aureus infections and compares molecular characteristics of isolates from the nose and infectious sites. The 390 patients included comprised 278 non-carriers and 112 carriers. Among the carriers, 56 were decolonized with mupirocin. Decolonization was verified through a second (negative) culture. Spa typing and virulence gene profiling were performed for all isolates. Twenty six S. aureus infections were detected in the carriage group and 20 in the non-carriage group. Eighteen of these 26 (69.2%) infections were among carriers, and 8 of these 26 (30.8%) infections occurred among decolonized carriers (p = 0.02). Overall, 31/112 (27.7%) of the colonized patients and 25/46 (60.1%) of infection were due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The highest frequency virulence genes were sea and hlg (both 100%) in nasal isolates and sea, hlg, fnb, and clf (100%) for infectious isolates. t030 was the most abundant spa type overall. S. aureus carriers were more likely to develop S. aureus infection compared with decolonized and non-carrying patients. The sources of ICU S. aureus infection appear to be exogenous mostly, and a predominant clone (spa type 030) plays an important role. We confirm that nasal mupirocin treatment prevents ICU infections even when there is an increased prevalence of nosocomial MRSA.","Akhtar Danesh, Leila; Saiedi Nejad, Zeinab; Sarmadian, Hossein; Fooladvand, Saeed; van Belkum, Alex; Ghaznavi-Rad, Ehsanollah",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224068/,615
16519,Communicative competencies anchored longitudinally – the curriculum “personal and professional development” in the model study programme in undergraduate medical education at the University of Witten/Herdecke,2021-03-15,"Faculty development programs (FD) prepare the faculty for their educational role and career tasks. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of FDP in advancing the quality of short-answer questions (SAQs). This was a quasi-experimental study, comprising 37 new faculty. The SAQs were examined on psychometric analysis and Bloom’s cognitive levels for the two educational blocks of 1st medical year (i.e. Musculoskeletal (MSK) and Renal blocks). We found substantial improvement in the discrimination index values of SAQs prepared after the workshop (p = 0.04). A higher number of SAQs with moderate difficulty and higher discrimination were also observed. Flaws within the post-workshop questions were reduced (3.0%) when compared with pre-workshop (12.5%). The major incline was also reported within Bloom’s cognitive levels when pre-workshop K2 questions (30%) were compared with post-workshop (45.5%) with a p-value = 0.05. The SAQs constructed by the faculty member without participating in FDP are generally of unsatisfactory quality. After the FDP the assessment items of two blocks improved for various parameters of student assessment. The current study advocates that newly joined faculty shall be provided with the FDP to be guided, trained and supported for improving the quality of assessment through SAQs items writing.","Abdulghani, Hamza Mohammad; Sattar, Kamran; Ahmad, Tauseef; Akram, Ashfaq; Khalil, Mahmoud Salah",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8007032/,615
17755,Recognizing obesity as a disease: A true challenge(),2021-05-25,"Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a type of bone metabolism disease-related to estrogen deficiency with an increasing incidence. Traditional Chinese (TCM) has always been used and showed effectiveness in treating PMOP. In the current study, Bu-Yang herbs were considered to be the most frequently used and efficient TCM herbs in PMOP treatment. However, chemical and pharmacological profiles were not elucidated. Network pharmacology was conducted on representative Bu-Yang herbs (Yin-Yang-Huo. Du-Zhong, Bu-Gu-Zhi, Tu-Si-Zi) to investigate the mechanism of Bu-Yang herbs on PMOP. Chemical compounds, potential targets, and disease related genes were available from the corresponding database. Results showed that Bu-Yang herbs could interact with ESR1 and estrogen signaling pathways. For further validation, the Bu-Yang decoction (BYD), formula consisted of the above-mentioned 4 Bu-Yang herbs was presented for experimental validation. In vivo, BYD significantly reversed ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis progress in a dose-dependent manner by up-regulation of bone mineral density and amelioration of bone microarchitecture. In vitro, BYD dramatically improved the proliferation and mineral nodules formation of osteoblasts. Both in vitro and in vivo results illustrated that the phenotype change induced by BYD is correlated with up-regulated of ESR1 and activation of the β-catenin pathway. Meanwhile, inhibition of ESR1 by ICI182, 780 blocked the osteogenic phenotype and β-catenin pathway activation induced by BYD. In conclusion, the current study suggested that Bu-Yang herbs are the most useful TCM herbs in treating PMOP. Furthermore, the integrated strategy of network pharmacology prediction with experimental validation suggested that BYD exerted its anti-PMOP via ESR1 and the downstream mechanism might be activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway.","Xia, Hanting; Liu, Jiangyuan; Yang, Wenlong; Liu, Min; Luo, Yunfeng; Yang, Zhijun; Xie, Jingbo; Zeng, Huiliang; Xu, Rui; Ling, Houfu; Zeng, Qinghe; Xu, Huihui; Fang, Liang; Wang, Hongyu; Tong, Peijian; Jin, Hongting; Yang, Fengyun",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8144472/,615
19227,Operation mode selection of NIMBY facility Public Private Partnership projects,2021-07-09,"HYPOTHESIS: It is hypothesised that a combination of childhood and later life infections and excess food consumption, particularly of Western style food, initiates and contributes to atherosclerotic coronary heart disease. To consider this hypothesis we have conducted a brief review of the role of childhood infections, food, and their combined influence on atherosclerosis. EVIDENCE: (i) Studies of populations with high prevalence of infections and low “hunter gather” like food consumption, have extremely low prevalence of atherosclerosis, (ii) there are consistent associations between infections in childhood and adult atherosclerotic coronary heart disease, (iii) there is an association between increased body weight, (an indication of excess eating), and atherosclerotic heart disease, and (iv) there is evidence that a combination of increased body weight and infections influences the development of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease. Infections do not appear to act independently to cause atherosclerosis. A combination of both food and infection appears to be required to cause atheroma. CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that infections when combined with excess eating initiates atherosclerosis, is plausible. ACTION: Action aimed at prevention of atherosclerotic heart disease is possible. There are three safe approaches to prevention (i) encouragement of Mediterranean like diets, (ii) avoidance of overeating and (iii) vigorous control of infections among all age groups. There is a need to monitor patients with a history of serious childhood infections and poor nutrition. In addition, for high risk subjects, cholesterol lowering statins are of proven and safe value.","Lawson, James S.; Glenn, Wendy K.",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8273202/,615
19723,Motivations and Career Decisions in Occupational Therapy Course: A Qualitative Inquiry of Asia-Pacific International Students in Australia,2021-07-28,"In the modern era, the relative ease and faster speed of travel have made the world a global village. An increasing number of people are traveling to distant and sometimes exotic locations for vacation/leisure or at times for business purposes. Along with the experiences of far-fetched lands, sometimes they bring bugs/organisms that are not native to their motherland. This makes the diagnosis and management of illnesses in a traveler challenging.

19941,The value and impact of embedded implementation research: insights from Latin America and the Caribbean,2021-08-06,"OBJECTIVE: This study attempted to screen and combine effective biomarkers to analyse the association between these biomarkers and gastrointestinal failure (GIF) in critically ill patients. METHODS: A total of 110 critically ill patients with acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) admitted to ICU were enrolled. The AGI grade was determined by the AGI classification proposed by ESICM. There were 67 patients in gastrointestinal dysfunction (GID) group (AGI grade II), 43 patients in GIF group (AGI grade III–IV), and 41 healthy adults in healthy control (HC) group. APACHE II and SOFA score were used to evaluate the disease severity. Peripheral blood samples of patients were collected within 24 hours of admission to the ICU (prior-treatment) and after the conventional medication therapy for 7 consecutive days (post-treatment). Citrulline serum level was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method, and D-lactate and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serum levels were measured by ELISA. Pearson correlation, logistic regression, and ROC curve analysis were used. RESULTS: Patients with GID or GIF had lower serum level of citrulline, while higher levels of D-lactate and LPS than HC. Compared with GID patients, serum level of citrulline was reduced, while D-lactate and LPS were elevated in GIF patients. Correlation analysis displayed that serum levels of citrulline, D-lactate, and LPS were associated with the APACHE II and SOFA score in patients with GID or GIF. Logistics regression analysis showed that citrulline and D-lactate were risk for both GID and GIF. ROC curve analysis exhibited that combination of citrulline and D-lactate had relatively high value to distinguish GID from HC, GIF from GID, and GIF from HC. CONCLUSION: Serum citrulline and D-lactate were associated with severity of GIF, combination of citrulline and D-lactate improved the diagnostic efficacy to identify GIF in critically ill patients.","Teng, Jin; Xiang, Lu; Long, Huaicong; Gao, Caiping; Lei, Lei; Zhang, Yinghui",Int J Gen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8349205/,615

38228,Active Telephonic Follow-up During COVID-19 Lockdown: Initial Experience,2020-06-24,"Noting the analytical and empirical significance of the topic, this research revisits the theme of income convergence across the US states. The work fills several gaps in the existing literature by (a) covering the most recent period 1997–2018, (b) using the official data on real GDP per capita compiled by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), (c) explicitly comparing the convergence scenario for 1997–2018 with that for 1977–1997, and (d) placing the observed patterns in the context of Piketty-like propositions about high returns to capital and increasing income inequality. One significant outcome of the exercise is an indication of sigma-divergence across the US states, as reflected in increased standard deviation of logs and coefficient of variation over the period, which correspond to a highly significant positive trend in both. Lack of significant beta-convergence is also of interest as is the contrast in the convergence patterns for 1977–1997 and 1997–2018. A simple explanation for income-divergence is pursued by studying the pattern of changes in K/L ratios across states from 2000 to 2015, and it is found that, contrary to the expected pattern of resource flows, K/L ratio tended to increase more in the high K/L-ratio states than in the low K/L areas. This divergence in K/L ratio underlies the sigma-divergence in income. The observed pattern may be deemed consistent with Piketty-like propositions about the high and increasing returns to capital which impeded its move to the poorer states with low K/L ratio.","Ram, Rati",J Econ Finan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7438399/,615

As such, we have collaborated with our community partners to hold 12 “Fireside Chats” (2 in person, and 10 virtually due to COVID-19) between December 2019 and September 2020. Our expert speakers and panelists have given presentations on a variety of topics, specifically focused on coping with COVID-19, such as physical, music, and arts-based activities to do in the home, advance care planning, local services and supports, resiliency, and mindfulness. A total of 463 participants attended the Fireside Chats. A total of 169 attendees completed evaluations regarding the programs (a completion rate of 37%). Attendees were primarily White (86%), non-Hispanic (95%), well educated (86% had a college degree or higher), about half of the group were community caregivers (55%), while the other attendees were primarily from health professional backgrounds (e.g., nursing, social work, physical therapy). We obtained evaluation data in seven domains based on a 5-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree). The mean level of agreement in the seven following domains were: satisfaction (M=4.68/SD=.53), effectiveness (M=4.72/SD=.52), met stated goals (M=4.70/SD=.53), met educational needs (M=4.64/SD=.6), will improve the care they provide (M=4.57/SD=.70), included useful examples (M=4.59/SD=.66), and was better than similar trainings (M=4.23/SD=.86).

44498,Special Section: The future of place branding,2021-01-11,"Negotiations were introduced in [6] as a model for concurrent systems with multiparty decisions. What is very appealing with negotiations is that it is one of the very few non-trivial concurrent models where several interesting problems, such as soundness, i.e. absence of deadlocks, can be solved in PTIME [3]. In this paper, we introduce the model of timed negotiations and consider the problem of computing the minimum and the maximum execution times of a negotiation. The latter can be solved using the algorithm of [10] computing costs in negotiations, but surprisingly minimum execution time cannot. This paper proposes new algorithms to compute both minimum and maximum execution time, that work in much more general classes of negotiations than [10], that only considered sound and deterministic negotiations. Further, we uncover the precise complexities of these questions, ranging from PTIME to [Formula: see text] -complete. In particular, we show that computing the minimum execution time is more complex than computing the maximum execution time in most classes of negotiations we consider.","Akshay, S.; Genest, Blaise; Hélouët, Loïc; Mital, Sharvik",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7788631/,615

Those endorsing the rights of genocide survivors to reparative justice include the Network of International Non-Governmental Organizations in Rwanda, the East African Community, and individuals who have served in the past and present in Rwandan government agencies and ministries. It reaffirms the need for international human rights soft law that will be held as a standard by which NGOs should be held accountable for human rights respect and fulfillment because their current systems of voluntary self-regulation are insufficient and dysfunctional. It shows that with a reasonable and substantive financial commitment to reparative justice, NGOs and the Rwandan government could dramatically transform the lives of Rwandan genocide survivors and respect, protect, and fulfill their human rights, and specifically, their right to reparative justice.","Schimmel, Noam",Advancing International Human Rights Law Responsibilities of Development NGOs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991144/,615
51277,Concerns about COVID-19 and tuberculosis in Brazil: Social and public health impacts,2021-04-02,"COVID‐19 has led many governments to impose lockdowns in efforts to reduce the spread of the virus. One of the many consequences of the lockdown is a reduction in crime. We apply a difference‐in‐differences approach to the 2018–2020 Crime Statistics to investigate the effect of the 2020 lockdown on crime victimization in Japan. We find that the 2020 lockdown leads to 12.7% and 20.9% declines in violent and property crime victimization rates per 100,000 people, respectively. Moreover, we observe that premeditated crimes, such as breaking‐and‐entering and sexual assault, decline more than non‐premeditated crimes, such as homicide. We also explore the heterogeneous effects of the lockdown by age groups. We observe that there is a significant decline in sexual assault victimization for those between the ages of 0 and 29, and there are significant declines in overall violent and property crime victimizations and their subtypes for those between ages of 30 and 59. Finally, we show that there is an improvement in suicide rates, which suggests that better mental health is the mechanism partially mediating the relationship between lockdown and crime victimization.","Shen, Yichen; Fu, Rong; Noguchi, Haruko",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8013736/,615

In order to satisfy the learners and to impart them quality knowledge and education, e-learning content comprising of excellent learning and website content is of paramount importance. In the present COVID-19 outbreak challenging times the significance of e-learning system development and its application is much more pronounced. To gauge this, the study aims to examine the relationship between learner-content and the e-learning quality to determine the impact of e-learning quality on learners’ satisfaction under the moderating effect of perceived harm due to COVID-19. A structured questionnaire was used to gather data from 435 graduate and undergraduate management students (International and national) in Indian Universities. Findings indicate statistically significant relationships between the e-learning content and e-learning quality and; e-learning quality and the students’ satisfaction.

56549,Building from the Ashes: Towards a Three-Dimensional Approach for Social Work Intervention Facing Social Conflicts in Vulnerable Neighbourhoods,2021-07-27,"ABSTRACT: Bacterial biofilm infections have been threatening the human’s life and health globally for a long time because they typically cause chronic and persistent infections. Traditional antibiotic therapies can hardly eradicate biofilms in many cases, as biofilms always form a robust fortress for pathogens inside, inhibiting the penetration of drugs. To address the issues, many novel drug carriers emerged as promising strategies for biofilm treatment. Among them, stimuli-responsive nanocarriers have attracted much attentions for their intriguing physicochemical properties, such as tunable size, shape and surface chemistry, especially smart drug release characteristic. Based on the microenvironmental difference between biofilm infection sites and normal tissue, many stimuli, such as bacterial products accumulating in biofilms (enzymes, glutathione, etc.), lower pH and higher H(2)O(2) levels, have been employed and proved in favor of “on-demand” drug release for biofilm elimination. Additionally, external stimuli including light, heat, microwave and magnetic fields are also able to control the drug releasing behavior artificially. In this review, we summarized recent advances in stimuli-responsive nanocarriers for combating biofilm infections, and mainly, focusing on the different stimuli that trigger the drug release. 摘要: 细菌生物膜常造成长期, 顽固的感染, 因此长久以来都严重威胁着全球人类的生命健康。 由于生物膜会为内部病原体建造其保护性屏障, 阻碍药物的渗透, 因此传统的抗生素疗法通常难以根除生物膜。 为了解决这一问题, 研究人员构建了许多新型的药物载体, 以作为颇具前景的生物膜治疗策略。 其中, 刺激响应型纳米载体具有有趣的物理-化学性质, 例如尺寸, 形状和表面化学可调节的性质, 特别是智能药物释放性质, 因此吸引了人们的广泛关注。 根据生物膜感染位置和正常组织之间的微环境差异, 人们利用多种刺激物, 比如生物膜内积累的细菌产物 (酶, 谷胱甘肽等), 低pH和高H(2)O(2)水平, 来设计药物的“按需释放”以清除生物膜。 此外, 包括光, 热, 微波和磁场在内的外源刺激, 也可以用于人工控制药物的释放行为。 本篇综述中, 我们总结了刺激响应型纳米载体在对抗细菌生物膜中的最新进展, 并着重于引发药物释放的多种刺激物。 GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: [Image: see text]","Ding, Meng; Zhao, Wei; Song, Ling-Jie; Luan, Shi-Fang",Rare Metals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8333162/,615
57745,What Changes for Young Carers? A Qualitative Evaluation of the Impact of Dedicated Support Provision for Young Carers,2021-09-14,"Health care personnel attitudes toward refugee claimant entitlement to health care are influenced by multilevel factors including institutional and societal culture. Although individual attitudes may be modified through training, macro- and meso-issues require system-level interventions. This paper analyzes the role of individual-, institutional-, and city-level factors in shaping attitudes toward refugee claimants’ access to health care among Canadian health care personnel. A total of 4207 health care personnel in 16 institutions located in Montreal and Toronto completed an online survey on attitudes regarding health care access for refugee claimants. We used multilevel logistic regression analysis to identify individual-, institutional-, and city-level predictors of endorsing access to care. Participants who had prior contact with refugee claimants had greater odds of endorsing access to care than those who did not (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.05, 1.21). Attitudes varied with occupation: social workers had the highest probability of endorsing equal access to health care (.83; 95% CI .77, .89) followed by physicians (.77; 95% CI .71, .82). An estimated 7.97% of the individual variation in endorsement of equal access to health care was attributable to differences between institutions, but this association was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for city residence. Results indicate that the contexts in which health care professionals live and work are important when understanding opinions on access to health care for vulnerable populations. They suggest that institutional interventions promoting a collective mission to care for vulnerable populations may improve access to health care for precarious status migrants.","Rousseau, Cécile; Rummens, Joanna Anneke; Frounfelker, Rochelle L.; Yebenes, Monica Ruiz Casares; Cleveland, Janet",J Int Migr Integr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8429477/,615

PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed clinical characteristics and outcomes from patients with cancer and concurrent COVID-19 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center until March 31, 2020 (n = 309), and observed clinical end points until April 13, 2020. We hypothesized that cytotoxic chemotherapy administered within 35 days of a COVID-19 diagnosis is associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of severe or critical COVID-19. In secondary analyses, we estimated associations between specific clinical and laboratory variables and the incidence of a severe or critical COVID-19 event. RESULTS Cytotoxic chemotherapy administration was not significantly associated with a severe or critical COVID-19 event (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.60). Hematologic malignancy was associated with increased COVID-19 severity (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.80). Patients with lung cancer also demonstrated higher rates of severe or critical COVID-19 events (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.20 to 3.30). Lymphopenia at COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with higher rates of severe or critical illness (HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.50 to 3.10). Patients with baseline neutropenia 14-90 days before COVID-19 diagnosis had worse outcomes (HR, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.70 to 11.00). Findings from these analyses remained consistent in a multivariable model and in multiple sensitivity analyses. The rate of adverse events was lower in a time-matched population of patients with cancer without COVID-19. CONCLUSION Recent cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment was not associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Patients with active hematologic or lung malignancies, peri-COVID-19 lymphopenia, or baseline neutropenia had worse COVID-19 outcomes. Interactions among antineoplastic therapy, cancer type, and COVID-19 are complex and warrant further investigation.","Jee, Justin; Foote, Michael B; Lumish, Melissa; Stonestrom, Aaron J; Wills, Beatriz; Narendra, Varun; Avutu, Viswatej; Murciano-Goroff, Yonina R; Chan, Jason E; Derkach, Andriy; Philip, John; Belenkaya, Rimma; Kerpelev, Marina; Maloy, Molly; Watson, Adam; Fong, Chris; Janjigian, Yelena; Diaz, Luis A; Bolton, Kelly L; Pessin, Melissa S",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.20.01307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32795225/,615

We incorporated mortality risks from RCC, radiation-induced cancers (for procedural and follow-up CT scans), and all other causes; institutional data informed the RFA procedural effective dose. Radiation-induced cancer risks were generated using an organ-specific approach. Effects of varying model parameters and of dose-reduction strategies were evaluated in sensitivity analysis. RESULTS. Cumulative RFA exposures (up to 305.2 mSv for one session plus surveillance) exceeded those from surgery (up to 87.2 mSv). In 65-year-old men, excess LE loss from radiation-induced cancers, comparing RFA to surgery, was 11.7 days (14.6 days for RFA vs 2.9 days for surgery). Results varied with sex and age; this difference increased to 14.6 days in 65-year-old women and to 21.5 days in 55-year-old men. Dose-reduction strategies that addressed follow-up rather than procedural exposure had a greater impact. In 65-year-old men, this difference decreased to 3.8 days if post-RFA follow-up scans were restricted to a single phase; even elimination of RFA procedural exposure could not achieve equivalent benefits. CONCLUSION. CT-guided RFA remains a safe alternative to surgery, but with decreasing age, the higher burden of radiation exposure merits explicit consideration. Dose-reduction strategies that target follow-up rather than procedural exposure will have a greater impact.","Eisenberg, Jonathan D; Gervais, Debra A; Singh, Sarabjeet; Kalra, Mannudeep K; Sabir, Sharjeel H; Paul, Aaron B; Pandharipande, Pari V",AJR.

Commonly refractory to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), LVOs place large cerebral territories at ischemic risk and cause high rates of morbidity and mortality without further treatment. Over the past few years, an abundance of high-quality data has demonstrated the efficacy of endovascular thrombectomy for improving clinical outcomes in patients with LVOs, transforming the treatment algorithm for affected patients. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, natural history, and clinical presentation of LVOs as a framework for understanding the recent clinical strides of the endovascular era.","Rennert, Robert C; Wali, Arvin R; Steinberg, Jeffrey A; Santiago-Dieppa, David R; Olson, Scott E; Pannell, J Scott; Khalessi, Alexander A",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyz042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31197329/,615

Viruses evade innate immunity and limit secretion of beta interferon (IFN-β) to replicate and survive in the host. The largest tegument protein of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), UL36, contains a novel deubiquitinase (DUB) motif embedded in its N terminus, denoted UL36 ubiquitin-specific protease (UL36USP). In the present study, we demonstrate that HSV-1 UL36USP inhibits Sendai virus (SeV)-induced interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) dimerization, promoter activation, and transcription of IFN-β. The DUB activity of UL36USP is essential to block IFN-β production. UL36USP also inhibited IFN-β promoter activity induced by overexpression of the N terminus of RIG-I (RIG-IN) and MAVS, but not TBK-1, IκB kinase ε (IKKε), and IRF3/5D. UL36USP was subsequently shown to deubiquitinate TRAF3 and prevent the recruitment of the downstream adaptor TBK1. The recombinant HSV-1 lacking UL36USP DUB activity was generated. Cells infected with the mutant virus produced more IFN-β than wild-type (WT) HSV-1-infected cells. These findings demonstrate HSV-1 UL36USP removes polyubiquitin chains on TRAF3 and counteracts the IFN-β pathway.","Wang, Shuai; Wang, Kezhen; Li, Jie; Zheng, Chunfu",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01211-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23986588/,615

This study included 46 drug-naive children aged 4-17 y diagnosed with ASD. The Autism Behavior Checklist (AuBC), Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), and Children's chronotype questionnaire (CCQ) were filled out before and at the end of the COVID-19 mandated home confinement by the children's parents. Children with ASD during the home confinement reported higher chronotype scores, i.e., eveningness chronotype, sleep problems, and autism symptom scores compared to the normal non-hone confinement state. The chronotype score and sleep problems of children with ASD during the home confinement period varied according to the AuBC score. The sleep problems of the children with ASD during the home confinement period mediated the relationship between chronotype score and severity of autism symptoms. It is essential to validate the role of the mediator effect of sleep problems and chronotype in larger samples of children with ASD with restricted to home confinement during the pandemic period. If sleep problems can be controlled with parental education, pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapeutic interventions, the impact on children with ASD of home confinement can be reduced.","Türkoğlu, Serhat; Uçar, Halit Necmi; Çetin, Fatih Hilmi; Güler, Hasan Ali; Tezcan, Muatafa Esat",Chronobiology international,https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2020.1792485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32746638/,615

For years, subcutaneous vaccination was recommended in patients with hemophilia to avoid intramuscular bleeds. Therefore, recommendations for the application of COVID-19 vaccines are needed. METHODS The Delphi methodology was used to develop consensus recommendations. An initial list of recommendations was prepared by a steering committee and evaluated by 39 hemophilia experts. Consensus was defined as ≥75% agreement and strong consensus as ≥95% agreement, and agreement as a score ≥7 on a scale of 1 to 9. After four rounds, a final list of statements was compiled. RECOMMENDATIONS Consensus was achieved that COVID-19 vaccines licensed only for intramuscular injection should be administered intramuscularly in hemophilia patients. Prophylactic factor replacement, given on the day of vaccination with a maximum interval between prophylaxis and vaccination of 24 hours (factor VIII and conventional factor IX concentrates) or 48 hours (half-life extended factor IX), should be provided in patients with moderate or severe hemophilia. Strong consensus was achieved that patients with mild hemophilia and residual factor activity greater than 10% with mild bleeding phenotype or patients on emicizumab usually do not need factor replacement before vaccination. Swelling, erythema, and hyperthermia after vaccination are not always signs of bleeding but should prompt consultation of a hemophilia care center. In case of injection-site hematoma, patients should receive replacement therapy until symptoms disappear. CONCLUSIONS Consensus was achieved on recommendations for intramuscular COVID-19 vaccination after replacement therapy for hemophilia patients depending on disease severity.","Pfrepper, Christian; Holstein, Katharina; Königs, Christoph; Heller, Christine; Krause, Manuela; Olivieri, Martin; Bidlingmaier, Christoph; Sigl-Kraetzig, Michael; Wendisch, Jörg; Halimeh, Susan; Horneff, Silvia; Richter, Heinrich; Wieland, Ivonne; Klamroth, Robert; Oldenburg, Johannes; Tiede, Andreas",Hamostaseologie,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1401-2691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33860513/,615

She underwent simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation for type 1 diabetes 8 years previously followed by a renal transplant 1 year prior to presentation, and was taking tacrolimus as long-term immunosuppression. The full blood count showed haemoglobin 97 g/L, platelet count 2×109/L and neutrophil count 0.22×109/L. Peripheral blood film examination confirmed genuine thrombocytopenia in the absence of any haemolytic or malignant features. Serological testing identified autoantibodies against all three blood lineages, consistent with a diagnosis of autoimmune pancytopenia. Treatment with steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, romiplostim and mycophenolate mofetil achieved only fleeting remissions. Blood counts eventually normalised following the administration of rituximab and a change from tacrolimus to ciclosporin immunosuppression. Cytopenias are a well-recognised complication of post-transplantation care but we believe this to be the first reported case of autoimmune pancytopenia following solid organ transplantation.

CASE REPORT We report of a 19-year-old man presenting with left-sided, total ophthalmoplegia after a traffic accident. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed a dissection beginning at the cervical segment of internal carotid artery (ICA) together with a dissecting aneurysm in the cavernous segment. A stent was placed in the narrowed and dissected segment of ICA, and the dissecting aneurysm of the cavernous segment was successfully managed with a stent-assisted coil embolization. After the endovascular treatment of the aneurysm, a full recovery of cranial nerve function was achieved.

When evaluated specifically for pain, the data so far have shown that myalgia, headache, and chest pain can be seen in patients at varying rates; myalgia and headache, especially, are among the initial symptoms. DESIGN This retrospective chart review followed by a descriptive survey design study was carried out by examining patients afflicted with COVID-19. After discharge, patients were asked about the severity and the body region of their pain, their use of analgesics, their mood and mental health, and their overall quality of life. RESULTS A total of 206 patients with a mean age of 56.24 ± 16.99 were included in the study. Pain during COVID-19 was found to be higher compared to the pre- and postinfectious states. The most frequent painful areas were reported to be the neck and back before the infection, whereas the head and extremities during the infection. The most frequently used analgesic during infection was paracetamol. There was no relationship between the patients' pain and anxiety and depression; the quality of life was found to be worse in patients with persistent pain. CONCLUSION This study showed that the head and extremities were the most common painful body regions during COVID-19. It was also found that pain can continue in the post-infection period.","Erçalık, Tülay; Ayyıldız, Aylin; Gencer-Atalay, Kardelen; Akgün, Cem; Özdemir, Hacı Mustafa; Kuran, Banu",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1097/phm.0000000000001699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33480608/,615

Over the last few decades, several efforts have been made by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to address disparities in liver transplantation with notable improvements in many areas. Nonetheless, disparities have persisted across insurance type, gender, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and age. African Americans have lower rates of referral to transplant centers, females have lower rates of transplantation from the liver waitlist than males, and public insurance is associated with worse post-transplant outcomes than private insurance. Additionally, pediatric candidates and older adults have a disadvantage on the liver transplant waitlist, and there are widespread regional disparities in transplantation.

Conversion to Roux-en-Y bypass is recommended but might not be suitable for all patients. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who underwent laparoscopic hiatal repair and gastropexy for intractable GERD after LSG between 2015 and 2017. Data on upper gastrointestinal (GI) study findings and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use was collected. The GERD-health-related quality of life (GERD-HRQL) questionnaire assessed patient symptoms. Perioperative outcomes, GERD symptoms, and medication details were analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients were included. Mean interval from the initial LSG to revision surgery was 40.8 months (range, 6-108). Mean body mass index before LSG was 34 kg/m2, whereas that before revision surgery was 25.7 kg/m2. Mean revision surgery time was 126 min, whereas the mean length of stay was 3.6 days. No major surgical complication occurred. The mean GERD-HRQL score before revision surgery was 24.3 and decreased to 12.3 at 1 month after surgery. Mean GERD-HRQL scores at 6, 12, and 24 months after revision surgery were 16.8, 17.4, and 18.9, respectively. All patients required daily proton pump inhibitor pre-operatively; only 26% could discontinue them postoperatively. Of the 28 patients, 14 (50.0%) were satisfied with the surgery, 8 (28.6%) had a neutral attitude, and 6 (21.4%) were dissatisfied. Three (11.1%) patients agreed to undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. CONCLUSION Hiatal repair with gastropexy is an acceptable treatment option for GERD after LSG but not very effective because of partial remission of symptoms.","Soong, Tien-Chou; Almalki, Owaid M; Lee, Wei-Jei; Ser, Kong-Han; Chen, Jung-Chien; Wu, Chun-Chi; Chen, Shu-Chun",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-019-03853-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001757/,615

An important risk factor for disease severity is obesity. Our primary objective was to conduct a systematic review examining weight loss and dietary interventions, in HS. Our secondary objective was to examine nutritional supplements in HS.A systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database. We included all study types in adults (>18 years), with a minimum sample size of 5, examining the effects of any dietary or weight loss intervention on HS severity. Two authors screened n = 1279 articles of which 9 met inclusion criteria. All included studies were observational and all interventions were associated with various measures of decreased HS severity. Patient-controlled weight loss and bariatric surgery were associated with HS regression, though a subset of patients with significant increase in panniculi experienced exacerbations and required excision of excess skin. Diets demonstrating benefit eliminated dairy and brewer's yeast. Nutritional supplements including zinc gluconate, vitamin D, and riboflavin had a suppressive, rather than curative, effect on HS lesions in single studies.

APPROACH Following the SARS outbreak, China made huge investments to improve surveillance, emergency preparedness and response capacity and strengthen public health institutions. In 2013, the return on these investments was evaluated by investigating China's early response to the emergence of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in humans. LOCAL SETTING Clusters of human infection with a novel influenza virus were detected in China - by national surveillance of pneumonia of unknown etiology - on 26 February 2013. RELEVANT CHANGES On 31 March 2013, China notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of the first recorded human infections with A(H7N9) virus. Poultry markets - which were rapidly identified as a major source of transmission of A(H7N9) to humans - were closed down in the affected areas. Surveillance in humans and poultry was heightened and technical guidelines were quickly updated and disseminated. The health authorities collaborated with WHO in risk assessments and risk communication. New cases were reported promptly and publicly. LESSONS LEARNT The relevant infrastructures, surveillance systems and response capacity need to be strengthened in preparation for future emergencies caused by emerging or existing disease threats. Results of risk assessments and other data should be released promptly and publicly and such release should not jeopardize future publication of the data in scientific journals. Coordination between public health and veterinary services would be stronger during an emergency if these services had already undertaken joint preparedness planning.","Vong, Sirenda; O'Leary, Michael; Feng, Zijian",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.13.125989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24700999/,615

82598,"A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study of obeticholic acid for primary sclerosing cholangitis.",2020-03-09,"BACKGROUND Iatrogenic ureteral injury (IUI) following abdominal surgery has a relatively low incidence, but is associated with high risks of morbidity and mortality. Conventional assessment of IUI includes visual inspection and palpation. This is especially challenging during laparoscopic procedures and has translated into an increased risk of IUI. The use of near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) imaging is currently being considered as a novel method to identify the ureters intraoperatively. The aim of this review is to describe the currently available and experimental dyes for ureter visualization and to evaluate their feasibility of using them and their effectiveness. METHODS This article adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standard for systematic reviews. A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed database. All included articles were screened for eligibility by two authors. Three clinical trial databases were consulted to identify ongoing or completed unpublished trials. Risk of bias was assessed for all articles. RESULTS The search yielded 20 articles on ureter visualization. Two clinically available dyes, indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB), and eight experimental dyes were described and assessed for their feasibility to identify the ureter. Two ongoing clinical trials on CW800-BK and one trial on ZW800-1 for ureter visualization were identified. CONCLUSIONS Currently available dyes, ICG and MB, are safe, but suboptimal for ureter visualization based on the route of administration and optical properties, respectively. Currently, MB has potential to be routinely used for ureter visualization in most patients, but (cRGD-)ZW800-1 holds potential for this role in the future, owing to its exclusive renal clearance and the near absence of background. To assess the benefit of NIRF imaging for reducing the incidence of IUI, larger patient cohorts need to be examined.","Slooter, M D; Janssen, A; Bemelman, W A; Tanis, P J; Hompes, R",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-019-01973-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030340/,615

The goal of this study was to evaluate the strategy of stent only therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of 20 patients with 20 intracranial fusiform aneurysms undergoing endovascular treatment using stent only therapy was undertaken. Feasibility, safety, and angiographic follow-up were evaluated. RESULTS 28 Leo Plus stents were successfully deployed in 20 patients. No technical difficulties in relation to stent navigation, placement, or detachment from the delivery system were observed. A 6 month, 1 year, and 2 year follow-up angiograms were performed in all patients. 15 aneurysms showed complete occlusion and five partial stable occlusion. During the follow-up period, there was no evidence of in-stent stenoses or occlusion of the incorporated branching vessels. In this study, no patient presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage or died during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Stent only therapy in this study proved very useful as a flow diverter for the treatment of intracranial fusiform aneurysms in which parent artery occlusion or stenting-coiling was not feasible.","Pumar, José Manuel; Arias-Rivas, Susana; Rodríguez-Yáñez, Manuel; Blanco, Miguel; Ageitos, Maria; Vazquez-Herrero, Fernando; Castiñeira-Mourenza, José Antonio; Masso, Amaya",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23585639/,615

99310,Can men's increased susceptibility to COVID-19 be attributed to transmembrane protease serine 2?,2020,"AIMS To evaluate five commercially available sporicidal wipes and two disinfecting wipes for their ability to inactivate Bacillus atrophaeus spores deposited onto various material surfaces. METHODS AND RESULTS Decontamination efficacy of the wipes was initially tested on glass Petri dishes (150 mm diameter). Following exposure for a specified time of contact, survival of the spores was assessed by quantification of the remaining viable spores, both on the coupon surface and on the towelette itself, with efficacy quantified in terms of mean log reduction. Based on these data, five wipes were down-selected for evaluation on a larger scale, using 36 × 36 cm coupons of five different material types. CONCLUSIONS Results suggest that sodium hypochlorite-based sporicidal wipes were most effective, having completely inactivated the Bacillus spores on the glass Petri dish and several materials. Additionally, results demonstrate that the manufacturer-prescribed contact times for Clostridium difficile achieved a 6 log10 reduction of B. atrophaeus spores. Moreover, commercially available disinfecting wipes were not able to kill Bacillus spores as evaluated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY These data show the potential of sporicidal wipes for decontamination of small, contained areas of biological contamination and may help on-scene coordinators develop remediation plans following a biological terrorism event.","Meyer, K M; Tufts, J A; Calfee, M W; Oudejans, L",Journal of applied microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jam.12648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25220421/,615
101951,Answer to the editor's letter.,2020,"Importance The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has proven to be highly infectious, putting health care professionals around the world at increased risk. Furthermore, there are widespread shortages of necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) for these individuals. Filtering facepiece respirators, such as the N95 respirator, intended for single use, can be reused in times of need. We explore the evidence for decontamination or sterilization of N95 respirators for health care systems seeking to conserve PPE while maintaining the health of their workforce. Observations The filtration properties and fit of N95 respirators must be preserved to function adequately over multiple uses. Studies have shown that chemical sterilization using soap and water, alcohols, and bleach render the respirator nonfunctional. Decontamination with microwave heat and high dry heat also result in degradation of respirator material. UV light, steam, low-dry heat, and commercial sterilization methods with ethylene oxide or vaporized hydrogen peroxide appear to be viable options for successful decontamination. Furthermore, since the surface viability of the novel coronavirus is presumed to be 72 hours, rotating N95 respirator use and allowing time decontamination of the respirators is also a reasonable option. We describe a protocol and best practice recommendations for redoffing decontaminated N95 and rotating N95 respirator use. Conclusions and Relevance COVID-19 presents a high risk for health care professionals, particularly otolaryngologists, owing to the nature of viral transmission, including possible airborne transmission and high viral load in the upper respiratory tract. Proper PPE is effective when used correctly, but in times of scarce resources, institutions may turn to alternative methods of preserving and reusing filtering facepiece respirators. Based on studies conducted on the decontamination of N95 respirators after prior outbreaks, there are several options for institutions to consider for both immediate and large-scale implementation.","Su-Velez, Brooke M; Maxim, Tom; Long, Jennifer L; St John, Maie A; Holliday, Michael A",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2020.1423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32614377/,615
102842,Proposal for the management of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy in children.,2020,"BACKGROUND Rhodotorula glutinis is recognized as a biotechnologically important oleaginous red yeast, which synthesizes numerous meritorious compounds with wide industrial usages. One of the most notable properties of R. glutinis is the formation of intracellular lipid droplets full of carotenoids. However, the basic genomic features that underlie the biosynthesis of these valuable compounds in R. glutinis have not been fully documented. To reveal the biotechnological potential of R. glutinis, the genomics and lipidomics analysis was performed through the Next-Generation Sequencing and HPLC-MS-based metabolomics technologies. RESULTS Here, we firstly assemble the genome of R. glutinis ZHK into 21.8 Mb, containing 30 scaffolds and 6774 predicted genes with a N50 length of 14, 66,672 bp and GC content of 67.8%. Genome completeness assessment (BUSCO alignment: 95.3%) indicated the genome assembly with a high-quality features. According to the functional annotation of the genome, we predicted several key genes involved in lipids and carotenoids metabolism as well as certain industrial enzymes biosynthesis. Comparative genomics results suggested that most of orthologous genes have underwent the strong purifying selection within the five Rhodotorula species, especially genes responsible for carotenoids biosynthesis. Furthermore, a total of 982 lipids were identified using the lipidomics approaches, mainly including triacylglycerols, diacylglyceryltrimethylhomo-ser and phosphatidylethanolamine. CONCLUSION Using whole genome shotgun sequencing, we comprehensively analyzed the genome of R. glutinis and predicted several key genes involved in lipids and carotenoids metabolism. By performing comparative genomic analysis, we show that most of the ortholog genes have undergone strong purifying selection within the five Rhodotorula species. Furthermore, we identified 982 lipid species using lipidomic approaches. These results provided valuable resources to further advance biotechnological applications of R .glutinis.","Li, Chun-Ji; Zhao, Die; Cheng, Ping; Zheng, Li; Yu, Guo-Hui",BMC genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-07244-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243144/,615

This study reports the preliminary findings of the first known human case of H5N6 in Yunnan province. The patient initially developed symptoms of sore throat and coughing on 27 January 2015. The disease rapidly progressed to severe pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunctions and acute respiratory distress syndrome and the patient died on 6 February. Virological analysis determined that the virus belonged to H5 clade 2.3.4.4 and it has obtained partial ability for mammalian adaptation and amantadine resistance. Environmental investigation found H5 in 63% of the samples including poultry faeces, tissues, cage surface swabs and sewage from local live poultry markets by real-time RT-PCR. These findings suggest that the expanding and enhancing of surveillance in both avian and humans are necessary to monitor the evolution of H5 influenza virus and to facilitate early detection of suspected cases.","Xu, Wen; Li, Hong; Jiang, Li",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.3109/23744235.2015.1135253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27030920/,615

Natural compounds with antioxidant activity may provide a preventive measure against infection. Tea polyphenols were evaluated for their ability to inhibit enterovirus 71 (EV71) replication in Vero cell culture. Among the polyphenolic compounds tested, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and gallocatechin gallate (GCG) potently inhibited replication of EV71. EGCG and GCG reduced the titer of infectious progeny virus by 95%. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis also revealed that EGCG suppressed replication of genomic RNA. It was accompanied by an increased cytoprotective effect. EGCG and GCG caused 5-fold increase in the viability of EV71-infected cells. The viral inhibitory effect correlated well with the antioxidant capacity of polyphenol. Mechanistically, EV71 infection led to increased oxidative stress, as shown by increased dichlorofluorescein and MitoSOX Red fluorescence. Upon EGCG treatment, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was significantly reduced. Consistent with this, EV71 replication was enhanced in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient cells, and such enhancement was largely reversed by EGCG. These findings suggest that EGCG may suppress viral replication via modulation of cellular redox milieu.","Ho, Hung-Yao; Cheng, Mei-Ling; Weng, Shiue-Fen; Leu, Yann-Lii; Chiu, Daniel Tsun-Yee",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/jf901128u; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19537794/,615

This scoping review identifies studies of interventions to increase uptake of cervical screening among women in the region and uses the Integrated Behavioral Model (IBM) to describe how interventions might work. METHODS A systematic search of literature was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and CINAHL databases through May 2019. Screening and data charting were performed by two independent reviewers. Intervention studies measuring changes to uptake in screening among women in SSA were included, with no restriction to intervention type, study setting or date, or participant characteristics. Intervention type and implementation strategies were described using behavioral constructs from the IBM. RESULTS Of the 3704 citations the search produced, 19 studies were selected for inclusion. Most studies were published between 2014 and 2019 (78.9%) and were set in Nigeria (47.4%) and South Africa (26.3%). Studies most often assessed screening with Pap smears (31.6%) and measured uptake as ever screened (42.1%) or screened during the study period (36.8%). Education-based interventions were most common (57.9%) and the IBM construct of knowledge/skills to perform screening was targeted most frequently (68.4%). Willingness to screen was high, before and after intervention. Screening coverage ranged from 1.7 to 99.2% post-intervention, with six studies (31.6%) reporting a significant improvement in screening that achieved ≥60% coverage. CONCLUSIONS Educational interventions were largely ineffective, except those that utilized peer or community health educators and mHealth implementation strategies. Two economic incentivization interventions were moderately effective, by acting on participants' instrumental attitudes, but resulted in screening coverage less than 20%. Innovative service delivery, including community-based self-sampling, acted on environmental constraints, striving to make services more available, accessible, and appropriate to women, and were the most effective. This review demonstrates that intent to perform screening may not be the major determinant of screening behavior, suggesting other theoretical frameworks may be needed to more fully understand uptake of cervical screening in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly for health systems change interventions.","Lott, Breanne E; Trejo, Mario J; Baum, Christina; McClelland, D Jean; Adsul, Prajakta; Madhivanan, Purnima; Carvajal, Scott; Ernst, Kacey; Ehiri, John",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-08777-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393218/,615

120738,"Vulnerability to severe forms of COVID-19: an intra-municipal analysis in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.",2020,"BACKGROUND An estimated 10 million people are incarcerated internationally, including 2.1 million people in the United States. Criminal justice involvement is a social determinant of individual and family health disparities. Health care in correctional and forensic psychiatric facilities is nurse driven. The unique contributions of nurse authors to the research literature on health equity and humane conditions for this population have not been aggregated, nor have the nursing research gaps in this area been systematically identified. This article determines the volume and country location of nurse-authored research in this area and analyzes the research by population (prisons, jails, community supervision, forensic psychiatry), clinical foci, and research methods. METHODS We conducted an integrative review of research literature published in English between 1990 and 2017. RESULTS Our search revealed 283 data-based articles written by 349 nurse authors, representing Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South Americas. Most research occurred in prisons (53.3%) and focused on mental health/substance use (32.5%), infectious disease (21.6%), or correctional health services (15.6%). Almost one third of articles across clinical foci sampled nurses, not patients. IMPLICATIONS Although there is clearly a cadre of nurse researchers working in this area, it remains a relatively small group focused most closely on mental health, infectious disease, and the correctional nursing experience. Gaps and opportunities for important nursing contributions remain, especially in reproductive health, meeting the needs of community-supervised people, and explicitly connecting this work with its human rights implications.","Goshin, Lorie S; Colbert, Alison M; Carey, John F",Journal of forensic nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/jfn.0000000000000193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29697521/,615

Single cases and small series were reported from 13 countries, the majority from Europe (79.4%) and especially from Italy (30.9%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was demonstrated by nasopharyngeal swab (85.7%) and serology (14.3%). Median time between COVID-19 and GBS onset in 36 patients was 11.5 days (IQR: 7.7-16). The most common clinical features were: limb weakness (76.2%), hypoareflexia (80.9 %), sensory disturbances (66.7 %) and facial palsy (38.1%). Dysautonomia occurred in 19%, respiratory failure in 33.3% and 40.5% of patients were admitted in intensive care unit. Most patients (71.4%) had the classical clinical presentation but virtually all GBS variants and subtypes were reported. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) albumin-cytological dissociation was found in 28/36 (77.8%) and PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative in 25/25 patients. Electrodiagnosis was demyelinating in 80.5% and levels 1 and 2 of Brighton criteria of diagnostic certainty, when applicable, were fulfilled in 94.5% patients. Antiganglioside antibodies were positive in only 1/22 patients. Treatments were intravenous immunoglobulin and/or plasma exchange (92.8%) with, at short-time follow-up, definite improvement or recovery in 62.1% of patients. One patient died. In conclusion, the most frequent phenotype of GBS in SARS-CoV-2 infection is the classical sensorimotor demyelinating GBS responding to the usual treatments. The time interval between infectious and neuropathic symptoms, absence of CSF pleocytosis and negative PCR support a postinfectious mechanism. The abundance of reports suggests a pathogenic link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and GBS but a case-control study is greatly needed.","Uncini, Antonino; Vallat, Jean-Michel; Jacobs, Bart C","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2020-324491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32855289/,615

For accurate quality control and bioactivity assessment of Sphaerophysa salsula, a rapid and productive method to isolate flavonoid glycosides is needed. Therefore, this work reports the development of a novel comprehensive strategy based on an online middle-pressure chromatography and preparative HPLC for rapid enrichment and separation of flavonoid glycosides from Sphaerophysa salsula. First, the flavonoid glycosides were enriched using an online middle-pressure chromatographic column containing stationary MCI phase. During this process, the high-volume injection of the extracting solution was realized by an empty pre-column positioned before the main chromatographic tower. Then, the compounds were separated through preparative HPLC with Megress C18. As a result, one new flavonol 3-O-glycoside (2) together with two known flavonol 3-O-glycosides (1, 3) were targetedly isolated from Sphaerophysa salsula. The content of compounds 1-3 in Sphaerophysa salsula was 0.09, 0.11, and 0.18 wt%, respectively.

This scoping review focused on answering key questions about the focus, quality and generalisability of the quantitative evidence on the determinants of adherence to social distancing measures in research during the first wave of COVID-19. METHODS This scoping review is pre-registered with Open Science Framework, and the protocol has been published. Literature searches were conducted using online databases and grey literature sources. Screening, data extraction and quality appraisal was conducted by members of the research team, with discrepancies resolved by consensus discussion. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Cochrane's ROBINS-I tool, the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. The potential determinants of adherence to social distancing measures examined in the included studies were coded to domains and constructs of the Theoretical Domains Framework. RESULTS The review included 84 studies. The majority of included studies were conducted in Western Europe and the USA. Many lacked theoretical input, were at risk for bias, and few were experimental in design. The most commonly coded domains of the TDF in the included studies were 'Environmental Context and Resources' (388 codes across 76 studies), 'Beliefs about Consequences' (34 codes across 21 studies), 'Emotion' (28 codes across 12 studies), and 'Social Influences' (26 codes across 16 studies). The least frequently coded TDF domains included 'Optimism' (not coded), 'Intentions' (coded once), 'Goals' (2 codes across 2 studies), 'Reinforcement' (3 codes across 2 studies), and 'Behavioural Regulation' (3 codes across 3 studies).

METHOD Cross-sectional study that analyzes the number of visits to Spanish public EDs, reported through a survey of ED chiefs during the study periods. Changes in healthcare activity were described in each autonomous community and com-pared according to hospital size and the provincial impact of the pandemic. RESULTS A total of 187 (66?%) of the 283 Spanish EDs participated in the study. The total number of patients attended de-creased to 49.2?% (<?30?% in the Castilla-La Mancha region), with a 60?% reduction in non-COVID-19 patients (reduction <?50?% in the regions of Asturias and Extremadura).

Strategies have been developed to improve vaccines' performance in terms of broadly reactive and long-lasting immune response induction. AREAS COVERED We have summarized the advancements in the development of cross-protective influenza vaccines and discussed the challenges in evaluating them in preclinical and clinical trials. Here, the literature regarding the current stage of development of universal influenza vaccine candidates was reviewed. EXPERT COMMENTARY Although various strategies aim to redirect adaptive immune responses from variable immunodominant to immunosubdominant antigens, more conserved epitopes are being investigated. Approaches that improve antibody responses to conserved B cell epitopes have increased the protective efficacy of vaccines within a subtype or phylogenetic group of influenza viruses. Vaccines that elicit significant levels of T cells recognizing highly conserved viral epitopes possess a high cross-protective potential and may cover most circulating influenza viruses. However, the development of T cell-based universal influenza vaccines is challenging owing to the diversity of MHCs in the population, unpredictable degree of immunodominance, lack of adequate animal models, and difficulty in establishing T cell immunity in humans.","Isakova-Sivak, Irina; Stepanova, Ekaterina; Mezhenskaya, Daria; Matyushenko, Victoria; Prokopenko, Polina; Sychev, Ivan; Wong, Pei-Fong; Rudenko, Larisa",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1964961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34348561/,615

134940,Concurrent SPECT/PET-CT imaging as a method for tracking adoptively transferred T-cells in vivo.,2016,"Electroconductive hydrogels (ECHs) are highly hydrated 3D networks generated through the incorporation of conductive polymers, nanoparticles, and other conductive materials into polymeric hydrogels. ECHs combine several advantageous properties of inherently conductive materials with the highly tunable physical and biochemical properties of hydrogels. Recently, the development of biocompatible ECHs has been investigated for various biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, biosensors, flexible electronics, and other implantable medical devices. Several methods for the synthesis of ECHs have been reported, which include the incorporation of electrically conductive materials such as gold and silver nanoparticles, graphene, and carbon nanotubes, as well as various conductive polymers (CPs), such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxyythiophene) into hydrogel networks. Theses electroconductive composite hydrogels can be used as scaffolds with high swellability, tunable mechanical properties, and the capability to support cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, recent advancements in microfabrication techniques such as three dimensional (3D) bioprinting, micropatterning, and electrospinning have led to the development of ECHs with biomimetic microarchitectures that reproduce the characteristics of the native extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition, smart ECHs with controlled structures and healing properties have also been engineered into devices with prolonged half-lives and increased durability. The combination of sophisticated synthesis chemistries and modern microfabrication techniques have led to engineer smart ECHs with advanced architectures, geometries, and functionalities that are being increasingly used in drug delivery systems, biosensors, tissue engineering, and soft electronics. In this review, we will summarize different strategies to synthesize conductive biomaterials. We will also discuss the advanced microfabrication techniques used to fabricate ECHs with complex 3D architectures, as well as various biomedical applications of microfabricated ECHs.","Walker, Brian W; Lara, Roberto Portillo; Mogadam, Emad; Yu, Chu Hsiang; Kimball, William; Annabi, Nasim",Progress in polymer science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2019.02.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831422/,615

138262,The healthcare and pharmaceutical vulnerability emerging from the new Coronavirus outbreak.,2020-05-01,"OBJECTIVES to estimate the population prevalence of COVID-19-like symptoms in children and adults during the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave hitting Italy in the spring 2020; to assess their geographical correlation with the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases by province; to analyse their clustering within families; to estimate their sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for COVID-19 diagnosis in individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN cross-sectional study nested within a birth cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS mothers participating in an Italian birth cohort (NINFEA) were invited to complete an online questionnaire on COVID-19-like symptoms in their household. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES population prevalence of COVID-19-like symptoms in children and adults, geographical correlation of COVID-19-like symptoms with the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases by province, clustering of COVID-19-like symptoms within families, and sensitivity, PPV and NPV of COVID-19-like symptoms for COVID-19 diagnosis in individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS information was collected on 3,184 households, 6,133 adults, and 5,751 children. In the period March-April 2020, 55.4% of the NINFEA families had at least one member with at least one COVID-19-like symptom. There was a strong geographical correlation between the population cumulative incidence of COVID-19 and the prevalence of muscle pain, fatigue, low-grade fever, and breathing difficulties in adults (Spearman's rho >=0.70). Having at least one family member with a COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with none tested for SARS-CoV-2, was associated with an increased prevalence ratio (PR) of almost all COVID-19-like symptoms in adults, and only of low-grade fever (37-37.5°C; PR 4.54; 95%CI 2.20-9.40) and anosmia/dysgeusia in children. Among adults with COVID-19 diagnosis, fatigue, muscle pain, and fever had a sensitivity >=70%. In individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, with a 16.6% prevalence of COVID-19, breathing difficulties and nausea/vomiting had the highest PPVs, with point estimates close to 60%, and with NPVs close to 90%. CONCLUSIONS the geographical prevalence of COVID-19-like symptoms in adults may inform on local disease clusters, while certain symptoms in family members of confirmed COVID-19 cases could help identify the intra-familial spread of the virus and its further propagation in the community. Low-grade fever is frequent in children with at least one household member with COVID-19 and possibly indicates child infection.","Popovic, Maja; Moccia, Chiara; Isaevska, Elena; Moirano, Giovenale; Pizzi, Costanza; Zugna, Daniela; Rusconi, Franca; Merletti, Franco; Maule, Milena; Richiardi, Lorenzo",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep21.6.093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34545726/,615

However, little is known about the role of urinary ACE2 (UACE2) in diabetes. The present study was performed to evaluate UACE2 levels in type 2 diabetic patients with various degrees of albuminuria and its associations with metabolic parameters. The effect of RAS inhibitors on UACE2 excretion was also assessed. METHODS A total of 132 type 2 diabetic patients with different degrees of albuminuria and 34 healthy volunteers were studied. UACE2 levels and activity were measured. RESULTS Compared to healthy controls, UACE2 to creatinine (UACE2/Cr) levels were significantly increased in both albuminuric and non-albuminuric diabetic patients. UACE2/Cr levels were much higher in hypertensive diabetic patients compared with their normotensive counterparts and treatment with RAS inhibitors markedly attenuated the augmentation. Furthermore, UACE2/Cr was positively correlated with fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), triglyceride, and total cholesterol. In multiple regression analysis, UACE2/Cr was independently predicted by HbA1C and RAS inhibitors treatment. CONCLUSIONS UACE2 increased in type 2 diabetic patients with various degrees of albuminuria and RAS inhibitors suppresses UACE2 excretion. UACE2 might potentially function as a marker for monitoring the metabolic status and therapeutic response of RAS inhibitors in diabetes.","Liang, Yaoxian; Deng, Hui; Bi, Shuhong; Cui, Zhuan; A, Lata; Zheng, Danxia; Wang, Yue",Kidney & blood pressure research,https://doi.org/10.1159/000368486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25791940/,615

As we begin to recover from the pandemic, a cohesive international approach is needed, and guidance on how to resume endoscopy services safely to avoid unintended harm from diagnostic delays. The aim of these guidelines is to provide consensus recommendations that clinicians can use to facilitate the swift and safe resumption of endoscopy services. An evidence-based literature review was carried out on the various strategies used globally to manage endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic and control infection. A modified Delphi process involving international endoscopy experts was used to agree on the consensus statements. A threshold of 80% agreement was used to establish consensus for each statement. 27 of 30 statements achieved consensus after two rounds of voting by 34 experts. The statements were categorised as pre-endoscopy, during endoscopy and postendoscopy addressing relevant areas of practice, such as screening, personal protective equipment, appropriate environments for endoscopy and infection control precautions, particularly in areas of high disease prevalence. Recommendations for testing of patients and for healthcare workers, appropriate locations of donning and doffing areas and social distancing measures before endoscopy are unique and not dealt with by any other guidelines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Bipolar electrosurgical forceps were used for haemostasis in 3744 open surgeries including ovariectomies in bitches (n=1406) and queens (n=859) and castrations in dogs (n=1335). The forceps were also used to assist with ovariohysterectomy in bitches (n=89) and queens (n=55). The effect of bipolar electrocoagulation and other likely factors influencing surgical time was examined using linear regression analysis of 367 surgeries. RESULTS The use of the forceps reduced surgical time by 9·7 ±2·8 minutes in bitches and by 3·0 ±1·5 minutes in queens. The complications encountered initially were small superficial skin burns requiring topical treatment and one case of haemorrhage associated with surgical technique. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Bipolar electrosurgical forceps reduce surgical time in ovariectomies, and complications are rare. This technique has promise for widespread application in veterinary practice to assist with haemostasis in ovariectomy of bitches and queens.","Watts, J",The Journal of small animal practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/jsap.12838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29608797/,615

The demand for scalable, rapid and sensitive viral diagnostics is thus particularly pressing at present to help contain the rapid spread of infection and prevent overwhelming the capacity of health systems. While high-income countries have managed to rapidly expand diagnostic capacities, such is not the case in resource-limited settings of low- to medium-income countries. Aiming at developing cost-effective viral load detection systems for point-of-care COVID-19 diagnostics in resource-limited and resource-rich settings alike, we report the development of an integrated modular centrifugal microfluidic platform to perform loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of viral RNA directly from heat-inactivated nasopharyngeal swab samples. The discs were pre-packed with dried n-benzyl-n-methylethanolamine modified agarose beads used to selectively remove primer dimers, inactivate the reaction post-amplification and allowing enhanced fluorescence detection via a smartphone camera. Sample-to-answer analysis within 1 hour from sample collection and a detection limit of approximately 100 RNA copies in 10 μL reaction volume were achieved. The platform was validated with a panel of 162 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from patients with COVID-19 symptoms, providing a sensitivity of 96.6% (82.2-99.9%, 95% CI) for samples with Ct values below 26 and a specificity of 100% (90-100%, 95% CI), thus being fit-for-purpose to diagnose patients with a high risk of viral transmission.

This study reports the incidence and clinical outcomes of acute reocclusion of arteries following emergent intracranial angioplasty with or without stent placement for the management of patients with acute stroke with underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-six patients with acute stroke received emergent intracranial angioplasty with or without stent placement for intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis and underwent follow-up head CTA. Acute reocclusion was defined as ""hypoattenuation"" within an arterial segment with discrete discontinuation of the arterial contrast column, both proximal and distal to the hypoattenuated lesion, on CTA performed before discharge. Angioplasty was defined as ""suboptimal"" if a residual stenosis of ≥50% was detected on the postprocedural angiography. Clinical and radiologic data of patients with and without reocclusion were compared. RESULTS Of the 46 patients, 29 and 17 underwent angioplasty with and without stent placement, respectively. Acute reocclusion was observed in 6 patients (13%) and was more frequent among those with suboptimal angioplasty than among those without it (71.4% versus 2.6%, P < .001). The relative risk of acute reocclusion in patients with suboptimal angioplasty was 27.857 (95% confidence interval, 3.806-203.911). Furthermore, a good outcome was significantly less frequent in patients with acute reocclusion than in those without it (16.7% versus 67.5%, P = .028). CONCLUSIONS Acute reocclusion of treated arteries was common after emergent intracranial angioplasty with or without stent placement in patients with acute stroke with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis and was associated with a poor outcome. Suboptimal results of angioplasty appear to be associated with acute reocclusion, irrespective of whether stent placement was performed.","Kim, G E; Yoon, W; Kim, S K; Kim, B C; Heo, T W; Baek, B H; Lee, Y Y; Yim, N Y",AJNR.

162366,Claiming and Expanding Social Work Knowledge in the International Space,2021,"We present a convolutional neural network (CNN) equipped with a novel and efficient adaptive dual attention module (ADAM) for automated skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopic images, which is an essential yet challenging step for the development of a computer-assisted skin disease diagnosis system. The proposed ADAM has three compelling characteristics. First, we integrate two global context modeling mechanisms into the ADAM, one aiming at capturing the boundary continuity of skin lesion by global average pooling while the other dealing with the shape irregularity by pixel-wise correlation. In this regard, our network, thanks to the proposed ADAM, is capable of extracting more comprehensive and discriminative features for recognizing the boundary of skin lesions. Second, the proposed ADAM supports multi-scale resolution fusion, and hence can capture multi-scale features to further improve the segmentation accuracy. Third, as we harness a spatial information weighting method in the proposed network, our method can reduce a lot of redundancies compared with traditional CNNs. The proposed network is implemented based on a dual encoder architecture, which is able to enlarge the receptive field without greatly increasing the network parameters. In addition, we assign different dilation rates to different ADAMs so that it can adaptively capture distinguishing features according to the size of a lesion. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on both ISBI2017 and ISIC2018 datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that, without using network ensemble schemes, our method is capable of achieving better segmentation performance than state-of-the-art deep learning models, particularly those equipped with attention mechanisms.","Wu, Huisi; Pan, Junquan; Li, Zhuoying; Wen, Zhenkun; Qin, Jing",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2020.3027341; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32986547/,615

Advancement in the areas of AI, edge computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and fast communication networks provided by beyond 5G (B5G) networks has opened doors for new possibilities by fusing these technologies and techniques. In a pandemic outbreak, such as COVID-19, the need for rapid analysis, decision making, and prediction of future trends becomes paramount.

164959,Social Work Educators’ Opportunities During COVID-19: A Roadmap for Trauma-Informed Teaching During Crisis,2021,"Summary Background: The emerging threat represented by SARS-CoV-2 variants, demands the development of therapies for better clinical management of COVID-19. MAD0004J08 is an extremely potent Fc-engineered monoclonal antibody (mAb) able to neutralise in vitro all current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs). This ongoing study, evaluates safety, pharmacokinetics and SARS-CoV-2 sera neutralization effect of MAD0004J08 when administered as single dose intramuscularly in healthy adults. Method: We conducted a dose escalation study with sequential enrolment of three cohorts, each with an increasing dose level of MAD0004J08 (48mg, 100mg and 400mg). Within each cohort, 10 young healthy adults were randomized with 4:1 ratio to a single intramuscular (i.m.) injection of MAD0004J08 or placebo. The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with severe and/or serious treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) within 7 days post-treatment. Secondary endpoints reported in this paper are the proportion of subjects with solicited TEAEs up 7 days post dosing, MAD0004J08 serum concentrations and neutralising activity versus the original SARS-COV-2 Wuhan virus at different timepoints post-dosing. As post-hoc analyses, we compared the sera neutralising titres of subjects who received MAD0004J08 with those of people that had received the COVID-19 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in the previous sixty days (n=10) and COVID-19 convalescent patients (n=20), and assessed serum neutralisation activity against the B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Findings: A total of 30 subjects, 10 per cohort, were enrolled and randomized. Data up to 30 days were available and analysed in this report. No severe TEAEs were reported in any of the cohorts in the 7 days post-treatment. MAD0004J08 was detected in the sera of treated subjects within few hours post-administration and reached almost maximal levels on day 8. The geometric mean neutralising titres (GMT) assessed against the original Wuhan virus peaked on day 8 and ranged 226 - 905, 905 - 2,560, and 1,280 - 5,120 for cohort 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The sera neutralising GMT in MAD0004J08 treated subjects in all the three cohorts were found to be 1{middle dot}5- 54{middle dot}5-fold higher compared to sera from convalescent patients and 1{middle dot}83- 76{middle dot}4-fold higher compared to sera from COVID-19 vaccinees. Finally, GMT in MAD0004J08 treated subjects showed high neutralising titres versus the B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) SARS-CoV-2 VoCs. Interpretation: A single dose administration of MAD0004J08 via i.m. route is safe and well tolerated and results in a rapid systemic distribution of the MAD0004J08 and sera neutralising titres higher than COVID-19 convalescent and vaccinated subjects. A single dose administration of MAD0004J08 is also sufficient to effectively neutralise major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Based on these results, a Phase 2-3 trial is ongoing to further assess the safety, dosage, and efficacy of MAD0004J08 in asymptomatic or mild-moderate symptomatic COVID-19 patients.

It has seldom been used in diabetes health services research. Our objectives were to describe the process and challenges of conducting a patient-engagement project and to highlight the experiences of patient participants and academic researchers. Research Design & Methods: We recruited PWLEH and diabetes in Toronto, Canada to be patient partners. Group members were asked to commit to attending biweekly meetings. We undertook two major research projects: Concept mapping to choose a research focus; and photovoice to explore accessing healthy food while homeless. We used a convergent mixed methods design to evaluate their experience. Results: A diverse group of 8 PWLEH had an average attendance of 82% over 21 meetings, despite this success, we encountered a number of challenges to conducting this research. Group members reported that participation improved their ability to be self-advocates in their diabetes care and provided them with tangible skills and social benefits. Group members stated that they valued being involved in all aspects of the research, in particular knowledge translation activities, including advocating for nutritious food at shelters; presenting to stakeholders; and meeting with policy makers. Conclusions: The use of participatory patient engagement research methods enables academic researchers to support community members in pursuing research that is pertinent to them and which has a positive impact. In our study, group members contributed in meaningful ways and also valued the experience.","Campbell, D. J. T.; Campbell, R. B.; DiGiandomenico, A.; Larsen, M.; Davidson, M. A.; McBrien, K.

METHODS: We searched in Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus databases with keywords of ""COVID-19"", ""children"", ""mothers"", ""health"", ""impact"", ""effect"", and ""pandemic"". We found 33 related new studies and wrote a narrative review article. Some of them were full-text articles and others were organizational statistics or expert comments. RESULTS: Analyses showed that the COVID-19 epidemic led to widespread disruption of health systems and reduced access to food, and low- and middle-income countries should expect large increases in maternal and child mortality. The long-term effects of COVID-19 on the physical and mental health of children and mothers are very different and challenging compared to other people. During the pandemic, many mothers denied access to prenatal care. In addition to the many indirect effects, although most children have mild symptoms, they should be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) if children are hospitalized with the same percentage of adults. CONCLUSION: It is very necessary for politicians and organizations in charge of children's health to have comprehensive and long-term plans to limit the destructive and unintended effects of the pandemic on children and mothers around the world, with a greater focus on underdeveloped and less developed countries.","Chegini, V.; Parsarad, E.; Rouhi, S.",Chronic Diseases Journal,https://doi.org/10.22122/cdj.v9i2.602,615
167582,Effectiveness of the flipped classroom model on students’ self-reported motivation and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Infecting large portions of the global population, seasonal influenza is a major burden on societies around the globe. While the global source sink dynamics of the different seasonal influenza viruses have been studied intensively, it’s local spread remains less clear. In order to improve our understanding of how influenza is transmitted on a city scale, we collected an extremely densely sampled set of influenza sequences alongside patient metadata. To do so, we sequenced influenza viruses isolated from patients of two different hospitals, as well as private practitioners in Basel, Switzerland during the 2016/2017 influenza season. The genetic sequences reveal that repeated introductions into the city drove the influenza season. We then reconstruct how the effective reproduction number changed over the course of the season. We find trends in transmission dynamics correlated positively with trends in temperature, but not relative humidity nor school holidays. Alongside the genetic sequence data that allows us to see how individual cases are connected, we gathered patient information, such as the age or household status. Zooming into the local transmission outbreaks suggests that the elderly were to a large extent infected within their own transmission network, while school children likely drove the spread within the remaining transmission network. These patterns will be valuable to plan interventions combating the spread of respiratory diseases within cities given that similar patterns are observed for other influenza seasons and cities. Author summary As shown with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, respiratory diseases can quickly spread around the globe. While it can be hugely important to understand how diseases spread around the globe, local spread is most often the main driver of novel infections of respiratory diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 or influenza. We here use genetic sequence data alongside patient information to better understand what the drives the local spread of influenza by looking at the 2016/2017 influenza season in Basel, Switzerland as an example. The genetic sequence data allows us to reconstruct the how the transmission dynamics changed over the course of the season, which we correlate to changes, but not humidity or school holidays. Additionally, the genetic sequence data allows us to see how individual cases are connected. Using patient information, such as age and household status our analyses suggest that the elderly mainly transmit within their own transmission network. Additionally, they suggest that school aged children, but not pre-school aged children are important drivers of the local spread of influenza.","Müller, Nicola F.; Wüthrich, Daniel; Goldman, Nina; Sailer, Nadine; Saalfrank, Claudia; Brunner, Myrta; Augustin, Noémi; Seth-Smith, Helena MB; Hollenstein, Yvonne; Syedbasha, Mohammedyaseen; Lang, Daniela; Neher, Richard A.; Dubuis, Olivier; Naegele, Michael; Buser, Andreas; Nickel, Christian H.; Ritz, Nicole; Zeller, Andreas; Lang, Brian M.; Hadfield, James; Bedford, Trevor; Battegay, Manuel; Schneider-Sliwa, Rita; Egli, Adrian; Stadler, Tanja",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.052225,615

Knee surgery (including arthroscopy) is one of the emerging surgical services in Indonesia. As the pandemic goes on, some of the patients prefer to postpone or cancel the surgery planning. AIM: We tried to evaluate the epidemiology of knee arthroscopy procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic at our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective data collection was performed on all patients who received knee arthroscopy procedures at Prof Dr. R. Soeharso Orthopaedic Hospital, Surakarta, Indonesia during the year 2020. The study evaluated the demographic data, the indication of surgery, and trends of the number of surgeries according to period time. This study also compared the data of knee arthroscopy procedures performed during the corresponding period before the pandemic in Indonesia (January to December 2019). RESULTS: There was a total of 88 knee arthroscopy surgery performed during the period January to December 2020. There was a decrease in the number of knee arthroscopy during April and May 2020. The decreasing number of surgeries also occurred in November 2020 which was later followed by the increasing number of surgeries in December 2020. Among all patient received knee arthroscopy during 2020, none have post-operative complication or infection due to SARS-Cov-2. CONCLUSION: There was some difference in the epidemiology of knee arthroscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the non-pandemic era. Comprehensive preoperative screening is needed before resume elective surgical service.","Santoso, A.; Anwar, I. B.; Sibarani, T. S. M. H. S.; Utomo, P.; Arimukti, Z.; Yudistiro, I.; Hamid, M.

Yet, most previous work on thermal niches has ignored detailed mechanistic information about the relationship between temperature and organismal performance, which can be described by a thermal performance curve. Here, we develop a model that predicts the width of thermal performance curves will be narrower in the presence of interspecific competitors, causing a species’ optimal breeding temperature to diverge from that of a competitor. We test this prediction in the Asian burying beetle Nicrophorus nepalensis, confirming that the divergence in actual and optimal breeding temperatures is the result of competition with blowflies. However, we further show that intraspecific cooperation enables beetles to outcompete blowflies by recovering their optimal breeding temperature. Ultimately, linking direct (abiotic factors) and indirect effects (biotic interactions) on niche width will be critical for understanding species-specific responses to climate change.","Tsai, Hsiang-Yu; Rubenstein, Dustin R.; Chen, Bo-Fei; Liu, Mark; Chan, Shih-Fan; Chen, De-Pei; Sun, Syuan-Jyun; Yuan, Tzu-Neng; Shen, Sheng-Feng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.075325,615

We assessed and compared the contribution of computed tomography (CT)-derived muscle status and lung parenchymal features in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods or Background: Clinical/laboratory data and clinical outcomes (intensive care unit [ICU] admission and death) were retrieved retrospectively for patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction who underwent chest CT on admission in four hospitals in northern Italy from February 21 to April 30, 2020. Extent and type of pulmonary involvement, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion were assessed. Cross-sectional areas and attenuation of paravertebral muscles were measured on axial CT images at the T5 and T12 vertebral levels. Multivariate linear and binary logistic regression were used to find associations between variables in predicting ICU admission or death and to obtain predictive models, including odds ratios (ORs), tested and compared using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Results or Findings: A total of 552 patients (364 men;median age: 65 years;interquartile range: 54-75) were included. In a CT-based model (including lung and muscle status), reduced paravertebral muscle area at the T5 level showed the highest ORs for ICU admission (4.83;p < .001) and death (2.25;p = .027). When this model was extended to include clinical variables, reduced paravertebral muscle area at the T5 level still showed the highest ORs both for ICU admission (4.34;p < .001) and death (2.28;p = .001). At ROC analysis comparing these models, the chest CT-based model had the same area under the curve (AUC) for ICU admission prediction (0.83;p = .380) and a nonsignificantly lower AUC for death prediction (0.86 versus 0.87;p =. 282). Conclusion: The combination of CT-derived lung parenchymal features and muscle status allowed us to predict outcomes reliably of COVID-19 patients, without a relevant contribution from clinical variables.","Albano, D.; Schiaffino, S.; Cozzi, A.; Messina, C.; Gitto, S.; Vanzulli, A.; Carriero, A.; Sardanelli, F.; Sconfienza, L.

We aim to produce self-explanatory questions that focus on main document topics and are answerable with variable length passages as appropriate. We satisfy these requirements by using a BERT-based Pointer-Generator Network trained on the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset. Our model shows SOTA performance of SQ generation on the NQ dataset (20.1 BLEU-4).

Through a qualitative and exploratory case study of a Portuguese logistic operator, we explored the effects of the pandemic on employeeś daily work. To that end, we used several sources of data collection, such as semi-structured interviews, analysis of official documents and direct observation. The results showed that the logistic operator is adopting several measures and practices to mitigate the effects of COVID-19, such as: 1) use of telework;2) protection and hygiene measures for employees and customers;3) tools to respond to growing demand for non-perishable goods, hygiene/cleaning products and tobacco;4) policies that enhance digital transformation;and, 5) the use of active and preventive communication strategies. Of all the adopted measures, we highlight the digital transformation, due to its potential positive impact in allowing the return of a new normal. This normality is largely achieved by the use of innovative technologies that allowed remote work in practically all departments of the organization. This organizational change improved the paradigm we were used to, as it allowed to build new beliefs regarding the positive impact of teleworking and other opportunities for remote work, without significantly changing the expected service levels. In short, this article contributes to the dissemination of measures and practices adopted by retailers in Portugal, without neglecting the safety and competitiveness of labor practices. © 2021 AISTI.","Lopes, M.; Reis, J.","16th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies, CISTI 2021",https://doi.org/10.23919/cisti52073.2021.9476594,615
171407,Failure mode and effect analysis: A technique to prevent the risk of sars-cov-2 infectionin a retrocession unit,2021,"In 2020, the dominant greenhouse gases stored in Earth’s atmosphere continued to increase. The annual global average carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration at Earth’s surface was 412.5 ± 0.1 ppm, an increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm over 2019, and the highest in the modern instrumental record and in ice core records dating back 800,000 years. While anthropogenic CO2 emissions were estimated to decrease around 6%–7% globally during the year due to reduced human activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, the reduction did not materially affect atmospheric CO2 accumulation as it is a relatively small change, less even than interannual variability driven by the terrestrial biosphere. The net global uptake of ~3.0 petagrams of anthropogenic carbon by oceans in 2020 was the highest in the 39-year record and almost 30% higher than the 1999–2019 average. Weak El Niño-like conditions in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean in early 2020 cooled and transitioned to a moderate La Niña later in the year. Even so, the annual global surface temperature across land and oceans was among the three highest in records dating to the mid- to late 1800s. In Europe, 17 countries reported record high annual mean temperatures, contributing to the warmest year on record for the European continent. Elsewhere, Japan, Mexico, and Seychelles also experienced record high annual mean temperatures. In the Caribbean, Aruba, Martinique, and St. Lucia reported their all-time monthly maximum temperatures. In the United States, Furnace Creek in Death Valley, California, reached 54.4°C on 16 August—the hottest temperature measured on Earth since 1931, pending confirmation. North of 60°N, the annual mean temperature over Arctic land areas was 2.1°C above the 1981–2010 average, the highest in the 121-year record. On 20 June, a temperature of 38°C was observed at Verkhoyansk, Russia (67.6°N), provisionally the highest temperature ever measured within the Arctic Circle. Near the opposite pole, an atmospheric river—a long, narrow region in the atmosphere that transports heat and moisture from sub-tropical and midlatitudes—brought extreme warmth from sub-tropical and midlatitudes to parts of Antarctica during austral summer. On 6 February, Esperanza Station recorded a temperature of 18.3°C, the highest temperature recorded on the continent, surpassing the previous record set in 2015 by 1.1°C. The warmth also led to the largest late-summer surface melt event in the 43-year record, affecting more than 50% of the Antarctic Peninsula. In August, daily sea ice extent in the waters surrounding Antarctica shifted from below to above average, marking the end of persistent below-average sea ice extent since austral spring 2016. In the Arctic, when sea ice reached its annual maximum extent in March, thin, first-year ice comprised ~70% of the ice;the thickest ice, which is usually more than four years old, had declined by more than 86% since 1985 to make up just 2% of total ice in 2020. When the minimum sea ice extent was reached in September, it was the second smallest except for 2012 in the 42-year satellite record. The Northern Sea Route along the Siberian coast was open for about 2.5 months, from late July through mid-October, compared to less than a month typically. Glaciers across the global cryosphere lost mass for the 33rd consecutive year, and permafrost temperatures continued to reach record highs at many high latitude and mountain locations. In the Northern Hemisphere, lakes froze three days later and thawed 5.5 days earlier on average. In Finland, the average duration of lake ice was 42 days shorter. Record high spring temperatures in central Siberia drove rapid snow melt that contributed to the lowest June snow cover extent across Eurasia in the 54-year record. As is typical, some areas around the world were notably dry in 2020 and some were notably wet. The Middle East experienced an extreme drought during autumn, with most places reporting no precipitation in October. In South America, the Bolivian lowlands suffered one of its most severe dro ghts on record during autumn. Drought also spanned the Chaco and Pantanal in Bolivia, Paraguay, and southern Brazil. The Paraguay River shrank to its lowest levels in half a century. A decadal “mega drought” in south-central Chile continued through its 11th year, with extreme conditions in the most populated areas. Argentina reported its driest year since 1995. In North America, drought continued to prevail in the West. The lack of moisture in drought-stricken regions often provide ideal conditions for fire. Total fire emissions in the western United States in 2020 were almost three times higher than the 2003–10 mean. The Arctic experienced its highest fire year in terms of carbon emitted into the atmosphere, surpassing the record set in 2019 by 34%, with most of the fires occurring in Arctic Asia. In the tropics, the Amazon saw its highest fire activity since 2012, while fire activity in tropical Asia—including Indonesia—was one of the lowest on record, related to wet conditions as La Niña evolved during the fire season. The 2020 Southwest Asian Monsoon season (June–September) was the wettest since 1981, also coincident with the emergence of La Niña. The Meiyu rainy season, which usually occurs between July and August over the Yangtze and Huaihe River Valleys of China, was extended by two months in 2020. The May–October total rainfall averaged over the area was the most since the start of the record in 1961. Associated severe flooding affected about 45.5 million people. A widespread desert locust infestation during 2019–20 impacted equatorial and northern East Africa, as heavy rains and prevailing winds were favorable for breeding and movement of swarms across Kenya, Ethiopia, northeastern Somalia, Uganda, South Sudan, and northern Tanzania. The massive infestation destroyed thousands of square kilometers of cropland and pasture lands, resulting in one million people in need of food aid in Ethiopia alone. Extremely heavy rains in April also triggered widespread flooding and landslides in Ethiopia, Somalia, Rwanda, and Burundi. The Lake Victoria region was the wettest in its 40-year record. Across the global oceans, the average ocean heat content reached a record high in 2020 and the sea surface temperature was the third highest on record, surpassed only by 2016 and 2019. Approximately 84% of the ocean surface experienced at least one marine heatwave (MHW) in 2020. For the second time in the past decade, a major MHW developed in the northeast Pacific, covering an area roughly six times the size of Alaska in September. Global mean sea level was record high for the ninth consecutive year, reaching 91.3 mm above the 1993 average when satellite measurements began, an increase of 3.5 mm over 2019. Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet accounted for about 0.8 mm of the sea level rise, with an overall loss of 293 ± 66 gigatons of ice. A total of 102 named tropical storms were observed during the Northern and Southern Hemisphere storm seasons, well above the 1981–2010 average of 85. In the North Atlantic, a record 30 tropical cyclones formed, surpassing the previous record of 28 in 2005. Major Hurricanes Eta and Iota made landfall along the eastern coast of Nicaragua in nearly the same location within a two-week period, impacting over seven million people across Central America. In the western North Pacific, Super Typhoon Goni was the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in the historical record and led to the evacuation of almost 1 million people in the Philippines. Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Gati was the strongest recorded cyclone to make landfall over Somalia. Bosaso, in northeast Somalia, received 128 mm of rainfall in a 24-hour period, exceeding the city’s average annual total of 100 mm. Above Earth’s surface, the annual lower troposphere temperature equaled 2016 as the highest on record, while stratospheric temperatures continued to decline. In 2020, the stratospheric winter polar vortices in both hemispheres were unusually strong and stable. Between December 2019 and March 2020, the Arctic pol r vortex was the strongest since the beginning of the satellite era, contributing to record low stratospheric ozone levels in the region that lasted into spring. The anomalously strong and persistent Antarctic polar vortex was linked to the longest-lived, and 12th-largest, ozone hole over the region, which lasted to the end of December. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Blunden, J.; Boyer, T.",Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/2021bamsstateoftheclimate.1,615

To that end, we propose and analyze a novel metapopulation network model, particularly suitable for modeling commuter traffic patterns, that takes into account the connectivity between a heterogeneous set of communities, each with its own infection dynamics. In the novel metapopulation model that we propose here, transport schemes developed in optimal transport theory provide an efficient and easily implementable way of describing the temporary population redistribution due to traffic, such as the daily commuter traffic between work and residence. Locally, infection dynamics in individual communities are described in terms of a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) compartment model, modified to account for the specific features of COVID-19, most notably its spread by asymptomatic and presymptomatic infected individuals. The mathematical foundation of our metapopulation network model is akin to a transport scheme between two population distributions, namely the residential distribution and the workplace distribution, whose interface can be inferred from commuter mobility data made available by the US Census Bureau. We use the proposed metapopulation model to test the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 on two networks, a smaller one comprising 7 counties in the Greater Cleveland area in Ohio, and a larger one consisting of 74 counties in the Pittsburgh–Cleveland–Detroit corridor following the Lake Erie’s American coastline. The model simulations indicate that densely populated regions effectively act as amplifiers of the infection for the surrounding, less densely populated areas, in agreement with the pattern of infections observed in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Computed examples show that the model can be used also to test different mitigation strategies, including one based on state-level travel restrictions, another on county level triggered social distancing, as well as a combination of the two. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Calvetti, D.; Hoover, A.

Initiatives where students engage in independent research linked to cutting-edge physics within their school over several months might help mitigate this, potentially facilitating the uptake of science in higher education. However, how such initiatives are best supported remains unclear and understudied. This paper evaluates a provision framework, `Physics Research in School Environments' (PRiSE), using survey data from participating 14-18 year-old students and their teachers to understand their experience of the programme. The results show that PRiSE appears to provide much more positive experiences than typical university outreach initiatives due to the nature of the opportunities afforded over several months, which schools would not be able to provide without external input. The intensive support offered is deemed necessary, with all elements appearing equally important.

Accumulating evidence suggests that emotional and cognitive self-regulation is particularly needed to effectively cope with stress. Therefore, we investigated the predictive value of affective and inhibitory prefrontal control for stress burden during the COVID-19 crisis. Method: Physical and mental health burden were assessed using an online survey, which was administered to 104 participants of an ongoing German at-risk birth cohort during the first wave in April 2020. Two follow-ups were carried out during the pandemic, one capturing the relaxation during summer and the other the beginning of the second wave of the crisis. Prefrontal activity during emotion regulation and inhibitory control were assessed prior to the COVID-19 crisis. Results: Increased inferior frontal gyrus activity during emotion regulation predicted lower stress burden at the beginning of the first and the second wave of the crisis. In contrast, inferior and medial frontal gyrus activity during inhibitory control predicted effective coping only during the summer, when infection rates decreased but stress burden remained unchanged. These findings remained significant when controlling for sociodemographic and clinical confounders such as stressful life events prior to the crisis or current psychopathology. Conclusions: We demonstrate that differential stress-buffering effects are predicted by the neural underpinnings of emotion regulation and cognitive regulation at different stages during the pandemic. These findings may inform future prevention strategies to foster stress coping in unforeseen situations.","Monninger, M.; Pollok, T. M.; Aggensteiner, P.

While previous reports have examined the transcriptome of freshly-cultured MSCs from some tissues, little is known about the single-cell transcriptomic profiles of out-of-thaw MSCs from different tissue sources. Such understanding could help determine which tissue origins and delivery methods are best suited for specific indications. Here, we characterized cryopreserved MSCs, immediately post-thaw, from bone marrow (BM) and cord tissue (CT), using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We show that out-of-thaw BM-vs. CT-MSCs have significant differences in gene expression. Gene-set enrichment analyses implied divergent functional potential. In addition, we show that MSC-batches can vary significantly in cell cycle status, suggesting different proliferative vs. immunomodulatory potentials. Our results provide a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape of clinically and industrially relevant MSC products.

174353,Does risk perception affect the way we practice ophthalmology? About the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) is a deeply conserved protein kinase that coordinates eukaryotic metabolism with nutrient availability. In mammals, TOR specifically promotes translation of ribosomal protein mRNAs when amino acids are available to support protein synthesis. The mechanisms controlling translation downstream from TOR remain contested, however, and are largely unexplored in plants. Here, we took parallel global profiling approaches to define the in planta TOR-regulated transcriptome, translatome, proteome, and phosphoproteome. We found that TOR regulates ribosome biogenesis in plants at multiple levels, but through mechanisms that do not directly depend on the canonical 5′ oligopyrimidine tract motif (5′TOP) found in mammalian ribosomal protein mRNAs. To investigate this further, we focused on a putative TOR substrate identified in our phosphoproteome: LARP1, a eukaryotic RNA-binding protein that is proposed to mediate TOR translational control of 5′TOP mRNAs in humans and that has gained increased interest because it associates with SARS-CoV-2. By conducting parallel global profiling experiments with larp1 mutants, we discovered that the TOR-LARP1 signaling axis controls 5′TOP mRNA translation in plants and defined a set of conserved eukaryotic 5′TOP mRNAs that encode cyclins, importins/karyopherins, translation elongation factors, and TCTP1, among others. We then identified novel, plant-specific 5′TOP mRNAs involved in critical biological processes, including ribosome biogenesis, chromatin remodeling, and auxin signaling. Our study illuminates the ancestral roles of the TOR-LARP1-5′TOP metabolic regulatory network and provides evolutionary context for ongoing debates about the molecular function of LARP1 in eukaryotic cells.","Scarpin, M.

It is important for management to keep track of this figure to proactively avoid overcrowding and maintain a high level of quality of care. The objective of this work consists in proposing a decision-aid tool for hospital managers allowing to decide on the bed requirements for a given hospital or network of hospitals on a short-medium term horizon. To that extent we propose a new data-driven discrete-event simulation model based on data from a French university hospital to predict bed and staff requirements. We propose a case study to illustrate the tool's ability to monitor bed occupancy in the recovery unit given the admission rate of ED patients during the pandemic of Sars-Cov-2. These results give an interesting insight on the situation, providing decision makers with a powerful tool to establish an enlightened response to this situation.","Le Lay, J.; Augusto, V.; Xie, X.

The purpose of this review paper is to develop a comparative study of demographic and obstetric properties of primiparous females at young and advanced maternal age. Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out of the participants based upon the inclusion strategy. Two groups with 150 participants in each was made;one group had participants aged above 35 years and other group had participants with age between 20 to 29 years. Variables including weight, BMI, age, pre-pregnancy condition, health state, financial status and other factors were also included. Results: It was found that females with advanced age were more financially stable, literate, and professionals who pursued their carriers even after bearing a child. These advanced age women also reflected more developed background knowledge about pregnancy, child care, labor and parental attitude. However, medically speaking, these females faced more infertility issues, miscarriages and Caesarean sections in comparison to young primiparous females. Conclusion: Pregnant ladies of advanced maternal age were different from young ladies in knowledge, demographic, financial, and parental attitudes and characteristics.","Alen, A.",Systematic Reviews in Pharmacy,https://doi.org/10.31838/srp.2021.4.34,615
176032,"The ocular pathway, a risk for developing COVID-19",2021,"The global crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a proper risk assessment of respiratory pathogens in indoor settings. This paper documents the COVID Airborne Risk Assessment (CARA) methodology, to assess the potential exposure of airborne SARS-CoV-2 viruses, with an emphasis on the effect of certain virological and immunological factors in the quantification of the risk. The proposed model is the result of a multidisciplinary approach linking physical, mechanical and biological domains, benchmarked with clinical and experimental data, enabling decision makers or facility managers to perform risk assessments against airborne transmission. The model was tested against two benchmark outbreaks, showing good agreement. The tool was also applied to several everyday-life settings, in particular for the cases of a shared office, classroom and ski cabin. We found that 20% of infected hosts can emit approximately 2 orders of magnitude more viral-containing particles, suggesting the importance of super-emitters in airborne transmission. The use of surgical-type masks provides a 5-fold reduction in viral emissions. Natural ventilation through the opening of windows at all times are effective strategies to decrease the concentration of virions and slightly opening a window in the winter has approximately the same effect as a full window opening during the summer. Although vaccination is an effective protection measure, non-pharmaceutical interventions, which significantly reduce the viral density in the air (ventilation, masks), should be actively supported and included early in the risk assessment process. We propose a critical threshold value approach which could be used to define an acceptable risk level in a given indoor setting.","Henriques, A.; Mounet, N.; Aleixo, L.; Elson, P.; Devine, J.; Azzopardi, G.; Andreini, M.; Rognlien, M.; Tarocco, N.; Tang, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.14.21264988v1?rss=1,615

The rise in depressive disorders is one of the negative effects associated directly and indirectly to the pandemic.ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of depressive disorders among the patients admitted to our hospital. The state of pandemia was declared on the 11th of March but it had already become a main stream media subject in our country at the beginning of the month with real life changes for our citizens.MethodsA retrospective study was performed at the Psychiatric Hospital ‘Elisabeta Doamna’ Galati, using the exact same period, between 01.03 and 30.09, in 2019 and 2020. ICD-10 criteria were used and pacients with either F32.x,F33.x or F38.x as discharge diagnosis were included.ResultsIn total, 7638 cases were admitted during the period in 2019, of which 751 (9,83%) had depressive disorders. In comparison with 2020 where out of 4050 admitted patients, the number had risen to 1034 (25,53%) a net increase in total number of cases by 37.6%.ConclusionsAnalysis of the data shows a 2.5 times increase in the percentage of depressive disorders among our patients.

Most efforts worldwide by the scientific community and commercial companies focused on the formulation of protocols for SARS CoV-2 analysis in wastewater and approaches addressing the quantitative relationship between WBE and medical surveillance are lacking. In the present study, a mathematical model is developed which uses as input the number of daily positive medical tests together with the highly non-linear shedding rate curve of individuals to estimate the evolution of virus shedding rate in wastewater along calendar days. A comprehensive parametric study by the model using medical surveillance data for the city of Thessaloniki (~700,000 inhabitants, North Greece) reveals the conditions under which WBE can be used as an early warning tool for predicting pandemic outbreaks. It is shown that early warning capacity is not the same along the days of an outbreak and varies strongly with the number of days apart between the day of maximum shedding rate of individuals in their disease cycle and the day of their medical testing. Moreover, the present data show that there exists a proportion between unreported cases (asymptomatic persons and patients with mild symptoms that do not seek medical advice) and reported cases. The proportion is not steady but increases with the number of reported cases. The early detection capacity of WBE improves substantially in the presence of an increasing number of unreported cases. For Thessaloniki at the peak of the pandemic in mid-November 2020, the number of unreported cases reached a maximum around 4 times the number of reported people.","Petala, M.; Kostglou, M.; Karapantsios, T.; Dovas, C.; Lytras, T.; Paraskevis, D.; Roilides, E.; Koutsolioutsou-Benaki, A.; Panagiotakopoulos, G.; Sypsa, V.; Metallidis, S.; Papa, A.; Stylianidis, E.; Papadopoulos, A.; Tsiodras, S.; Papaioannou, N.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.04.21259903v1?rss=1,615

To learn more about this special type of knowledge worker from their first-person perspective, we conducted three studies to learn how developers describe a day in their life through vlogs on YouTube and how these vlogs were received by the broader community. We first interviewed 16 developers who vlogged to identify their motivations for creating this content and their intention behind what they chose to portray. Second, we analyzed 130 vlogs (video blogs) to understand the range of the content conveyed through videos. Third, we analyzed 1176 comments from the 130 vlogs to understand the impact the vlogs have on the audience. We found that developers were motivated to promote and build a diverse community, by sharing different aspects of life that define their identity, and by creating awareness about learning and career opportunities in computing. They used vlogs to share a variety of how software developers work and live -- showcasing often unseen experiences, including intimate moments from their personal life. From our comment analysis, we found that the vlogs were valuable to the audience to find information and seek advice. Commenters sought opportunities to connect with others over shared triumphs and trials they faced that were also shown in the vlogs. As a central theme, we found that developers use vlogs to challenge the misconceptions and stereotypes around their identity, work-life, and well-being. These social stigmas are obstacles to an inclusive and accepting community and can deter people from choosing software development as a career. We also discuss the implications of using vlogs to support developers, researchers, and beyond.","Chattopadhyay, Souti; Ford, Denae; Zimmermann, Thomas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06302v1.pdf,615

Food is the lens through which we examine the Janus-faced character of care during the Covid-19 pandemic. Based on qualitative empirical findings, we argue that time is crucial to whether people experience ambivalence, joy or constraints in providing food for the self, the family and the wider community. In Berlin, Germany, the pandemic lockdown and closing of schools and childcare facilities led to an increase of time and energy spent on care work in the household. This care work has remained feminized. Women are at the forefront of organizing daily routines and inventing new strategies to manage time such as increased online shopping, intensified planning of errands, cooking and enjoying meals together, or becoming involved in local food networks. The altered temporal rhythms during the pandemic offer potential for the revaluation of care and for organizing care as a shared responsibility, however it remains questionable how this reorganization will evolve in the long run. For the future, the economic study of food must finally include caring practices in its valuation since they are the backbone of individual and societal well-being and demand considerable time, especially from women.","Bruckner, M.; Cajic, S.; Bauhardt, C.",Food and Foodways,https://doi.org/10.1080/07409710.2021.1943612,615

However, evidence for negative mental and physiological health consequences of such measures for students is increasing, highlighting the need for evidence-based recommendations on how to safely reopen schools. This study presents experiences when implementing opt-in, at-home SARS-CoV-2 screening using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to facilitate safe face-to-face-teaching during a pandemic. Methods: We present data form a prospective study implementing an RDT-based screening program at a primary school in southwest Germany. We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with participating children, parents, and school stakeholders to elicit implementation experiences and screening perception. Results: The screening intervention was highly accepted and appreciated among participants; no positive RDT was reported over the duration of the study. Self-testing at home before coming to school was feasible, but more positive consequences of screening participation (e.g., easing of mask mandates) besides a personal feeling of safety would be appreciated. Participants preferred home-based RDTs over some other measures, particularly mask mandates. Despite the RDTs being licensed as self-tests in Germany, additional training can help avoid mistakes, and ensuring intervention ownership and improving pre-implementation communication can facilitate buy-in. Conclusions: Ag-RDT-based SARS-CoV-2 screening programs relying on self-testing at home proved feasible and accepted among primary school students, parents, and school staff who participated in this study.","Wachinger, J.; Schirmer, M.; Taeuber, N.; McMahon, S.

For each observation, contribution from Biomass Burning (BB, in percent) to the BC has also been recorded. These measurements have been analyzed to segregate different sources, responsible for BC at this rural station. The results reveal that the major contributor is ‘traffic’ (fossil-fuel diesel emissions), followed by ‘biomass smoke’, wood-burning activities. The diurnal variation in BC and associated BB over this study area reveals a significant maximum around 0900 h and minimum around 1600 h. These maximum and minimum concentrations are attributed to transport activities during morning and ascending of local atmospheric boundary-layer height.

The evidence of this potential has been proved during the recent covid-19 pandemic, which was characterised by the use of medical wearable devices to help with the medical data exchange between the healthcare providers and patients in a bid to contain the pandemic. However, the use of these technologies has also raised questions and concerns about security and privacy risks. To assist in resolving this issue, this paper proposes a blockchain-based access control framework for managing access to users' medical data. This is facilitated by using a smart contract on the blockchain, which allows for delegated access control and secure user authentication. This solution leverages blockchain technology's inherent autonomy and immutability to solve the existing access control challenges. We have presented the solution in the form of a medical wearable sensor prototype and a mobile app that uses the Ethereum blockchain in a real data sharing control scenario. Based on the empirical results, the proposed solution has proven effective. It has the potential to facilitate reliable data exchange while also protecting sensitive health information against potential threats.

Among such extraordinary measures is the closure of international borders leading to the cancellation of air travel by commercial airlines. The carbon emissions from air travel affect global warming. To this end, some authors ranked aircraft as if it were a country and compared the volume of carbon emissions generated by air travel to that generated by countries from other sources. Commercial air travel ranked seventh after Germany in terms of carbon emissions. This policy review, therefore, explored the impact of COVID-19 lockdown and travel restrictions on global warming. As a result of lockdown, there is a likelihood of a significant decrease in carbon emissions and global warming. Assuming the estimated global emissions remain constant annually, an estimated 9 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions would be avoided by the end of 2020 provided that the lockdown continues. To accurately measure the value of reduced carbon dioxide emissions during the global lockdown, it is recommended that scientific studies be conducted to estimate the carbon emissions generated by the few aircraft granted waivers to transport essential commodities during the global lockdown and deduct it from the 9 gigatonnes. After the global lockdown, through a travel policy review, governments and organizations are encouraged to restrict physical meetings or activities that involve air travel only to situations where a physical presence is unavoidable.","Jegede, O.

In this paper, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm was applied to construct a model of classification for predicting patients' status using actual dataset gathered from the many Iraqi hospitals through a questionnaire prepared and distributed for 290 patients. A large number of features are included in the medical data sets. When the data sets contain noisy features, the performance of the classifier is reduced. To solve this problem, select the subset feature. The selection of features enhances accuracy. Thus to get a highly accurate model and identifying the most effective features that affect the status, two experiments were executed, first experiment implemented without using K-NN and second experiment implemented based on CorrelationAttributeEval, GainRatio AttributeEval, and ReliefF AttributeEval algorithms that are running in WEKA tool for enabling decision makers in hospitals to predict and enhance the status of their patients. Finally to observe the effectiveness of using feature selections, using k-fold cross-validation we assess a proposed model in the two experiments.

Considerable variation among SARS patients with respect to circulating viral load and patterns of SARS-CoV-evoked cytokine responses was recorded. No single cytokine profile was observed in all patients, yet serum concentrations of interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-10, CXCL10, CCL5 and CXCL8 were found to be elevated above normal levels during the course of the disease in all patients. Expression levels for IL-10, IFN-gamma and CXCL10 consistently peaked within 4 days of peak viral load. IL-12p70, IL-4 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha concentrations were consistently highest within 5 days of peak viral load.

Sixty-two Northern aplomado and six peregrine falcons died. Epidemiologic analyses indicated a point source epizootic, horizontal transmission, and increased relative risk associated with cross-species brooding of eggs. Primary lesions in affected birds were inclusion body hepatitis, splenomegaly, and enteritis. The etiology in all mortalities was determined by molecular analyses to be a new species of adenovirus distantly related to the group I avian viruses, serotypes 1 and 4, Aviadenovirus. In situ hybridization and PCR demonstrated that the virus was epitheliotropic and lymphotropic and that infection was systemic in the majority of animals. Adeno-associated virus was also detected by PCR in most affected falcons, but no other infectious agents or predisposing factors were found in any birds. Subsequent to the 1996 epizootic, a similar disease caused by the same adenovirus was found over a 5-year period in orange-breasted falcons (Falco deiroleucus), teita falcons (Falco fasciinucha), a merlin (Falco columbarius), a Vanuatu peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus nesiotes), and gyrfalcon x peregrine falcon hybrids (Falco rusticolus/peregrinus) that died in Wyoming, Oklahoma, Minnesota, and California.

An exploratory study.,2005,"Context Some research has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has had effects on the various functions of the renal system. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a dangerous and broadly spread pathological illness. Objective In this review, we emphasize that AKI can be a severe complication of COVID-19 and highlight the importance of assessing, defining, and reporting the course of AKI. Design The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. We searched four databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI (Chinese Database), to identify studies reporting COVID-19. Articles published on or before May 10, 2020 were eligible for inclusion. We used the following search terms: ""Coronavirus"" or ""2019-nCoV"" or ""COVID-19"" or ""AKI"" or ""renal failure"" or ""nephrology"". Setting This study was take place at Jouf University, Sakaka, Al-Jouf, Saudi Arabia. Results The review showed that AKI patients, who were susceptible to a cytokine storm, showed clinical deterioration. This result allowed the current research team to develop a hypothesis of a set of adverse events in COVID-19 that proposes the modification of inflammatory pathways by stimulation of nAChRα7. The stimulation could occur by way of IL-6 / JAK2 / STAT3 / SOCS3 and NF-κB (p65)/IL-18, which work together to induce AKI and increase overall renal-related diagnostic markers, such as plasma creatinine and tubular cell damage. In addition, the functioning of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway may be determined by nicotine. Pharmacological nicotine products are widely available, and their role in COVID-19-mediated AKI can be further evaluated. Conclusions The research team concluded that the dysregulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system could explain most of the clinical features of severe COVID-19.","Saad Alharbi, Khalid; Al-Abbasi, Fahad A; Prasad Agrawal, Gopal; Sharma, Ajay; Kowti, Rajesh; Kazmi, Imran",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32710733/,615

We applied a recently proposed methodology to identify and classify INTs in the ESCAPE randomized controlled trial (Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times). METHODS The core laboratory identified INTs on 24-hour follow-up imaging, blinded to treatment allocation, after assessing all baseline imaging. INTs were classified into 3 types (I-III) and 2 subtypes (A/B) based on size and if catheter manipulation was likely performed across the vessel territory ostium. Logistic regression was used to understand the effect of multiple a priori identified variables on INT occurrence. Ordinal logistic regression was used to analyze the effect of INTs on modified Rankin Scale shift at 90 days. RESULTS From 308 patients included, 14 INTs (4.5% overall; 2.8% on follow-up noncontrast computed tomography, 11.7% on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging) were identified (5.0% in endovascular treatment arm versus 4.0% in control arm [P=0.7]). The use of intravenous alteplase was associated with a 68% reduction in the odds of INT occurrence (3.0% with versus 9.1% without; odds ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.96; adjusted for age, sex, and treatment type). No other variables were associated with INTs. INT occurrence was associated with reduced probability of good clinical outcome (common odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.74; adjusted for age, type of treatment, and follow-up scan). CONCLUSIONS INTs are uncommon, detected more frequently on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging, and affect clinical outcome. In experienced centers, endovascular treatment is likely not causal, whereas intravenous alteplase may be therapeutic. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

199810,Women experts underrepresented in pandemic coverage,2021,"Rabies is a serious zoonotic disease. Recovery has been well documented in only six human patients worldwide. Five of those patients had received rabies vaccinations before illness; one had not received rabies vaccination but survived infection after prolonged intensive care. In most of these survivors, moderate to profound neurologic sequelae occurred. In all six survivors, rabies was diagnosed based on exposure history, compatible clinical symptoms, and detection of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies (VNA). This report describes the clinical course and laboratory findings of an adolescent girl with encephalitis who had not had rabies vaccination and who had been exposed to bats 2 months before illness. Antibodies to rabies virus were detected in specimens of the girl's serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA). However, the presence of rabies VNA was not detected until after she had received single doses of rabies vaccine and human rabies immune globulin (HRIG). Although the patient required multiple hospitalizations and follow-up visits for recurrent neurologic symptoms, she survived without intensive care. No alternate etiology was determined, and abortive human rabies (defined in this report as recovery from rabies without intensive care) was diagnosed. Public education should emphasize avoiding exposure to bats and other potentially rabid wildlife and seeking prompt medical attention after exposure to such animals. Rabies is preventable if rabies immune globulin and vaccine are administered soon after an exposure; however, this case also suggests the rare possibility that abortive rabies can occur in humans and might go unrecognized.",,MMWR.

A care gap, created by public sector austerity, has resulted in insufficient staff to meet residents' health and social care needs. Families pay to fill this care gap in public funding with companion care, which limits demands on the state to collectively bear the costs of care for older adults. We assess companions' work in light of Vosko's (2015) and Rodgers and Rodgers' (1989) dimensions for precariousness. We discuss how to classify paid care work that overlaps with paid formal and unpaid informal care. Our findings illuminate how companions' labour is simultaneously autonomous and precarious; it fills a care gap and creates one, and can be relational compared with staffs' task-oriented work.","Daly, Tamara; Armstrong, Pat",The Journal of industrial relations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27840453/,615

Each outbreak was caused by a multiply-resistant and lactose-fermenting strain of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium. The use of Levine eosin-methylene blue agar in combination with screening of suspect colonies for C8 esterase enzyme and inoculation of colonies into sulfide-indole-motility medium for hydrogen sulfide production was particularly effective for their detection. A hypothesis for the creation of lactose-fermenting salmonellae in the environment is presented.

201679,COVID-19 myopericarditis: A case report,2021,"INTRODUCTION With the unprecedented challenges imposed on the modern healthcare system due to the COVID-19 pandemic, innovative solutions needed to be swiftly implemented to maintain clinical oversight on patient care. Telemedicine was introduced in Singapore in community-based haemodialysis (HD) centres to comply with the Ministry of Health's directives on movement restriction of healthcare workers and related measures to minimise the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare facilities. METHODS We describe here our experience of 26 community haemodialysis centres in Singapore, analysing clinical audit data, as well as comparing hospitalisation and mortality rates as outcomes in the time frames of pre- and post-introduction of telemedicine. RESULTS We found that the hospitalisation rate was 13.9% (95% CI: 5.6%-21.5%, P<0.001) lower in the period after telemedicine rounds were introduced. The mortality rates per 100 person-years (95% CI) were 11.04 versus 7.99 in the compared groups, respectively, with no significant increase in mortality during the months when telemedicine was performed. CONCLUSION Patients received appropriate care in a timely manner, with telemedicine implementation, and such measures did not lead to suboptimal healthcare outcomes. Telemedicine was a successful tool for physician oversight under movement control measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic and may continue to prove useful in the 'new normal' era of healthcare delivery for HD patients in community-based dialysis centres, operated by the National Kidney Foundation in Singapore.","Singh, Tripti; Ngoh, Clara Ly; Wong, Kin; Khan, Behram Ali","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33283839/,615

204701,"Lessons Learned?: Medical Education, Vulnerabilities and Social Accountability During the Pandemic/ O Que Já Aprendemos?: Educação Médica, Vulnerabilidades e Responsabilidade Social em Tempo de Pandemia",2020,"BACKGROUND: The mechanism for spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been attributed to large particles produced by coughing and sneezing. There is controversy whether smaller airborne particles may transport SARS-CoV-2. Smaller particles, particularly fine particulate matter (&#8804; 2.5 µm in diameter), can remain airborne for longer periods than larger particles and after inhalation will penetrate deeply into the lungs. Little is known about the size distribution and location of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA. METHODS: As a measure of hospital-related exposure, air samples of three particle sizes (> 10.0 µm, 10.0-2.5 µm, and &#8804; 2.5 µm) were collected in a Boston, Massachusetts (USA) hospital from April to May 2020 (N = 90 size-fractionated samples). Locations included outside negative-pressure COVID-19 wards, a hospital ward not directly involved in COVID-19 patient care, and the emergency department. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in 9% of samples and in all size fractions at concentrations of 5 to 51 copies m-3. Locations outside COVID-19 wards had the fewest positive samples. A non-COVID-19 ward had the highest number of positive samples, likely reflecting staff congregation. The probability of a positive sample was positively associated (r = 0.95, p < 0.01) with the number of COVID-19 patients in the hospital. The number of COVID-19 patients in the hospital was positively associated (r = 0.99, p < 0.01) with the number of new daily cases in Massachusetts. CONCLUSIONS: More frequent detection of positive samples in non-COVID-19 than COVID-19 hospital areas indicates effectiveness of COVID-ward hospital controls in controlling air concentrations and suggests the potential for disease spread in areas without the strictest precautions. The positive associations regarding the probability of a positive sample, COVID-19 cases in the hospital, and cases in Massachusetts suggests that hospital air sample positivity was related to community burden. SARS-CoV-2 RNA with fine particulate matter supports the possibility of airborne transmission over distances greater than six feet. The findings support guidelines that limit exposure to airborne particles including fine particles capable of longer distance transport and greater lung penetration.","Stern, Rebecca A; Koutrakis, Petros; Martins, Marco A G; Lemos, Bernardo; Dowd, Scot E; Sunderland, Elsie M; Garshick, Eric",Respir Res,,615

206281,Ghana’s informal economic sector in the face of a pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Health care-associated infections during previous coronavirus epidemics involving severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome resulted from human-to-human transmission in hemodialysis (HD) facilities. The effect of a strategy of HD with cohort isolation-separate dialysis sessions for close contacts of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-on the prevention of secondary transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in HD units is unknown. METHODS: Our multicenter cohort study of an HD with cohort isolation strategy enrolled close contacts of patients with confirmed COVID-19, including patients on HD and health care workers in HD units. Close contacts had been identified by epidemiologic investigation and tested negative on an immediate screening test for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: As of March 14, 11 patients on HD and 7 health care workers from 11 HD centers were diagnosed as having COVID-19. The immediate screening test was performed in 306 people, and among them, 302 close contacts with negative test results were enrolled. HD with cohort isolation was performed among all close contacts for a median of 14 days in seven centers. During cohort isolation, nine patients showed symptoms but tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Two health care workers in the HD units (0.66% of the total group) were diagnosed at the termination test for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The transmission of COVID-19 can be controlled without closure of HD centers by implementing preemptive activities, including early detection with rapid testing, cohort isolation, collaboration between institutions, and continuous monitoring of infection. Our strategy and experience may provide helpful guidance for circumstances involving the rapid spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","Cho, Jang-Hee; Kang, Seok Hui; Park, Hayne Cho; Kim, Dong Ki; Lee, Sang-Ho; Do, Jun Young; Park, Jong Won; Kim, Seong Nam; Kim, Myeong Seong; Jin, Kyubok; Kang, Gun Woo; Park, Sun-Hee; Kim, Yong-Lim; Lee, Young-Ki",J Am Soc Nephrol,,615

210407,Metabolic dysfunction and immunometabolism in COVID-19 pathophysiology and therapeutics,2021,"The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to hyperspectral mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data has received considerable attention over recent years. Various methodologies have shown great promise in their ability to handle the complexity and size of MSI data sets. Advances in this area have been particularly appealing for MSI of biological samples, which typically produce highly complicated data with often subtle relationships between features. There are many different machine learning approaches that have been applied to MSI data over the past two decades. In this review, we focus on a subset of non-linear machine learning techniques that have mostly only been applied in the past 5 years. Specifically, we review the use of the self-organizing map (SOM), SOM with relational perspective mapping (SOM-RPM), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). While not their only functionality, we have grouped these techniques based on their ability to produce what we refer to as similarity maps. Similarity maps are color representations of hyperspectral data, in which spectral similarity between pixels-that is, their distance in high-dimensional space-is represented by relative color similarity. In discussing these techniques, we describe, briefly, their associated algorithms and functionalities, and also outline applications in MSI research with a strong focus on biological sample types. The aim of this review is therefore to introduce this relatively recent paradigm for visualizing and exploring hyperspectral MSI, while also providing a comparison between each technique discussed.","Gardner, Wil; Cutts, Suzanne M; Phillips, Don R; Pigram, Paul J",Biopolymers,,615

A few reports from the literature suggest that Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVSTs) may be a direct complication of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical and radiological presentation of COVID-19 positive patients diagnosed with CVST. METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional, retrospective study of patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID-19 reviewed from March 1, 2020 to November 8, 2020. We evaluated their clinical presentations, risk factors, clinical management, and outcome. We reviewed all published cases of CVST in patients with COVID-19 infection from January 1, 2020 to November 13, 2020. RESULTS: There were 8 patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID-19 during the study period at 7 out of 31 participating centers. Patients in our case series were mostly female (7/8, 87.5%). Most patients presented with non-specific symptoms such as headache (50%), fever (50%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (75%). Several patients presented with focal neurologic deficits (2/8, 25%) or decreased consciousness (2/8, 25%). D-dimer and inflammatory biomarkers were significantly elevated relative to reference ranges in patients with available laboratory data. The superior sagittal and transverse sinuses were the most common sites for acute CVST formation (6/8, 75%). Median time to onset of focal neurologic deficit from initial COVID-19 diagnosis was 3 days (interquartile range 0.75-3 days). Median time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to CVST radiologic diagnosis was 11 days (interquartile range 6-16.75 days). Mortality was low in this cohort (1/8 or 12.5%).

DesignA cross-sectional study. SettingCOVID-19 daily case and death data from the initial case through 29 November 2020. Participants46 countries comprising the WHO African region. Main outcome measuresWe used five pandemic response indicators for each country: speed at which the pandemic reached the country, speed at which the first 50 cases accumulated, maximum monthly attack rate, cumulative attack rate, and crude case fatality ratio (CFR). We studied the effect of 13 predictor variables on the country-level variation in them using a principal component analysis, followed by regression. ResultsCountries with higher tourism activities, GDP per capita, and proportion of older people had higher monthly (p < 0.001) and cumulative attack rates (p < 0.001) and lower CFRs (p = 0.052). Countries having more stringent early COVID-19 response policies experienced greater delay in arrival of the first case (p < 0.001). The speed at which the first 50 cases occurred was slower in countries whose neighbors had higher cumulative attack rates (p = 0.06). ConclusionsWhile global connectivity and tourism could facilitate the spread of airborne infectious agents, the observed differences in attack rates between African countries might also be due to differences in testing capacities or age distribution. Wealthy countries managed to minimize adverse outcomes. Further, careful and early implementation of strict government policies, such as restricting tourism, could be pivotal to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidently, good quality data and sufficient testing capacities are essential to unravel the epidemiology of an outbreak. We thus urge decision-makers to reduce these barriers to ensure rapid responses to future threats to public health and economic stability.

Community pharmacies are essential services authorized to continue their activity during the emergency. To date, a clear image is lacking of the critical issues Italian community pharmacists had to face and of how they responded in their daily work.. Objective To describe procedures and critical logistical-organizational issues encountered by Italian community pharmacists and to collect the main requests reported by patients to pharmacists. Setting A national survey on Italian community pharmacists. Method A cross-sectional survey using a reasoned questionnaire was sent during the pandemic peak to Italian pharmacies, divided in two groups according to the incidence of COVID-19: ""Red Zones"" and ""non-Red Zones"". Main outcome measure Exploring the most frequently adopted measures by the pharmacists. Results 169 community Pharmacists answered the questionnaire. The most frequently adopted measures were the use of gloves, surgical masks and protective barriers at the drug counter. Most implemented services for customers were: booking of prescriptions, delivery of medications and implementation of phone consultations. Overall, the questionnaire highlighted an increase in the number of health-related consultations and requests by customers. In Red Zones, there was a higher use of FFP2 and FFP3 masks by pharmacists, where customers were mainly interested in gaining information about specific classes of medications. Conclusion Community pharmacists adapted to lockdown measures by implementing a number of measures. There was an overall increase in pharmacists' personal protective equipment in Red Zones possibly linked to increased risk perception.","Giua, Corrado; Paoletti, Giovanni; Minerba, Luigi; Malipiero, Giacomo; Melone, Giulio; Heffler, Enrico; Pistone, Assunta; Keber, Enrico",Int. j. clin. pharm,,615

We describe here a sensitive and quantitative flow cytometry method using the cytometer-friendly non-adherent Jurkat T-cell line that stably expresses the full-length native spike ""S"" protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a truncated form of the human EGFR that serves a normalizing role. S protein and huEGFRt coding sequences are separated by a T2A self-cleaving sequence, allowing to accurately quantify the presence of anti-S immunoglobulins by calculating a score based on the ratio of fluorescence intensities obtained by double-staining with the test sera and anti-EGFR. The method allows to detect immune individuals regardless of the result of other serological tests or even repeated PCR monitoring. As examples of its use, we show that as much as 28% of the personnel working at the CBMSO in Madrid is already immune. Additionally, we show that anti-S antibodies with protective neutralizing activity are long-lasting and can be detected in sera 8 months after infection.","Horndler, Lydia; Delgado, Pilar; Abia, David; Balabanov, Ivaylo; Martínez-Fleta, Pedro; Cornish, Georgina; Llamas, Miguel A; Serrano-Villar, Sergio; Sánchez-Madrid, Francisco; Fresno, Manuel; van Santen, Hisse M; Alarcón, Balbino",EMBO Mol Med,,615

Therefore, we investigated the relationship between obesity prevalence of the total adult population and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates, in different countries. METHODS: A total of 54 countries from six continents were selected. Country-specific obesity prevalence data were retrieved from the latest non-communicable diseases profiles released by the Non-communicable Diseases and Mental Health Cluster of World Health Organization, while the real time statistics from the Worldometer website were used to extract data on COVID-19 infections and mortality per million of the total population as of September 30, 2020. RESULTS: Obesity prevalence data ranged from 2.0% (Vietnam) to 35.0% (Saudi Arabia). Among the selected countries, the highest number of COVID-19 cases per million was documented in Qatar (n = 44,789) while the lowest was reported from Vietnam (n = 11). Highest mortality per million population due to COVID-19 infections occurred in Peru (n = 981), in contrast with the smallest number reported in Mongolia (n = 0). A significant positive correlation (r = 0.46; p < 0.001) was observed between the total number of COVID-19 infections and the prevalence of obesity. COVID-19 mortality was also significantly correlated (r = 0.34; p < 0.05) with the prevalence of obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity prevalence in each country was significantly associated with both infection and mortality rate of COVID-19.","Jayawardena, Ranil; Jeyakumar, Dhanushya T; Misra, Anoop; Hills, Andrew P; Ranasinghe, Priyanga",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,615

219415,"Government responses to the coronavirus in the United States: immediate remedial actions, rising debt levels and budgetary hangovers",2020,"Musical life became disrupted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many musicians and venues turned to online alternatives, such as livestreaming. In this study, three livestreamed concerts were organized to examine separate, yet interconnected concepts-agency, presence, and social context-to ascertain which components of livestreamed concerts facilitate social connectedness. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling was conducted on 83 complete responses to examine the effects of the manipulations on feelings of social connectedness with the artist and the audience. Results showed that in concert 1, where half of the participants were allowed to vote for the final song to be played, this option did not result in the experience of more agency. Instead, if their preferred song was played (regardless of voting ability) participants experienced greater connectedness to the artist. In concert 2, participants who attended the concert with virtual reality headsets experienced greater feelings of physical presence, as well as greater feelings of connectedness with the artist, than those that viewed a normal YouTube livestream. In concert 3, attendance through Zoom led to greater experience of social presence, but predicted less connectedness with the artist, compared to a normal YouTube livestream. Crucially, a greater negative impact of COVID-19 (e.g., loneliness) predicted feelings of connectedness with the artist, possibly because participants fulfilled their social needs with this parasocial interaction. Examining data from all concerts suggested that physical presence was a predictor of connectedness with both the artist and the audience, while social presence only predicted connectedness with the audience. Correlational analyses revealed that reductions in loneliness and isolation were associated with feelings of shared agency, physical and social presence, and connectedness to the audience. Overall, the findings suggest that in order to reduce feelings of loneliness and increase connectedness, concert organizers and musicians could tune elements of their livestreams to facilitate feelings of physical and social presence.","Onderdijk, K.

221023,[Anti-inflammatory therapies for SARS-COV2 infection from a hematological perspective],2020,"In recent years, increasing research has evaluated the use of natural products as antimicrobial food additives. In this study, antibacterial activity was evaluated for six dihydrochalcone compounds from Malus. Phloretin and 3-hydroxyphloretin exhibited antibacterial effects on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and the antibacterial capacity of these compounds was greater than that of their glycosylated derivatives. Within a certain range, dihydrochalcone hydrophobicity was positively correlated with antibacterial activity. Additionally, glycosylation at the 2'-position of the A-ring and hydroxyl group at the 3-position of the B-ring played a key role in the antibacterial activity of dihydrochalcones. Phloretin and 3-hydroxyphloretin caused damage to bacterial cells by significantly increasing protein and inorganic phosphate leakage. Compared to phloretin, 3-hydroxyphloretin exhibited a smaller effect on Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus and a greater effect on Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae, suggesting different antibacterial mechanisms. At a low dihydrochalcone concentration, the respiration of M. luteus did not change, while membrane permeability increased significantly. These results indicate that the antibacterial mechanism of M. luteus was primarily damage to the cell membrane. However, damage to respiration and the cell membrane might occur simultaneously in K. pneumoniae, suggesting that the antibacterial mechanism of dihydrochalcones also depends on strain type. This study demonstrated the broad-spectrum antibacterial properties of dihydrochalcone compounds commonly found in the genus Malus to foodborne pathogens and elucidated the antibacterial mechanisms. It provides theoretical guidance for future research and application of dihydrochalcones in the food industry.","Wang, Jinxiao; Yang, Ruijia; Xiao, Zhengcao; Xu, Qipeng; Li, Pengmin; Ma, Fengwang",Food funct,,615

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 116 patients that for suspected COVID-19 infection were subjected to the reverse transcription real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. A computer-aided tool was used to calculate on chest CT images healthy residual lung parenchyma, emphysema, GGO and consolidation volumes for both right and left lung. Expert radiologists, in consensus, assessed the CT images using a structured report and attributed a radiological severity score at the disease pulmonary involvement using a scale of five levels. Nonparametric test was performed to assess differences statistically significant among groups. RESULTS: GGO was the most represented feature in suspected CT by COVID-19 infection; it is present in 102/109 (93.6%) patients with a volume percentage value of 19.50% and a median value of 0.64 L, while the emphysema and consolidation volumes were low (0.01 L and 0.03 L, respectively). Among quantified volume, only GGO volume had a difference statistically significant between the group of patients with suspected versus non-suspected CT for COVID-19 (p < < 0.01). There were differences statistically significant among the groups based on radiological severity score in terms of healthy residual parenchyma volume, of GGO volume and of consolidations volume (p < < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that, using a computer-aided tool, the COVID-19 pneumonia was mirrored with a percentage median value of GGO of 19.50% and that only GGO volume had a difference significant between the patients with suspected or non-suspected CT for COVID-19 infection.","Grassi, Roberto; Belfiore, Maria Paola; Montanelli, Alessandro; Patelli, Gianluigi; Urraro, Fabrizio; Giacobbe, Giuliana; Fusco, Roberta; Granata, Vincenza; Petrillo, Antonella; Sacco, Palmino; Mazzei, Maria Antonietta; Feragalli, Beatrice; Reginelli, Alfonso; Cappabianca, Salvatore",,,615

Briefly, RT-PCR was performed with the viral RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs as template to amplify conserved regions in the viral genome. Next, PfAgo, guide DNAs and molecular beacons in appropriate buffer were added to the PCR products, followed by incubating at 95 °C for 20-30 min. Subsequently, the fluorescence signal was detected. This method was named as SARS-CoV-2 PAND. The whole procedure is accomplished in approximately an hour with the using time of the Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR instrument shortened from >1 h to only 3-5 min per batch in comparison with RT-qPCR, hence the shortage of the expensive Real-time PCR instrument is alleviated. Moreover, this platform was also applied to identify SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutant due to its single-nucleotide specificity. The diagnostic results of clinic samples with SARS-CoV-2 PAND displayed 100% consistence with RT-qPCR test.","Wang, Fei; Yang, Jun; He, Ruyi; Yu, Xiao; Chen, Shuliang; Liu, Yang; Wang, Longyu; Li, Aitao; Liu, Linlin; Zhai, Chao; Ma, Lixin",Biosens Bioelectron,,615
230441,"""Not one less""! Adaptation to the Home Office in Times of COVID-19",2021,"IMPORTANCE: False negative SARS-CoV-2 tests can lead to spread of infection in the inpatient setting to other patients and healthcare workers. However, the population of patients with COVID who are admitted with false negative testing is unstudied. OBJECTIVE: To characterize and develop a model to predict true SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients who initially test negative for COVID by PCR. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Five hospitals within the Yale New Haven Health System between 3/10/2020 and 9/1/2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients who received diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus within the first 96 hours of hospitalization. EXPOSURE: We developed a logistic regression model from readily available electronic health record data to predict SARS-CoV-2 positivity in patients who were positive for COVID and those who were negative and never retested. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This model was applied to patients testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 who were retested within the first 96 hours of hospitalization. We evaluated the ability of the model to discriminate between patients who would subsequently retest negative and those who would subsequently retest positive. RESULTS: We included 31,459 hospitalized adult patients; 2,666 of these patients tested positive for COVID and 3,511 initially tested negative for COVID and were retested. Of the patients who were retested, 61 (1.7%) had a subsequent positive COVID test. The model showed that higher age, vital sign abnormalities, and lower white blood cell count served as strong predictors for COVID positivity in these patients. The model had moderate performance to predict which patients would retest positive with a test set area under the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) of 0.76 (95% CI 0.70-0.83). Using a cutpoint for our risk prediction model at the 90th percentile for probability, we were able to capture 35/61 (57%) of the patients who would retest positive. This cutpoint amounts to a number-needed-to-retest range between 15 and 77 patients. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: We show that a pragmatic model can predict which patients should be retested for COVID. Further research is required to determine if this risk model can be applied prospectively in hospitalized patients to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Ghazi, Lama; Simonov, Michael; Mansour, Sherry G; Moledina, Dennis G; Greenberg, Jason H; Yamamoto, Yu; Biswas, Aditya; Wilson, F Perry",PLoS One,,615

One of the early agents targeted for repurposing to treat and prevent COVID-19 was hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, HCQ is evaluated for its potential role in decreasing mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and medRxiv databases using combinations of the terms ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""coronavirus"", ""hydroxychloroquine"", and ""mortality"". Articles were selected for further review based on the content of their abstracts. Studies were excluded if they were of poor methodological quality, were not based in the inpatient setting, or did not have available data to assess the primary outcome of death between patients treated with HCQ versus standard of care. Once the final dataset was compiled, a meta-analysis using the random-effects model was performed. Our search identified 14 studies involving 24,780 patients of whom 12,707 patients were on HCQ alone or in combination with other adjuvant therapies. HCQ alone or in combination with other drugs did not significantly decrease mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.72-1.26; p = 0.732; I2 = 91.05). Similar findings were observed in all subgroup analyses. HCQ did not significantly impact mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Throughout this time, most parents continued to work remotely. The present research aimed at assessing multiple sociodemographic and psychological variables for parental well-being during the lockdown. An online survey was administered from 6 to 11 April 2020. Respondents were 917 parents aged 23-67 years with up to six children, aged 3-13 years. The measures employed were: 14 demographic questions, the Big Five Inventory (BFI-10), the Emotional Symptoms and Hyperactivity-Inattention subscales of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-P), and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Multiple moderated linear regression analyses were performed. Motherhood, higher levels of education, higher neuroticism, lower extroversion, and more child emotional and hyperactivity-inattention symptoms were found to be significant predictors of parent distress. Furthermore, a significant two-way interaction between child emotional problems and parent extroversion was found. Overall, parents showed high rates of psychological distress, signalling severe difficulties during the lockdown. Families with a child suffering from emotional and behavioural difficulties should immediately be detected by social services to activate support interventions to prevent chronic and amplified manifestations of these problems.","Mazza, Cristina; Marchetti, Daniela; Ricci, Eleonora; Fontanesi, Lilybeth; Di Giandomenico, Serena; Verrocchio, Maria Cristina; Roma, Paolo",Int J Psychol,,615
236265,Usefulness and acceptance of telephone monitoring by a virtual assistant for patients with COVID-19 following discharge,2021,"The negative impact of human activity has been known throughout history. The epic tale of Gilgamesh, Koranic and biblical texts all make clear the potential that humans have to destroy the world in which they live. Climate breakdown, biodiversity collapse and zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19 have also been predicted well in advance. The ""wicked problem"" (dilemma) to address is: ""Why do humans still persist in 'digging their own graves' by damaging the environments they inhabit?"" The author of this article argues that the motive to engage in education can be understood as an ancient human response to ecological change. This has led to a range of behaviours, including teaching and learning that serve only to further disrupt the relationship between the human and the ""more-than-human"" world. When formal education structures are viewed through a Marxian lens, it soon becomes clear that the unsustainable impact of humans on the more-than-human is the result of capitalist entrapment. Karl Marx's proposition of a metabolic rift helps make sense of the nonsensical, while a discussion of use and exchange value shows how formal education has become ensnared in the mire of capitalist productivity, concealing from view the educationally-induced destruction of planetary systems that support human flourishing. Fortunately, a more sustainable and sustaining education is possible - this is an education for a ""long-life"" that is no longer influenced by the machinery of neoliberalism.","Bainbridge, Alan",Int Rev Educ,,615

Even though he did not discover this reaction, it was through his studies that it became important in organic synthesis. Indeed, in honor of his work, the reaction became known as Huisgen's cycloaddition and it has been consolidated as a useful method for the preparation of five-membered heterocyclic compounds. Considering these facts, in this review we provide an overview on the applications of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions, starting with the seminal examples in the field and further discussing the most recent applications.","Gonzaga, D.

We aimed to determine if the antiplatelet effect of aspirin may mitigate risk of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and venous thromboembolism in COVID-19. We evaluated 22,072 symptomatic patients tested for COVID-19. Propensity-matched analyses were performed to determine if treatment with aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) affected thrombotic outcomes in COVID-19. Neither aspirin nor NSAIDs affected mortality in COVID-19. Thus, aspirin does not appear to prevent thrombosis and death in COVID-19. The mechanisms of thrombosis in COVID-19, therefore, appear distinct and the role of platelets as direct mediators of SARS-CoV-2-mediated thrombosis warrants further investigation.","Sahai, Aditya; Bhandari, Rohan; Godwin, Matthew; McIntyre, Thomas; Chung, Mina K; Iskandar, Jean-Pierre; Kamran, Hayaan; Hariri, Essa; Aggarwal, Anu; Burton, Robert; Kalra, Ankur; Bartholomew, John R; McCrae, Keith R; Elbadawi, Ayman; Bena, James; Svensson, Lars G; Kapadia, Samir; Cameron, Scott J",Vasc Med,,615

We aimed to assess the associated neurological manifestations with SARS CoV-2 infection. METHODS: In this systematic review, a search was carried out by key-electronic databases, controlled vocabulary, and indexing of trials to evaluate the available pertinent studies which included both medical subject headings (MeSH) and advance electronic databases comprising of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Peer-reviewed studies published in English and Spanish were considered which reported data on the neurological associations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes were nervous signs or symptoms; symptom severity; and diagnoses. FINDINGS: Our search identified 45 relevant studies, with 21 case reports, 3 case series, 9 observational studies, 1 retrospective study, 9 retrospective reviews, and 2 prospective reviews. This systematic review revealed that most commonly reported neuronal presentations involved headache, nausea, vomiting and muscular symptoms like fibromyalgia. Anosmia and ageusia, defects in clarity or sharpness of vision (error in visual acuity), and pain may occur in parallel. Notable afflictions in the form of anxiety, anger, confusion, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and post-intensive care syndrome were observed in individuals who were kept in quarantine and those with long-stay admissions in healthcare settings. SARS CoV-2 infection may result in cognitive impairment. Patients with more severe infection exhibited uncommon manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (intracerebral haemorrhage, stroke), rhabdomyolysis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 patients experience neuronal presentations varying with the progression of the infection. Healthcare professionals should be acquainted with the divergent neurological symptoms and to curb misdiagnosis and limit long term sequelae. Health-care planners and policymakers must prepare for this eventuality, while the ongoing studies increase our knowledge base on acute and chronic neurological associations of this pathogen.","Javed, Amaan","CNS neurol. disord., Drug targets (Online)",,615

The average weekly percentage changes in the number of deaths in 4 previous years were compared with those in the year 2020 using excess mortality analysis. RESULTS: The number of deaths in Istanbul was significantly higher in 2020 (p=0.001), with a 10% weekly increase between the 10th and 15th weeks, which started to decrease until the 20th week. The excess mortality found during the study period was 4,084 deaths, higher than the officially reported COVID-19 mortality.

Three hundred and four patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in our hospital within 5 months (April-August 2020) were examined. Laboratory values and demographic findings of the patients were analyzed retrospectively. Thirty-six patients were diagnosed with severe cases. The ratio of NLR, LMR, PLR, and LCR of patients with severe and those with nonsevere clinical symptoms were statistically analyzed. The NLR and PLR ratios of those with severe clinical symptoms were significantly higher (p < 0.001), the LCR rate was significantly lower (p < 0.001), and there was no significant difference in the LMR rate (p = 0.199). When we examined other peripheral blood parameters, we found that CRP was high, lymphocyte and monocyte were low (p < 0.001), but neutrophil (p = 0.416) and platelet (p = 0.998) were not statistically different between the groups. According to the results, routine blood values are abnormal in patients with COVID-19.

Results were compared by COVID-19 status and clinical course. RESULTS: In total 1,027 patients met inclusion criteria. Patients with COVID-19 (n = 155) had lower leukocytes (P < .0001), lymphocytes (P < .0001), platelets (P < .0001), and higher hemoglobin (P = .0140) than those without, but absolute differences were small. Serum albumin was lower in patients with COVID-19 (P < .0001) and serum albumin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and red cell distribution width (RDW) were each associated with disease severity. NLR did not differ between patients with COVID-19 and those without (P = .8012). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 had modestly lower leukocyte, lymphocyte, and platelet counts and higher hemoglobin values than patients without COVID-19.

METHODS: Charts of all 20 patients with COVID-19 ARDS admitted to the ICU of a German University Hospital during the first wave of the pandemic between 22/03/2020 and 21/04/2020 were reviewed. Among screened 333 days, isoflurane was used in 97 days, while in 187 days, propofol was used for 12 h or more. The effect and dose of these two sedatives were compared. Mixed sedation days were excluded. RESULTS: Patients' age (median [interquartile range]) was 64 (60-68) years. They were invasively ventilated for 36 [21-50] days. End-tidal isoflurane concentrations were high (0.96 ± 0.41 Vol %); multiple linear regression yielded the ratio (isoflurane infusion rate)/(minute ventilation) as the single best predictor. Infusion rates were decreased under ECMO (3.5 ± 1.4 versus 7.1 ± 3.2 mlâh-1; p < 0.001). In five patients, the maximum recommended dose of propofol of 4 mgâhour-1âkg-1ABW was exceeded on several days. On isoflurane compared to propofol days, neuro-muscular blocking agents (NMBAs) were used less frequently (11% versus 21%; p < 0.05), as were co-sedatives (7% versus 31%, p < 0.001); daily opioid doses were lower (720 [720-960] versus 1080 [720-1620] mg morphine equivalents, p < 0.001); and RASS scores indicated deeper levels of sedation (- 4.0 [- 4.0 to - 3.0] versus - 3.0 [- 3.6 to - 2.5]; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Isoflurane provided sufficient sedation with less NMBAs, less polypharmacy and lower opioid doses compared to propofol.

Italy was the European epicenter for virus spread and one with most cases and deaths. The first Italian patient was diagnosed on February 18th, a young man hospitalized in Lombardy (Northern Italy). The Italian government not only isolated the village where he lived, but a few days later put the entire country in lockdown. We have here analyzed the COVID-19 Italian data during the first three months after the outbreak and the effect of lockdown. COVID-19 virus has a high transmission rate and is associated with high fatality rate especially in the older population. The initial reproduction rate of the virus (R0) in Italy was between 2.1 and 3.3 in different Italian regions, with a doubling time between 2.7 and 3.2 days. The number of confirmed cases has now reached 229,000 but after the lockdown R0 is finally below 1. Despite the lockdown, the number of infected and deceased patients in Italy was very high, with a lethality rate higher than in other countries. It is likely that number of cases is underestimating the real since the number of asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic is relatively high. It is important to investigate which patients are more vulnerable and also if other co-factors can account for this high fatality rate, since this pandemia is far from being resolved.","Gastaldelli, Amalia; Gastaldelli, Mirco; Bastianoni, Simone",J Am Coll Nutr,,615

One obvious approach is to draw on our knowledge of the history of epidemics and proclaim the lessons of history. But does history offer clear lessons? To make their expertise relevant, some historians assert that there are enduring patterns in how societies respond to all epidemics that can inform our experiences today. Others argue that there are informative analogies between specific past epidemics and our present crisis, for instance between COVID-19 and prior outbreaks of SARS or influenza. Both strategies can be pursued, but each must be done with care. It is certainly possible to map COVID-19 onto the classic dramatic structure of an epidemic, but we cannot yet know how it will end, a failure of prognostication that constrains the advice we can offer. It is likewise possible to draw on the history of medical therapeutics and public health interventions to identify the risks we face of both underuse and overuse of our remedies, but we cannot yet judge whether our current commitment to heroic social distancing is warranted.

In this article, we discuss the pharmacokinetics and safety of chloroquine that should be considered in light of use in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Chloroquine is well absorbed and distributes extensively resulting in a large volume of distribution with an apparent and terminal half-life of 1.6 days and 2 weeks, respectively. Chloroquine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 and renal clearance is responsible for one third of total clearance. The lack of reliable information on target concentrations or doses for COVID-19 implies that for both adults and children, doses that proved effective and safe in malaria should be considered, such as 'loading doses' in adults (30 mg/kg over 48 h) and children (70 mg/kg over 5 days), which reported good tolerability. Here, plasma concentrations were < 2.5 µmol/L, which is associated with (minor) toxicity. While the influence of renal dysfunction, critical illness, or obesity seems small, in critically ill patients, reduced absorption may be anticipated. Clinical experience has shown that chloroquine has a narrow safety margin, as three times the adult therapeutic dosage for malaria can be lethal when given as a single dose. Although infrequent, poisoning in children is extremely dangerous where one to two tablets can potentially be fatal. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetic and safety properties of chloroquine suggest that chloroquine can be used safely for an acute virus infection, under corrected QT monitoring, but also that the safety margin is small, particularly in children.","Smit, Cornelis; Peeters, Mariska Y M; van den Anker, John N; Knibbe, Catherijne A J",Clin Pharmacokinet,,615
250374,Advice regarding COVID -19 pandemic for pulmonary function laboratories. SERChile. June 2020/ Recomendación sobre pruebas de función pulmonar durante la pandemia por coronavirus COVID-19. Junio 2020,2020,"In combating pandemics, more can be gained by changing citizens' behaviours than by relying solely on the medical route. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the struggle to contain the outbreak and push back new infection figures will ultimately be won by training citizens how to avoid creating secondary transmission chains. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the relationship between individual behaviour and group risk. Mass training of all social strata of a country's entire population is therefore critical in mitigating the pandemic. The authors of this article argue that adult learning and education (ALE) can play a pivotal role particularly in countries where average literacy levels are low, as these are usually the same countries in which healthcare systems are more fragile. This article explains why ALE, especially the promotion of health literacy as part of ALE (which is itself part of lifelong learning), is necessary to enable individuals to make informed health-related decisions. Research has shown that low- or non-literate individuals are less responsive to health education, less likely to use disease prevention services, and less likely to successfully manage chronic disease than literate citizens. The authors refer to the evaluation of the health literacy aspect of a large-scale adult literacy campaign launched in South Africa in 2008 which has yielded measurable outcomes and proved that the intervention had enabled adults to better understand health messages. They stress the importance of populations having at least a basic level of literacy and numeracy skills to enable them to receive and act on vital information during a pandemic or disaster. They argue that ALE should in fact be understood as an inherent element of every national emergency strategy, both in terms of prior preparation for possible future emergencies (such as pandemics, earthquakes, tornados, flooding, bushfires etc.), and in terms of reaction to a given emergency such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Lopes, Henrique; McKay, Veronica",Int Rev Educ,,615

253559,Major pandemics in the history of mankind,2020,"COVID-19 is a global health emergency facing many countries around the world. Sex workers in Africa are among one of the vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic on the continent. Sex workers are excluded from African government safety net, and this may force some sex workers back to sex work amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the nature of sex work, physical distancing and other precautionary measures are impossible to observe, further compromising COVID-19 response. Sex workers in Africa have been known to face high levels of stigma and discrimination, including limited access to healthcare services. Disruption in HIV care and prevention services due to the pandemic among this key population may have negative impacts on the hard-won achievements in HIV response in Africa. In addition, stigma and discrimination toward sex workers could also make contact tracing challenging and limit access to COVID-19 testing among this vulnerable group. With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for the UN Development Program, UN member states all pledged to ensure ""no one will be left behind"" and to ""endeavor to reach the furthest behind first."" This could not be more important than now as sex workers as a part of the population are left behind in COVID-19 response in Africa. It is important that the African government should ensure collective and inclusive response in the fight against COVID-19. Sex workers should not be forgotten in Africa's COVID-19 response because no one is safe, until all are safe.","Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Alaran, Aishat Jumoke; Akinokun, Rafiat Tolulope; Micheal, Alumuku Iordepuun; Ilesanmi, Esther Bosede; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,615

DATA SOURCES: Literature searches with keywords 'repurposing and cancer' books, websites: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, for drug structures: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Introducing approved drugs, such as those developed to treat diabetes (Metformin) or inflammation (Thalidomide), identified to have cytostatic activity, can enhance chemotherapy or even replace more cytotoxic drugs. Also, anti-inflammatory compounds, cytokines and inhibitors of proteolysis can be used to control the side effects of chemo- and immuno-therapies or as second-line treatments for tumors resistant to kinase inhibitors (KI). Drugs specifically developed for cancer therapy, such as interferons (IFN), the tyrosine KI abivertinib TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor inhibitors, may help control symptoms of Covid-19. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Better knowledge of mechanisms of drug activities is essential for repurposing. Chemotherapies induce ER stress and enhance mutation rates and chromosome alterations, leading to resistance that cannot always be related to mutations in the target gene. Metformin, thalidomide and cytokines (IFN, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and others) have pleiomorphic activities, some of which can enhance tumorigenesis. The small and fragile patient pools available for clinical trials can cloud the data on the usefulness of cotreatments. GROWING POINTS: Better understanding of drug metabolism and mechanisms should aid in repurposing drugs for primary, adjuvant and adjunct treatments.

BACKGROUND: In evidence-based practice, nursing decision-making is based on scientific evidence, evidence of best practice and individual patient preferences. Little is known about how nurses in hospitals take into account patient preferences in nursing decision-making. DESIGN: Qualitative grounded theory. METHODS: Data collection entailed 27 semi-structured interviews with nurses designated by their colleagues as excellent caregivers, followed by 57 hours of participant observation. Data analysis was conducted using three-level coding with constant comparison and theoretical sampling. The COREQ checklist for qualitative research was followed. RESULTS: A main finding was that participants used three implicit tools to discover patient preferences: establishing a connection, using antennae and asking empathic questions, thus instantly reassuring patients from the very first contact. Their starting point in care was the patient's perception of quality of life wherein they shifted towards their patient's perspective: ""Teach me to provide the best care for you in this situation."" During the observations, it was confirmed that the excellent nurses behaved as they had described before. CONCLUSION: Excellent nurses actively turn towards patients' expectations and experienced quality of life by carefully blending individual sensitive and situation specific patient preferences with scientific evidence and evidence of best practice. In doing so, they are able to balancing more equally patient preferences in to the equation called evidence-based practice, thus leading to wise decision-making in personalised nursing care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Patient preferences become a fully fledged part of nursing decision-making in EBP when in education and practice, the implicit knowledge of excellent nurses about how to take into account patient preferences to provide personalised care is more valued and taught.","den Hertog, Ria; Niessen, Theo",J. clin. nurs,,615

Apart from acute pulmonary syndrome, Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) can increasingly induce chronic conditions. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 triggers de novo type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) linked to age-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancers, and neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 induces inflammation, possibly through damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signaling and 'cytokine storm', causing insulin resistance and the adiponectin (APN) paradox, a phenomenon linking metabolic dysfunction to chronic disease. Accordingly, preventing the APN paradox by suppressing APN-related inflammatory signaling might prove beneficial. A better understanding could uncover novel therapies for SARS-CoV-2 and its chronic disorders.","Ho, Gilbert; Ali, Alysha; Takamatsu, Yoshiki; Wada, Ryoko; Masliah, Eliezer; Hashimoto, Makoto",Drug discov. today,,615

Strict measures to control the spread of COVID-19 have meant that important aspects of therapy in the Eden Unit are no longer permissible. It is not known whether handicaps to providing the previous service are reflected in recent outcomes.MethodValues for age, length of stay (LOS), BMI, HbA1c (diabetic patients) and responses to three questionnaires: Eating Disorder Evaluation Questionnaire (EDE-Q);Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)-21;and Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE). This data were collected for April 2020 to February 2021 (Pandemic) and compared with five preceding years, April 2015 to March 2020 (Pre-COVID). The project was registered with NHS Grampian Quality Assurance Team and approved by the MCN Quality Assurance subgroup. Ethical approval was not required. A data collection sheet allowed anonymised data to be entered into a Microsoft Excel TM Spreadsheet for analysis of baseline demographics.ResultAverage age of patients remained similar across the six years. Length of stay in the first year of the pandemic was significantly shortened. BMI on discharge in 2020/21 remained similar to preceding years. If relevant, HbA1c was measured throughout admission and comparison with BMI change reflected a focus on treating both diabetes and ED concurrently. Comparison of admission and discharge questionnaires to determine outcome measures proved difficult due to the small number of responses to both.ConclusionShorter LOS during the pandemic was a significant finding. Despite this, BMI on discharge remained similar, suggesting a shift to weight restoration due to lack of opportunities for an holistic approach due to restrictions. Key elements of treatment include careful monitoring of HbA1c and concurrent management of Type I Diabetes for those patients. The low response rate to questionnaires raises concern regarding their use, in their current format, as effective tools to measure outcomes. Though low numbers of questionnaire responses prevent firm conclusion, it appears that the reduced opportunities for elements of treatment to be undertaken in the community may have contributed to increased anxiety levels on discharge.","Cross, Emma Morris Jane",BJPsych Open,,615

COVID-19 infection’s main symptoms are fever, cough, fatigue, and neurological manifestations such as headache, myalgias, anosmia, ageusia, impaired consciousness, seizures, and even neuromuscular junctions’ disorders. In addition, it is known that this disease causes a series of systemic complications such as adverse respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, and liver dysfunction. Due to the neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19, damage in the central nervous system has been suggested as well as the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2. It is known that CoV infections are associated with an inflammation process related to the imbalance of the antioxidant system;cellular changes caused by oxidative stress contribute to brain tissue damage. Although anti-COVID-19 vaccines are under development, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 and its clinical manifestations and complications;only supportive treatments with immunomodulators, anti-vascular endothelial growth factors, modulating drugs, statins, or nutritional supplements have been used.

Bats are known to be the primary animal reservoir for coronaviruses. However, in the past few decades, the virus has been able to mutate and adapt to infect humans, resulting in an animal-to-human species barrier jump. The emergence of a novel coronavirus poses a serious global public health threat and possibly carries the potential of causing a major pandemic outbreak in the naïve human population. The recent outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has infected over 36.5 million individuals and claimed over one million lives worldwide, as of 8 October 2020. The novel virus is rapidly spreading across China and has been transmitted to 213 other countries/territories across the globe. Researchers have reported that the virus is constantly evolving and spreading through asymptomatic carriers, further suggesting a high global health threat.

não apenas empresas estatais, mas também agências de desenvolvimento e fundos públicos - pode promover experimentação e ajuste nos processos de produção para aumentar a infraestrutura e capacidade de prevenção e tratamento Ações potenciais incluem esforços público-privados buscando descoberta e coordenação - como esforços colaborativos para desenvolver tecnologias de prevenção e tratamento, além de injeções de capital para estimular o reequipamento e a expansão da infraestrutura estratégica O aparato estatal também pode ajudar a acessar áreas remotas e críticas, com retornos privados relativamente mais baixos Por outro lado, apoio seletivo às indústrias deve ser implementado com cautela, especialmente em setores cuja demanda pode sofrer alterações permanentes devido a mudanças no estilo de vida Para evitar o risco de perpetuar apoio estatal injustificado e ineficaz, estratégias de saída devem ser elaboradas com cuidado, com marcos e cláusulas de término com base em indicadores de desempenho Embora o uso do aparato estatal como contramedida acarrete seu próprio conjunto de riscos, talvez paradoxalmente não utilizá-lo também aumente o risco de estender a crise e acabar com um setor estadual inchado (por exemplo, devido a resgates maciços), tornando mais difícil a implementação de ajustes subsequentes","Lazzarini, Sérgio Giovanetti Musacchio Aldo",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,615
264031,The management of scarce life supports in pandemic contexts. Reflections on the application of triage within the COVID-19 framework,2020,"Sweden stands out among the other European countries by the degree of restrictive measures taken towards handling the 2019 coronavirus outbreak, associated with the CoViD-19 pandemic. While several governments have imposed a nationwide total or partial lockdown to slow down the spread of the virus, the Swedish government has opted for a recommendation-based approach together with a few imposed restrictions. In a previous contribution by the authors, the impact of the Swedish strategy was observed through the monitored variation of the city noise levels during a period associated with the so-called ""first wave"" of the pandemic in Stockholm. A very strong impact of these recommendations was shown on the evolution of the noise levels in central Stockholm. This highlighted the potential of acoustic sensor networks both for enforcement of regulation and monitoring of the effectiveness of their implementation. The present contribution presents a follow-up to this urban noise monitoring in central Stockholm, Sweden, for the period leading to the so-called ""second wave"" of the pandemic in Europe. Both the evolution of adherence to the recommendations and the impact of the recurrence of cases combined with reinforced recommendations are observed through the evolution of the measured noise levels. While the measurements show a gradual lower level of compliance, in particular, past the summer break, these also show again a rapid response to the reinforced recommendations issued by the authorities in mid-fall of 2020. These observations thus confirm the potential associated with detailed urban noise monitoring, for instance here acting as a proxy to evaluating the response to recommendations or restrictions in times of crisis.","Rumpler, Romain; Venkataraman, Siddharth; Göransson, Peter",J Acoust Soc Am,,615

Using a sample of 22 emerging economies, our results provide evidence regarding the existence of threshold effects between inflation and public debt. Specifically, we find that emerging countries with a relatively low shadow economy can accommodate increases in public debt without the additional welfare costs that are associated with higher inflation. In contrast, those countries where the shadow economy exceeds 24.3% of GDP face greater macroeconomic costs in terms of inflation. Consequently, they have less room for manoeuvre when dealing with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic","Dumitrescu, Bogdan Andrei Kagitci Meral Cepoi Cosmin-Octavian",Finance Research Letters,,615

METHODS: This prospective two-center study investigated early progression of CAV by coronary optical coherence tomography in 1 month and 12 months after heart transplantation (HTx) in 104 patients. Detection and characterization of donor specific (DSA) and MHC class-I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) antibodies were performed before, 1, 6 and 12 months after transplantation. RESULTS: During the first post-HTx year, we observed a significant reduction in the mean coronary luminal area (P < .001), and progression in mean intimal thickness (IT) (P < .001). DSA and anti-MICA occurred in 17% of all patients, but no significant relationship was observed between presence of DSA/anti-MICA and IT progression within 12 months after HTx. In contrast, we observed significant association between presence of DSA (p=0.031), de-novo DSA (p=0.031), HLA Class II DSA (p=0.017) and media thickness (MT) progression. CONCLUSION: Results of our study did not identify a direct association between presence of DSA/anti-MICA and intimal thickness progression in an early period after HTx. However, we found significant relationships between DSA and media thickness progression that may identify a newly recognized immune-pathological aspect of CAV.","Michal, Pazdernik; Helena, Bedanova; Zhi, Chen; Josef, Kautzner; Vojtech, Melenovsky; Ivan, Malek; Antonij, Slavcev; Michaela, Bartonova; Vladimir, Karmazin; Tomas, Eckhardt; Ales, Tomasek; Eva, Ozabalova; Tomas, Kovarnik; Peter, Wohlfahrt; Milan, Sonka",Transpl Immunol,,615

OBJECTIVE: To describe and compare the hospital course for COVID-19 patients with dementia to an aging cohort without dementia in a large New York City academic medical center. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study describing all consecutive patients age 65 or older with confirmed COVID-19 who presented to the emergency department or were hospitalized at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center between March 6 and April 7, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 531 patients were evaluated, including 116 (21.8%) with previously diagnosed dementia, and 415 without dementia. Patients with dementia had higher mortality (50.0%versus 35.4%, pâ=â0.006); despite similar comorbidities and complications, multivariate analysis indicated the association was dependent on age, sex, comorbidities, and code status. Patients with dementia more often presented with delirium (36.2%versus 11.6%, pâ<â0.001) but less often presented with multiple other COVID-19 symptoms, and these findings remained after adjusting for age and sex. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with dementia had higher mortality, but dementia was not an independent risk factor for death. These patients were approximately 3 times more likely to present with delirium but less often manifested or communicated other common COVID-19 symptoms. For this high-risk population in a worsening pandemic, understanding the unique manifestations and course in dementia and aging populations may help guide earlier diagnosis and optimize medical management.","Harb, Amro A; Chen, RuiJun; Chase, Herbert S; Natarajan, Karthik; Noble, James M",J Alzheimers Dis,,615

The scale evaluates the emotional responses to COVID-19. To date, the FCV-19S has been translated and validated in about 20 languages and has been used in many published research. The current study aimed to validate the Polish version of the FCV-19S. Method The FCV-19S was translated into Polish using forward- and back-translation. From May 15th to June 15th 2020, a total of 708 community members (Sample 1: 383 persons, 209 females, Sample 2: 325 persons, 198 females) participated in the online study. The participants were recruited using online advertisements in social media. Participation was anonymous, voluntary, and without compensation. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the one-factor structure of the FCV-19S. Then, measurement invariance was analyzed across samples, gender and age groups. To assess the validity of the scale, correlations between the FCV-19S and the remaining scales were computed. Results Internal consistency of the FCV-19S was good in both samples (Cronbach’s alpha 0.89 and 0.85). The CFA showed that the one-factor model fits the data well (RMSEA = 0.067, 90% CI [0.059–0.094], CFI = 0.977, TLI = 0.965, GFI = 0.986). The criteria for configural, metric, scalar and strict invariance were met for all models tested. The FCV-19S scores correlated significantly with age, subjective vulnerability to the disease, neuroticism, self-reported compliance with the pandemic measures, and three kinds of preventive behavior (i.e., social distancing, hand hygiene, and disinfecting things). Conclusion The Polish version of the FCV-19S had a unidimensional structure, good reliability, and correlated as predicted with other variables. With the FCV-19S and the obtained results, healthcare professionals, researchers, and the government can gain more valuable information about people who may be at risk for negative psychological outcomes during the pandemic or who are not implementing protective behavior. The tool can be used in hospitals to quickly screen the level of fear in patients and minimize its severe adverse consequences.","Pilch, Irena Kurasz Zofia Turska-Kawa Agnieszka",PeerJ,,615

This study investigates relationship between total severity score by first chest CT and the outcome of coronavirus COVID-19 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). RESULTS: A total of 48 patients with a history of CAD (mean age=60.83±3.06 years, 75% male) with positive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 were included. Outcome was defined as acute respiratory distress syndrome or death. The unadjusted and adjusted effects of the CT score on the outcome were reported through odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Outcome occurred in 17 (35.5%) patients (8 deaths). The CT score was directly and significantly correlated with the outcome in the univariate analysis (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12-1.70; P=0.003) and remained significant after adjustment for diabetes, hypertension, body mass index, and serum level of highly sensitive C-reactive protein (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.11-2.05; P=0.009).

280997,Food and nutrition in pediatric ages during the covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is considered a widespread concern in global public health. Diagnoses of COVID-19 in some cases are necessary because of severe prognosis. In this study, epidemiologies, clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 were studied in Taleghani Hospital, Urmia, Iran. METHODS: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was carried out on 215 patients with COVID-19 during March and April 2020. Approved COVID-19 case was considered as a person with a positive respiratory sample performed by at least one of two RT-PCR methods or genetic sequencing. ANOVA repeated measure, independent t-test and logistic regression were done. A P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 50.93 ± 17.92 years. Regarding gender, there were 91 females (42.3%) and 124 males (57.7%). The mean hospital stay, the temperature at admission, and onset of symptoms were 4.91 ± 3.68 days, 37.40 ± 0.96°C and 5.88 ± 4.80 days, respectively. Close contact with suspected people was found in 10.2% of patients. Additionally, 44 patients (20.5%) were smokers. Shortness of breath and cough were found in 62.8% and 49.3% of patients. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were the most common comorbidities of patients. Regarding lung involvement, 33 patients (33%) were normal, most of the patients (n = 71) had 5%-25% involvement in their lung and a minority of patients (n = 13) had a severe condition of 50%-75% lung involvement. The association between smoking and mortality was tested using chi-square showing no significant difference (X2 :2.959, P = .085). There was no significant difference between AST, ALT, ALP, total, direct Bilirubin, lung involvement and suffering from fever (P > .05). High Spo2 can increase the chance of recovery by 24% with each unit reduction. Kidney involvement increases the chance of death by about 80% (95% CI: 0.104-0.013). The odds ratio of spo2 for recovery of COVID-19 was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.014-1.528; P = .037). Kaletra with odds ratio of 31.960 had the most highest effect on recovery following COVID-19 (P = .043). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 involves different organs of the body with different severity. In the meantime, smoking was not a risk factor for the virus or associated with severe manifestations of the disease. Patients with high creatinine and CPK, pulmonary involvement above 25%, and hypoxemia had a higher mortality rate. Increase of Spo2 by 1% can improve the patients by 24%. The results indicated that Kaletra had the most highest effect on improvement following COVID-19.","Gharebaghi, Naser; Farshid, Saman; Boroofeh, Behdad; Nejadrahim, Rahim; Mousavi, Jalil; Dindarian, Sina; Mohammadi, Sedra",Int J Clin Pract,,615

281094,8-2 An Online Program on Social Determinants of Health Attempted as an Alternative to Community Medicine Practicum under the Self-Restraint due to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Loneliness is associated with multiple forms of psychopathology in youth. However, we do not yet know how loneliness gets ""under the skin"" in ways that may impact the long-term health and development of early adolescents. In particular, loneliness may influence youths' patterns of diurnal cortisol, an index of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning and a central predictor of health across the lifespan. The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19) pandemic represents a salient period in which to study the consequences of loneliness, as recent work has provided evidence that the physical-distancing measures put in place to contain the virus have resulted in greater loneliness, particularly among youth. Thus, the current study aimed to examine the prospective association between loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic and diurnal cortisol in early adolescents. We found that greater loneliness was associated with higher levels of cortisol at waking and a blunted cortisol awakening response (CAR). These results held even when controlling for covariates that can influence diurnal trajectories of cortisol. Critically, this pattern of HPA-axis functioning increases risk for adverse mental and physical health outcomes across adolescence and into adulthood. This study is the first to examine the prospective association between loneliness and diurnal cortisol in early adolescence, and the first to identify mechanisms that contribute to biological markers of distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings underscore the importance of developing and distributing strategies to mitigate feelings of loneliness among youth.","Jopling, Ellen; Rnic, Katerina; Tracy, Alison; LeMoult, Joelle",Psychoneuroendocrinology,,615

While optimists foresee the continuation of economic globalization after the pandemic, pessimists expect localization instead of globalization, given the pandemic's structural negative consequence on the world economy. By contrast, the centrists anticipate a ""U-shaped"" recovery, where Covid-19 will not kill globalization but slow it down. The three existing perspectives on Covid-19's impact on the economic globalization are not without merit, but they do not take sufficient temporal distance from the ongoing issue. This article suggests employing the historical perspective to expand the time frame by examining the rise and fall of economic globalization before and after the 2008 global financial crisis. The authors argue that economic globalization has been in transition since the 2008 financial crisis, and one important but not exclusive factor to explain this change is the evolving US-China economic relationship, from symbiotic towards increasingly competitive. The economic restructuring in US and China has begun after both countries weathered the 2008 crisis and gained momentum since the outbreak of trade war and Covid-19. The article investigates this trend by distinguishing different types of production activities, and the empirical results confirm that localization and regionalization have been filling the vacuum of economic globalization in retreat in the last decade.","Wang, Zhaohui; Sun, Zhiqiang",J Chin Polit Sci,,615

More worrisome, some may be experiencing early signs or symptoms, yet they are not seeking evaluation, treatment or surveillance examinations. The long-term impact of this on patients, families and health care providers will be substantial. Not only will this strain sophisticated health systems in developed countries, but it will also overwhelm the health care infrastructure in developing countries. Health-care executives, cancer center directors, oncologists and policy experts should focus now on serving this potential ""third wave"" of sick patients who have delayed treatment. Stopping COVID-19 is critical. However, it's also essential to plan for the coming wave of patients who have delayed seeking care or don't have access.","Meyer, Michael; Bindelglas, Ethan; Kupferman, Michael E; Eggermont, Alexander Mm",Ecancermedicalscience,,615

How the defects in this system might result in autoimmunity is discussed in this review. Reduced lymphocyte number, termed lymphopenia, can mediate lymphopenia-induced proliferation (LIP) to maintain peripheral lymphocyte numbers. LIP not only occurs in normal physiological conditions but also correlates with autoimmunity. Of note, lymphopenia is also a typical marker of immune aging, consistent with the fact that not only the autoimmunity increases in the elderly, but also autoimmune diseases (ADs) show characteristics of immune aging. Here, we discuss the types and rates of LIP in normal and autoimmune conditions, as well as the coronavirus disease 2019 in the context of LIP. Importantly, although the causative role of LIP has been demonstrated in the development of type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, a two-hit model has suggested that the factors other than lymphopenia are required to mediate the loss of control over homeostasis to result in ADs. Interestingly, these factors may be, if not totally, related to the function/number of regulatory T cells which are key modulators to protect from self-reactivity. In this review, we summarize the important roles of lymphopenia/LIP and the Treg cells in various autoimmune conditions, thereby highlighting them as key therapeutic targets for autoimmunity treatments.","Sheu, Ting-Ting; Chiang, Bor-Luen",Int. j. mol. sci.

A case-based review was performed to present real-life experiences in terms of main findings and treatment options. We described two cases with the diagnosis of MIS and searched the literature to review all reported &#8805; 18-year-old cases. The PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched. All relevant articles from January 2020 to February 2021 were reviewed. An adolescent and an adult patient (18 and 40 years-old, respectively) with the diagnosis of MIS were presented. Both had the consistent clinical findings with the case definition criteria. Although steroid, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and supportive care treatments have been suggested in the literature, there exists no treatment guideline for MIS-A. The clinical and laboratory findings of the patients progressively improved with the implementation of the IVIG and the pulse steroid treatments. A total of 51 cases (&#8805; 18 years-old) with MIS were analyzed. Mean age was 29.4 ± 10 years. Fever (80.4%), gastrointestinal (72.5%), and respiratory symptoms (54.9%) were the predominant symptoms. Cardiovascular abnormalities were the most frequent reported findings (82.4%, 42/51). The dermatological and conjunctival findings were reported in 39.2% and 35.3% of the patients, respectively. The increased level of inflammatory biomarkers was remarkable. Most of the patients were treated successfully with steroid and IVIG. Clinicians managing adult patients should keep in mind the development risk of MIS related with SARS-CoV-2 infection to perform necessary interventions properly without delay. IVIG and pulse steroid treatments are the effective options on clinical improvement.","Bastug, Aliye; Aslaner, Halide; Aybar Bilir, Yesim; Kemirtlek, Nizamettin; Gursoy, Fahriye Melis; Bastug, Serdal; Bodur, Hurrem",Rheumatol Int,,615

283301,Pakistan: making a “COVID budget” in a struggling economy,2020,"Background: Addressing the mental health needs of cancer patients and their caregivers improves the quality of care the patient receives in any cancer care ecosystem. International practice currently encourages integrated care for physical and mental health in oncology. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the delivery of healthcare services across the world. The current research paper is on the psycho-oncology service provision for hospitalised cancer patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: All patients who were referred to psycho-oncology services during the study period of 1 month, in the two successive years of 2019 and 2020, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected from the centralised electronic medical records for patients. Data included cancer diagnosis, reason for admission, admitting team and reason for a psychiatric referral. Other parameters that were measured were the timing of the psychiatric assessment, psychiatric diagnosis and psycho-oncology care provided, which included psychological interventions carried out and medications prescribed. The overall institutional data on cancer care provision are also presented in brief to provide context to the psycho-oncology services. Results: Integrated psycho-oncology services reviewed and managed patients round the year in the hospital where the study was conducted. During the 1-month study period, in 2019 and 2020, the total number of hospitalised cancer patients managed by the services was 74 and 52, respectively. During the study period of 2020, 292 patients with cancer who were being treated in the hospital had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tested on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 50 members of healthcare staff also tested positive. The most common diagnosis of patients was found to be stress-related adjustment disorder [16/74 (21.6%) in 2019 and 16/52 (30.8%) in 2020]. The paper discusses the common stressors voiced by the patients and their caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several challenges of providing psychological services were overcome by the team and the paper touches upon the common strategies that were used during the pandemic. Most patients did not need medications, but a significant minority did benefit from treatment with psychotropic medications. Simple psychological interventions such as sleep hygiene, supportive therapy sessions and psycho-education benefited many patients and were feasible even during the pandemic. Conclusion: The provision of psycho-oncology services to cancer patients and their caregivers was important before and during the COVID19 pandemic.","Mukherjee, A.; Chatterjee, M.; Chattopadhyay, S.; Bhowmick, C.; Basu, A.; Bhattacharjee, S.; Ghose, S.; Datta, S.

It has been widely adopted by both end-users and organizations, posting their personal experiences or expressing their opinion during significant events and periods of crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the search for effective vaccine treatment. We identify the three major companies involved in vaccine research and extract their Instagram posts, after vaccination has started, as well as users’ reception using respective hashtags, constructing the datasets. Statistical differences regarding the companies are initially presented, on textual, as well as visual features, i.e., image classification by transfer learning. Appropriate preprocessing of English language posts and content analysis is subsequently performed, by automatically annotating the posts as one of four intent classes, thus facilitating the training of nine classifiers for a potential application capable of predicting user’s intent. By designing and carrying out a controlled experiment we validate that the resulted algorithms’ accuracy ranking is significant, identifying the two best performing algorithms;this is further improved by ensemble techniques. Finally, polarity analysis on users’ posts, leveraging a convolutional neural network, reveals a rather neutral to negative sentiment, with highly polarized user posts’ distributions.","Amanatidis, Dimitrios Mylona Ifigeneia Kamenidou Irene Mamalis Spyridon Stavrianea Aikaterini",Applied Sciences,,615

We performed a genome-wide analysis of circulating blood DNA CpG methylation using the Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip on 124 blood samples from hospitalized COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients and compared these data with previously reported data from 39 healthy individuals collected before the pandemic. Prospective outcome measures such as COVID-19-GRAM risk-score and mortality were combined with methylation data. RESULTS: Global mean methylation levels did not differ between COVID-19 patients and healthy pre-pandemic controls. About 75% of acute illness-associated differentially methylated regions were located near gene promoter regions and were hypo-methylated in comparison with healthy pre-pandemic controls. Gene ontology analyses revealed terms associated with the immune response to viral infections and leukocyte activation; and disease ontology analyses revealed a predominance of autoimmune disorders. Among COVID-19-positive patients, worse outcomes were associated with a prevailing hyper-methylated status. Recursive feature elimination identified 77 differentially methylated positions predictive of COVID-19 severity measured by the GRAM-risk score. CONCLUSION: Our data contribute to the awareness that DNA methylation may influence the expression of genes that regulate COVID-19 progression and represent a targetable process in that setting.","Balnis, Joseph; Madrid, Andy; Hogan, Kirk J; Drake, Lisa A; Chieng, Hau C; Tiwari, Anupama; Vincent, Catherine E; Chopra, Amit; Vincent, Peter A; Robek, Michael D; Singer, Harold A; Alisch, Reid S; Jaitovich, Ariel",Clin Epigenetics,,615

A scoping review of the literature with compiled recommendations is a useful tool for arthroplasty surgeons as they resume their orthopedic practices during the pandemic. Methods: In June 2020, PubMed, Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Library (Wiley), Scopus, LitCovid, CINAHL, medRxiv, and bioRxiv were queried for articles using controlled vocabulary and keywords pertaining to COVID-19 and total joint arthroplasty. Studies were characterized by their region of origin, design, and CEBM level of evidence. The identified relevant studies were grouped into six categories: changes to future clinical workflow, education, impact on patients, impact on surgeons, technology, and surgical volume. Results: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on arthroplasty practice, including the disruption of the clinical teaching environment, personal and financial consequences for patients and physicians, and the drastic reduction in surgical volume. New pathways for clinical workflow have emerged, along with novel technologies with applications for both patients and trainees. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the recent trend in arthroplasty toward risk stratification and outpatient surgery, which may result in improved clinical outcomes and significant cost-savings. Further, virtual technologies are a promising area of future focus that may ultimately improve upon previous existing inefficiencies in the education and clinical environments.","Chen, Aaron Z; Shen, Tony S; Bovonratwet, Patawut; Pain, Kevin J; Murphy, Alexander I; Su, Edwin P",,,615

However, LUS remains limited to the visual inspection of ultrasound data, thus negatively affecting the reliability and reproducibility of the findings. Moreover, many different imaging protocols have been proposed, most of which lacked proper clinical validation. To address these problems, we were the first to propose a standardized imaging protocol and scoring system. Next, we developed the first deep learning (DL) algorithms capable of evaluating LUS videos providing, for each video-frame, the score as well as semantic segmentation. Moreover, we have analyzed the impact of different imaging protocols and demonstrated the prognostic value of our approach. In this work, we report on the level of agreement between the DL and LUS experts, when evaluating LUS data. The results show a percentage of agreement between DL and LUS experts of 85.96% in the stratification between patients at high risk of clinical worsening and patients at low risk. These encouraging results demonstrate the potential of DL models for the automatic scoring of LUS data, when applied to high quality data acquired accordingly to a standardized imaging protocol.","Mento, Federico; Perrone, Tiziano; Fiengo, Anna; Smargiassi, Andrea; Inchingolo, Riccardo; Soldati, Gino; Demi, Libertario",J Acoust Soc Am,,615

The risk to restarting activities is unknown. Objective Assess the risk of SARS-Cov-2 virus contagion, both to patients and healthcare workers in relation to esophageal and anorectal functional tests during the pandemic without protective measures. Method A questionnaire was designed to find out whether patients and healthcare workers had COVID-19, confirmed either by a test or only compatible symptoms, after functional studies were performed from January until March 2020. Results 263 (92.9%) patients answered the survey. In the two weeks after functional test, four (1.52%) patients had confirmed COVID-19 (adjusted rate 8.34 cases per 1,000 (95% CI -0.06-16.74), OR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.83-0.85), p<0.001), no one after anorectal manometry. Other five had only compatible symptoms, total 9 (3.42%) (adjusted rate 27.50 cases / 1,000 (95% CI: 7.27-47.74), OR 2.84 (95% CI: 2.81-2.87).

The average of days between the procedure and the first day of symptoms was progressively shortened: January 56 days, February 33 days, March 10.5 days. Two out of 10 healthcare workers (20%) were confirmed with COVID-19. Conclusions The risk of COVID-19 contagion when performing functional tests is low and more related to the evolution of the pandemic than to the procedures themselves. The small number of healthcare workers included in the study does not allow a definitive conclusion to be drawn on their risk of contagion.","Pérez de la Serna Y Bueno, Julio; Ruiz de León San Juan, Antonio; Sevilla Mantilla, Concepción; Ciriza de Los Ríos, Constanza; Atarain Valles, Ana; Aparicio Cabezudo, Marta; García Pravia, Laura; Olivares Quintanar, David; Rey Díaz-Rubio, Enrique",Rev. esp. enferm. dig,,615

In this paper, we leverage a computational approach recently developed by our group to study the interactions between nanoparticles and mammalian membranes to study the time of entry of a variety of drugs into the viral envelope of coronavirus as well as cellular organelles. Using a combination of all-atoms molecular dynamics simulations and statistical analysis, we consider both drug characteristics and membrane properties to determine the behavior of 79 drugs and their interactions with the viral envelope, composed of the membrane and spike protein, as well as five other membranes that correspond to various mammalian compartments (lysosome, plasma, Golgi, mitochondrial, and endoplasmic reticulum membranes). The results highlight important trends that can be exploited for drug design, from the relatively high permeability of the viral envelope and the effect of transmembrane proteins, to the differences in permeability between organelles. When compared with bioavailability data present in the literature, the model results suggest a negative correlation between time of permeation and bioavailability of promising drugs. The method is general and flexible and can be employed for a variety of molecules, from small drugs to small nanoparticles, as well to a variety of biological membranes. Overall, the results indicate that this model can contribute to the identification of successful drugs as it predicts the ability of compounds to reach both intended and unintended intracellular targets.","Liu, Changjiang; Elvati, Paolo; Violi, Angela",J Phys Chem Lett,,615

As for now, data on the efficacy of NIV in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are lacking, and for this reason it is extremely important to accurately determine the outcomes of this strategy. This study aimed to evaluate clinical data and outcomes of NIV in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. MATHERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients with sudden worsening of respiratory failure were evaluated. All patients (71% male) had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and signs, symptoms and radiological findings compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia and all of them underwent a trial of NIV. Primary outcomes were NIV success and failure defined by intubation and mortality rate. Secondary outcome was the duration of NIV. RESULTS: NIV was successful in 38 (48.1%) patients (Table 1). EOT was necessary in 21 patients (26.6%). Death occurred in 20 patients (25.3%). In the group of patients having failed a trial with NIV and then being intubated, compared to those who continued NIV, there was no higher mortality rate. By evaluating the ICU survival outcome of the subgroup of patients intubated after NIV, 57% of the patients were discharged and 43% died. CONCLUSION: Previous studies conducted on patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation showed higher mortality rate than the present study. Our data showed that NIV can avoid intubation in almost half of the patients. Therefore, this data could reassure clinicians who would consider using NIV in COVID-19 ARDS-related treatment.","Menzella, Francesco; Barbieri, Chiara; Fontana, Matteo; Scelfo, Chiara; Castagnetti, Claudia; Ghidoni, Giulia; Ruggiero, Patrizia; Livrieri, Francesco; Piro, Roberto; Ghidorsi, Luca; Montanari, Gloria; Gibellini, Giorgia; Casalini, Eleonora; Falco, Francesco; Catellani, Chiara; Facciolongo, Nicola",Clin Respir J,,615

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective validation study assesses patients infected with COVID-19, in whom blood samples are prospectively collected. Recruited patients include a range of infection severity from asymptomatic to critically ill patients, recruited from the community, outpatient clinics, emergency departments and hospitals. Study samples consist of peripheral blood samples collected into RNA-preserving (PAXgene/Tempus) tubes on patient presentation or immediately on study enrolment. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) will be performed on total RNA extracted from collected blood samples using primers specific to host response gene expression biomarkers that have been previously identified in studies of respiratory viral infections. The RT-PCR data will be analysed to assess the diagnostic performance of individual biomarkers in predicting COVID-19-related outcomes, such as viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome or bacterial pneumonia. Biomarker performance will be evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This research protocol aims to study the host response gene expression biomarkers in severe respiratory viral infections with a pandemic potential (COVID-19). It has been approved by the local ethics committee with approval number 2020/ETH00886. The results of this project will be disseminated in international peer-reviewed scientific journals.","Tang, Benjamin; Shojaei, Maryam; Wang, Ya; Nalos, Marek; Mclean, Anthony; Afrasiabi, Ali; Kwan, Tim N; Kuan, Win Sen; Zerbib, Yoann; Herwanto, Velma; Gunawan, Gunawan; Bedognetti, Davide; Zoppoli, Gabriele; Ballestrero, Alberto; Rinchai, Darawan; Cremonesi, Paolo; Bedognetti, Michele; Matejovic, Martin; Karvunidis, Thomas; Macdonald, Stephen P J; Cox, Amanda J; West, Nicholas P; Cripps, Allan William; Schughart, Klaus; Maria, Andrea de; Chaussabel, Damien; Iredell, Jonathan; Weng, Stephen",BMJ Open,,615

These transitions have been first driven by the recognition that generalizations of space and population in conventional epidemic modelling may have hampered the effectiveness of the modelling; they then have been supported by increasingly available data that allow depiction of detailed spatiotemporal characteristics of an epidemic, as well as those characteristics of the environment in both human and natural aspects; and finally they have been facilitated by developments in geographic information science, data science, computer science, and computing technologies. Based on a review of a variety of recently developed communicable disease models, we explicitly put forward the notions of spatialization and individualization in this area, and point out that the integration of the two is the future of communicable disease modelling. We also point out that in this area models based on the object conceptualization are good at modelling spatiotemporal process, whereas models based on the field conceptualization are good at representing spatialized information. We propose a procedural framework of epidemic modelling that implements the integration of individualization and spatialization, integration of object-based process and field-based representation, and integration of modelling that retrospectively traces infection relationships based on historical patient data and modelling that prospectively predicts such relationships of future epidemics.","Li, Meifang; Shi, Xun; Li, Xia",Annals GIS,,615

With written home exercise programs being the commonly prescribed form of rehabilitation after discharge, mobile health technology coupled with task-oriented programs can enhance self-management of upper extremity training. In the current study, a rehabilitation system, namely mRehab, was designed that included a smartphone app and 3D-printed household items such as mug, bowl, key, and doorknob embedded with a smartphone. The app interface allowed the user to select rehabilitation activities and receive feedback on the number of activity repetitions completed, time to complete each activity, and quality of movement. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the usability, perceived usefulness, and acceptance of the mRehab system by individuals with stroke and identify the challenges experienced by them when using the system remotely in a home-based setting. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was used with 11 individuals with chronic stroke. Following training, individuals with stroke used the mRehab system for 6 weeks at home. Each participant completed surveys and engaged in a semistructured interview. Participants' qualitative reports regarding the usability of mRehab were integrated with their survey reports and quantitative performance data. RESULTS: Of the 11 participants, 10 rated the mRehab system between the 67.5th and 97.5th percentile on the System Usability Scale, indicating their satisfaction with the usability of the system. Participants also provided high ratings of perceived usefulness (mean 5.8, SD 0.9) and perceived ease of use (mean 5.3, SD 1.5) on a 7-point scale based on the Technology Acceptance Model. Common themes reported by participants showed a positive response to mRehab with some suggestions for improvements. Participants reported an interest in activities they perceived to be adequately challenging. Some participants indicated a need for customizing the feedback to be more interpretable. Overall, most participants indicated that they would like to continue using the mRehab system at home. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing usability in the lived environment over a prolonged duration of time is essential to identify the match between the system and users' needs and preferences. While mRehab was well accepted, further customization is desired for a better fit with the end users.

313493,Teaching Covid-19's Impact on Businesses,2021,"We report a confocal interferometric mid-infrared photothermal (MIP) microscope and its application to label-free detection of biological nanoparticles down to single virus level. We apply the interferometric scattering principle to detect the weak photothermal effect induced by infrared absorption in a viral particle. We validated this method with two kinds of viruses, namely the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and poxvirus. The single virus spectra generated by MIP microscopy show high consistency in the same group, with dominant peaks contributed by the amide I and amide II vibrations. The ratio of these two peaks are significantly different between VSV and poxvirus, highlighting the potential of using MIP microscopy for label-free differentiation of viral particles. This all-optical chemical imaging method opens a new way for spectroscopic detection of biological nanoparticles in a label-free manner and may facilitate in predicting and controlling outbreaks of emerging virus strains.","Zhang, Yi; Devaux, Alexander J.; Connor, John H.; Cheng, Ji-Xin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09940v1.pdf,615

315577,"Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Retinal Toxicity, and COVID-19",2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although COVID-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system, recent studies have reported the occurrence of neurological disorders such as stroke in relation to COVID-19 infection. Encephalitis is an inflammatory condition of the brain that has been described as a severe neurological complication of COVID-19. Despite a growing number of reported cases, encephalitis related to COVID-19 infection has not been adequately characterised. To address this gap, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to describe the incidence, clinical course, and outcomes of patients who suffer from encephalitis as a complication of COVID-19. METHODS: All studies published between 1 November 2019 and 24 October 2020 that reported on patients who developed encephalitis as a complication of COVID-19 were included. Only cases with radiological and/or biochemical evidence of encephalitis were included. RESULTS: In this study, 610 studies were screened and 23 studies reporting findings from 129,008 patients, including 138 with encephalitis, were included. The average time from diagnosis of COVID-19 to onset of encephalitis was 14.5 days (range = 10.8-18.2 days). The average incidence of encephalitis as a complication of COVID-19 was 0.215% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.056%-0.441%). The average mortality rate of encephalitis in COVID-19 patients was 13.4% (95% CI = 3.8%-25.9%). These patients also had deranged clinical parameters, including raised serum inflammatory markers and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although encephalitis is an uncommon complication of COVID-19, when present, it results in significant morbidity and mortality. Severely ill COVID-19 patients are at higher risk of suffering from encephalitis as a complication of the infection.","Siow, Isabel; Lee, Keng Siang; Zhang, John J Y; Saffari, Seyed Ehsan; Ng, Adeline",Eur. j. neurol,,615

On March 14, 2020, the surgeon general of the United States called for a stop to elective procedures. Ultimately, that led us at Scripps Health to close some clinics to protect personal protective equipment supplies and then furlough staff because of the decrease in patient visits. It soon became evident, however, that patients needed our care more than ever, and we had to pivot to provide the services they needed-but in a very different way. Our team rose to the challenge and quickly redesigned the entire organizational approach to accelerate telehealth services for the convenience of our patients. In the process, we also targeted a patient outreach program to our high-risk patients, which turned out to be an important aspect of our COVID-19 patient care initiative.","Sharieff, Ghazala Q",Front Health Serv Manage,,615

Aim: The aim of this study to evaluate the knowledge regarding common symptoms, anosmia, treatment options, and PPE among medical students in three different universities of Saudi Arabia. Methods: This cross-sectional survey conducted among medical students in Saudi Arabia. Google Forms was used to create the survey. The questionnaire included demographic information, knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, sources of information, and the level of awareness of specific symptoms (loss of smell and taste). Results: A total of 494 students completed the questionnaire. The majority of the participants were aware of common COVID-19 symptoms like fever and cough (79.8 and 67.2%, respectively), but less than half were aware that smell or taste dysfunction might be a symptom of COVID-19 (44.3 and 30.2%, respectively). The present study revealed that the source of information also plays a critical role in medical students' awareness regarding the symptoms of COVID-19. Students using international organization's websites, medical databases, or published research had better knowledge of anosmia as a COVID-19 symptom compared to those who used WhatsApp, Google, or unofficial social media pages. In our study, a minority (11.9%) of the participants relied on unofficial social media pages as the main source of their information.

321667,Illness caused by COVID-19,2021,"PurposeThis article examines the potential of increasing commitment of medical knowledge-workers (medical-KWs) in hospitals, particularly in handling deadly pandemics like COVID-19, through servant leadership behaviour. The authors hold that medical-KWs like doctors and nurses form the core team of knowledge-workers (KWs) at the forefront of fighting COVID-19 through seeking possible vaccines, treating patients and promoting behaviours that curtail its spread. Thus research directed towards enhancing their continued commitment is both timely and valuable.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses an explanatory cross-sectional survey design.FindingsResults reveal that servant leadership behaviour significantly explains changes in commitment of medical-KWs. Results further establish that perceived fairness – a key psychological factor – significantly explains how servant leadership enhances the commitment of medical-KWs.Research limitations/implicationsData used were sourced from medical-KWs in selected public hospitals only.

People bereaved by suicide are a vulnerable group who are at considerable risk of developing mental and physical health problems, such as complicated grief, post-traumatic stress disorder or cardiovascular disease. Many unanswered questions remain, in particular, in terms of their use of healthcare services. This protocol describes how we aim to systematically scope the existing literature on the professional follow-up and health service use by families bereaved by suicide. The scoping review will help to identify research gaps in the literature and aid in the planning and commission of future research. We will provide a summary of research findings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use the scoping review framework provided by the Joanna Briggs Institute. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews will be used as a guide for reporting our results. We plan to conduct an extensive literature search using relevant health-related databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL) and Web of Science. Two independent reviewers will screen the articles in a two-stage process: (1) titles and abstracts and (2) full-text documents. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This scoping review will identify and consider only previously published research. Hence, no ethical approval is considered necessary. We will disseminate the results in a scientific journal and at conferences, as well as through user organisations for people bereaved by suicide and social media.","Petersen, Sindre Hoff; Kalseth, Jorid; Kaspersen, Silje L",BMJ Open,,615

The existing temporal logic inference methods mostly neglect uncertainties in the data, which results in limited applicability of such methods in real-world deployments. In this paper, we first investigate the uncertainties associated with trajectories of a system and represent such uncertainties in the form of interval trajectories. We then propose two uncertainty-aware signal temporal logic (STL) inference approaches to classify the undesired behaviors and desired behaviors of a system. Instead of classifying finitely many trajectories, we classify infinitely many trajectories within the interval trajectories. In the first approach, we incorporate robust semantics of STL formulas with respect to an interval trajectory to quantify the margin at which an STL formula is satisfied or violated by the interval trajectory. The second approach relies on the first learning algorithm and exploits the decision tree to infer STL formulas to classify behaviors of a given system. The proposed approaches also work for non-separable data by optimizing the worst-case robustness in inferring an STL formula. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in two case studies, where the proposed algorithms show reductions in the computation time by up to four orders of magnitude in comparison with the sampling-based baseline algorithms (for a dataset with 800 sampled trajectories in total).","Baharisangari, Nasim; Gaglione, Jean-Raphael; Neider, Daniel; Topcu, Ufuk; Xu, Zhe",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11545v2.pdf,615

332083,Globalisation and social work education in the Republic of Ireland: Towards informed transnational social work for transnational problems such as COVID-19,2020,"Scalable memories that can match the speeds of superconducting logic circuits have long been desired to enable a superconducting computer. A superconducting loop that includes a Josephson junction can store a flux quantum state in picoseconds. However, the requirement for the loop inductance to create a bi-state hysteresis sets a limit on the minimal area occupied by a single memory cell. Here, we present a miniaturized superconducting memory cell based on a Three-Dimensional (3D) Nb nano-Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (nano-SQUID). The major cell area here fits within an 8*9 {\mu}m^2 rectangle with a cross-selected function for memory implementation. The cell shows periodic tunable hysteresis between two neighbouring flux quantum states produced by bias current sweeping because of the large modulation depth of the 3D nano-SQUID (~66%). Furthermore, the measured Current-Phase Relations (CPRs) of nano-SQUIDs are shown to be skewed from a sine function, as predicted by theoretical modelling. The skewness and the critical current of 3D nano-SQUIDs are linearly correlated. It is also found that the hysteresis loop size is in a linear scaling relationship with the CPR skewness using the statistics from characterisation of 26 devices. We show that the CPR skewness range of {\pi}/4~3{\pi}/4 is equivalent to a large loop inductance in creating a stable bi-state hysteresis for memory implementation. Therefore, the skewed CPR of 3D nano-SQUID enables further superconducting memory cell miniaturization by overcoming the inductance limitation of the loop area.","Chen, Lei; Wu, Lili; Wang, Yue; Pan, Yinping; Zhang, Denghui; Zeng, Junwen; Liu, Xiaoyu; Ma, Linxian; Peng, Wei; Wang, Yihua; Ren, Jie; Wang, Zhen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11734v1.pdf,615

Design and Methods: Therefore, we conducted an online questionnaire-based survey for the Indian population after 37 days of complete lockdown to assess the integrative effects of such home restriction and social isolation on mid-sleep time, social jetlag, and their associated psychosocial behavior. From the reports of sleep onset and waking-up times before and during lockdown as obtained from a total of 1511 respondents of &#8805;18 years, midsleep time (MST) and social jetlag (SJL) were calculated. Participants also rated their psychosocial behavior related variables on a Likert scale. Results: Significantly delayed MST was noted during the lockdown. The majority showed reduced social jetlag; however, younger people and female subjects exhibited more SJL with delay in MST. Also, delayed MST and elevated SJL problems were more clearly demonstrated in people exhibiting more disturbances in sleep quality and daily routine, lower general mood status, irregular feeding habits (snacking frequency), worsened personal relationship, quality of life, and increased daydreaming events. Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of maintaining a regular daily routine with respect to sleep-wake patterns and eating habits to minimize the impact of such a crisis situation on sleep behavior, social jetlag, and associated psychosocial wellbeing.","Sinha, Meenakshi; Pande, Babita; Sinha, Ramanjan",J Public Health Res,,615

Upon infection, SARS-CoV-2 attaches to its receptor, that is, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), on the surface of host cells and is then internalized into host cells via enzymatic machineries. This subsequently stimulates immune response factors. Since the host immune response and severity of COVID-19 vary among individuals, genetic risk factors for severe COVID-19 cases have been investigated. Our research group recently conducted a survey of genetic variants among SARS-CoV-2-interacting molecules across populations, noting near absence of difference in allele frequency spectrum between populations in these genes. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified genetic risk factors for severe COVID-19 cases in a segment of chromosome 3 that involves six genes encoding three immune-regulatory chemokine receptors and another three molecules. The risk haplotype seemed to be inherited from Neanderthals, suggesting genetic adaptation against pathogens in modern human evolution. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 uses highly conserved molecules as its virion interaction, whereas its immune response appears to be genetically biased in individuals to some extent. We herein review the molecular process of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as our further survey of genetic variants of its related immune effectors. We also discuss aspects of modern human evolution.","Lee, Ji-Won; Lee, In-Hee; Sato, Takanori; Kong, Sek Won; Iimura, Tadahiro",Dev. growth differ,,615

The testis and prostate produce semen. At present, there are contradictory reports about whether SARS-CoV-2 can exist in the semen of infected men. Objective: To provide a comprehensive overview of the topic of whether COVID-19 can impact on male reproductive system. Methods: We reviewed the relevant publications on the possible impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on male reproductive system and summarized the latest and most important research results so far. Literature published in English from December 2019 to January 31, 2021 regarding the existence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen, testis, and prostatic fluid and the effects of COVID-19 on male reproductive were included. Results: We identified 28 related studies, only one of which reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen. The study found that the semen quality of patients with moderate infection was lower than that of patients with mild infection and healthy controls. The impaired semen quality may be related to fever and inflammation. Pathological analysis of the testis/epididymis showed that SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were positive in 10 testicular samples, and the spermatogenic function of the testis was impaired. All 94 expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Conclusion: The likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 in the semen of COVID-19 patients is very small, and semen should rarely be regarded as a carrier of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material. However, COVID-19 may cause testicular spermatogenic dysfunction via immune or inflammatory reactions. Long-term follow-up is needed for COVID-19 male patients and fetuses conceived during the father's infection period.","He, Yanfei; Wang, Jie; Ren, Junlin; Zhao, Yubo; Chen, Jing; Chen, Xuejiao",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,615

This paper introduces a new enhancement to ultraviolet (UV) air purifiers in air ventilation systems, which delivers a higher inactivation UV dose, eliminating the need for either higher exposure time or a stronger UV source. The modified transfer matrix method in the cylindrical geometry represents the main tool of our theoretical considerations. The new enhancement utilizes an annular photonic crystal (APC) for reflecting UV radiation 99%. The numerical simulation shows that the structure is stable over a wide range of operating scales that fit the extensive range of air purifiers, working at different scales. Additionally, the possibility of using APC over a wide range of UV sources is investigated. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Ameen, A. A.; Elsayed, H.; Aly, A. H.",RSC Advances,,615

The drying of the droplet is predicted by diffusion-limited evaporation model for a sessile droplet placed on a partially-wetted surface with a pinned contact line. The variation of droplet volume, contact angle, ambient temperature, and humidity are considered. We analyze the chances of the survival of the viruses present in the droplet, based on the lifetime of the droplets in several conditions, and find that the chances of survival of the virus are strongly affected by each of these parameters. The magnitude of shear stress inside the droplet computed using the model is not large enough to obliterate the virus. We also explore the relationship between the drying time of a droplet and the growth rate of the spread of COVID-19 for five different cities, and find that they are weakly correlated.","Bhardwaj, Rajneesh; Agrawal, Amit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10897v1.pdf,615

347370,Pandemic Futures and Nuclear Weapon Risks: The Nagasaki 75th Anniversary pandemic-nuclear nexus scenarios final report,2021,"Background: The VOYAGER PAD trial demonstrated superiority of rivaroxaban plus aspirin versus aspirin to reduce major cardiac and ischemic limb events following lower extremity revascularization (LER). Clopidogrel is commonly used as a short-term adjunct to aspirin after endovascular revascularization, whether clopidogrel modifies the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban has not been described. Methods: VOYAGER PAD was a phase 3, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in symptomatic PAD patients undergoing LER randomized to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus 100 mg aspirin daily or rivaroxaban placebo plus aspirin. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of acute limb ischemia, major amputation of a vascular cause, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke or cardiovascular death. The principal safety endpoint was TIMI major bleeding with ISTH major bleeding a secondary safety outcome. Clopidogrel use was allowed at the discretion of the investigator for up to six months following the qualifying revascularization. Results: 3313 (50.6%) of the randomized patients received clopidogrel, median duration of 29.0 days. Over 3-years the hazard ratio (HR) for the primary outcome of rivaroxaban versus placebo was 0.85 (95% CI 0.71-1.01) with clopidogrel and 0.86 (95% CI 0.73-1.01) without, without statistical heterogeneity (p-interaction =0.92). Rivaroxaban resulted in an early apparent reduction in acute limb ischemia (ALI) within 30 days, HR 0.45 (95%CI 0.14-1.46) with and HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.22-1.01) without clopidogrel (p-interaction = 0.93). Compared with aspirin, rivaroxaban increased TIMI major bleeding similarly regardless of clopidogrel use (p-interaction 0.71). With clopidogrel use >30 days, rivaroxaban was associated with more ISTH major bleeding within 365 days (HR 3.20, 95% CI 1.44-7.13) compared with shorter durations of clopidogrel (p-trend 0.06). Conclusions: In the VOYAGER PAD trial, rivaroxaban plus aspirin reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular and limb events with an early benefit for ALI regardless of clopidogrel use. The safety of rivaroxaban was consistent regardless of clopidogrel use, but with a trend for more ISTH major bleeding with clopidogrel use > 30 days than a shorter duration. These data support the addition of rivaroxaban to aspirin after LER regardless of concomitant clopidogrel with a short (course &#8804; 30 days) associated with less bleeding.

348053,Socioeconomic vulnerability in the face of covid-19 in municipalities of ceará,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of in-hospital cardiac arrest in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and to describe the characteristics and outcomes for patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest within the ICU, compared with non-ICU patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Finally, we evaluated outcomes stratified by age. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, and preprint websites was conducted between January 1, 2020, and December 10, 2020. Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews identification: CRD42020203369. STUDY SELECTION: Studies reporting on consecutive in-hospital cardiac arrest with a resuscitation attempt among patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently performed study selection and data extraction. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were synthesized according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or through an independent third reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eight studies reporting on 847 in-hospital cardiac arrest were included. In-hospital cardiac arrest incidence varied between 1.5% and 5.8% among hospitalized patients and 8.0-11.4% among patients in ICU. In-hospital cardiac arrest occurred more commonly in older male patients. Most initial rhythms were nonshockable (83.9%, [asystole = 36.4% and pulseless electrical activity = 47.6%]). Return of spontaneous circulation occurred in 33.3%, with a 91.7% in-hospital mortality. In-hospital cardiac arrest events in ICU had higher incidence of return of spontaneous circulation (36.6% vs 18.7%; p < 0.001) and relatively lower mortality (88.7% vs 98.1%; p < 0.001) compared with in-hospital cardiac arrest in non-ICU locations. Patients greater than or equal to 60 years old had significantly higher in-hospital mortality than those less than 60 years (93.1% vs 87.9%; p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately, one in 20 patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 received resuscitation for an in-hospital cardiac arrest. Hospital survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest within the ICU was higher than non-ICU locations and seems comparable with prepandemic survival for nonshockable rhythms. Although the data provide guidance surrounding prognosis after in-hospital cardiac arrest, it should be interpreted cautiously given the paucity of information surrounding treatment limitations and resource constraints during the pandemic. Further research is into actual causative mechanisms is needed.","Lim, Zheng Jie; Ponnapa Reddy, Mallikarjuna; Curtis, J Randall; Afroz, Afsana; Billah, Baki; Sheth, Vishad; Hayek, Salim S; Leaf, David E; Miles, Jeremy A; Shah, Priyank; Yuriditsky, Eugene; Jones, Daryl; Shekar, Kiran; Subramaniam, Ashwin",Crit Care Med,,615
348378,Formación multinivel (atención primaria-hospital) mediante simulación con conexión en tiempo real en tiempos de COVID-19. Una herramienta a considerar./ [Simultaneous hospital/primary care real time simulation during COVID-19 alert],2020,"PURPOSE: COVID-19 has infected millions of people worldwide. One of the most important hurdles in controlling the spread of this disease is the inefficiency and lack of medical tests. Computed tomography (CT) scans are promising in providing accurate and fast detection of COVID-19. However, determining COVID-19 requires highly trained radiologists and suffers from inter-observer variability. To remedy these limitations, this paper introduces an automatic methodology based on an ensemble of deep transfer learning for the detection of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 15 pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures: EfficientNets(B0-B5), NasNetLarge, NasNetMobile, InceptionV3, ResNet-50, SeResnet 50, Xception, DenseNet121, ResNext50 and Inception_resnet_v2 are used and then fine-tuned on the target task. After that, we built an ensemble method based on majority voting of the best combination of deep transfer learning outputs to further improve the recognition performance. We have used a publicly available dataset of CT scans, which consists of 349 CT scans labeled as being positive for COVID-19 and 397 negative COVID-19 CT scans that are normal or contain other types of lung diseases. RESULTS: The experimental results indicate that the majority voting of 5 deep transfer learning architecture with EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, EfficientNetB5, Inception_resnet_v2, and Xception has the higher results than the individual transfer learning structure and among the other models based on precision (0.857), recall (0.854) and accuracy (0.85) metrics in diagnosing COVID-19 from CT scans. CONCLUSION: Our study based on an ensemble deep transfer learning system with different pre-trained CNNs architectures can work well on a publicly available dataset of CT images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on CT scans.","Gifani, Parisa; Shalbaf, Ahmad; Vafaeezadeh, Majid",Int. j. comput. assist. radiol. surg.

METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional study using piloted structured questionnaires with self-reported responses from Indian orthopaedic surgeons. Study participants were identified through social networking sites: Facebook and WhatsApp. The extent of anxiety and sleep quality was assessed by the standardised seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, single-item sleep quality scale, questions on unavailability of personal protective equipment, training module on COVID-19 and change in orthopaedic patient management. RESULTS: One hundred male orthopaedic surgeons responded to the survey with majority (79%) in 30-44 years age group. Severe anxiety scores were observed in 8%; moderate, mild and minimal anxiety was observed in 12%, 27% and 53% surgeons respectively. Changes in management practice due to the pandemic was admitted by 65% respondents. We also observed an association between higher anxiety among surgeons and primary or secondary level of healthcare facility: (p = 0.04). Sleep disturbance was significantly associated with change in management practice to non-operative procedures (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Anxiety among orthopaedic surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic is related to factors like younger age group, working in a primary or secondary healthcare facility. Early recognition of anxiety is essential to prevent serious psychological sequelae.","Sharma, Vyom; Kumar, Narinder; Gupta, Bhawna; Mahajan, Akanksha",J Orthop Surg (Hong Kong),,615

The impacts of lockdown policies on joint surgeries are unknown. Therefore, we assessed the effects of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions on the number of emergency and elective hip joint surgeries, and explored whether these procedures are more/less affected by lockdown restrictions than other hospital care.Patients and methods - In 1,344,355 persons aged &#8805; 35 years in the Norwegian emergency preparedness (BEREDT C19) register, we studied the daily number of persons having (1) emergency surgeries due to hip fractures, and (2) electively planned surgeries due to hip osteoarthritis before and after COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were implemented nationally on March 13, 2020, for different age and sex groups. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) reflect the after-lockdown number of surgeries divided by the before-lockdown number of surgeries.Results - After-lockdown elective hip surgeries comprised one-third the number of before-lockdown (IRR â¼0.3), which is a greater drop than that seen in all-cause elective hospital care (IRR â¼0.6). Men aged 35-69 had half the number of emergency hip fracture surgeries (IRR â¼0.6), whereas women aged &#8805; 70 had the same number of emergency hip fracture surgeries after lockdown (IRR â¼1). Only women aged 35-69 and men aged &#8805; 70 had emergency hip fracture surgery rates after lockdown comparable to what may be expected based on analyses of all-cause acute care (IRR â¼0.80)Interpretation - It is important to note for future pandemics management that lockdown restrictions may impact more on scheduled joint surgery than other scheduled hospital care. Lockdown may also impact the number of emergency joint surgeries for men aged &#8805; 35 but not those for women aged &#8805; 70.","Magnusson, Karin; Helgeland, Jon; Grøsland, Mari; Telle, Kjetil",Acta Orthop,,615

Dexamethasone is an immunosuppressive treatment potentially increasing the risk of secondary hospital acquired infections in critically ill patients. We conducted an observational retrospective study in three French intensive care units (ICUs) comparing the first and second waves of pandemic to investigate the role of dexamethasone in the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and blood stream infections (BSI). Patients admitted from March to November 2020 with a documented COVID-19 and requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) for &#8805; 48 h were included. The main study outcomes were the incidence of VAP and BSI according to the use of dexamethasone. Secondary outcomes were the ventilator-free days (VFD) at day-28 and day-60, ICU and hospital length of stay and mortality. RESULTS: Among the 151 patients included, 84 received dexamethasone, all but one during the second wave. VAP occurred in 63% of patients treated with dexamethasone (DEXA+) and 57% in those not receiving dexamethasone (DEXA-) (p = 0.43). The cumulative incidence of VAP, considering death, duration of MV and late immunosuppression as competing factors was not different between groups (p = 0.59). A multivariate analysis did not identify dexamethasone as an independent risk factor for VAP occurrence. The occurrence of BSI was not different between groups (29 vs. 30%; p = 0.86). DEXA+ patients had more VFD at day-28 (9 (0-21) vs. 0 (0-11) days; p = 0.009) and a reduced ICU length of stay (20 (11-44) vs. 32 (17-46) days; p = 0.01). Mortality did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of COVID-19 patients requiring invasive MV, dexamethasone was not associated with an increased incidence of VAP or BSI. Dexamethasone might not explain the high rates of VAP and BSI observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Gragueb-Chatti, Ines; Lopez, Alexandre; Hamidi, Dany; Guervilly, Christophe; Loundou, Anderson; Daviet, Florence; Cassir, Nadim; Papazian, Laurent; Forel, Jean-Marie; Leone, Marc; Dellamonica, Jean; Hraiech, Sami",Ann Intensive Care,,615

358006,Young people in oncological treatment during COVID-19: indicators of the social representation of the coronavírus/ Jovens em tratamento oncológico durante o COVID-19: indicadores da representação social do coronavírus,2021,"Purpose This paper aims to detect the opportunities and problems when teaching with cases since the COVID-19 pivot to online. Design/methodology/approach From a qualitative phenomenological approach, both authors reflect on the pivot to online case method teaching in their master's level courses in Colombia and the Dominican Republic. Findings The reflection allowed the authors to validate that the questions before and during the debate and the voting are resources equally valuable for discussing cases in the traditional classroom and online. However, the authors observe a pivot to teaching with cases online from the COVID-19 pandemic in aspects such as teamwork requiring more time in online class due to internet problems or students' slowing down. The instructor's viewing of teamwork is intermittent and causes feeling out of control. Working with cameras on or off generates different results in the students, in the teaching-learning process and in the results, which require the instructor's good judgement decisions. The online discussion planning and organisation demand flexibility and empathy by the instructor, to promote a more significant student-student interaction, which, in the experience, is limited in the virtual environment. Finally, working with cases online generates and requires additional skills in the instructors to those of the traditional classroom. Originality/value The study's originality consists of identifying the main divergences between face-to-face and online teaching with the case method, from the COVID-19 pivot to online. The study's value is to warn instructors of problems that may arise in online teaching with the case method, for which recommendations are made.","Garcia, L. D. G.; Cabanas, M.

Our objective with this national survey was to determine how the pandemic and mitigation efforts affected the physical and emotional well-being of parents and children in the United States through early June 2020. METHODS: In June 2020, we conducted a national survey of parents with children age <18 to measure changes in health status, insurance status, food security, use of public food assistance resources, child care, and use of health care services since the pandemic began. RESULTS: Since March 2020, 27% of parents reported worsening mental health for themselves, and 14% reported worsening behavioral health for their children. The proportion of families with moderate or severe food insecurity increased from 6% before March 2020 to 8% after, employer-sponsored insurance coverage of children decreased from 63% to 60%, and 24% of parents reported a loss of regular child care. Worsening mental health for parents occurred alongside worsening behavioral health for children in nearly 1 in 10 families, among whom 48% reported loss of regular child care, 16% reported change in insurance status, and 11% reported worsening food security. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease pandemic has had a substantial tandem impact on parents and children in the United States. As policy makers consider additional measures to mitigate the health and economic effects of the pandemic, they should consider the unique needs of families with children.","Patrick, Stephen W; Henkhaus, Laura E; Zickafoose, Joseph S; Lovell, Kim; Halvorson, Alese; Loch, Sarah; Letterie, Mia; Davis, Matthew M",Pediatrics,,615

358592,How accurate is our picture of the pandemic?: CMAJ CMAJ,2020,"BACKGROUND: Infectious disease predictions models, including virtually all epidemiological models describing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, are rarely evaluated empirically. The aim of the present study was to investigate the predictive accuracy of a prognostic model for forecasting the development of the cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in countries and administrative regions worldwide until the end of May 2020. METHODS: The cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases was forecasted in 251 regions with a horizon of two weeks, one month, and two months using a hierarchical logistic model at the end of March 2020. Forecasts were compared to actual observations by using a series of evaluation metrics. RESULTS: On average, predictive accuracy was very high in nearly all regions at the two weeks forecast, high in most regions at the one month forecast, and notable in the majority of the regions at the two months forecast. Higher accuracy was associated with the availability of more data for estimation and with a more pronounced cumulative case growth from the first case to the date of estimation. In some strongly affected regions, cumulative case counts were considerably underestimated. CONCLUSIONS: With keeping its limitations in mind, the investigated model may be used for the preparation and distribution of resources during the initial phase of epidemics. Future research should primarily address the model's assumptions and its scope of applicability. In addition, establishing a relationship with known mechanisms and traditional epidemiological models of disease transmission would be desirable.","Kriston, Levente",BMC Med Res Methodol,,615

Observations of working stocks of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that sequential propagation in Vero cells leads to critical changes in the region of the furin cleavage site, which significantly reduce the value of the working stock for critical research studies. Serially propagating SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells leads to rapid increases in genetic variants while propagation in other cell lines (e.g. Vero/hSLAM) appears to mitigate this risk thereby improving the overall genetic stability of working stocks. From these observations, investigators are urged to monitor genetic variants carefully when propagating SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells.","Funnell, S. G. P.; Afrough, B.; Baczenas, J.

361534,Telemedicine and COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: the ability to implement effective preventive and control measures is rooted in public health surveillance to promptly identify and isolate contagious patients. OBJECTIVES: to describe some organizational aspects and resources involved in the control of COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: observational cross sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: a survey of methods and tools adopted by the competent service (Prevention department) in the Local public health units (LHU) of the regional Health services has been performed in May 2020. The survey collected data related to activities carried out during the month of April 2020 on the surveillance system for collection of suspected cases, their virological ascertainment, the isolation procedures and contact-tracing activities by means of an online questionnaire filled in by the public health structure of the regional health system. A convenience sample of Prevention departments was recruited. RESULTS: in 44 Prevention departments of 14 Regions/Autonomous Provinces (caring for 40% of the population residing in Italy), different services were swiftly engaged in pandemic response. Reports of suspected cases were about 3 times the number of confirmed cases in the same month. Local reporting form was used in 46% of the LHUs while a regional form was available in 42% of the Departments (in 9/14 Regions). In one fourth the forms were not always used and 2% had no forms for the reporting of suspected cases. Data were recorded in 52% of LHUs on local databases, while in 20% a regional database (in 7 Regions) had been created. A proportion of 11% did not record the data for further elaboration. The virological assessment with nasopharyngeal swabs out of the hospital setting was carried out on the average in 7 points in each LHU (median 5) and the average daily capacity was 350 (71 per 100,000) swabs. The rate of subjects newly tested during the month of April was of 893 per 100,000 new people. Data collected at the swabbing were recorded on a regional platform in 17 LHUs (39%) of 8 Regions. In 7% LHUs only positive specimens were recorded electronically. Local files were used in 27% LHUs. The interview with confirmed cases was carried out with a local questionnaire in 52% LHUs, while 14% stated that a standardized form was not used. The data collected about cases were recorded on a regional IT platform in 30% Departments (in 8 Regions) and in 41% data were registered only locally. For each confirmed case in April, a median of 4 contacts were identified. Only 13 (30%) Departments in 9 Regions have registered contact data on a regional database. Ten Departments (23%) have only hard copies, while 56% recorded data on local databases. About 5 health professionals for 100,000 resident population were involved in each LHU in each of the following activities as receiving reports of suspected cases, swabs collection, interviews of cases and contact identifications. CONCLUSIONS: the pandemic required rapidly a great organizational effort and great flexibility to increase response capacity, which now must be strengthened and maintained. Several different tools (forms and electronic files) have been developed in each LHU and used for the same surveillance operational processes with a loss in local efficiency. The inhomogeneous data collection and recording is an obstacle for further analyses and risk identifications and is a missed opportunity for the advancement of our knowledge on pandemic epidemiology analysis. In Italy, updating the pandemic response plans is the priority, at national, regional and local level, and the occasion to fill the gaps and to improve surveillance systems to the interruption of COVID-19 transmission.","Salmaso, Stefania; Zambri, Francesca; Renzi, Matteo; Giusti, Angela",Epidemiol Prev,,615

369796,Anthropological and social nursing representations in the covid-19 context,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A national lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Turkey was introduced in March 2020. We think that lockdowns may lead to weight gain and worsening of glycemic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The purpose of this study was to investigate how type 2 DM patients were affected by the lockdown. METHOD: Type 2 DM patients unable to attend regular follow-ups due to lockdown over a 75-day period between March and June 2020 and who again attended polyclinic follow-up when the lockdown was lifted were included in the study. These patients' glycemic control and weight status were compared with the pre-lockdown period. In addition, patients' general habits, and adherence to diet and exercise were evaluated, while their general health was assessed using the Short-Form 36-item survey. RESULT: The research involved 101 type 2 DM patients, 57 men (56.5%) and 44 women (44.5%), with a mean age of 55 ± 13. Patients' mean pre-lockdown weight was 84.7 ± 16.4 kg, rising to 85.5 ± 16.8 kg post-lockdown, although the increase was not statistically significant (p = 0.781). In terms of glycemic parameters, Hba1c rose from 7.67 ± 1.76 to 8.11 ± 2.48, and fasting glucose from 157.9 (83-645) mg/dl to 163.2 (84-550) mg/dl, none of which were statistically significant (p = 0.253, p = 0.079, respectively). CONCLUSION: In addition to weight gain among type 2 DM patients during the Covid 19 lockdown, statistically insignificant increases were also observed in such glycemic parameters. This was a small sample and further studies with larger sample are needed.","Önmez, Attila; Gamsizkan, Zerrin; Özdemir, Seyma; Kesikbas, Enis; Gökosmanoglu, Feyzi; Torun, Serkan; Cinemre, Hakan",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,615

Influenza infection disturbs the cross-talk connection between lung and gut. Probiotic treatment can inhibit influenza virus infection;however, the mechanism remains to be explored. The mice received Lactobacillus mucosae 1025, Bifidobacterium breve CCFM1026, and their mixture MIX for 19 days. Effects of probiotics on clinical symptoms, immune responses, and gut microbial alteration were evaluated. L. mucosae 1025 and MIX significantly reduced the loss of body weight, pathological symptoms, and viral loading. B. breve CCFM1026 significantly reduced the proportion of neutrophils and increased lymphocytes, the expressions of TLR7, MyD88, TRAF6, and TNF-α to restore the immune disorders. MIX increased the antiviral protein MxA expression, the relative abundances of Lactobacillus, Mucispirillum, Adlercreutzia, Bifidobacterium, and further regulated SCFA metabolism resulting in an enhancement of butyrate. The correlation analysis revealed that the butyrate was positively related to MxA expression (p &lt; 0.001) but was negatively related to viral loading (p &lt; 0.05). The results implied the possible antiviral mechanisms that MIX decreased viral loading and increased the antiviral protein MxA expression, which was closely associated with the increased butyrate production resulting from gut microbial alteration.","Lu, Wenwei Fang Zhifeng Liu Xinyang Li Lingzhi Zhang Pinghu Zhao Jianxin Zhang Hao Chen Wei",Foods,,615

Two nose sprays showed virucidal activity but were cytotoxic precluding further analysis in cell culture. One nasal and one mouth spray suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection of TMPRSS2-Vero E6 cells and primary differentiated human airway epithelial cultures. The antiviral activity in both sprays could be attributed to polyanionic Î¹- and &#954;-carrageenans. Thus, application of carrageenan containing nasal and mouth sprays may reduce the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and may limit viral spread, warranting further clinical evaluation.","Schütz, Desiree; Conzelmann, Carina; Fois, Giorgio; Groß, Rüdiger; Weil, Tatjana; Wettstein, Lukas; Stenger, Steffen; Zelikin, Alexander; Hoffmann, Thomas K; Frick, Manfred; Müller, Janis A; Münch, Jan","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",,615

Hence, the current study was designed to unravel the protein make-up of human kidney stones and its impact on renal cells' altered proteome, induced as the consequence of CaOx injury. CaOx kidney stones were collected from patients; stones were pooled for entire cohort, followed by protein extraction. Immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and flow-cytometric analysis revealed the promising antilithiatic activity of kidney stone matrix proteins. The iTRAQ analysis of renal cells showed up-regulation of 12 proteins and down-regulation of 41 proteins due to CaOx insult, however, this differential expression was normalized in the presence of kidney stone matrix proteins. Protein network analysis revealed involvement of up-regulated proteins in apoptosis, calcium-binding, inflammatory and stress response pathways. Moreover, seven novel antilithiatic proteins were identified from human kidney stones' matrix: Tenascin-X-isoform2, CCDC-144A, LIM domain kinase-1, Serine/Arginine receptor matrix protein-2, mitochondrial peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase, volume-regulated anion channel subunit-LRRC8A and BMPR2. In silico analysis concluded that these proteins exert antilithiatic potential through crystal binding, thereby inhibiting the crystal-cell interaction, a pre-requisite to initiate inflammatory response. Thus, the outcomes of this study provide insights into the molecular events of CaOx induced renal toxicity and subsequent progression into nephrolithiasis.","Narula, Shifa; Tandon, Simran; Kumar, Dhruv; Varshney, Swati; Adlakha, Khushboo; Sengupta, Shantanu; Singh, Shrawan Kumar; Tandon, Chanderdeep",Life Sci,,615

372241,"Pregnancy, breastfeeding and the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine: an ethics-based framework for shared decision-making: CMAJ",2021,"Neonatal brain injury or neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is a significant morbidity and mortality factor in preterm and full-term newborns. NE has an incidence in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 per 1000 live births carrying a considerable burden for neurological outcomes such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, cognitive impairments, and hydrocephaly. Many scoring systems based on different risk factor combinations in regression models have been proposed to predict abnormal outcomes. Birthweight, gestational age, Apgar scores, pH, ultrasound and MRI biomarkers, seizures onset, EEG pattern, and seizure duration were the most referred predictors in the literature. Our study proposes a decision-tree approach based on clinical risk factors for abnormal outcomes in newborns with the neurological syndrome to assist in neonatal encephalopathy prognosis as a complementary tool to the acknowledged scoring systems. We retrospectively studied 188 newborns with associated encephalopathy and seizures in the perinatal period. Etiology and abnormal outcomes were assessed through correlations with the risk factors. We computed mean, median, odds ratios values for birth weight, gestational age, 1-min Apgar Score, 5-min Apgar score, seizures onset, and seizures duration monitoring, applying standard statistical methods first. Subsequently, CART (classification and regression trees) and cluster analysis were employed, further adjusting the medians. Out of 188 cases, 84 were associated to abnormal outcomes. The hierarchy on etiology frequencies was dominated by cerebrovascular impairments, metabolic anomalies, and infections. Both preterms and full-terms at risk were bundled in specific categories defined as high-risk 75-100%, intermediate risk 52.9%, and low risk 0-25% after CART algorithm implementation. Cluster analysis illustrated the median values, profiling at a glance the preterm model in high-risk groups and a full-term model in the inter-mediate-risk category. Our study illustrates that, in addition to standard statistics methodologies, decision-tree approaches could provide a first-step tool for the prognosis of the abnormal outcome in newborns with encephalopathy.","NeamÈu, Bogdan Mihai; Visa, Gabriela; Maniu, Ionela; Ognean, Maria Livia; Pérez-Elvira, Rubén; Dragomir, Andrei; Agudo, Maria; Èofariu, Ciprian Radu; Gheonea, Mihaela; Pitic, Antoniu; Brad, Remus; Matei, Claudiu; Teodoru, Minodora; Bacila, Ciprian",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,615

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of ED health care personnel in 20 geographically diverse university-affiliated EDs from May 13, to July 8, 2020, including case counts of prior laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnoses among all ED health care personnel, and then point-in-time serology (with confirmatory testing) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing in a sample of volunteers without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. Health care staff were categorized as clinical (physicians, advanced practice providers, and nurses) and nonclinical (clerks, social workers, and case managers). Previously undiagnosed infection was based on positive SARS-CoV-2 serology or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction result among health care personnel without prior diagnosis. RESULTS: Diagnosed COVID-19 occurred in 2.8% of health care personnel (193/6,788), and the prevalence was similar for nonclinical and clinical staff (3.8% versus 2.7%; odds ratio 1.5; 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 3.2). Among 1,606 health care personnel without previously diagnosed COVID-19, 29 (1.8%) had evidence of current or past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most (62%; 18/29) who were seropositive did not think they had been infected, 76% (19/25) recalled COVID-19-compatible symptoms, and 89% (17/19) continued to work while symptomatic. Accounting for both diagnosed and undiagnosed infections, 4.6% (95% confidence interval 2.8% to 7.5%) of ED health care personnel were estimated to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, with 38% of those infections undiagnosed. CONCLUSION: In late spring and early summer 2020, the estimated prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was 4.6%, and greater than one third of infections were undiagnosed. Undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection may pose substantial risk for transmission to other staff and patients.","Mohr, Nicholas M; Harland, Karisa K; Krishnadasan, Anusha; Eyck, Patrick Ten; Mower, William R; Willey, James; Chisolm-Straker, Makini; Lim, Stephen C; McDonald, L Clifford; Kutty, Preeta K; Hesse, Elisabeth; Santibanez, Scott; Talan, David A",Ann. emerg. med,,615

METHODS: We analysed consecutive COVID-19 patients (RT-PCR confirmed) undergoing CTPA in March 2020 for PTE clinical suspicion. Clinical data were retrieved. Two experienced radiologists reviewed CTPAs to assess pulmonary parenchyma and vascular findings. RESULTS: Among 34 patients who underwent CTPA, 26 had PTE (76%, 20 males, median age 61 years, interquartile range 54-70), 20/26 (77%) with comorbidities (mainly hypertension, 44%), and 8 (31%) subsequently dying. Eight PTE patients were under thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin, four PTE patients had lower-limbs deep vein thrombosis at ultrasound examination (performed in 33/34 patients). Bilateral PTE characterised 19/26 cases, with main branches involved in 10/26 cases. Twelve patients had a parenchymal involvement >75%, the predominant pneumonia pattern being consolidation in 10/26 patients, ground glass opacities in 9/26, crazy paving in 5/26, and both ground glass opacities and consolidation in 2/26. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients are prone to PTE. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: PTE, potentially attributable to an underlying thrombophilic status, may be more frequent than expected in COVID-19 patients.

Having the dental team as part of this strategy would increase availability of healthcare workers. They have the potential to make a significant contribution as part of the medical workforce during national and global crises.

The potential implications of these findings in athletes are significant given the concern that exercise, during the acute phase of viral myocarditis, may exacerbate myocardial injury and precipitate malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Such concerns have led to the development and publication of expert consensus documents aimed at providing guidance for the evaluation of athletes after contracting COVID-19 in order to permit safe return to play. Cardiac imaging is at the center of these evaluations. This review seeks to evaluate the current evidence regarding COVID-19-associated cardiovascular disease and how multimodality imaging may be useful in the screening and clinical evaluation of athletes with suspected cardiovascular complications of infection.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 160 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the National Center for Global Health and Medicine between January 26, 2020 and July 25, 2020. We searched PubMed for prognostic models for COVID-19. The predicted outcome was initiation of respiratory support or death. Performance of the candidate models was evaluated according to discrimination and calibration. We recalibrated the intercept of each model with our data. We also updated each model by adding ß2-microglobulin (ß2MG) to the model and recalculating the intercept and the coefficient of ß2MG. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 49.8 years, 68% were male, 88.7% were Japanese. The study outcomes occurred in 15 patients, including two deaths. Two-hundred sixty-nine papers were screened, and four candidate prognostic models were assessed. The model of Bartoletti et al. had the highest area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (0.88; 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.96). All four models overestimated the probability of occurrence of the outcome. None of the four models showed statistically significant improvement in AUCs by adding ß2MG. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the existing prediction models for COVID-19 overestimate the probability of occurrence of unfavorable outcomes in a Japanese cohort. When applying a prediction model to a different cohort, it is desirable to evaluate its performance according to the prevalent health situation in that region.","Yamada, Gen; Hayakawa, Kayoko; Asai, Yusuke; Matsunaga, Nobuaki; Ohtsu, Hiroshi; Hojo, Masayuki; Hashimoto, Masao; Kobayashi, Kentaro; Sasaki, Ryo; Okamoto, Tatsuya; Yanagawa, Yasuaki; Katagiri, Daisuke; Terada, Mari; Suzuki, Michiyo; Sato, Lubna; Miyazato, Yusuke; Ishikane, Masahiro; Morioka, Shinichiro; Saito, Sho; Ohmagari, Norio",J. infect. chemother,,615
377267,COVID-19 Infection risk posed by drinking alcohol at restaurants or bars in Japan,2021,"We study the influence of the rate of the attainment of herd immunity (HI), in the absence of an approved vaccine, on the vulnerable population. We essentially ask the question: how hard the evolution towards the desired herd immunity could be on the life of the vulnerables? We employ mathematical modelling (chemical network theory) and cellular automata based computer simulations to study the human cost of an epidemic spread and an effective strategy to introduce HI. Implementation of different strategies to counter the spread of the disease requires a certain degree of quantitative understanding of the time dependence of the outcome. In this paper, our main objective is to gather understanding of the dependence of outcome on the rate of progress of HI. We generalize the celebrated SIR model (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) by compartmentalizing the susceptible population into two categories- (i) vulnerables and (ii) resilients, and study dynamical evolution of the disease progression. We achieve such a classification by employing different rates of recovery of vulnerables vis-a-vis resilients. We obtain the relative fatality of these two sub-categories as a function of the percentages of the vulnerable and resilient population, and the complex dependence on the rate of attainment of herd immunity. Our results quantify the adverse effects on the recovery rates of vulnerables in the course of attaining the herd immunity. We find the important result that a slower attainment of the HI is relatively less fatal. However, a slower progress towards HI could be complicated by many intervening factors.","Mondal, Sayantan; Mukherjee, Saumyak; Bagchi, Biman",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14496v1.pdf,615

Tocilizumab reduced progression to mechanical ventilation and death in a trial population enriched for racial and ethnic minorities. We aimed to investigate whether tocilizumab treatment could prevent COVID-19 progression in the first multicentre randomised controlled trial of tocilizumab done entirely in a lower-middle-income country. METHODS: COVINTOC is an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial done at 12 public and private hospitals across India. Adults (aged &#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19 (Indian Ministry of Health grading) confirmed by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result were randomly assigned (1:1 block randomisation) to receive tocilizumab 6 mg/kg plus standard care (the tocilizumab group) or standard care alone (the standard care group). The primary endpoint was progression of COVID-19 (from moderate to severe or from severe to death) up to day 14 in the modified intention-to-treat population of all participants who had at least one post-baseline assessment for the primary endpoint. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients. The trial is completed and registered with the Clinical Trials Registry India (CTRI/2020/05/025369). FINDINGS: 180 patients were recruited between May 30, 2020, and Aug 31, 2020, and randomly assigned to the tocilizumab group (n=90) or the standard care group (n=90). One patient randomly assigned to the standard care group inadvertently received tocilizumab at baseline and was included in the tocilizumab group for all analyses. One patient randomly assigned to the standard care group withdrew consent after the baseline visit and did not receive any study medication and was not included in the modified intention-to-treat population but was still included in safety analyses. 75 (82%) of 91 in the tocilizumab group and 68 (76%) of 89 in the standard care group completed 28 days of follow-up. Progression of COVID-19 up to day 14 occurred in eight (9%) of 91 patients in the tocilizumab group and 11 (13%) of 88 in the standard care group (difference -3·71 [95% CI -18·23 to 11·19]; p=0·42). 33 (36%) of 91 patients in the tocilizumab group and 22 (25%) of 89 patients in the standard care group had adverse events; 18 (20%) and 15 (17%) had serious adverse events. The most common adverse event was acute respiratory distress syndrome, reported in seven (8%) patients in each group. Grade 3 adverse events were reported in two (2%) patients in the tocilizumab group and five (6%) patients in the standard care group. There were no grade 4 adverse events. Serious adverse events were reported in 18 (20%) patients in the tocilizumab group and 15 (17%) in the standard care group; 13 (14%) and 15 (17%) patients died during the study. INTERPRETATION: Routine use of tocilizumab in patients admitted to hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19 is not supported. However, post-hoc evidence from this study suggests tocilizumab might still be effective in patients with severe COVID-19 and so should be investigated further in future studies.

The host membrane protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the major receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and is a crucial determinant for cross-species transmission. In addition, some auxiliary receptors and cofactors are also involved that expand the host/tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2. After receptor engagement, specific proteases are required that cleave the S protein and trigger its fusogenic activity.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Posterior probabilities of an absolute decrease in mortality compared with control patients, by subgroups based on oxygen requirements, were calculated for corticosteroids and remdesivir. Probabilities of &#8805;1%, &#8805;2% and &#8805;5% absolute decrease in mortality were quantified. RESULTS: For patients needing mechanical ventilation, the probability of &#8805;1% absolute decrease in mortality was 4% for remdesivir and 93% for corticosteroids. For patients needing supplemental oxygen without mechanical ventilation, the probability of &#8805;1% absolute decrease in mortality was 81% for remdesivir and 93% for dexamethasone. Finally, for patients who did not need oxygen support, the probability of &#8805;1% absolute decrease in mortality was 29% for remdesivir and 4% for dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using a Bayesian analytic approach, remdesivir had low probability of achieving a clinically meaningful reduction in mortality, except for patients needing supplemental oxygen without mechanical ventilation. Corticosteroids were more promising for patients needing oxygen support, especially mechanical ventilation. While awaiting more definitive studies, this probabilistic interpretation of the evidence will help to guide treatment decisions for clinicians, as well as guideline and policy makers.","Lee, Todd C; McDonald, Emily G; Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Harrison, Luke B; Cheng, Matthew P; Brophy, James M",Int J Infect Dis,,615

382777,Pre-treatment pain sensitivity is associated with outcome following exercise therapy in patients with knee osteoarthritis - an observational study,2021,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is now considered a global public health threat. The primary focus has been on reducing the viral spread and treating respiratory symptoms; as time goes on, the impact of COVID-19 on neurological and haemostatic systems becomes more evident. The clinical data suggest that platelet hyperactivity plays a role in the pathology of COVID-19 from its onset and that platelets may serve critical functions during COVID-19 progression. Hyperactivation of blood platelets and the coagulation system are emerging as important drivers of inflammation and may be linked to the severity of the 'cytokine storm' induced in severe cases of COVID-19, in which disseminated intravascular coagulation, and platelet hyperactivity are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of mortality. We propose that targeting platelet hyperactivity in the early stages of COVID-19 infection may reduce the immunothrombotic complications of COVID-19 and subdue the systemic inflammatory response. Lowering baseline platelet activity may be of particular importance for higher-risk groups. As an alternative to antiplatelet drugs, an inappropriate intervention in public health, we propose that the dietary antiplatelet agent Fruitflow®, derived from tomatoes, may be considered a suitable therapy. Fruitflow® contains antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory compounds that target the mechanisms of platelet activation specific to COVID-19 and can be considered a safe and natural antiplatelet regime.","O039,; Kennedy, Niamh; Duttaroy, Asim K",Med Hypotheses,,615

Epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 have been examined but Socio-economic aspects of the issue have been less studied. Thus this study aimed to identify the role of human development index (HDI) in the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 worldwide. Methods: Information of the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 was obtained from the Worldometer and data about the HDI 2019 were obtained from the World Bank database. The correlation between incidence, mortality rates, and the HDI parameters were assessed using linear regression. We calculated concentration index (CI) to measure socioeconomic inequality in COVID-19 related mortality & incidence. Results: linear regression analysis showed a direct significant correlation between the incidence and mortality rate from COVID-19 and HDI at the global level. The concentration index was positive for incidence rate (0.62) and mortality rate (0.69) of COVID-19, indicating the higher concentration of the rates among groups with high HDI. Conclusions: The high incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in countries with high and very high HDI are remarkable which should be the top priority of interventions for global health policymakers. Also, the health programs should be provided to reduce the burden of this disease in the regions with high incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19.","Shahbazi, Fatemeh; Khazaei, Salman",New Microbes New Infect,,615

With higher burden of malaria in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries coupled with fragile healthcare system and delivery, these may pose a threat in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients co-infected with malaria. Free radicals have been implicated in the progression and pathogenesis of malaria and COVID-19 through Fenton's reaction and cytokine storm respectively. Methods: the current research comprises of seventy-four (74) participants; 20 apparently healthy controls and 54 COVID-19 patients (34 among which were co-infected with malaria). Serum levels of 8-iso PGF2&#945; and Alphatocopherol were determined among the study participants using ELISA technique and colorimetric assay, respectively. Results: results revealed statistically significant elevation of 8-iso PGF2&#945; in COVID-19 patients co-infected with malaria compared to COVID-19 patients only, and this may be due to increase production of free radicals. Furthermore, a significant decrease of Alphatocopherol was observed in COVID-19 co-infected with malaria compared to COVID-19 patients due to increase utilization of antioxidants in counterbalancing the negative effect of free radicals generated. Conclusion: conclusively, SARS-COV-2 patients co-infected with malaria might be predisposed to oxidative stress and low Alphatocopherol. The increase in oxidative stress is proportional to malaria parasite density and inversely related to Alphatocopherol levels. This implies that oxidative stress is notably higher and such patients may have a severer form of the COVID-19. Increased 8-iso-PGF2&#945; in co-infection and decreased alphatocopherol levels can reflect the severity and adverse outcomes compared to COVID-19 naïve because of their tremendous involvement in the pathogenesis and progression of diseases.","Muhammad, Yahaya; Aminu, Yamuna Kani; Ahmad, Abdurrahman Elfulaty; Iliya, Sani; Muhd, Nuruddeen; Yahaya, Mohammed; Mustapha, Aminu Sale; Tahiru, Abdulkhabir; Abdulkadir, Sulaiman Saeed; Ibrahim, Jamila Suleiman; Ahmad, Abdulmalik Binji; Muhammad, Idris Yahaya; Shehu, Zaharaddeen; Yakubu, Abdulrahman; Muhd, Bashir Kabir; Ahmed, Armaya039; Faruk, Umar Abubakar",Pan Afr Med J,,615

Worldwide, such services are underfunded and under-resourced, and services in Ireland are no different. It is vital that existing services are regularly reviewed for both efficacy and acceptability. Our objective was to review published studies evaluating service user satisfaction with CAMHS in Ireland and CAMHS therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were systematically searched. Studies were included if they reported on service user satisfaction or an evaluation of CAMHS in Ireland. RESULTS: From an initial 125 articles identified, 15 studies meet the inclusion criteria: four reporting on overall CAMHS satisfaction, three on satisfaction where a specific diagnosis was present, while eight evaluated various interventions offered. Whilst most service users perceived services to be satisfactory, important issues relating to accessibility were present. Evidence of efficacy was present for a small number of interventions, but studies were limited by methodological issues. CONCLUSIONS: There is a dearth of studies evaluating CAMHS in Ireland. The extant literature suggests a positive experience once accessed, but long waiting times and poor collaboration are seen to limit services users' experience. More robust methodologically sound studies are urgently required. Given the expected increased demand linked to the current COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the resultant compromised financial position, it is essential that scant resources are appropriately directed.","Leahy, D; McNicholas, F",Ir J Psychol Med,,615
387840,Challenges of the new coronavirus,2020,"After the March-April 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, a second contagion wave afflicted Europe in the autumn. The present study aimed to evaluate sleep health/patterns of Italians during this further challenging situation. A total of 2,013 Italians longitudinally participated in a web-based survey during the two contagion peaks of the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the risk factors for sleep disturbances during the second wave, and we compared sleep quality and psychological well-being between the two assessments (March-April and November-December 2020). Female gender, low education, evening chronotype, being a high-risk person for COVID-19 infection, reporting negative social or economic impact, and evening smartphone overuse predicted a higher risk of poor sleep and insomnia symptoms during the second wave. Advanced age, living with a high-risk person for COVID-19 infection, and having a relative/friend infected with COVID-19 before the prior 2 weeks were risk categories for poor sleep quality. Living with children, having contracted COVID-19 before the prior 2 weeks, being pessimistic about the vaccine and working in healthcare, were risk factors for insomnia symptoms. The follow-up assessment highlighted reduced insomnia symptoms and anxiety. Nevertheless, we found reduced sleep duration, higher daytime dysfunction, advanced bedtime and wake-up time, and a shift to morningness, confirming the alarming prevalence of poor sleepers (~60%) and severe depression (~20%) in a context of increased perceived stress. The present study showed a persistent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep and mental health. Large-scale interventions to counteract the chronicity and exacerbation of sleep and psychological disturbances are necessary, especially for the at-risk categories.","Salfi, Federico; D039,; Atri, Aurora; Tempesta, Daniela; Ferrara, Michele",J Sleep Res,,615

388537,United by the global COVID-19 pandemic: divided by our values and viral identities,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although an increasing number of pregnant women in resource-limited areas deliver in health-care facilities, maternal mortality remains high in these settings. Inadequate diagnosis and management of common life-threatening conditions is an important determinant of maternal mortality. We analysed the clinicopathological discrepancies in a series of maternal deaths from Mozambique and assessed changes over 10 years in the diagnostic process. We aimed to provide data on clinical diagnostic accuracy to be used for improving quality of care and reducing maternal mortality. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of clinicopathological discrepancies in 91 maternal deaths occurring from Nov 1, 2013, to March 31, 2015 (17 month-long period), at a tertiary-level hospital in Mozambique, using complete diagnostic autopsies as the gold standard to ascertain cause of death. We estimated the performance of the clinical diagnosis and classified clinicopathological discrepancies as major and minor errors. We compared the findings of this analysis with those of a similar study done in the same setting 10 years earlier. FINDINGS: We identified a clinicopathological discrepancy in 35 (38%) of 91 women. All diagnostic errors observed were classified as major discrepancies. The sensitivity of the clinical diagnosis for puerperal infections was 17% and the positive predictive value was 50%. The sensitivity for non-obstetric infections was 48%. The sensitivity for eclampsia was 100% but the positive predictive value was 33%. Over the 10-year period, the performance of clinical diagnosis did not improve, and worsened for some diagnoses, such as puerperal infection. INTERPRETATION: Decreasing maternal mortality requires improvement of the pre-mortem diagnostic process and avoidance of clinical errors by refining clinical skills and increasing the availability and quality of diagnostic tests. Comparison of post-mortem information with clinical diagnosis will help monitor the reduction of clinical errors and thus improve the quality of care.

389518,"Ethos of science, pathos of war: Social work and pandemic rhetoric",2021,"AIM: COVID-19 clinical presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic to severe cases. While there are a number of early publications relating to risk factors for COVID-19 infection, low sample size and heterogeneity in study design impacted consolidation of early findings. There is a pressing need to identify the factors which predispose patients to severe cases of COVID-19. For rapid and widespread risk stratification, these factors should be easily obtainable, inexpensive, and avoid invasive clinical procedures. The aim of our study is to fill this knowledge gap by systematically mapping all the available evidence on the association of various clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables with the risk of specific adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The systematic review was conducted using standardized methodology, searching two electronic databases (PubMed and SCOPUS) for relevant literature published between 1st January 2020 and 9th July 2020. Included studies reported characteristics of patients with COVID-19 while reporting outcomes relating to disease severity. In the case of sufficient comparable data, meta-analyses were conducted to estimate risk of each variable. RESULTS: Seventy-six studies were identified, with a total of 17,860,001 patients across 14 countries. The studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of the sample under study, outcomes, and risk measures reported. A large number of risk factors were presented for COVID-19. Commonly reported variables for adverse outcome from COVID-19 comprised patient characteristics, including age >75 (OR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.81-3.90), male sex (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.39-3.04) and severe obesity (OR: 2.57, 95% CI: 1.31-5.05). Active cancer (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.04-2.04) was associated with increased risk of severe outcome. A number of common symptoms and vital measures (respiratory rate and SpO2) also suggested elevated risk profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of this study, a range of easily assessed parameters are valuable to predict elevated risk of severe illness and mortality as a result of COVID-19, including patient characteristics and detailed comorbidities, alongside the novel inclusion of real-time symptoms and vital measurements.","Booth, Adam; Reed, Angus Bruno; Ponzo, Sonia; Yassaee, Arrash; Aral, Mert; Plans, David; Labrique, Alain; Mohan, Diwakar",PLoS One,,615
390547,Pandemic and protest in 2020: Questions and considerations for social work research,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Remdesivir is the current recommended anti-viral treatment in moderate-to-severe COVID-19. However, data on impact of timing of therapy, efficacy, and safety are limited. We evaluated the impact of timing of remdesivir initiation (symptom onset to remdesivir treatment [SORT] interval) on in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted between June 25 and October 3, 2020, at a tertiary care dedicated COVID center in India. Patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (moderate: SpO2 <94%; severe: SpO2 <90%) were included. The main outcome was impact of SORT interval on in-hospital all-cause mortality. Subgroups were formed and analyzed based on SORT interval. RESULTS: Of 350 patients treated with remdesivir, 346 were included in the final analysis. Overall, 76 (22.0%) patients died (moderate: 3 [2.8%], severe: 73 [30.8%]). All-cause mortality was significantly lower in patients with SORT interval &#8804;9 days (n = 260) vs SORT interval >9 days (n = 86; 18.1% vs 33.7%; p = 0.004). The odds of death were significantly lower in patients with SORT interval &#8804;9 days vs >9 days (odds ratio = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.25-0.75; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Remdesivir initiation &#8804;9 days from symptom onset was associated with mortality benefit, defining a treatment window and reinforcing the need for appropriately-timed remdesivir in moderate-to-severe COVID-19.","Mehta, Ravindra M; Bansal, Sameer; Bysani, Suhitha; Kalpakam, Hariprasad",Int J Infect Dis,,615

397080,Working: Glimpses of the pandemic from this fine place so far from home,2021,"BACKGROUND: Telephones, internet-connected devices (phablets, personal computers), chat platforms, and mobile apps (eg, Skype, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp) can be exploited for telemedicine applications. WhatsApp and similar apps are also widely used to facilitate clinical communication between physicians. Moreover, WhatsApp is used by emergency department (ED) physicians and consulting physicians to exchange medical information during ED consultations. This platform is regarded as a useful app in the consultation of dermatological and orthopedic cases. Preventing overcrowding in the ED is key to reducing the risk of disease transmission, and teleconsulting practice is thought to be effective in the diagnosis, treatment, and reduction of transmission risk of disease, most notably during the COVID-19 pandemic. Video consultation is highly recommended in some countries on the grounds that it is likely to reduce the risk of transmission. WhatsApp-like apps are among the video consultation platforms that are assumed to reduce the risk of contamination by minimizing patient-physician contact. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of WhatsApp video consultation on patient admission and discharge times in comparison to bedside consultation in the evaluation of potential patients with COVID-19 visiting a COVID-19 outpatient clinic during the pandemic. METHODS: Patients who presented to the ED COVID-19 outpatient clinic between March 11 and May 31, 2020, and for whom an infectious disease specialist was consulted (via WhatsApp or at bedside) were included in the study in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eventually, 54 patients whose consultations were performed via WhatsApp and 90 patients whose consultations were performed at bedside were included in our study. RESULTS: The median length of stay in the ED of discharged patients amounted to 103 minutes (IQR 85-147.75) in the WhatsApp group and 196 minutes (IQR 141-215) in the bedside group. In this regard, the length of stay in the ED was found to be significantly shorter in the WhatsApp group than in the bedside group (P<.001). Among the consulted and discharged patients, 1 patient in each group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction test and thus was readmitted and hospitalized (P=.62). The median length of stay of the inpatients in the ED was found to be 116.5 minutes (IQR 85.5-145.5) in the WhatsApp group and 132 minutes (IQR 102-168) in the bedside group. The statistical analysis of this time difference revealed that the length of stay in the ED was significantly shorter for patients in the WhatsApp group than in the bedside group (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Consultation via WhatsApp reduces both contact time with patients with COVID-19 and the number of medical staff contacting the patients, which contributes greatly to reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. WhatsApp consultation may prove useful in clinical decision making as well as in shortening process times. Moreover, it does not result in a decreased accuracy rate. The shortened discharge and hospitalization timespans also decreased the length of stay in the ED, which can have an impact on minimizing ED crowding.

399656,[Perceptions of students confined by the COVID-19 pandemic on distance learning in medicine],2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with high morbidity and mortality. There are very limited data on the interference of immunomodulating drugs on the risk of infection and on the course of the disease. In particular, there are no current clinical data about the interference exerted by dupilumab, a biologic drugs blocking IL-4 and IL-13, used for adult atopic dermatitis. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is complex, characterized by an immune response mainly Th1/Th17. The hyper-activation of these cells may cause the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that may result in lung impairment. IL-4 and IL-13 are Th2 cytokines, thus being part of a pathway not considered implicated in host defense mechanism against viral infections. Indeed, viral infections, including respiratory infections, have not been reported as a significant adverse event in clinical trials. Furthermore, dupilumab has been proved to be efficacious also in exacerbations of asthma, and it is known that viral infections can worsen asthma. Therefore, the current data seem to suggest that treatment with dupilumab should not be stopped during COVID-19 pandemic. Obviously, a careful assessment is mandatory for each individual patient and further studies are necessary to characterize the immunologic responses in COVID-19.","Patruno, Cataldo; Stingeni, Luca; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Hansel, Katharina; Napolitano, Maddalena",Dermatol Ther,,615

Health authorities have cautioned that such theories, although not questioning the existence of the pandemic, may increase the spread of the virus by reducing people's efforts to socially distance. METHODS: We test this proposition empirically using longitudinal survey data collected at five timepoints during the early outbreak of the virus in the US (N = 403). RESULTS: Multivariate growth curve analyses showed that, although conspiracy beliefs decreased and social distancing increased over time, people holding more conspiracy beliefs at the beginning of the pandemic showed the lowest increase in social distancing. Moreover, cross-lagged analyses demonstrated that people who reported more conspiracy beliefs at any wave tended to report less social distancing at the following wave. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that COVID-19 conspiracy theories pose a significant threat to public health as they may reduce adherence to social distancing measures.","Bierwiaczonek, Kinga; Kunst, Jonas R; Pich, Olivia",Applied psychology.

In this study, we are upgrading the MPT to help users easily merge phantoms at any axis, with any angle using the ""vector rotation"" technique. The segmented structure information of the contact's phantom is also included in the calculation using the GEANT4 ""parallel geometry"" utility. The calculation is applied to the case of a male cancer patient who used I-131 lying on a bed, and a male caregiver standing beside the patient. The equivalent dose rate to the thyroid of the caregiver is calculated at 0.3, 0.5, 0.8 and 1m away from the patient, when the caregiver is standing near the patient's abdomen, chest and neck area. The results show that the dose rate to the thyroid of the male contact greatly depends on his standing position and there are clear differences between the results calculated with the point source and those calculated with the patient source. In summary, using activity distributions in the patient's body as well as the right communication circumstance helps to calculate the optimal dose for people who has been in contact with patients.","Phuong Thao, Nguyen Thi; Dubois, Pedro Arce; Trung, Nguyen Thien; Nguyen Vo, Khoa Anh; Duy, Nguyen Khanh; Son, Nguyen Dong",J. radiol. prot,,615
402340,Dimensões do cuidado na perspectiva da espiritualidade durante a pandemia pelo novo coronavírus (COVID-19),2020,"BACKGROUND: Excess visceral fat (VF) or high body mass index (BMI) is risk factors for severe COVID-19. The receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is expressed at higher levels in the VF than in the subcutaneous fat (SCF) of obese patients. AIM: To show that visceral fat accumulation better predicts severity of COVID-19 outcome compared to either SCF amounts or BMI. METHODS: We selected patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and a computed tomography (CT) scan. Severe COVID-19 was defined as requirement for mechanical ventilation or death. Fat depots were quantified on abdominal CT scan slices and the measurements were correlated with the clinical outcomes. ACE 2 mRNA levels were quantified in fat depots of a separate group of non-COVID-19 subjects using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Among 165 patients with a mean BMI of 26.1â¯±â¯5.4â¯kg/m2, VF was associated with severe COVID-19 (pâ¯=â¯0.022) and SCF was not (pâ¯=â¯0.640). Subcutaneous fat was not different in patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and the SCF/VF ratio was lower in patients with severe COVID-19 (pâ¯=â¯0.010). The best predictive value for severe COVID-19 was found for a VF area &#8805;128.5â¯cm2 (ROC curve), which was independently associated with COVID-19 severity (pâ¯<â¯0.001). In an exploratory analysis, ACE 2 mRNA positively correlated with BMI in VF but not in SCF of non-COVID-19 patients (r2â¯=â¯0.27 vs 0.0008). CONCLUSION: Severe forms of COVID-19 are associated with high visceral adiposity in European adults. On the basis of an exploratory analysis ACE 2 in the visceral fat may be a trigger for the cytokine storm, and this needs to be clarified by future studies.","Favre, Guillaume; Legueult, Kevin; Pradier, Christian; Raffaelli, Charles; Ichai, Carole; Iannelli, Antonio; Redheuil, Alban; Lucidarme, Olivier; Esnault, Vincent",Metabolism,,615
403413,"What COVID-19 has brought us to: Art, activism, and changes in social work education",2021,"Proliferative kidney disease (PKD) is a widespread temperature-dependent disease in salmonids caused by the myxozoan parasite, Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae (Canning, Curry, Feist, Longshaw et Okamura, 1999) (Tb). Tb has a two-host life cycle, involving fish as an intermediate host and freshwater bryozoans as the definitive host. Although salmonids are acknowledged as hosts for the parasite, it is less clear which fish species are active hosts in the life cycle of Tb. Differences in infection dynamics have been observed between some fish species, which are thought to be related to the existence of two main Tb-strains, the American and European. Iceland, having three species of indigenous salmonids and positioned geographically between Europe and North America, is an ideal location to study the natural development of Tb in wild fish. The main aim of this study was to determine the genetic origin of Tb in Iceland and confirm whether mature spores are produced in Icelandic salmonids. In this study, Icelandic salmonids were infected with the European Tb-strain. In situ hybridisation revealed that intraluminal sporogonic stages, including mature spores, were commonly observed in all three salmonid species. The presence of intraluminal stages has previously been confirmed in brown trout Salmo trutta Linnaeus and Atlantic salmon S. salar Linnaeus in Europe, but they have only been observed in Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (Linnaeus) in North America, infected by the local strain. This is, therefore, the first time that sporogonic stages have been observed in Arctic charr in Europe, where fish are infected with the European Tb-strain. Our data strongly suggest that all the three salmonid species inhabiting Icelandic waters serve as active hosts in the life cycle of Tb. However, for full confirmation, transmission trials are needed.","Svavarsdottir, Fjola Rut; Freeman, Mark A; Antonsson, Thorolfur; Arnason, Fridhthjofur; Kristmundsson, Arni",Folia parasitol,,615

In this study, we employ machine learning to relate characteristics of the polyclonal antibody response raised by natural infection to diverse antibody effector functions and neutralization potency with the goal of generating both accurate predictions of each activity based on antibody response profiles as well as insights into antibody mechanisms of action. To this end, antibody-mediated phagocytosis, cytotoxicity, complement deposition, and neutralization were accurately predicted from biophysical antibody profiles in both discovery and validation cohorts. These predictive models identified SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM as a key predictor of neutralization activity whose mechanistic relevance was supported experimentally by depletion. Validated models of how different aspects of the humoral response relate to antiviral antibody activities suggest desirable attributes to recapitulate by vaccination or other antibody-based interventions.","Natarajan, Harini; Xu, Shiwei; Crowley, Andrew R.; Butler, Ssavannah E.; Weiner, Joshua A.; Bloch, Evan M; Littlefield, Kirsten; Benner, Sarah E.; Shrestha, Ruchee; Ajayi, Olivia; Weiland-Alter, Wendy F.; Sullivan, David J; Shoham, Shmuel; Quinn, Thomas; Casadevall, Arturo; Pekosz, Andrew; Redd, Andrew; Tobian, Aaron AR; Connor, Ruth I.; Wright, Peter F.; Ackerman, Margaret E",,,615
405337,Canadian reflections on the Covid-19 pandemic in social work education: from tsunami to innovation,2020,"BACKGROUND: The cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical information about patients undergoing lung resection while infected with this virus and pathological information about early COVID-19 pneumonia are still scarce. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old male patient underwent a right pneumonectomy for squamous cell lung carcinoma. Until the fourth postoperative day, the patient, who had minor radiological changes on chest x-ray, was asymptomatic. From this day, the COVID-19 test, which was performed after the appearance of symptoms such as fever and shortness of breath, lymphopenia and diffuse ground glass opacity in the left lung on computed tomography, was reported to be positive. The patient was given NIMV (non-invasive mechanical ventilation), and hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and azithromycin in isolation intensive care, with the diagnosis of severe pneumonia. He was discharged on the 17th postoperative day with healing of the lung lesions. The pathology specimen of the patient, who was found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before the day of surgery, was examined retrospectively. Irregular and severe pneumocyte hyperplasia, interstitial thickening, oedema, pronounced protein exudates, diffuse enlargement of the alveolar walls, macrophage infiltration and fibroblastic proliferation, which is an indicator of early organisation, were detected. CONCLUSION: We believe that the clinical course and pathology findings obtained after right pneumonectomy in a patient with pre-symptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia will guide the diagnosis and treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Çinar, Hüseyi N Ulas; Ince, Özgür; Çelik, Burçin; Saltabas, Faruk; Özbek, Muharrem",Swiss Med Wkly,,615

METHODS: We designed a retrospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering from the international COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium study to comprehensively describe CRS-calculated as: tidal volume/[airway plateau pressure-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)]-and its association with ventilatory management and outcomes of COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation (MV), admitted to intensive care units (ICU) worldwide. RESULTS: We studied 745 patients from 22 countries, who required admission to the ICU and MV from January 14 to December 31, 2020, and presented at least one value of CRS within the first seven days of MV. Median (IQR) age was 62 (52-71), patients were predominantly males (68%) and from Europe/North and South America (88%). CRS, within 48 h from endotracheal intubation, was available in 649 patients and was neither associated with the duration from onset of symptoms to commencement of MV (p = 0.417) nor with PaO2/FiO2 (p = 0.100). Females presented lower CRS than males (95% CI of CRS difference between females-males: - 11.8 to - 7.4 mL/cmH2O p < 0.001), and although females presented higher body mass index (BMI), association of BMI with CRS was marginal (p = 0.139). Ventilatory management varied across CRS range, resulting in a significant association between CRS and driving pressure (estimated decrease - 0.31 cmH2O/L per mL/cmH20 of CRS, 95% CI - 0.48 to - 0.14, p < 0.001). Overall, 28-day ICU mortality, accounting for the competing risk of being discharged within the period, was 35.6% (SE 1.7). Cox proportional hazard analysis demonstrated that CRS (+ 10 mL/cm H2O) was only associated with being discharge from the ICU within 28 days (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02-1.28, p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: This multicentre report provides a comprehensive account of CRS in COVID-19 patients on MV. CRS measured within 48 h from commencement of MV has marginal predictive value for 28-day mortality, but was associated with being discharged from ICU within the same period.

We sought to characterize the impact of stay-at-home orders on our study of cerebral autoregulation and its association with developmental delays in infants with congenital heart disease compared with healthy controls. DESIGN AND METHODS: We calculated the number of participants recruited (i.e., not enrolled in the study) and assessed (i.e., currently enrolled) before March 2020 (pre-COVID-19) and the number of participants that we could not recruit or assess between March and July 2020 (missed due to COVID-19), separately for congenital heart disease and healthy control infants, in reference to the impacts of COVID-19. We used negative binomial regressions to determine incidence rate ratios which compared participants recruited and assessed pre-COVID-19 and missed due to COVID-19. RESULTS: Recruitment and assessments significantly decreased following the pandemic, i.e., participants were more likely to be recruited or be assessed pre-COVID-19 compared to during the pandemic. Study participants were 3.3 times as likely to have assessments performed pre-COVID-19 compared to during the COVID-19 pandemic (p < 0.001). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Clinical research teams may consider making protocol modifications such as virtual visits or video recordings explaining the study, for example, to adjust to the restrictions caused by COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic drastically reduced recruitment and assessments completed in our study. Study teams will need to continue to modify procedures for recruitment and assessments that align with COVID-19 regulations to facilitate research progress during the pandemic.","Tran, Nhu N; Tran, Michelle; Lopez, Jeraldine; Woon, Jessica; Nguyen, Jennifer; Brecht, Mary-Lynn",J Pediatr Nurs,,615

408238,A Critical Guide to the SEND Code of Practice 0-25 Years (2015),2020,"The issue of the COVID-19 pandemic occupies the agenda of the whole world. The pivot of this pandemic is a crucial element that has become almost as important as the virus itself, namely the lockdown. Although, the rationale for lockdown is well-sustained by strong epidemiological arguments, exploring the 'other' unwanted consequences of the contemporary COVID-19 pandemic is mandatory for coagulating a robust agreed position against the numerous problems generated by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Starting from the rationale of the lockdown, in this paper we explored and exposed the other consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic measures such as the use or abuse of human rights and freedom restrictions, economic issues, marginalized groups and eclipse of all other diseases. Our scientific attempt is to coagulate a stable position and integrate current opposing views by advancing the idea that rather than applying the uniform lockdown policy, one could recommend instead an improved model targeting more strict and more prolonged lockdowns to vulnerable risk/age groups while enabling less stringent measures for the lower-risk groups, minimizing both economic losses and deaths. Rigorous (and also governed by freedom) debating may be able to synchronize the opposed perspectives between those advocating an extreme lockdown (e.g., most of the epidemiologists and health experts), and those criticizing all restrictive measures (e.g., economists and human rights experts). Confronting the multiple facets of the public health mitigation measures is the only way to avoid contributing to history with yet another failure, as seen in other past epidemics.","Burlacu, Alexandru; Crisan-Dabija, Radu; Covic, Adrian; Raiu, Catalin; Mavrichi, Ionut; Popa, Iolanda Valentina; Lillo-Crespo, Manuel",Rev Cardiovasc Med,,615

This study examines income-related health inequalities and their main contributors in China during the pandemic. METHODS: The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey is an anonymous 74-item survey administered via social media in China. A national sample of 10,545 adults in all 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in mainland China provided comprehensive data on sociodemographic characteristics, awareness and attitudes towards COVID-19, lifestyle factors, and health outcomes during the lockdown. Of them, 8448 subjects provided data for this analysis. Concentration Index (CI) and Corrected CI (CCI) were used to measure income-related inequalities in mental health and self-reported health (SRH), respectively. Wagstaff-type decomposition analysis was used to identify contributors to health inequalities. RESULTS: Most participants reported their health status as ""very good"" (39.0%) or ""excellent"" (42.3%). CCI of SRH and mental health were - 0.09 (p < 0.01) and 0.04 (p < 0.01), respectively, indicating pro-poor inequality in ill SRH and pro-rich inequality in ill mental health. Income was the leading contributor to inequalities in SRH and mental health, accounting for 62.7% (p < 0.01) and 39.0% (p < 0.05) of income-related inequalities, respectively. The COVID-19 related variables, including self-reported family-member COVID-19 infection, job loss, experiences of food and medication shortage, engagement in physical activity, and five different-level pandemic regions of residence, explained substantial inequalities in ill SRH and ill mental health, accounting for 29.7% (p < 0.01) and 20.6% (p < 0.01), respectively. Self-reported family member COVID-19 infection, experiencing food and medication shortage, and engagement in physical activity explain 9.4% (p < 0.01), 2.6% (the summed contributions of experiencing food shortage (0.9%) and medication shortage (1.7%), p < 0.01), and 17.6% (p < 0.01) inequality in SRH, respectively (8.9% (p < 0.01), 24.1% (p < 0.01), and 15.1% (p < 0.01) for mental health). CONCLUSIONS: Per capita household income last year, experiences of food and medication shortage, self-reported family member COVID-19 infection, and physical activity are important contributors to health inequalities, especially mental health in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Intervention programs should be implemented to support vulnerable groups.","Nie, Peng; Ding, Lanlin; Chen, Zhuo; Liu, Shiyong; Zhang, Qi; Shi, Zumin; Wang, Lu; Xue, Hong; Liu, Gordon G; Wang, Youfa",Int J Equity Health,,615

411925,A investigação em serviços de saúde e a pandemia de COVID-19./ Health services research and the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"This article reviews the correlation between ACE2 and COVID-19 and the resulting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The classical ACE-angiotensin â ¡ (Ang II)-angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis and the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in RAS system. ACE2 antagonises the activation of the classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis and protects against lung injury. Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) also uses ACE2 for cell entry. ARDS is a clinical high-mortality disease which is probably due to the excessive activation of RAS caused by 2019-nCoV infection, and ACE2 has a protective effect on ARDS caused by COVID-19. Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on ARDS, the development of drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the near future.

414209,Working it out-Hospital social work in the midst of a pandemic,2020,"The objective was to evaluate the interactions of genotype-environment effects on the components of (co)variance estimates and the prediction of breeding values for weaning weight in Nelore cattle, using a Bayesian approach. Records of 16,644 weaning weights were used from cattle distributed in ten ranches across six Brazilian states. The genetic parameters were estimated under an animal model considering Bayesian statistics. To verify genotype-environment interaction effects, we analyzed the following matrix model: without the inclusion of genotype-environment interaction effects, and with the inclusion of genotype-environment interaction effects, which considered the effect of sire-year, sire-herd, and both effects. In general, the results suggest that the inclusion of genotype-environment interaction in genetic analysis for weight at weaning tends to alter the estimates of genetic and environment (co)variances. The Spearman correlations between the breeding values were above 97%, indicating practically no change in the classification of animals evaluated. It can be inferred that the interaction effects of sire-year and sire-herd do not change the animals rank, and if not included in the genetic evaluation, the selection based on predictions of breeding values for weaning weight will not be affected.","Ubirajara de Faria, Carina; Pereira Terra, Juliano; Jun Iti Yokoo, Marcos; Ulhôa Magnabosco, Cláudio; Galvao de Albuquerque, Lucia; Barbosa Lôbo, Raysildo",Acta Sci.

This study aimed to investigate possible risk factors for ER and provide further empirical data for prevention and clinical treatment strategies. METHODS: A retrospective investigation of 116 concurrent ER cases was conducted. Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between each potential risk (or protective) factor and ER. The clinical characteristics of the 71 hospitalized patients were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: After screening, the following variables significantly increased the risk of ER: shorter length of service (recruits, odds ratios [OR] 7.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.58-21.75), higher body mass index (BMI, OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.03-1.26), lack of physical exercise in the last half year (< once a month, OR 3.20, 95%CI 1.08-9.44), and prior heat injury (OR 2.94, 95%CI 1.26-6.89). Frequent fruit consumption (OR 0.57, 95%CI 0.33-0.99), active hydration habit (OR 0.37, 95%CI 0.20-0.67), water replenishment &#8805;2 L on the training day (OR 0.15, 95%CI 0.05-0.45), and water replenishment &#8805;500 mL within 1 h before training (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.12-0.88) significantly decreased the risk of ER. Of the 71 hospitalized patients, 41 (57.7%) were diagnosed with hypokalemia on admission. DISCUSSION: In military training, emphasis should be placed on incremental adaptation training prior to more intense training, and close attention should be given to overweight and previously sedentary recruits. Fluid replenishment before exercise, increased fruit intake, and proper potassium supplementation may help prevent ER.","Han-Ding, Mao; Xin, Li; Shu-Yuan, Liu; Ling, Xing; Jin-Bao, Zhao; Zhi-Jun, Tan; Hai-Long, Sun; Qing, Song",Muscle nerve,,615

As a response, the LTCI (long-term care insurance) system has been executed among European countries and piloted in 15 cities of China in 2016. Subsequently, the influence and dilemma of LTCI system have become a hot academic topic in the past 20 years. Methods: The review was carried out to reveal the effects of the LTCI system on different economic entities by reviewing relevant literature published from January 2008 to September 2019. The quality of 25 quantitative and 24 qualitative articles was evaluated using the JBI and CASP critical evaluation checklist, respectively. Results: The review systematically examines the effects of the LTCI system on different microeconomic entities such as caretakers or their families and macroeconomic entities such as government spending. The results show that the LTCI system has a great impact on social welfare. For example, LTCI has a positive effect on the health and life quality of the disabled elderly. However, the role of LTCI in alleviating the financial burden on families with the disabled elderly may be limited. Conclusion: Implementation of LTCI system not only in reducing the physical and mental health problems of health care recipients and providers, and the economic burden of their families, but also promote the development of health care service industry and further improvement of the health care system. However, the dilemma and sustainable development of the LTCI system is the government needs to focus on in the future due to the sustainability of its funding sources.","Chen, Linhong; Xu, Xiaocang",J.

419554,Institutional and programmatic determinants for graduate public affairs’ online education: Assessing the influence of faculty workload,2021,"The present work analyses the lessons learnt from the Covid19 (Coronavirus) pandemic that could possibly apply to the energy sector, with a special focus to decarbonizing transport. Distinguishing between short/medium- and medium/long-term options, the scope is to discuss how issues such energy security, energy storage and energy system resilience should deserve more attention. Today, fuel demand has fallen to unprecedented levels, with jet fuel demand being the most affected one. Oil price is at the lowest values recorded for many years while on 20 April it even reached a negative price in the US for the first time in history. While in the short-term low oil prices would be attractive, the long-term negative consequences could be very relevant, with significant associated costs for the EU economy and Member states (MS) related to the collapse of demand and to the socio-economic impacts. New measures should thus be considered in the post Covid19 strategy. In particular, while in a short- to medium-term view the oil sector will require specific support measures to overcome the economic and physical shock brought in by the pandemic, in a medium to long-term perspective domestic sources such as Renewable and Recycled Carbon Fuels (RRCF) should be regarded as a way to secure energy supply, leading to significant technical and economic advantages. Thus, EU should allocate adequate resources in the post-Covid recovery plans to definitely allow the transition to renewable energy sources and particularly to bio-based economy and stainable transport fuels. Decarbonisation of transport through RRCF and economic recovery do not compete, but rather represent a win-win solution in a well-designed and sustainable implementation strategy, especially when low or zero interest-rate investments are foreseen. The EU should take the opportunity to match the UN SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) and EU Green Deal goals with the need to inject economic and financial resources into the real economy improving the socio-economic conditions of EU populations. Both agroforestry and RRCF industry are ready to produce (biomass) or source (waste) the feedstocks as well as the technologies, systems and components needed by the industry along the whole value chain. The roadmap to cleaner transport fuels thus represent an evident opportunity to meet climate, economic and societal post-Covid19 goals, in a win-win-win approach.","Chiaramonti, David; Maniatis, Kyriakos",Appl.

Despite the wealth of technological progress at the time of the crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus: Virus that causes current Pandemic situation (COVID-19), the global population had long been exposed beforehand to an acute absence of essential medical devices. As a response, a new type of composite materials intended for rapid prototyping, based on layered silicate saponite (Sap), antimicrobial dye phloxine B (PhB) and thermoplastics, has been recently developed. Design/methodology/approach: Sap was modified with a cationic surfactant and subsequently functionalized with PhB. The hybrid material in powder form was then grounded with polyethylene terephthalate-glycol (PETG) or polylactic acid (PLA) in a precisely defined weight ratio and extruded into printing filaments. The stability and level of cytotoxicity of these materials in various physiological environments simulating the human body have been studied. The applicability of these materials in bacteria and a yeast-infected environment was evaluated. Findings: Ideal content of the hybrid material, with respect to thermoplastic, was 15 weight %. Optimal printing temperature and speed, with respect to maintaining antimicrobial activity of the prepared materials, were T = 215°C at 50 mm/s for PETG/SapPhB and T = 230°C at 40 mm/s for PLA/SapPhB. 3 D-printed air filters made of these materials could keep inner air flow at 63.5% and 76.8% of the original value for the PLA/SapPhB and PETG/SapPhB, respectively, whereas the same components made without PhB had a 100% reduction of airflow. Practical implications: The designed materials can be used for rapid prototyping of medical devices. Originality/value: The new materials have been immediately used in the construction of an emergency lung ventilator, Q-vent, which has been used in different countries during the COVID-19 crisis. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Furka, S.; Furka, D.; Dadi, N.

Stress detection using physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), skin conductance (SC), electromyogram (EMG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) is a traditional approach. However, the effect of stress on the EMG signal of different muscles and the efficacy of combination of the EMG and other biological signals for stress detection have not been taken into account yet. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the EMG signal of the right and left trapezius and right and left erector spinae muscles for multi-level stress recognition. Also, the ECG signal was employed to evaluate the efficacy of EMG signals for stress detection. METHODS: Both EMG and ECG signals were acquired simultaneously from 34 healthy students (23 females and 11 males, aged 20-37 years). Mental arithmetic, Stroop color-word test, time pressure, and stressful environment were employed to induce stress in the laboratory. RESULTS: The accuracies of stress recognition in two, three and four levels were 100%, 97.6%, and 96.2%, respectively, obtained from the distinct combination of feature selection and machine learning algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of stress detection accuracies resulted from EMG and ECG indicators demonstrated the strong ability and the effectiveness of EMG signal for multi-level stress detection.","Pourmohammadi, Sara; Maleki, Ali",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,615

424080,Sharing the Love of Reading: A South African Story,2020,"We aim at clarifying the controversy about the effects of school openings or closures on the course of the Covid-19 pandemic. The mathematical analysis of compartmental models with subpopulations shows that the in-school contact rates affects the overall course of the pandemic only above a certain threshold that separates an influence phase from a non-influence one. The threshold, that we calculate via linear approximation in several cases, seems to appear in all contexts, including outbreaks or new strains upsurge, lockdowns, and vaccination campaigns excluding children, albeit with different values. Our theoretical findings are then confirmed by several data-driven studies that have previously identified the phase transition in specific cases. Specific outcomes of this study are: opposite conclusions reached by studies of the same or similar situations might depend on, possibly small, differences in modeling or in parameter estimation from the very noisy Covid-19 data, that result in identifying different phases; it is possible to keep schools open at any stage of the Covid-19 pandemic, but suitably strict rules must be applied at all times or else this becomes highly detrimental to virus containment efforts; as the threshold during vaccination turns out to correspond to the internal transmission rate that would lead to virus extinction if the school population was isolated, the needed strict control can be sustained only for very brief periods; as a result, either schools will have to face a prolonged closure or children need to be vaccinated as well.","Gandolfi, Alberto; Aspri, Andrea; Beretta, Elena; Jamshad, Khola; Jiang, Muyan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04136v2.pdf,615

Special attention should be placed towards protecting the health of care workers who are highly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Research and clinical trials involving COVID-19 patients and healthy human volunteers must be done in strict adherence to the fundamental principles of bioethics, even if finding a solution is an urgent need.

428015,Emotion governance and practice resilience in the reflexive modernity: How community social workers in a low-risk Chinese city work with people from Wuhan,2020,"BACKGROUND: Immunization rates among the adult population in Poland are below desired targets, urging the need to expand this service in the community. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ultimate goals for limiting the spread of the infection are vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Pharmaceutical companies are in a race for the fastest possible way to deliver vaccines. Community pharmacists in Poland are recognised as an accessible yet underutilised group of medical professionals. Therefore, involving pharmacists in vaccinations may have beneficial results for the healthcare system. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to assess the readiness and willingness of community pharmacists following the Pharmacist Without Borders project who had either been trained or not in providing immunization services, and to identify the factors that may support the implementation of such services in Poland. METHODS: This study was conducted among pharmacists between February and August 2020 in Poland. A survey was developed to determine their readiness to provide vaccination services in their pharmacies, to recognise any barriers to vaccinations, as well as the factors necessary to implement vaccination services in Polish pharmacies. RESULTS: A total of 1777 pharmacists participated in the study, comprising 127 (7.1%) pharmacists trained in vaccinations during the Pharmacists Without Borders project and 1650 (92.9%) pharmacists not participating in the workshops. Pharmacists participating in the workshops more often indicated that providing vaccinations in community pharmacies would improve the overall vaccination rate (p = 0.0001), and that pharmacists could play an important role in advertising and promoting vaccinations (p = 0.0001). For the pharmacists not participating in the workshops, they indicated to a much greater extent possible barriers affecting the readiness to provide vaccinations in pharmacies. They most often pointed out that vaccination services would result in a significant workload increase (p = 0.0001), that pharmacies were not adapted to immunization, and that there were not enough training courses for pharmacists (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The pharmacists working in community pharmacies indicated many advantages of vaccinations in pharmacies. This study identified barriers to the introduction of vaccinations and factors necessary to implement these services in pharmacies. The pharmacists trained during the immunization programme of the Pharmacists Without Borders project showed a greater readiness to provide immunization services.","Merks, Piotr; Religioni, Urszula; Bilmin, Krzysztof; Lewicki, Jedrzej; Jakubowska, Marta; Waksmundzka-Walczuk, Anna; Czerw, Aleksandra; Baranska, Agnieszka; Bogusz, Joanna; Plagens-Rotman, Katarzyna; Swietlik, Dariusz; Drelich, Ewelina; Swieczkowski, Damian; Lambert, Jane; Jaguszewski, Milosz; Juszczyk, Grzegorz; Balkhi, Bander; Vaillancourt, Regis",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,615

With massive externally induced change, what stays, what shifts, what disappears? This paper considers spatial adaptability, spatial resilience in two comparative, yet different contexts to identify design-based questions and propose thematic responses addressing resilient liveable future urbanism.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a significantly higher mortality rate than seasonal influenza and has disproportionately affected older adults, especially those with cardiovascular disease and related risk factors. Adverse cardiovascular sequelae, such as myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure, have been reported in patients with COVID-19. No established treatment is currently available; however, several therapies, including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitors, are being used off-label and evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. Considering these therapies are not familiar to cardiovascular clinicians managing these patients, this review describes the pharmacology of these therapies in the context of their use in patients with cardiovascular-related conditions.","Dixon, Dave L; Van Tassell, Benjamin W; Vecchié, Alessandra; Bonaventura, Aldo; Talasaz, Azita H; Kakavand, Hessam; DÊ¼Ascenzo, Fabrizio; Perciaccante, Antonio; Castagno, Davide; Ammirati, Enrico; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Stevens, Michael P; Abbate, Antonio",J Cardiovasc Pharmacol,,615

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Ion AmpliSeq&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel in sequencing the entire viral genome in different samples. SARS-CoV-2 sequence data were obtained from ten viral isolates and one nasopharyngeal swab from different patients. The ten isolate samples amplified with 12 PCR cycles displayed high mean depth values compared to those of the two isolates amplified with 20 PCR cycles. High mean depth values were also obtained for the nasopharyngeal swab processed by use of a target-specific reverse transcription. The relative depth of coverage (rDoC) analysis showed that when 12 PCR cycles were used, all target regions were amplified with high sequencing coverage, while in libraries amplified at 20 cycles, a poor uniformity of amplification, with absent or low coverage of many target regions, was observed.

This study was conducted to establish an objective and reliable method for analyzing the transfer of colored cosmetics onto face masks. METHODS: A total of 24 women participated in this test. The participants were requested to wear Korean Filter 94 masks after having applied colored cosmetics on their faces and lips. VISIA-CR was used to photograph the face, and a camera was used to photograph the mask, which had smeared the cosmetics. Each image was analyzed using the Image-pro® 10 image analysis software. RESULTS: Immediately after applying the cosmetics, the intensity of the face decreased and the redness of the lips increased when compared with the results 30 minutes after washing the face. After wearing a mask, the intensity increased and the redness decreased when compared with immediately after applying the cosmetics. The area before and after the colored cosmetics smeared onto the mask was increased. CONCLUSION: It is expected that this study could be used as a reference for further experiments on analysis of methods for preventing mask stains.","Kim, Suyeon; Lee, Juseon; Park, Minhye; Kim, Hongbi; Kim, Sungeun; Byun, Ji Won; Hwang-Bo, Jeon; Park, Keun Hyung",Skin res. technol,,615

Binding of the virus to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important step in the infection mechanism. However, it is unknown if ACE2 expression in patients with chronic lung diseases (CLDs), such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), or pulmonary fibrosis (PF), is changed as compared to controls. We used lung samples from patients with COPD (n = 28), IPAH (n = 10), and PF (n = 10) as well as healthy control donor (n = 10) tissue samples to investigate the expression of ACE2 and related cofactors that might influence the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Expression levels of the ACE2 receptor, the putative receptor CD147/BSG, and the viral entry cofactors TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2), EZR, and FURIN were determined by quantitative PCR and in open-access RNA sequencing datasets. Immunohistochemical and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analyses were used for localization and coexpression, respectively. Soluble ACE2 (sACE2) plasma levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In COPD as compared to donor, IPAH, and PF lung tissue, gene expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and EZR was significantly elevated, but circulating sACE2 levels were significantly reduced in COPD and PF plasma compared to healthy control and IPAH plasma samples. Lung tissue expressions of FURIN and CD147/BSG were downregulated in COPD. None of these changes were associated with changes in pulmonary hemodynamics. Histological analysis revealed coexpression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Ezrin in bronchial regions and epithelial cells. This was confirmed by scRNAseq analysis. There were no significant expression changes of the analyzed molecules in the lung tissue of IPAH and idiopathic PF as compared to control. In conclusion, we reveal increased ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in lung tissue with a concomitant decrease of protective sACE2 in COPD patients. These changes represent the possible risk factors for an increased susceptibility of COPD patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Fließer, Elisabeth; Birnhuber, Anna; Marsh, Leigh M; Gschwandtner, Elisabeth; Klepetko, Walter; Olschewski, Horst; Kwapiszewska, Grazyna","J. pathol., Clin. res",,615

However, the available data are limited, inconsistent and conflicting. Besides, no randomised controlled trial exists in this regard. Hence, the present meta-analysis was conducted to provide an updated summary and collate the effect of statin use on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 using unadjusted and adjusted risk estimates. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were systematically searched using appropriate keywords till December 18 2020, to identify observational studies reporting clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients using statins versus those not using statins. Prior and in-hospital use of statins were considered. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Unadjusted and adjusted pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% CIs were calculated. RESULTS: We included 14 observational studies pooling data retrieved from 19 988 patients with COVID-19. All the studies were of high/moderate quality. Pooled analysis of unadjusted data showed that statin use was not associated with improved clinical outcomes (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.50, p=0.94, I2=94%, random-effects model). However, on pooling adjusted risk estimates, the use of statin was found to significantly reduce the risk of adverse outcomes (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.63, p<0.0005, I2=0%, fixed-effects model). CONCLUSIONS: Statin use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

Stroke as a presentation has not been strongly associated with COVID-19. The authors aimed to retrospectively review a link between COVID-19 and acute stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 41 cases and 82 control subjects matched by age, sex, and risk factors. Cases were patients who underwent stroke alert imaging with confirmed acute stroke on imaging between March 16 and April 5, 2020, at 6 hospitals across New York City. Control subjects were those who underwent stroke alertimaging during the same timeframe without imaging evidence of acute infarction. Data pertaining to diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, patient demographics, and risk factors were collected. A univariate analysis was performed to assess the covariate effect of risk factors and COVID-19 status on stroke imaging with positive findings. RESULTS: The mean age for cases and controls was 65.5 ± 15.3 years and 68.8 ± 13.2 years, respectively. Of patients with acute ischemic stroke, 46.3% had COVID-19 infection compared with 18.3% of controls (P = .001). After adjusting for age, sex, and risk factors, COVID-19 infection had a significant independent association with acute ischemic stroke compared with control subjects (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.7-8.9; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that COVID-19 infection is significantly associated with imaging confirmation of acute ischemic stroke, and patients with COVID-19 should undergo more aggressive monitoring for stroke.","Belani, P; Schefflein, J; Kihira, S; Rigney, B; Delman, B N; Mahmoudi, K; Mocco, J; Majidi, S; Yeckley, J; Aggarwal, A; Lefton, D; Doshi, A H",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,,615

454968,Atypical symptoms of COVID-19 in hospitalised oldest old adults,2020,"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma has been widely used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) under the presumption that such plasma contains potentially therapeutic antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that can be passively transferred to the plasma recipient. Whether convalescent plasma with high antibody levels rather than low antibody levels is associated with a lower risk of death is unknown. METHODS: In a retrospective study based on a U.S. national registry, we determined the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels in convalescent plasma used to treat hospitalized adults with Covid-19. The primary outcome was death within 30 days after plasma transfusion. Patients who were enrolled through July 4, 2020, and for whom data on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in plasma transfusions and on 30-day mortality were available were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Of the 3082 patients included in this analysis, death within 30 days after plasma transfusion occurred in 115 of 515 patients (22.3%) in the high-titer group, 549 of 2006 patients (27.4%) in the medium-titer group, and 166 of 561 patients (29.6%) in the low-titer group. The association of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels with the risk of death from Covid-19 was moderated by mechanical ventilation status. A lower risk of death within 30 days in the high-titer group than in the low-titer group was observed among patients who had not received mechanical ventilation before transfusion (relative risk, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.91), and no effect on the risk of death was observed among patients who had received mechanical ventilation (relative risk, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.32). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized with Covid-19 who were not receiving mechanical ventilation, transfusion of plasma with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels was associated with a lower risk of death than transfusion of plasma with lower antibody levels.

To evaluate the particular impact on neurological services a rapid review was conducted. METHODS: Studies reporting the provision of neurological services during the pandemic and/or adopted mitigation strategies were included in this review. PubMed and World Health Organization's (WHO) COVID-19 database were searched. Data extraction followed categories used by WHO COVID-19 pulse surveys and operational guidelines on maintaining essential health services during COVID-19. FINDINGS: The search yielded 1101 articles, of which 369 fulfilled eligibility criteria, describing data from 210,419 participants, being adults (81%), children (11.4%) or both (7.3%). Included articles reported data from 105 countries and territories covering all WHO regions and World Bank income levels (low income: 1.9%, lower middle: 24.7%, upper middle: 29.5% and high income; 44.8%). Cross-sectoral services for neurological disorders were most frequently disrupted (62.9%), followed by emergency/acute care (47.1%). The degree of disruption was at least moderate for 75% of studies. Travel restrictions due to lockdowns (81.7%) and regulatory closure of services (65.4%) were the most commonly reported causes of disruption. Authors most frequently described telemedicine (82.1%) and novel dispensing approaches for medicines (51.8%) as mitigation strategies. Evidence for the effectiveness of these measures is largely missing. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic affects all aspects of neurological care. Given the worldwide prevalence of neurological disorders and the potential long-term neurological consequences of COVID-19, service disruptions are devastating. Different strategies such as telemedicine might mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic, but their efficacy and acceptability remain to be seen.","García-Azorín, David; Seeher, Katrin M; Newton, Charles R; Okubadejo, Njideka U; Pilotto, Andrea; Saylor, Deanna; Winkler, Andrea Sylvia; Charfi Triki, Chahnez; Leonardi, Matilde",J. neurol,,615

All studied patients tested positive for COVID-19 and had serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) results measured within 1 year prior to the date of positive tests. Medical information was retrieved from the electronic medical record and was analyzed to determine the association between vitamin D status and hospital morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Among the 287 patients, 100 (36%) were vitamin D sufficient (25[OH]D >30 ng/mL) and 41 (14%) died during hospitalization. Multivariate analysis in patients aged &#8805;65 years revealed that vitamin D sufficiency (25[OH]D &#8805;30 ng/mL) was statistically significantly associated with decreased odds of death (adjusted OR 0.33, 95% CI, 0.12-0.94), acute respiratory distress syndrome (adjusted OR 0.22, 95% CI, 0.05-0.96), and severe sepsis/septic shock (adjusted OR 0.26, 95% CI, 0.08-0.88), after adjustment for potential confounders.

Specialised codecs that rely on explicitly stored segmentations excel in this task since they preserve discontinuities between smooth regions. However, current approaches rely on ad hoc segmentations that lack a clean interpretation in terms of energy minimisation. As a remedy, we derive a generic region merging algorithm from the Mumford-Shah cartoon model. It adapts the segmentation to arbitrary reconstruction operators for the segment content.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of aPLs among critically ill patients with COVID-19. This prospective observational study included 60 patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICU). The study outcomes included prevalence of aPLs, and a primary composite outcome of all-cause mortality and arterial or venous thrombosis between antiphospholipid-positive and antiphospholipid-negative patients during their ICU stay. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the influence of aPLs on the primary composite outcome of mortality and thrombosis. A total of 60 critically ill patients were enrolled. Among them, 57 (95%) were men, with a mean age of 52.8 ± 12.2 years, and the majority were from Asia (68%).

The composite outcome of mortality and thrombosis during their ICU stay did not differ between antiphospholipid-positive and antiphospholipid-negative patients (4 [18%] vs. 6 [16%], adjusted odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.1-6.7; p value = 0.986). The presence of aPLs does not seem to affect the outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in terms of all-cause mortality and thrombosis. Therefore, clinicians may not screen critically ill patients with COVID-19 for aPLs unless deemed clinically appropriate.","Najim, Mostafa; Rahhal, Alaa; Khir, Fadi; Aljundi, Amer Hussien; Abu Yousef, Safae; Ibrahim, Feryal; Amer, Aliaa; Mohamed, Ahmed S; Saleh, Samira; Alfaridi, Dekra; Mahfouz, Ahmed; Alyafei, Sumaya; Howady, Faraj; Khatib, Mohamad; Alemadi, Samar A",Rheumatol Int,,615

Since the spread of COVID-19, suggestions were provided to juvenile justice bodies, encouraging a reduction of youth arrests, detainments, and quicker court processing. Yet, the research comparing peri-COVID-19 changes for girls and boys is lacking, with an oversight to gender trends and rural and urban differences. This study used Juvenile Intake and Assessment Center (JIAC) data from a rural Midwestern state to look at rural and urban location trends for both boys and girls. Results suggest rural communities are responding differently to girls? behaviors, revealing a slower decline in intakes compared to boys and youth in urban areas.","Terry, April N.; Lockwood, Ashley Steele Morgan Milner Megan",Crime &amp; Delinquency,,615
465577,Desafios e Recomendações à Atenção Oncológica durante a Pandemia da Covid-19,2020,"Purpose The COVID-19 virus pandemic has strongly influenced consumer behaviour worldwide. This paper aims to investigate how risk perceptions and precautions related to COVID-19 virus influence consumer eating habits and consequently, behaviour during shopping for food. Also, research tends to identify changes in consumer eating habits resulting from the current pandemic situation. Design/methodology/approach In total, 237 consumers from Serbia were online surveyed during November 2020. Starting from the methodology of the SOR model (Mehrabian and Russell, 1974), the questionnaire consists of seven-point Likert scale statements that measure risk perceptions and precautions as stimulus (S), eating habits as an organism (O) and food choice, precautions during shopping for food and food purchasing patterns as a response (S). Findings Research results confirm the difference in consumers' eating habits during and before a pandemic. Also, results indicate that perceived risk and precautions related to the COVID-19 virus have a statistically significant influence on consumers' eating habits which have changed during a pandemic, finally resulting in significant effects on consumers' food shopping behaviour. Research limitations/implications The main limitations of this study are observing only a few aspects related to COVID-19 virus pandemic and consumer food shopping behaviour, as well as measuring precautions, perceived risk and food shopping behaviour at one point in time besides the fact that pandemic situation constantly changes. Originality/value The study indicates that food manufacturers should pay attention to the consumers' eating habits and food shopping behaviour changes under the circumstances of COVID-19 virus pandemic. Identified changes can be used as opportunities to gain a competitive advantage on the market.","Marinkovic, V.; Lazarevic, J.",British Food Journal,,615

The omnipresence of smart Internet-of-things (IoT) devices can play a predominant role in designing advanced techniques helping in minimizing the risk of contamination. In this paper, we propose a practical framework that uses the Social IoT (SIoT) concept to improve pedestrians safely navigate through a real-wold map of a smart city. The objective is to mitigate the risks of exposure to the virus in high-dense areas where social distancing might not be well-practiced. The proposed routing approach recommends pedestrians' route in a real-time manner while considering other devices' mobility. First, the IoT devices are clustered into communities according to two SIoT relations that consider the devices' locations and the friendship levels among their owners. Accordingly, the city map roads are assigned weights representing their safety levels. Afterward, a navigation algorithm, namely the Dijkstra algorithm, is applied to recommend the safest route to follow. Simulation results applied on a real-world IoT data set have shown the ability of the proposed approach in achieving trade-offs between both safest and shortest paths according to the pedestrian preference.","Khanfor, Abdullah; Friji, Hamdi; Ghazzai, Hakim; Massoud, Yehia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09539v1.pdf,615

Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among a sample of 309 Israeli Jewish persons aged 40 and above. Results: Overall, almost three quarters (71%) of the participants chose the 80-year-old patient with a diagnosis of AD to be the last to be provided with a ventilator. The preferences of the remaining quarter were divided between the 80-year-old person who was cognitively intact and the 55-year-old person with AD. Education and subjective knowledge about AD were significantly associated with participants' preferences. Conclusion: Our results suggest that cognitive status might not be a strong discriminating factor for laypersons' preferences for allocating ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Werner, Perla; Landau, Ruth",Clin Interv Aging,,615

Here, we report the results of a randomised trial to assess whether lopinavir-ritonavir improves outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial, a range of possible treatments was compared with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. The trial is underway at 176 hospitals in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) by mouth for 10 days or until discharge (or one of the other RECOVERY treatment groups: hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, or azithromycin) using web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment. Randomisation to usual care was twice that of any of the active treatment groups (eg, 2:1 in favour of usual care if the patient was eligible for only one active group, 2:1:1 if the patient was eligible for two active groups). The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis in all randomly assigned participants. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936. FINDINGS: Between March 19, 2020, and June 29, 2020, 1616 patients were randomly allocated to receive lopinavir-ritonavir and 3424 patients to receive usual care. Overall, 374 (23%) patients allocated to lopinavir-ritonavir and 767 (22%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 1·03, 95% CI 0·91-1·17; p=0·60). Results were consistent across all prespecified subgroups of patients. We observed no significant difference in time until discharge alive from hospital (median 11 days [IQR 5 to >28] in both groups) or the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (rate ratio 0·98, 95% CI 0·91-1·05; p=0·53). Among patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in the proportion who met the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (risk ratio 1·09, 95% CI 0·99-1·20; p=0·092). INTERPRETATION: In patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death. These findings do not support the use of lopinavir-ritonavir for treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

It has since been recognized as a pandemic and has led to great social and economic disruption globally. The Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtRT-PCR) has become the primary method for COVID-19 testing worldwide. The method requires a specialized laboratory set up. Long-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal secretion after full clinical recovery of the patient is regularly observed nowadays. This forces the patients to spend a longer period in isolation and test repeatedly to obtain evidence of viral clearance. Repeated COVID-19 testing in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases often leads to extra workload for laboratories that are already struggling with a high specimen turnover. Here, we present 5 purposively selected cases with different patterns of clinical presentations in which nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in patients for a long time. From these case studies, we emphasized the adoption of a symptom-based approach for discontinuing transmission-based precautions over a test-based strategy to reduce the time spent by asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients in isolation. A symptom-based approach will also help reduce laboratory burden for COVID-19 testing as well as conserve valuable resources and supplies utilized for rtRT-PCR testing in an emerging lower-middle-income setting. Most importantly, it will also make room for critically ill COVID-19 patients to visit or avail COVID-19 testing at their convenience.","Islam, S M Rashed Ul; Akther, Tahmina; Nasif, Md Abdullah Omar; Sultana, Sharmin; Munshi, Saif Ullah",J Prim Care Community Health,,615

It primarily affects the respiratory tract and lungs in some cases causing severe organ damage and pneumonia due to overwhelming immune responses. Clinical reports show that the most commons symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath, along with several other symptoms. It is thought that an immense cytokine dysregulation in COVID-19 patients is caused following the virus infection. Notably, if patients present with pre-existing specific comorbidities like diabetes or high blood pressure, rates of COVID-19 induced complications and deaths are escalated. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has been shown to alleviate pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) symptoms, through their immunomodulatory activities in COVID-19 patients. Although more research studies and clinical trial results are needed to elucidate the exact mechanism by which MSCs provide relief to COVID-19 infected patients. Results from clinical trials are encouraging as patients treated with MSCs, regain lung functions and have restored levels of cytokines and trophic factors underscoring the fact that stem cell therapy can be, at least, a complementary therapy to alleviate sufferings in COVID-19 patients. This review discusses the possible therapeutic uses of MSCs for treating COVID-19.

This study presents the potential and ability of Twitter in tracking early detection of COVID-19, monitoring the dissemination of information, and exploration of public awareness and attitudes among Nigerians. Tweets mentioning COVID-19 and related keywords were collected in 11 batches via the NCapture™ plugin available on Google Chrome from February 20 - May 6, 2020. The analysis includes a time series analysis to track the distribution of data and content analysis to analyze the knowledge and attitudes of Nigerians. A total of 67,989 tweets (1,484 unique and 66,505 retweets) citing COVID-19 and related keywords were returned. The Tweets started to emerge earlier to the first confirmed case in Nigeria while maintaining a dangling-upward movement up to the 11th week under study. Matters arising from the tweets include a dearth of information on COVID-19 and optimism among others. The results provide insight into the intersection of SNSs and public health surveillance. Results show how helpful Twitter is to educate education in public health. Health organizations and the government may benefit from paying attention to both amusing and emotional contents from the Twitter community to formulate a viable policy for treatment and control.","Adebisi, Tunde Aregbesola Ayooluwa Asamu Festus Arisukwu Ogadimma Oyeyipo Eyitayo",Heliyon,,615

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to moderate fever (<39.1â¯°C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis. CONCLUSION: CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved. CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment of NCP.","Xu, Yu-Huan; Dong, Jing-Hui; An, Wei-Min; Lv, Xiao-Yan; Yin, Xiao-Ping; Zhang, Jian-Zeng; Dong, Li; Ma, Xi; Zhang, Hong-Jie; Gao, Bu-Lang",J Infect,,615

Therefore, the aim of this study described here was to develop and validate novel SARS-CoV-2 proteins binding human mRNAs (SPBRs) signature to predict overall survival (OS) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, a set of SPBRs was identified to establish a multigene signature in the Cancer Genome Atlas repositories cohort. Furthermore, a nomogram was established based on the signature and clinical risk factors to improve risk stratification for individual patients. External validation was performed in the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) cohort. A six-SPBR signature was built to classify patients into two risk groups using a risk score with different OS in two cohorts (all p < 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated the signature was an independent predictor of HCC. Moreover, the signature presented an excellent diagnostic power in differentiating HCC and normal tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that high-risk group was closely enriched in cell cycle, DNA replication, microRNAs in cancer, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. The novel signature demonstrated great clinical value in predicting the OS for patients with HCC, and will provide a good reference between cancer research and SARS-CoV-2 and help individualized treatment in HCC.","Chen, Shimin",DNA cell biol,,615

It is the most dangerous epidemic existing currently all over the world. To date, there is no licensed vaccine and not any particular efficient therapeutic agent available to prevent or cure the disease. So development of an effective vaccine is the urgent need of the time. The proposed study aims to identify potential vaccine candidates by screening the complete proteome of SARS-COV-2 using the computational approach. From 14 protein entries in UniProtKB, 4 proteins were screened for epitope prediction based on consensus antigenicity predictions and various physico-chemical criteria like transmembrane domain, allergenicity, GRAVY value, toxicity, stability index. Comprehensive analysis of these 4 antigens revealed that spike protein (P0DTC2) and nucleoprotein (P0DTC9) show the greatest potential for experimental immunogenicity analysis. These 2 proteins have several potential CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell epitopes, as well as high probability of B-cell epitope regions as compared to well-characterized antigen the matrix protein 1 [Influenza A virus (H5N1)]. In addition, the epitope SIIAYTMSL predicted from spike protein (P0DTC2) and epitope SPRWYFYYL predicted from nucleoprotein (P0DTC9) exhibited more than 60% population coverage in the target populations Europe, North America, South Asia, Northeast Asia taken in this study. These epitopes have also been found to exhibit highly significant TCR-pMHC interactions having a joint Z value of 4.51 and 4.37 respectively. Therefore, this analysis suggests that the predicted epitopes might be suitable vaccine candidates and should be subjected to further in-vivo and in-vitro studies.","Jain, Richa; Jain, Ankit; Verma, Santosh Kumar",Int J Pept Res Ther,,615

This paper reviews the possibility of repurposing angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists and vitamin D to treat COVID-19. ACE2 protein found on the cell membranes is the target of SARS-CoV-2 for entering into the host cells. Viral spike protein-binding with ACE2 down-regulates it. As ACE2 is known to protect the lung from injuries, SARS-CoV-2-induced ACE2 deficiency may expose patients to lung damage. AT1R antagonists and vitamin D increase the expression of ACE2 independently. Besides, vitamin D suppresses the compensatory increase in renin levels following the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by AT1R antagonists. Therefore, a combination of AT1R antagonists and vitamin D may offer protection against COVID-19 induced lung injury.","Rafiullah, Mohamed",Am J Med Sci,,615

For telehealth to be effective as part of an emergency response it first needs to become a routinely used part of our health system. Hence, it is time to step back and ask why telehealth is not mainstreamed. In this article, we highlight key requirements for this to occur. Strategies to ensure that telehealth is used regularly in acute, post-acute and emergency situations, alongside conventional service delivery methods, include flexible funding arrangements, training and accrediting our health workforce. Telehealth uptake also requires a significant change in management effort and the redesign of existing models of care.

We assessed the consumption of 20 food groups during the previous 7 days. The dietary diversity scores (DDS) and Prime Diet Quality Scores (PDQS) were used to assess dietary diversity and quality. We used generalized estimating equation (GEE) linear models to evaluate associations between price changes for staples, pulses, vegetables, fruits, and animal source foods (ASFs) with the DDS and PDQS PDQS. Most participants reported increasing prices of staples, pulses, fruits, vegetables and ASF, and &#8805; 40% reported the decreased consumption of staples, legumes, and other vegetables and fruits. The DDS (except in Kersa and Ouagadougou) and PDQS were lower during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Given the significant global demand to provide telehealth services, it is important to explore patient receptiveness toward this alternative service model, particularly from regions where it has yet to be implemented. We conducted a cross-sectional study to understand the views and willingness of patients toward the use of telehealth for cancer genetic counseling. A survey was completed by 160 patients of the National Cancer Centre Singapore, and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. The study found that 95.6% (n = 153/160) of participants did not have prior telehealth experience. Most participants were willing or neutral toward having genetic counseling by phone (n = 114/160, 71.3%) and video (n = 106/160, 66.3%). However, majority prefer in-person appointments for first (n = 127/160, 79.4%) and follow-up (n = 97/160, 60.6%) visits over telehealth. Majority agreed that a phone/video consultation would meet most of their needs but voiced concerns regarding privacy and sharing of information (n = 79/160, 49.4% for phone; n = 74/160, 46.3% for video) and whether their emotional needs could be met (n = 61/160, 38.1%). Participants' age, employment status, income, mode of transportation to the appointment, and whether special arrangements were made to attend the in-person appointment were associated with receptivity to telehealth genetic counseling (p &#8804; .05 for all). This study adds diversity to existing literature and demonstrates that patients from Asia are generally willing and accepting of the use of telehealth in a cancer genetics service. This will help meet increasing global demand of telehealth consultations in the post-pandemic new norm. Furthermore, it will also provide services for underserved populations and patients requiring urgent testing in a timely manner. Further studies are needed to explore the cost-effectiveness and fair billing methods, as well as willingness and acceptability of telehealth genetic counseling in post-COVID times.","Sim, Jackie; Shaw, Tarryn; Li, Shao-Tzu; Courtney, Eliza; Yuen, Jeanette; Chiang, Jianbang; Nazir, Maryam; Tan, Ryan; Ngeow, Joanne",J. genet. couns,,615

According to several observations, agitation prevalence ranges from 30 to 50% in Alzheimer's disease, 30% in dementia with Lewy bodies, 40% in frontotemporal dementia, and 40% in vascular dementia (VaD). With an overall prevalence of about 30%, agitation is the third most common neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia, after apathy and depression, and it is even more frequent (80%) in residents of nursing homes. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying agitation is represented by a frontal lobe dysfunction, mostly involving the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), respectively, meaningful in selecting the salient stimuli and subsequent decision-making and behavioral reactions. Furthermore, increased sensitivity to noradrenergic signaling has been observed, possibly due to a frontal lobe up-regulation of adrenergic receptors, as a reaction to the depletion of noradrenergic neurons within the locus coeruleus (LC). Indeed, LC neurons mainly project toward the OFC and ACC. These observations may explain the abnormal reactivity to weak stimuli and the global arousal found in many patients who have dementia. Furthermore, agitation can be precipitated by several factors, e.g., the sunset or low lighted environments as in the sundown syndrome, hospitalization, the admission to nursing residencies, or changes in pharmacological regimens. In recent days, the global pandemic has increased agitation incidence among dementia patients and generated higher distress levels in patients and caregivers. Hence, given the increasing presence of this condition and its related burden on society and the health system, the present point of view aims at providing an extensive guide to facilitate the identification, prevention, and management of acute and chronic agitation in dementia patients.","Carrarini, C.; Russo, M.; Dono, F.; Barbone, F.; Rispoli, M.

The longevity of the crisis, and disruption to normality is unknown. With COVID-19 set to be a chronic health crisis, clinicians will be required to maintain a state of high alert for an extended period. The support received before and during an incident is likely to influence whether clinicians experience psychological growth or injury. An abundance of information is emerging on disease epidemiology, pathogenesis and infection control prevention. However, literature on interventions for supporting the psychological wellbeing of healthcare workers during disease outbreaks is limited. This article summarises the available management strategies to increase resilience in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. It focuses on self care and organisational justice. It highlights various individual as well as organisational strategies. With the success of slowing disease spread in many countries to date, and reduced workload due to limitations on elective surgery in many institutions, there is more time and opportunity to be proactive in implementing measures to mitigate or minimise potential adverse psychological effects and improve, restore and preserve the wellbeing of the workforce now and for years to come. The purpose of this review is to review available literature on strategies for minimising the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinicians and to identify proactive holistic approaches which may be beneficial for healthcare workers both for the current crisis and into the future.","Heath, C; Sommerfield, A; von Ungern-Sternberg, B S",Anaesthesia (Lond.),,615

A rapid review and meta-analysis were conducted to synthesize evidence assessing the effectiveness of COVID-19 IPC measures implemented in global workplace settings through April 2021. Medline, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies that quantitatively assessed the effectiveness of workplace COVID-19 IPC measures. The included studies comprised varying empirical designs and occupational settings. Measures of interest included surveillance measures, outbreak investigations, environmental adjustments, personal protective equipment (PPE), changes in work arrangements, and worker education. Sixty-one studies from healthcare, nursing home, meatpacking, manufacturing, and office settings were included, accounting for ~280,000 employees based in Europe, Asia, and North America. Meta-analyses showed that combined IPC measures resulted in lower employee COVID-19 positivity rates (0.2% positivity; 95% CI 0–0.4%) than single measures such as asymptomatic PCR testing (1.7%; 95% CI 0.9–2.9%) and universal masking (24%; 95% CI 3.4–55.5%). Modelling studies showed that combinations of (i) timely and widespread contact tracing and case isolation, (ii) facilitating smaller worker cohorts, and (iii) effective use of PPE can reduce workplace transmission. Comprehensive COVID-19 IPC measures incorporating swift contact tracing and case isolation, PPE, and facility zoning can effectively prevent workplace outbreaks.

599401,Tales of precarity: A reflexive essay on experiencing the COVID pandemic as a social work educator on a precarious contract,2021-03-11,"Following the onset of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world, a large fraction of the global population is or has been under strict measures of physical distancing and quarantine, with many countries being in partial or full lockdown. These measures are imposed in order to reduce the spread of the disease and to lift the pressure on healthcare systems. Estimating the impact of such interventions as well as monitoring the gradual relaxing of these stringent measures is quintessential to understand how resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic can be controlled for in the future. In this paper we use a stochastic age-structured discrete time compartmental model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in Belgium. Our model explicitly accounts for age-structure by integrating data on social contacts to (i) assess the impact of the lockdown as implemented on March 13, 2020 on the number of new hospitalizations in Belgium; (ii) conduct a scenario analysis estimating the impact of possible exit strategies on potential future COVID-19 waves. More specifically, the aforementioned model is fitted to hospital admission data, data on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths and serial serological survey data informing the (sero)prevalence of the disease in the population while relying on a Bayesian MCMC approach. Our age-structured stochastic model describes the observed outbreak data well, both in terms of hospitalizations as well as COVID-19 related deaths in the Belgian population. Despite an extensive exploration of various projections for the future course of the epidemic, based on the impact of adherence to measures of physical distancing and a potential increase in contacts as a result of the relaxation of the stringent lockdown measures, a lot of uncertainty remains about the evolution of the epidemic in the next months.","Abrams, Steven; Wambua, James; Santermans, Eva; Willem, Lander; Kuylen, Elise; Coletti, Pietro; Libin, Pieter; Faes, Christel; Petrof, Oana; Herzog, Sereina A.; Beutels, Philippe; Hens, Niel",Epidemics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33799289/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755436521000116; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2021.100449; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436521000116?v=s5,615

We implemented a ""care map"", as a standardized multidisciplinary approach to improve patients monitoring using: uniform patient selection for ICU admission, a low-PEEP strategy and a pharmacologic strategic thromboembolism management. Methods A standardized protocol for managing COVID-19 patients and ICU admissions was implemented through accurate Early Warning Score (EWS) monitoring and thromboembolism prophylaxis at hospital admission. Dyspnea, mental confusion or SpO2 less than 85% were criteria for ICU admission. Ventilation approach employed low PEEP values (about 10 cmH2O in presence of lung compliance > 40 mL/cmH2O) and FiO2 as needed. In presence of lower lung compliance (< 40 mL/cmH2O) PEEP value was increased to about 14 cmH2O. Results From March 16th to April 12nd 2020, 41 COVID-19 patients were admitted to our ICU from a total of 310 patients. 83% (34) of them needed mechanical ventilation. The ventilation approach chosen employed low PEEP value based on BMI (PEEP 11+/- 3.8 (10-12) cmH2O if BMI < 30 Kg/m2; PEEP 15+/- 3.26 (12-18) cmH2O if BMI >30 Kg/m2). To date, ten patients (24%) died, four (9.7%) received mechanical ventilation, two were transferred to another hospital and 25 (60.9%) were discharged from ICU after a median of nine days. Discussion A multimodal approach for COVID-19 patients is mandatory. The knowledge of this multi-organ disease is growing rapidly, requiring improvements in the standard of care. Our approach implements an accurate pre-ICU monitoring and strict selection for ICU admission, and allows to reduce mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and mortality.

607231,Uso do decúbito ventral para o manejo de pacientes com COVID-19 hospitalizados em enfermaria,2020-05-14,"INTRODUCTION: Gut microbiota has been reported to contribute to obesity and the pathology of obesity‐related diseases but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Mucosal‐associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a unique subpopulation of T cells characterized by the expression of a semi‐invariant T cell receptor (TCR) α chain (Vα19 in mice; Vα7.2 in humans). The expansion and maturation of MAIT cells require the gut microbiota and antigen‐presenting molecule MR1, suggesting that MAIT cells may play a unique role in bridging gut microbiota, obesity, and obesity‐associated inflammation. METHODS: The levels of human MAIT cells from obese patients, as well as mouse MAIT cells from obese mouse models, were determined by flow cytometry. By comparing to controls, we analyzed the change of MAIT cells in obese subjects. RESULTS: We found obese patients had fewer circulating MAIT cells than healthy‐weight donors and the difference was more distinct in male patients. Consistently, male mice (but not female mice) have shown reduced MAIT cells in the liver and adipose tissue after a 10‐week Western diet compared to mice on a control diet. We also explored the possibility of utilizing high‐throughput technology (i.e., quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]), other than flow cytometry, to determine the expression levels of the invariant TCR of human MAIT cells. But a minimal correlation (R (2) = 0.23, p = .11) was observed between qPCR and flow cytometry data. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that there is a sex discrepancy in the impact of obesity on MAIT cells: MAIT cells in male (but not female) humans and male mice are reduced by obesity.","Liu, Jianyun; Nan, Hongmei; Brutkiewicz, Randy R; Casasnovas, Jose; Kua, Kok Lim",Immun Inflamm Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33332759/; https://doi.org/10.1002/iid3.393,615
609401,Preventing Violent Extremism and Social Work: Recent US History and Prospects,2021-07-01,"This study was conducted to detect and characterize enteric viruses [rotavirus, turkey astrovirus-2 (TAstV-2), reovirus, and turkey coronavirus] from cases of poult enteritis syndrome (PES) in Minnesota turkeys. Of the intestinal contents collected from 43 PES cases, 25 were positive for rotavirus and 13 for small round viruses by electron microscopy (EM). Of the enteric virus-positive cases by EM (n = 27), 16 cases had rotavirus or small round viruses alone and the remaining 11 cases had both viruses. None of the cases were positive for reovirus or coronavirus by EM. However, with reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), 40 cases (93%) were positive for rotavirus, 36 (84%) for TAstV-2, and 17 (40%) for reovirus. None of the cases were positive for turkey coronavirus by RT-PCR. The viruses from all cases were detected either alone or in combination of 2 or 3 by RT-PCR. Thus, 8 (19%) cases were positive for a single virus, whereas a combination of viruses was detected in the remaining 35 (81%) cases. The rota-TAstV-2 combination was the most predominant (n = 18 cases). Fifteen cases were positive for all 3 viruses. The rotaviruses had sequence homology of 89.8 to 100% with previously published sequences of turkey rotaviruses at the nucleotide level. The TAstV-2 had sequence homology of 84.6 to 98.7% with previously published TAstV-2, whereas reoviruses had sequence homology of 91.6 to 99.3% with previously published sequences of turkey reoviruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that rota- and reoviruses clustered in a single group, whereas TAstV-2 clustered in 2 different groups. In conclusion, a larger number of PES cases was positive for rotavirus, TAstV-2, and reovirus by RT-PCR than with EM. The presence of more than one virus and changes at the genetic level in a virus may affect the severity of PES in turkey flocks.","Jindal, N.; Patnayak, D. P.; Chander, Y.; Ziegler, A. F.; Goyal, S.

609730,"Benefits, barriers, and incentives for improved resilience to disruption in university teaching",2020-05-29,"The emergence of neurotropic Zika virus (ZIKV) raised a public health emergency of global concern. ZIKV can cross the placental barrier and infect foetal brains, resulting in microcephaly, but the pathogenesis of ZIKV is poorly understood. With recent findings reporting AXL as a type I interferon antagonist rather than an entry receptor, the exact entry mechanism remains unresolved. Here we report that cell surface sialic acid plays an important role in ZIKV infection. Removal of cell surface sialic acid by neuraminidase significantly abolished ZIKV infection in Vero cells and human induced-pluripotent stem cells-derived neural progenitor cells. Furthermore, knockout of the sialic acid biosynthesis gene encoding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase resulted in significantly less ZIKV infection of both African and Asian lineages. Huh7 cells deficient in α2,3-linked sialic acid through knockout of ST3 β-galactoside-α2,3-sialyltransferase 4 had significantly reduced ZIKV infection. Removal of membrane-bound, un-internalized virus with pronase treatment revealed the role of sialic acid in ZIKV internalization but not attachment. Sialyllactose inhibition studies showed that there is no direct interaction between sialic acid and ZIKV, implying that sialic acid could be mediating ZIKV-receptor complex internalization. Identification of α2,3-linked sialic acid as an important host factor for ZIKV internalization provides new insight into ZIKV infection and pathogenesis.","Tan, Chee Wah; Huan Hor, Catherine Hong; Kwek, Swee Sen; Tee, Han Kang; Sam, I-Ching; Goh, Eyleen L.

Methods: A total of five patients in Nissan Tamagawa Hospital, Tokyo, Japan confirmed COVID-19 from August 8, 2020 to August 14, 2020 were investigated. Serum samples were acquired multiple times from 0 to 76 days after symptom onset. Using a fully automated CLIA analyzer, we measured the levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 N, S1, and RBD and NAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Results: The levels of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins increased over time in all cases but IgM and IgA levels against SARS-CoV-2 showed different increasing trends among individuals in the early stage. In particular, we observed IgA antibodies increasing before IgG and IgM in 3/5 cases. The NAb levels against SARS-CoV-2 increased and kept above 10 AU/mL more than around 70 days after symptom onset in all cases. Furthermore, in the early stage, NAb levels were more than cut off value in 4/5 COVID-19 patients some of whose antibodies against RBD didn't exceed 10 AU/mL. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that patients with COVID-19 should be examined for IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in addition to conventional antibody testing methods for SARS-CoV-2 (IgG and IgM kits) to analyze the diversity of patients' immune mechanisms.","Kaneko, Y.; Sugiyama, A.; Tanaka, T.; Fukui, K.; Taguchi, A.; Nakayama, A.; Koga, K.; Kishi, Y.; Daming, W.; Qian, C.; Xia, F.; He, F.; Zheng, L.; Yu, Y.; Wada, Y.; Kodama, T.; Kawamura, T.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.17.21258858; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.21258858v1?rss=1,615

Owing to the importance of cellular ACE2 and heparan sulfate in SARS-CoV-2 entry, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cationic G1 and G2 peptides in virus entry inhibition. In silico binding affinity studies revealed possible binding sites of G1 and G2 peptides on HS and ACE2, which are required for the spike–HS and spike–ACE2 interactions. Prophylactic treatment of G1 and G2 peptide was also proved to decrease the cell surface HS, an essential virus entry receptor.

OBJECTIVES: To understand the response of and challenges faced by palliative care services during the COVID-19 pandemic, and identify associated factors. METHODS: We surveyed palliative care and hospice services, contacted via relevant organisations. Multivariable logistic regression identified associations with challenges. Content analysis explored free text responses. RESULTS: 458 services responded; 277 UK, 85 rest of Europe, 95 rest of the world; 81% cared for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, 77% had staff with suspected or confirmed COVID-19; 48% reported shortages of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 40% staff shortages, 24% medicines shortages, 14% shortages of other equipment. Services provided direct care and education in symptom management and communication; 91% changed how they worked. Care often shifted to increased community and hospital care, with fewer admissions to inpatient palliative care units. Factors associated with increased odds of PPE shortages were: charity rather than public management (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.81-5.20), inpatient palliative care unit rather than other settings (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.46-3.75). Being outside the UK was associated with lower odds of staff shortages (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.76). Staff described increased workload, concerns for their colleagues who were ill, whilst expending time struggling to get essential equipment and medicines, perceiving they were not a front-line service.

The contemporaneous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 ‘variants of concern’ (VOC) across diverse geographic locales underscores the need to monitor the efficacy of vaccines being administered globally. All WHO designated VOC carry spike (S) polymorphisms thought to enable escape from neutralizing antibodies.

OBJECTIVE: Our objectives for this study were to (1) evaluate the effectiveness and cost of using social media news feed advertisements, a clinic-based approach method, and web-based snowball sampling to reach inadequately active adults with T1D and (2) compare characteristics of enrollees against normative data. METHODS: Participants were recruited between November 2019 and August 2020. In method #1, Facebook and Instagram news feed advertisements ran for five 1-to-8-day windows targeting adults (18 to 64 years old) in the greater New Haven and Hartford, Connecticut, areas with one or more diabetes-related profile interest. If interested, participants completed a webform so that the research team could contact them for eligibility screening. In method #2, patients 18 to 24 years old with T1D were approached in person at clinical visits in November and December 2019. Those who were interested immediately completed eligibility screening. Older patients could not be approached due to clinic restrictions. In method #3, snowball sampling was conducted by physically active individuals with T1D contacting their peers on Facebook and via email for 48 days, with details to contact the research staff to express interest and complete eligibility screening. Other methods referred participants to the study similarly to snowball sampling. RESULTS: In method #1, advertisements were displayed to 11,738 unique viewers and attracted 274 clickers (2.33%); 20 participants from this group (7.3%) volunteered, of whom 8 (40%) were eligible. Costs averaged US $1.20 per click and US $95.88 per eligible volunteer. Men had lower click rates than women (1.71% vs 3.17%; P<.001), but their responsiveness and eligibility rates did not differ. In method #2, we approached 40 patients; 32 of these patients (80%) inquired about the study, of whom 20 (63%) volunteered, and 2 of these volunteers (10%) were eligible. Costs including personnel for in-person approaches averaged US $21.01 per inquirer and US $479.79 per eligible volunteer. In method #3, snowball sampling generated 13 inquirers; 12 of these inquirers (92%) volunteered, of whom 8 (67%) were eligible. Incremental costs to attract inquirers were negligible, and total costs averaged US $20.59 per eligible volunteer. Other methods yielded 7 inquirers; 5 of these inquirers (71%) volunteered, of whom 2 (40%) were eligible. Incremental costs to attract inquirers were negligible, and total costs averaged US $34.94 per eligible volunteer. Demographic overrepresentations emerged in the overall cohort (ie, optimal glycemic control, obesity, and low exercise), among those recruited by news feed advertisements (ie, obesity and older age), and among those recruited by snowball sampling (ie, optimal glycemic control and low exercise). CONCLUSIONS: Web-based advertising and recruitment strategies are a promising means to attract adults with T1D to clinical trials and exercise interventions, with costs comparing favorably to prior trials despite targeting an uncommon condition (ie, T1D) and commitment to an intervention. These strategies should be tailored in future studies to increase access to higher-risk participants.

Taking consideration of the importance of PEDV orf3 gene, we have performed comprehensive analysis to investigate its synonymous codon usage patterns. In this study, the results of base composition analysis showed A/T rich and G/C poor in PEDV orf3 genes, and the most abundant base was nucleotide T. The relative synonymous codon usage value in each codon revealed that codon usage bias existed. The mean ENC value of each gene was 48.75, indicating a low codon usage bias, as well as a relatively instable change in PEDV orf3 genes. The general correlation analysis between base composition and codon usage bias indicated that mutational bias has an impact on the PEDV codon usage bias. Neutral analysis suggested that natural selection pressure takes a more important influence than mutational bias in shaping codon usage bias. Moreover, other factors including hydrophobicity and aromaticity have been also found to influence the codon usage variation among the PEDV orf3 genes. This study not only represents the most systematic analysis of codon usage patterns in PEDV orf3 genes, but also provides a basic shaping mechanism of the codon usage bias.","Xu, Xin; Li, Pengfei; Zhang, Yating; Wang, Xianhe; Xu, Jiaxin; Wu, Xuening; Shen, Yujiang; Guo, Dexuan; Li, Yuchang; Yao, Lili; Li, Liyang; Song, Baifen; Ma, Jinzhu; Liu, Xinyang; Xu, Shuyan; Zhang, Hua; Wu, Zhijun; Cao, Hongwei",Research in Veterinary Science,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528819302322; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528819302322; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2019.09.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677415/,615

The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. METHODS: A total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed. RESULTS: Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately. The presence of antibodies was <40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p<0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, Juanjuan; Yuan, Quan; Wang, Haiyan; Liu, Wei; Liao, Xuejiao; Su, Yingying; Wang, Xin; Yuan, Jing; Li, Tingdong; Li, Jinxiu; Qian, Shen; Hong, Congming; Wang, Fuxiang; Liu, Yingxia; Wang, Zhaoqin; He, Qing; Li, Zhiyong; He, Bin; Zhang, Tianying; Fu, Yang; Ge, Shengxiang; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Jun; Xia, Ningshao; Zhang, Zheng",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32221519/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa344,615
643409,Managing older adults’ fear of coronavirus disease: A new role for social work practice,2021-03-11,"The Greater Accra Region is the smallest of the 16 administrative regions in Ghana. It is highly populated and characterized by tropical climatic conditions. Although efforts towards malaria control in Ghana have had positive impacts, malaria remains in the top five diseases reported at healthcare facilities within the Greater Accra Region. To further accelerate progress, analysis of regionally generated data is needed to inform control and management measures at this level. This study aimed to examine the climatic drivers of malaria transmission in the Greater Accra Region and identify inter-district variation in malaria burden. Monthly malaria cases for the Greater Accra Region were obtained from the Ghanaian District Health Information and Management System. Malaria cases were decomposed using seasonal-trend decomposition, based on locally weighted regression to analyze seasonality. A negative binomial regression model with a conditional autoregressive prior structure was used to quantify associations between climatic variables and malaria risk and spatial dependence. Posterior parameters were estimated using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with Gibbs sampling. A total of 1,105,370 malaria cases were recorded in the region from 2015 to 2019. The overall malaria incidence for the region was approximately 47 per 1000 population. Malaria transmission was highly seasonal with an irregular inter-annual pattern. Monthly malaria case incidence was found to decrease by 2.3% (95% credible interval: 0.7–4.2%) for each 1 °C increase in monthly minimum temperature. Only five districts located in the south-central part of the region had a malaria incidence rate lower than the regional average at >95% probability level. The distribution of malaria cases was heterogeneous, seasonal, and significantly associated with climatic variables. Targeted malaria control and prevention in high-risk districts at the appropriate time points could result in a significant reduction in malaria transmission in the Greater Accra Region.","Donkor, Elorm; Kelly, Matthew; Eliason, Cecilia; Amotoh, Charles; Gray, Darren J.; Clements, Archie C.

645620,Dolor neuropático y COVID-19: Una relación silente,2021-09-24,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease related mortality is the leading cause of death in the United States, with hypertension being the most prevalent and potent risk factor. For decades hypertension has disproportionately affected African Americans, who also have a higher burden of associated comorbidities including diabetes and heart failure. METHODS: Current literature including guideline reports and newer studies on hypertension in African Americans in PubMed were reviewed. We also reviewed newer publications on the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. FINDINGS: While APOL1 has been theorized in the epidemiology of hypertension, the increased prevalence and associated risks are primarily due to environmental and lifestyle factors. These factors include poor diet, adverse lifestyle, and social determinants. Hypertension control can be achieved by lifestyle modifications such as low sodium diet, weight loss, and adequate physical activity. When lifestyle modifications alone do not adequately control hypertension, a common occurrence among African Americans who suffer with greater prevalence of resistant hypertension, pharmacological intervention is indicated. The efficacy of renal denervation, and the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 and aminopeptidase A inhibitors, have been studied for treatment of resistant hypertension. Furthermore, the recent COVID-19 crisis has been particularly devastating among African Americans who demonstrate increased incidence and poorer health outcomes related to the disease. CONCLUSION: The disparities in outcomes, which are largely attributable to a greater prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension and obesity, in addition to adverse environmental and socioeconomic factors, highlight the necessity of specialized clinical approaches and programs for African Americans to address longstanding barriers to equitable care.","Ferdinand, Keith; Batieste, Tivona; Fleurestil, Mashli",J Natl Med Assoc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0027968420301176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32563685/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2020.05.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0027968420301176,615

[Letter],2021-09-21,"PCR Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism is a method used to identify and detect mutations and is now well known for its many applications on living beings. This paper will discuss the experimental details, limitations and sensitivity of the PCR Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism method in relation to all existing literature available to us until today. Genomic DNA extraction, PCR amplification and Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism conditions (concentration of polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis, dissociation treatment of double- stranded DNA) and comparison with PCR Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism are presented. Since its discovery in 1989, there have been many variations, innovations, and modifications of the method, which makes it very easy, safe, fast and for this reason widely applied in clinical diagnostic, forensic medicine, biochemical, veterinary, microbiological, food and environmental laboratories. One of the possible applications of the method is the diagnosis and identification of mutations in new strains of coronaviruses, because science needs more tools to tackle the problem of this pandemic. The PCR Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism method can be applied in many cases provided that control samples are available and the required conditions of the method are achieved.","Kakavas, Konstantinos V.",Mol Biol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33893925/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06349-2,615

Objective: To determine the aggressiveness of SARS-CoV-2 using symptom progression in COVID-19 patients. Design: Historic cohort study of Mexican patients. Data from January-April 2020 were provided by the Health Ministry. Setting: Population-based. Patients registered in the Epidemiologic Surveillance System in Mexico. Participants: Subjects who sought medical attention for suspicion of COVID-19. All patients were subjected to RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Measurements: We measured the period between onset of nonspecific to specific symptoms for COVID-19 (PONSS) and compared it to the primary outcomes (mortality and pneumonia). Results: 65,500 patients were included. Reported fatalities and pneumonia were 2176 (3.32%), and 11568 (17.66%), respectively. According to the PONSS, patients were distributed as follows: 14.89% in <24 hours, 43.25% between 1-3 days, 31.87% between 4-7 days and 9.97% >7 days. The distribution for mortality and pneumonia was 5.2% and 22.5% in <24 hours, 2.5% and 14% between 1-3 days, 3.6% and 19.5% between 4-7 days, 4.1% and 20.6% >7 days, respectively (p<0.001).

The efforts of managers in the workplace to minimize the health risks and economic damage, however, can provide the employees with a greater sense of security. The aim of this study was to identify the types of workplace responses to the pandemic outbreak with respect to the characteristics of employees and their employers accomplishing the differences in subjective sense of workplace security before the pandemic and during the outbreak. Three hundred and thirty-seven Polish employees completed an online survey during the first 2 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Using the cluster analysis, we identified four subgroups of employees differing in their sense of workplace security, work-related psychological factors, and perceived management styles of their supervisors. Employees led by developers and executive managers sustained a high sense of work security and positive attitude to work, while those led by compromisers and deserter managers suffered from the highest drop of subjective security. In this study, we proposed how employees can be protected from overreactions and unnecessary panic in a time of global crisis by virtue of the psychological competences of their supervisors and employers.","Wojtkowska, Anna; Tyburski, Ernest; Skalacka, Katarzyna; Gasiorowska, Agata",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.635973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34489773/,615

662329,"Clinical Features and Outcomes of ICU Patients with COVID-19 Infection in Tehran, Iran: a Single-Centered Retrospective Cohort Study",2020-12-11,"SARS-CoV-2 is continually evolving, with more contagious mutations spreading rapidly. Using in vitro evolution to affinity maturate the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein towards ACE2 resulted in the more contagious mutations, S477N, E484K, and N501Y, to be among the first selected, explaining the convergent evolution of the “European” (20E-EU1), “British” (501.V1),”South African” (501.V2), and ‘‘Brazilian” variants (501.V3). Plotting the binding affinity to ACE2 of all RBD mutations against their incidence in the population shows a strong correlation between the two. Further in vitro evolution enhancing binding by 600-fold provides guidelines towards potentially new evolving mutations with even higher infectivity. For example, Q498R epistatic to N501Y. Nevertheless, the high-affinity RBD is also an efficient drug, inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection. The 2.9Å Cryo-EM structure of the high-affinity complex, including all rapidly spreading mutations, provides a structural basis for future drug and vaccine development and for in silico evaluation of known antibodies.","Zahradník, Jiří; Marciano, Shir; Shemesh, Maya; Zoler, Eyal; Chiaravalli, Jeanne; Meyer, Björn; Rudich, Yinon; Dym, Orly; Elad, Nadav; Schreiber, Gideon",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.06.425392,615

Here, we introduce a novel surgical technique of video-assisted transaxillary nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate implant-based breast reconstruction and describe the detailed surgical procedure using this technique. METHODS: Detailed steps of surgical procedure, the patient characteristics and the mean operative time of this new technique were described in this article. All patients were asked to score their satisfaction with their reconstructed breasts preoperatively, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months postoperatively using the BREAST-Q. RESULTS: At first, we used our “conventional method” and performed on 10 patients from April 2017 to June 2020; the operative time was 324.80 ± 66.39 minutes. After improving several procedures of the technique, the “optimized method” was performed on 14 cases from July 2020 to November 2020; the operative time decreased to 193.71 ± 28.75 minutes with shortest was 133 minutes; the optimized method was novel and easy to learn and be generalized. Most of the patients were satisfied with the reconstruction results. There was no significant difference between preoperative scores and scores at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months (p = 0.364). Since there is no wound on the breast dome, no obvious postoperative complications were observed except for one patient presented with infection. CONCLUSIONS: This new technique has allowed surgeons to achieve excellent and reproducible outcomes in a single-stage procedure and represents an excellent technique for patients who wish to have a scarless and aesthetically pleasing appearance after mastectomy for breast cancer. This article also highlights the mean operative time (193.71 ± 28.75 minutes) that has been made possible with this new technique.

We investigated here whether the tRNA occupying the ribosomal E site that precedes a slippery site influences -1 PRF. Using the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) frameshift region, we found that mutating the E-site codon altered the -1 PRF efficiency. When the HIV-1 slippery sequence was replaced with other viral slippery sequences, mutating the E-site codon also altered the -1 PRF efficiency. Because HIV-1 -1 PRF can be recapitulated in bacteria, we used a bacterial ribosome system to select, by random mutagenesis, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) mutations that modify the expression of a reporter requiring HIV-1 -1 PRF. Three mutants were isolated, which are located in helices 21 and 22 of 16S rRNA, a region involved in translocation and E-site tRNA binding. We propose a novel model where -1 PRF is triggered by an incomplete translocation and depends not only on the tRNAs interacting with the P- and A-site codons, but also on the tRNA occupying the E site.","Léger, Mélissa; Dulude, Dominic; Steinberg, Sergey V.; Brakier-Gingras, Léa",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17704133/,615

New infections in one local district do not just depend on properties of the district, but also on the strength of social ties of its population with populations in other districts and their own degree of infectiousness. We show that SARS-CoV-2 infections during the first wave of the pandemic spread across district borders in England as a function of pre-crisis commute to work streams between districts. Crucially, the strength of this spatial contagion depends on the phase of the epidemic. In the first pre-lockdown phase, the spread of the virus across district borders is high. During the lockdown period, the cross-border spread of new infections slows down significantly. Spatial contagion increases again after the lockdown is eased but not statistically significantly so.","Laroze, Denise; Neumayer, Eric; Plümper, Thomas",Soc Sci Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113655; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953620308741; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953620308741?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33388620/,615

As B-lines can be detected with minimal training using point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), we examined the frequency, clinical associations, and outcomes of B-lines when found using a simplified POCUS method in acutely ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, hospital data from COVID-19 patients who had undergone lung imaging during standard echocardiography or POCUS were reviewed for an ultrasound lung comet (ULC) sign, defined as the presence of ≥3 B-lines from images of only the antero-apex of either lung (ULC+). Clinical risk factors, oximetry and radiographic results, and disease severity were analyzed for associations with ULC+. Clinical risk factors and ULC+ were analyzed for associations with hospital mortality or the need for intensive care in multivariable models. RESULTS: Of N = 160 patients, age (mean ± standard deviation) was 64.8 ± 15.5 years, and 46 (29%) died. ULC+ was present in 100/160 (62%) of patients overall, in 81/103 (79%) of severe-or-greater disease versus 19/57 (33%) of moderate-or-less disease (P < .0001) and was associated with mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-5.4], P = .02) and the need for intensive care (OR = 5.23 [95% CI: 2.42-12.40], P < .0001). In the multivariable models, symptom duration and severe-or-greater disease were associated with ULC+, and ULC+, diabetes, and symptom duration were associated with the need for intensive care. CONCLUSIONS: B-lines in the upper chest were common and related to disease severity, intensive care, and hospital mortality in COVID-19.
