78,78,78,Pandemic influenza preparedness: an ethical framework to guide decision-making,14.929076,3.7714527,2006-12-04,"BACKGROUND: Planning for the next pandemic influenza outbreak is underway in hospitals across the world. The global SARS experience has taught us that ethical frameworks to guide decision-making may help to reduce collateral damage and increase trust and solidarity within and between health care organisations. Good pandemic planning requires reflection on values because science alone cannot tell us how to prepare for a public health crisis. DISCUSSION: In this paper, we present an ethical framework for pandemic influenza planning. The ethical framework was developed with expertise from clinical, organisational and public health ethics and validated through a stakeholder engagement process. The ethical framework includes both substantive and procedural elements for ethical pandemic influenza planning. The incorporation of ethics into pandemic planning can be helped by senior hospital administrators sponsoring its use, by having stakeholders vet the framework, and by designing or identifying decision review processes. We discuss the merits and limits of an applied ethical framework for hospital decision-making, as well as the robustness of the framework. SUMMARY: The need for reflection on the ethical issues raised by the spectre of a pandemic influenza outbreak is great. Our efforts to address the normative aspects of pandemic planning in hospitals have generated interest from other hospitals and from the governmental sector. The framework will require re-evaluation and refinement and we hope that this paper will generate feedback on how to make it even more robust.","Thompson, Alison K; Faith, Karen; Gibson, Jennifer L; Upshur, Ross EG",BMC Med Ethics,55,22

Developing a conceptual vocabulary for understanding the relationship between material and institutional hybrids, the paper compares human tissue engineering (TE) and xenotransplantation (XT), areas of innovation which regulators have sought to govern separately and in isolation from one another. Contrasting definitional boundaries and regulatory mechanisms partition them socio-institutionally. But despite these attempts at purification, TE and XT have proven increasingly difficult to tell apart in practical and material terms. Human and animal matters, cell cultures and tissue products have much greater corporeal connection than has been institutionally recognized, and are therefore a source of acute instability in the regulation of implants and transplants. This paper tells the story of how the messy worlds of TE and XT have leaked into one another, calling into question the abilities of regulation to adequately control hybrid innovations.","Brown, Nik; Faulkner, Alex; Kent, Julie; Michael, Mike",Soc Theory Health,55,1

With this goal mostly achieved, discussion of etiological factors should be reintroduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V). A research agenda for the DSM-V advocated the “development of a pathophysiologically based classification system”. The author critically reviews the neuroevolutionary literature on stress-induced and fear circuitry disorders and related amygdala-driven, species-atypical fear behaviors of clinical severity in adult humans. Over 30 empirically testable/falsifiable predictions are presented. It is noted that in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10, the classification of stress and fear circuitry disorders is neither mode-of-acquisition-based nor brain-evolution-based. For example, snake phobia (innate) and dog phobia (overconsolidational) are clustered together. Similarly, research on blood-injection-injury-type-specific phobia clusters two fears different in their innateness: 1) an arguably ontogenetic memory-trace-overconsolidation-based fear (hospital phobia) and 2) a hardwired (innate) fear of the sight of one's blood or a sharp object penetrating one's skin. Genetic architecture-charting of fear-circuitry-related traits has been challenging. Various, non-phenotype-based architectures can serve as targets for research. In this article, the author will propose one such alternative genetic architecture. This article was inspired by the following: A) Nesse's “Smoke-Detector Principle”, B) the increasing suspicion that the “smooth” rather than “lumpy” distribution of complex psychiatric phenotypes (including fear-circuitry disorders) may in some cases be accounted for by oligogenic (and not necessarily polygenic) transmission, and C) insights from the initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium published in late 2005. Neuroevolutionary insights relevant to fear circuitry symptoms that primarily emerge overconsolidationally (especially Combat related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) are presented. Also introduced is a human-evolution-based principle for clustering innate fear traits. The “Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle” of innate fears proposed in this article may be useful in the development of a neuroevolution-based taxonomic re-clustering of stress-triggered and fear-circuitry disorders in DSM-V. Four broad clusters of evolved fear circuits are proposed based on their time-depths: 1) Mesozoic (mammalian-wide) circuits hardwired by wild-type alleles driven to fixation by Mesozoic selective sweeps; 2) Cenozoic (simian-wide) circuits relevant to many specific phobias; 3) mid Paleolithic and upper Paleolithic (Homo sapiens-specific) circuits (arguably resulting mostly from mate-choice-driven stabilizing selection); 4) Neolithic circuits (arguably mostly related to stabilizing selection driven by gene–culture co-evolution). More importantly, the author presents evolutionary perspectives on warzone-related PTSD, Combat-Stress Reaction, Combat-related Stress, Operational-Stress, and other deployment-stress-induced symptoms. The Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle presented in this article may help explain the dissimilar stress-resilience levels following different types of acute threat to survival of oneself or one's progency (aka DSM-III and DSM-V PTSD Criterion-A events). PTSD rates following exposure to lethal inter-group violence (combat, warzone exposure or intentionally caused disasters such as terrorism) are usually 5–10 times higher than rates following large-scale natural disasters such as forest fires, floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes. The author predicts that both intentionally-caused large-scale bioevent-disasters, as well as natural bioevents such as SARS and avian flu pandemics will be an exception and are likely to be followed by PTSD rates approaching those that follow warzone exposure. During bioevents, Amygdala-driven and locus-coeruleus-driven epidemic pseudosomatic symptoms may be an order of magnitude more common than infection-caused cytokine-driven symptoms. Implications for the red cross and FEMA are discussed. It is also argued that hospital phobia as well as dog phobia, bird phobia and bat phobia require re-taxonomization in DSM-V in a new “overconsolidational disorders” category anchored around PTSD. The overconsolidational spectrum category may be conceptualized as straddling the fear circuitry spectrum disorders and the affective spectrum disorders categories, and may be a category for which Pitman's secondary prevention propranolol regimen may be specifically indicated as a “morning after pill” intervention. Predictions are presented regarding obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (e.g., female-pattern hoarding vs. male-pattern hoarding) and “culture-bound” acute anxiety symptoms (taijin-kyofusho, koro, shuk yang, shook yong, suo yang, rok-joo, jinjinia-bemar, karoshi, gwarosa, Voodoo death). Also discussed are insights relevant to pseudoneurological symptoms and to the forthcoming Dissociative-Conversive disorders category in DSM-V, including what the author terms fright-triggered acute pseudo-localized symptoms (i.e., pseudoparalysis, pseudocerebellar imbalance, psychogenic blindness, pseudoseizures, and epidemic sociogenic illness). Speculations based on studies of the human abnormal-spindle-like, microcephaly-associated (ASPM) gene, the microcephaly primary autosomal recessive (MCPH) gene, and the forkhead box p2 (FOXP2) gene are made and incorporated into what is termed “The pre-FOXP2 Hypothesis of Blood-Injection-Injury Phobia.” Finally, the author argues for a non-reductionistic fusion of “distal (evolutionary) neurobiology” with clinical “proximal neurobiology,” utilizing neurological heuristics. It is noted that the value of re-clustering fear traits based on behavioral ethology, human-phylogenomics-derived endophenotypes and on ontogenomics (gene–environment interactions) can be confirmed or disconfirmed using epidemiological or twin studies and psychiatric genomics.","Bracha, H.

Forty-two episodes were investigated in 40 individuals. The cardinal symptom was the acute onset of cough (100%), usually productive (90%). Wheezing was noted by 62% of patients, but heard on ausculation in only 31%. A potential pathogen was isolated in 29% of cases with a virus (eight cases) being identified more frequently than either Mycoplasma pneumoniae (three cases) or a bacterium (three cases). The acute illness was associated with significant reductions in forced expired volume in 1 second (P<0·02) and peak expiratory flow (P<0·001) but not forced vital capacity compared to 6 weeks later. Ten of the 27 (37%) patients who had a histamine challenge test performed at 6 weeks had a PD(20) of <7·8 μmol histamine. Thirty-nine episodes (93%) were treated with antibiotics by the general practitioner, the clinical course being unremarkable apart from one patient who developed a lingular pneumonia despite antibiotic therapy. Further studies are required to assess whether acute bronchitis causes an acute increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness and whether either antibiotics or inhaled bronchodilators or anti-inflammatory therapy has a useful role in the management of this predominantly viral illness.","Boldy, D.A.R.; Skidmore, S.J.; Ayres, J.G.",Respir Med,55,1

It argues that this engagement does not just take the form of overt deliberation. It shows in more modest ways as reflection-in-action, an experimental process in which new technology is fitted into existing practices. In this process challenged values are re-articulated in pragmatic solutions to the problem of working with new technology. This art of working with technology is also modest in the sense that it is not oriented to shaping one’s own subjectivity in relation to technology. It emanates from human existence as relational and aims at securing good relationships. The argument will be developed in relation to a case study of the ways in which homecare workers engaged with the value of privacy, challenged by tele-monitoring technology that was newly introduced into their work.","Kamphof, Ike",Found Sci,55,1

It is divided into two broad classes: classical strains that are a notable problem in health care settings due to multidrug resistance, and hypervirulent (hv) strains that are historically drug sensitive but able to establish disease in immunocompetent hosts. Alarmingly, there has been an increased frequency of clinical isolates that have both drug resistance and hv-associated genes. One such gene, rmpA, encodes a transcriptional regulator required for maximal capsule (cps) gene expression and confers hypermucoviscosity (HMV). This link has resulted in the assumption that HMV is caused by elevated capsule production. However, we recently reported a new cps regulator, RmpC, and ΔrmpC mutants have reduced cps expression but retain HMV, suggesting that capsule production and HMV may be separable traits. Here, we report the identification of a small protein, RmpD, that is essential for HMV but does not impact capsule. RmpD is 58 residues with a putative N-terminal transmembrane domain and highly positively charged C-terminal half, and it is conserved among other hv K. pneumoniae strains. Expression of rmpD in trans complements both ΔrmpD and ΔrmpA mutants for HMV, suggesting that RmpD is the key driver of this phenotype. The rmpD gene is located between rmpA and rmpC, within an operon regulated by RmpA. These data, combined with our previous work, suggest a model in which the RmpA-associated phenotypes are largely due to RmpA activating the expression of rmpD to produce HMV and rmpC to stimulate cps expression.","Walker, Kimberly A.; Treat, Logan P.; Sepúlveda, Victoria E.; Miller, Virginia L.",mBio,55,1

LLD impacts well-being, with loneliness and small social networks being typical. It has also been linked to cognitive dysfunction and an increased risk of developing dementia. Safety and efficacy of pharmacological treatments for LLD have been debated, and cognitive dysfunction often persists even after remission. Various cognitive interventions have been proposed for LLD. Among these, one has received special attention: foreign language learning could serve as a social intervention that simultaneously targets brain structures affected in LLD. Lifelong bilingualism may significantly delay the onset of cognitive impairment symptoms by boosting cognitive reserve. Even late-life foreign language learning without lifelong bilingualism can train cognitive flexibility. It is then counterintuitive that the effects of language learning on LLD have never been examined. In order to create a theoretical basis for further interdisciplinary research, this paper presents a status quo of current work through two meta-analyses investigating cognitive functioning in LLD on the one hand and in senior bilinguals or seniors following a language course on the other hand. While LLD was consistently associated with cognitive dysfunction, inconsistent results were found for bilingualism and language learners. Possible reasons for this and suggestions for future research are subsequently discussed.","Brouwer, Jelle; van den Berg, Floor; Knooihuizen, Remco; Loerts, Hanneke; Keijzer, Merel",Behav Sci (Basel),55,22

OBJECTIVE: This article presents the neuroprotective effects of citicoline and their mechanisms in glaucoma disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The relevance of citicoline is explained against the background of neuroanatomy, neuroimaging, and the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Data from experimental and clinical studies are presented and a conclusion is drawn for clinical application. RESULTS: Citicoline has a neuroprotective effect via mechanisms relevant to glaucoma. The neuroprotective effect of citicoline in open-angle glaucoma can be demonstrated functionally and morphologically. It is independent of the glaucoma damage and intraocular pressure, and usually occurs only after 1 year. The effects of oral citicoline occur at a daily dose of 500–1000 mg. Citicoline can be taken permanently or in cycles. No side effects occurred in the studies when taking citicoline. Citicoline can improve cognitive performance and thus treatment adherence as well as quality of life in glaucoma patients. CONCLUSION: This relatively old nootropic drug, which is now marketed as a food supplement, seems to be a valuable addition to conventional treatment and also a rational option for prophylaxis of open-angle glaucoma.","Jünemann, Anselm G.

Although our understanding in the pathophysiological features of sepsis has increased significantly during the past decades, there is still lack of specific treatment for sepsis. Neutrophils are important regulators against invading pathogens, and their role during sepsis has been studied extensively. It has been suggested that the migration, the antimicrobial activity, and the function of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have all been impaired during sepsis, which results in an inappropriate response to primary infection and potentially increase the susceptibility to secondary infection. On the other hand, accumulating evidence has shown that the reversal or restoration of neutrophil function can promote bacterial clearance and improve sepsis outcome, supporting the idea that targeting neutrophils may be a promising strategy for sepsis treatment. In this review, we will give an overview of the role of neutrophils during sepsis and discuss the potential therapeutic strategy targeting neutrophils.","Shen, Xiaofei; Cao, Ke; Zhao, Yang; Du, Junfeng",Front Pharmacol,55,1

This study estimates progress and gaps in reaching the UNAIDS 2020 target of 90% knowledge of status, and the efficiency of HIV testing services in sub-Saharan Africa, where two thirds of all people living with HIV reside. METHODS: For this modelling study, we used data from 183 population-based surveys (including more than 2·7 million participants) and national HIV testing programme reports (315 country-years) from 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa as inputs into a mathematical model to examine trends in knowledge of status among people living with HIV, median time from HIV infection to diagnosis, HIV testing positivity, and proportion of new diagnoses among all positive tests, adjusting for retesting. We included data from 2000 to 2019, and projected results to 2020. FINDINGS: Across sub-Saharan Africa, knowledge of status steadily increased from 5·7% (95% credible interval [CrI] 4·6–7·0) in 2000 to 84% (82–86) in 2020. 12 countries and one region, southern Africa, reached the 90% target. In 2020, knowledge of status was lower among men (79%, 95% CrI 76–81) than women (87%, 85–89) across sub-Saharan Africa. People living with HIV aged 15–24 years were the least likely to know their status (65%, 62–69), but the largest gap in terms of absolute numbers was among men aged 35–49 years, with 701 000 (95% CrI 611 000–788 000) remaining undiagnosed. As knowledge of status increased from 2000 to 2020, the median time to diagnosis decreased from 9·6 years (9·1–10) to 2·6 years (1·8–3·5), HIV testing positivity declined from 9·0% (7·7–10) to 2·8% (2·1–3·9), and the proportion of first-time diagnoses among all positive tests dropped from 89% (77–96) to 42% (30–55). INTERPRETATION: On the path towards the next UNAIDS target of 95% diagnostic coverage by 2025, and in a context of declining positivity and yield of first-time diagnoses, disparities in knowledge of status must be addressed. Increasing knowledge of status and treatment coverage among older men could be crucial to reducing HIV incidence among women in sub-Saharan Africa, and by extension, reducing mother-to-child transmission.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is still one of the most frequent and deadly tumor in men and analysis of EVs from biological fluids of PCa patients has proven the feasibility and the unprecedented potential of such an approach. Here, we exploited an antibody-based proteomic technology, i.e. the Reverse-Phase Protein microArrays (RPPA), to measure key antigens and activated signaling in EVs isolated from sera of PCa patients. Notably, we found tumor-specific protein profiles associated with clinical settings as well as candidate markers for EV-based tumor diagnosis. Among others, PD-L1, ERG, Integrin-β5, Survivin, TGF-β, phosphorylated-TSC2 as well as partners of the MAP-kinase and mTOR pathways emerged as differentially expressed endpoints in tumor-derived EVs. In addition, the retrospective analysis of EVs from a 15-year follow-up cohort generated a protein signature with prognostic significance. Our results confirm that serum-derived EV cargo may be exploited to improve the current diagnostic procedures while providing potential prognostic and predictive information. The approach proposed here has been already applied to tumor entities other than PCa, thus proving its value in translational medicine and paving the way to innovative, clinically meaningful tools.","Signore, Michele; Alfonsi, Romina; Federici, Giulia; Nanni, Simona; Addario, Antonio; Bertuccini, Lucia; Aiello, Aurora; Di Pace, Anna Laura; Sperduti, Isabella; Muto, Giovanni; Giacobbe, Alessandro; Collura, Devis; Brunetto, Lidia; Simone, Giuseppe; Costantini, Manuela; Crinò, Lucio; Rossi, Stefania; Tabolacci, Claudio; Diociaiuti, Marco; Merlino, Tania; Gallucci, Michele; Sentinelli, Steno; Papalia, Rocco; De Maria, Ruggero; Bonci, Désirée",Cell Death Dis,55,22

We determined which induction medications were used most frequently for adult trauma RSIs and their associations with hemodynamics and outcomes. We hypothesized that etomidate is the most commonly used induction agent and has similar outcomes to other induction agents. METHODS: This retrospective review at two U.S. level I trauma centers evaluated adult trauma patients undergoing RSI within 24 h of admission, between 01/01/2016 and 12/31/2017. We compared patient characteristics and outcomes by induction agent. Comparisons on the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality and secondary outcomes of peri-intubation hypotension, hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS), ventilator days, and complications used logistic regression or negative binomial regression. Regression models adjusted for hospital site, age, patient severity measures, and intubation location. RESULTS: Among 1303 trauma patients undergoing RSI within 24 h of admission, 948 (73%) were intubated in the emergency department (ED) and 325 (25%) in the operating room (OR). The most common induction agents were etomidate (68%), propofol (17%), and ketamine (11%). In-hospital mortality was highest in the etomidate group (25.5%), followed by ketamine (17%), and propofol (1.8%). CONCLUSION: Etomidate was most commonly used in ED intubations; propofol was most used in the OR. Compared to propofol, patients induced with etomidate had higher mortality and complication rates. Findings should be interpreted with caution given limited generalizability and residual confounding by indication.","Kuza, Catherine M.; To, Jocelyn; Chang, Angela; Mert, Melissa; Yau, Anita; Singh, Mandeep; Choi, Katherine J.; Huang, Samantha; Wier, Julian; Inaba, Kenji; Hirji, Sameer A.; Spencer, Dean; Albertson, Spencer; Grigorian, Areg; Nahmias, Jeffry T.",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,55,5

As the size of training data is typically small in this task, we propose a machine learning method referred to as context-guided learning (CGL) to overcome the over-fitting problem. Exploiting a large amount of contexts regarding relations between the labeling criteria (e.g. safety) and attributes, CGL guides learning in the correct direction by estimating a roughly appropriate weight for each attribute by the contexts. This idea was implemented by a regularization approach similar to support vector machines. Experiments were conducted with 158 kinds of orders in three datasets. The experimental results showed high effectiveness of the contextual guidance over existing ranking methods.","Kato, Makoto P.; Imrattanatrai, Wiradee; Yamamoto, Takehiro; Ohshima, Hiroaki; Tanaka, Katsumi",Advances in Information Retrieval,55,1

It belongs to the picornavirus family of nonenveloped positive-strand RNA viruses. The RNA synthesis of rhinovirus is carried out by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, also known as 3D(Pol). It catalyzes the synthesis of negative-strand RNA using a positive-strand template. The structure of the enzyme consists of three domains: palm, fingers, and thumb domains and Mg(2+) in the active site. These conserved structural features of the enzyme help in catalyzing phosphodiester bond formation between the two consecutive nucleotide units complimentary to the template RNA using a VPg primer. Owing to the presence of over 100 serotypes of the enzyme, designing specific inhibitors targeting the polymerase is a challenging task and until now no clinically approved antirhino viral drug is reported.

To fill in this gap, in this work, we investigate event classification under the few-shot learning setting. We propose a novel training method for this problem that extensively exploit the support set during the training process of a few-shot learning model. In particular, in addition to matching the query example with those in the support set for training, we seek to further match the examples within the support set themselves. This method provides more training signals for the models and can be applied to every metric-learning-based few-shot learning methods. Our extensive experiments on two benchmark EC datasets show that the proposed method can improve the best reported few-shot learning models by up to 10% on accuracy for event classification.","Lai, Viet Dac; Dernoncourt, Franck; Nguyen, Thien Huu",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,55,1

Historical evidence points to large upfront effects from pandemics and natural disasters, but the medium‐term outcomes are mixed, with policy responses a crucial determinant. Longer recessions and financial crises tend to lead to weaker medium‐term growth. ▪ The coronavirus may trigger annual GDP declines among the worst seen in the last 100 years. Economies can bounce back sharply after such declines, but our analysis suggests output losses also endure in a significant number of cases. ▪ The US interwar experience shows the danger of allowing financial distress to snowball and exacerbate GDP declines. The weakness of medium‐term growth after the global financial crisis confirms the long‐term impact of such distress. ▪ A key risk for the medium term is that firms and/or households react to the coronavirus recession and disruption by raising savings, accelerating a shift toward ‘Japanification’ of major economies. ▪ Our baseline forecasts envisage moderate medium‐term output losses due to coronavirus, in part reflecting rapid and large‐scale policy interventions.

A set of communication patterns, based on asynchronous message-passing, has been proposed to loosely integrate medical devices and apps. These patterns guarantee the point-to-point quality of communication service (QoS) by local inspection of messages at its constituent components. These local mechanisms inspect the property of messages to enforce a set of parametrized local QoS properties. Adjusting these parameters to achieve the required point-to-point QoS is non-trivial and depends on the involved components and the underlying network. We use Timed Rebeca, an actor-based formal modeling language, to model such systems and asses their QoS properties by model checking. We model the components of communication patterns as distinct actors. A composite medical system using several instances of patterns is subject to state-space explosion. We propose a reduction technique preserving QoS properties. We prove that our technique is sound and show the applicability of our approach in reducing the state space by modeling a clinical scenario made of several instances of patterns.","Zarneshan, Mahsa; Ghassemi, Fatemeh; Sirjani, Marjan",Coordination Models and Languages,55,1

The current study purposed to investigate if SORT maneuver (sniffing position, NGT orientation, contralateral rotation, and twisting movement) increases the success rate of NGT correct placement versus neck flexion lateral pressure (NFLP) method. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial study was conducted in two university affiliated intensive care units (tertiary referral center). Three hundred and ninety-six critically ill patients older than 18 years of age were randomly divided into SORT (n = 200) and NFLP (n = 196) groups. The technique was classified as “failed” after the third unsuccessful attempt. Patient characteristics, success rate for the first attempt, time required for the successful first attempt and overall successful insertion time, various complications including kinking, coiling and bleeding and ease of insertion were noted as main outcomes measured. RESULTS: Ease of insertion was significantly better in the SORT group compared to the NFLP group (P < 0.001). The number of failed attempts was significantly higher in the NFLP group (7.5%) vs the SORT group (3.0%) (P = 0.046). The pattern of complications was not different between two study groups (P = 0.242). The odds of stage II (odds ratio (OR) = 49.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 25.2 to 98.6), stage III (OR = 67.1; 95% CI 14.9 to 302.8)) and stage IV (OR = 11.8; 95% CI 3.4 to 41.2) ease of insertion were much higher in NFLP compared to SORT group, after adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI). The odds of failure was not significantly different in NFLP group compared to SORT group (OR = 2.3; 95% CI 0.85 to 6.3), after adjusting for age and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: SORT technique may be considered as a promising method for successful NGT insertions in critically ill patients. However, more trials are needed to confirm the results of this study. The decision must account for individual patient and clinical factors and the operator’s experience and preference.

The tipping point of this phenomenon is often attributed to the Rodney King incident in Los Angeles in 1991, where Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers were videoed assaulting a lone black male. They were arrested and charged but eventually all were acquitted, thereby etching deep distrust between communities and police. Now the Rodney King example is an extreme and criminal act by police but it was the beginning of communities and media focusing on what the police were doing and how they were doing it. This lack of legitimacy coupled with what is referred to as the militarization of policing have lasting consequences and impacts on police–community relations and how interactions between police and community shape society today. In the wake of pandemic policing due to COVID-19, there are tales of two eventualities for police legitimacy that will be explored in this article: (1) The police response to the pandemic results in further militarization and draws deeper divides between police and communities or (2) the police response is compassionate and build on procedurally just operations resulting in the rebuilding of police legitimacy post-pandemic.","Jones, Daniel J",,55,1

DKD is classified on albuminuria and reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) but these have modest value for predicting future renal status. There is an unmet need for biomarkers that can be used in clinical settings which also improve prediction of renal decline on top of routinely available data, particularly in the early stages. The iBEAt study of the BEAt-DKD project aims to determine whether renal imaging biomarkers (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US)) provide insight into the pathogenesis and heterogeneity of DKD (primary aim) and whether they have potential as prognostic biomarkers in DKD (secondary aim). METHODS: iBEAt is a prospective multi-centre observational cohort study recruiting 500 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and eGFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73m(2). At baseline, blood and urine will be collected, clinical examinations will be performed, and medical history will be obtained. These assessments will be repeated annually for 3 years. At baseline each participant will also undergo quantitative renal MRI and US with central processing of MRI images. Biological samples will be stored in a central laboratory for biomarker and validation studies, and data in a central data depository. Data analysis will explore the potential associations between imaging biomarkers and renal function, and whether the imaging biomarkers improve the prediction of DKD progression. Ancillary substudies will: (1) validate imaging biomarkers against renal histopathology; (2) validate MRI based renal blood flow measurements against H(2)O(15) positron-emission tomography (PET); (3) validate methods for (semi-)automated processing of renal MRI; (4) examine longitudinal changes in imaging biomarkers; (5) examine whether glycocalyx and microvascular measures are associated with imaging biomarkers and eGFR decline; (6) explore whether the findings in T2D can be extrapolated to type 1 diabetes. DISCUSSION: iBEAt is the largest DKD imaging study to date and will provide valuable insights into the progression and heterogeneity of DKD. The results may contribute to a more personalised approach to DKD management in patients with T2D.

However, the standard BFO algorithm exists some potential deficiencies, such as the weakness of convergence accuracy and a lack of swarm communication. Owing to the improvement of these issues, an improved BFO algorithm with comprehensive swarm learning strategies (LPCBFO) is proposed. As for the LPCBFO algorithm, each bacterium keeps on moving with stochastic run lengths based on linear-decreasing Lévy flight strategy. Moreover, illuminated by the social learning mechanism of PSO and CSO algorithm, the paper incorporates cooperative communication with the current global best individual and competitive learning into the original BFO algorithm. To examine the optimization capability of the proposed algorithm, six benchmark functions with 30 dimensions are chosen. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the LPCBFO algorithm is superior to the other five algorithms.","Gan, Xiaobing; Xiao, Baoyu",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,55,22

Our controller consists of a reference controller and a tracking controller which drives the actual trajectory to follow the reference trajectory. We identify a type of reference trajectory such that the tracking error between the actual trajectory of the closed-loop system and the reference trajectory can be bounded. Moreover, such a bound on the tracking error is independent of the reference trajectory. Using such bounds on the tracking error, we propose a method that can find a reference trajectory by solving a satisfiability problem over linear constraints. Our overall algorithm guarantees that the resulting controller can make sure every trajectory from the initial set of the system satisfies the given reach-avoid requirement. We also implement our technique in a tool FACTEST. We show that FACTEST can find controllers for four vehicle models (3–6 dimensional state space and 2–4 dimensional input space) across eight scenarios (with up to 22 obstacles), all with running time at the sub-second range.","Fan, Chuchu; Miller, Kristina; Mitra, Sayan",Computer Aided Verification,55,1

Accordingly, this article: 1) defines digital sales interactions (DSIs) as technology-enabled, face-to-face buyer-seller exchanges; 2) proposes a typology of DSIs to set the stage to examine salesperson communication effectiveness; 3) introduces a framework that reifies the sender's auditory and visual cues that can influence receivers' thoughts (i.e., cognition, affect, intention) and activity (i.e., purchase behavior, advocacy); 4) suggests theoretical lenses that can illuminate various aspects of the salesperson's communication barrage; 5) advances how machine learning can be applied to understand what constitutes effective communication in a digital interaction by asking: to what extent does what a salesperson says (auditory cues) and how s/he says it (visual cues) impact her/his effectiveness in a DSI?; and 6) concludes by noting promising future research directions for B2B marketing researchers.","Bharadwaj, Neeraj; Shipley, Garrett M.",,55,16

37663,37663,37663,Reflections on the Pandemic,15.295455,3.7784915,2020-08-08,"PURPOSE: Non-specific low back pain (NLBP) causes an enormous burden to patients and tremendous costs for health care systems worldwide. Frequently, treatments are not oriented to existing guidelines. In the future, digital elements may be promising tools to support guideline-oriented treatment in a broader range of patients. The cluster-randomized controlled “Rise-uP” trial aims to support a General Practitioner (GP)-centered back pain treatment (Registration No: DRKS00015048) and includes the following digital elements: 1) electronic case report form (eCRF), 2) a treatment algorithm for guideline-based clinical decision making of GPs, 3) teleconsultation between GPs and pain specialists for patients at risk for development of chronic back pain, and 4) a multidisciplinary mobile back pain app for all patients (Kaia App). METHODS: In the Rise-uP trial, 111 GPs throughout Bavaria (southern Germany) were randomized either to the Rise-uP intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG). Rise-uP patients were treated according to the guideline-oriented Rise-uP treatment algorithm. Standard of care was applied to the CG patients with consideration given to the “National guideline for the treatment of non-specific back pain”. Pain rating on the numeric rating scale was the primary outcome measure. Psychological measures (anxiety, depression, stress), functional ability, as well as physical and mental wellbeing, served as secondary outcomes. All values were assessed at the beginning of the treatment and at 3-month follow-ups. RESULTS: In total, 1245 patients (IG: 933; CG: 312) with NLBP were included in the study. The Rise-uP group showed a significantly stronger pain reduction compared to the control group after 3 months (IG: M=−33.3% vs CG: M=−14.3%). The Rise-uP group was also superior in secondary outcomes. Furthermore, high-risk patients who received a teleconsultation showed a larger decrease in pain intensity (−43.5%) than CG patients (−14.3%). ANCOVA analysis showed that the impact of teleconsultation was mediated by an increased training activity in the Kaia App. CONCLUSION: Our results show the superiority of the innovative digital treatment algorithm realized in Rise-uP, even though the CG also received relevant active treatment by their GPs. This provides clear evidence that digital treatment may be a promising tool to improve the quality of treatment of non-specific back pain. In 2021, analyses of routine data from statutory health insurances will enable us to investigate the cost-effectiveness of digital treatment.","Priebe, Janosch A; Haas, Katharina K; Moreno Sanchez, Leida F; Schoefmann, Karin; Utpadel-Fischler, Daniel A; Stockert, Paul; Thoma, Reinhard; Schiessl, Christine; Kerkemeyer, Linda; Amelung, Volker; Jedamzik, Siegfried; Reichmann, Jan; Marschall, Ursula; Toelle, Thomas R",J Pain Res,55,22

We report a novel therapeutic strategy that combines adjuvant black phosphorus nanoparticle-based photoacoustic (PA) therapy with checkpoint-blockade immunotherapy. With the mitochondria targeting nanoparticle, PA therapy can achieve localized mechanical damage of mitochondria via PA cavitation and thus achieve precise eradication of the primary tumor. More importantly, PA therapy can generate tumor-associated antigens via the presence of the R848-containing nanoparticles as an adjuvant to promote strong antitumor immune responses. When combined with the checkpoint-blockade using anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, the generated immunological responses will further promote the infiltrating CD8 and CD4 T-cells to increase the CD8/Foxp3 T-cell ratio to inhibit the growth of distant tumors beyond the direct impact range of the PA therapy. Furthermore, the number of memory T cells detected in the spleen is increased, and these cells inhibit tumor recurrence. This proposed strategy offers precise eradication of the primary tumor and can induce long-term tumor-specific immunity.

Thus, we aimed to develop and validate a reliable prognostic signature that can estimate the prognosis for HCC. METHODS: Gene expression profiling and clinical information of 374 HCC patients were derived from the TCGA data portal. The survival-related RBP pairs were determined using univariate cox-regression analysis and the signature was built based on LASSO analysis. All patients were divided patients into high-and low-risk groups according to the optimal cut off of the signature score determined by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The predictive value of the signature was further validated in an independent cohort. RESULTS: A 37-RBP pairs signature consisting of 61 unique genes was constructed which was significantly associated with the survival. The RBP-related signature accurately predicted the prognosis of HCC patients, and patients in high-risk groups showed poor survival in two cohorts. The novel signature was an independent prognostic factor of HCC in two cohorts (all P < 0.001). Furthermore, the C-index of the prognostic model was 0.799, which was higher than that of many established risk models. Pathway and process enrichment analysis showed that the 61 unique genes were mainly enriched in translation, ncRNA metabolic process, RNA splicing, RNA modification, and translational termination. CONCLUSION: The novel proposed RBP-related signature based on relative expression orderings could serve as a promising independent prognostic biomarker for patients with HCC, and could improve the individualized survival prediction in HCC.","Kang, Chunmiao; Jia, Xuanhui; Liu, Hongsheng",Biomed Eng Online,55,1

Improper use of them results in extended recovery periods and even cause damage and pain to the limb. Many existing studies demonstrated that correctly using crutches requires an understanding of the disability or injury of the patient, gait patterns as well as user and crutch interaction during rehabilitation. In this work, a prototype was developed to monitor in real-time the exerted axial force and the tilt angles involved in each gait cycle at a prescribed gait pattern. The prototype is composed for an instrumented forearm crutch with a wireless measurement system. Four gait patterns were tested experimentally in three healthy users. Promising results were obtained that induces the possibility to identify automatically the performed pattern and even typical errors while using forearm crutches. The proposed system opens up a valid alternative to individualize therapy by monitoring the user gait using crutches in the rehabilitation process.","Narváez, Marien; Aranda, Joan",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,55,22

The current study aims to add to this understanding by employing a “linked case"" study design to directly compare the perspectives of patients, their caregivers, and health care professionals (HCPs) involved in a series of single-patient cases of breaking bad news. METHOD: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 13 participants (5 patients, 4 caregivers, 2 surgeons, and 2 nurses) who formed 5 linked cases. Interviews were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis and directly compared within each linked case. RESULTS: Analyses identified 2 main superordinate themes. The first labeled “accurately perceiving and responding to needs,"" included HCPs recognizing and responding to patients’ and caregivers’ individual emotional and informational needs. The second labeled “carers fulfilling necessary roles,"" identified the various roles HCPs and patients’ caregivers took to satisfactorily meet patients’ needs. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest the importance of HCPs accurately perceiving and responding to patients’ and caregivers’ various needs and caregivers ability and willingness to fulfilling support roles in a way that aligns with their own resources and patients’ needs. This highlights the value of HCPs developing and applying interpersonal skills within bad news encounters, working as a team, and exploring caregivers’ resources for patient support.","Matthews, Tamyra; Baken, Donald; Ross, Kirsty",J Psychosoc Oncol Res Pract,55,22

Evidence‐based public health measures to reduce viral spread include—personal isolation, physical distancing, wearing facial masks, frequent hand washing with soap and running water, not touching the face, vaccination, etc. However once infected, recovery relies on host immunity to eradicate the foreign invaders, with symptomatic management, which is the core management strategy in COVID‐19 management guidelines. Researchers have observed that severe COVID‐19 prevalence and mortality is highest in people with preexisting conditions. Eighty percent of these preexisting diseases are lifestyle related. Also, the science of strengthening the immune system by adopting appropriate lifestyle changes is still evolving, especially among the suspected and confirmed COVID‐19 cases. This article briefly highlights the immune response to viral infections including COVID‐19 and refers to evidence that healthy lifestyle practices, enshrined as core aspects of lifestyle medicine, can strengthen the immune response to infections. This may improve outcome in COVID‐19. We therefore recommend specific evidence‐based lifestyle intervention measures that should be considered in the management of COVID‐19.","Monye, Ifeoma; Adelowo, Abiodun Bamidele",,55,1

We wanted to develop an algorithm that automatically recognises and characterises ventilator inflations from ventilator pressure and flow data. METHODS: We downloaded airway pressure and flow data with 100 Hz sampling rate from Dräger Babylog VN500 ventilators ventilating critically ill infants. We developed an open source Python package, Ventiliser, that includes a rule-based algorithm to automatically discretise ventilator data into a sequence of flow and pressure states and to recognise ventilator inflations and an information gain approach to identify inflation phases (inspiration, expiration) and sub-phases (pressure rise, pressure plateau, inspiratory hold etc.). RESULTS: Ventiliser runs on a personal computer and analyses 24 h of ventilation in 2 min. With longer recordings, the processing time increases linearly. It generates a table reporting indices of each breath and its sub-phases. Ventiliser also allows visualisation of individual inflations as waveforms or loops. Ventiliser identified >97% of ventilator inflations and their sub-phases in an out-of-sample validation of manually annotated data. We also present detailed quantitative analysis and comparison of two 1-hour-long ventilation periods. CONCLUSIONS: Ventiliser can analyse ventilation patterns and ventilator–patient interactions over long periods of mechanical ventilation. IMPACT: We have developed a computational method to recognize and analyse ventilator inflations from raw data downloaded from ventilators of preterm and critically ill infants. There have been no previous reports on the computational analysis of neonatal ventilator data. We have made our program, Ventiliser, freely available. Clinicians and researchers can use Ventiliser to analyse ventilator inflations, waveforms and loops over long periods. Ventiliser can also be used to study ventilator–patient interactions.","Chong, David; Morley, Colin J.; Belteki, Gusztav",Pediatr Res,55,22

Social distancing and lockdowns may reduce the incidence of trauma; however, a significant decline in presentations of acute medical conditions such as stroke and ACS have been reported. Furthermore, health system capacities are substantially altered, with elective surgeries postponed to devote resources to COVID-related illness and high acuity non-COVID illness. METHODS: We reviewed all emergency department and inpatient consultations to the neurosurgical service at a Level 1 Trauma Center during an 8-week post-lockdown period (3/15-5/4), quantifying overall volume, as well the distribution of problem types and management endpoints. RESULTS: Pandemic period consult volumes were significantly lower than those of parallel periods in 2016–2019 (388 vs. a 4-year average of 576, P < .001, Pearson's chi-squared test). Compared to 2016–2019, 2020 consult volume was decreased by 37% during the first four weeks following lockdown (204 vs. 280, P = .01), and by 48% during the latter four weeks (184 vs. 296, P < .001). Pandemic period consults required acute surgery in 21% of cases, non-acute or non-surgical management in 75%, and palliative management (CMO, hospice, death) in 4%. During the prior year (2019), these proportions were 15%, 80% and 5%, respectively (P = .06). The distribution of consult problem types was not statistically different between periods. Among cranial consults, trauma comprised 45% during the pandemic compared to 41% in the analogous 2019 period; tumor 20% vs 18%; vascular 16%; and ICH/stroke 8%. Among spinal consults, trauma comprised 47% vs 43%, tumor 6% vs 3%, and degenerative disc disease 29% vs 36%. CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical consult volume increasingly declined throughout the post-lockdown COVID-19 pandemic period, which was unprecedented over the 5 years studied. A higher proportion of consults resulted in acute care surgery, approaching statistical significance. Surprisingly, problem types did not differ in the pandemic period despite vastly different social circumstances. Further study will employ time series analysis to contextualize these changes within local COVID-19 surge data.","Shao, Belinda; Tang, Oliver Y; Abdulrazeq, Hael; Sastry, Rahul; Leary, Owen P; Wilson, Ira; Asaad, Wael; Gokaslan, Ziya L",Neurosurgery,55,1

Rapid acceleration of COVID-19 cases in mid-March 2020, forced the shuttering of senior centers in New York City’s (NYC) five boroughs. Center programming was suspended, including congregate meals for older adults. As centers, a focal point for social interaction, closed, older community residents experienced social isolation, compounded further by social distancing. Key informant interviews with the leadership of community-based multi-service agencies, provided frontline perspectives on essential programmatic services NYC’s oldest residents needed, challenges encountered, and strategies implemented to adjust to issues emerging from the pandemic. Alternative meal delivery plans were devised by the City and aging services agencies initiated wellness outreach calls and also facilitated access to technological resources to maintain social connections. Various advocacy and policy-relevant insights emerged from these experiences. Specifically, a priority in preparedness planning should be on solutions addressing the social isolation precipitated by the pandemic that older adults experienced. Technology may help. Devoting more programming to activities enabling older adults to utilize accessible technological resources is key. Efforts implemented during the pandemic have demonstrated that with preparation and access to resources, virtual communication is a feasible option for the older population. With limited access to alternative neighborhood food sources, devising a contingency plan for adequate food delivery services to replace congregate meals also merits attention. Overall, the pandemic’s widespread impact highlights the importance of creating an infrastructure that builds upon older persons’ strengths, while addressing their vulnerabilities, enabling them to thrive.","Raveis, Victoria; Torres, Anderson; Arce-Bello, Jane; Atmore-Dolly, Donna; Nickerson, Allison",Innov Aging,55,22

Medical schools postponed student participation in direct patient care in mid-March 2020, creating the need for rapidly-designed, virtual, and innovative learning experiences. METHODS: Utilizing Kern’s six-step approach to curriculum development, faculty and medical student liaisons rapidly designed a six-week online and interactive course for clerkship-year students and above, launched on March 30th, 2020. “Patients, Populations, and Pandemics: Responding to COVID-19” emphasized honing higher level skills of Bloom’s taxonomy, namely evaluating, synthesizing, and creating. Following weekly faculty-led lectures, student groups identified research questions, analyzed literature, presented data, critiqued peer presentations, and created infographics for the public. RESULTS: We aimed to maintain quality and interactiveness despite challenges posed by our timeframe, the evolving COVID-19 literature, and the virtual setting. We recruited frontline faculty and designed the course to facilitate discussion, thereby promoting real-time exploration of public health and clinical challenges. Encouraging student participation, we incorporated group synthesis sessions and instructed use of video, hand-raising, and chat features. In a survey administered at the end of the first week, 85.7% (18/21) of students strongly agreed or agreed that small group presentations successfully enabled synthesis of new and emerging data. Among the 29 enrolled students, 82.8% (24/29) of students completed final course evaluations, with 87.5% (21/24) agreeing that the learning activities “usually” or “always” helped meet the learning objectives identified at the beginning of the course. The course was rated as “excellent” or “very good” by 83.3% (20/24) of students. CONCLUSION: Lessons learned include providing students with increased direction on critically reviewing peer presentations and imparting guidance on best practices for data synthesis. This course model will be disseminated throughout our institution and beyond to address challenges in remote learning and to serve as a paradigm during future health crises.

The results reveal that performance expectancy has the strongest impact on the intentions to use contact-tracing apps. The accuracy, effort expectancy and social influence are also important, followed by perceived value, safety and perceived privacy. Facilitating condition is listed as much less important. The theoretical and managerial implications of these results are discussed.","Ezzaouia, Imane; Bulchand-Gidumal, Jacques",Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism 2021,55,1

In particular, supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning will be the main methods to play a role in the implementation of AI. Severely ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are closely monitored in order to be able to quickly respond to any changes. These monitoring data can be used to train AI models to predict critical phases in advance, making an earlier reaction possible. To achieve this a large amount of clinical data are needed in order to train models and an external validation on independent cohorts should take place. Prospective studies with treatment of patients admitted to the ICU with AI assistance should show that they provide a benefit for patients. We present the most important resources from de-identified (anonymized) patient data on open-source use for AI research in intensive care medicine. The focus is on neurological diseases in the ICU, therefore, we provide an overview of existing models for prediction of outcome, vasospasms, intracranial pressure and levels of consciousness. To introduce the advantages of AI in the clinical routine, more AI-based models with larger datasets will be needed. To achieve this international cooperation is absolutely necessary. Clinical centers associated with universities are needed to provide a constant validation of applied models as these models can change during use or a bias can develop during the training. A strong commitment to AI research is important for Germany, not only with respect to academic achievements but also in the light of a rapidly growing influence of AI on the economy.","Schweingruber, N.; Gerloff, C.",Nervenarzt,55,22

The quality of such experimental models and particularly the level at which they represent cell behavior in the native tissue, is of critical importance for our understanding of cell interactions within tissues and organs. Conventionally, in vitro models are based on experimental manipulation of mammalian cells, grown as monolayers on flat, two-dimensional (2D) substrates. Despite the amazing progress and discoveries achieved with flat biology models, our ability to translate biological insights has been limited, since the 2D environment does not reflect the physiological behavior of cells in real tissues. Advances in 3D cell biology and engineering have led to the development of a new generation of cell culture formats that can better recapitulate the in vivo microenvironment, allowing us to examine cells and their interactions in a more biomimetic context. Modern biomedical research has at its disposal novel technological approaches that promote development of more sophisticated and robust tissue engineering in vitro models, including scaffold- or hydrogel-based formats, organotypic cultures, and organs-on-chips. Even though such systems are necessarily simplified to capture a particular range of physiology, their ability to model specific processes of human biology is greatly valued for their potential to close the gap between conventional animal studies and human (patho-) physiology. Here, we review recent advances in 3D biomimetic cultures, focusing on the technological bricks available to develop more physiologically relevant in vitro models of human tissues. By highlighting applications and examples of several physiological and disease models, we identify the limitations and challenges which the field needs to address in order to more effectively incorporate synthetic biomimetic culture platforms into biomedical research.","Moysidou, Chrysanthi-Maria; Barberio, Chiara; Owens, Róisín Meabh",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,55,1

By using the data of centre for monitoring Indian economy (CMIE)’s consumer pyramids household survey (CPHS), the paper analyses the magnitude and nature of job losses and consequent unprecedented rise in unemployment across gender, social group, occupations during April–June 2020. It finds widespread job losses in labour market with some sections of the society, including small traders, self-employed, migrant workers, daily wage labourers, youth and women being worst affected, who mostly work in the informal sector of the Indian economy. Agriculture sector acted as a sponge by absorbing surplus labour during the times of COVID-19, which was being gradually vacated earlier over the years due to several well-known reasons. The rate of recovery in labour market has been comparatively much slower in case of salaried jobs, youth employment, particularly in rural areas and with elementary education. The economic consequences such disruptions on employment front were even much more serious as a very low percentage of households reporting improvement in their incomes. The most worrying aspect is that though the return to normalcy may take some time, there has been general recessionary trends in employment in India, which have been visible much before the COVID-19 crisis. The policy measures need to be extraordinary in such difficult times, focusing on securing employment and welfare of affected workers through sound and effective social protection programmes along with a major drive for promoting labour-intensive economic activities such as micro- and small enterprises, extension of employment security to poor urban households and skilling/reskilling of labour force to work in post-COVID-changed situations.","Mamgain, Rajendra P.",J,55,1

In this setting, heart failure units have faced an enormous challenge: taking care of their patients while at the same time avoiding patients' visits to the hospital. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of a follow-up protocol established in an advanced heart failure unit at a single center in Spain during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: During March and April 2020, a protocolized approach was implemented in our unit to reduce the number of outpatient visits and hospital admissions throughout the maximum COVID-19 spread period. We compared emergency room (ER) visits, hospital admissions, and mortality with those of January and February 2020. RESULTS: When compared to the preceding months, during the COVID pandemic there was a 56.5% reduction in the ER visits and a 46.9% reduction in hospital admissions, without an increase in mortality (9 patients died in both time periods). A total of 18 patients required a visit to the outpatient clinic for decompensation of heart failure or others. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that implementing an active-surveillance protocol in acutely decompensated heart failure units during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can reduce hospital admissions, ER visits and, potentially, viral transmission, in a cohort of especially vulnerable patients.","López-Miro-Espinosa, Flavio",,55,16

This paper provides the most comprehensive assessment to date of these issues, focusing primarily on developing economies. It shows that policy reach has been limited, especially for more vulnerable firms and countries, and identifies mismatches between policies provided and policies most sought. It also provides some indicative evidence regarding mistargeting of policies and their effectiveness in addressing liquidity constraints and preventing layoffs. This assessment provides some early guidance to policymakers on tailoring their COVID-19 business support packages and points to new directions in data and research efforts needed to guide policy responses to the current pandemic and future crises.","Cirera, Xavier; Cruz, Marcio; Davies, Elwyn; Grover, Arti; Iacovone, Leonardo; Cordova, Jose Ernesto Lopez; Medvedev, Denis; Maduko, Franklin Okechukwu; Nayyar, Gaurav; Reyes Ortega, Santiago; Torres, Jesica",World Bank Res Obs,55,10

The app was designed to recognize the user’s hand touching the images with the rear camera and provide voice guidance with the information on the images that the index finger is touching as a trigger. When performing gestures with either the index finger or thumb, the app was able to detect and output the fingertip point without delay, and it was effective as a trigger for reading. Thumb gestures are assumed to have reduced detection variances of 68% in the lateral direction because they rarely move the other four fingers compared to index finger gestures. By performing multiple detections in the application and outputting the median, the variances of detection can be reduced to 73% in the lateral direction and 70% in the longitudinal direction, which shows the effectiveness of multiple detections. These techniques are effective in reducing the variance of fingertip detection. We also confirmed that if the tilt of the device is between −3.4 mm and 4 mm, the current app could identify a 12 mm difference with an accuracy of 85.5% as an average in both of the lateral and longitudinal directions.

In this chapter I am concerned with various complex processes pertaining to tourism and of adventure tourism in particular. First, I am concerned with the circulation of people as both tourists and transnational migrant workers in two global adventure meccas since these two distinct groups of people are currently considered to be the largest groups traversing the world to date, but for very different socioeconomic and political reasons. Second, I am interested in the ways in which places are experienced, performed and sold, and thus adopt a performative approach to place in my discussion of place-making practices. Third, I am interested in the semiotic industry of tourism and the commodification of adventure both online and offline, where thrill, risk and safety of “embodied challenges” are bottled up, packaged and sold linguistically, visually and thus semiotically, where individuals’ identities and bodies are reassessed and imbued with cultural, social and network capital. Fourth, I am interested in current theories of mobility that epistemologically question the boundaries and breakdown between labor, migration and leisure happening in contemporary times where the circulation of individuals, material and symbolic resources are taking place at rapid speeds. This discussion centers around places of play where a kind of post-precariat workforce has emerged as a result of distinct labor and immigration policies that have been created in order to both facilitate and block movement of people between certain nation-states in order to remain competitive within the global new economy. How mobility is theoretically being accounted for and empirically captured in postmodern times does not only pertain to the participants of this study and my discussion of adventure tourism hubs, but also to me as a researcher and the methodological approach taken in this study, which is one of a global, multi-sited and mobile ethnography. Engaging in this type of method means that the research being carried out is inevitably epistemologically linked with mobility, and contributes to the existing literature on the sociolinguistics of tourism.","Gonçalves, Kellie","Labour Policies, Language Use and the &#x02018;New&#x02019; Economy",55,1

Nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and three nitro-PAHs (NPAHs) in PM(2.5) were detected via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The PAHs concentration in summer and winter decreased from 6.37 ± 1.30 ng/m(3) and 96.9 ± 69.9 ng/m(3) to 4.89 ± 2.67 ng/m(3) and 49.8 ± 43.4 ng/m(3) from 2015 to 2017. NPAHs decreased in winter (from 1707 ± 708 pg/m(3) to 1192 ± 1113 pg/m(3)), but increased in summer from 2015 (336 ± 77.2 pg/m(3)) to 2017 (456 ± 312 pg/m(3)). Diagnostic ratios of PAHs indicated that petroleum combustion was the main emission source in summer, and pollutants originating from the combustion of petroleum, coal and biomass dominated in winter. The 2-nitrofluoranthene (2-NFR)/2-nitropyrene (2-NP) ratio in this study demonstrated that the OH radical pathway was the main pathway for the formation of 2-NP and 2-NFR. The mean total benzo[a]pyrene-equivalent concentrations (BaP(eq)) and incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) values decreased from 2013 to 2017. The high value of total BaPeq in the winter of 2017 in Xinxiang revealed that a high-risk of cancer remained for residents. The results of this study demonstrate that the decreases in PAHs and NPAHS concentrations from 2015 to 2017. Combined with reducing gaseous pollutants concentration, the reduction in this study might be attributable to emissions reductions by implementing the air pollution control regulations in Xinxiang city in 2016.","Zhang, Hao; Yang, Lu; Zhang, Xuan; Xing, Wanli; Wang, Yan; Bai, Pengchu; Zhang, Lulu; Li, Ying; Hayakawa, Kazuichi; Toriba, Akira; Tang, Ning",Int J Environ Res Public Health,55,1

This illness was included in the list of neglected tropical diseases targeted for elimination by the World Health Organization. However, the increasing evidence of resistance to existing antimonial drugs has made the eradication of the disease difficult to achieve, thus warranting the search for new drug targets. We report here studies that used computational methods to identify inhibitors of receptors from natural products. The cell division cycle-2-related kinase 12 (CRK12) receptor is a plausible drug target against Leishmania donovani. This study modelled the 3D molecular structure of the L. donovani CRK12 (LdCRK12) and screened for small molecules with potential inhibitory activity from African flora. An integrated library of 7722 African natural product-derived compounds and known inhibitors were screened against the LdCRK12 using AutoDock Vina after performing energy minimization with GROMACS 2018. Four natural products, namely sesamin (NANPDB1649), methyl ellagic acid (NANPDB1406), stylopine (NANPDB2581), and sennecicannabine (NANPDB6446) were found to be potential LdCRK12 inhibitory molecules. The molecular docking studies revealed two compounds NANPDB1406 and NANPDB2581 with binding affinities of −9.5 and −9.2 kcal/mol, respectively, against LdCRK12 which were higher than those of the known inhibitors and drugs, including GSK3186899, amphotericin B, miltefosine, and paromomycin. All the four compounds were predicted to have inhibitory constant (Ki) values ranging from 0.108 to 0.587 μM. NANPDB2581, NANPDB1649 and NANPDB1406 were also predicted as antileishmanial with Pa and Pi values of 0.415 and 0.043, 0.391 and 0.052, and 0.351 and 0.071, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations coupled with molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) computations reinforced their good binding mechanisms. Most compounds were observed to bind in the ATP binding pocket of the kinase domain. Lys488 was predicted as a key residue critical for ligand binding in the ATP binding pocket of the LdCRK12. The molecules were pharmacologically profiled as druglike with inconsequential toxicity. The identified molecules have scaffolds that could form the backbone for fragment-based drug design of novel leishmanicides but warrant further studies to evaluate their therapeutic potential.","Broni, Emmanuel; Kwofie, Samuel K.; Asiedu, Seth O.; Miller, Whelton A.; Wilson, Michael D.",Biomolecules,55,1

The distribution of pricing errors obtained from AVMs generally show fat tails (Pender 2016; Demiroglu and James Management Science, 64(4), 1747–1760 2018). The extreme events on the tails are usually known as “black swans” (Taleb 2010) in finance and their existence complicates financial risk management, assessment, and regulation. We show via theory, Monte Carlo experiments, and an empirical example that a direct relation exists between non-normality of the pricing errors and goodness-of-fit of the house pricing models. Specifically, we provide an empirical example using US housing prices where we demonstrate an almost perfect linear relation between the estimated degrees-of-freedom for a Student’s t distribution and the goodness-of-fit of sophisticated evaluation models with spatial and spatialtemporal dependence.","Pace, R.

Studying under these conditions influences students’ motivation to complete and turn in course-related assignments, especially newly enrolled students taking the English reading online courses as second language learners (L2). The aim of this qualitative study is to examine various factors influencing Japanese college freshmen’s (n = 80) motivation when completing graded online assignments as part of asynchronous English reading courses held during the COVID-19 pandemic. The post-course survey of students from three separate classes was used to capture a detailed panorama of learner motivation. Results from an inductive content analysis of responses indicated that higher levels of motivation were strongly associated with assignments that facilitated learner autonomy, social interaction, personal interest, and practical utility of the task. Conversely, decreased motivation appears to be strongly associated with assignments reinforcing the perception of high difficulty, personal inefficacy, and cognitive overload. These findings are consistent with studies examining online learners’ motivation in the pre-pandemic period. This study found that intrinsic motivation plays an explicit role in enhancing learners’ engagement with instructional materials. Researchers recommend that, especially during emergencies such as a pandemic or major crisis, teachers should deliberately and extensively employ strategies to enhance the motivational appeal of instructional materials and assignments. When designing online assignments for freshman courses, special attention must be paid to psychological (autonomy, utility, relevance), cognitive (information overload), social (relatedness, interaction), and environmental (an emergency, uncertainty, isolation) conditions of learning.","Ismailov, Murod; Ono, Yuichi",Asia-Pacific Edu Res,55,1

The participants were 1147 adolescents aged between 12 and 18 years (male: n = 479; female: n = 668) who watched a 12 s animation representing the situation and filled out a questionnaire to analyze the legitimation of violent behaviors and anxiety levels. We registered their decisions to solve the situation using a categorical scale that included assertive, avoidant, aggressive, submissive, and supportive behaviors. Gender was not associated with the adolescent’s behaviors in facing a simulated peer aggression situation. However, male teenagers tended to perceive adults as sanctioners and neutrals; those who used the diffusion of responsibility and dehumanization to justify their behavior also showed a higher state of anxiety. Female teenagers who expected legitimation from their peers, presented higher anxiety as well. Educational interventions may use these results, helping adolescents to understand that their acts have substantial implications in the lives of others. It is essential to develop group interventions that modify how adolescents manage their conflicts and change gender stereotypes that significantly impact health. We highlight the need for linking families in educational programs facing the challenges of transforming the legitimization of violence in parental practices.","Martínez-González, Marina B.; Turizo-Palencia, Yamile; Arenas-Rivera, Claudia; Acuña-Rodríguez, Mónica; Gómez-López, Yeferson; Clemente-Suárez, Vicente J.",Brain Sci,55,1

Consenting patients are recruited during acute admission, with telephone follow up at day 30 and 90. We performed a retrospective review of all patients referred to a single general surgical unit with a symptomatic hernia to quantify recruitment rate and identify barriers to recruitment. METHODS: Patients meeting the inclusion criteria 1st August to 18th September were identified from prospective handover lists and electronic records and compared to the prospectively compiled screening log. Reason for not enrolment was coded according to protocol with an additional code added for patients not identified at time of admission. RESULTS: 8/23 (35%) eligible patients were enrolled. 15/23 (65%) were not enrolled due to; Patient not identified at time of admission n = 9 (60%), declined n = 2 (13.3%), too unwell to consent n = 2 (13.3%), translational barrier n = 1 (6.6%) and lacking capacity n = 1 (6.6%). Patients not identified at time of admission included those seen by clinicians not involved in study (new starters and locums) and those discharged directly from A&E with insufficient time and resources to gain consent. CONCLUSION: In our unit 65% of eligible patients were not recruited, the majority of whom were missed at time of presentation. This study will generate important information on management and outcomes of acute hernias however strategies are required to recognise and mitigate recruitment bias. Staff turnover may be a significant factor in prospective studies, particularly those prolonged during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wilkins, A; Findlay, A; Yau, J; Ettles, C; Findlay, Charles",BJS Open,55,16

Given the persistent urban–rural gap in technology adoption and usage, this study intends to understand factors motivating rural farmer’s adoption of social media marketing (SMM) tools in China. We contextualize and extend the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework to China’s agriculture sector. Specifically, we propose product SMM suitability as a new moderator based on the channel/product fit literature. The survey method is utilized to validate the proposed research model. Six follow-up interviews are analyzed to supplement the quantitative survey findings. While the result confirms UTAUT’s generalizability in China’s agriculture sector, it also demonstrates limited generational divide and gender divide in SMM adoption among Chinese farmers. More importantly, the newly proposed moderator, SMM product suitability, is empirically validated. Farmers consider non-grain products to be more suitable for SMM than grain products. SMM product suitability not only directly increases Chinese farmers’ SMM adoption intention, but also moderates the relationship between behavioral intention and use as well as the relationship between facilitating conditions and use.","Han, Honghua; Xiong, Jason; Zhao, Kexin",Inf Syst E-Bus Manage,55,1

Yet, not all youth and young adults (YYA) have adequate resources and many require assistance to overcome transition barriers including lack of social support, poverty, and homelessness. This study analyzed the policy design and social justice values (equity, equality, and adequacy) of three federal workforce programs, authorized by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), and designed to increase economic self-sufficiency among disconnected YYA. These programs lack stable and adequate funding and currently serve a small fraction of the YYA who could benefit. A value of equity is evident in the eligibility and financing criteria, while adequacy as it relates to programming—particularly benefits and services offered to address basic needs, economic stability, and healthy development—warrants further investigation. The programs’ focus on self-sufficiency through connection to education, training, and employment ignores research suggesting that at least six other dimensions are crucial for a successful transition to adulthood. Research on program entry and exit, primary services/benefits received, and life experiences of program participants is needed to determine current levels of support and the potential of these programs to enhance other components of a healthy transition including health, community engagement, and social support among disconnected YYA.

While lockdowns may be crucial for disease prevention and control, they also disrupt food systems and economic activity and may have devastating impacts on vulnerable households. This study uses longitudinal data to examine trends in household food insecurity in Nigeria just after lockdowns were imposed and at multiple points later in 2020, and assesses the impacts of lockdowns in spring 2020 on household food insecurity. METHODS: This study utilizes data from the Nigerian General Household Survey 2018/19 and the first seven rounds of the LSMS-ISA National Longitudinal Panel Survey on COVID-19 collected between April-November 2020. We assess trends in household food insecurity, as measured by the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and use a difference-in-difference design to estimate the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on household food insecurity. RESULTS: Household food insecurity in Nigeria increased significantly between Jan/Feb 2019 and the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in April/May 2020. As the pandemic continued, food insecurity decreased between April/May and November of 2020 for all items in the FIES yet remained significantly higher than before the pandemic began. Difference-in-difference models, however, suggest that the lockdowns that were imposed in some Nigerian states did not significantly increase household food insecurity. CONCLUSIONS: When lockdowns were imposed in response to COVID-19 outbreaks in early 2020, many researchers and policymakers worried that households in low- and middle-income countries, many of which rely on informal work and/or daily wages for their livelihoods, would be vulnerable to food insecurity and hunger. Still, lockdowns are a key public health strategy for slowing the spread of infectious disease. As we continue to address COVID-19 and prepare for new emerging infectious diseases, we must weigh the risks and benefits strategies such as lockdowns. These results will help policymakers understand how measures to prevent and control COVID-19 influence livelihoods during a prolonged public health crisis.

However, the actual risks are not fully described, neither are the appropriate adjustments needed to mitigate such risks. METHODS: Nation-wide registry was set up by Israeli IBD Section, to characterize course of COVID-19 in IBD patients who contacted SARS-CoV-2 infection while on biologics. We prospectively collected demographic and clinical data, and analyzed COVID-19 outcomes with regard to the specific treatments. RESULTS: Between Apr and Oct 2020, 144 patients with an established IBD diagnosis and confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled at 20 IBD referral centers. The majority of patients was under the age of 40 (113, 78%), 9 (6%) were younger than 18, only 4 patients (3%) over the age of 70. 94 patients received biologics, as monotherapy (76, 52.8%), combined with immunomodulators (9, 10%) or concomitant corticosteroids (9, 10%). 37 patients (26%) were reported with moderate and severe COVID-19 course, third of them (13) on biologics. 24 patents (17%) were admitted for hospitalization, the rest managed in home setting (114, 79%) and hotels converted into makeshift healthcare facilities (6, 4%). Fifteen patients (10%) required non-invasive ventilation and oxygen support, 3 patients (2%) went on mechanical ventilation. All patients recovered uneventfully, with no mortalities reported. Age was the most significant factor associated with moderate and severe disease. We found no correlation between bowel disease activity and the severity of COVID-19 course. The rate of serious COVID-19 for the 94 patients who had received biologics was significantly lower than that of 50 patients who were not treated with biologics (13/94 vs 24/50; RR 0.29 [95% CI, 0.161–0.515]; p < 0.0001). On adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, IBD phenotype and activity, the surprising ameliorating effect associated with biologics was profound and significant (OR, 0.082 [95% CI 0.009-0.621], p =0.013) in all age categories. CONCLUSION: Our results are reassuring and encouraging, and do not suggest that therapeutic immune suppression renders IBD patients particularly vulnerable for more severe course of the COVID-19. Adjusted odds for severe COVID-19 course actually decreased significantly in patients treated with biologics. It could be speculated that cytokine inhibition may mitigate progression of the infection to a devastating hyperinflammatory state. Continuing necessary maintenance immune suppression seems to be appropriate and safe approach, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lichtenstein, L; Koslowsky, B; Avni-Biron, I; Ovadia, B; Ben-Bassat, O; Naftali, T; Kopylov, U; Haberman, Y; Banai Eran, H; Eliakim, R; Lahat-Zok, A; Hirsch, A; Zittan, E; Maharshak, N; Waterman, M; Israeli, E; Goren, I; Ollech, J E; Yanai, H; Ungar, B; Avidan, B; Ben Hur, D; Melamud, B; Segol, O; Shalem, Z; Dotan, I; Odes, S H; Ben-Horin, S; Snir, Y; Milgrom, Y; Broide, E; Goldin, E; Delgado, S; Ron, Y; Cohen, N A; Maoz, E; Zborovski, M; Odeh, S; Abu Freha, N; Bar-Gil Shitrit, A",J Crohns Colitis,55,1

We conducted two studies and attempted to discover if a discrepancy exists between the lenders' preferences and the platforms’ incentives. In the first study, we conducted a conjoint analysis to examine the impact of lenders' decisions to invest through P2P platforms. The second study examines the factors in which platforms use to determine the lending interest rate for loans. We found that although lenders wish to decrease their risk and guarantee their investment, P2P companies encourage riskier borrowers. This contradiction between the priorities of the lenders and those of the platforms may explain why the non-users consider P2P lending to be a high risk. We offer several suggestions to increase the attractiveness of the Fintech and lending platforms industry.

The aim of this animal study was to measure the baseline values and kinetics of interleukin-6, procalcitonin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in healthy Landrace-Large White swine anesthetized with propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia. We included 8 healthy male pigs with an average weight of 19 ± 2 kg (aged 10-15 weeks) that were subjected to propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia for 8 hours. Complete blood count, serum chemistry, and serum levels of interleukin-6, procalcitonin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were analyzed, and serum levels were quantified hourly. Blood was also collected for bacterial culturing. Baseline values of interleukin-6 and procalcitonin were 18 pg/ml and 21 ng/ml, respectively, while tumor necrosis factor-alpha was not detectable during collection of baseline samples. A statistically significant difference was observed in interleukin-6 levels between time points (p < 0.0001). Procalcitonin increased with time, but there were no significant differences between time points (p = 0.152). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased until the 3rd hour of propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia, while after the 4th hour, it gradually decreased, reaching its baseline undetectable values by the 7th hour (p < 0.001). Our results can serve as the basis for further translational research.","Chalkias, Athanasios; Spyropoulos, Vaios; Georgiou, Georgia; Laou, Eleni; Koutsovasilis, Anastasios; Pantazopoulos, Ioannis; Kolonia, Konstantina; Vrakas, Spyros; Papalois, Apostolos; Demeridou, Styliani; Gourgoulianis, Konstantinos; Dontas, Ismene; Kaparos, George; Baka, Stavroula; Xanthos, Theodoros",Biomed Res Int,55,1

Each stage was characterized by certain demographic, economic, political, and other factors. These factors influence the formation of foreign labor migration at the macrolevel. The mentioned stages reflect (i) the transition from a planned to a market economy against the background of an increase in migration outflow for permanent residence in 1990–2000, (ii) acceleration of economic growth in 2000–2009 and the formation of “migrant networks” abroad, (iii) a period of slowdown in GDP growth in the absence of structural reforms to stimulate employment and investment in 2010–2015, which contributed to the active growth of labor migration, and (iv) a stage of new socioeconomic reforms and increased attention of the leadership of Uzbekistan to migration processes. This study takes into account these macroeconomic conditions, but focus is shifted to the reasons for the change in migration processes in terms of poorly understood sociocultural factors that affect foreign labor migration and reintegration of labor migrants in Uzbekistan. The article is based on reports from specialized studies of foreign labor migration and employment conducted by the Ministry of Employment and Labor Relations of Uzbekistan, publications of studies by international organizations, and data from in-depth interviews with migrants and their families. The research revealed that under the influence of macroeconomic conditions, the change in the sociocultural context in 2006–2019 contributed to expansion of the geography of migration flows from Uzbekistan, the emergence of such phenomena as the “feminization” of migration and its “rejuvenation” against the background of certain elements of egalitarianism in an initially patriarchal society. Studying the sociocultural context made it possible to assess the degree of “success” of migration, in terms of remigration and the ability of migrants to reintegrate into society upon returning home. It has been determined that the microcommunity in Uzbekistan, as a donor country of labor resources, has both stimulating and constraining effects on the transformation of migration processes.","Bondarenko, K.

Despite the apparent robust host immune responses, HCMV is capable of replicating, evading host defenses, and establishing latency throughout life by developing multiple immune-modulatory strategies. HCMV has coexisted with humans mounting various mechanisms to evade immune cells and effectively win the HCMV-immune system battle mainly through maintaining its viral genome, impairing HLA Class I and II molecule expression, evading from natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity, interfering with cellular signaling, inhibiting apoptosis, escaping complement attack, and stimulating immunosuppressive cytokines (immune tolerance). HCMV expresses several gene products that modulate the host immune response and promote modifications in non-coding RNA and regulatory proteins. These changes are linked to several complications, such as immunosenescence and malignant phenotypes leading to immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and oncomodulation. Hence, tumor survival is promoted by affecting cellular proliferation and survival, invasion, immune evasion, immunosuppression, and giving rise to angiogenic factors. Viewing HCMV-induced evasion mechanisms will play a principal role in developing novel adapted therapeutic approaches against HCMV, especially since immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer therapeutic strategies. Since tumors acquire immune evasion strategies, anti-tumor immunity could be prominently triggered by multimodal strategies to induce, on one side, immunogenic tumor apoptosis and to actively oppose the immune suppressive microenvironment, on the other side.","El Baba, Ranim; Herbein, Georges",Front Immunol,55,1

Based on the spectral approach, we propose seven portfolio structures and evaluate them through a comparison with the conventional DCC-GARCH method and the most best 10 portfolios constructed by using wavelet approach. The main results show that the spectral-based approach outperforms the DCC-GARCH and the wavelet methods. In fact, the optimal gold-stock composition depends on the spectral density of each stock market index, where a stock market index with a stable spectral density requires more investments in gold than a stock market index with an unstable spectral density.","Ourir, Awatef; Bouri, Elie; Essaadi, Essahbi",Comput Econ,55,1

Upper and lower airway involvement is characteristic in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and can sometimes represent the initial or in some instances the sole manifestation. The objective of this review is to summarize the various clinical manifestations of localized disease in GPA and their treatment. RECENT FINDINGS Sinonasal disease is seen in up to 90% of patients. Otologic and ocular involvement is also commonly seen. Laryngeal and tracheal disease although less common is associated with significant morbidity and can be therapeutically challenging. Clinicians need to be aware of these localized GPA manifestations as they may be presenting disease features in the absence of other systemic findings. Treatment of localized GPA involves both immunosuppressive and surgical interventions for specific manifestations. Collaboration between specialists including rheumatologists, otolaryngologists, and ophthalmologists is often crucial to ensure optimal outcomes for patients. This is a narrative review that provides a comprehensive overview of localized granulomatosis with polyangiitis and current treatment options.","Sattui, Sebastian E; Lally, Lindsay",Current allergy and asthma reports,55,1

For that reason, the need for adaptation during COVID-19 pandemic may have brought major problems to families with children with this pathology. AIM To explore how children with ASD and their parents experienced the social isolation during COVID-19 outbreak period. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We conducted an observational, cross-sectional and analytical study. We applied an anonymous questionnaire that included children's demographic and clinical characteristics, along with the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in different aspects of family's daily life. RESULTS Out of 99 questionnaires obtained, 43 were related to children with ASD and 56 to control group. Children with ASD predominantly had changes in behavior, while children from control group mostly found no changes. The majority of parents of ASD children reported a negative impact in emotion management against those in control group reporting mostly positive or no impact. Caregivers reported higher mean scores of anxiety levels in themselves than in their children. ASD children and their parents had higher levels of anxiety than healthy ones. In the group with ASD, children that did not maintain routines had higher mean levels of anxiety than children that maintained routines.

Hypertension has been widely reported to be associated with increase disease severity, however, other studies have reported different findings. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the association of hypertension and severe and fatal COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting the rate of hypertension in COVID-19 patients with severe or non-severe disease or among survivors and non-survivors. The obtained data was pooled into a meta-analysis to calculate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS Hypertension was associated with a nearly 2.5-fold significantly increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease (OR: 2.49 [95%CI: 1.98-3.12] I2=24%), as well as with a similarly significant higher risk of mortality (OR: 2.42 [95%CI: 1.51-3.90] I2=0%). In meta-regression, a significant correlation was observed with an increase in mean age of patients with severe COVID-19 associated with increased log odds of hypertension and severity (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS The results of this pooled analysis of the current scientific literature would suggest that hypertension may be associated with an up to 2.5-fold higher risk of severe and fatal COVID-19, especially among older individuals.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Wong, Johnny; Henry, Brandon Michael",Polish archives of internal medicine,55,16

We use two balloon dilators (sphere and kidney type) to dissect the preperitoneal space for the TEP repair. It may be difficult to obtain exposure in patients who previously underwent lower abdominal surgery, because of adhesions to the abdominal wall. We reviewed our experience with inguinal hernia repairs to retrospectively analyze factors that limit the laparoscopic TEP approach. METHODS From 2006 to 2016, 313 patients (281 men and 32 women) underwent laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair at Yuki Hospital. The medical records of these patients were reviewed, and data for patients who previously underwent lower abdominal surgery were analyzed. RESULTS Eighty-four patients previously underwent lower abdominal surgery including appendectomy (N = 23), inguinal hernia repair [N = 45; including contralateral TEP repair (N = 26), ipsilateral anterior approach (N = 11)], and laparotomy with a lower abdominal midline incision (N = 22). TEP repair was successfully completed in 75 patients (75/84; 89%) and the procedure changed in nine patients to an anterior approach (N = 5), or transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair (N = 4). The reasons for changing the procedure included difficulty to develop the operative field (N = 5), violation of the integrity of the peritoneal envelope (N = 2), and intraoperative bleeding (N = 2). Seven patients had a contralateral inguinal hernia after TEP repair. CONCLUSION The majority of patients with an inguinal hernia and previous lower abdominal surgery underwent successful laparoscopic TEP repair. There is no need to avoid the laparoscopic TEP approach, even in patients with a history of previous lower abdominal surgery. However, patients after TEP repair of a contralateral inguinal hernia may be at increased risk for peritoneal injury and the approach may need to be changed.","Zuiki, Toru; Ohki, Jun; Ochi, Masanori; Lefor, Alan Kawarai",Surgical endoscopy,55,24

An increasing number of viral species have been associated with gastroenteritis or have been found in stool samples as new molecular tools have been developed. In this work, a DNA microarray capable in theory of parallel detection of more than 100 viral species was developed and tested. Initial validation was done with 10 different virus species, and an additional 5 species were validated using clinical samples. Detection limits of 1 × 10(3) virus particles of Human adenovirus C (HAdV), Human astrovirus (HAstV), and group A Rotavirus (RV-A) were established. Furthermore, when exogenous RNA was added, the limit for RV-A detection decreased by one log. In a small group of clinical samples from children with gastroenteritis (n = 76), the microarray detected at least one viral species in 92% of the samples. Single infection was identified in 63 samples (83%), and coinfection with more than one virus was identified in 7 samples (9%). The most abundant virus species were RV-A (58%), followed by Anellovirus (15.8%), HAstV (6.6%), HAdV (5.3%), Norwalk virus (6.6%), Human enterovirus (HEV) (9.2%), Human parechovirus (1.3%), Sapporo virus (1.3%), and Human bocavirus (1.3%). To further test the specificity and sensitivity of the microarray, the results were verified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) detection of 5 gastrointestinal viruses. The RT-PCR assay detected a virus in 59 samples (78%). The microarray showed good performance for detection of RV-A, HAstV, and calicivirus, while the sensitivity for HAdV and HEV was low. Furthermore, some discrepancies in detection of mixed infections were observed and were addressed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of the viruses involved.

Several cancer risk management strategies exist to address this increased risk. Decisions about which risk management strategies to choose are complex, personal and multifactorial for these women. This scoping review will map evidence relevant to cancer risk management decision making in BRCA mutation carriers without a personal history of cancer. The objective is to identify and describe the features of patient decision aids that have been developed for BRCA mutation carriers. This information may be beneficial for designing new decision aids or adapting existing decision aids to support decision making in this population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This scoping review will be conducted according to the Joanna Briggs Institute's scoping review methodological framework. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist will be used for guidance. Studies on decision aids for women with a BRCA mutation who are unaffected by breast or ovarian cancer will be considered for inclusion. Five electronic databases will be searched (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science) with no restrictions applied for language or publication date. Studies for inclusion will be selected independently by two review authors. Data will be extracted using a predefined data extraction form. Findings will be presented in tabular form. A narrative description of the evidence will complement the tabulated results. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval for conducting this scoping review is not required as this study will involve secondary analysis of existing literature. Findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant conferences.","McGarrigle, Sarah A; Prizeman, Geraldine; Spillane, Carol; Byrne, Niamh; Drury, Amanda; Mockler, David; Connolly, Elizabeth M; Brady, Anne-Marie; Hanhauser, Yvonne P",BMJ open,55,7

We opted to determine rates and trends of CMV seroconversion in pregnant army personnel and isolate risk factors. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, all pregnancies of army personnel between 2009-2019 were evaluated (n=10,409) and all pregnancies with CMV laboratory records were included. Seroconversion rate was calculated overall and per year. Demographic and obstetrical characteristics were compared between exposed and unexposed women. Independent predictors of seroconversion were further investigated using logistic regression models. RESULTS CMV serology status was available in 7,665 pregnancies. Seroconversion was evident in 66 women (4.15%) of the seronegative pregnancies. Women in seroconversion group were significantly more likely to belong to a higher social class. In the regression models, adjusted for age, place of residence and education, higher parity (aOR = 2, p< 0.001) and residing in a central district (aOR = 2.67, p= 0.002) were significantly associated with seroconversion, CONCLUSION: Higher social class appears to be a significant risk factor for CMV seroconversion during pregnancy. Residing in a central district and higher parity appear to be independently associated with an increased risk for seroconversion during pregnancy among army personnel.","Zemer-Tov, Bar; Walfisch, Asnat; Schwartz, Naama; Meir, Hila; Kleitman, Vered",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,55,24

(send oxygen supplies).,14.957675,3.8774235,2021-06-02,"BACKGROUND Since the 1950s antipsychotic medication has been extensively used to treat people with chronic mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. These drugs, however, have also been associated with a wide range of adverse effects, including movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia (TD) - a problem often seen as repetitive involuntary movements around the mouth and face. Various strategies have been examined to reduce a person's cumulative exposure to antipsychotics. These strategies include dose reduction, intermittent dosing strategies such as drug holidays, and antipsychotic cessation. OBJECTIVES To determine whether a reduction or cessation of antipsychotic drugs is associated with a reduction in TD for people with schizophrenia (or other chronic mental illnesses) who have existing TD. Our secondary objective was to determine whether the use of specific antipsychotics for similar groups of people could be a treatment for TD that was already established. SEARCH METHODS We updated previous searches of Cochrane Schizophrenia's study-based Register of Trials including the registers of clinical trials (16 July 2015 and 26 April 2017). We searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We also contacted authors of trials for additional information. SELECTION CRITERIA We included reports if they assessed people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had established antipsychotic-induced TD, and had been randomly allocated to (a) antipsychotic maintenance versus antipsychotic cessation (placebo or no intervention), (b) antipsychotic maintenance versus antipsychotic reduction (including intermittent strategies), (c) specific antipsychotics for the treatment of TD versus placebo or no intervention, and (d) specific antipsychotics versus other antipsychotics or versus any other drugs for the treatment of TD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We independently extracted data from these trials and estimated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assumed that people who dropped out had no improvement. MAIN RESULTS We included 13 RCTs with 711 participants; eight of these studies were newly included in this 2017 update. One trial is ongoing.There was low-quality evidence of a clear difference on no clinically important improvement in TD favouring switch to risperidone compared with antipsychotic cessation (with placebo) (1 RCT, 42 people, RR 0.45 CI 0.23 to 0.89, low-quality evidence). Because evidence was of very low quality for antipsychotic dose reduction versus antipsychotic maintenance (2 RCTs, 17 people, RR 0.42 95% CI 0.17 to 1.04, very low-quality evidence), and for switch to a new antipsychotic versus switch to another new antipsychotic (5 comparisons, 5 RCTs, 140 people, no meta-analysis, effects for all comparisons equivocal), we are uncertain about these effects. There was low-quality evidence of a significant difference on extrapyramidal symptoms: use of antiparkinsonism medication favouring switch to quetiapine compared with switch to haloperidol (1 RCT, 45 people, RR 0.45 CI 0.21 to 0.96, low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference for switch to risperidone or haloperidol compared with antipsychotic cessation (with placebo) (RR 1 RCT, 48 people, RR 2.08 95% CI 0.74 to 5.86, low-quality evidence) and switch to risperidone compared with switch to haloperidol (RR 1 RCT, 37 people, RR 0.68 95% CI 0.34 to 1.35, very low-quality evidence).Trials also reported on secondary outcomes such as other TD symptom outcomes, other adverse events outcomes, mental state, and leaving the study early, but the quality of the evidence for all these outcomes was very low due mainly to small sample sizes, very wide 95% CIs, and risk of bias. No trials reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life, outcomes that we designated as being important to patients. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Limited data from small studies using antipsychotic reduction or specific antipsychotic drugs as treatments for TD did not provide any convincing evidence of the value of these approaches. There is a need for larger trials of a longer duration to fully investigate this area.","Bergman, Hanna; Rathbone, John; Agarwal, Vivek; Soares-Weiser, Karla",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,55,24

During 2 visits to each farm in March and September, 2010, observations were made on the environment, feed, and health management, followed by bulk milk testing, clinical evaluation, and breed assessment of each individual cow, and an evaluation of diseases and treatments reported within the period. Additional data were collected directly from the farmers through direct interviews. The number of lactating cows was, on average, 11 (range 5 to 19) in the ORG and 16 (range 7 to 42) in the CONV herds. The ORG herds presented a lower percentage of the Holstein breed; whereas CONV herds were predominantly Holstein, in the ORG herds, only 2 herds were 100% Holstein and the remaining herds were crosses of Holstein, Jersey, and Gir (Bos indicus) cattle. Milk production per cow was lower (10.2 vs. 15.1 ± 1.22 L/cow, respectively) in ORG than in the CONV farms. The ORG farms offered less concentrate feed than CONV farms and had better pasture management. Organic farmers reported using phytotherapic and homeopathic products, and pasture management as a strategy to keep infection levels of endo- and ectoparasites low, whereas CONV farmers regularly used anthelmintics and acaricides. Milk production was lower in ORG than in CONV farms, but cow health and condition scores were broadly similar, indicating that the with these strategies ORG farms were able to secure levels of animal welfare comparable with CONV farms while complying with organic regulation, although at the cost of lower cow productivity.","Honorato, L A; Machado Filho, L C P; Barbosa Silveira, I D; Hötzel, M J",Journal of dairy science,55,1

Even though damping mechanisms and causes are well-known, no simple, generally valid formula exists. Here, a simulation technique is shown that allows producing an optical model for any bending geometries of melt-spun polymer optical fibres. The developed model takes all relevant loss mechanisms into account, especially regarding the scattering losses at the interface of core and cladding as well as those of the cladding-air interface. The latter is caused by interfacial roughness for which experimental data have been obtained by atomic force microscopy measurements. To show the validity of the simulation, the model is compared to experimental results for several fibres and a variety of geometries. The variance between model and experimental data is low (S < 4.6%). The model not only contributes to improving the understanding of the optical properties of POFs, but it also has direct applicability to the design of photonic textile sensors for medicine, where the fibres are incorporated with small bending radii.","Lustermann, Birgit; Quandt, B Maike; Ulrich, Sebastian; Spano, Fabrizio; Rossi, René M; Boesel, Luciano F",Scientific reports,55,1

Addressing MCC in these settings has the potential to help vast numbers of people and also to inform planning for better-resourced areas. METHODS The Resource-Poor Settings panel developed five key question domains; defining the term resource poor and using the traditional phases of disaster (mitigation/preparedness/response/recovery), literature searches were conducted to identify evidence on which to answer the key questions in these areas. Given a lack of data upon which to develop evidence-based recommendations, expert-opinion suggestions were developed, and consensus was achieved using a modified Delphi process. RESULTS The five key questions were then separated as follows: definition, infrastructure and capacity building, resources, response, and reconstitution/recovery of host nation critical care capabilities and research. Addressing these questions led the panel to offer 33 suggestions. Because of the large number of suggestions, the results have been separated into two sections: part 1, Infrastructure/Capacity in this article, and part 2, Response/Recovery/Research in the accompanying article. CONCLUSIONS Lack of, or presence of, rudimentary ICU resources and limited capacity to enhance services further challenge resource-poor and constrained settings. Hence, capacity building entails preventative strategies and strengthening of primary health services. Assistance from other countries and organizations is needed to mount a surge response. Moreover, planning should include when to disengage and how the host nation can provide capacity beyond the mass casualty care event.","Geiling, James; Burkle, Frederick M; Amundson, Dennis; Dominguez-Cherit, Guillermo; Gomersall, Charles D; Lim, Matthew L; Luyckx, Valerie; Sarani, Babak; Uyeki, Timothy M; West, T Eoin; Christian, Michael D; Devereaux, Asha V; Dichter, Jeffrey R; Kissoon, Niranjan",Chest,55,17

Brooks.,15.078712,3.645898,2020,"BACKGROUND Trachyspermum ammi is one of the key medicinal plant species with many beneficial properties. Thymol is the most important substance in the essential oil of this plant. Thymol is a natural monoterpene phenol with high anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, and anti-oxidant properties. Thymol in the latest research has a significant impact on slowing the progression of cancer cells in human. In this research, embryos were employed as convenient explants for the fast and effectual regeneration and transformation of T. ammi. To regenerate this plant, Murashige and Skoog (MS) and Gamborg's B5 (B5) media were supplemented with diverse concentrations of plant growth regulators, such as 6-benzyladenine (BA), 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and kinetin (kin). Transgenic Trachyspermum ammi plants were also obtained using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and zygotic embryos explants. Moreover, two Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains (EHA101 and LBA4404) harboring pBI121-TPS2 were utilized for genetic transformation to Trachyspermum ammi. RESULTS According to the obtained results, the highest plant-regeneration frequency was obtained with B5 medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/l BA and 1 mg/l NAA. The integrated gene was also approved using the PCR reaction and the Southern blot method. Results also showed that the EHA101 strain outperformed another strain in inoculation time (30 s) and co-cultivation period (1 day) (transformation efficiency 19.29%). Furthermore, HPLC method demonstrated that the transformed plants contained a higher thymol level than non-transformed plants. CONCLUSIONS In this research, a fast protocol was introduced for the regeneration and transformation of Trachyspermum ammi, using zygotic embryo explants in 25-35 days. Our findings confirmed the increase in the thymol in the aerial part of Trachyspermum ammi. We further presented an efficacious technique for enhancing thymol content in Trachyspermum ammi using Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation system that can be beneficial in genetic transformation and other plant biotechnology techniques.","Nomani, Masoumeh; Tohidfar, Masoud","Journal, genetic engineering & biotechnology",55,12

Methods A prospective study was done on 66 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (males: 54.5%; mean age 70.1 ± 9.6 years) who were stratified into: moderate (n=36; 54.5%), severe (n=12; 18.2%), and critically ill (n=18; 27.3%). Besides clinical findings, a wide spectrum of laboratory parameters was monitored at admission and control during the first seven days of hospitalization and used to predict progression from non-severe to severe illness and to predict the final outcome. Results Critically ill patients showed a higher control value of white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, but lower lymphocyte count and O2 saturation. Patients with fatal outcome (23; 34.85%) showed a higher control value of neutrophil, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and lower lymphocyte and O2 saturation. Progression from moderate to severe or critical illness was predicted by increasing lactate dehydrogenase (95% CI 0.5803 to 0.8397;p=0.003729), increase in ferritin (95% CI 0.5288 to 0.8221;p=0.03248), and by drop in O2 saturation (95% CI 0.5498 to 0.8179;p=0.01168). A fatal outcome was predicted by increase in ferritin (95% CI 0.5059 to 0.8195;p=0.04985), as well as by drop in O2 saturation (95% CI 0.5916 to 0.8803; p=0.001861). Conclusion Increase in ferritin, and drop in O2 saturation could be the most important prognostic parameters for the development of more severe clinical illness and death in COVID-19 hospitalized patients.","Mustafić, Sehveta; Jusufović, Edin; Hukić, Fatima; Trnačević, Emir; Divković, Anja; Trnačević, Alma","Medicinski glasnik : official publication of the Medical Association of Zenica-Doboj Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina",55,17

Certain classes of pharmaceuticals, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are a major environmental concern due to their widespread use and the fact that these compounds are designed to have biological effects at low doses. A complication in predicting toxic effects of SSRIs in nontarget organisms is that their mechanism of action is not fully understood. To better understand the potential toxic effects of SSRIs, we employed an ultra-low input RNA-sequencing method to identify potential pathways that are affected by early exposure to two SSRIs (fluoxetine and paroxetine). We exposed wildtype zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to 100 μg/L of either fluoxetine or paroxetine for 6 days before extracting and sequencing mRNA from individual larval brains. Differential gene expression analysis identified 1550 genes that were significantly affected by SSRI exposure with a core set of 138 genes altered by both SSRIs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified 7 modules of genes whose expression patterns were significantly correlated with SSRI exposure. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes as well as network module genes repeatedly identified various terms associated with mitochondrial and neuronal structures, mitochondrial respiration, and neurodevelopmental processes. The enrichment of these terms indicates that toxic effects of SSRI exposure are likely caused by mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent neurodevelopmental effects. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to study the tissue-specific transcriptomic effects of SSRIs in developing zebrafish, providing specific, high resolution molecular data regarding the sublethal effects of SSRI exposure.","Huang, Irvin J; Dheilly, Nolwenn M; Sirotkin, Howard I; McElroy, Anne E",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,55,1

This study aimed to assess the attitudes and perceptions of clinical medical and dental students in Lagos, Nigeria, about volunteering during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Materials and Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted amongst medical and dental students undergoing clinical postings at the two public universities in Lagos, Nigeria, using total population sampling. Data were collected using a web-based questionnaire and analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to test for association at the level of significance of 5%. Results The mean age of the respondents was 23.3 years ± 2.6 standard deviation and 62.5% were females. The majority (82.9%) of the respondents agreed to volunteer if provided with adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and if adequately trained to do so (79.3%). Although perceived as dangerous, the majority (91.2%) of the respondents considered volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic as a form of educational experience. Compared to the final-year students, penultimate year students were more likely to volunteer in the event of a health manpower shortage. The final-year students were more likely to volunteer if government made the request. Female students were more likely than male students to volunteer even if they were not compensated but would require parental approval. Conclusion Medical and dental students perceived their involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic as a form of educational experience but would require adequate training and PPE. There is a need to train and provide adequate PPE for them to function as volunteers.","Adejimi, Adebola Afolake; Odugbemi, Babatunde Adeniran; Odukoya, Oluwakemi Ololade; Okunade, Kehinde Sharafadeen; Taiwo, Aminah Oluwatamilore; Osibogun, Akin",The Nigerian postgraduate medical journal,55,5

Photoplethysmography (PPG) can reflect changes in intravascular volume and thus can be used to assess vasomotor tone and arterial stiffness on the pressure-volume relation. We investigated whether a beat-to-beat analysis of the arterial pressure-PPG relationship can estimate dynamic changes in vascular characteristics immediately after liver graft reperfusion.In 10 recipients, arterial blood pressure and PPG waveforms recorded simultaneously were analyzed from the beginning of fall to nadir in systolic blood pressure immediately after reperfusion. On a beat-to-beat basis, we compared the ratio of the amplitude of PPG to arterial pulse pressure (PPGamp/PP, as relative vascular compliance) to total peripheral resistance (TPR) and Windkessel compliance (Cwk) obtained from the Modelflow CO algorithm.Following graft reperfusion, PPGamp/PP and Cwk increased (median 41.5%; P = .005 and 42.0%; P < .001, respectively), whereas TPR decreased (median -46.4%; P < .001). Beat-to-beat PPGamp/PP was negatively correlated with TPR (median r = -0.80 [95% CI -0.85 to -0.76] on linear regression and r = 0.84 [95% CI 0.73-0.92] on curvilinear regression), and was positively correlated with Cwk (median r = 0.86 [95% CI 0.81-0.91] on linear regression and r = 0.88 [95% CI 0.75-0.96] on curvilinear regression).Our results suggest that relative compliance, obtained from beat-to-beat analysis of PPG and arterial pressure waveforms, can track abrupt changes in vascular characteristics associated with postreperfusion syndrome.

The report emphasized the need for individualized, multimodal, and multidisciplinary approaches to pain management that decrease the over-reliance on opioids, increase access to care, and promote widespread education on pain and substance use disorders. The Task Force specifically called on specialty organizations to work together to develop evidence-based guidelines. In response to this report's recommendations, a consortium of 14 professional healthcare societies committed to a 2-year project to advance pain management for the surgical patient and improve opioid safety. The modified Delphi process included two rounds of electronic voting and culminated in a live virtual event in February 2021, during which seven common guiding principles were established for acute perioperative pain management. These principles should help to inform local action and future development of clinical practice recommendations.","Mariano, Edward R; Dickerson, David M; Szokol, Joseph W; Harned, Michael; Mueller, Jeffrey T; Philip, Beverly K; Baratta, Jaime L; Gulur, Padma; Robles, Jennifer; Schroeder, Kristopher M; Wyatt, Karla E K; Schwalb, Jason M; Schwenk, Eric S; Wardhan, Richa; Kim, Todd S; Higdon, Kent K; Krishnan, Deepak G; Shilling, Ashley M; Schwartz, Gary; Wiechmann, Lisa; Doan, Lisa V; Elkassabany, Nabil M; Yang, Stephen C; Muse, Iyabo O; Eloy, Jean D; Mehta, Vikas; Shah, Shalini; Johnson, Rebecca L; Englesbe, Michael J; Kallen, Amanda; Mukkamala, S Bobby; Walton, Ashley; Buvanendran, Asokumar",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,55,1

METHODS An online survey of women having health care appointments in the outpatient facilities across all divisions of a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at a tertiary care referral center in North Central Florida. Patients had outpatient appointments that were scheduled, canceled or rescheduled, in person or by telemedicine, between 11 March 2020 and 11 May 2020, a time during which a COVID-19 stay-at-home order was enacted across our state. A total of 6,697 visits were planned. Patients with multiple visits were unified, leaving 6,044 unique patients to whom the survey was emailed between 20 July 2020 and 31 July 2020. The survey was closed on 21 August 2020. Analyses were focused on simple descriptive statistics to assess frequency of responses. Analyses of variance and chi-square analyses were conducted to compare outcomes when all cells were ≥ 10, based on sub-specialty and insurance status; otherwise, frequencies were examined for the entire sample only. Missing data were excluded listwise. RESULTS A total of 6044 patients were contacted. Completed surveys numbered 1,083 yielding a response rate of 17.9%. The most common sub-specialty visit was gynecology (56.7%) followed by obstetrics (31.5%,), pelvic floor disorders (4.8%), gynecological oncology (2.9%,), and reproductive endocrinology (0.5%). A substantial percentage of women had visits canceled (19.2%), rescheduled (32.8%) or changed (42.1%) to telemedicine. In our patient population, 32.6% were worried about visiting the clinic and 48.1% were worried about visiting the hospital. COVID-19 triggered changes were perceived to have a negative impact by 26.1% of respondents. Refusal of future telemedicine visits was by 17.2%, however, 75.2% would prefer to use both in-person and telemedicine visits. CONCLUSION During the initial COVID-19 surge with lockdown, the majority of survey respondents were following public health precautions. However, there were significant concerns amongst women related to obstetric and gynecologic medical appointments scheduled during that period. During pandemics, natural disasters and similar extreme circumstances, digital communication and telemedicine have the potential to play a critical role in providing reassurance and care. Nevertheless, given the concerns expressed by survey respondents, communication and messaging tools are needed to increase comfort and ensure equity with the rapidly changing methods of care delivery.","Abu-Rutum, Reem S; Bright, Melissa; Moawad, Nash; Webur-LeBrun, Emily; Roussos-Ross, Kay; Christman, Gregory; Rhoton-Vlasak, Alice; Smulian, John C","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",55,12

While short-term feasibility has been described, long-term assessment of this method is currently outstanding. The aim of this study was to assess long-term parietal complications of this technique. METHODS In this retrospective study, patients operated between 2011 and 2013 were evaluated. Parietal incision was assessed with ultrasonography and patients screened for residual pain from scar tissue. Demographic and perioperative data were also collected. RESULTS We evaluated 48 patients [38 female, 79.2%; median age 49 years (range: 24-81 years)]; mean BMI 25.9 kg/m2 [±SD 4.1 kg/m2]. After a median follow-up of 39 months (range: 25-46 months), six incisional hernias (two patients had a positive echography but a negative clinical examination) were found (12.5%, 95% CI 7.5-30.2), and two patients had a surgical repair. The overall rate of incisional hernia was 16.7% (95% CI 7.5-30.2). Residual pain was observed in 5 of 48 patients. CONCLUSION This preliminary study suggests that a clinically significant rate of incisional hernias can occur after R-LESS-C.

In addition, we assessed demographic data, clinical features, laboratory abnormalities, underlying conditions, treatments, and outcomes. Patients with severe MIS-C who were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) between September 01 and October 05, 2020 were included in this observational, descriptive, retrospective study. The data collected included the patients' demographic data, presenting symptoms, clinical features, laboratory parameters, diagnostic investigations, and medications. Of 27 children with MIS-C, 63 % were male. The median age of the patients was nine years. Intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids were used for treatment in 100 % of the patients, anakinra in 51.8 %, vasopressors in 85.1 %, noninvasive mechanical ventilation in 25.9 %, and invasive mechanical ventilation in 18.5 %. Ten of the 27 patients (37 %) underwent TPE. In the patients who underwent TPE, the median PELOD score was 21 (IQR: 11-30.25) before TPE and 10 (IQR: 10-11) after TPE (p < 0.001). Moreover, their median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 52 % (IQR: 49.25 %-55 %) before TPE and median LVEF was 66.5 (IQR: 58 %-68.5 %) after TPE (p = 0.012). The median number of TPE sessions was three (IQR: 2-4.75). The mortality rate of the patients with severe MIS-C admitted to the PICU was 7.4 %. We suggest that TPE should be considered as a therapeutic option in children with severe MIS-C. Early initiation of TPE followed by immunomodulatory therapy in critically ill children with MIS-C may help improve clinical and laboratory outcomes.","Emeksiz, Serhat; Özcan, Serhan; Perk, Oktay; Uyar, Emel; Çelikel Acar, Banu; Kibar Gül, Ayşe Esin; Özkaya Parlakay, Aslınur; Özbek, Namık; Ekici Tekin, Zahide; Coşkun, Serkan; Aydın, Fatma; Çelikel, Elif; Kavurt, Ahmet Vedat; Ece, İbrahim; Ok Bozkaya, İkbal; Ertürk, Ahmet; Güney, Doğus; Şenel, Emrah",Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis,55,24

Egypt reported a low incidence of infection when compared with other countries. The aim of the study was to assess the characterization of COVID-19 infection among the Egyptian population. METHODOLOGY Data were collected from a single COVID-19 quarantine hospital in Cairo. A total number of 195 cases were included with their clinical, laboratory, and radiological data. RESULTS Three different age groups behaved differently for COVD-19 infection. The pediatric age group was asymptomatic entirely, the middle age group (18-50 years) were asymptomatic in 53.3% of cases, while 77.9% of those above 50 years were symptomatic (p ≤ 0.001). The latter group had a high incidence of COVID-pneumonia in (83.1%), and moderate to critical presentations were encountered in 66.3% of them. Neutrophil to lymphocyte (N/L) ratio correlated directly with the age and case severity. C-reactive protein (CRP) and computed tomography scan chest (CT-chest) had added value on COVID-19 diagnosis in suspected cases. CONCLUSIONS In Egypt, patients above 50 years are at a higher risk for symptomatic COVID-19 infection and leaner for moderate to critical COVID-19 presentation. The triad of CT-chest, CRP, and N/L ratio could be an integrated panel for assessing disease severity.","El Kassas, Mohamed; Asem, Noha; Abdelazeem, Amr; Madkour, Ahmad; Sayed, Hamdy; Tawheed, Ahmed; Al Shafie, Ahmed; Gamal, Mahmoud; Elsayed, Hassan; Badr, Mohamed; Hassany, Mohamed; Omran, Dalia; El Fouly, Amr",Journal of infection in developing countries,55,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed the records of 62 patients who underwent a single pRFA for solitary renal parenchymal tumor. We used the abbreviated Modified Diet for Renal Disease equation to calculate baseline, 1-month, and 1-year glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We defined normal as >60, moderately diminished as 45-60, and severely diminished GFR as <45 cc/minute/1.73 m². We used the Wilcoxon paired rank sum method to compare 1-month and 1-year GFR to baseline. We fit a linear regression model to test the association of lesion size to GFR controlling for lesion location and baseline GFR. RESULTS There was no difference in GFR from baseline at 1 month or 1 year (55 vs. 58 cc/minute/1.73 m², p=0.24 and 55 vs. 57 cc/minute/1.73 m², p=0.8, respectively). Tumor size did not affect GFR at 1 month or 1 year after controlling for lesion location and baseline GFR.

The aim of this study is to compare the absolute pre- and postoperative incidence of AF after minimally invasive surgical ablation for paroxysmal AF. METHODS Twenty consecutive patients (mean age 55 ± 8; 55% male) received a continuous loop monitor (CLM) 4 weeks prior to a minimally invasive pulmonary vein isolation (MIPVI). The mean preoperative AF burden was compared with the mean AF burden during follow-up. Follow-up was achieved for a period of 12 months. RESULTS Seventeen patients underwent an MIPVI successfully. Two patients did not reach the threshold for surgery. In 1 patient, surgery was discontinued because of a perioperative bleeding due to adhesions after a previous percutaneous AF ablation. Mean AF burden preoperatively was 66%. After 12 months, there was an absolute reduction in AF burden of 65% (95% CI 42-88, P < 0.001) and 12 of 15 patients in follow-up (80%) were free of AF without antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs). CONCLUSIONS The use of a CLM in the follow-up of surgical ablation is a very accurate way to confirm absolute surgical results. Furthermore, with the use of a CLM, preoperative evaluation can be done more accurately, and the surgical procedure can be adjusted to the patients' needs.","Oudeman, Maurice; Tjon, Andrew; Huijgen, Jos; Mijnen, Annet; de Ruiter, Gijsbert; Khan, Muchtiar; Eijkhout, Alex; Voogel, Albertus; Kuijper, Aaf; Lalezari, Shirin",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,55,5

The group of experts decided to perform a review of the literature to draw up a position statement that could be used in everyday practice. The group rated recommendations using the GRADE approach. All children over the age of 3 years should have their blood pressure measured annually. Due to the lack of data on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with blood pressure values, the definition of hypertension in children is a statistical value based on the normal distribution of blood pressure in the paediatric population, and children and adolescents are considered as having hypertension when their blood pressure is greater than or equal to the 95th percentile. Nevertheless, it is recommended to use normative blood pressure tables developed according to age, height and gender, to define hypertension. Measuring blood pressure in children can be technically challenging and several measurement methods are listed here. Regardless of the age of the child, it is recommended to carefully check for a secondary cause of hypertension as in 2/3 of cases it has a renal or cardiac origin.

This study aimed to understand changes in treatment providers' care during COVID-19, provider experiences with the adaptations, and perceptions of which changes should be sustained long-term. METHODS We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 20 New Jersey MOUD providers, purposively sampled to reflect diversity in provider setting, specialty, and other characteristics. Using a rapid analysis approach, we summarized content within interview domains and analyzed domains across participants for recurring concepts and themes. RESULTS MOUD treatment practice changes taking place during the COVID-19 pandemic included a rapid shift from in-person care to telehealth, reduction in frequency of toxicology testing and psychosocial/counseling services, and modifications to prescription durations and take-home methadone supplies. Modifications to practice were positively received and reinforced a sense of autonomy for providers as well as enhancing the ability to provide patient-centered care. All respondents expressed support for making temporary regulatory flexibilities permanent, but differed in their implementation of the flexibilities and the extent to which they planned to modify their own practices long-term. CONCLUSION Findings support sustaining temporary regulatory and payment changes to MOUD practice, which may have improved treatment access and allowed for more flexible, individually tailored patient care. Few negative, unintended consequences were reported by providers, but more research is needed to evaluate the patient experience with changes to practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Treitler, Peter C; Bowden, Cadence F; Lloyd, James; Enich, Michael; Nyaku, Amesika N; Crystal, Stephen",Journal of substance abuse treatment,55,26

METHODS AND RESULTS We analyzed data from 398,798 stroke patients admitted to 1613 Get With The Guidelines-Stroke participating hospitals between October 2011 and March 2014. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between combinations of racial/ethnic and sex groups with EMS use, adjusting for potential confounders including demographics, medical history, and stroke symptoms. Patients were 50% female, 69% white, 19% black, 8% Hispanic, 3% Asian, and 1% other, and 86% had ischemic stroke. Overall, 59% of stroke patients were transported to the hospital by EMS. White women were most likely to use EMS (62%); Hispanic men were least likely to use EMS (52%). After adjustment for patient characteristics, Hispanic and Asian men and women had 20% to 29% lower adjusted odds of using EMS versus their white counterparts; black women were less likely than white women to use EMS (odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.77). Patients with weakness or paresis, altered level of consciousness, and/or aphasia were significantly more likely to use EMS than patients without each symptom; the observed racial/ethnic and sex differences in EMS use remained significant after adjustment for stroke symptoms.

The University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine addressed this issue by forming a partnership with rural counties in northern Nevada to create a multicounty COVID-19 hotline clinical experience. Medical students staffed the hotline and assisted the underserved rural populations of northern Nevada by providing counseling and education via telehealth. With the support of preceptors, students completed screening forms with patients, utilized audio-only physical exam skills and clinical decision making to triage potential patients to the appropriate level of care. Methods We utilized retrospective pre- and postassessments to assess medical students' comfort level with several hotline tasks before and after their experience as a hotline volunteer. Results Results indicate significant improvements after hotline training and experience in students' comfort level with answering questions about SARS-CoV-2 (P=.006); screening patients for SARS-CoV-2 (P=.0446); assessing exam findings using audio only format ( P=.0429); triaging patients (P=.0103); and addressing financial access to care barriers ( P=.0127). Conclusion Participation in the multicounty COVID-19 hotline improved students' comfort levels in all areas, with significant improvement in answering questions about SARS-CoV-2, conducting audio-only exams, screening and triaging patients, and addressing financial barriers to care. Participation allowed students to further hone their clinical skills during a pandemic.

Methods: The family was from Puyang City, Henan Province, and had four members, including two with syndromic deafness. The proband and his sister had congenital deafness, and their parents had normal phenotypes. The clinical phenotype of the family was characterized using clinical examinations and pedigree analysis. The clinical examinations included imaging examination, audiometry (pure tone audiometry, acoustic immittance, brainstem auditory evoked potential, and otoacoustic emission), vestibular function test, and ophthalmic examination (visual acuity test, visual field test, fundus examination, visual evoked potential, and electroretinogram). Target exome sequencing of 129 known deafness genes and bioinformatics analysis were used to screen suspected pathogenic variants. Sanger sequencing and minigene assay were used to verify and functionally investigate the mutation detected, respectively. According to the standards and guidelines for interpreting genetic variants proposed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, the variants c.6049G>A and c.8699A>G were classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic, and the variant c.9856C>G was classified as variants of uncertain significance. Results: The probands and his sister had severe sensorineural hearing loss with decreased binocular vision, night blindness, decreased peripheral visual field sensitivity and partial visual field defect, and normal vestibular function. Both of them had three CDH23 mutations, including CDH23 (NM_022124.5) c.6049G>A (p.Gly2017Ser),c.9856C>G (p.His3286Asp), and c.8699A>G (p. Asp2900Gly), The first two were inherited from the father, and the last one was from the mother. The missense variants c.9856C>G and c.8699A>G were not included in the gnomad database. The missense mutation c.6049G>A was located in the last position of exon 46 and was predicted to affect splicing by bioinformatics software. The minigene experiment showed that the mutation cause exon skipping of exon 46, resulting in an abnormal protein. Conclusions: Compound heterozygous variations of the CDH23 are the leading cause of USH1D in the family. This study confirms that the compound heterozygosity of splicing and missense variants of the CDH23 gene could lead to USH1D.","Chen, B; Zhang, S; Tian, Y A; Liu, H F; Liu, D H; Xue, X; Li, R J; Hu, X X; Guan, J Y; Tang, W X; Xu, H E",Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery,55,13

Among 142 primarily evaluated patients with documented COVID-19, 110 patients (men/women, 63/47; mean age, 62.3 ± 15.3 years) met inclusion/exclusion criteria. More than 30 EchoCG parameters were analyzed, and baseline data (comorbidities, oxygen saturation, laboratory data, complications, outcomes, etc.) were evaluated. ROC-analysis was used for evaluating the diagnostic significance of different EchoCG parameters for prediction of a specific outcome and its probability. Dependence of the overall survival of patients on different EchoCG parameters was analyzed with the Cox proportional hazards model. For assessing the predictive value of EchoCG parameters for patient stratification by risk of an adverse outcome, a predictive model was developed using the CHAID method.Results The in-hospital death rate of patients included into the study was 15.5 %, and the death rate for this period of in-hospital observation was 12 %. Based on the single-factor analysis of EchoCG parameters, a multifactor model was developed using the method of Cox regression. The model included two predictors for an unfavorable outcome, estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (EPASP) and maximal indexed right atrial volume (RAi), and a preventive factor, right ventricular global longitudinal strain (LS RV). Base risks for fatal outcome were determined with an account of the follow-up time. According to the obtained values, an increase in EPASP by 1 mm Hg was associated with increases in the risk of fatal outcome by 8.6 % and in the RA(i) volume by 1 ml/5.8 %. LS RV demonstrated an inverse correlation; a 1% increase in LS RV was associated with a 13.4% decrease in the risk for an unfavorable outcome. According to the ROC analysis, the most significant determinants of the outcome were the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) (AUC, 0.84 ± 0.06; cut-off, 18 mm) and EPASP (AUC, 0.86 ± 0.05; cut-off, 42 mm Hg). Evaluating the effects of different EchoCG predictors, that characterized the condition of the right heart, provided a classification tree. Six final decisions were determined in the model, two of which were assigned to the category of reduced risk for fatal outcome and four were assigned to the category of increased risk. Sensitivity of the classification tree model was 94.1 % and specificity was 89.2 %. Overall diagnostic significance was 90.0±2.9 %.Conclusion The presented models for statistical treatment of EchoCG parameters reflect the requirement for a comprehensive analysis of EchoCG parameters based on a combination of standard methods for EchoCG evaluation and current technologies of noninvasive visualization. According to the study results, the new EchoCG marker, LS RV, allows identifying the signs of right ventricular dysfunction (particularly in combination with pulmonary hemodynamic indexes), may enhance the early risk stratification in patients with COVID-19, and help making clinical decisions for patients with different acute cardiorespiratory diseases.","Golukhova, E Z; Slivneva, I V; Rybka, M M; Mamalyga, M L; Marapov, D I; Klyuchnikov, I V; Antonova, D E; Dibin, D A",Kardiologiia,55,1

METHODS Patients who were planned to undergo lung resection surgery for lung tumors and needed OLV for at least 1 h were included in the study. After turning the patients into the lateral position under total intravenous anesthesia, OLV was commenced using a double-lumen endobronchial tube. EELV was measured using the nitrogen washout technique at 20 min after OLV started (baseline) and 15, 30, 45, 60 min after ARM was performed on the dependent lung. RESULTS Among 42 patients who completed the study, EELV increased at 15 min after ARM by 20% or greater compared with baseline in 21 patients (responders). Responders were significantly shorter in height (158 vs. 165 cm, p = 0.01) and had smaller preoperative functional residual capacity (2.99L vs. 3.65L, p = 0.02) than non-responders. Before ARM, responders had significantly higher driving pressure (14.2 vs. 12.4 cmH2O, p = 0.01) and lower respiratory system compliance (23.6 vs. 31.4 ml/cmH2O, p = 0.0002) than non-responders. Driving pressure temporarily dropped after ARM in responders, while no significant change was observed in non-responders. Fourteen out of 21 responders kept EELV 20% or more increased EELV than baseline at 60 min after ARM. CONCLUSION EELV of the dependent lung was increased by 20% or greater in half of the patients responding to ARM. The increased volume of the dependent lung caused by ARM was maintained for 60 min in two-thirds of the responders.","Miura, Yutaka; Ishikawa, Seiji; Nakazawa, Koichi; Okubo, Kenichi; Makita, Koshi",Journal of anesthesia,55,7

RECENT FINDINGS Several recent studies have shed light on the promising potential of AI in functional urology to investigate lower urinary tract dysfunction pathophysiology but also as a diagnostic tool by enhancing the existing evaluations such as dynamic magnetic resonance imaging or urodynamics. AI may also improve surgical education and training because of its automated performance metrics recording. By bringing prediction models, AI may also have strong therapeutic implications in the field of functional urology in the near future. AI may also be implemented in innovative devices such as e-bladder diary and electromechanical artificial urinary sphincter and could facilitate the development of remote medicine. SUMMARY Over the past decade, the enthusiasm for AI has been rising exponentially. Machine learning was well known, but the increasing power of processors and the amount of data available has provided the platform for deep learning tools to expand. Although the literature on the applications of AI technology in the field of functional urology is relatively sparse, its possible uses are countless especially in surgical training, imaging, urodynamics, and innovative devices.","Bentellis, Imad; Guérin, Sonia; Khene, Zine-Eddine; Khavari, Rose; Peyronnet, Benoit",Current opinion in urology,55,16

This article shows an endovascular reconstruction technique not yet described, using a telescoping self-expandable stent (LEO+) and flow-diverter device (SILK) at different surgical times. Two patients with circumferential fusiform aneurysm, one being an aneurysm of the segments P2 and P3 of the posterior cerebral artery, diagnosed after a headache, and the other a partially thrombosed aneurysm of the lower basilar artery, diagnosed following ischemia of the brain stem. Endovascular treatment was performed by means of a vascular reconstruction technique that used at different surgical times: overlapping; a telescoped self-expandable stent, LEO+; and a flow-diverter device, SILK. Angiographic control was carried out at 6 and 12 months, to evaluate arterial patency, flow maintenance in the arterial branches and perforating vessels, and thrombosis of the aneurysm. The combined use at different surgical times of the self-expandable stent and flow-diverter device was technically successful in both patients. There were no complications during the procedure, nor in the long-term follow-up with full arterial vascular reconstruction, maintenance of cerebral perfusion and complete aneurysm occlusion at the 6- and 12-month angiographic follow-up. There was no aneurysm recanalization nor intra-stent stenosis. Circumferential fusiform aneurysm of the posterior circulation involving arterial branches or perforating vessels to the brain stem may be treated with this arterial reconstruction technique at different surgical times, using the self-expandable stent called LEO+ and the flow-diverter device SILK, minimizing the risk of complications and failure of the endovascular technique, with the potential for arterial reconstruction with thrombosis of the aneurysmatic sac, as well as flow maintenance in the eloquent arteries, in this type of cerebral aneurysm.","de Andrade, Guilherme Cabral; Alves, Helvercio P; Clímaco, Valter; Pereira, Eduardo; Lesczynsky, Alexandre; Frudit, Michel E","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",55,1

By assessing student predictions of exam performance and analyzing themes from 276 student narrative surveys, we highlight the power of a careful balance between cognitive and social interventions to help students recover. Students in this study showed a 50% loss of efficacy beliefs after ERI (midsemester) but were able to improve to at least 75% above starting efficacy beliefs after instructor interventions. Thus, we also show how academic efficacy is highly malleable and is mediated in relationships. In turn, we demonstrate a new assessment model that uses student narrative writing to reveal ""invisible"" threats to students' perceptions of their capacity to succeed. Finally, we generalize from their findings to provide recommendations for effective strategies for supporting those students for whom every semester feels like a pandemic.","Camfield, Eileen Kogl; Schiller, NaTasha R; Land, Kirkwood M",CBE life sciences education,55,1

STUDY SELECTION Studies reporting aspects of burnout and CF among OTDCs, including risk and protective factors. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers independently screened the studies for eligibility and extracted data from chosen sources using a data extraction tool developed for this study; NVIVO was used to perform a qualitative directed content analysis. RESULTS The searches yielded 741 potentially relevant records, of which 29 met the inclusion criteria. The majority of articles were from the USA (n=7, 24%), Canada (n=6, 21%) and Brazil (n=6, 21%), published between 2013 and 2020 (n=13, 45%) in transplant journals (n=11, 38%) and used a qualitative design approach (n=12, 41%). In the thematic analysis, we classified the articles into five categories: (1) burnout characteristics, (2) CF characteristics, (3) coping strategies, (4) protective factors and (5) ambivalence. CONCLUSION We identified aspects of burnout and CF among OTDCs, including defining characteristics, demographic predispositions, protective factors, coping strategies, precursors, consequences and personal ambivalences. Researchers described burnout and CF characteristics but did not use consistent terms when referring to CF and burnout, which may have hindered the identification of all relevant sources. This gap should be addressed by the application of consistent terminology, systematic approaches and appropriate research methods that combine quantitative and qualitative investigation to examine the underlying reasons for the development of burnout and CF among OTDCs.","Silva E Silva, Vanessa; Hornby, Laura; Almost, Joan; Lotherington, Ken; Appleby, Amber; Silva, Amina Regina; Rochon, Andrea; Dhanani, Sonny",BMJ open,55,27

Even with a high failure rate, revisional procedures such as re-banding or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) were commonly performed. Recently, conversions of LAGB to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) were reported. We will review our experience on this conversion. METHODS Between February 2007 and January 2012, 800 patients underwent LSG, with 90 as a revisional procedure for failed LAGB. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed. Data were collected through routine follow-up and weight loss data were also obtained through self-reporting via the Internet. Demographics, complications, and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) were determined. RESULTS A total of 90 patients underwent LSG as a revisional procedure, comprising of 77 women and 13 men with a mean age of 41 years (22 to 67), a mean body mass index of 42 kg/m(2) (26 to 58). Among them, 15.5 % had diabetes mellitus, 35.5 % had hypertension, 20.0 % had hyperlipidemia, and 18.8 % had obstructive sleep apnea. The mean operative time was 112 min (50 to 220) and mean hospital stay was 4.2 days (1 to 180). Operative complications included 5.5 % leak and 4.4 % hemorrhage or gastric hematoma. There was no postoperative mortality. The mean postoperative %EWL was 51.8 % (n = 82), 61.3 % (n = 60), 61.6 % (n = 45), 53.0 % (n = 30), 55.3 % (n = 20), and 54.1 % (n = 10) at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS LSG after LAGB yields a positive outcome with higher complication rates than for primary LSG.

An acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an episode of acute respiratory worsening without an identifiable etiology. Occult viral infection has been proposed as a possible cause of acute exacerbation. OBJECTIVES To use unbiased genomics-based discovery methods to define the role of viruses in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS Bronchoalveolar lavage and serum from patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, stable disease, and acute lung injury were tested for viral nucleic acid using multiplex polymerase chain reaction, pan-viral microarray, and high-throughput cDNA sequencing. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Four of forty-three patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had evidence of common respiratory viral infection (parainfluenza [n = 1], rhinovirus [n = 2], coronavirus [n = 1]); no viruses were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage from stable patients. Pan-viral microarrays revealed additional evidence of viral infection (herpes simplex virus [n = 1], Epstein-Barr virus [n = 2], and torque teno virus [TTV] [n = 12]) in patients with acute exacerbation. TTV infection was significantly more common in patients with acute exacerbation than stable controls (P = 0.0003), but present in a similar percentage of acute lung injury controls. Deep sequencing of a subset of acute exacerbation cases confirmed the presence of TTV but did not identify additional viruses. CONCLUSIONS Viral infection was not detected in most cases of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. TTV was present in a significant minority of cases, and cases of acute lung injury; the clinical significance of this finding remains to be determined.","Wootton, Sharon Chao; Kim, Dong Soon; Kondoh, Yasuhiro; Chen, Eunice; Lee, Joyce S; Song, Jin Woo; Huh, Jin Won; Taniguchi, Hiroyuki; Chiu, Charles; Boushey, Homer; Lancaster, Lisa H; Wolters, Paul J; DeRisi, Joseph; Ganem, Don; Collard, Harold R",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,55,16

The efficacy and safety of riluzole vs placebo as an adjunct to antidepressant medication in outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) was examined in a 3-site, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trial using a sequential parallel comparison design comprised of two phases of 4 weeks. Patients with MDD in a current major depressive episode (N=104) with an inadequate response to either a prospective or a historical trial of an antidepressant medication were randomized in a 2 : 3 : 3 ratio to the treatment sequences of riluzole/riluzole, placebo/placebo, and placebo/riluzole, respectively. The primary outcome was change in depression severity, as assessed by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary efficacy outcomes included the response rate, defined as at least a 50% improvement in MADRS, Clinical Global Impressions severity and improvement subscales, and patient-reported measures of depression and cognitive function. Eighty-five patients completed the randomized treatment phases. Treatment groups did not differ in mean change in MADRS scores, response rate, or in any secondary efficacy outcomes. Riluzole was generally well tolerated, with a side effect profile consistent with its clinical use. In conclusion, a fixed dose of riluzole (100 mg/day) did not show adjunctive antidepressant efficacy compared to placebo. The trial was adequately powered to detect a moderate riluzole effect, and the risk for exaggerated placebo responses was mitigated. The lack of efficacy suggests that mechanisms underlying riluzole's neuroprotective effects are insufficient for clinical response in treatment-resistant depression.","Mathew, Sanjay J; Gueorguieva, Ralitza; Brandt, Cynthia; Fava, Maurizio; Sanacora, Gerard",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,55,20

METHODS Analysis of demographic data of participants obtained from the online registration collected. Comparison of the two congresses based on a survey with questions on the perception of speakers' performance, quality of networking, and other aspects. RESULTS Of 43,596 registered participants, 20,694 active participants attended the VC. Compared to 2019, the number of participants tripled (6916 in 2019) and the cumulated number of participants attending the sessions was five times higher (169,334 in 2020 vs 33,024 in 2019).

No specific therapy for any human coronavirus is available, making vaccine development critical for protection against these viruses. We previously showed that recombinant SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Urbani strain based) lacking envelope (E) protein expression (rU-ΔE) provided good but not perfect protection in young mice against challenge with virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15). To improve vaccine efficacy, we developed a second set of E-deleted vaccine candidates on an MA15 background (rMA15-ΔE). rMA15-ΔE is safe, causing no disease in 6-week-, 12-month-, or 18-month-old BALB/c mice. Immunization with this virus completely protected mice of three ages from lethal disease and effected more-rapid virus clearance. Compared to rU-ΔE, rMA15-ΔE immunization resulted in significantly greater neutralizing antibody and SARS-CoV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. After challenge, inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, and lung destruction were decreased in the lungs of rMA15-ΔE-immunized mice compared to those in rU-ΔE-immunized 12-month-old mice. Collectively, these results show that immunization with a species-adapted attenuated coronavirus lacking E protein expression is safe and provides optimal immunogenicity and long-term protection against challenge with lethal virus.

DESIGN AND METHOD This cross-sectional study included 377 midwives and nurses. RESULTS The prevalence of depression in midwives and nurses in our sample was 31.8%. In the logistic regression analysis, the risk of depression in midwives was 1.92 times higher than that of nurses. A high perceived stress score increased the risk of depression by 1.16 times, and a high emotional exhaustion score increased the risk of depression by 1.11 times. A high psychological resilience score was found to be protective against depression (<0.001).

Non-resonant PTIR images apparently provide rich details of the cell surface. However, we show that non-resonant image contrast does not arise from the infrared absorption of surface molecules and is instead dominated by the mechanics of tip-sample contact. In contrast, spectra and images of the cellular surface can be selectively obtained by tuning the pulsing structure of the laser to restrict thermal wave penetration to the surface layer. Resonant PTIR images reveal surface structures and domains that range in size from about 20 nm to 1 μm and are associated with the cytoplasmic membrane and its proximity. Resonant PTIR spectra of the cell surface are qualitatively comparable to far-field IR spectra and provide the first selective measurement of the IR absorption spectrum of the cellular membrane of an intact cell. In resonant PTIR images, signal intensity, and therefore contrast, can be ascribed to a variety of factors, including mechanical, thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of the cellular surface. While PTIR images are difficult to interpret in terms of spectroscopic absorption, they are easy to collect and provide unique contrast mechanisms without any exogenous labelling. As such they provide a new paradigm in cellular imaging and membrane biology and can be used to address a range of critical questions, from the nature of membrane lipid domains to the mechanism of pathogen infection of a host cell.","Quaroni, Luca",The Analyst,55,12

A growing body of evidence supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in several chronic neuropathic pain conditions; however, its role and efficacy remain unclear. Purpose To summarize current evidence for the mechanistic rationale of HBOT in chronic neuropathic pain conditions and to evaluate its clinical efficacy. Methods This narrative review was conducted after searching the following databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane, PsycINFO, the Web of Science, Scopus, ClinicalTrials. gov, WHO ICTRP, and ProQuest Digital Dissertation) from January 1946 to March 2020. Articles published in English that involved either animal or human studies with acute or chronic neuropathic pain evaluating any HBOT-related intervention were included. Results A total of 2971 citations were identified. A total of 29 studies were included in this review. The mechanisms of action for HBOT use in neuropathic conditions included the primary effects of hyperoxia and edema resolution, as well as the secondary effects pertinent to the production of oxygen and nitrogen reactive species (serving as pain signaling molecules), nitric oxide-dependent release of opioid peptides, and reduction of inflammatory mediators. A robust evidence for HBOT use in the clinical setting was associated with chronic regional pain syndrome and chronic primary bladder pain syndrome. Some evidence supported its use for chronic secondary (peripheral) neuropathic pain including radiation-induced plexus neuropathies, postherpetic neuralgia, and trigeminal neuralgia. Conclusions HBOT has been shown to have antinociceptive and analgesic effects in animal models of inflammatory, neuropathic, and chronic pain. Human studies demonstrated beneficial effects of HBOT in improving clinical outcomes such as pain scores, pain-related symptoms, and quality of life. A systematic methodology of HBOT application is necessary to confirm its safety and efficacy.","Schiavo, Simone; DeBacker, Julian; Djaiani, Carine; Bhatia, Anuj; Englesakis, Marina; Katznelson, Rita",Pain research & management,55,29

Vulnerable populations often have higher chances of developing severe illness from COVID-19 and the mortality rate is also higher. Thus, at-risk populations for COVID-19 request extra attention. The current study conducted a national online survey among vulnerable populations in China in early February 2020 to examine their engagement in coronavirus-related preventive health behaviors (e.g., frequent handwashing) and the potential determinants including factors from the Health Belief Model, trust in different media sources, and health literacy. The results suggested that the vulnerable populations' engagement in coronavirus-related preventive behaviors were significantly associated with barriers, benefits, self-efficacy, trust in doctors' social media, and trust in TV for COVID-19-related information. Besides, barriers, benefits, self-efficacy, trust in doctors' social media, and trust in TV mediated the effects of health literacy on preventive behaviors.

This research aimed to develop a conceptual disease model describing STGD symptoms and their impact on patients' lives. Material and Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients (juvenile and adult) and parents of children and adolescents with STGD. Interviewed subjects were enrolled through ophthalmologists from specialized eye centers in the USA and in France. Trained interviewers used semi-structured techniques to elicit concepts relevant to patients and their parents. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts led to the identification of concepts which were organized to generate a disease model. Results: A total of 21 patients (12 in the US; 9 in France) - 14 adults, 7 juveniles - and 7 parents were interviewed. The most cited ocular symptoms were photosensitivity and central vision decline. Interviewees reported limitations on Physical (e.g. difficulty with sports/physical activities), Mental (e.g. frustration and worry, reduced ability to concentrate), Social (e.g. issue with facial recognition and difficulty discussing disease) and Role (e.g. impact on driving and reading, difficulties at school/work) functioning. These impacts were, when possible, mitigated by coping strategies and support (e.g. using electronic devices, setting up routines or accepting the disease). Conclusions: This research provides an overview of symptoms experienced by patients with STGD and highlights the dramatic impact these have on patients' lives, allowing the identification of concepts of importance when evaluating new therapeutic options for STGD.","Roborel de Climens, Aude; Tugaut, Béatrice; Dias Barbosa, Carla; Buggage, Ronald; Brun-Strang, Catherine",Ophthalmic genetics,55,1

Given the relatively novelty of the disease, risk factors of mortality and adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients remain to be elucidated OBJECTIVE: To define independent risk factors predictive fo mortality, need for ICU care, and mechanical ventilation among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Large tertiary-care, academic university hospital PATIENTS: Adults admitted with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1-April 15, 2020 METHODS: Baseline clinical characteristics and admission laboratory variables were retrospectively collected. Patients were grouped based on mortality, need for ICU care, and mechanical ventilation. Prevalence of clinical co-morbidities and laboratory abnormalities were compared between groups using descriptive statistics. Univariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of mortality, ICU care and mechanical ventilation. Predictors significant at p≤0.10 were included in multivariate analysis. RESULTS 560 patients were included in the analysis. Age and myocardial injury were only independent predictors of mortality, in patients with/without baseline co-morbidities. BMI, elevated ferritin, elevated d-dimer, and elevated procalcitonin predicted need for ICU care, and these along with vascular disease at baseline predicted need for mechanical ventilation. LIMITATIONS All data were not available on each patient. Data on admission symptoms, vital signs, or imaging parameters were not collected. CONCLUSION Age and myocardial injury are the strongest independent predictors of mortality among patients admitted with COVID-19. Inflammatory markers seem to have value in predicting need for ICU care and mechanical ventilation, but not death. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS A multicenter, retrospective quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate provider response to CDS alerts triggered during ordering of QT-prolonging medications for adult patients. The primary outcome was the proportion of orders triggering QTc alerts that were continued without intervention during a specified preimplementation phase (n = 49) and during a postimplementation phase (n = 100). Patient risk factors for QTc prolongation, provider alert response, and interventions to reduce the risk of QTc-associated adverse events were evaluated. RESULTS The rate of order continuation without intervention was 82% in the preimplementation phase and 37% in the postimplementation phase, representing an 55% reduction in continued verified orders following implementation of the QT-focused CDS tool. Most alerts were initially responded to by the prescriber, with pharmacist intervention needed in only 33% of cases. There were no significant differences in patient QTc-related risk factors between the 2 study groups (P = 0.11); the postimplementation group had a higher proportion of patients using at least 2 QTc-prolonging medications (48%, compared to 26% in the preimplementation group; P = 0.02).

We examined laboratory anaerobic cultures of AD sludge from two sources amended with food waste, xylose, and xylan at mesophilic temperatures, and with cellulose at meso- and thermophilic temperatures, to determine whether and how the inoculum and substrate affect biogas yield and community composition. All substrate and inoculum combinations yielded methane, with food waste most productive by mass. Pyrosequencing of transcribed bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA showed that community composition varied across substrates and inocula, with differing ratios of hydrogenotrophic/acetoclastic methanogenic archaea associated with syntrophic partners. While communities did not cluster by either inoculum or substrate, additional sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in the source sludge revealed that the bacterial communities were influenced by their inoculum. These results suggest that complete and efficient AD systems could potentially be assembled from different microbial inocula and consist of taxonomically diverse communities that nevertheless perform similar functions.","Wilkins, David; Rao, Subramanya; Lu, Xiaoying; Lee, Patrick K H",Frontiers in microbiology,55,1

We aimed to assess the long-term impact of PCV on disease incidence. METHODS We did 10 years of population-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and WHO defined radiological pneumonia with consolidation in rural Gambia. The surveillance population included all Basse Health and Demographic Surveillance System residents aged 2 months or older. Nurses screened all outpatients and inpatients at all health facilities using standardised criteria for referral. Clinicians then applied criteria for patient investigation. We defined IPD as a compatible illness with isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from a normally sterile site (cerebrospinal fluid, blood, or pleural fluid). We compared disease incidence between baseline (May 12, 2008-May 11, 2010) and post-vaccine years (2016-2017), in children aged 2 months to 14 years, adjusting for changes in case ascertainment over time. FINDINGS We identified 22 728 patients for investigation and detected 342 cases of IPD and 2623 cases of radiological pneumonia. Among children aged 2-59 months, IPD incidence declined from 184 cases per 100 000 person-years to 38 cases per 100 000 person-years, an 80% reduction (95% CI 69-87). Non-pneumococcal bacteraemia incidence did not change significantly over time (incidence rate ratio 0·88; 95% CI, 0·64-1·21). We detected zero cases of vaccine-type IPD in the 2-11 month age group in 2016-17. Incidence of radiological pneumonia decreased by 33% (95% CI 24-40), from 10·5 to 7·0 per 1000 person-years in the 2-59 month age group, while pneumonia hospitalisations declined by 27% (95% CI 22-31). In the 5-14 year age group, IPD incidence declined by 69% (95% CI -28 to 91) and radiological pneumonia by 27% (95% CI -5 to 49). INTERPRETATION Routine introduction of PCV13 substantially reduced the incidence of childhood IPD and pneumonia in rural Gambia, including elimination of vaccine-type IPD in infants. Other low-income countries can expect substantial impact from the introduction of PCV13 using a schedule of three primary doses.

We hypothesize that the disparity is significantly smaller in areas with a higher ratio of green spaces. County level data on the SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of black and white individuals in 135 of the most urbanized counties across the United States were collected. The total population in these counties is 132,350,027, comprising 40.3% of the U.S. population. The ratio of green spaces by land-cover type in each county was extracted from satellite imagery. A hierarchical regression analysis measured cross-sectional associations between racial disparity in infection rates and green spaces, after controlling for socioeconomic, demographic, pre-existing chronic disease, and built-up area factors. We found a higher ratio of green spaces at the county level is significantly associated with a lower racial disparity in infection rates. Four types of green space have significant negative associations with the racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.

We aimed at building a prospective cohort of MS patients with standardized collection of demographic, clinical, MRI data and body fluids that can be used to develop prognostic indicators and biomarkers of disease evolution and therapeutic response. The Swiss MS Cohort (SMSC) is a prospective observational study performed across seven Swiss MS centers including patients with MS, clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), radiologically isolated syndrome or neuromyelitis optica. Neurological and radiological assessments and biological samples are collected every 6-12 months. We recruited 872 patients (clinically isolated syndrome [CIS] 5.5%, relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS] 85.8%, primary progressive MS [PPMS] 3.5%, secondary progressive MS [SPMS] 5.2%) between June 2012 and July 2015. We performed 2,286 visits (median follow-up 398 days) and collected 2,274 serum, plasma and blood samples, 152 cerebrospinal fluid samples and 1,276 brain MRI scans. 158 relapses occurred and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores increased in PPMS, SPMS and RRMS patients experiencing relapses. Most RRMS patients were treated with fingolimod (33.4%), natalizumab (24.5%) or injectable DMDs (13.6%).

P. Duguid, J. Hyg. 44, 6 (1946)] and the model of Wells [W. F. Wells, Am. J. Hyg. 20, 611-618 (1934)]. These seminal works have been pillars of past and current guidelines published by health organizations. However, in about one century, understanding of turbulent aerosol transport by jets and plumes has enormously progressed, and it is now time to use this body of developed knowledge. In this work, we use detailed experiments and accurate computationally intensive numerical simulations of droplet-laden turbulent puffs emitted during sneezes in a wide range of environmental conditions. We consider the same emission-number of drops, drop size distribution, and initial velocity-and we change environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity, and we observe strong variation in droplets' evaporation or condensation in accordance with their local temperature and humidity microenvironment. We assume that 3% of the initial droplet volume is made of nonvolatile matter. Our systematic analysis confirms that droplets' lifetime is always about one order of magnitude larger compared to previous predictions, in some cases up to 200 times. Finally, we have been able to produce original virus exposure maps, which can be a useful instrument for health scientists and practitioners to calibrate new guidelines to prevent short-range airborne disease transmission.","Wang, Jietuo; Alipour, Mobin; Soligo, Giovanni; Roccon, Alessio; De Paoli, Marco; Picano, Francesco; Soldati, Alfredo",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,55,5

In addition to its role as hypothalamic releasing hormone, GnRH has multiple functions including modulator of neural activity within the nervous system and of resulting behaviors. These multiple functions are reflected by the existence of multiple isoforms. Despite its importance as a critical hypothalamic releasing hormone, the gnrh1 gene has been lost in zebrafish, and its reproductive function is not compensated for by other GnRH isoforms (GnRH2 and GnRH3), suggesting that, surprisingly, zebrafish do not use any of the GnRH peptides to control reproduction and fertility. Previously we proposed that Phoenixin/SMIM20, a novel peptide identified in mammals and the ligand for the orphan GPR173, is a potential candidate to control the initiation of sexual development and fertility in the zebrafish. Here we confirm the sequence of the zebrafish phoenixin/smim20 gene and by RT-PCR show that it is expressed early in development through adulthood. Subsequently we show that phoenixin/smim20 is expressed in the adult brain including the regions of the hypothalamus important in the control of fertility and reproduction.","Ceriani, R; Calfún, C; Whitlock, K E",Gene expression patterns : GEP,55,1

The framework can efficiently predict whether or not a CT scan contains pneumonia while simultaneously identifying pneumonia types between COVID-19 and Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) caused by other viruses. In the proposed method, two 3D-ResNets are coupled together into a single model for the two above-mentioned tasks via a novel prior-attention strategy. We extend residual learning with the proposed prior-attention mechanism and design a new so-called prior-attention residual learning (PARL) block. The model can be easily built by stacking the PARL blocks and trained end-to-end using multi-task losses. More specifically, one 3D-ResNet branch is trained as a binary classifier using lung images with and without pneumonia so that it can highlight the lesion areas within the lungs. Simultaneously, inside the PARL blocks, prior-attention maps are generated from this branch and used to guide another branch to learn more discriminative representations for the pneumonia-type classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the performance of COVID-19 screening. Compared to other methods, it achieves a state-of-the-art result. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily extended to other similar clinical applications such as computer-aided detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in CT images, glaucoma lesions in Retina fundus images, etc.","Wang, Jun; Bao, Yiming; Wen, Yaofeng; Lu, Hongbing; Luo, Hu; Xiang, Yunfei; Li, Xiaoming; Liu, Chen; Qian, Dahong",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,55,7

Surgery and endoscopic dilation are the mainstays of treatment, while drug therapy has often been considered contra-indicated. The benefit of non-surgical treatments, particularly drug and endoscopic therapy, need to be defined. METHODS PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, Emcare, EBSCO and the Cochrane Library (inception until August 30, 2019) were searched. Studies with ≥10 patients with Crohn's disease strictures, reporting on outcomes following medication or endoscopic treatment, were included. RESULTS Of 3480 records, 85 studies met inclusion criteria and formed the basis of this analysis. Twenty-five studies assessed drug therapy; none were randomized trials. Despite study heterogeneity anti-TNF therapy appeared effective, with 50% of patients avoiding surgery after 4 years follow up. No other drug therapy was of demonstrable benefit. Sixty studies assessed endoscopic therapy including 56 on endoscopic balloon dilation, two assessed needle knife stricturotomy, and two stent insertion. Dilation was equally effective for de-novo and anastomotic strictures ≤5cm in length, with most studies reporting a subsequent surgical rate of 30 to 50%. Repeat dilation was required in approximately half of all patients. CONCLUSIONS Anti-TNF drug therapy and endoscopic balloon dilation are effective strategies for avoiding surgery in patients with stricturing Crohn's disease. Additional endoscopic therapies require further evaluation. Early data suggest that combining these therapies may provide greater benefit than individual therapies. Optimisation of current drug and endoscopic therapy, and the incorporation of newer therapies, are needed for stricturing Crohn's disease.","Schulberg, Julien D; Wright, Emily K; Holt, Bronte A; Wilding, Helen E; Hamilton, Amy L; Ross, Alyson L; Kamm, Michael A",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,55,14

These effects of pneumoperitoneum are associated with significant haemodynamic changes, increasing the morbidity of the patient. AIM The present study compared the efficacy of dexmedetomidine and esmolol on hemodynamic responses during laparoscopic cholecystectomy Materials and Methods: A total of 90 patients aged 20-60 y, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II, of either sex, planned for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included. The patients were randomly divided into three groups of 30 each. Group D received dexmedetomidine loading dose 1 mcg/kg over a period of 15 min and maintenance 0.5 mcg/kg/h throughout the pneumoperitoneum. Group E received esmolol loading dose 1 mg/kg over a period of 5 min and maintenance 0.5 mg/kg/h throughout the pneumoperitoneum. Group C received same volume of normal saline. MEASUREMENTS Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded preoperative, after study drug, after induction, after intubation, after pneumoperitoneum at 15 min intervals, post pneumoperitoneum and postoperative period after 15 min. Propofol induction dose, intraoperative fentanyl requirement and sedation score were also recorded. RESULTS In group D, there was no statistically significant increase in HR and blood pressure after pneumoperitoneum at any time intervals, whereas in Group E, there was a statistical significant increase in MAP after pneumoperitoneum at 15, 45, and 60 min only and HR during the whole pneumoperitoneum period. There was a significant decrease in induction dose of propofol and intraoperative fentanyl requirement in Group D and E, compared to Group C (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION Dexmedetomidine is more effective than esmolol for attenuating the hemodynamic response to pneumoperitoneum in elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Dexmedetomidine and esmolol also reduced requirements of anaesthetic agents.","Srivastava, Vinit K; Nagle, Vaishali; Agrawal, Sanjay; Kumar, Diwakar; Verma, Amit; Kedia, Sunil",Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,55,31

However, empirical data to support this recommendation are limited. METHODS During an outbreak of HFMD and herpangina due to infection by the human enterovirus 71, we defined a case as a vesicular papular rash on the hands, feet, buttocks, or oral mucosa and onset from April 30 to June 26, 2008. We selected 176 HFMD and herpangina case-children and a stratified random sample of 201 asymptomatic control-children; frequency matched according to residency status. We administered a questionnaire to the parents about their children's exposures and hygienic behaviors. RESULTS Risk factors for HFMD and herpangina included playing with neighborhood children (odds ratio [OR]: 11 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.2-17]), visiting an outpatient clinic for another reason ≤ 1 week before onset (OR: 20 [95% CI: 5.0-88]), and community exposures to crowded places (OR: 7.3 [95% CI: 4.1-13]).

Methods This study examined a cohort of 54 residents of a long-term care psychiatric rehabilitation program from March to April 2020. Baseline demographics, clinical diagnoses, and vital signs were examined to look for statistical differences between positive versus negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) groups. During the early phase of the pandemic, the facility closely followed the local shelter-in-place order (starting March 19, 2020) and symptom-based testing. Results Of the residents, the primary psychiatric diagnoses were schizoaffective disorder: 28 (51.9%), schizophrenia: 21 (38.9%), bipolar I disorder: 3 (5.5%), and unspecified psychotic disorder: 2 (3.7%). Forty (74%) of 54 residents tested positive for SARS-COV-2, with a doubling time of 3.9 days. There were no statistical differences between the positive SARS-COV-2 versus negative groups for age or race/ethnicity. Psychiatric and medical conditions were not significantly associated with contracting SARS-COV-2, with the exception of obesity (n = 17 [43%] positive vs n = 12 [86%] negative, P = .01). Medical monitoring of vital signs and symptoms did not lead to earlier detection. All of the residents completely recovered, with the last resident no longer showing any symptoms 24 days from the index case. Conclusion Research is needed to determine optimal strategies for long-term care mental health settings that incorporate frequent testing and personal protective equipment use to prevent rapid transmission of SARS-COV-2.","Xiong, Glen L; Atkin, Alec; Moquin, Kelly; Candido, MarieChristi; Beilenson, Peter; Kasirye, Olivia; Wasserman, Michael; Blum, Patricia; Hilty, Donald",The primary care companion for CNS disorders,55,20

No consensus exists regarding when to perform testing for risk factors in couples with RPL. Some guidelines recommend testing if a patient has had two pregnancy losses whereas others advise to test after three losses. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the current evidence on the prevalence of abnormal test results for RPL amongst patients with two versus three or more pregnancy losses. We also aimed to contribute to the debate regarding whether the investigations for RPL should take place after two or three or more pregnancy losses. SEARCH METHODS Relevant studies were identified by a systematic search in OVID Medline and EMBASE from inception to March 2019. A search for RPL was combined with a broad search for terms indicative of number of pregnancy losses, screening/testing for pregnancy loss or the prevalence of known risk factors. Meta-analyses were performed in case of adequate clinical and statistical homogeneity. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. OUTCOMES From a total of 1985 identified publications, 21 were included in this systematic review and 19 were suitable for meta-analyses. For uterine abnormalities (seven studies, odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.79-1.27, I2 = 0%) and for antiphospholipid syndrome (three studies, OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86-1.25, I2 = 0%) we found low quality evidence for a lack of a difference in prevalence of abnormal test results between couples with two versus three or more pregnancy losses. We found insufficient evidence of a difference in prevalence of abnormal test results between couples with two versus three or more pregnancy losses for chromosomal abnormalities (10 studies, OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55-1.10), inherited thrombophilia (five studies) and thyroid disorders (two studies, OR 0.52, 95% CI: 0.06-4.56). WIDER IMPLICATIONS A difference in prevalence in uterine abnormalities and antiphospholipid syndrome is unlikely in women with two versus three pregnancy losses. We cannot exclude a difference in prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities, inherited thrombophilia and thyroid disorders following testing after two versus three pregnancy losses. The results of this systematic review may support investigations after two pregnancy losses in couples with RPL, but it should be stressed that additional studies of the prognostic value of test results used in the RPL population are urgently needed. An evidenced-based treatment is not currently available in the majority of cases when abnormal test results are present.","van Dijk, Myrthe M; Kolte, Astrid M; Limpens, Jacqueline; Kirk, Emma; Quenby, Siobhan; van Wely, Madelon; Goddijn, Mariëtte",Human reproduction update,55,33

Our aim was to determine whether intrabolus pressure (IBP) can identify structural EGJ processes when IRP is normal. In this observational cohort study, adult patients with dysphagia and undergoing HRM were evaluated for endoscopic evidence of structural EGJ processes (strictures, rings, hiatus hernia) in the setting of normal IRP. HRM metrics [IRP, distal contractile integral (DCI), distal latency (DL), IBP, and EGJ contractile integral (EGJ-CI)] were compared among 74 patients with structural EGJ findings (62.8 ± 1.6 yr, 67.6% women), 27 patients with normal EGD (52.9 ± 3.2 yr, 70.3% women), and 21 healthy controls (27.6 ± 0.6 yr, 52.4% women). Findings were validated in 85 consecutive symptomatic patients to address clinical utility. In the primary cohort, mean IBP (18.4 ± 0.9 mmHg) was higher with structural EGJ findings compared with dysphagia with normal EGD (13.5 ± 1.1 mmHg, P = 0.002) and healthy controls (10.9 ± 0.9 mmHg, P < 0.001). However, mean IRP, DCI, DL, and EGJ-CI were similar across groups (P > 0.05 for each comparison). During multiple rapid swallows, IBP remained higher in the structural findings group compared with controls (P = 0.02). Similar analysis of the prospective validation cohort confirmed IBP elevation in structural EGJ processes, but correlation with dysphagia could not be demonstrated. We conclude that elevated IBP predicts the presence of structural EGJ processes even when IRP is normal, but correlation with dysphagia is suboptimal.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) above the upper limit of normal defines esophageal outflow obstruction using high-resolution manometry. In patients with normal IRP, elevated intrabolus pressure (IBP) can be a surrogate marker for a structural restrictive or obstructive process at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ). This has the potential to augment the clinical value of esophageal HRM by raising suspicion for a structural EGJ process when IBP is elevated.","Quader, Farhan; Reddy, Chanakyaram; Patel, Amit; Gyawali, C Prakash",American journal of physiology.

The aim of this study was to investigate patient outcomes and nutritional deficiencies following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) during a follow-up of two years. Methods. Over a period of 56 months, all consecutive patients who underwent SG were documented in this prospective, single-center, observational study. The study endpoints included operative time, complication rates, nutritional deficiencies and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL). Results. From September 26, 2005 to May 28, 2009, 82 patients (female : male = 48 : 34) with a mean age of 43.3 years (range: 22-64) and a preoperative BMI of 52.5 kg/m² (range: 36.8-77.0) underwent SG. Major complications were observed in 9.8% of the patients, with 1 death. During follow up 51.2% of patients were supplemented with iron, 36.6% with zinc, 37.8% with calcium, 26.8% with vitamin D, 46.3% with vitamin B12 and 41.5% with folic acid. %EWL was 54.3, 65.3 and 62.6% after 6, 12 and 24 months. Conclusion. SG as a single step procedure is an effective bariatric intervention. Nutritional deficiencies after SG can be detected by routine nutritional screening. Our results show that Vitamin B12 supplementation should suggest routinely after SG.","Pech, Nicole; Meyer, Frank; Lippert, Hans; Manger, Thomas; Stroh, Christine",Journal of obesity,55,24

A better understanding of the role of virus infections in this condition is needed to improve clinical management and preventive measures. The aim of the study was therefore to assess the association between specific respiratory viruses and childhood CAP. METHODS A case-control study was conducted during 3 years in Stockholm, Sweden. Cases were children aged ≤5 years with radiological CAP. Healthy controls were consecutively enrolled at child health units during routine visits and matched to cases on age and calendar time. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained and analysed by real-time PCR for 15 viruses. Multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to account for coinfections with other viruses and baseline characteristics. RESULTS A total of 121 cases, of which 93 cases met the WHO criteria for radiological pneumonia, and 240 controls were included in the study. Viruses were detected in 81% of the cases (n=98) and 56% of the controls (n=134).

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to describe the senior author's (MNN) experience applying a widely available surgical drape as a postoperative sterile surgical site dressing for both cranial and spinal procedures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Surgical site infection (SSI) is an important complication of spine surgery that can result in significant morbidity. There is wide variation in wound care management in practice, including dressing type. Given the known bactericidal properties of the surgical drape, there may be a benefit of continuing its use immediately postoperatively. METHODS All of the senior author's cases from September 2014 through September 2015 were reviewed. These were contrasted to the previous year prior to the institution of a sterile surgical drape as a postoperative dressing. RESULTS Only one surgical case out of 157 operative interventions (35 cranial, 124 spinal) required operative debridement due to infection. From September 2013 to September 2014, prior to the institution of a sterile surgical drape as dressing, the author had five infections out of 143 operations (46 cranial, 97 spinal) requiring intervention. CONCLUSION The implementation of a sterile surgical drape as a closed postoperative surgical site dressing has led to a decrease in surgical site infections. The technique is simple and widely available, and should be considered for use to diminish surgical site infections.","Felbaum, Daniel; Syed, Hasan R; Snyder, Rita; McGowan, Jason E; Jha, Ribhu T; Nair, Mani N",Cureus,55,5

The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of intracranial stenting on the RC of the implanted artery using 3D datasets. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four patients receiving FDA-approved neurovascular stents to support coil embolization of brain aneurysms were chosen for this study. The stents were located in the ICA, ACA, or MCA. We analyzed C-arm rotational angiography and contrast-enhanced cone beam CT datasets before and after stent implantation, respectively, to ascertain changes in vessel curvature. The images were reconstructed, and the vessel centerline was extracted. From the centerline, the RC was calculated. RESULTS The average implanted stent length was 25.4 ± 5.8 mm, with a pre-implantation RC of 7.1 ± 2.1 mm and a postimplantation RC of 10.7 ± 3.5 mm. This resulted in a 3.6 ± 2.7 mm change in the RC due to implantation (P < .0001), more than a 50% increase from the pre-implantation value. There was no difference in the change of RC for the different locations studied. The change in RC was not impacted by the extent of coil packing within the aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS The implantation of neurovascular stents can be shown to have a large impact on the RC of the vessel. This will lead to a change in the local hemodynamics and flow pattern within the aneurysm.","King, R M; Chueh, J-Y; van der Bom, I M J; Silva, C F; Carniato, S L; Spilberg, G; Wakhloo, A K; Gounis, M J",AJNR.

Long-term outcomes are not yet prospectively studied in a controlled fashion. METHODS Under IRB approval, from January 2011-April 2013, 91 hernias were repaired laparoscopically with self-gripping mesh without additional fixation. Patients were followed for at least 1 year. Demographics and intraoperative data (defect location, size, and mesh deployment time) are recorded. VAS is used in the recovery room (RR) to score pain, and the Carolinas Comfort Scale ™ (CCS), a validated 0-5 pain/quality of life (QoL) score where a mean score of >1.0 means symptomatic pain, is employed at 2 weeks and at 1 year. Morbidities, narcotic usage, days to full activity and return to work, and CCS scores are reported. RESULTS Sixty two patients, with 91 hernias repaired with self-gripping mesh, completed follow-up at a mean time period of 14.8 months. Seventeen hernias were direct defects (average size 3.0 cm). Mesh deployment time was 193.7 s. RR pain was 1.1/10 using a VAS. Total average oxycodone/acetaminophen (5 mg/325 mg) usage = 5.0 tablets, days to full activity was 1.6, and return to work was 4.2 days. Thirteen small asymptomatic seromas were palpated without any recurrences or groin tenderness, and all seromas resolved by the 6 month visit. Transient testis discomfort was reported in five patients. Urinary retention was 3.2%. Mean CCS™ scores at the first visit for groin pain laying, bending, sitting, walking, and step-climbing were 0.2, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.3, respectively. At the first post op visit, 4.8% had symptomatic pain (CCS > 1). At 14.8 months, no patients reported symptomatic pain with CCS scores for all 62 patients averaging 0.02, (range 0-0.43). There are no recurrences thus far. CONCLUSIONS Self-gripping mesh can be safely used during laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repairs; our cohort had a rapid recovery, and at the 1-year follow-up visit, there were no recurrences and no patients reported any chronic pain as defined by a CCS™ > 1.","Bresnahan, Erin; Bates, Andrew; Wu, Andrew; Reiner, Mark; Jacob, Brian",Surgical endoscopy,55,16

Surgical site infections are the most common complication after LRYGB surgery. OBJECTIVE To compare the superficial surgical site infections (sSSI) rate before and after the implementation of our intraoperative technique. SETTING Academic medical center. METHODS Our intraoperative technique relies on sterile coverage of the circular stapler, sterile specimen-bag retrieval of the gastrojejunostomy enteric remnant, and port site Penrose drainage. We analyzed our sSSI outcomes before and after implementation of our technique in all LRYGBs performed by a single surgeon from 2009 to 2015. We took into account patient age; sex; baseline body mass index (BMI); smoking status; and co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. χ(2) and multivariate analysis were performed. RESULTS We performed 486 LRYGBs in 2009-2015. The cohort before implementation of our technique (group 1) included 164 patients (33.7%) and the cohort after implementation (group 2) included 322 patients (66.3%). Both groups were similar in age, sex, smoking status, and rates of diabetes and hyperlipidemia but differed in BMI, operative time, and prevalence of hypertension. Hypertension was not a confounder for sSSI (P = .35). The sSSI rate was 9.15% for group 1 and 3.42% for group 2 (P = .0079). Controlling for BMI and operative time, multivariate analysis revealed a significant reduction in sSSI (odds ratio 2.98 [95% CI 1.33-6.69]) with our technique. CONCLUSIONS We describe a reproducible intraoperative technique that significantly reduces sSSI in LRYGB procedures.

We used Cox regression to estimate the independent association of recent housing status (housed vs. unhoused, housing stability, and housing trajectory) on HCV incidence. Among 712 participants, 245 incident HCV infections occurred over 963.8 person-years (py) (cumulative incidence 24.4/100 py). An inverse relationship between time housed and HCV incidence was observed (always unhoused 45.0/100 py, 95% confidence interval (CI) 37.1, 54.5; variably housed 18.0/100 py, 95% CI 15.0, 21.3; and always housed 7.0/100 py, 95% CI 3.0, 17.3). In Cox regression models controlling for confounders, those unhoused versus housed at baseline had a 1.9-fold increased infection risk (95% CI 1.4, 2.6). Those always unhoused versus always housed had a 1.5 times greater risk of HCV (95% CI 1.0, 2.3), and those spending a portion of time in stable housing a lower risk (adjusted relative hazard 0.05, 95% CI 0.3, 0.9) with a similar trend for those being housed for less time. Young adult PWID experiencing both recent and chronic states of being unhoused are at elevated risk for HCV infection. Importantly for this group of PWID, our findings indicate that some frequency of residential housing significantly reduces HCV infection risk.","Morris, Meghan D; Yen, Irene H; Shiboski, Steve; Evans, Jennifer L; Page, Kimberly",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,55,1

METHODS A total of ninety-seven patients with a Conserve Plus metal-on-metal hip resurfacing implant were followed prospectively for two years. Cobalt and chromium levels in erythrocytes, serum, and urine were measured preoperatively as well as three, six, twelve, and twenty-four months postoperatively. RESULTS The median serum cobalt and chromium ion levels were 1.04 μg/L (range, 0.31 to 7.42 μg/L) and 2.00 μg/L (range, 0.28 to 10.49 μg/L), respectively, at one year after surgery and 1.08 μg/L (range, 0.44 to 7.13 μg/L) and 1.64 μg/L (range, 0.47 to 10.95 μg/L), respectively, at two years after surgery.

METHODS A single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted, assigning 112 patients with resectable intrathoracic esophageal cancer to either RAMIE or OTE. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of overall surgery-related postoperative complications (modified Clavien-Dindo classification grade 2-5). RESULTS Overall surgery-related postoperative complications occurred less frequently after RAMIE (59%) compared to OTE (80%) [risk ratio with RAMIE (RR) 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.57-0.96; P = 0.02].

ISG15 expression and protein ISGylation modulate viral infection; however, the viral mechanisms regulating the function of ISG15 and ISGylation are not well understood. We recently showed that ISGylation suppresses the growth of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) at multiple steps of the virus life cycle and that the virus-encoded pUL26 protein inhibits protein ISGylation. In this study, we demonstrate that the HCMV UL50-encoded transmembrane protein, a component of the nuclear egress complex, also inhibits ISGylation. pUL50 interacted with UBE1L, an E1-activating enzyme for ISGylation, and (to a lesser extent) with ISG15, as did pUL26. However, unlike pUL26, pUL50 caused proteasomal degradation of UBE1L. The UBE1L level induced in human fibroblast cells by interferon beta treatment or virus infection was reduced by pUL50 expression. This activity of pUL50 involved the transmembrane (TM) domain within its C-terminal region, although pUL50 could interact with UBE1L in a manner independent of the TM domain. Consistently, colocalization of pUL50 with UBE1L was observed in cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor. Furthermore, we found that RNF170, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated ubiquitin E3 ligase, interacted with pUL50 and promoted pUL50-mediated UBE1L degradation via ubiquitination. Our results demonstrate a novel role for the pUL50 transmembrane protein of HCMV in the regulation of protein ISGylation.IMPORTANCE Proteins can be conjugated covalently by ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins, such as SUMO and ISG15. ISG15 is highly induced in viral infection, and ISG15 conjugation, termed ISGylation, plays important regulatory roles in viral growth. Although ISGylation has been shown to negatively affect many viruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), viral countermeasures that might modulate ISGylation are not well understood. In the present study, we show that the transmembrane protein encoded by HCMV UL50 inhibits ISGylation by causing proteasomal degradation of UBE1L, an E1-activating enzyme for ISGylation. This pUL50 activity requires membrane targeting. In support of this finding, RNF170, an ER-associated ubiquitin E3 ligase, interacts with pUL50 and promotes UL50-mediated UBE1L ubiquitination and degradation. Our results provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that viruses can regulate ISGylation by directly targeting the ISGylation E1 enzyme.","Lee, Myoung Kyu; Kim, Ye Ji; Kim, Young-Eui; Han, Tae-Hee; Milbradt, Jens; Marschall, Manfred; Ahn, Jin-Hyun",Journal of virology,55,26

Generally, relatives are recognized as vital partners in health care, but in-depth knowledge on how these family involvement processes take place in the everyday practices of EDs is sparse. The aim of this study is to explore the practice of involving relatives in the acute ambulatory clinical pathway in the ED, as seen from the perspectives of patients and relatives. METHODS The study was conducted as ethnographic fieldwork in an ED at a Danish Regional Hospital. Two months of participant-observation were carried out focusing on 43 patients. Of these, 18 patients and/or relatives were selected for telephone interviews after 1 week, and of these 11 were selected for in-depth interviews 3 weeks later. RESULTS Unpredictability is a basic condition of any ED. For the patients and relatives, who are unfamiliar with the routines in the ED, unpredictability translates to a sense of temporal and existential unpredictability, reinforced by a sense of not knowing when the examinations will be completed or if/when they will be sent home. Relatives' involvement in the ED is affected by this sense of unpredictability and by the existing relations between patients and their relatives prior to entering the ED. The stay in the ED is only one 'stop' in the complete acute ambulatory clinical pathway but relatives' involvement also concerns the time before and after the stay in the ED. Practices of involving relatives leave (some) relatives invisible in the clinical pathway. As a consequence, they are often not addressed, which un-enables their involvement. CONCLUSION Involvement of relatives presupposes recognizing the relatives as participants if they are to be involved in the patient's clinical pathway in the ED. As a start, it is advisable that the medical staff ask the patients on arrival who has accompanied them in the ED, and if and in what way they want their companions involved in the ED. There is a need for a more integrated and contextualized understanding of relatives' involvement, as it takes place along an extended acute ambulatory clinical pathway.","Sagoo, Susanne Nissen; Grytnes, Regine",BMC health services research,55,1

METHODS A total of 30 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 5 groups with complete random experiment design: Sham group (Sham), MCT group, TXL group, sildenafil (SIL) group and combination group (TXL+SIL), 6 rats in each group. Rats were injected with 50 mg/kg MCT solution for inducing PAH model except for those in the sham group. From the day of modeling, rats of TXL, SIL and TXL+SIL groups were given TXL (1.2 g/kg), SIL (10 mg/kg) and combination solution (TXL:1.2 g/kg, SIL: 10 mg/kg) respectively, and rats in Sham and MCT groups were given normal saline (5 mL/kg). The samples were collected and tested after 21 consecutive days of intragastric administration. Echocardiography was used to measure the related indices of RVF, including pulmonary arterial flow spectrum, pulmonary artery diameter (PAD), right ventricular wall thickness (RVWT), right ventricular diameter (RVD), tricuspidannular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), right atrium transverse diameter (RAT), and inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD). Elastic Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining was adopted to measure the percentage of wall thickness (WT%) of pulmonary arteriols. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of right ventricular cardiomyocytes. RESULTS MCT-induced PAH rat model was successfully established. In MCT group the wall of pulmonary arterioles exhibited a prominent-increase thickness, PAD, RVWT, RVD, RAT, IVCD, WT%, right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI) as well as CSA of RV cardiomyocyte significantly increased (all P<0.01), and TAPSE markedly decreased (P<0.01). At the same time, TXL prominently improved all of the above indices (all P<0.01). In comparison with SIL, TXL significantly reduced RVD (P<0.05) and decreased CAS of RV cardiomyocytes (P<0.01), but TAPSE in SIL group was much larger than in TXL group (P<0.01). Moreover, TAPSE in TXL+SIL group was larger than that in TXL group (P<0.01), while the two groups performed equally well in terms of the other indices.

Synthetic αT (8 stereoisomers; all rac-αT) is added to infant formula at higher concentrations than natural αT (RRR-αT only) to adjust for bio-potency differences, but its effects on brain development are poorly understood. OBJECTIVES The objective was to determine the impact of bio-potency-adjusted dietary all rac-αT versus RRR-αT, fed to dams, on the hippocampal gene expression in weanling mice. METHODS Male/female pairs of C57BL/6J mice were fed AIN 93-G containing RRR-αT (NAT) or all rac-αT (SYN) at 37.5 or 75 IU/kg (n = 10/group) throughout gestation and lactation. Male pups were euthanized at 21 days. Half the brain was evaluated for the αT concentration and stereoisomer distribution. The hippocampus was dissected from the other half, and RNA was extracted and sequenced. Milk αT was analyzed in separate dams. RESULTS A total of 797 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the hippocampi across the 4 dietary groups, at a false discovery rate of 10%. Comparing the NAT-37.5 group to the NAT-75 group or the SYN-37.5 group to the SYN-75 group, small differences in brain αT concentrations (10%; P < 0.05) led to subtle changes (<10%) in gene expression of 600 (NAT) or 487 genes (SYN), which were statistically significant. Marked differences in brain αT stereoisomer profiles (P < 0.0001) had a small effect on fewer genes (NAT-37.5 vs. SYN-37.5, 179; NAT-75 vs. SYN-75, 182). Most of the DEGs were involved in transcription regulation and synapse formation. A network analysis constructed around known vitamin E interacting proteins (VIPs) revealed a group of 32 DEGs between NAT-37.5 vs. SYN-37.5, explained by expression of the gene for the VIP, protein kinase C zeta (Pkcz). CONCLUSIONS In weanling mouse hippocampi, a network of genes involved in transcription regulation and synapse formation was differentially affected by dam diet αT concentration and source: all rac-αT or RRR-αT.","Rhodes, Justin S; Rendeiro, Catarina; Mun, Jonathan G; Du, Kristy; Thaman, Pragya; Snyder, Amanda; Pinardo, Heinrich; Drnevich, Jenny; Chandrasekaran, Sriram; Lai, Chron-Si; Schimpf, Karen J; Kuchan, Matthew J",The Journal of nutrition,55,1

The number of manuscripts on preprint servers is soaring and peer-reviewed publications using MS-based proteomics are beginning to emerge. To facilitate proteomic research on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, this report presents deep-scale proteomes (10,000 proteins; >130,000 peptides) of common cell line models, notably Vero E6, Calu-3, Caco-2, and ACE2-A549 that characterize their protein expression profiles including viral entry factors such as ACE2 or TMPRSS2. Using the 9 kDa protein SRP9 and the breast cancer oncogene BRCA1 as examples, we show how the proteome expression data can be used to refine the annotation of protein-coding regions of the African green monkey and the Vero cell line genomes. Monitoring changes of the proteome on viral infection revealed widespread expression changes including transcriptional regulators, protease inhibitors, and proteins involved in innate immunity. Based on a library of 98 stable-isotope labeled synthetic peptides representing 11 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we developed PRM (parallel reaction monitoring) assays for nano-flow and micro-flow LC-MS/MS. We assessed the merits of these PRM assays using supernatants of virus-infected Vero E6 cells and challenged the assays by analyzing two diagnostic cohorts of 24 (+30) SARS-CoV-2 positive and 28 (+9) negative cases. In light of the results obtained and including recent publications or manuscripts on preprint servers, we critically discuss the merits of MS-based proteomics for SARS-CoV-2 research and testing.","Zecha, Jana; Lee, Chien-Yun; Bayer, Florian P; Meng, Chen; Grass, Vincent; Zerweck, Johannes; Schnatbaum, Karsten; Michler, Thomas; Pichlmair, Andreas; Ludwig, Christina; Kuster, Bernhard",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,55,1

However, the application of RPS to the field of gastrectomy is still underdeveloped. We started laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy through an umbilical port plus another 5 mm port (dual port laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy: DP-LATG) as an RPS for laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG). A SILS™ port was inserted into an umbilical incision, while another 5 mm port was inserted at the right flank region. We performed DP-LATG on ten early gastric cancer cases consecutively from May 2011 onwards, with the surgeries all performed by a single surgeon. The results of DP-LATG were compared with the resuls of ten conventional LATGs (C-LATGs) that were performed between March 2010 and April 2011. There were no significant differences in the mean operation time (DP-LATG, 253.0 ± 26.8 min; C-LATG, 235.5 ± 20.6 min; p = 0.119), mean blood loss (33.4 ± 23.7, 39.8 ± 60.4 mL, p = 0.759), and number of lymph nodes dissected (31.6 ± 12.3, 40.9 ± 18.7, p = 0.205). There were no intraoperative complications, there was no need for additional ports, and there were no conversions to open surgery nor postoperative complications in the DP-LATG cases.

Increased alcohol use has been extensively documented during other crises, particularly among persons with anxiety and depression. Despite COVID-19's differential impact by age; the association of age, mental health and alcohol use during the pandemic have not been studied. This study aimed to examine whether age modified the association of possible anxiety and depression with alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two online surveys were administered to U.S. adult social media users in March and April 2020. Generalized linear models were conducted in 2020 among 5850 respondents (52.9% female; 21.9% aged 18-39 years, 47.0% aged 40-59 years, and 31.0% aged ≥60 years) to examine if age modified the association of anxiety and depression symptomatology and alcohol use. Overall, 29% of respondents reported increased alcohol use. Adjusted odds ratios of reporting increased alcohol use were 1.41 (95% CI = 1.20-1.66) among respondents with anxiety symptoms and 1.64 (95% CI = 1.21-2.23) among those with depressive symptoms compared to those without such symptoms. Whereas respondents aged 18-39 years had the highest probability of reporting increased alcohol use, the probability of older persons (40-59 and ≥ 60 years) reporting increased drinking was much greater among those with symptoms of anxiety and depression, compared to those without symptoms. These findings warrant age-differentiated public health messaging on the risks of excessive alcohol use and scale-up of substance use services for middle-aged and older adults with symptoms of depression and anxiety.","Capasso, Ariadna; Jones, Abbey M; Ali, Shahmir H; Foreman, Joshua; Tozan, Yesim; DiClemente, Ralph J",Preventive medicine,55,1

Unlike the outdoors, indoor air quality (IAQ) in nursing homes is not regulated by legislation and is seldom monitored. To that end, residents of nursing homes commonly spend the vast majority of their time indoors where they are exposed to indoor air pollutants for long periods of time. Given that many nursing home residents, especially those of advanced age, are more susceptible to the effects of air pollutants, even at low concentrations, this prolonged exposure may adversely affect their health, well-being, quality of life and increase medical expenditures due to frequent, unscheduled acute care visits and hospitalizations. We propose an action plan for assessing IAQ in nursing homes, understanding the impacts of IAQ on adverse health outcomes of nursing home residents, and addressing vulnerabilities in these facilities to safeguard health, well-being, and quality of life of nursing home residents and minimizing unscheduled acute care visits and hospitalizations. We propose that IAQ should be regularly monitored in nursing homes to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities in these facilities and that resources should be provided for remedial interventions to improve IAQ in nursing homes, including but not limited to source control, improving ventilation and filtration, and deploying air cleaners where appropriate. This proactive approach may pave the way for establishing enforceable standards for indoor air quality in nursing homes that will promote health, well-being, and quality of life of nursing home residents and reduce medical expenditures.","Reddy, Manasa; Heidarinejad, Mohammad; Stephens, Brent; Rubinstein, Israel",The Science of the total environment,55,1

DESIGN This was a bench study using a mannequin connected to an active lung simulator. The SH was fastened to the mannequin by armpit braces, which are not needed to secure the NH. MEASUREMENTS The inspiratory and expiratory variations in nCPAP delivered with two different simulated efforts (Pmus), were determined relative to the preset CPAP level. nPSV was applied at two simulated respiratory rates (RR) and two cycling-off flow thresholds. We measured inspiratory trigger delay (Delay trinsp), expiratory trigger delay (Delay trexp), time of synchrony (Time sync), trigger pressure drop (ΔP trigger), airway pressure-time product during the triggering phase (PTPt), the initial 200 ms from the onset of the ventilator pressurization (PTP 200), and the initial 300 and 500 ms from the onset of the simulated effort; this two latter parameters were expressed as the percentage of the area of ideal pressurization (PTP 300-index and PTP 500-index, respectively). RESULTS In nCPAP, at both Pmus, the differences between the two interfaces at both Pmus were small and clinically irrelevant. In nPSV, regardless of the setting, NH resulted in significantly smaller trigger delays, ΔP trigger, and PTPt. Time sync, PTP 200, PTP 300-index, and PTP 500-index were also significantly higher with the NH compared to the SH, irrespective of the setting. CONCLUSIONS Compared to the SH, the NH is equally effective in delivering nCPAP and more effective in delivering nPSV, and it is used to avoid the need for armpit braces.","Olivieri, C; Costa, R; Spinazzola, G; Ferrone, G; Longhini, F; Cammarota, G; Conti, G; Navalesi, P",Intensive care medicine,55,7

Its use rapidly expanded thereafter to include human medical treatments for a variety of acute and chronic disorders. Due to reports of severe adverse effects, the US Food and Drug Administration withdrew levamisole's approval for human use in 2000; however, medical options outside the US and illicit options worldwide allow continued accessibility to levamisole. The compound is rapidly metabolized in the body, with at least two known active metabolites. Levamisole has a broad range of immunomodulatory effects, including both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on immune responses. It is generally well tolerated at therapeutic concentrations, although a variety of autoimmune-related adverse effects have been reported, including agranulocytosis, leukopenia, purpura, and visible necrotized skin tissue. Individuals with levamisole-compromised immune systems are more susceptible to infections, including COVID-19. Since the early 2000's, levamisole has been frequently used as an adulterating agent in illicit street drugs, especially cocaine, fentanyl, and heroin. Although its prevalence has varied over time and geographically, levamisole has been detected in up to 79% of the street supply of cocaine at levels up to 74% by weight. Its presence in illicit drug markets also raises concern over the potential for exposure of children and neonates, although this is supported by only limited anecdotal evidence. Levamisole is not currently included in routine drug testing panels, although a variety of confirmatory testing techniques exist across a range of antemortem and postmortem specimen options. Because of its varying presence in illicit drug markets, both the medical and forensic communities need to be aware of levamisole and its potential impact on toxicological investigations.","Midthun, Kari M; Nelson, Lewis S; Logan, Barry K",Therapeutic drug monitoring,55,16

For this an innovative aerosol chamber was developed, that collected PM(2.5) on quartz microfiber filters. With AIV contaminated PM(2.5) dust-coated filters different incubation times ranging from 0 to 4 days and storage mainly at +4 and +20 degrees C and at different relative humidity (RH) were performed. Embryonic death in inoculated hen's eggs with filter elute was the AIV infectivity read out. To determine viral genome presence quantitative real time RT-PCR was applied. The filter elutes contained AIV genome as well as viable virus whereby +20 degrees C indicated a borderline temperature for infectious virus stability. In addition, high relative humidity was critical for AIV viability in PM(2.5). The results allowed a dispersion calculation of infectious AIV in aerosols assuming a worst case scenario for an AIV outbreak in poultry farms. Thus exposure to AIV associated with PM(2.5) is possible near to infected farms and may be a serious risk for fatal influenza disease in both man and animals. Airborne transmission should be effectively preventable by dispersion of water combined with disinfection into the inside air as well as the exhaust air stream of AIV infected farms.","Sedlmaier, N; Hoppenheidt, K; Krist, H; Lehmann, S; Lang, H; Büttner, M",Veterinary microbiology,55,31

We showed some agents with potentially favorable efficacy, acceptable safety as well as good pharmacokinetic profiles. Several therapies are under assessment to evaluate their efficacy and safety for COVID-19. However, some drugs were withdrawn due to their side effects after demonstrating some clinical efficacy. Indeed, the most effective therapies could be organ function support, convalescent plasma, anticoagulants, and immune as well as antiviral therapies, especially anti-influenza drugs due to the similarities between respiratory viruses regarding viral entry, uncoating, and replication. We encourage giving more attention to favipiravir, remdesivir, and measles vaccine.

Interviews were conducted with 30 people: 11 on non-refugee temporary visas and 19 on refugee temporary visas. Data was analyzed thematically. Analysis identified experiences of exploitation and discrimination in the Australian labor market that included difficulties securing work, underpayment, overwork, and hazardous workplaces. These experiences had negative health effects, particularly on mental health. None had made a formal complaint about their treatment, citing the precarity of their visas, difficulties finding an alternative job, and lack of knowledge about what to do. The impacts were especially evident for refugees who were also grappling with pre-settlement trauma and ongoing uncertainties about their future protection.

However, the shortage of grafts, leads to attempt liver resection (LR) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as a first-line treatment for patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis. METHODS We report results, obtained between 2000 and 2007 from a single center, involving 67 patients (mean age: 57 years) eligible for LT, who were treated with RFA, followed by LT if there was recurrence or liver failure. RESULTS Eighty three tumors were treated (mean size: 29±9 mm; 16 binodular forms). RFA achieved complete ablation in 96% of nodules. No mortality occurred. During a post-RFA median follow-up of 48 months, 38 patients experienced recurrence, corresponding to a 5-year recurrence rate of 58%. Of these, 14 patients did not receive a transplant because they fell outside the Milan criteria, 21 were transplanted, and 3 were treated by RFA after refusing LT. Binodularity (95% CI HR=2, 1.0-4.0; p=0.049) was the unique risk factor for recurrence. By the study's end-point, 24 patients had undergone LT (21 for HCC recurrence and three for liver failure). No HCC recurrence occurred after LT. Among the 43 non-transplant patients, 12 died due to HCC progression, and 27 were alive without detectable viable tumor. The probability rates for 5-year overall and tumor-free survival were 74% and 69%, respectively.

The dominant paradigm underlying most standard modeling techniques assumes that the data are concentrated near a single unknown manifold of relatively small intrinsic dimension. Here, we present a systematic framework for detecting interfaces and related anomalies in data which may fail to satisfy the manifold hypothesis. By computing the local topology of small regions around each data point, we are able to partition a given dataset into disjoint classes, each of which can be individually approximated by a single manifold. Since these manifolds may have different intrinsic dimensions, local topology discovers singular regions in data even when none of the points have been sampled precisely from the singularities. We showcase this method by identifying the intersection of two surfaces in the 24-dimensional space of cyclo-octane conformations and by locating all of the self-intersections of a Henneberg minimal surface immersed in 3-dimensional space. Due to the local nature of the topological computations, the algorithmic burden of performing such data stratification is readily distributable across several processors.","Stolz, Bernadette J; Tanner, Jared; Harrington, Heather A; Nanda, Vidit",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,55,29

Enteric neurons release neurokinin A (NKA) which activates NK2 receptors on gastrointestinal smooth muscle, leading to contraction and increased motility. In patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, the NK2 receptor antagonist ibodutant had a greater therapeutic effect in females than males. The present study aimed to determine whether gender influences the expression and activity of NK2 receptors in human colonic smooth muscle. In vitro functional studies were performed to examine the contractile responses of colonic muscle strips to NKA and the selective NK2 receptor agonist [Lys5,MeLeu9,Nle10]NKA(4-10). Contractions were also measured in the presence of ibodutant to determine its antagonistic potency. The signal transduction pathways coupled to NK2 receptor activation were investigated using second messenger inhibitors. Western blot and fluorescent immunohistochemistry were conducted to determine the protein expression and localization of NK2 receptors. NK2 receptor-mediated contractility was greater in females compared to males. When against NKA, ibodutant was more potent in females. NK2 receptor expression increased with age in females, but not in males. Phospholipase C-mediated signalling was less prominent in females compared to males, while Ca2+ sensitization via Rho kinase and protein kinase C appeared to be the dominant pathway in both genders. The distribution of NK2 receptors in the human colon did not differ between the genders. Overall, gender differences exist in the expression and activity of NK2 receptors in colonic smooth muscle. These gender distinctions should be considered in the therapeutic development of NK2 receptor agents. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The tachykinin NK2 receptor has been identified as a therapeutic target for the treatment of bowel and bladder dysfunctions. The present study has revealed gender-related variations in NK2 receptor activity, signalling transduction pathways, antagonist potency and changes in expression with age. These factors may underlie the gender differences in the treatment of diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome with NK2 receptor antagonists. Our findings highlight that gender differences should be considered in the therapeutic development of NK2 receptor agents.","Drimousis, Stelina; Markus, Irit; Murphy, Timothy V; Perera, D Shevy; Phan-Thien, Kim-Chi; Zhang, Li; Liu, Lu",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,55,1

METHODS We searched PubMed for articles published from 2008 using the search terms 'advances', 'robotic surgery equipment' and 'instrumentation'. We also searched PubMed for articles describing the latest developments in reconstructive techniques for lower and upper urinary tract procedures. Finally, we searched PubMed for original articles containing the terms 'robotic surgery training' and 'credentialing'. RESULTS With each release of hardware or ancillary instrumentation, the reconstructive abilities of the da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) improve. Recent developments in reconstructive capabilities of robotic urological surgery include posterior reconstruction during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, barbed sutures for urethrovesical anastomosis, sliding-clip renorrhaphy for robot-assisted partial nephrectomy, and repair of pelvic organ prolapse. The safe implementation of robotic surgery is aided by new guidelines in credentialing and proctoring, and the introduction of virtual reality simulators for training. CONCLUSION Robotic urological surgery is rapidly developing and expanding globally. To achieve the highest levels of safety for patients, surgeons must ensure that the implementation of robotic surgery is an integrative and effective process.","Ghani, Khurshid R; Trinh, Quoc-Dien; Sammon, Jesse; Jeong, Wooju; Dabaja, Ali; Menon, Mani",Arab journal of urology,55,24

Different manufacturers offer reusable community masks in large quantities. The efficacy of these masks, however, is unknown. Method: We tested available community masks of major manufactures and determined the filtration efficacy using radioactive aerosol particles as well as air resistance with a vacuum measurement. Results: Filtration efficacy of the tested reusable community masks ranged from 34.9% ± 1.25% to 88.7% ± 1.18%. Air resistance ranged from 4.3 ± 0.06 to 122.4 ± 0.12 Pa/cm2. There was a good correlation between filtration efficacy and air resistance (Pearson correlation 0.938, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Filtration efficacy and air resistance differ significantly between the different community masks, but the two measurements correlate well with each other within the entire test series. For optimal protection, one should select a rather airtight mask. When selecting a mask, the highest level of tolerable air resistance can be used as a selection criterion.","Maurer, Lukas; Peris, Davide; Kerl, Jens; Guenther, Frank; Koehler, Dieter; Dellweg, Dominic",Journal of aerosol medicine and pulmonary drug delivery,55,5

Reliable gestational age estimates are useful for quantifying population burdens of preterm birth and informing allocation of resources to address the problem. However, evaluating gestational age in low-resource settings can be challenging, particularly in places where access to ultrasound is limited. Our group has developed an algorithm using newborn screening analyte values derived from dried blood spots from newborns born in Ontario, Canada for estimating gestational age within one to two weeks. The primary objective of this study is to validate a program that derives gestational age estimates from dried blood spot samples (heel-prick or cord blood) collected from health and demographic surveillance sites and population representative health facilities in low-resource settings in Zambia, Kenya, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. We will also pilot the use of an algorithm to identify birth percentiles based on gestational age estimates and weight to identify small for gestational age infants. Once collected from local sites, samples will be tested by the Newborn Screening Ontario laboratory at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) in Ottawa, Canada. Analyte values will be obtained through laboratory analysis for estimation of gestational age as well as screening for other diseases routinely conducted at Ontario's newborn screening program. For select conditions, abnormal screening results will be reported back to the sites in real time to facilitate counseling and future clinical management. We will determine the accuracy of our existing algorithm for estimation of gestational age in these newborn samples.

Surgical treatment options depend largely on location and characteristics of the atheroma (s), and generally include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with or without stent placement, posterior circulation revascularization (bypass), extracranial vertebral artery reconstruction, or vertebral artery endarterectomy. CASE DESCRIPTION We present the case of a 56-year-old male with progressive vertebrobasilar ischemia due to tandem lesions in the right vertebral artery at the origin and intracranially in the V4 segment. The contralateral vertebral artery was occluded to the level of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and posterior communicating arteries were absent. Following PTA and stent placement at the right vertebral artery origin, the patient was successfully treated with intradural vertebral artery endarterectomy (V4EA) and patch angioplasty via the far lateral approach. Distal endovascular intervention at the V4 segment proved not technically feasible after multiple attempts.

Deploying the stent retriever by actively pushing it into the thrombus increases the radial force with which the stent struts expand into the thrombus. OBJECTIVE To examine the active push deployment (APD) technique in an in vitro model and present our clinical experience with this technique. METHODS In an in vitro experiment we investigated the configuration of a Solitaire and a Trevo ProVue device (both 4×20 mm), depending on whether the devices were deployed using the APD technique or simple unsheathing. We retrospectively assessed the effectiveness and safety of this technique by analyzing 130 patients with large vessel occlusions (carotid T or M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery), who received endovascular treatment with a Trevo device (4×20 mm) that was deployed using the APD technique. RESULTS In vitro experiment: the APD technique improved apposition of the devices to the vessel wall. There was widening of 30% (Trevo) and 19% (Solitaire) at the cost of a shortening of 5% and 4%, respectively, when the devices were deployed in a carotid T model. Clinical study: the revascularization rate (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction ≥2b) with the Trevo device was 90%. There were no retriever-associated dissections or perforations in 278 retrieval maneuvers. CONCLUSIONS The APD technique improves apposition of the tested devices to the vessel wall. The widening effect comes at the cost of minimal shortening of the devices. Our clinical experience shows that using the APD technique to deploy the Trevo device is effective and safe.","Wiesmann, Martin; Brockmann, Marc-Alexander; Heringer, Sarah; Müller, Marguerite; Reich, Arno; Nikoubashman, Omid",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,55,16

METHODS A standardized non-pylorus preserving PD was performed with or without fibrin glue applied to each anastomosis. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients were randomized: 32 with and 25 without TISSEEL. There were no statistical differences in each group with respect to drain lipase levels (high 40% versus 43%, P = 0.794), complications including gastric or biliary leaks (24% versus 28%, P = 1.00), wound infection (16% versus 9%, P = 0.28) and a Clavien score of 3 or more (16% versus 25%, P = 0.757) or hospital stay (12 versus 17 days, P = 0.777). Most patients with elevated drain lipase levels had an unaltered clinical course not predictive of adverse outcomes. However, the operative finding of a soft pancreas (27 out of 57 patients) was associated with post-operative complications (P = 0.002). There were no peri-operative deaths. CONCLUSIONS Fibrin glue application to all anastomoses does not alter drain lipase levels. Drain lipase levels are not a significant surrogate marker for clinically significant anastomotic leaks or complications. Fibrin glue application did not reduce the incidence of an anastomotic leak or complications.","Martin, Ian; Au, Kenneth",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,55,20

In the natural medium, precipitation of secondary minerals also often take place on seeds. In this context, we have devised a formalism which accounts for the competition between seed growth and nucleation and growth of secondary particles in an initially over-saturated aqueous solution. Based on the classical nucleation theory, it involves a size-dependent growth law which accounts for Ostwald ripening effects, unlike most water-rock interaction codes. We find that, in such closed system, seed growth and nucleation/growth of secondary particles are strongly coupled. In the multi-dimensional parameter space, regions where one or the other process prevails are well-separated by a rather abrupt transition. In general, the value of the initial seed total surface area is insufficient to fully orientate the synthesis. Relying on this approach, we propose an alternative interpretation of recent experimental results on amorphous silica nanoparticle synthesis. Besides fundamental understanding of the kinetics of precipitation, the interest of the present approach is to serve as a guideline to experimentalists or industrialists working in seed-mediated syntheses and warn on the undesired formation of secondary particles when monodispersed distributions of nano- or micro-particles are searched.","Noguera, C; Fritz, B; Clément, A; Lemarchand, D",Journal of colloid and interface science,55,20

To what extent this is accounted for by weight loss or other factors remains elusive. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we investigated the effects of RYGB on β-cell function and β-cell mass in the pig, a species highly reminiscent of the human. RYGB was performed using linear staplers during open surgery. Sham-operated pigs were used as controls. Both groups were fed a low-calorie diet for 3 weeks after surgery. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed 2 weeks after surgery. Body weight in RYGB pigs and sham-operated, pair-fed control pigs developed similarly. RYGB pigs displayed improved glycemic control, which was attributed to increases in β-cell mass, islet number, and number of extraislet β-cells. Pancreatic expression of insulin and glucagon was elevated, and cells expressing the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor were more abundant in RYGB pigs. Our data from a pig model of RYGB emphasize the key role of improved β-cell function and β-cell mass to explain the improved glucose tolerance after RYGB as food intake and body weight remained identical.","Lindqvist, Andreas; Spégel, Peter; Ekelund, Mikael; Garcia Vaz, Eliana; Pierzynowski, Stefan; Gomez, Maria F; Mulder, Hindrik; Hedenbro, Jan; Groop, Leif; Wierup, Nils",Diabetes,55,17

They represent the first nidoviruses to be discovered in insects. Here, we report the molecular characterization of four novel mesoniviruses, Hana virus, Méno virus, Nsé virus, and Moumo virus, all of which were identified in a geographical region in Côte d'Ivoire with high CavV prevalence. The viruses were found with prevalences between 0.5 and 2.8%, and genome sequence analyses and phylogenetic studies suggest that they represent at least three novel species. Electron microscopy revealed prominent club-shaped surface projections protruding from spherical, enveloped virions of about 120 nm. Northern blot data show that the four mesoniviruses analyzed in this study produce two major 3'-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs containing two types of 5' leader sequences resulting from the use of different pairs of leader and body transcription-regulating sequences that are conserved among mesoniviruses. Protein sequencing, mass spectroscopy, and Western blot data show that mesonivirus particles contain eight major structural protein species, including the putative nucleocapsid protein (25 kDa), differentially glycosylated forms of the putative membrane protein (20, 19, 18, and 17 kDa), and the putative spike (S) protein (77 kDa), which is proteolytically cleaved at a conserved site to produce S protein subunits of 23 and 57 kDa.

A survey using a standardized questionnaire, which included 25 questions on knowledge, behaviors and skills regarding infectious diseases, was conducted in the general population of Tibet, China between September 2011 and November 2011. The 25 questions formed the index system of the instrument assessing IDSHL (total scores: 25 scores). Factors associated with index scores of IDSHL were identified by general linear model. The association between the index score of IDSHL and the occurrence of the five selected infectious disease symptoms (fever, diarrhea, rash, jaundice or conjunctivitis) were investigated using multivariate unconditional logistic regression. Among 5717 eligible participants in the survey, 4631 participants completed all of the 25 questions in the instrument. The instrument was reliable and valid as measured by the Cronbach's alpha coefficient and split-half coefficient, and the confirmatory factor analysis. Only 1.0% (48/4631) answered ≥80% of the 25 questions correctly (score ≥ 20).

Case description A 51-year-old man who had received a kidney transplant and was on immunosuppressant medication, was admitted to a critical care unit with severe COVID-19 pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which required intubation, mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. The course was complicated by the classic pentad of thrombocytopenia, intravascular haemolysis, acute kidney injury, neurological symptoms and fever, which prompted the diagnosis of probable TTP. After five sessions of therapeutic plasma exchange, the patient's general status improved, he was weaned off mechanical ventilation and his renal panel and haemolytic markers normalized. Conclusion TTP is a life-threatening condition which requires urgent management with therapeutic plasma exchange.

Despite a plethora of information on the Internet, there is little supporting evidence and no human studies. The risk of multiplex ventilation is that ventilation and PEEP effects are largely uncontrollable and depend on the difference between patient resistance, (R) and compliance (C). It is not clear whether volume control or pressure control is safer or more effective. We designed a simulation-based study to allow complete control over the relevant variables to determine the effects of various degrees of RC imbalance on tidal volume (VT), end-expiratory lung volume (VEE), and imputed pH. METHODS Two separate breathing simulators were ventilated with a ventilator using pressure control (PC) and volume control (VC) breaths. Evidence-based lung models simulated a range of differences in R and C (six pairs of simulated patients). Differences in VT, VEE, and imputed pH were recorded. RESULTS Depending on differences in R and C, differences in VT ranged from 1% (equal R and C) to 79%. Differences in VEE ranged from 2% to 109%. Differences in pH ranged from 0% to 5%. Failure due to excessive tidal volume (> 8 mL/kg) did not occur. Failure due to excessive VEE difference (> 10%) was evident in 50% of patient pairs. There was no difference in failure rate between VC and PC. CONCLUSIONS These experiments confirmed the potential for markedly different ventilation and oxygenation for patients with uneven respiratory system impedances during multiplex ventilation. Three critical problems must be solved to minimize risk: (1) partitioning of inspiratory flow from the ventilator individually between the two patients, (2) measurement of VT delivered to each patient, and (3) provision for individual PEEP. We provide suggestions for solving these problems.","Chatburn, Robert L; Branson, Richard D; Hatipoğlu, Umur",Respiratory care,55,30

The study design was consistent with the NTP 13-week toxicity studies. Harlan Sprague-Dawley (HSD) rats and their offspring and B6C3F1/N mice were assigned to control (unenriched) and enriched experimental groups. Body weight, food and water consumption, behavioral observations, fecal content, clinical pathology, gross pathology, organ weights, and histopathology were evaluated. Enriched male mice and male and female rats exhibited decreased feed intake without a subsequent decrease in body weight; this may have been the result of the nesting material reducing the effect of cold stress, thereby allowing for more efficient use of feed. There were statistical differences in some hematological parameters; however, these were not considered physiologically relevant since all values were within the normal range. Gross pathology and histopathological findings were background changes and were not considered enrichment-related. Nesting material and shelters were used frequently and consistently and allowed animals to display species-typical behavior. There was no significant impact on commonly measured end points in HSD rats and B6C3F1/N mice given enrichment devices.","Churchill, Sheba R; Morgan, Daniel L; Kissling, Grace E; Travlos, Gregory S; King-Herbert, Angela P",Toxicologic pathology,55,31

The Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min were 9 and 10 points, respectively. PATIENTS AND METHODS The mother of the newborn was exposed to a patient with COVID-19 five days before delivery. The newborn had nausea and vomiting after birth, with feeding intolerance, and full enteral feeding was given on the 6th day after birth. The newborn was in good general condition during the period of hospitalization. RESULTS The two 2019-nCoV nucleic acid tests of the newborn were negative on the 5th and 7th days after birth. On the 1st and 8th days after birth, typical pulmonary lesions were detected in the newborn by chest CT. Our study supports that chest imaging examination should be actively performed in the newborn even with a negative 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test in cases where a pregnant woman is exposed to a patient with COVID-19 or is confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection.

However, thorough interrogation of the interplay between infected cells and the immune system at sites of infection is lacking. We use high parameter imaging mass cytometry9 targeting the expression of 36 proteins, to investigate at single cell resolution, the cellular composition and spatial architecture of human acute lung injury including SARS-CoV-2. This spatially resolved, single-cell data unravels the disordered structure of the infected and injured lung alongside the distribution of extensive immune infiltration. Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration are hallmarks of bacterial pneumonia and COVID-19, respectively. We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects predominantly alveolar epithelial cells and induces a localized hyper-inflammatory cell state associated with lung damage. By leveraging the temporal range of COVID-19 severe fatal disease in relation to the time of symptom onset, we observe increased macrophage extravasation, mesenchymal cells, and fibroblasts abundance concomitant with increased proximity between these cell types as the disease progresses, possibly as an attempt to repair the damaged lung tissue. This spatially resolved single-cell data allowed us to develop a biologically interpretable landscape of lung pathology from a structural, immunological and clinical standpoint.

We sought to evaluate the causes of failure in a contemporary CTO PCI registry. METHODS We examined 380 consecutive patients who underwent CTO-PCI at 4 high volume CTO PCI centers in the United States using the ""hybrid"" approach. Clinical, angiographic, complication, and efficiency outcomes were compared between successful and failed cases. Failed cases were individually reviewed by an independent reviewer to determine the cause of failure. RESULTS Procedural success was 91.3%. Compared with patients in whom CTO PCI was successful, those in whom CTO PCI failed had similar baseline clinical characteristics, but were more likely to have longer occlusion length, more tortuosity, more proximal cap ambiguity and blunt stump, and higher mean J-CTO scores (2.8 ± 1.1 vs. 3.5 ± 1.0, P < 0.001), and less likely to have collaterals suitable for the retrograde approach (66% vs. 45%, P = 0.021). Failure was due to a complication in 10 cases (30%). In the remaining 23 cases (70%) failure was due to inability to wire the lesion (n = 21, 4 of which were CTOs due to in-stent restenosis), or poor antegrade flow after PCI (n = 5). CONCLUSIONS Compared with successful cases, failed CTO-PCI cases are more likely to have higher J-CTO scores, longer occlusion length, ambiguous proximal cap and no appropriate collaterals for retrograde crossing.

BACKGROUND Overcrowding in Emergency Departments has been one of the most prominent issues arising in these units for more than 20 years. However, it has become even more problematic due to the novelty of the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced hospitals to recruit larger numbers of beginner nursing staff as the number of quarantined health professionals increases. METHODS Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted in Spanish Emergency Departments, which were analyzed and synthesized using content analysis. RESULTS Three major themes emerged from the data analysis, (a) Fears and concerns, (b) Organizational issues and (c) Support for novice nurses. CONCLUSIONS Our findings may help to understand how shadowing periods as a learning program for nurses, continuing professional development, evidence-based apps and better planning are needed to ensure both novice nurses' confidence in Emergency Departments and expert emergency room nurses' ability to cope with complications in critical situations.

This is closely associated with the immunological status of the host. This study aimed to understand the innate cellular immunity as the first-line defense mechanism in response to HEV infection. Phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, a hallmark of the activation of antiviral interferon (IFN) response, was observed in the liver tissues of the majority of HEV-infected patients but not in the liver of uninfected individuals. In cultured cell lines and primary liver organoids, we found that HEV RNA genome potently induced IFN production and antiviral response. This mechanism is conserved among different HEV strains, including genotypes 1, 3, and 7 as tested. Interestingly, single-stranded HEV RNA is sufficient to trigger the antiviral response, without the requirement of viral RNA synthesis and the generation of an RNA replicative form or replicative intermediate. Surprisingly, the m7 G cap and poly A tail are not required, although both are key features of the HEV genome. Mechanistically, this antiviral response occurs in a retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-independent, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5-independent, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein-independent, and β-catenin-independent but IRF3-dependent and IRF7-dependent manner. Furthermore, the integrity of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway is essentially required. CONCLUSION HEV infection elicits an active IFN-related antiviral response in vitro and in patients, triggered by the viral RNA and mediated by IFN regulatory factors 3 and 7 and the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription cascade; these findings have revealed new insights into HEV-host interactions and provided the basis for understanding the pathogenesis and outcome of HEV infection.

This study proposed a novel peroxomonosulfate (PMS) amended iron coagulation process and found its effectiveness in eliminating TrOCs in synthetic and natural waters. In synthetic waters containing hydroquinone (HQ) or benzoquinone (BQ), Fe(III)/PMS effectively degraded carbamazepine (CBZ), a representative of resistant TrOCs. The step of reduction of Fe(III) to form Fe(II) governed the degradation rate of CBZ as PMS activation by Fe(II) was the dominant reaction to generate SO4•-, which was the major reactive oxidant in the system. Meanwhile, HQ was quickly transformed to BQ in the Fe(III)/PMS system and BQ acted as an electron shuttle to induce Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox cycle and accelerate PMS activation. Natural organic matter (NOM) bearing phenolic and quinone moieties played similar roles as HQ and BQ and fast CBZ degradation was also observed. Finally, two surface waters spiked CBZ were subjected to bench-scale experimentation to simulate coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation processes in water treatment plants. Compared to the conventional iron coagulation process, the PMS-amended iron coagulation process increased the removal percentage of CBZ by 50%-80%. Overall, this study demonstrates that PMS enhanced iron coagulation is a promising process for the abatement of TrOCs in water treatment.","Wang, Yu; Pan, Tao; Yu, Yafei; Wu, Yang; Pan, Yanheng; Yang, Xin",Water research,55,11

Methods A case series for a food poisoning investigation and an environmental survey were conducted. The patients and their relatives were interviewed in person with a questionnaire contained on a digital tablet, and an investigation of the patients' home was conducted in the presence of police officers. Probable case and confirmed case were defined to serve as a basis for identifying additional cases. Confirmed cases were defined as those probable cases in which blood, stool or vomitus specimens tested positive for paliperidone palmitate and/or its metabolites. A descriptive analysis was performed. Follow-up by telephone was conducted four months later. Results There were six probable cases. The median age was 35 years (range: 5-76 years). The attack rate was 100% (n = 6/6) of persons who consumed a family dinner, and the hospitalization rate was also 100% (n = 6/6). The median period between exposure and symptom onset was two hours. The main symptoms included vomiting, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness and severe abdominal pain for adults, and vomiting and severe lethargy for children. An 8-year-old girl further showed changes in the ST segment of her electrocardiogram, and a 5-year-old boy showed QT prolongation. The poisoning substance was suspected to be paliperidone palmitate based on the patients' symptoms and epidemiological findings. Discussion We investigated the household food poisoning outbreak through epidemiological analysis and an environmental investigation and determined that it was caused by paliperidone palmitate. The source of the paliperidone palmitate was found to be aluminium containers, taken home by the eldest son who worked at a pharmaceutical company. The containers were sent to a drug disposal centre, and the pharmaceutical company was required to enhance the regulation on the pharmaceutical waste materials to prevent drug poisoning events.

The present study aimed to quantify the effects of phenylephrine and ephedrine on cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen in brain tumor patients. The authors hypothesized that phenylephrine reduces cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen in selected brain regions compared with ephedrine. METHODS In this double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, 24 anesthetized patients with brain tumors were randomly assigned to ephedrine or phenylephrine treatment. Positron emission tomography measurements of cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen in peritumoral and normal contralateral regions were performed before and during vasopressor infusion. The primary endpoint was between-group difference in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen. Secondary endpoints included changes in cerebral blood flow, oxygen extraction fraction, and regional cerebral oxygen saturation. RESULTS Peritumoral mean ± SD cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen values before and after vasopressor (ephedrine, 67.0 ± 11.3 and 67.8 ± 25.7 μmol · 100 g · min; phenylephrine, 68.2 ± 15.2 and 67.6 ± 18.0 μmol · 100 g · min) showed no intergroup difference (difference [95% CI], 1.5 [-13.3 to 16.3] μmol · 100 g · min [P = 0.839]). Corresponding contralateral hemisphere cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen values (ephedrine, 90.8 ± 15.9 and 94.6 ± 16.9 μmol · 100 g · min; phenylephrine, 100.8 ± 20.7 and 96.4 ± 17.7 μmol · 100 g · min) showed no intergroup difference (difference [95% CI], 8.2 [-2.0 to 18.5] μmol · 100 g · min [P = 0.118]). Ephedrine significantly increased cerebral blood flow (difference [95% CI], 3.9 [0.7 to 7.0] ml · 100 g · min [P = 0.019]) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (difference [95% CI], 4 [1 to 8]% [P = 0.024]) in the contralateral hemisphere compared to phenylephrine. The change in oxygen extraction fraction in both regions (peritumoral difference [95% CI], -0.6 [-14.7 to 13.6]% [P = 0.934]; contralateral hemisphere difference [95% CI], -0.1 [- 12.1 to 12.0]% [P = 0.989]) were comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS The cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen changes in peritumoral and normal contralateral regions were similar between ephedrine- and phenylephrine-treated patients.

Circularity endows 3'-5'-linked circRNAs with stability and resistance to exonucleolytic degradation which raises the question whether circRNAs may be relevant as potential therapeutic targets or agents. High stability in biological systems is the most remarkable property and a major criterion for why circRNAs could be exploited for a range of RNA-centered medical applications. Even though various biological roles and regulatory functions of circRNAs have been reported, their in-depth study is challenging because of their circular structure and sequence-overlap with linear mRNA counterparts. Moreover, little is known about their role in viral infections and in antiviral immune responses. We believe that an in-depth and detailed understanding of circRNA mediated viral protein regulations will increase our knowledge of the biology of these novel molecules.

The outbreak is generating the need to provide assistance to infected patients and in parallel to treat all nondeferrable oncological and urgent benign diseases. A panel of Italian urologists agreed on possible strategies for the reorganization of urological routine practices and on a set of recommendations that should facilitate a further planning of both inpatient visits and surgical activities during the COVID- 19 pandemic. According to this only urgent benign and nondeferrable oncological activities have been kept. MATERIALS AND METHODS We have considered urgent outpatient visits requested by Emergency Department (ED) or by General Practitioner (GP) and emergency surgical procedures performed in our Urology Unit from March 9th to April 14th 2020, during COVID-19 pandemic. These figures have been compared to those observed last year from March 9th to April 14th 2019. RESULTS Our data show that urgent care visits decreased during COCID-19 pandemic (from 293 to 179). Urgent care visits of patients who accessed directly to the ED decreased (from 219 to 107) whereas the number of urgent care visits referred by GP remained unchanged (74 vs 72). Consequently, the rate of visits from ED decreased from 75% to 60% and the rate of visit requested by GP increased from 25% to 40% (p = 0.001). Particularly, the rate of visits for renal colic, LUTS and other not precisely defined disorders from ED decreased and the corresponding rates of visits of patients referred by GPs increased significantly (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0180 and p = 0.0185, respectively). The rate of visits for acute urinary retention, hematuria, sepsis, acute scrotum, cystitis, prostatitis and genito-urinary trauma from ED and GP remained unchanged. Finally, urgency endourology and surgical activities have been stable in relation to the same period last year. CONCLUSIONS Urological emergency activities during COVID- 19 pandemic are more appropriate since urgent outpatients' visits required by ED are decreased and emergency surgical and endourological procedures are stable.","Cicerello, Elisa; Mangano, Mario S; Cova, Giandavide; Zordani, Alessio","Archivio italiano di urologia, andrologia : organo ufficiale [di] Societa italiana di ecografia urologica e nefrologica",55,1

In this study, we retrospectively compared CT-guided hook wire localization and electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) localization of small pulmonary nodules before resection. Patients who underwent localization with CT-guided hook wire or ENB followed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) at Qilu Hospital of Shandong University between January 2016 and December 2019 were retrospectively included. Clinical parameters, complication and failure rate, and localization time were compared between two groups. A total of 157 patients underwent the localization procedure successfully. Pulmonary nodules were localized by CT-guided hook wire in 105 patients and by ENB in 52 patients. The nodule size in ENB group was smaller than that in CT-guided localization group (P < 0.001). Both CT-guided localization and ENB localization were well tolerated in all patients, while ENB localization leaded to less complications (P = 0.0058). In CT-guided localization group, 6 patients failed to be located while none failed in ENB group (P = 0.079). The procedure time was 15.15 ± 3.70 min for CT-guided localization and 21.29 ± 4.00 min for ENB localization (P < 0.001). CT-guided localization is simple and feasible for uncertain pulmonary nodules before surgery. ENB localization could identify small lung nodules with high accuracy and achieve lower incidence of complications.","Tian, Yu; Wang, Cong; Yue, Weiming; Lu, Ming; Tian, Hui",Scientific reports,55,1

This study was conducted to determine if there was any contamination in the spaces (floors and door handles) between the hospital exit and the antineoplastic drugs (ADs) preparation and administration units. At the same time, the authors proposed a new automation of the analytical procedure to considerably decrease the time needed for sample preparation and analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS To evaluate the ADs contamination of surfaces, 829 wipe tests were performed in a campaign involving 3 hospitals located in Italy. Sampling was performed using an innovative kit. The levels of ADs were measured in each wipe sample using liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole. RESULTS On-line solid-phase extraction guarantees the construction of a robust and reproducible analytical method. The CP and IP recoveries from stainless steel, polycarbonate and polyvinyl chloride ranged >80%, and the wipe holders and the automation tested ensured desorption efficiencies close to 100% for both the ADs. Of the 552 wipes taken on the spaces between the hospital exit and the preparation, administration and pharmacy warehouse units, 22 were greater than or equal to the limit of quantification, all adjacent to the administration units. CONCLUSIONS This study provides an insight into the exposure situation against ADs residues. In order to improve environmental monitoring programs, the authors propose to evaluate the ADs contamination also outside the preparation, administration and pharmacy warehouse units.

To answer this question, we conducted a spatial meta-analysis by overlaying seven global biodiversity templates to identify conservation priority zones. These are then combined with low human impact areas to identify cost-effective zones (CEZs) for PA designation. CEZs cover around 38% of global terrestrial area, of which only 24% is currently covered by existing PAs. To protect more CEZs, we propose three scenarios with conservative, moderate, and ambitious targets, which aim to protect 19, 26, and 43% of global terrestrial area, respectively.

Even in robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS), mesorectal division is difficult in a narrow pelvic cavity. To overcome this difficulty, we invented a novel method of mesorectal division. In this new approach, we switched the fenestrated bipolar forceps and the double-fenestrated forceps with each other so that both instruments were placed on the same (right) side of the patient. After the mesorectal fat and vessels were coagulated using the fenestrated bipolar forceps, coagulated tissues were divided using the monopolar scissors in the same direction. We named this technique the ""simple switching technique (SST)"". We retrospectively collected data and evaluated the usefulness of SST in 24 consecutive patients who underwent RALS TSME between July 2018 and January 2020. Twelve patients underwent SST, and 12 patients underwent other conventional surgical methods (non-SST). The median operation time for mesorectal division was 809.5 s (range 395-1491 s) in the SST group and 985.5 s (range 493-2353 s) in the non-SST group. The coefficient of variation for non-SST was 0.545, which was > 1.5 times the coefficient of 0.360 for SST. Although no significant differences were found for operation time for mesorectal division, the operation time for mesorectal division by SST tended to be shorter than by non-SST (P = 0.157). No significant differences were found regarding short-term outcomes between the groups.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of psychological interventions for treating co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders in older adults. METHOD The study was registered (PROSPERO CRD4201603834), databases systematically searched (MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, PubMed, Cochrane Reviews) and articles screened according to PRISMA guidelines. INCLUSION Participants aged ≥60 years with clinically significant anxiety and depression, psychological intervention evaluated against control in randomised controlled trial, changes in both anxiety and depression reported at post-treatment. RESULTS Four studies were included (total n = 255, mean age range 67-71 years). Overall, psychological interventions (CBT, mindfulness) resulted in significant benefits over control conditions (active, waitlist) for treating depression in the presence of co-occurring anxiety (Hedges' g = -0.44), and treating anxiety in the presence of depression (Hedges' g = -0.55). However, conclusions are limited; the meta-analysis was non-significant, few studies were included, several were low quality and there was high heterogeneity between studies. Benefits at follow-up were not established. CONCLUSION Co-occurring anxiety and mood disorders can probably be treated simultaneously with psychological interventions in older adults with moderate effect sizes, however, more research is needed. Given comorbidity is common and associated with worse clinical outcomes, more high-quality clinical trials are needed that target the treatment of co-occurring anxiety and mood disorders, and report changes in diagnostic remission for both anxiety and mood disorders independently.

Heparan sulfate moieties are attached to the cell surface via heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) which are composed of a protein core bound to multiple heparan sulfate chains. HSPGs contribute to the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix and participate in cell signaling by releasing bound cytokines and chemokines once cleaved by an enzyme, heparanase. HSPGs are often exploited by viruses during infection, particularly during attachment and egress. Loss or inhibition of HSPGs initially during infection can yield significant decreases in viral entry and infectivity. In this review, we provide an overview of HSPGs in the lifecycle of multiple viruses, including herpesviruses, human immunodeficiency virus, dengue virus, human papillomavirus, and coronaviruses.","Koganti, Raghuram; Memon, Abdullah; Shukla, Deepak",Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,55,29

To assess the current racial demographics of the pain medicine pipeline, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of medical school matriculants and graduates, residents, and pain fellows in 2018.

The zygote therefore eliminates one set of maternal chromosomes (but not the paternal chromosomes) into the polar body through meiosis, but how the paternal chromosomes are protected from maternal meiosis has been unclear. Here we report that RanGTP and F-actin dynamics prevent egg-sperm fusion in proximity to maternal chromosomes. RanGTP prevents the localization of Juno and CD9, egg membrane proteins that mediate sperm fusion, at the cell surface in proximity to maternal chromosomes. Following egg-sperm fusion, F-actin keeps paternal chromosomes away from maternal chromosomes. Disruption of these mechanisms causes the elimination of paternal chromosomes during maternal meiosis.

DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING 12 centers in eight countries. PARTICIPANTS 955 patients with, or at risk of, atherosclerotic disease who underwent non-cardiac surgery. INTERVENTIONS Coronary computed tomographic angiography was performed preoperatively; clinicians were blinded to the results unless left main disease was suspected. Results were classified as normal, non-obstructive (<50% stenosis), obstructive (one or two vessels with ≥ 50% stenosis), or extensive obstructive (≥ 50% stenosis in two vessels including the proximal left anterior descending artery, three vessels, or left main). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Composite of cardiovascular death and non-fatal myocardial infarction within 30 days after surgery (primary outcome). This was the dependent variable in Cox regression. The independent variables were scores on the revised cardiac risk index and findings on coronary computed tomographic angiography. RESULTS The primary outcome occurred in 74 patients (8%). The model that included both scores on the revised cardiac risk index and findings on coronary computed tomographic angiography showed that coronary computed tomographic angiography provided independent prognostic information (P=0.014; C index=0.66). The adjusted hazard ratios were 1.51 (95% confidence interval 0.45 to 5.10) for non-obstructive disease; 2.05 (0.62 to 6.74) for obstructive disease; and 3.76 (1.12 to 12.62) for extensive obstructive disease. For the model with coronary computed tomographic angiography compared with the model based on the revised cardiac risk index alone, with 30 day risk categories of <5%, 5-15%, and >15% for the primary outcome, the results of risk reclassification indicate that in a sample of 1000 patients that coronary computed tomographic angiography would have resulted appropriately in 17 net patients receiving a higher risk estimation among the 77 patients who would have experienced the primary outcome (P<0.001). Coronary computed tomographic angiography, however, would have resulted inappropriately in 98 net patients receiving a higher risk estimation, among the 923 patients who would not have experienced the primary outcome (P<0.001). Among patients who had a perioperative myocardial infarction, preoperative coronary anatomy showed extensive obstructive disease in 31% (22/71), obstructive disease in 41% (29/71), non-obstructive disease in 24% (17/71), and normal findings in 4% (3/71). CONCLUSIONS Though findings on coronary computed tomographic angiography can improve estimation of risk for patients who will experience perioperative cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction, findings are more than five times as likely to lead to an inappropriate overestimation of risk among patients who will not experience these outcomes. Perioperative myocardial infarction occurs across the spectrum of coronary artery disease, suggesting that there could be several pathophysiologic mechanisms.","Sheth, Tej; Chan, Matthew; Butler, Craig; Chow, Benjamin; Tandon, Vikas; Nagele, Peter; Mitha, Ayesha; Mrkobrada, Marko; Szczeklik, Wojciech; Faridah, Yang; Biccard, Bruce; Stewart, Lori K; Heels-Ansdell, Diane; Devereaux, P J",BMJ,55,14

To mobilize sustainable funding for global CGH, it is critical first to understand existing financing flowing to different types of global CGH. In this study, we estimate trends in international spending for global CGH in 2013, 2015, and 2017, encompassing the era before and after the Ebola epidemic. We use a measure of international funding that combines official development assistance (ODA) for health with additional international spending on R&D for diseases of poverty, a measure called ODA+. We classify ODA+ into funding for three global functions-provision of global public goods, management of cross-border externalities, and fostering of global health leadership and stewardship-and country-specific aid. International funding for global functions increased between 2013 and 2015 by $1.4 billion to a total of $7.3 billion in 2015. It then declined to $7.0 billion in 2017, accounting for 24% of all ODA+ in 2017. These findings provide empirical evidence of the reactive nature of international funders for global CGH. While international funders increased funding for global functions in response to the Ebola outbreak, they failed to sustain that funding.

A contribution of other cellular components, such as natural killer (NK) cells and natural killer T (NKT) cells, for costimulation blockade-induced xenograft survival has not been clearly defined. We therefore tested the hypothesis that NK or NKT cells would promote rat islet and skin xenograft acceptance in mice. METHODS Lewis rat islets or skin was transplanted into wild type B6 mice or into B6 mice that were Jalpha18(null), CD1(null), or beta2 microglobulin (beta2M)(null) NK 1.1 depleted, or perforin(null). Graft recipients were pretreated with an infusion of donor derived spleen cells and a brief course of anti-CD154 mAb treatments. Additional groups received mAb or cells only. RESULTS We first observed that the depletion of NK1.1 cells does not significantly interfere with graft survival in C57BL/6 (B6) mice. We used NKT cell deficient B6 mice to test the hypothesis that NKT cells are involved in islet and skin xenograft survival in our model. These mice bear a null mutation in the gene for the Jalpha18 component of the T-cell receptor. The component is uniquely associated with NKT cells. We found no difference in islet xenograft survival between Jalpha18(null) and wild type B6 mice. In contrast, median skin graft survival appeared shorter in Jalpha18(null) recipients. These data imply a role for Jalpha18(+) NKT cells in skin xenograft survival in treated mice. In order to confirm this inference, we tested skin xenograft survival in B6 CD1(null) mice because NKT cells are CD1 restricted. Results of these trials demonstrate that the absence of CD1(+) cells adversely affects rat skin graft survival. An additional assay in beta2M(null) mice demonstrated a requirement for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression in the graft host, and we demonstrate that CD1 is the requisite MHC component. We further demonstrated that, unlike reports for allograft survival, skin xenograft survival does not require perforin-secreting NK cells. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that MHC class I(+) CD1(+) Jalpha18(+) NKT cells promote the survival of rat skin but not rat islet xenografts. These studies implicate different mechanisms for inducing and maintaining islet vs. skin xenograft survival in mice treated with donor antigen and anti-CD154 mAb, and further indicate a role for NKT cells but not NK cells in skin xenograft survival.","Gordon, Ethel J; Kelkar, Vinaya",Xenotransplantation,55,12

It is a chronic disease that occurs because of ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"". The entire world has witnessed a very bad phase of life which has never happened before on this massive scale. COVID-19 has made the entire human life challenging. Millions of people got affected around the globe and many lost their loving ones while fighting with the deadly disease. The two critical challenges of the pandemic are: there are no known treatments for COVID-19 and secondly, its transmission from one person to another is very prompt. Therefore, to control the deadly spread of the pandemic the countries have adopted complete lockdown for months, people were isolated and quarantined to control the spread of the disease. Several terminologies such as lockdown, quarantine, social-distancing, home isolation, and Corona waves can be heard around. In all these necessary measures to control the virus taken by the government the entire humankind suffered and still suffering from several challenges towards living a normal life. In this entire disaster, information communication technologies (ICTs) have shown a significant contribution in mitigating the effects and challenges caused due to COVID-19. In the present study, efforts have been given on highlighting the role of ICT in overcoming the challenges of life caused due to COVID-19 with the help of studies that took place in the pandemic duration. The study has also shown that how the extensive inclination of the people towards the use of ICTs helped in emerging new business opportunities. The present study is a conceptual study that will help in leading to another study. A research model has been proposed in the study which can be further tested in upcoming studies. The outcomes of the study can be helpful for the decision and policymakers especially those who are working in the area of ICT. The ICT industry can learn many things that can help focus more on the expansion of business opportunities.","Sharma, N.

While guidelines are available regarding implementation of telepharmacy services, there is limited practice-level evidence demonstrating successful adoption of telepharmacy for the delivery of clinical pharmacy services. Objectives: The purpose of this article is to provide a description of how telehealth has been utilized to deliver pharmacy services within a Community Health Center (CHC), to discuss the impact of telehealth services, and to provide a framework by which other entities may create successful telehealth programs within the ambulatory care setting. Methods: Overall CHC productivity, clinical pharmacist productivity, and patient demographics were compared between the 7 months preceding and the 7 months after implementation of telehealth services. Patient satisfaction with telehealth was measured via anonymous surveys administered via Feedtrail XM and provider satisfaction was measured via a survey created by the New Jersey Primary Care Association. Results: Telepharmacy has caused a shift in the demographics of patients receiving pharmacy services, increasing the proportion of patients with private insurance, who were 65 years or older, and who were non-English speakers. While overall productivity at the CHC remained stable, the number of clinical pharmacy encounters increased. Patients were satisfied with telepharmacy visits indicating that they were of the same or greater quality than in-person visits and expressed a preference to continue telepharmacy visits in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that telepharmacy is an effective way to deliver care particularly around chronic conditions. To be sustainable, telehealth requires ongoing support from local, State, and Federal agencies in terms of maintaining regulations around expanded scopes of practice and in terms of reimbursement.","McCarthy, C.; Bateman, M.

To investigate whether wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) workers and residents living in close proximity to a WWTP have elevated carriage rates of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, as compared to the general population. Methods. From 2018 to 2020, we carried out a cross-sectional study in Germany, the Netherlands, and Romania among WWTP workers (N=344), nearby residents (living [≤] 300 meters away from WWTPs; N=431) and distant residents (living [≥] 1000 meters away = reference group; N=1165). We collected information on potential confounders via questionnaire. Culture of participants' stool samples was performed with ChromID(R)-ESBL agar plates and species identification with MALDI-TOF-MS. We used logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for carrying ESBL-producing E. coli (ESBL- EC). Sensitivity analyses included stratification by country and interaction models using country as secondary exposure. Results. Prevalence of ESBL-EC was 11% (workers), 29% (nearby residents), and 7% (distant residents), and higher in Romania (28%) than in Germany (7%) and the Netherlands (6%). Models stratified by country showed that within the Romanian population, WWTP workers are about twice as likely (aOR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.22-4.5) and nearby residents about three times as likely (aOR = 3.17, 95% CI: 1.8-5.59) to be ESBL-EC carriers, when compared with distant residents. Conclusions. In stratified analyses by country, we found an increased risk for carriage of ESBL-EC in Romanian workers and nearby residents. This effect was higher for nearby residents than for workers, which suggests that, for nearby residents, factors other than the local WWTP could contribute to the increased carriage.","Rodriguez-Molina, D.; Berglund, F.; Blaak, H.; Popa, M.; Flach, C.-F.; Kemper, M.; Marutescu, L.; Pircalabioru, G.; Spiessberger, B.; Weinmann, T.; Wengenroth, L.; Chifiriuc, M.

However, there is emerging evidence that suggests that STRs have highly localised impacts. In this article, we use the natural experiment of the pause in tourism caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the impact of a decrease in STR listings on rental markets in the case study city of Hobart, Australia. We find that rental affordability has improved in Hobart’s STR-dense suburbs with the increased vacancies from the underutilised STR properties. These results provide evidence of the impact of STRs on local housing markets when analysed on a finer scale than the whole-of-city approach.

HABs are often found in waterways near residences, therefore, aerosolized HAB toxins can potentially affect both indoor and outdoor air quality. Given that HABs are predicted to increase worldwide, effective mitigation strategies are needed to prevent the inhalation of aerosolized HAB toxins. In this work, we characterized both the particle filtration efficiency using particle sizing instruments as well as the mass concentration of different congeners of aerosolized microcystin (MC) toxins that penetrate through commercially available face masks and air conditioner (AC) filters. Particles were generated from cultures of the toxin-producing cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa. Hydrophobic congeners of microcystin including MC-LF and MC-LW were enriched in aerosols compared to water, with MC-LR being the most abundant, which has implications for the toxicity of inhalable particles generated from HAB-contaminated waters. Particle transmission efficiencies and toxin filtration efficiencies scaled with the manufacturer-provided filter performance ratings. Up to 80% of small, microcystin-containing aerosols were transmitted through AC filters with low filter performance ratings. In contrast, both face masks as well as AC filters with high filter performance ratings efficiently removed toxin-containing particles to below limits of quantification. Our findings suggest that face masks and commercially available AC filters with high filtration efficiency ratings are suitable mitigation strategies to avoid indoor and outdoor air exposure to aerosolized HAB toxins. This work also has relevance for reducing airborne exposure to other HAB toxins, non-HAB toxins, pathogens, and viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gaston, C.

However, on the whole these behavioral interventions have been somewhat underwhelming, exposing an inherent brittleness that comes from three common ""errors of projection"" in current behavioral design methodology: Projected stability, which fails to recognize that interventions often function within inherently unstable systems;projected persistence, which neglects to account for changes in those system conditions over time;and projected value, which assumes that definitions of success are universally shared across contexts. Borrowing from strategic design and futures thinking, a new proposed strategic foresight model-behavioral planning-allows practitioners to better address these system-level, anticipatory, and contextual weaknesses by more systematically identifying potential forces that may impact behavioral interventions before they have been implemented. Behavioral planning will help designers more effectively elicit signals indicating the emergence of forces that may deform behavioral interventions in emergent COVID-19 contexts, and promote ""roughly right"" directional solutions at earlier stages in solution development to better address system shifts. © 2021 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

Therefore, comfort in residential space is crucial to the occupant. As researchers have found traces, that the virus is airborne, the air quality in the residence must be highlighted, especially for people who live in a centralized cooling system residence. When the cooling system is well maintained, there is no significant risk of viral transmission, but not all residential building has HEPA-filters, nor a well-maintained system. This research focuses on the studio room apartment unit, as it has the smallest opening area compared to other room types. A small one-sided opening is not ideal for the wind to move throughout the room. A few design suggestion is simulated under three air-flow speed, to prove that natural ventilation is possible to be adapted, to reach comfort while minimizing the risk of viral transmission. The result is, the indoor wind speed can be enhanced the most at the overall unit area by modifying the fixed window to an operable window, giving upper horizontal opening in the wall across the existing opening, and using gauze doors on both door openings. The furniture layout is proved to affect wind distribution in the room.

The first case of COVID-19 in Poland has been detected on 4th March 2020 and 16 days later Polish government introduced an epidemic state connected with new law regulations and with lockdown. Objectives: Fast shared new coronavirus was a challenge for all. People with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) in very short time lost their sense of security. They received different information about COVID-19. One of the main information was that people with RMDs have higher risk of COVID-19. Providing real information in era of fake-news and giving of possible solutions during pandemic has become the goal of activities of patients organizations. Methods: Lack of appropriate knowledge about new coronavirus forced different activities among entities acting for the benefit of patients. Our rheumatic patients organizations suspended group exercises and face to face meeting counting that it was only for 1-2 months. In social media from early March 2020 we support action stay at home like a warranty of safety. We tried to stay in contact with member organizations and in regional organizations with their members. We participated in action Patient units us organized by Minister for Patients Rights -during duty hours we had a chance to inform calling us people about different solutions connected with pandemic. Using our social media we inform people with RMDs about statement of EULAR and Polish Society for Rheumatology. After short break we are continuing works in Council of Patients Organization to the Minister for Patients Rights. Having contacts with RMDs patients we learn from them about their problems met in everyday lives. Results: COVID-19 pandemic interrupted typical activities of our associations. After summer holidays we could organize group exercises and real meetings only during 2 months to new wave of coronavirus. Many members resigned from participation fear of infection. For the same reason people resigned from medical consultation and examination. Following confirmed information we could share it among our followers using websites and social media. Majority of medical consultations was remotely when physician calls to patient on time of appointed visit. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic accelerated progress of e-health and of using of new technologies. On the one hand it give a challenge for people who didn't use it before to start to do it but on the other hand digital exclusion has deepened among people who never use Internet and stay alone in pandemic times. Virtual activities of associations give a chance to keep a contact with members, increase their knowledge, dispel doubts. Some changes forced by coronavirus infection are good and will stay among us like e-prescription, e-referral, internet patients account, virtual workshops and lectures. We are concerned that teleconsultations can replace medical examination in out-patient center. It can be danger for people with inflammatory arthritis. So long break in face to face meetings in associations can be a reason of lost of members especially older. Fast learning of using of new technology in medicine and in activities of associations give an opportunity for future but nothing can replace personal contact.","Grygielska, J.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,55,16

Methods 12,590 single epithelial cells from three independently processed organ donors were evaluated for organ-specific lineage biomarkers, differentially regulated genes, receptors, and drug targets. Analyses focused on intrinsic cell properties and capacity for response to extrinsic signals along the gut axis across different humans. Result Cells were assigned to 25 epithelial lineage clusters. Human intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are not specifically marked by many murine ISC markers. Lysozyme expression is not unique to human Paneth cells (PCs), and PCs lack expression of expected niche-factors. BEST4+ cells express NPY and show maturational differences between SI and colon. Tuft cells possess a broad ability to interact with the innate and adaptive immune systems through previously unreported receptors. Some classes of mucins, hormones, cell-junction, and nutrient absorption genes show unappreciated regional expression differences across lineages.

Rheumatology services had to rapidly adapt to virtual consultations at the onset of the pandemic. However, providing a high quality and effective service in a virtual setting can be challenging and therefore its prudent to do a formal review and gain patient feedback to ensure that these clinics are fit for purpose. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of first wave of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with autoimmune rheumatic conditions, assess delivery of rheumatology outpatient care and record patient feedback. Methods: This study included patients on the Rheumatology clinic lists between 3rd and 31st August 2020. An electronic survey questionnaire was developed and the survey link was sent to patients via a text message using secure IT platform. Data was collected on patient demographics, diagnosis, comorbidities, treatments, clinical/ laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment interruption, impact on work, personal protective measures taken and views on virtual consultations. Results: 307 patients responded with 287 complete responses. 73.1%(223) were female and 32.4% (99) were ≥65 years of age. Rheumatoid arthritis was the most common diagnosis 41.6%(127). Hypertension was the commonest comorbidity 21.4%(64) followed by Chronic lung disease 17.3%(52). 28.8%(85) were on Hydroxychloroquine, 26.7%(79) Methotrexate, 14.2%(42) Sulfasalazine and 13.2%(39) on Prednisolone. 22.3%(66) were on Biologics: Anti TNF 12.8%(38), Tocilizumab 3.7%(11) and Rituximab 3%(9). 52.6%(161) shielded, 16.9%(55) self-isolated and 30.3%(93) only maintained social distance. 197 patients self reported as being vulnerable but based on their treatment,only 167 patiemts met the clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) criteria and all of those received government shielding letter. 3.6%(11) had lab confirmed COVID-19, 3.2%(10) had clinically suspected COVID-19 infection. 14.3% (43) had their treatment interrupted. 4.6%(14) were unable to work from home or maintain social distancing at work. 59.8%(182) had face-to-face consultation changed to virtual. 63.2%(189) were satisfied, 28%(84) neutral and 8.7%(26) reported dissatisfaction with their consultation. 50.5%(153) were happy to continue with virtual consultation but with an option of face to face only if necessary.For consultations post COVID-19, 59.4%(182) preferred a mixture of face to face and virtual appointments. Conclusion: Majority of our patients seem happy with virtual consultations as long as they are assured of a face-to-face consultation if needed. A minority(8.7%) however, were dissatisfied. Some of the suggestions were, use of video consultations and improvement in communication before the virtual appointments. Our survey also shows that our patients have adapted well to virtual consultations and many are keen to have virtual consultation in the longer term. In our survey, only 6.8%(21) patients reported definite or clinically suspected COVID-19. Possible explanations for this include strict compliance with government advice on social distancing/shielding and limited testing at the onset of the pandemic. More patients assumed themselves to be clinically CEV than those who were actually CEV based on their treatment which is not surprising because of high level of anxiety among patients due to rapidly spreading pandemic and multiple sources of information. This feedback provides useful data which will help us to plan the delivery of rheumatology services post COVID-19 pandemic. While face-to-face patient contact is needed for comprehensive disease assessment, teaching and training, a model for the future is likely to include a combination of face-to-face and virtual consultations. This could allow a greater capacity to see new patients and reduce waiting lists. Patients with uncomplicated and stable disease could be followed up in virtual clinics. There is also a need to formally incorportate the virtual consultations into the curriculum for Rheumatology trainees.","Asif, R.; Elndari, N.; Negi, A.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,55,16

Methods and Results: In 23 vaccinated subjects, we documented high anti-SARS-CoV2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody titers. Average virus neutralization by antibodies, assessed as inhibition of ACE2 binding to RBD, was 2.2-fold reduced for delta mutant vs. wt RBD. Specific CD4+ T cell responses as measured using stimulation with peptides representing wt or alpha, beta, gamma and delta variant SARS-CoV2 entire spike proteins by flow cytometric intracellular cytokine staining, did not differ significantly between vaccinees. One year post infection in one of the earliest SARS-CoV2 populations in the Western world, mean specific antibody titers were lower than in vaccinees; ACE2 binding to delta mutant vs. wt RBD was 1.65-fold reduced. T cell responses, especially interferon gamma expression, to mutant SARS-CoV2 spike were significantly reduced compared to those in vaccinees. Conclusion: Strong T cell responses occurred for wildtype and mutant SARS-CoV2 variants, including delta (B.1.617.2), in fully vaccinated individuals, whereas they were partly reduced 1 year after natural infection. Antibody neutralisation of delta mutant was reduced compared to wt, as assessed in a novel inhibition assay with a finger stick drop of blood. Hence, immune responses after vaccination are stronger compared to those after naturally occurring infection, pointing out the need of the vaccine to overcome the pandemic.","Richardson, J.

Safety concerns associated with JAKi's, such as the increased risk for thrombosis and viral infections, have emerged worldwide. The underlying explanatory mechanisms remain unknown, suggesting the elevated risk is likely due to underlying confounding or an off-target binding effect. Computational approaches can explore the potential for a small molecule drug to interact with previously unknown biological targets and identify potential safety-related concerns, and open doors for potential drug repurposing. Objectives: To identify and characterize the off-target binding effects of baricitinib and tofacitinib, with a focus on targets related to thrombosis and viral infection Methods: Potential targets of baricitinib and tofacitinib were predicted using two neural-network-based systems (TIGER[1] and SPiDER[2]). Targets were considered relevant if they had (1) a SPiDER confidence with p<0.05, or (2) a TIGER score >1. Selected targets related to the outcome of interest were experimentally evaluated at Eurofins Cerep (France-Celle L'Evescault, www.eurofins. com) if commercial available. Compounds were tested at (1) single concentration (30 μM) with technical replicates, using radioligand or enzymatic assays, or (2) multiple concentrations (30 μM highest concentration;dilution factor in a logscale) with technical replicates, using calcium flux or inhibition of [cAMP] assays. Observed activity of ≥50% inhibition or stimulation on the target was considered active, between 25 to 50% inhibition (or a dissociation constant [Kd] from 1 to 10 μM) was considered as moderate activity, and lower than 25% was considered inactive. Dose-response curve were performed on active and moderate targets for IC50 / EC50 (half maximal inhibitory / effective concentration) determination. Results: TIGER and SPiDER suggested a total of 99 off-target binding effects (baricitinib n=41;tofacitinib n=58), of which 17 targets had potential impact on thrombosis or viral infection (baricitinib n=5 and 4, respectively;tofacitinib n=5 and 3, respectively). Commercial testing was available on 11 targets (Adenosine Receptor A2A [AA2AR], Epidermal growth factor receptor, induclible NOS, PI3 Kinase (p110b/p85a), Phosphodiesterase 10A2 [PDE10A2] and Protein Kinase N2 [PKN2] for baricitinib;and Adenosine receptor A3, 15-Lipoxygenase [15-LO], PKN2, Transient receptor potential cation channel [TRPM6] and AA2AR for tofacitinib). Of these, 5 targets showed active or moderately active binding activity (baricitinib n=2;tofacitinib n=3), and were tested for dose-response curves. Test results confirmed ligand-binding activity with IC50 on nanomolar (PKN2), and micromolar ranges (PDE10A2 and TRPM6). Conclusion: The results suggest both baricitinib and tofacitinib are promiscuous binders with effects on several families. Although it may lead to side effects, off-target binding also represents a potential opportunity for drug repurposing. Besides on-target effects, both drugs are under clinical investigation for the treatment of COVID-19 due to off-target interactions. The proposed pharmacological off-target effects of those with active binding include attenuation of pulmonary vascular remodeling, anti-fibrotic and anti-psychotic activities (PDE10A2), modulation of viral response (PKN2), and hypomagnesaemia (TRPM6), which is involved in cardiovascular diseases. This study supports tofacitinib and baricitinib as candidates for drug repurposing (e.g., in COVID-19, Hepatitis C virus, and pulmonary hypertension). We did not identify active off-target interactions linked to thrombosis to explain the elevated risk observed in clinical practice. Further research is required to elucidate the underlying patient-specific factors (confounders) that could explain this safety concern.","Faquetti, M.

(Special Issue: Communicating risk and uncertainty in the face of COVID-19.),15.173952,4.00918,2020,"Accurate temporal land use mapping provides important and timely information for decision making for large-scale management of land and crop production. At present, temporal land cover and crop classifications within a study area have neglected the differences between subregions. In this paper, we propose a classification rule by integrating the terrain, time series characteristics, priority, and seasonality (TTPSR) with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Based on the time series of Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Vegetation Index (NDVI), a dynamic decision tree for forests, cultivation, urban, and water was created in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for each subregion to extract cultivated land. Then, with or without this cultivated land mask data, the original classification results for each subregion were completed based on composite image acquisition with five vegetation indices using Random Forest. During the post-reclassification process, a 4-bit coding rule based on terrain, type, seasonal rhythm, and priority was generated by analyzing the characteristics of the original results. Finally, statistical results and temporal mapping were processed. The results showed that feature importance was dominated by B2, NDWI, RENDVI, B11, and B12 over winter, and B11, B12, NDBI, B2, and B8A over summer. Meanwhile, the cultivated land mask improved the overall accuracy for multicategories (seven to eight and nine to 13 during winter and summer, respectively) in each subregion, with average ranges in the overall accuracy for winter and summer of 0.857–0.935 and 0.873–0.963, respectively, and kappa coefficients of 0.803–0.902 and 0.835–0.950, respectively. The analysis of the above results and the comparison with resampling plots identified various sources of error for classification accuracy, including spectral differences, degree of field fragmentation, and planting complexity. The results demonstrated the capability of the TTPSR rule in temporal land use mapping, especially with regard to complex crops classification and automated post-processing, thereby providing a viable option for large-scale land use mapping.","Wang, Lijun Wang Jiayao Qin Fen",Remote Sensing,55,20

Design/methodology/approach This study uses a qualitative process-tracing approach and combines inductive historical narratives and deductive reasoning to draw theoretical implications concerning the COVID-19 crisis' impact on the standard-setting process. Findings The paper shows a growing reliance on practical expedients in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to maintain the IASB's output legitimacy. While introducing some theoretical flaws, practical expedients increase the standards' flexibility and strengthen the IASB's ability to respond to the European political bodies' concerns. Indeed, an analysis of the IASB's response to the COVID-19 outbreak reveals the role practical expedients might play not only in reducing (ex ante) new IFRS transition costs but also in dealing (ex-post) with the broader economic impact of unexpected systemic crises to limit criticisms and controversies surrounding IFRS. Originality/value This study reveals a causal relationship between the rise of the European public good criterion in the EU endorsement process and the wider use of practical expedients in IFRS. An analysis of the latest amendment to IFRS 16 in response to the COVID-19 crisis also confirms the role of practical expedients in strengthening the acceptance of IFRS in an increasingly complex economic reality and sheds some light on the new strategies adopted by the IASB to preserve its legitimacy in the EU.","Moscariello, N.; Pizzo, M.",Accounting Auditing &amp; Accountability Journal,55,16

Despite its relevance, the detection of recent balancing selection from genomic data is challenging as its signatures are qualitatively similar to those left by ongoing positive selection. In this study we developed and implemented two deep neural networks and tested their performance to predict loci under recent selection, either due to balancing selection or incomplete sweep, from population genomic data. Specifically, we generated forward-in-time simulations to train and test an artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). ANN received as input multiple summary statistics calculated on the locus of interest, while CNN was applied directly on the matrix of haplotypes. We found that both architectures have high accuracy to identify loci under recent selection. CNN generally outperformed ANN to distinguish between signals of balancing selection and incomplete sweep and was less affected by incorrect training data. We deployed both trained networks on neutral genomic regions in European populations and demonstrated a lower false positive rate for CNN than ANN. We finally deployed CNN within the MEFV gene region and identified several common variants predicted to be under incomplete sweep in a European population. Notably, two of these variants are functional changes and could modulate susceptibility to Familial Mediterranean Fever, possibly as a consequence of past adaptation to pathogens. In conclusion, deep neural networks were able to characterise signals of selection on intermediate-frequency variants, an analysis currently inaccessible by commonly used strategies.","Isildak, Ulas; Stella, Alessandro; Fumagalli, Matteo",bioRxiv,55,16

One way to do this is to choose individuals to vaccinate based on their location. Methods for this prioritisation include strategies which target those regions most at risk of importing the pathogen, and strategies which target regions with high centrality on the travel network. We use a simple infectious disease epidemic model to compare a risk-targeting strategy to two different centrality-targeting strategies based on betweenness centrality and random walk percolation centrality, respectively. We find that the relative effectiveness of these strategies in reducing the total number of infections varies with the basic reproduction number of the pathogen, travel rates, structure of the travel network, and vaccine availability. We conclude that, when a pathogen has high spreading capacity, or when vaccine availability is limited, centrality-targeting strategies should be considered as an alternative to the more commonly used risk-targeting strategies.","Singer, B.

First, in a chest CT image, the lung contours are corrected for the segmentation of bilateral lungs. Then, the lung contours and areas are obtained from the lung regions. Next, the coarseness, contrast, roughness, and entropy texture features are extracted to confirm the COVID-19 infected regions, and then the lesion contours are extracted from the infected regions. Finally, the texture features and V-descriptors are fused as an assessment descriptor for the COVID-19 severity estimation. In the experiments, we show the feature extraction and lung lesion segmentation results based on some typical COVID-19 infected CT images.

Methods: The study population included well-characterized PD patients with FOG (PD-FOG), without FOG (PD-NoFOG) and healthy controls (HC). CSF was collected using standard protocols. Three Alzheimer's disease-related markers and 10 inflammation-related markers were measured in a Luminex 200 platform. Differences in marker expression across groups were evaluated with multivariate linear models. Results: CSF was collected from PD-FOG (N=12), PD-NoFOG (N=20) and HC (N=11) for analysis. Age was not significantly different between the three groups. Duration of PD was not significantly different between the two PD groups. After adjusting for covariates and multiple comparisons, the anti-inflammatory marker, fractalkine, was significantly decreased in the PD groups compared to HC (P=0.022), and further decreased in PD-FOG compared to PD-NoFOG or HC (P=0.032).

Therefore, collection of this fluid represents a promising, non-invasive method for sampling the distal airspace in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and for facilitating a mechanistic understanding of this devastating disease. The current study protocol was constructed to assess whether this fluid could be sampled from a dedicated device (Anaesthetic Conserving Device [AnaConDa-S], Sedana Medical, Danderyd, Sweden) used to deliver inhaled sevoflurane for sedation in patients with ARDS. Methods and analysis: A total of 30 adult patients within 24 hours of meeting the Berlin criteria for moderate-severe ARDS and receiving inhaled sevoflurane as standard sedation in participating centres will be eligible for inclusion into this investigator-initiated, exploratory, prospective, bicentre study. After at least 12 h of inhaled sedation, a sample of directly aspirated, undiluted pulmonary oedema fluid will be collected concurrently with fluid from the AnaConDa-S device. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-8, TNF- and sTNFr-1) and markers of lung endothelial (Ang-2) and epithelial (sRAGE) injury will be measured in both fluids by Multiplex. The primary endpoint is the correlation between protein markers (IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, sTNFr-1, Ang-2 and sRAGE) measured in the undiluted pulmonary oedema fluid versus the AnaConDa-S fluid. Ethics and dissemination: The study was approved by the appropriate ethics committee (CPP Est I). Informed consent is required. The fluid collection from the AnaConDa-S has potential to foster our understanding of the potential effects of inhaled sedation in clinical ARDS and to open up novel perspectives for prognostic and predictive enrichment in future trials.

Underlying mechanisms of infection variability are poorly understood. Here, we developed image-based single cell measurements to scrutinize the heterogeneity of adenovirus (AdV) infection. AdV delivers, transcribes and replicates a linear double-stranded DNA genome in the nucleus. We measured the abundance of viral transcripts by single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and the incoming ethynyl-deoxy-cytidine (EdC)-tagged viral genome by copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (click) reaction. The early transcripts increased from 2-12 hours, the late ones from 12-23 hours post infection (pi), indicating distinct accumulation kinetics. Surprisingly, the expression of the immediate early transactivator gene E1A only moderately correlated with the number of viral genomes in the cell nucleus, although the incoming viral DNA remained largely intact until 7 hours pi. Genome-to-genome heterogeneity was found at the level of viral transcription, as indicated by colocalization with the large intron containing early region E4 transcripts, uncorrelated to the multiplicity of incoming genomes in the nucleus. In accordance, individual genomes exhibited heterogeneous replication activity, as shown by single-strand DNA-FISH and immunocytochemistry. These results indicate that the variability in viral gene expression and replication are not due to defective genomes but due to host cell heterogeneity. By analyzing the cell cycle state, we found that G1 cells exhibited the highest E1A expression, and significantly increased the correlation between E1A expression and viral genome copy numbers. This combined image-based single molecule procedure is ideally suited to explore the cell-to-cell variability in viral infection, including transcriptional activators and repressors, RNA splicing mechanisms, and the impact of the 3-dimensional nuclear topology on gene regulation. Author Summary Adenoviruses (AdV) are ubiquitous pathogens in vertebrates. They persist in infected people, and cause unpredictable outbreaks, morbidity and mortality across the globe. Here we report that the common human AdV type C5 (AdV-C5) gives rise to considerable infection variability at the level of single cells in culture, and that a major underlying reason is the cell-to-cell heterogeneity. By combining sensitive single molecule in situ technology for detecting the incoming viral DNA and newly synthesized viral transcripts we show that viral gene expression is heterogeneous between infected human cells, as well as individual genomes. We report a moderate correlation between the number of viral genomes in the nucleus and immediate early E1A transcripts. This correlation is increased in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, where the E1A transcripts were found to be more abundant than in any other cell cycle phase. Our results demonstrate the importance of cell-to-cell variability measurements for understanding transcription and replication in viral infections.","Suomalainen, Maarit; Prasad, Vibhu; Kannan, Abhilash; Greber, Urs F.",bioRxiv,55,19

Two novel measures of cognition (No Practice Effects (NPE) cognitive battery and Miami Computerized Functional Assessment Scale (CFAS)) were designed to have robust psychometric properties and reduced practice and ceiling effects. This study aims to evaluate if the NPE and CFAS demonstrate stronger psychometric properties and reduced practice effects compared with established measures, including the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC), Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Methods: This parallel group, four-site study will randomize 320 cognitively intact adults aged 60 to 85 years to novel or well-established measures of cognition and function. All participants will receive assessments at baseline (week 0), week 12, and week 52, as well as a brain MRI scan and Apolipoprotein E genetic test at study entry. Analyses will determine psychometric properties of the NPE and CFAS, compare the sensitivity of measures to AD risk markers, and identify cognitive domains within the NPE. Discussion: Practice effects have been a major limitation of Alzheimers disease clinical trials that typically assess cognitive changes over serial assessments. Detection of functional impairment in cognitively normal individuals with biomarkers for Alzheimers disease requires instruments sensitive to very subtle functional changes.

Methods: A total of 210 patients diagnosed with glaucoma were included. Exclusion criteria was newly diagnosed cases of glaucoma and patients who were non-compliant before lockdown. Patients’ age, gender, marital status, occupation, residence, monthly income bracket, type of glaucoma, duration of glaucoma, number and type of anti-glaucoma medication and any other co-morbidity like diabetes or hypertension were asked from the patient. The patients were evaluated for best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP) and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL). Before lockdown, BCVA, IOP and RNFL thickness were taken from computerized data of our hospital. Patients were asked about the compliance of the anti-glaucoma therapy and the factors that lead to non-compliance (if any). Results: Out of 210 individuals, there were 131 (62.4%) males and 79 (37.6%) females. About 169 (80.5%) patients reported non-compliance to anti-glaucoma drugs during the lockdown period. Non-availability of medicines was the most common reason given by 77 (57.5%) individuals, followed by lack of money by 44 (32.8%) patients. Conclusion: A high proportion of non-compliance to anti-glaucoma therapy was seen in glaucoma patients during pandemic. Low literacy rate, non-availability of medicines and lack of money were major reasons for non-compliance. © 2021, Ophthalmological Society of Pakistan.

As per the government data on 25th March, 2021, a total of 5,55,04,440 doses have been administered as first dose and 85,02,968 as the second dose, which is just a mere fraction of the total population of India which stands at 1.3 billion. As the number of cases are rising, considering the situation, it is important to expedite the drive and follow strict restrictions to achieve herd immunity. A simulation of the SIR model has been created to identify the effective reproduction number (Re), and then through time series analysis using Prophet model, the conclusion has been drawn for the number of days it will take to vaccinate enough population to achieve herd immunity. As an initial step, we will be fitting the data available for COVID-19 for India in the SIR model which is a set of three Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). The results from the ODEs will be used to determining the initial Re which will be matched with the data set. Once confirming the Re value present in data set, the same will be passed to the data-driven forecasting time series model to get insights and draw conclusions which will help authorities to help in planning the drive and implement necessary actions to avoid further growth of COVID-19 cases. © 2021 IEEE.","Darapaneni, N.; Dhua, S.; Khare, N.; Ayush, K.; Karthikeyan, N.; Ghodke, S.; Rajput, A.; Beurik, S.

The TEXAS Coronavirus Antibody REsponse Survey (CARES) is a statewide seroprevalence program which utilizes the Roche S-test to detect antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the Roche N-test to detect antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, to monitor the combined impact of prior infection and the COVID-19 vaccine. The current sample size having both S- and N-test data and reported vaccination status is 8,846. Participants with prior infection (i.e. N+) and with either partial or full vaccination have the highest proportion of those showing the maximum value of the S-test (80.95% and 83.07%, respectively). Using a permutation test, there is no statistically significant difference between the median S-test value for those that have had prior infection and are partially vaccinated versus those that have had prior infection and are fully vaccinated. These groups both show significantly higher median amount compared to the other three groups: N+/not vaccinated, N-/partially vaccinated, and N-/fully vaccinated (all p-values < 0.0001). Unvaccinated individuals with prior infection have one of the lowest median S-test values. For participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and a COVID-19 vaccine, the median S-test value is high and is not statistically different between those who are partially vaccinated and those who are fully vaccinated.","Boerwinkle, E.; Shuford, J.

This study examines the factors underlying the historic oil price fluctuation during the Covid-19 pandemic. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach incorporating a structural break is applied to the daily series from 17 January to 14 September 2020 to analyze long-run relationships and short-run dynamics. The results reveal that increases in Covid-19 pandemic cases, US economic policy uncertainty, and expected stock market volatility contributed to the fall in the WTI crude oil price, whereas the fall in the global stock markets appears to significantly reduce the fall. Furthermore, the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war and speculation on oil futures are shown to play a critical part in the collapse of the oil markets. The findings are consistent with our expectations. Although it is reasonable to assume that the solution to this oil crisis is a pick-up in global oil demand, which will occur only when the novel coronavirus is defeated, this study proposes policy recommendations to cope with the current oil price crash.","Le, Thai-Ha Le Anh Tu Le Ha-Chi",Research in International Business and Finance,55,1

MyRA Touch was pioneered by the Rheumatology Unit of Hospital Tuanku Jaa'far in Seremban Malaysia in March 2018,to engage and empower all RA patients on their own disease activity monitoring. It is an electronic platform, designed to enhanced the application of electronic patient reported outcomes (ePROs) among RA patients where they examine and record their own painful and/or swollen joints for DAS28 calculation and report their health assessment through Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data with 3 Measures (RAPID 3).MyRA Touch is an applications (App) that is user friendly and available in four major spoken languages (English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil) with an animated version for patients who are illiterate. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to determine the correlation between: I)Patient-reported and physician reported DAS28 ESR/CRP II)RAPID3 and Clinical Disease activity Index (CDAI) III)RAPID3 and DAS28 ESR/CRP assessed by physician and patient IV)RAPID3 and inflammatory markers ESR/CRP. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in the Rheumatology Unit of Hospital Tuanku Jaa'far. All data entered through MyRA Touch App from April 2018 till April 2020 was analysed. Results: There were a total of 562 patients who entered the data in the App, 87.9% were women. The ethnic compositions of the study subjects comprised of Indians (36.7%) followed by the Malays (34.7%),Chinese (26.3%) and other ethnics (2.3%). About half of patients (59.8%) were in the 51-70 age group whereas 22.9%,1.8% and 15.5% were in the 31-50,18-30 and above 70 age groups respectively. The majority of our patients (96%) were literate. A total of 54.3% of them received secondary education, 27% primary, 12.2% tertiary and 6.6% did not receive any formal education. There was a high level of correlation between DAS28 ESR/CRP performed by patient and DAS28 ESR/CRP assessed by physician, (r=0.808 for DAS28 ESR and r=0.804 for DAS28 CRP). RAPID3 also showed high level of correlation with CDAI and DAS28 CRP assessed by patient (r=0.700 and r=0.718 respectively). There was a moderate correlation between DAS28 ESR/CRP done by physician with RAPID3 (r=0.656 and r=0.696 respectively).RAPID3 demonstrated little correlation with inflammatory markers ESR and CRP (r=0.141 and r=0.171 respectively). Conclusion: PROs via DAS 28 (ESR/CRP) and RAPID3 showed moderate to high correlation with disease activity assessed by physician. We can empower patients to perform their own disease assessment by using the MyRA Touch App before seeing their physician and the information provided in the App, can help to reduced consultation time. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine is very much encouraged. By using the MyRA Touch, patients can assess their own tender and swollen joint count on a homunculus, evaluate their own physical function, health and pain using the RAPID3 parameters. The information obtained from the PROs in the MyRA touch App enables the physician to make a more comprehensive virtual assessment of the patient's condition which helps in treatment decision making. In conclusion, MyRA Touch is an useful tool for disease activity measurement by patient.","Eow, L. H.; Yew, J.; Lee, K. H.; Selvadurai, S.; Liau, S. M.; Mohd Noor, N.; Mohd, A.; Loh, Y. L.; Gun, S.

This uncertainty manifests itself in significant changes that tend to occur over the lifetime of a process and possibly affect its performance. It is important to understand the root causes of such changes since this allows us to react to change or anticipate future changes. Research in process mining has so far only focused on detecting, locating and characterizing significant changes in a process and not on finding root causes of such changes. In this paper, we aim to close this gap. We propose a framework that adds an explainability level onto concept drift detection in process mining and provides insights into the cause-effect relationships behind significant changes. We define different perspectives of a process, detect concept drifts in these perspectives and plug the perspectives into a causality check that determines whether these concept drifts can be causal to each other. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework by evaluating it on both synthetic and real event data. Our experiments show that our approach unravels cause-effect relationships and provides novel insights into executed processes.","Adams, Jan Niklas; Zelst, Sebastiaan J. van; Quack, Lara; Hausmann, Kathrin; Aalst, Wil M.P. van der; Rose, Thomas",,55,1

In all likelihood the COVID-19 pandemic has added to this risk. Study Objectives: We sought to identify the primary stressors for EM residents during this pandemic and determine which factors and interventions have helped most to improve their wellness. Methods: The setting was an EM residency program in the state with the highest per-capita deaths from COVID-19. All EM residents were surveyed eight months into the pandemic using Google Forms. Surveys were anonymous to promote honesty. Residents were asked about to identify the three factors that had the greatest negative impact on their wellness. They were also asked to identify the three features that did most to improve wellness. Demographic information was collected. Results: 23 of 27 residents (85%) completed the survey. 91% (95% CI 80-100) said the negative impact of the pandemic affects them more socially than professionally. The factors identified most commonly contributing negatively to a resident’s wellness were “decreased socialization/isolation” (74%) and “concerns for family safety” (70%). “Changing hospital protocols” (35%), “feeling under-appreciated at work” (30%), and “public not doing enough to stop the spread” (30%) were also identified frequently as having a negative effect. “Concerns for my own safety” was only identified by 17% of residents as being a top-three issue. The features most commonly identified as helping wellness were “ability to socialize in small groups” (65%), “team mentality” (57%) and “free food” (44%). Conclusion: Overwhelmingly, residents cite the social impact of the pandemic as having a more negative effect on their wellness than work did. Concerns for their own safety are not identified frequently as having a significant impact. Interventions that are social and decrease the sense of isolation appear to be especially important in improving wellness.","Bella, S.; Walsh, B.; Flannery, A.; Fiesseler, F.; Walsh, K.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,55,24

It can easily take on the characteristics and symptoms of a behavioral addiction, such as preoccupation, mental appropriation as well as compulsiveness and loss of control. Thus, shopping addiction is becoming an increasingly important topic in research, especially in the context of the current pandemic (COVID-19). The pandemic has resulted in an increase in perceived risk factors. There is a plausible relationship between high perceived stress level along with perceived social isolation and extensive leisure time in shifting toward a pathological shopping behavior. While that does not only have a negative impact on functional but also on social and financial aspects, findings suggest that the threshold is also becoming lower due to changing social values, including changing self-conception and progressing digitalization that make online shopping more accessible. Although different reasons for an increasing prevalence rate are being discussed, the diagnosis conceptualization and classification is still unclear, leading to different and unstandardized therapeutic approaches. In addition to its impact on daily life, shopping addiction can indicate other mental illnesses. As it turned out, it is often comorbid in anxiety disorders, impulsive behaviors and substance abuse. An early and targeted treatment, as well as rising awareness, seem to be crucial and call for further investigation. While young people seem to be more at risk of developing critical shopping behavior, findings show no clear gender differences in frequency but differences in terms of buying motivation. Based on published research papers, the present narrative review therefore describes and critically discusses the phenomenon of shopping addiction and the current state of research in a broad variety of topics, considering types of shopping behavior, including Internet-based, offline, mood, impulse and leisure shopping, and diagnostic and therapeutic options in the context of influencing factors mentioned above.

In this paper, we introduce the AoI of medical information when allocating channels for users in IoMT. Due to the advantages of Deep Q-learning Network (DQN) applied in resource management in wireless network, we propose a novel DQN-based Channel Allocation (DQCA) algorithm to provide the strategy for channel allocation under the optimization of the system cost considering the AoI and energy consumption of coordinator nodes. Unlike the traditional centralized channel allocation methods, the DQCA algorithm is distributed as each user performs the DQN process separately. The simulation results show that our proposed DQCA algorithm is superior to Greedy algorithm and Q-learning algorithm in terms of the average AoI, average energy consumption and system cost.","Wei, Kefeng Zhang Lincong Wang Shupeng",Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing (Online),55,32

It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) leading to immune activation. Several studies suggest that the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 might interact with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and thereby activate immunity. Here we have investigated the role of TLR4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity. Neither exposure of isolated S protein, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus nor a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced TLR4 activation in a TLR4-expressing cell line. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) express TLR4 but not ACE2, and DCs were not infected by a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Notably, neither S protein nor the primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced DC maturation or cytokines, indicating that both S protein and SARS-CoV-2 virus particles do not trigger extracellular TLRs, including TLR4. Ectopic expression of ACE2 in DCs led to efficient infection by SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, infection of ACE2-positive DCs induced type I IFN and cytokine responses, which was inhibited by antibodies against ACE2. These data strongly suggest that not extracellular TLRs but intracellular viral sensors are key players in sensing SARS-CoV-2. These data imply that SARS-CoV-2 escapes direct sensing by TLRs, which might underlie the lack of efficient immunity to SARS-CoV-2 early during infection. Author summary The immune system needs to recognize pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 to initiate antiviral immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for inducing antiviral immunity and are therefore equipped with both extracellular and intracellular pattern recognition receptors to sense pathogens. However, it is unknown if and how SARS-CoV-2 activates DCs. Recent research suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by extracellular Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We have previously shown that DCs do not express ACE2, and are therefore not infected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that DCs do not become activated by exposure to viral Spike proteins or SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. These findings suggest that TLR4 and other extracellular TLRs do not sense SARS-CoV-2. Next, we expressed ACE2 in DCs and SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected these ACE2-positive DCs. Notably, infection of ACE2-positive DCs induced an antiviral immune response. Thus, our study suggests that infection of DCs is required for induction of immunity, and thus that intracellular viral sensors rather than extracellular TLRs are important in sensing SARS-CoV-2. Lack of sensing by extracellular TLRs might be an escape mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and could contribute to the aberrant immune responses observed during COVID-19.","van der Donk, Lieve E.H.; Eder, Julia; van Hamme, John L.; Brouwer, Philip J.M.; Brinkkemper, Mitch; van Nuenen, Ad C.; van Gils, Marit J.; Sanders, Rogier W.; Kootstra, Neeltje A.; Bermejo-Jambrina, Marta; Geijtenbeek, Teunis B.H.",bioRxiv,55,11

The present study aims to quantify, with the help of the Beck questionnaire, the degree of depression in a group of 109 patients with moderate forms of COVID-19, hospitalised in the Second Clinic of the Clinical Hospital for Infectious Diseases St. Cuv. Parascheva Galati during the period: 1.01-30.03.2021. Of these, 35 patients (32.11%) had raging degrees of depression, and had an age and body mass index statistically significantly higher than those without depression. These patients also had statistically significantly higher Charism scores of cumulative comorbidities and required longer hospitalization than patients without depression. The severity of COVID-19 and the parentage of favorable prognosis did not show statistically significant differences between the two groups. Our study reveals a lower incidence of depression among patients with COVID-19 compared to existing studies in the literature. This can be explained the, by act that our study is conducted at the end of the first year of the pandemic when antiviral therapy schemes stabilised and population vaccination began. The high, genetic variability of the tints, which can determine at any time the appearance of new strains with greater aggression, contagion or with mutations on the spike protein, maintains the need to keep non-specific preventive measures and the mental tension related to this pathology.

Despite notable efforts made by FDA and EMA to expedite development, review and approval of Innovative Medicinal Products (InMPs), there may still be a lengthy delay before oncology patients can gain access to new therapies. Expanded access (EA) in the USA and compassionate use (CU) in the European Union are pathways endorsed to improve patient access to InMPs. Recently reported data from CDER and CBER revealed that applications for EA pathways dealing with patient cohorts remain low, despite high approval rates. The challenges that practicing oncologists may face when dealing with EA or other early access provision (EAP), together with limited education, may influence the access of oncology patients to care. Methods: An on-line, fully anonymous survey reaching out to more than 3,258 practicing physicians was initiated between November 2020- January 2021. Participants were asked questions about their knowledge and understanding of EA/EAP, level of experience, decision process, interest for further educational activities and opportunities to improve process, both in general and specifically during COVID 19 pandemic. Attributes were rated on a 5-point scale. Results: Analysis of first respondents showed that 70% of practicing physicians rated their own understanding and knowledge about EA/EAP as above average (good or very good). However, only 60% of responders answered specific knowledge-based question correctly. At the same time, only 44% of practicing oncologists reported notable experience with EA/EAP in daily practice. The majority of respondents (90%) felt that availability of clinical efficacy data from comparative phase III RCTs would be considered of high importance;other evidence and study types (e.g. clinical safety, PK/PD, preclinical data) were rated substantially lower. The need for further education around better understanding of the processes and regulatory requirements, roles and responsibilities, and data collection was emphasized by 61%, 36% and 30% of respondents, respectively. During current COVID 19 pandemic, majority of respondents highlighted the need to improve and substantially adapt EA with regard to application process and documentation, InMP supply and logistics, and safety reporting process. Conclusions: Results from this survey suggest that challenges posed by the EA process, together with a lack of education, might contribute to the under-utilization of EA/EAP for oncology patients. Continuous educational efforts are required to better inform and support practicing oncologists during the EA application process and regulatory framework. Competent authorities should consider optimization and implementation of digital tools to facilitate EA applications and follow up during the COVID 19 pandemic.","Krendyukov, A.; Singhvi, S.; Green-Morrison, Y.; Zabransky, M.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,55,1

Infection control in dentistry is especially important at the present stage, when the spread of coronavirus infection has not yet been stopped, and the world is already experiencing the third wave of COVID-19. So, today it is very important to evaluate the existing infection control measures taken in dental health organizations, both private and public, and to investigate the measures proposed in the literature to reduce the transmission of both the new coronavirus and other infectious diseases to patients. Infection control measures in dentistry are aimed at minimizing the cross-transmission of mainly blood-borne pathogens. However, the high degree of contagion of the new coronavirus, as well as the possibility of the appearance of such viruses in the future, makes specialists already think about the need to improve infection control measures in order to preserve the health of patients and make dental manipulations as safe as possible for them. This is especially important for elderly patients, in whom complications from coronavirus-like infectious diseases can be fatal. In dental practice, many people are at risk, such as the practitioner, assistants, patients, administrative staff, cleaners, and possibly accompanying people. Standard precautions are usually not sufficient during the active spread of infections, so it is important to use proper PPE and follow hand hygiene. The sequence of consultations and scheduling of appointments with patients, as well as making changes to the waiting area, are also important. To minimize aerosol contamination, mouthwash should be performed before treatment. It should be taken into account that fans with NERA filters can significantly reduce the number of aerosols and, accordingly, reduce the level of pathogenicity of viruses. The aim of the work is to consider the measures proposed in the publications aimed at improving the measures of infection control during dental manipulations.","Fundovnaya, A. A.; Noskova, D.

On March 13, 2020, the Belgian government issued lockdown measures which constrained most people's work and social life to the confines of their own home. For couples who lived together, being locked down together potentially placed a lot of stress on their relationship. As relationship stress can have detrimental (mental) health outcomes, it is important to identify which relationship aspects were particularly stressful during the pandemic lockdown. The present study aimed to investigate whether perceived relationship stress about five specific relationship aspects (i.e., conflict, diverging attitudes, restrictions, less connectedness, and neglect) differed before and during the lockdown, and between men and women. We conducted an online survey study among 2,889 respondents between April 3 and 17, 2020. A total of 1,491 respondents (76.3% female, Mage = 41.23) lived together full-time with their partner at the time. Our findings indicate that during the lockdown, women experienced more relationship stress than men because of conflict and diverging attitudes within their relationship. Furthermore, both men and women experienced more stress during the lockdown than before because they felt restricted in their relationship. Lastly, women reported significantly more perceived relationship stress during the pandemic lockdown compared to before because of conflicts they experienced within their relationship. Our findings provide important information for policymakers and health-care professionals to help couples who endure relationship hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown or in possibly similar situations in future crises.

To assess the effect of meglumine sodium succinate on the effectiveness of basic therapy in correcting gas exchange abnormalities in patients with severe COVID-19 infection complicated by bilateral community-acquired pneumonia. Methods. The analysis of the effectiveness of therapy of 12 patients with a diagnosis of ""New coronavirus infection COVID-19 (confirmed), severe form U07.1. Complication: Bilateral multifocal pneumonia"" was carried out. The patients were divided into two groups: 7 received, as part of standard therapy, a solution of meglumine sodium succinate in a daily dose of 5 ml/kg during stay in the intensive care unit;5 patients received a similar volume of Ringer's solution and formed the control group. In the arterial and venous blood of all patients, the indicators of acid-base state and water-electrolyte balance, glycemia and lactatemia were measured at several stages: (1) at admission to the intensive care unit, (2) 2-4 hours after the start of intensive therapy, (3) after 8-12 hours, (4) after 24 hours. On the 28th day of observation, mortality, the duration of treatment in the intensive care unit and the incidence of thrombotic complications in the groups were assessed. The Friedman nonparametric hypothesis test was used to assess intragroup dynamics, and the nonparametric Mann-hitney U test for intergroup comparisons. Results. In the group of patients who received meglumine sodium succinate, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of thromboembolic events during 28 days of treatment: Myocardial ischemia event rate ratio from 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19-1.16] in the control group to 0.55 (95% CI 0.06-0.81) in the study group at p=0.043;pulmonary embolism event from 0.50 (95% CI 0-1.0) in the control group to 0.28 (95% CI 0-1.0) in the study group at p=0.041.

Some of such drawbacks are improperly usage of representation symbols, incomplete information presented by authors, non-standard representation, absence of essential elements of best practices, non-homogeneous level of specificity, and imprecise denomination of practice. Consequently, in this paper we propose a model of best practice representation by using pre-conceptual schemas. Our model can be applied to any knowledge area with a generic structure and it is appropriate for human and computational comprehension. Our model is intended to allow for completely representing knowledge related to best practices, creating, selecting, updating, extending, and combining best practices.

This study aimed to evaluate executive function following a 6 min bout of walking or rest during prolonged gaming in competitive esports players.Methods12 men and 9 women completed three separate 2-hour gaming session days assigned in randomised order consisting of a 6 min walk break, 6 min rest break and continuous before and after each session. Postintervention participant exit survey data were also collected.ResultsThe walk condition produced a significantly faster mean solution time (7613.6±3060.5 min, p=0.02) and planning time (5369.0±2802.09, p=0.04) compared with the resting condition (9477±3547.4;6924±3247.7) and continuous play (8200.0±3031.6;5862.7±2860.7). The rest condition resulted in the slowest mean solution time (9477.0±3547.4) and planning time (6924.0±3247.7), with the continuous play resulting in a faster mean solution time (8200.1±3031.6) and planning time (5862.7±2860.7) than the rest condition. There was no impact on game performance in any of the conditions. However, over 70% of participants felt that the walk break improved esports performance.ConclusionsReducing sit time and breaking up prolonged sitting have acute and chronic health benefits.

We report data on 72 patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing both before and after kidney transplantation and were followed for a median of 186 days (range 83, 277). Of the 25 patients with a positive antibody test at the time of transplant, 17 (68%) remained positive after transplantation. Patients were significantly more likely to have a persistently positive test if they reported a symptomatic COVID-19 infection prior to transplant (p=0.01). SARS-CoV-2 IgG index values were measured in a subset of kidney transplant recipients and compared to wait -listed dialysis patients. These assays demonstrated a more significant decline in IgG (58% versus 14% p = 0.008) in transplant recipients when compared to dialysis patients tested during the same time period. Additional analysis of the quality of the immune response measuring the binding of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD binding), the antibody neutralizing capability, and the antibody avidity demonstrated a more pronounced effect when comparing pre-transplant values to post-induction therapy/post transplant values. The attenuated IgG response seen in transplant patients compared to dialysis patients after induction therapy requires further study. These data have important implications for post-transplant management of vaccinated dialysis patients.","Lubetzky, M.; Sukhu, A.; Zhao, Z.; Rand, S.; Sharma, V.; Sultan, S.; Kapur, Z.; Albakry, S.; Hauser, N.; Marku-Podvorica, J.; Craig-Schapiro, R.; Lee, J.

Long training times are needed to properly train traditional networks to classify images, as well as the need for large amounts of data for these networks to draw accurate conclusions. Even when supplied with large datasets, popular neural networks like VGG and ResNet fail to classify images accurately and consistently for sensitive tasks like identifying COVID-19 in a CT lung scan. To overcome these challenges, we apply Siamese neural network architecture, which has been reported to reduce training times and required training data, to a sequential network. To further empower this network, we incorporate thick data heuristics into the CT image dataset, specifically, we annotate areas of interest in the images that a radiologist would be looking for to make a diagnosis, such as ground glass opacities. Our network outperforms five leading image classification neural networks by about 3% when classifying the same CT lung scan images as positive or negative for COVID-19. By applying data thickening heuristics, we have shown that accuracy is improved, and suspect that the accuracy will continue to increase as more heuristics based on more radiologists and imaging experts are to be added on top of what we have considered in this paper. © 2021 IEEE.","Sawyer, D.; Fiaidhi, J.; Mohammed, S.","45th IEEE Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2021",55,20

We identify some of the outcomes and barriers of these projects in relation to promoting wellbeing through work, transport, participation and green spaces for food production, biodiversity and recreation. Projects’ achievements are contextualised in light of the urgent imperative to tackle climate change and against a background of social inequality. Liminal community projects are structurally constrained in their potential to create wider systemic changes. However, the projects’ potential to promote wellbeing among their participants can intersect with climate change mitigation when systemic and wide-ranging changes are adopted.

Material and methods: The medical data and computed tomography of the chest of 247 patients with confirmed pneumonia caused by SARS-Cov2 were used. A technique has been developed for determining MMI based on the cross-sectional area of paraspinal muscles at the level of the Th12 vertebra and the length of the thoracic spine. A correlation analysis of MMI calculated based on the length of the thoracic spine MMI(L) and height MMI(H) was performed. A statistical analysis of the differences of the MMI(L) in the groups of male and female patients with fatal outcome and recovered, as well as younger and older than 65 years were performed. Results: A strong correlation was found between the MMI calculated on the basis of the length of the thoracic spine and height (r = 0.861, p &lt;0.001). The age threshold, which was associated with an increase in the likelihood of death, in men was 60 years (Se 77.3 %, Sp 60.5 %, PPV 51.5 %, NPV 83.1 %, Youden's index 0.378, area under ROC- curve 0.728), in women 65 years old (Se 72.2 %, Sp 68.6 %, PPV 49.1 %, NPV 85.5 %, Youden's index 0.408, the area under the ROC curve 0.734). The odds ratio of death when the age thresholds are exceeded was 5.2 for men (95 % CI: 2.3 - 12.0), for women - 5.7 (95 % CI: 2.4 - 13.4). MMI(L) 3.37cm2/m2 is a threshold value, below which the probability of death in male patients under 60 years increased 26.3 times (95 % CI: 4.8 - 143.0). In female patients, there was no statistically significant threshold value of MMI(L), which would be associated with a higher risk of death. Conclusion: MMI, calculated at the level Th12 on the basis of the length of the thoracic spine, can be reliably used as a tool to estimate sarcopenia associated muscle atrophy, if there is no anthropometric data. The MMI(D) less than 3.37 cm2/m2 is a strong predictor of death in men under 60 years of age.

This study evaluated immunity over time. Design, setting, participants, and measurements: This retrospective cohort study included maintenance dialysis patients from a midsize national dialysis provider who received a complete SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series and had at least one antibody titer checked after full vaccination. Immunoglobulin G spike antibodies (SAb-IgG) titers were assessed monthly with routine labs beginning after full vaccination and followed over time; the semiquantitative SAb-IgG titer reported a range between 0 and [≥]20 U/L. Descriptive analyses compared trends over time by prior history of COVID-19 and type of vaccine received. Time-to-event analyses were conducted for the outcome of loss of seroresponse (SAb-IgG < 1 U/L or development of COVID-19). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for additional clinical characteristics of interest. Results: Among 1898 maintenance dialysis patients, 1567 (84%) had no prior history of COVID-19. Patients without a history of COVID-19 had declining titers over time. Among 441 BNT162b2/Pfizer recipients, median [IQR] SAb-IgG titer declined from 20 [5.99-20] U/L in month 1 to 1.30 [0.15-3.59] U/L by month 6. Among 779 mRNA-1273/Moderna recipients, median [IQR] SAb-IgG titer declined from 20 [20-20] in month 1 to 6.20 [1.74-20] by month 6. The 347 Ad26.COV2.S/Janssen recipients had a lower titer response than mRNA vaccine recipients over all time periods. In time-to-event analyses, Ad26.COV2.S/Janssen and mRNA-1273/Moderna recipients had the shortest and longest time to loss of seroresponse, respectively. The maximum titer reached in the first two months after full vaccination was predictive of the durability of the SAb-IgG seroresponse; patients with SAb-IgG titer 1-19.99 U/L were more likely to have loss of seroresponse compared to patients with SAb-IgG titer [≥]20 U/L (HR 23.9 [95% CI: 16.1-35.5]). Conclusions: Vaccine-induced seroresponse wanes over time among maintenance dialysis patients across vaccine types.

A potential target for this strategy is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), for which, despite decades of efforts, no vaccine is available. In particular, a therapeutic vaccine devised to eliminate infected cells would represent a key component of cure strategies. HIV peptides designed based on individual viro-immunological data from people living with HIV/AIDS have recently shown able to induce post-therapy viral set point abatement. However, the reproducibility and scalability of this method is curtailed by the errors and arbitrariness associated with manual peptide design as well as by the time-consuming process. We herein introduce Custommune, a user-friendly web tool to design personalized and population-targeted vaccines. When applied to HIV-1, Custommune predicted personalized epitopes using patient specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles and viral sequences, as well as the expected HLA-peptide binding strength and potential immune escape mutations. Of note, Custommune predictions compared favorably with manually designed peptides administered in a recent phase II clinical trial (NCT02961829). Furthermore, we utilized Custommune to design preventive vaccines targeted for populations highly affected by COVID-19. The results allowed the identification of peptides tailored for each population and predicted to elicit both CD8+ T-cell immunity and neutralizing antibodies against structurally conserved epitopes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Overall, our data describe a new tool for rapid development of personalized or population-based immunotherapy against chronic and acute viral infections.","Tarek, M.; Elhefnawi, M.; Maricato, J.

Methods: A total of 85 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Beijing Youan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to liver function, they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33). Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed. Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8% (33/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and albumin were significantly lower in ALT elevation group. The proportion of severe and critical patients in ALT elevation group was significantly higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed CRP ≥20 mg/L and lymphocyte count< 1.1*10^9/L were independently related to hepatic injury. Conclusions: Lymphopenia and CRP may serve as the risk factors related to hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19, which might be related to inflammatory cytokine storm in liver injury.

Analyzing these data can be for social good. For instance, data analytics on the healthcare and disease data often leads to the discovery of useful information and knowledge about the disease. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) further enhances the interpretability of the discovered knowledge. Consequently, the explainable data analytics helps people to get a better understanding of the disease, which may inspire them to take part in preventing, detecting, controlling and combating the disease.

The predictor component analyzes and mines historical disease and healthcare data for making predictions on future data. Although huge volumes of disease and healthcare data have been generated, volumes of available data may vary partially due to privacy concerns. So, the predictor makes predictions with different methods. It uses random forest With sufficient data and neural network-based few-shot learning (FSL) with limited data. The explainer component provides the general model reasoning and a meaningful explanation for specific predictions.

(Special Issue: COVID-19.),15.170144,3.5964644,2020,"Despite the declaration of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization, till date, no effective treatment has been approved to combat the severity of this pandemic. Few antiviral and antimalarial drugs have been used for symptomatic treatment of COVID-19 infection, but none of the treatment strategies has provided promising results against this infection. As the journey of a vaccine is also very long, there is a need to repurpose the already approved drugs against this pandemic. The urge of studying the structural association of human ACE2, an entry receptor of the virus in the human body with the SARS-CoV-2, may lead to the invention of a new promising prophylactic as well as curative treatment options for the COVID-19 pandemic. This chapter covers the importance of human ACE2 receptors in pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. Finally, the results of various computational studies have been elaborated in this chapter. The role of different classes of already approved drugs which have shown promise against SARS-CoV-2 infection in in silico docking and computational modeling experiments is summarized for their future prospects in the treatment of COVID-19 infection. They were chosen on the basis of their free binding energies and relative ligand scoring scales. Molecular docking tools like molecule operating environment (MOE), Glide, AutoDock Vina, and Swiss dock were used in many in silico experiments. Some of the potential treatment modalities found in literature survey were ACE inhibitors, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and so on, which have been proved to be efficacious treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infection by computational modeling of human ACE2 receptors.","Joshi, R.; Bansal, S.; Malik, D.; Singla, R.; Mishra, A.; Prakash, A.; Medhi, B.",Methods Pharmacol.

A relevant issue within this scope is the clinical trial process. Monitoring and ensuring the integrity of trial data using the traditional system is not always feasible. The search for a vaccine against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 illustrates this situation. The scientific credibility of findings from several vaccines' clinical trials contributed to distorted perceptions concerning the benefits and risks of the drug. This scenario is ideal for applying technologies such as Blockchain and Smart Contracts in healthcare issues. This paper proposes a protocol based on Smart Contracts, named VaccSC, to enable transparency, accounting, and confidentiality to Phase III of vaccine experiments. The protocol was implemented in Solidity language, and results show that the VaccSC enables double-blindness, randomization, and the auditability of clinical data, even in the presence of dishonest participants. © 2021 IEEE.","Da Silva Sendin, I.; Sanches Miani, R.","2021 IEEE International Conference on Omni-Layer Intelligent Systems, COINS 2021",55,16

Through a qualitative thematic and frame analysis of news articles published on 12 Ukrainian news sites, I found that Ukrainian labour migrants conceptually constitute a challenge to such a clear-cut spatial organization in a time of a pandemic. Labour migrants are part of the national ?we,? but their presence in the dangerous outside excludes them from the ?imagined immunity.? This ambiguity is evident in the way labour migrants were portrayed during the first months of the outbreak in Ukraine. Initially, Ukrainian labour migrants were depicted as a potential danger, and then blamed for bringing the virus back home. However, the framing of the labour migrants as a danger is only part of the story, and the image of a scapegoat was eventually replaced with images of an economic resource and a victim. Thus, Ukrainian labour migrants have been the object of vilification, heroization, as well as empathy during the various phases of the outbreak. I would argue that these shifting frames are connected to the ambiguous conceptualization of Ukrainian labour migrants in general.","Tymczuk, Alexander",East European Politics and Societies,55,24

Human genetic information is identifiable and contains sensitive information, but genetic data security is only recently gaining attention. Genetic data is generated in an evolving and distributed cyber-physical ecosystem, with multiple systems that handle data and multiple partners that utilize the data. This paper defines security classifications of genetic information and discusses the threats, vulnerabilities, and risk found throughout the entire genetic information ecosystem. Laboratory security was found to be especially challenging, primarily due to devices and protocols that were not designed with security in mind. Likewise, other industry standards and best practices threaten the security of the ecosystem. A breach or exposure anywhere in the ecosystem can compromise sensitive information.

In the fields of epidemiology and macroevolution these models can be used to estimate, respectively, the past number of infected individuals (prevalence) or the past number of species (paleodiversity) through time. Recent years have seen the development of “total-evidence” analyses, which combine molecular and morphological data from extant and past sampled individuals in a unified Bayesian inference framework. Even sampled individuals characterized only by their sampling time, i.e. lacking morphological and molecular data, which we call occurrences, provide invaluable information to reconstruct past population sizes. Here, we present new methodological developments around the Fossilized Birth-Death Process enabling us to (i) efficiently incorporate occurrence data while remaining computationally tractable and scalable; (ii) consider piecewise-constant birth, death and sampling rates; and (iii) reconstruct past population sizes, with or without knowledge of the underlying tree. We implement our method in the RevBayes software environment, enabling its use along with a large set of models of molecular and morphological evolution, and validate the inference workflow using simulations under a wide range of conditions. We finally illustrate our new implementation using two empirical datasets stemming from the fields of epidemiology and macroevolution. In epidemiology, we apply our model to the Covid-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship. We infer the total prevalence throughout the outbreak, by taking into account jointly the case count record (occurrences) along with viral sequences for a fraction of infected individuals. In macroevolution, we present an empirical case study of cetaceans. We infer the diversity trajectory using molecular and morphological data from extant taxa, morphological data from fossils, as well as numerous fossil occurrences. Our case studies highlight that the advances we present allow us to further bridge the gap between between epidemiology and pathogen genomics, as well as paleontology and molecular phylogenetics.","Andréoletti, Jérémy; Zwaans, Antoine; Warnock, Rachel C.

Central nervous system symptoms are the main form of neurologic injury in patients with COVID-19 and a significant portion of these patients presents with delirium. COVID-19 infection’s course and symptoms, as well as patient comorbidities can facilitate its onset, which is exacerbated by the frequent need for higher doses of sedation to suppress severe cough.ObjectivesTo summarize the most recent practices for management of delirium in COVID-19 infected patients, with emphasis on the psychopharmacology approach.MethodsSelective literature review via PubMed search, using the terms “delirium, neurological disorders, psychopharmacology and COVID-19”.ResultsCOVID-19 associated delirium can be presented in its hyperactive type with exuberant agitation, but also with additional clinical features such as rigidity, akinetic mutism, abulia and alogia. Psychopharmacological approaches may be needed for patients with agitation when there’s intractable stress or risk to self or others. In this group of patients, melatonin, alfa-2 agonists and low potency antipsychotics have been used as first line treatment. Trazodone, valproate, dopamine agonists, amantadine can be used. Other approaches such as correction of vitamin deficiencies and remdesivir can also play a role.ConclusionsDelirium remains frequently unrecognized. In the pandemic context of COVID-19 it is important to consider this infection as a cause of delirium and mind the misdiagnosis as a psychiatric condition. One should look for atypical features and be more thoughtful about the psychopharmacological approach.","Lemos, M.; Rema, J.; Reynolds De Sousa, T.",European Psychiatry,55,19

As further investigation, virus sequence alignment with primers oligonucleotide was analyzed. Design or methods11,652 samples from Japanese population were tested for SARS-CoV-2 positive using recommended RT-PCR primer-probe sets from Japan National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ResultsOf the 102 positive samples, 17 samples (16.7% of total positives) showed inconsistent results when tested simultaneously for the following primers: JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2. As a result, CDC recommended primer-probe sets showed relatively higher sensitivity and accuracy. Further virus sequence alignment analysis showed evidences for virus mutation happening at primers binding sites. ConclusionsThe inconsistency in the RT-PCR results for JPN-N1, JPN-N2, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2 primer-probe sets could be attributed to differences in virus mutation at primers binding site as observed in sequence analysis. The use of JPN-N2 combined with CDC-N2 primer produces the most effective result to reduce false negatives in Japan region. In addition, adding CDC-N1 will also help to detect false negatives.","Tsutae, Wataru; Chaochaisit, Wirawit; Aoshima, Hideyuki; Ida, Chiharu; Miyakawa, Shino; Sekine, Hiroko; Baran, Iri Sato; Furukawa, Toshiharu; Sekine, Akihiro",,55,7

In a typical year, 10-20% of the population of the US is infected by influenza virus, resulting in up to 40,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalisations. Vaccination is the most effective preventative measure that can protect 70-90% of healthy adults aged < 65; however, the protection rate is much lower in those most susceptible to infection, namely infants, the elderly and individuals with weakened immune systems. Although four drugs have been approved by the FDA for use as prophylaxis and/or treatment of influenza, concerns about their side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant viruses persist. RNA interference (RNAi), an emerging method of post transcriptional gene silencing, appears ideal for the prevention and treatment of influenza. RNAi in mammals can be mediated by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of approximately 21-27 nucleotides in length. The authors have previously shown that siRNAs specific for conserved regions of the influenza virus genome are potent inhibitors of influenza virus replication in both cell lines and chicken embryos. This review discusses the recent progress in the in vivo inhibition of influenza virus by the delivery of siRNAs mediated by non-viral vectors, and the prospects of this strategy for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza infection in humans.","Thomas, Mini; Ge, Qing; Lu, James J; Klibanov, Alexander M; Chen, Jianzhu",Expert opinion on biological therapy,55,7

However, COVID-19 has dramatically affected their lives due to many months of school closures intended to prevent the spread of the infection. In the Czech Republic, secondary schools were closed from 14 October 2020 to 24 May 2021 with a short break before Christmas. However, the students were most often infected by their parents, who usually became infected at work. The aim of this study was to find out by means of antibody testing how many high school students in Havlíčkův Brod have undergone the infection. We used questionnaires to find out how many students were in quarantine. The group included 196 students aged 15-19. Examination of IgG antibodies against the S antigen (Abbott, Architect) was performed in June 2021. Antibodies were detected in 90 of 196 students (45.9%). Coronavirus infection was reported in 88 families. Antibodies were detected in 61 quarantined students (69.3%), while the remaining 27 students had neither antibodies, nor clinical signs, nor positive PCR test. Thus, these students are considered unsusceptible to the infection at the time of quarantine. Despite the interruption of teaching in schools and the associated reduction of contacts, a significant share of students met with the coronavirus. About half of the students in the sample are already largely resistant to the disease (have antibodies). Another part of the students was unsusceptible to the disease, because they did not fall sick despite having been in contact with an infected family member.","Fejt, Václav; Krátká, Zuzana; Zelená, Hana; Komárek, Arnošt",Casopis lekaru ceskych,55,19

This mutant, designated Alb4, is both temperature-sensitive and thermolabile, and its N protein is smaller than wild-type N. Sequence analysis of the Alb4 N gene revealed that it contains an internal deletion of 87 nucleotides, producing an in-frame deletion of 29 amino acids. All of these properties of Alb4 made it ideal for use as a recipient in a targeted RNA recombination experiment in which the deletion in Alb4 was repaired by recombination with synthetic RNA7, the smallest MHV subgenomic mRNA. Progeny from a cotransfection of Alb4 genomic RNA and synthetic RNA7 were selected for thermal stability. PCR analysis of candidate recombinants showed that they had regained the material that is deleted in the Alb4 mutant. They also had acquired a five nucleotide insertion in the 3' untranslated region, which had been incorporated into the synthetic RNA7 as a molecular tag. The presence of the tag was directly verified, as well, by sequencing the genomic RNA of purified recombinant viruses. This provided a clear genetic proof that the Alb4 phenotype was due to the observed deletion in the N gene. In addition, these results demonstrated that it is possible to obtain stable, independently replicating progeny from recombination between coronaviral genomic RNA and a tailored, synthetic RNA species. To date, we have constructed three additional mutants by this procedure. For two of these, a second-site point mutation that reverts the Alb4 phenotype has been transduced into a wild type background, which does not contain the Alb4 deletion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Masters, P S; Koetzner, C A; Peng, D; Parker, M M; Ricard, C S; Sturman, L S",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,55,5

The major clinical features include persistent fever, chills/rigor, myalgia, malaise, dry cough, headache and dyspnoea but diarrhea occurs in 40-70% of patients after hospital admission. Respiratory failure is the major complication of SARS; at least half of the patients require supplemental oxygen during the acute phase whereas about 20% of patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive mechanical ventilatory support. In contrast, the severity is generally mild in infected young children. Due to our limited understanding of this new disease, treatment of SARS was empirical in 2003. Protease inhibitor (Lopinavir/ritonavir) in combination with ribavirin may play a role as antiviral therapy in the early phase whereas nelfinavir is a promising alternative.

Resuscitation with centhaquin decreased blood lactate and increased MAP. Protein levels of ET(A) or ET(B) receptor were unaltered in the brain, heart, lung and liver following shock or resuscitation. In the abdominal aorta, shock produced an increase (140 %) in ET(A) expression which was attenuated by saline and centhaquin; ET(B) expression was unaltered following shock but was increased (79 %) by centhaquin. In renal medulla, ET(A) expression was unaltered following shock, but was decreased (-61 %) by centhaquin; shock produced a decrease (-34 %) in ET(B) expression which was completely attenuated by centhaquin and not saline. Shock induced changes in ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in the aorta and renal medulla are reversed by centhaquin and may be contributing to its efficacy.","Briyal, S; Gandhakwala, R; Khan, M; Lavhale, M S; Gulati, A",Physiological research,55,31

Bariatric surgery has long been employed to treat obesity and its related comorbidities. Over time, researchers have amassed significant data to support bariatric surgery in the pursuit of treating diabetes mellitus. This review serves to introduce the most recent findings and their relation to the various bariatric surgical options as bariatric surgery will continue to cement itself in the treatment paradigm of diabetes mellitus. RECENT FINDINGS Numerous studies performed in the past 10 years have demonstrated the improvement or cessation of diabetes with bariatric surgical intervention. In comparing the vertical sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, data demonstrate a more beneficial response of diabetes to the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and an even further exaggerated response with the biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch. The benefit has long been established, but what causes the improvement in diabetes mellitus after bariatric surgery? Recent data suggest a decrease in circulating bile salts as well as changes to inflammatory markers and circulating cytokines. Furthermore, tailoring of existing surgical procedures has led to the development of the SIPS procedure, and its benefit is demonstrated in bypassing a large portion of intestine while eliminating an enteroenterostomy, helping to reduce short gut syndrome and resultant diarrhea. SUMMARY The surgical climate within the bariatric field is changing and will continue to do so in the future. As the understanding of the causes or mechanisms in which bariatric surgery improves metabolic disorders becomes more evident, the process of individualizing care for specific patients will become more prevalent.","Roslin, Mitchell S; Cripps, Courtney N",Current opinion in gastroenterology,55,17

Although the duration of rickettsemia was prolonged in dogs receiving immunosuppressive, but not anti-inflammatory, corticosteroids, concurrent administration of doxycycline and corticosteroids conferred no other detected detrimental effects. Treatment with doxycycline or doxycycline in conjunction with prednisolone resulted in decreased R. rickettsii-specific antibody titers; however, examination of appropriately timed acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples would have facilitated an accurate diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) in all 16 dogs. We conclude that the concurrent use of anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive doses of prednisolone in conjunction with doxycycline, early in the course of experimental RMSF, confers no clinically relevant detrimental effects and that additional studies might be indicated to detect possible beneficial effects in cases of severe or potentially fulminant RMSF. However, because the illness induced in these dogs was of mild to moderate severity, the results of this study should definitely not be construed as supporting the safety or efficacy of prednisolone for treatment of severe canine or human RMSF.","Breitschwerdt, E B; Davidson, M G; Hegarty, B C; Papich, M G; Grindem, C B",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,55,9

However, the sole role of ETX in the intestinal changes of the acute and chronic forms of enterotoxemia in goats remains controversial, and the synergistic action of other C. perfringens toxins has been suggested previously. The current study examined 2 goats that were found dead without premonitory clinical signs. Gross lesions at necropsy consisted of multifocal fibrinonecrotic enterocolitis, edematous lungs, and excess pleural fluid. Histologically, there were multifocal fibrinonecrotic and ulcerative ileitis and colitis, edema of the colonic serosa, and proteinaceous interstitial edema of the lungs. Clostridium perfringens type D carrying the genes for enterotoxin (CPE) and beta2 toxin (CPB2) was cultured from intestinal content and feces of 1 of 2 goats, while C. perfringens type D CPB2-positive was isolated from the other animal. When multiple colonies of the primary isolations from both animals were tested by Western blot, most of the isolates expressed CPB2, and only a few isolates from the first case expressed CPE. Alpha toxin and ETX were detected in ileal and colonic contents and feces of both animals by antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CPB2, but not CPE, was identified in the small and large intestines of both goats by immunohistochemistry. These findings indicate that CPB2 may have contributed to the necrotic changes observed in the intestine, possibly assisting ETX transit across the intestinal mucosa.","Uzal, Francisco A; Fisher, Derek J; Saputo, Juliann; Sayeed, Sameera; McClane, Bruce A; Songer, Glenn; Trinh, Hien T; Fernandez Miyakawa, Mariano E; Gard, Sharon","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",55,5

One technology that has been explored to generate low immunogenicity mAbs for in vivo therapy involves the use of transgenic mice expressing repertoires of human antibody gene sequences. This technology has now been exploited by over a dozen different pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies toward developing new therapeutic mAbs, and currently at least 33 different drugs in clinical testing--including several in pivotal trials--contain variable regions encoded by human sequences from transgenic mice. The emerging data from these trials provide an early glimpse of the safety and efficacy issues for these molecules.

The current view of the system is characterized by an increased complexity, as evidenced by the discovery of new functional components and pathways of the RAS. In recent years, the pathophysiological implications of the system have been the main focus of attention, and inhibitors of the RAS such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin (ANG) II receptor blockers have become important clinical tools in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy. Nevertheless, the tissue RAS also plays an important role in mediating diverse physiological functions. These focus not only on the classical actions of ANG on the cardiovascular system, namely, the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis, but also on other functions. Recently, the research efforts studying these noncardiovascular effects of the RAS have intensified, and a large body of data are now available to support the existence of numerous organ-based RAS exerting diverse physiological effects. ANG II has direct effects at the cellular level and can influence, for example, cell growth and differentiation, but also may play a role as a mediator of apoptosis. These universal paracrine and autocrine actions may be important in many organ systems and can mediate important physiological stimuli. Transgenic overexpression and knock-out strategies of RAS genes in animals have also shown a central functional role of the RAS in prenatal development. Taken together, these findings may become increasingly important in the study of organ physiology but also for a fresh look at the implications of these findings for organ pathophysiology.","Paul, Martin; Poyan Mehr, Ali; Kreutz, Reinhold",Physiological reviews,55,32

To test this hypothesis, we examined whether SDAV-immune rats could be infected with RCV or reinfected with SDAV. Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were inoculated intranasally with SDAV or with culture medium alone and serial SDAV antibody titers were obtained. Eleven months after inoculation, when antibody titers had stabilized, SDAV-immune and nonimmune rats were challenged with SDAV or RCV, and euthanatized 3 or 6 days later. SDAV-immune rats challenged with SDAV or RCV manifested acute rhinitis associated with virus antigen by 3 days after inoculation, but no lesions or antigen were subsequently found in the lower respiratory tract, salivary glands or lacrimal glands. There was also a marked anamnestic increase in antibody titer by 6 days after challenge. SDAV-immune rats challenged with SDAV or RCV also transmitted infection to nonimmune cage mates.

BACKGROUND Recent advancements in single-incision instrumentation have created more interest in and usage of LESS. However, neither LESS nor its novel multichannel access devices have been thoroughly studied. METHOD Using a simulation test bed and standardized laparoscopic surgery task, the user experience of three commercially available LESS devices was compared to conventional laparoscopic ports based on time on task, errors, task success, and perceived ease of use. RESULTS There were no significant differences between devices for time on task, errors, or task success (p > .05). For all devices, there were significantly more recoverable than unrecoverable errors, and errors occurred more frequently during the second phase of the task when the dominant hand was more active (p < .0001). Conventional laparoscopy was rated as easier to use than were the LESS devices (p < .01). CONCLUSION Device performance of a basic laparoscopic task was similar in both conventional laparoscopy and LESS. Each of the LESS devices facilitated efficient and accurate aiming and grasping movements compared to conventional laparoscopy. Further investigation of human factors and ergonomics of LESS is needed to further develop, evaluate, and refine single-site surgery technologies to create a user experience equivalent to conventional laparoscopy. APPLICATION Competitive usability testing of medical devices yields objective performance data that can be used to inform purchase decisions and future device design improvements.","McCrory, Bernadette; Lowndes, Bethany R; LaGrange, Chad A; Miller, Emily E; Hallbeck, M Susan",Human factors,55,16

The most common respiratory virus to infect pregnant women is influenza. All women who intend to become pregnant or are pregnant should receive the influenza vaccine. If a pregnant woman develops influenza she should be treated with supportive care. Antiviral medications should be reserved for cases where the benefits outweigh the risks. Avian influenza (H5N1) is a new emerging virus usually contracted from direct contact with diseased birds. There is no commercially available vaccine at this time to prevent infection. Pregnant women should be treated aggressively with supportive care and antiviral medications, as the significant risk of maternal mortality outweighs the potential fetal risks. Pregnant women diagnosed clinically with severe acute respiratory syndrome should be treated empirically, as a serologic diagnosis can take weeks to confirm. The treatment of pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome should be without ribavirin.","Longman, Ryan E; Johnson, Timothy R B",Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,55,1

Previous reports suggest that these infectious agents may be neurotropic in humans, as they are for some mammals. With the long-term aim of providing experimental evidence for the neurotropism of HuCV and the establishment of persistent infections in the nervous system, we have evaluated the susceptibility of various human neural cell lines to acute and persistent infection by HuCV-229E. Viral antigen, infectious virus progeny and viral RNA were monitored during both acute and persistent infections. The astrocytoma cell lines U-87 MG, U-373 MG, and GL-15, as well as neuroblastoma SK-N-SH, neuroglioma H4, and oligodendrocytic MO3.13 cell lines, were all susceptible to an acute infection by HuCV-229E. The CHME-5 immortalized fetal microglial cell line was not susceptible to infection by this virus. The MO3.13 and H4 cell lines also sustained a persistent viral infection, as monitored by detection of viral antigen and infectious virus progeny. Sequencing of the S1 gene from viral RNA after approximately 130 days of infection showed two point mutations, suggesting amino acid changes during persistent infection of MO3.13 cells but none for H4 cells. Thus, persistent in vitro infection did not generate important changes in the S1 portion of the viral spike protein, which was shown for murine coronaviruses to bear hypervariable domains and to interact with cellular receptor. These results are consistent with the potential persistence of HuCV-229E in cells of the human nervous system, such as oligodendrocytes and possibly neurons, and the virus's apparent genomic stability.","Arbour, N; Ekandé, S; Côté, G; Lachance, C; Chagnon, F; Tardieu, M; Cashman, N R; Talbot, P J",Journal of virology,55,1

This puts healthcare professionals from specialties with close patient contact at high risk of nosocomial infections with SARS-CoV-2. In this context, preprocedural mouthrinses with hydrogen peroxide have been recommended before conducting intraoral procedures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 1% hydrogen peroxide mouthrinse on reducing the intraoral SARS-CoV-2 load. METHODS: Twelve out of 98 initially screened hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were included in this study. Intraoral viral load was determined by RT-PCR at baseline, whereupon patients had to gargle mouth and throat with 20 mL of 1% hydrogen peroxide for 30 s. After 30 min, a second examination of intraoral viral load was performed by RT-PCR. Furthermore, virus culture was performed for specimens exhibiting viral load of at least 103 RNA copies/mL at baseline. RESULTS: Ten out of the 12 initially included SARS-CoV-2-positive patients completed the study. The hydrogen peroxide mouthrinse led to no significant reduction of intraoral viral load. Replicating virus could only be determined from one baseline specimen. CONCLUSION: A 1% hydrogen peroxide mouthrinse does not reduce the intraoral viral load in SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects. However, virus culture did not yield any indication on the effects of the mouthrinse on the infectivity of the detected RNA copies. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The recommendation of a preprocedural mouthrinse with hydrogen peroxide before intraoral procedures is questionable and thus should not be supported any longer, but strict infection prevention regimens are of paramount importance.

Waste recyclers face health hazards which are associated with handling and disposal of waste, a lack of personal protective wear and inaccessibility to occupational health care services. Consequently, accessing health care within the public health care sector is important for health outcomes in this population. This study assesses health care access of informal waste recyclers in South Africa to establish baseline information for health planning for potential inclusion of informal waste recyclers into occupational health services. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of informal waste recyclers in two landfill sites in Johannesburg was conducted from March 2018. A standardized structured questionnaire was used to collect information on sociodemographic details, health care utilization, barriers to access and acceptability and affordability of health care. Factors associated with health care utilization were assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 363 informal waste recyclers were included in the study. Less than half of informal waste recyclers (41.0%) used health care facilities in the last 12 months. Those who accessed services chose to use facilities close to where they live (87.0%). Barriers to accessing health care services included long waiting periods (36.6%), being unable to take time off work (26.3%) and transport problems (13%). In the univariate analysis, factors such as gender and being treated well at the clinic and location of the health care facility were associated with health care utilization (OR: 1.97, p = 0.05, OR: 1.94, p = 0.02, OR: 0.65, p = 0.04 respectively). CONCLUSION: Informal waste recyclers face numerous challenges to accessing health care. Specific to their informal trade, barriers to health care utilization are related to financial repercussions due to the informal nature of their work.","Kistan, Jesne; Ntlebi, Vusi; Made, Felix; Kootbodien, Tahira; Wilson, Kerry; Tlotleng, Nonhlanhla; Kgalamono, Spo; Mathee, Angela; Naicker, Nisha",PLoS One,55,16

Objective: To determine if chilblains are associated with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This monocentric case series was conducted at the Department of Dermatology at Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, a tertiary care hospital in Brussels, Belgium, between April 10 and April 17, 2020. We evaluated a total of 31 referred patients who had recently developed chilblains. Main Outcomes and Measures: Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs for all patients and in skin biopsy specimens for 22 patients. Blood samples from all patients were tested for specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibodies. All patients had extended blood analyses. Histologic (22 patients) and immunofluorescence examinations (15 patients) were performed on the skin biopsy specimens. Results: The 31 patients were generally in good health; most were teenagers or young adults, and 19 were women. Histopathologic analysis of skin biopsy specimens (22 patients) confirmed the diagnosis of chilblains and showed occasional lymphocytic or microthrombotic phenomena. Immunofluorescence analyses showed vasculitis of small-diameter vessels in 7 patients. In all patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained undetected by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and in biopsy samples of the skin lesions. The IgM and IgG antibody titers were negative for SARS-CoV-2 in all patients (<1.0 arbitrary unit/mL). No significant abnormalities in blood test results were suggestive of systemic disease. Antinuclear antibody titers were low in 7 patients and higher in 1 patient. Conclusions and Relevance: Chilblains appeared not to be directly associated with COVID-19 in this case series.

In this study, we established a sensitive SCoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SP), including an SP mutant D614G, pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system and tested their ability to infect ACE2-expressing cells. Based on this system, we have demonstrated that an aqueous extract from the Natural herb Prunella vulgaris (NhPV) displayed potent inhibitory effects on SCoV-2 SP (including SPG614 mutant) pseudotyped virus (SCoV-2-SP-PVs) mediated infections. Moreover, we have compared NhPV with another compound, Suramin, for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities and the mode of their actions, and found that both NhPV and Suramin are able to directly interrupt SCoV-2-SP binding to its receptor ACE2 and block the viral entry step. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of NhPV and Suramin were confirmed by the wild type SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) virus infection in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results also demonstrated that the combination of NhPV/Suramin with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody mediated a more potent blocking effect against SCoV2-SP-PVs. Overall, by using SARS-CoV-2 SP-pseudotyped HIV-1-based entry system, we provide strong evidence that NhPV and Suramin have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may be developed as a novel antiviral approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ao, Zhujun; Chan, Mable; Ouyang, Maggie Jing; Olukitibi, Titus Abiola; Mahmoudi, Mona; Kobasa, Darwyn; Yao, Xiaojian",PLoS One,55,29

Developing a new kind of MUPC with portable cooling devices to improve medical workers' thermal comfort and protection performance of MUPC is imminent. In this paper, an integrated MUPC with a portable vortex tube cooling device was studied with experimental method. In a phytotron, a manikin wearing the MUPC was experimentally studied in terms of the influence of environment temperature and cool air supply conditions. On the basis of experiments, the MUPC inside air temperature and relative humidity, skin temperature of human body was studied with simulation method. Overall thermal sensation vote (TSV) and local TSV of human body were calculated, based on simulation results, to evaluate human thermal sensation. The results showed that, first, 50L/min cool air flowrate with 18â¼20â supply temperature can create a good MUPC inside thermal sensation environment, for both head supply and body supply conditions. Both body supply condition and head supply condition cannot create a uniform MUPC inside thermal sensation environment. Second, MUPC inside air relative humidity is around or lower than 60% for most body parts, except for air supply position and body parts that air is difficult to reach. Thirdly, with cool air supplied into MUPC, a micro-positive pressure environment can be obtained, and the protection performance of MUPC can be improved.","Su, Xing; Tian, Shaochen; Li, He; Zhang, Xu; Shao, Xiaolu; Gao, Jun; Ye, Hai",Energy Build,55,32

Based on the data obtained from the air quality monitoring station for the year 2019 and the first quarter of the year 2020, it was possible to develop an ANN model to simulate and predict the concentrations of three air pollutants, namely nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter with diameter less than 10 µm (PM10). Several ANN model configurations were tested to select the best model that could predict the concentration of the three air pollutants with meteorological parameters being used as input to the model. The results showed that the concentration of the pollutants during the coronavirus lockdown was declined by various percentages (from 29% for PM10 to 72% for NO2) as compared to their concentration before the pandemic period. Furthermore, the developed ANN model could simulate and predict the concentration of the pollutants during the pandemic period with sufficient accuracy as judged by the values of the coefficient of determination and the mean square error.

Thus, drugs that interfere in the spike protein/CD147 interaction or CD147 expression may inhibit viral invasion and dissemination among other cells, including in progenitor/stem cells. Studies suggest beneficial effects of azithromycin in reducing viral load of hospitalized patients, possibly interfering with ligand/CD147 receptor interactions; however, its possible effects on SARS-CoV-2 invasion has not yet been evaluated. In addition to the possible effect in invasion, azithromycin decreases the expression of some metalloproteinases (downstream to CD147), induces anti-viral responses in primary human bronchial epithelial infected with rhinovirus, decreasing viral replication and release. Moreover, resident lung progenitor/stem are extensively differentiated into myofibroblasts during pulmonary fibrosis, a complication observed in COVID-19 patients. This process, and the possible direct viral invasion of progenitor/stem cells via CD147 or ACE2, could result in the decline of these cellular stocks and failing lung repair.

However, despite recommendations and clinical evidence, SSCs are not widely used by general dentists, who favour extraction and more conventional restorations. The present study aimed to investigate the views of and use of SSCs among Norwegian and Finnish dentists. METHODS: The present study was a cross-sectional survey among Norwegian and Finnish dentists. An electronic questionnaire was sent to Norwegian and Finnish dentists asking whether they used SSCs and on which indications. In addition, the questionnaire assessed reasons for non-use and dentists' perceptions regarding advantages and challenges in the use of SSCs, as well as the need for additional training. Distributions of background characteristics, use of and views on SSCs were calculated, and statistical significance of the associations between respondents' background and their answers were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 574 Norwegian and 765 Finnish respondents, only 12.0% and 12.9% reported to use SSCs, respectively. The most frequently reported barrier reported by those who did not use SSCs was lack of practical training. The most frequent challenge reported by those using SSCs was difficulties in crown adjustment followed by aesthetic issues, and the most frequently reported advantage was that SSCs maintain the function and occlusion. The majority of respondents reported a need for more information and practical training in the use of SSCs, with hands-on course as their most frequently preferred education type. CONCLUSION: Although the value of SSCs for restoring young molars is recognized by Norwegian and Finnish dentists, SSCs are rarely used by general dentists. The majority of the respondents reported lack of training and materials and was interested in receiving more information and education.","Uhlen, M M; Tseveenjav, B; Wuollet, E; Furuholm, J; Ansteinsson, V; Mulic, A; Valen, H",BMC Oral Health,55,25

Therefore, in this work nine metals and metalloids (Cu, Cd, Pb, Hg, Ni, Fe, Mn, Zn and As) and three nutrients (P, N and C) that seem to accumulate in marine sediments, were determined under the fish cages (zero distance) and about 50 and 100 m away from them, in three aquacultures in Greece. The analysis of these data is crucial due to the negative impact of the intensive aquaculture activities on fish population, human health and marine environment. This study investigated the environmental impact associated with aquaculture cages on marine sediments, using Supervised Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in parallel with Classification Trees (CTs). Optimised models were constructed in order to detect the significance of each variable, predict the origin of the sediment samples and successfully visualise their results. Three popular ANN architectures, as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), radial basis function (RBF) and counter propagation artificial neural networks (CP-ANNs) were used to assess the impact of the intensive aquaculture activities on marine sediments. In addition, more traditional multivariate chemometric techniques like CTs were applied to the same data set for comparison purposes. The modelling study showed that P, N, Cu, Cd were the most critical (and polluting) factors of those metals studied. Moreover, single-element models achieved elevated predictive percentages. The results were justified due to the usual practices used for fish feeding or cages maintenance.","Farmaki, Eleni G; Thomaidis, Nikolaos S; Pasias, Ioannis N; Rousis, Nikolaos I; Baulard, Cecile; Papaharisis, Leonidas; Efstathiou, Constantinos E",Sci Total Environ,55,5

Runs of three consecutive liquid chromatography injections (about 300 µg of racemate repeatedly injected in a 100 µL loop) produced groups of peaks without band contamination (&#945;â¯=â¯1.2 and RSâ¯=â¯2.57). With this procedure approximately 3.0â¯mg of each enantiomer, with enantiomeric excess &#8805; 97% were obtained. Very profitably, the high volatility of n-hexane used as the sole eluent facilitated the solvent evaporation after the enantiomer recovery. High resolution mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the chemical identity of the two enantiomers was preserved along the entire process. The ability of Whelk-O1 phases in enantioseparating structurally similar compounds was confirmed with the analysis of other two racemates. Moreover, the relevant chemoselectivity exhibited by the CSP towards the three racemates should allow to simultaneously optimizing the enantioselectivity of different analytes and perform small-scale enantioresolutions of different compounds during the same run. In this study, the integration of experimental off-line electronic circular dichroism analysis with ab initio time-dependent density-functional theory simulations facilitated the assignment of the absolute configuration of the single enantiomers, while a molecular dynamics protocol can be useful to make a priori predictions of the enantioseparation ability of CSP towards selected compounds.","Ianni, Federica; Cerra, Bruno; Shandiz, Shiva Tali; Michele, Alessandro Di; Saluti, Giorgio; Galarini, Roberta; Gioiello, Antimo; Sardella, Roccaldo; Carotti, Andrea",J Chromatogr A,55,22

For the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis the international criteria ECMM/ISHAM 2020 were used. We analyzed the scientific literature data on the diagnosis and treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients with COVID-19. Results. Among the 12 examined patients with a severe course of COVID-19, invasive aspergillosis was diagnosed in 5 patients. Four patients (80%) were treated in the ICU. Steroids or interleukin-6 inhibitors were used in 80% patients. Severe lymphocytopenia was in 80% patients, neutropenia – 20%. A fever refractory to antibiotic therapy was noted in 80% patients, an increase in respiratory failure – 60%, acute respiratory distress syndrome – 60%. All patients showed negative dynamics of changes in the chest CT scan. Invasive aspergillosis was confirmed with a positive test for galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage and / or serum in 100% of cases. All patients received antifungal therapy with voriconazole and/or caspofungin. The overall 12-week survival rate was 80%. Conclusion. In ICU patients with severe COVID-19 and progressive pulmonary symptoms invasive aspergillosis should be excluded. Examination of substrates from the lower respiratory tract (BAL, tracheal aspirate, or nonbronchoscopic lavage) is necessary. Laboratory examination should include microscopy, culture and test for galactomannan.

While bats are considered a reservoir of deadly viruses, little is known about people's knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of bat conservation and ecology. The current study aimed to assess community people's knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of bat ecology, myths, and the role of bats in transmitting NiV in Bangladesh. Since 2001, NiV has been a continuous threat to public health with a mortality rate of approximately 70% in Bangladesh. Over the years, many public health interventions have been implemented to raise awareness about bats and the spreading of NiV among the community peoples of Nipah outbreak areas (NOAs) and Nipah non-outbreak areas (NNOAs). We hypothesized that people from both areas might have similar knowledge of bat ecology and myths about bats but different knowledge regarding their role in the spreading of NiV. Using a four-point Likert scale-based questionnaire, our analysis showed that most people lack adequate knowledge regarding the role of bats in maintaining the ecological balance and instead trust their beliefs in different myths about bats. Factor score analysis showed that respondents' gender (p = 0.01), the outbreak status of the area (p = 0.03), and their occupation (p = 0.04) were significant factors influencing their knowledge of bat ecology and myths. A regression analysis showed that farmers had 0.34 times the odds of having correct or positive knowledge of bat ecology and myths than businesspersons (odds ratio (OR) = 0.34, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.15-0.78, p = 0.01). Regarding the spreading of NiV via bats, people had a lower level of knowledge. In NOAs, age (p = 0.00), occupation (p = 0.00), and level of education (p = 0.00) were found to be factors contributing to the amount of knowledge regarding the transmission of NiV, whereas in NNOAs, the contributing factors were occupation (p = 0.00) and level of education (p = 0.01). Regression analysis revealed that respondents who were engaged in services (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.07-8.54, p = 0.04) and who had completed primary education (OR = 3.06, 95% CI = 1.02-9.17, p < 0.05) were likely to have correct knowledge regarding the spreading of NiV. Based on the study results, we recommend educational interventions for targeted groups in the community, highlighting the ecosystem services and conservation of bats so as to improve people's current knowledge and subsequent behavior regarding the role of bats in ecology and the spreading of NiV in Bangladesh.","Hassan, Mohammad Mahmudul; Kalam, Md Abul; Alam, Mahabub; Shano, Shahanaj; Faruq, Abdullah Al; Hossain, Md Saddam; Islam, Md Nurul; Khan, Shahneaz Ali; Islam, Ariful",,55,16

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has become a major global public health event. Nursing staff have played an important role in COVID-19 prevention and control. Understanding their emergency competencies for handling COVID-19, and the potential disadvantages will help governments to develop targeted training policies and improve nurses' capacities in relation to pandemics and emergency preparedness. INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a disastrous infectious disease, but the competencies of nurses in China to handle COVID-19 have not been well documented. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey on nurses from 22 provinces of China in February 2020. The scores of self-report questionnaires were used to analyse their competencies for core emergency care, and linear regression analysis was used to explore influential factors. RESULTS: A total of 2570 nurses participated. The study revealed that nurses had a good grasp of COVID-19 knowledge, but the majority of nurses lacked experience in isolation ward work and emergency training. We found that age, professional title, work department, major work content, total work time, disaster rescue history, emergency training and infectious disease training were associated with core emergency competencies. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese nurses were qualified for handling COVID-19 but still need to strengthen the accumulation of practical experience. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses should actively participate in emergencies to strengthen their operational capacity, whether in training or actual practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING/HEALTH POLICY: Managers should improve relevant policies to ensure that nurses have more opportunities to participate in the practical training of health emergencies and explore effective training methods to improve the ability of nurses to respond to these.","Li, Hongdan; Dong, Shuju; He, Li; Wang, Rui; Long, Shiyan; He, Fengming; Tang, Huairong; Feng, Ling",Int. nurs. rev,55,6

Although initial polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was attempted within the community, testing was soon abandoned due to an inability to keep up with demand by local laboratories. It is therefore feasible that undiagnosed transmission of COVID-19 in the community by asymptomatic individuals was a real possibility. Therefore, retrospective SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing of archived sera from out-patients visiting University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust service was performed to investigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. A total of 1779 sera samples were tested from samples collected between 16th March and 3rd June 2020, of which 202 (11.35%) were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Positivity was lowest in March (2.54%) at the beginning of the pandemic before peaking in April (17.16%) before a decline in May and June (11.16% and 12.68%, respectively). This retrospective screening offers some insight into the early patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within a sampled community population during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic; supporting the argument for more community screening during high incidences of pandemics.","Bird, Paul William; Sandhu, Kyran; Fletcher, Oliver; Ames, Billy; Toovey, Oliver; Tang, Julian Wei-Tze",J. med. virol,55,33

Afterwards, for many years, the clinical application of serum LDH measurement has been limited to the evaluation of anemias and to as a rough prognostic tool for certain tumors. Content In the last few years, significant changes have happened. First, the test has been confirmed as a robust predictor of poor outcomes in many neoplastic conditions. Furthermore, in the Revised International Staging System adopted in the 2015 by the International Myeloma Working Group, LDH acts as determinant of disease biology in differentiating myeloma stages. Finally, in the last few months, LDH is definitively reborn given its proven significant contribution in defining the COVID-19 severity. Conclusions This increased clinical role calls for an improvement of LDH assay standardization through the implementation of traceability of results of clinical samples to the available reference measurement system.","Panteghini, Mauro",Clin Chem Lab Med,55,16

We aimed to evaluate epidemiological characteristics, needs of resources, outcomes, and global burden of the disease. Methods: Systematic review was performed searching PubMed from December 1, 2019, to March 25, 2020, for full-text observational studies that described epidemiological characteristics, following MOOSE protocol. Global data were collected from the JHU-Corona Virus Resource Center, WHO-COVID-2019 situation reports, KFF.org, and Worldometers.info until March 31, 2020. The prevalence percentages were calculated. The global data were plotted in excel to calculate case fatality rate (CFR), predicted CFR, COVID-19 specific mortality rate, and doubling time for cases and deaths. CFR was predicted using Pearson correlation, regression models, and coefficient of determination. Results: From 21 studies of 2747 patients, 8.4% of patients died, 20.4% recovered, 15.4% were admitted to ICU and 14.9% required ventilation. COVID-19 was more prevalent in patients with hypertension (19.3%), smoking (11.3%), diabetes mellitus (10%), and cardiovascular diseases (7.4%). Common complications were pneumonia (82%), cardiac complications (26.4%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (15.7%), secondary infection (11.2%), and septic shock (4.3%). Though CFR and COVID-19 specific death rates are dynamic, they were consistently high for Italy, Spain, and Iran. Polynomial growth models were best fit for all countries for predicting CFR. Though many interventions have been implemented, stern measures like nationwide lockdown and school closure occurred after very high infection rates (>10cases per 100 000population) prevailed. Given the trend of government measures and decline of new cases in China and South Korea, most countries will reach the peak between April 1-20, if interventions are followed. Conclusions: A collective approach undertaken by a responsible government, wise strategy implementation and a receptive population may help contain the spread of COVID-19 outbreak. Close monitoring of predictive models of such indicators in the highly affected countries would help to evaluate the potential fatality if the second wave of pandemic occurs. The future studies should be focused on identifying accurate indicators to mitigate the effect of underestimation or overestimation of COVID-19 burden.","Patel, Urvish; Malik, Preeti; Mehta, Deep; Shah, Dhaivat; Kelkar, Raveena; Pinto, Candida; Suprun, Maria; Dhamoon, Mandip; Hennig, Nils; Sacks, Henry",J Glob Health,55,26

Monte Carlo calculations were performed to gauge the ability to deliver low-dose radiation to the thoracic mid-plane using an orthovoltage machine. In addition, the potential harm of a single dose of 0.75 Gy (whole-lung irradiation) was assessed based on the recommendations of the BEIR-VII committee of the U.S. National Research Council. Based on the results of this work, it was determined that an orthovoltage machine (minimum 300 kVp) can be used to deliver 0.75 Gy dose to the lungs while respecting cutaneous tolerance. Using data from the BEIR-VII Committee, it is evident that the apparent benefits of such radiation treatment for patients suffering from severe manifestations of the COVID-19 infectious syndrome outweigh the potential loss of life due to radiation-induced malignancy. Although the vaccination against COVID-19 has become a reality, the spread and mortality in severely ill patients remain unacceptably high. The risk of outbreaks in the future is unknown.

Materials and Methods: A total of 25 Candida spp. isolated from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, who were suspected to have pulmonary candidiasis, and 26 archived Candida spp. specimens were enrolled in this study. For the identification of Candida spp., PCR was performed to detect and amplify the ITS1 and ITS4 genes. Then the products were subjected to the Msp I restriction enzyme to precisely identify the species. The amplification of the WHP1 gene was conducted to identify Candida albicans species. The antifungal activities of routine drugs and the synthesize AuNPs against Candida spp. were assessed based on the protocols presented by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M60. Results: In the present study, C. albicans (24;96%) and C. parapsilosis (1;4%) were identified as the etiologic agents of the pulmonary candidiasis associated with the COVID-19 infection. Voriconazol and amphotericin B had superior activity against all the isolates in this study. Treatment with fluconazole and itraconazole did not significantly change the formation of colony-forming units (CFU). However, treatment with the AuNPs significantly decreased (within the range of 92-99.1%;P<0.05) the number of CFUs.

Although the main clinical manifestations are respiratory, an increase in neurological conditions, specifically acute cerebrovascular disease, has been detected. We present cerebrovascular disease case incidence in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were confirmed by microbiological/serological testing, or on chest CT semiology. Available data on co-morbidity, laboratory parameters, treatment administered, neuroimaging, neuropathological studies and clinical evolution during hospitalization, measured by the modified Rankin scale, were analysed. A bivariate study was also designed to identify differences between ischaemic and haemorrhagic subtypes. A statistical model of binary logistic regression and sensitivity analysis was designed to study the influence of independent variables over prognosis. In our centre, there were 1683 admissions of patients with COVID-19 over 50 days, of which 23 (1.4%) developed cerebrovascular disease. Within this group of patients, cerebral and chest CT scans were performed in all cases, and MRI in six (26.1%). Histological samples were obtained in 6/23 cases (two brain biopsies, and four arterial thrombi). Seventeen patients were classified as cerebral ischaemia (73.9%, with two arterial dissections), five as intracerebral haemorrhage (21.7%), and one leukoencephalopathy of posterior reversible encephalopathy type. Haemorrhagic patients had higher ferritin levels at the time of stroke (1554.3 versus 519.2, P = 0.004). Ischaemic strokes were unexpectedly frequent in the vertebrobasilar territory (6/17, 35.3%). In the haemorrhagic group, a characteristic radiological pattern was identified showing subarachnoid haemorrhage, parieto-occipital leukoencephalopathy, microbleeds and single or multiple focal haematomas. Brain biopsies performed showed signs of thrombotic microangiopathy and endothelial injury, with no evidence of vasculitis or necrotizing encephalitis. The functional prognosis during the hospital period was unfavourable in 73.9% (17/23 modified Rankin scale 4-6), and age was the main predictive variable (odds ratio = 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.012-2.225; P = 0.043).

One of the remarkable threats associated with mortality may be the uncontrolled inflammatory processes, which were induced by SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients. As there are no specific drugs, exploiting safe and effective treatment strategies is an instant requirement to dwindle viral damage and relieve extreme inflammation simultaneously. Here, highly biocompatible glycyrrhizic acid (GA) nanoparticles (GANPs) were synthesized based on GA. In vitro investigations revealed that GANPs inhibit the proliferation of the murine coronavirus MHV-A59 and reduce proinflammatory cytokine production caused by MHV-A59 or the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. In an MHV-A59-induced surrogate mouse model of COVID-19, GANPs specifically target areas with severe inflammation, such as the lungs, which appeared to improve the accumulation of GANPs and enhance the effectiveness of the treatment. Further, GANPs also exert antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects, relieving organ damage and conferring a significant survival advantage to infected mice. Such a novel therapeutic agent can be readily manufactured into feasible treatment for COVID-19.","Zhao, Zhaoyan; Xiao, Yuchen; Xu, Lingqing; Liu, Ye; Jiang, Guanmin; Wang, Wei; Li, Bin; Zhu, Tianchuan; Tan, Qingqin; Tang, Lantian; Zhou, Haibo; Huang, Xi; Shan, Hong",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,55,2

The study is aimed at exploring the clinical significance of INHBB in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) by bioinformatics analysis. Methods: Real-time PCR and analyses of Oncomine, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases were utilized to evaluate the INHBB gene transcription level of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue. We evaluated the INHBB methylation level and the relationship between expression and methylation levels of CpG islands in CRC tissue. The corresponding clinical data were obtained to further explore the association of INHBB with clinical and survival features. In addition, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore the gene ontology and signaling pathways of INHBB involved. Results: INHBB expression was elevated in CRC tissue. Although the promoter of INHBB was hypermethylated in CRC, methylation did not ultimately correlate with the expression of INHBB. Overexpression of INHBB was significantly and positively associated with invasion depth, distant metastasis, and TNM stage. Cox regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that high expression of INHBB was correlated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). GSEA showed that INHBB was closely correlated with 5 cancer-promoting signaling pathways including the Hedgehog signaling pathway, ECM receptor interaction, TGF-ß signaling pathway, focal adhesion, and pathway in cancer. INHBB expression significantly promoted macrophage infiltration and inhibited memory T cell, mast cell, and dendritic cell infiltration. INHBB expression was positively correlated with stromal and immune scores of CRC samples. Conclusion: INHBB might be a potential prognostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target for CRC.","Yuan, Jinpeng; Xie, Aosi; Cao, Qiangjian; Li, Xinxin; Chen, Juntian",Biomed Res Int,55,16

A subset of these patients developed refractory hypoxaemia despite maximal conventional mechanical ventilation and required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This review focuses on considerations for ventilatory strategies, infection control and patient selection related to ECMO for ARDS in a pandemic. We also summarise the experiences with ECMO in previous respiratory pandemics. METHODS: A review of pertinent studies was conducted via a search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar. References of articles were also examined to identify other relevant publications. RESULTS: Since the H1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009, the use of ECMO for ARDS continues to grow despite limitations in evidence for survival benefit. There is emerging evidence to suggest that lung protective ventilation for ARDS can be further optimised while receiving ECMO so as to minimise ventilator-induced lung injury and subsequent contributions to multi-organ failure. Efforts to improve outcomes should also encompass appropriate infection control measures to reduce co-infections and prevent nosocomial transmission of novel respiratory viruses. Patient selection for ECMO in a pandemic can be challenging. We discuss important ethical considerations and predictive scoring systems that may assist clinical decision-making to optimise resource allocation. CONCLUSION: The role of ECMO in managing ARDS during respiratory pandemics continues to grow. This is supported by efforts to redefine optimal ventilatory strategies, reinforce infection control measures and enhance patient selection.","Lim, Joel Kian Boon; Qadri, Syeda Kashfi; Toh, Theresa Shu Wen; Lin, Cheryl Bin; Mok, Yee Hui; Lee, Jan Hau",Ann Acad Med Singapore,55,1

AIM: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of showing Year 1 medical students authentic recorded consultations between GPs and patients, and then explore what they gained from this. METHOD: Using Panopto® Video Platform, we pre-recorded real Primary Care consultations, with patient and GP consent, which were then processed securely using the University of Aberdeen server. These were shown to all Year 1 medical students who immediately debriefed these consultations in small groups with a GP tutor. Subsequently two focus groups were held with 11 students to evaluate what they had learnt. LEARNING OUTCOMES: The consultations were easy to record and play during the teaching session, although there were some issues with sound quality. All students in the focus groups enjoyed the experience. They gained new knowledge about the skills of GPs, and recognised GPs as positive role models. Students were able to identify a variety of communication and consultation skills used by the GP, which reinforced their teaching on these delivered elsewhere in the course. CONCLUSION: Using pre-recorded consultations as a teaching tool is reproducible, time-efficient and beneficial to students. We propose that this model of using authentic 'live' interactions between GPs and patients represents a valuable undergraduate educational opportunity and could be utilised by medical schools internationally.","Dow, Naomi; Wass, Val; Macleod, David; Muirhead, Laura; McKeown, John",Educ Prim Care,55,16

The segmentation of infected areas from computed tomography (CT) images can be used to assist and provide useful information for COVID-19 diagnosis. Although several deep learning-based segmentation methods have been proposed for COVID-19 segmentation and have achieved state-of-the-art results, the segmentation accuracy is still not high enough (approximately 85%) due to the variations COVID-19 infected areas (such as shape and size variations) and the similarities between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infected areas. To improve the segmentation accuracy of COVID-19 infected areas, we propose an interactive attention refinement network (Attention RefNet). This network is integrated with a backbone segmentation network to refine the initial segmentation resulting from the backbone segmentation network. There are three contributions of this paper, as follows. First, we propose an interactive attention refinement network, which can be connected with any segmentation network and trained with the segmentation network in an end-to-end fashion. Second, we propose a skip connection attention module to improve the important features in both segmentation and refinement networks for initial segmentation and refinement. Ultimately, we propose a seed point module to enhance the important seeds (positions) for interactive refinement. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated on public datasets (COVID-19CTSeg and MICCAI) and our private multicenter dataset. The segmentation accuracy was improved to more than 90%. We also confirmed the generalizability of the proposed network on our multicenter dataset. The proposed method can still achieve high segmentation accuracy. The model can even be applied to datasets from other centers that are collected in different hospitals and were not included in the training dataset.","Kitrungrotsakul, Titinunt; Chen, Qingqing; Wu, Huitao; Iwamoto, Yutaro; Hu, Honjie; Zhu, Wenchao; Chen, Chao; Xu, Fangyi; Zhou, Yong; Lin, Lanfen; Tong, Ruo-Feng; Li, Jingsong; Chen, Yen Wei",IEEE j. biomed. health inform.

South Africa implemented a strict lockdown in March 2020 before its first COVID-19 wave started, gradually lifted restrictions between May and September 2020, and then re-imposed restrictions in December 2020 in response to its second wave. There is concern that COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality, fear of transmission, and government responses may have led to a reduction in antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiations for HIV-infected individuals in countries like South Africa. MethodsWe analyzed national, public sector, facility-level data from South Africas District Health Information System (DHIS) from January 2019 to March 2021 to quantify changes in ART initiation rates stratified by province, setting, facility size and type and compared the timing of these changes to COVID-19 case numbers and government lockdown levels. We excluded facilities with missing data, mobile clinics, and correctional facilities. We estimated the total number of ART initiations per study month for each stratum and compared monthly totals, by year. ResultsAt the 2471 facilities in the final data set (59% of all ART sites in the DHIS), 28% fewer initiations occurred in 2020 than in 2019. Numbers of ART initiations declined sharply in all provinces in April-June 2020, compared to the same months in 2019, and remained low for the rest of 2020, with some recovery between COVID-19 waves in October 2020 and possible improvement beginning in March 2021. Percentage reductions were largest in district hospitals, larger facilities, and urban areas. After the initial decline in April-June 2020, most provinces experienced a clear inverse relationship between COVID-19 cases and ART initiations but little relationship between ART initiations and lockdown level. ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it resulted in substantial declines in the number of HIV-infected individuals starting treatment in South Africa, with no recovery of numbers during 2020. These delays may lead to worse treatment outcomes for those with HIV and potentially higher HIV transmission. Exceptional effort will be needed to sustain gains in combating HIV.","Benade, Mariet; Long, Lawrence; Rosen, Sydney; Meyer-Rath, Gesine; Tucker, Jeanne-Marie; Miot, Jacqui",,55,16

This is particularly evident in internal medicine where diagnostic boundaries are often blurred. Making a diagnosis is a multi-stage process which requires proper data collection, the formulation of an illness script and testing of the diagnostic hypothesis. To make sense of a number of variables, physicians may follow an analytical or an intuitive approach to clinical reasoning, depending on their personal experience and level of professionalism. Intuitive thinking is more typical of experienced physicians, but is not devoid of shortcomings. Particularly, the high risk of biases must be counteracted by de-biasing techniques, which require constant critical thinking.

Datasets of these genomes assembled from multiple hospitals can give critical clues to regional or national trends in infection. Herein, we report a lineage summary based on data collected from hospitals located in the Tokyo metropolitan area. We performed SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing of specimens from 198 patients with COVID-19 at 13 collaborating hospitals located in the Kanto region. Phylogenetic analysis and fingerprinting of the nucleotide substitutions were performed to differentiate and classify the viral lineages. More than 90% of the identified strains belonged to Clade 20B, which has been prevalent in European countries since March 2020. Only two lineages (B.1.1.284 and B.1.1.214) were found to be predominant in Japan. However, one sample from a COVID-19 patient admitted to a hospital in the Kanto region in November 2020 belonged to the B.1.346 lineage of Clade 20C, which has been prevalent in the western United States since November 2020. The patient had no history of overseas travel or any known contact with anyone who had travelled abroad. Consequently, the Clade 20C strain belonging to the B.1.346 lineage appeared likely to have been imported from the western United States to Japan across the strict quarantine barrier. B.1.1.284 and B.1.1.214 lineages were found to be predominant in the Kanto region, but a single case of the B.1.346 lineage of clade 20C, probably imported from the western United States, was also identified. These results illustrate that a decentralized network of hospitals offers significant advantages as a highly responsive system for monitoring regional molecular epidemiologic trends.","Abe, Kodai; Shimura, Takako; Takenouchi, Toshiki; Iwasaki, Yuka W; Ishizu, Hirotsugu; Uwamino, Yoshifumi; Uno, Shunsuke; Gotoh, Jun; Tachikawa, Natsuo; Takeuchi, Yuriko; Katayama, Junpei; Nozaki, Hiroyuki; Fujii, Susumu; Seki, Shikou; Nakamura, Morio; Uda, Kazuhiro; Misumi, Takahiko; Ishihara, Jun; Yamada, Kenichiro; Kanai, Toshio; Murai, Shinji; Araki, Kazuhiro; Ebihara, Tamotsu; Siomi, Haruhiko; Hasegawa, Naoki; Kitagawa, Yuko; Amagai, Masayuki; Suematsu, Makoto; Kosaki, Kenjiro",Keio J Med,55,16

In 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome occurred in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) of China. We aimed to evaluate competency in RID prevention procedures in terms of hospital performance and physician behavior. Patients and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 10 tertiary general public hospitals in 3 cities of IMAR. In each hospital, we chose the respiratory and ear–nose–throat outpatient departments (OPDs) and the emergency department (ED) to invite patients with symptoms of cough to join the study before they consulted a physician. After their consultation, we asked the patients to complete a checklist to score the performance of the departments and the behavior of their physicians in terms of RID prevention practices according to international professional guidelines. Results: From 711 respondents, in the domain of hospital performance, display of posters on directive to wash hands after coughing/sneezing had an average score of 0.452 (range 0–1), while other cough etiquette items had scores averaging between 0.33 and 0.39. The average score for air ventilation was 0.66. For physicians’ performance, informing patients the location of handwashing facilities scored the highest (0.62), while low scores were seen for offering a mask to coughing patients (0.14) and encouraging coughing patients to distance themselves from others (0.17). Most RID prevention procedures received low scores in EDs in both hospital performance and physician behavior domains. Conclusion: Hospitals in IMAR should improve their performance in RID prevention procedures, especially in giving information to RID patients through the display of posters. The practice of physicians in preventing respiratory infection spread was suboptimum. ED staff and hospital administrators should improve their procedures to prevent the spread of respiratory infections, especially given the increasing occurrences of global pandemics such as COVID-19.","Xie, Yijing; McNeil, Edward; Fan, Yancun; Chongsuvivatwong, Virasakdi; Zhao, Xingsheng; Sriplung, Hutcha",Risk Manage.

DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: Systematic review of 5 databases, and screening of eligible articles, from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We focused on quantitative and mixed-method studies that evaluated adolescent mental health literacy, appropriate package of services and provider competencies in mental health services, and that targeted depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder among adolescents (10-19 years). This included adolescents exposed to interventions or strategies within mental health services. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Study quality was assessed using the National Institutes for Health Study Quality Assessment Tools. Data were extracted and grouped based on WHO quality Standards. RESULTS: Of the 20 104 studies identified, 20 articles were included. The majority of studies came from high-income countries, with one from a low-income country. Most of the studies did not conceptualise quality. Results found that an online decision aid was evaluated to increase adolescent mental health literacy. Studies that targeted an appropriate package of services evaluated the quality of engagement between the therapist and adolescent, patient-centred communication, mental health service use, linkages to mental health services, health facility culture and intensive community treatment. Provider competencies focused on studies that evaluated confidence in managing and referring adolescents, collaboration between health facility levels, evidence-based practices and technology use. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: There is limited evidence on quality measures in adolescent mental health services (as conforms to the WHO Global Standards), pointing to a global evidence gap for adolescent mental health services. There are several challenges to overcome, including a need to develop consensus on quality and methods to measure quality in mental health settings.

The current research aims at the improvements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during the COVID-19 lockdown in India. This research has been done using both the open source data sets taken from satellite and ground based for better analysis. For the satellite-based analysis, the Sentinel 5 Precauser's Tropospheric NO2 from the European Space Agency and for the ground-based numeric data sets from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has been used. During the COVID-19 disease, outbreak the world has set in quarantine and as an overcome air quality improved in Asian countries after national lockdown, the average NO2 rates plummeted calculated by 40-50%. Similarly, it dramatically decreased in Asia during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine period. The basic statistical patterns of the NO2 concentration spectrum of historical data sets (2018-2020) bi-weekly showed during October to March were seen higher in each year. Related with National Ambient Air Quality Standards of mean of NO2 in India our result shown in the NO2 levels fall in 21 µg/m3 during the national lockdown, from the Central Pollution Control Board's air quality standards it almost decreased 50% of the hourly mean in India. This caused by the sudden restriction to the development of manufacturing and the transportations which ultimately minimized the fossil fuel burning which cause the most of the NO2 releases to the atmosphere.

Most patients present with an antecedent illness, most commonly upper respiratory tract infection, before the onset of progressive motor weakness. Several microorganisms have been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, most notably Campylobacter jejuni, Zika virus, and in 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In C jejuni-related Guillain-Barré syndrome, there is good evidence to support an autoantibody-mediated immune process that is triggered by molecular mimicry between structural components of peripheral nerves and the microorganism. Making a diagnosis of so-called classical Guillain-Barré syndrome is straightforward; however, the existing diagnostic criteria have limitations and can result in some variants of the syndrome being missed. Most patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome do well with immunotherapy, but a substantial proportion are left with disability, and death can occur. Results from the International Guillain-Barré Syndrome Outcome Study suggest that geographical variations exist in Guillain-Barré syndrome, including insufficient access to immunotherapy in low-income countries. There is a need to provide improved access to treatment for all patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, and to develop effective disease-modifying therapies that can limit the extent of nerve injury. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate some of the potential therapeutic candidates, including complement inhibitors, which, together with emerging data from large international collaborative studies on the syndrome, will contribute substantially to understanding the many facets of this disease.","Shahrizaila, Nortina; Lehmann, Helmar C; Kuwabara, Satoshi",Lancet,55,2

I aim to share my thoughts as an unsettled 4th year medical student about to embark on my first set of clinical exams conducted in this format. The difficulties associated with preparing for examinations under such unique and challenging circumstances cannot be underestimated. Working from home, during social distancing, surrounds students with the extra family stresses that we are all facing during this pandemic. This combined with a new, unfamiliar examination format will inevitably lead to students feeling daunted. While some would argue that an OBE may reward good problem solvers, students still require a strong foundation of knowledge. The luxury of reference will not be afforded in all clinical settings thus leading to concerns regarding students skimming over essential learning points. Furthermore, we cannot ignore the increased opportunity for academic misconduct resulting from an open book assessment format.

This research applies structural equation modeling (SEM) to achieve a detailed understanding of the issue. The findings reveal that Integrated Social Media Interaction (ISMI) depends on Customer-Centric Focus (CCF), Customer Engagement Focus (CEF), and Customer Empathy Focus (CEmF). Based on the literature and our analytical research, it is revealed that the use of social media networks as a source of knowledge for NPD ventures is a systematic component of the NPD process for SMEs during the COVOD-19 pandemic. To support their NPD initiatives, SMEs may depend on this hypothesized integrated model. The analysis concludes with SME managers' realistic and managerial guidance.

237541,237541,237541,The Resilience of Critical Infrastructure Systems: A Systematic Literature Review,14.852199,3.859128,2021,"Purpose: Healthcare governance places medical ethics at the forefront of defining and maintaining the quality of care. Examples of serious ethical issues include sexual abuse of patients (Dubois, Walsh, Chibnall et al., 2017), criminal prescription of opioids (Johnson, 2019) and unnecessary surgical procedures (Tayade and Dalvi, 2016) or shortages in service delivery because of little knowledge or experience especially during pandemic outbreaks (Hay-David et al., 2020). In many cases involving medical ethics, patients are identified as the first victims; however, this study aimed to consider clinicians and other healthcare practitioners as other probable victims (Ozeke et al., 2019). Design/methodology/approach: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that tens of millions of patients worldwide suffer disabling injuries or death every year due to unsafe medical practices and services. Nearly, one in ten patients is harmed due to preventable causes while receiving health care in well-funded and technologically advanced hospital settings (WHO, 2016). Much less is known about the burden of unsafe care in non-hospital settings, where most healthcare services are delivered (Jha et al., 2013). Furthermore, there is little evidence concerning the burden of unsafe care in developing countries, where the risk of harm to patients is likely to be greater, due to limitations in infrastructure, technologies and human resources (Elmontsri et al., 2018). Findings: While these problems are endemic in health care, they are exacerbated in times of health and social crises such as the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This pandemic has few precedents, being most closely paralleled with the global influenza pandemic of 1918 (Terry, 2020). Initially compared to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002–2003 (Parrym, 2003), COVID-19 is already proving much more deadly. The WHO’s estimates of the number of SARS cases from the start of the outbreak in 2002, until it was brought under control in July 2003, was 8,437 cumulative cases, with 813 deaths (WHO, 2003). The European Center for disease prevention and Control estimated that as of May 15, 2020, that 4,405,680 cases of COVID-19 have been reported with 302,115 deaths (ECDC, 2020) Research limitations/implications: The outbreak of COVID-19 was declared in February 2020 in the Islamic Republic of Iran, and up to March 2020, the cases of morbidity reached 12,729, with 611 deaths (Bedasht, 2020). The current figure at the time of editing (May 16, 2020) is 118,392 cases, with 6,937 deaths (Worldometer, 2020). Acting in cognizance of its ethical responsibility to the citizens of Iran, the Iranian government has taken the following action to attempt to mitigate the deleterious effects of the virus: in each province, one or more hospitals have been evacuated and allocated to patients with pulmonary problems with suspected to COVID-19. Access to intensive care units and specialist equipment is a primary ethical issue that concerns the Iranian healthcare system. The issue is exacerbated by the knowledge that these facilities are not distributed equitably in the country. Therefore, equity is the first ethical concern in this situation. Practical implications: All nurses, clinicians, practitioners and specialists have been asked to volunteer their services in hospitals in the most infected areas. This raises ethical concerns about access to personal protective equipment (PPE) such as appropriate masks, gowns, gloves and other equipment to protect healthcare workers from infection. Access to PPE was restricted because of government failure to stockpile the necessary amount of disposable medical equipment. This was related to lack of domestic capacity to produce the equipment and problems accessing it internationally due to political-economic sanctions that were imposed on Iran by the USA and some European countries. Such shortages can quickly lead to a catastrophic situation; current evidence demonstrates that about 40% of healthcare workers are vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection (Behdasht, 2020). However, it should be noted that this is not a problem limited to Iran. As of March 2020, the WHO was already warning about PPE shortages and the dangers this posed for healthcare workers around the world (WHO, 2020). Social implications: A Disaster Committee was created by the Iranian Ministry of Health to take responsibility for decision-making and daily information sharing to the community. The ethical dilemma that arises in terms of reporting the situation is the conflict between transparently presenting accurate and timely information and the creation of public panic and fear that this may cause in the community. Originality/value: As a steward for public health, the Ministry of Health was afforded direct responsibility to maintain intra-sector relationships and leadership with other organizations such as political executive organizations, municipalities, military agencies, schools, universities and other public organizations to reach consensus on the best methods of controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. An important ethical issue is found in potential areas of conflict between the therapeutic and preventive roles of the Ministry of Health and those related to public health and the civil administrations.","Bastani, Peivand; Sheykhotayefeh, Mostafa; Tahernezhad, Ali; Hakimzadeh, Seyyed Mostafa; Rikhtegaran, Samaneh",Int.

Sex disparities in genetics, immunological responses, and hormonal mechanisms may underlie the substantially higher fatality rates reported in male COVID-19 patients. To optimise care for COVID-19 patients, prophylactic and therapeutic studies should include sex-specific design and analyses. Therefore, in this scoping review, we investigated whether studies on pharmacological treatment in COVID-19 were performed based on a priori sex-specific design or post-hoc sex-specific analyses. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, UpToDate, clinical trial.org, and MedRxiv for studies on pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 until June 6th, 2020. We included case series, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies in humans (&#8805;18 years) investigating antiviral, antimalarial, and immune system modulating drugs. Data were collected on 1) the proportion of included females, 2) whether sex stratification was performed (a priori by design or post-hoc), and 3) whether effect modification by sex was investigated. Findings: 30 studies were eligible for inclusion, investigating remdesivir (n = 2), lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 5), favipiravir (n = 1), umifenovir (n = 1), hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (n = 8), convalescent plasma (n = 6), interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway inhibitors (n = 5), interleukin-1 (IL-1) pathway inhibitors (n = 1) and corticosteroids (n = 3). Only one study stratified its data based on sex in a post-hoc analysis, whereas none did a priori by design. None of the studies investigated effect modification by sex. A quarter of the studies included twice as many males as females. Interpretation: Analyses assessing potential interference of sex with (side-)effects of pharmacological therapy for COVID-19 are rarely reported. Considering sex differences in case-fatality rates and genetic, immunological, and hormonal mechanisms, studies should include sex-specific analyses in their design to optimise COVID-19 care.

Each viral genome is accompanied by a set of metadata which supplies important information such as the geographic origin of the sample, age of the host, and the lab at which the sample was sequenced, and is integral to epidemiological efforts and public health direction. Here, we interrogate some shortcomings of metadata within the GISAID database to raise awareness of common errors and inconsistencies that may affect data-driven analyses and provide possible avenues for resolutions. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals a startling prevalence of spelling errors and inconsistent naming conventions, which together occur in an estimated ~ 9.8% and ~ 11.6% of ""originating lab"" and ""submitting lab"" GISAID metadata entries respectively. We also find numerous ambiguous entries which provide very little information about the actual source of a sample and could easily associate with multiple sources worldwide. Importantly, all of these issues can impair the ability and accuracy of association studies by deceptively causing a group of samples to identify with multiple sources when they truly all identify with one source, or vice versa.","Gozashti, Landen; Corbett-Detig, Russell",BMC Res Notes,55,1

The purpose of this study was to understand pediatric nurses' experiences during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, when they were caring for patients outside of their usual practice. DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was implemented, and a descriptive survey was sent to all pediatric nurses who worked during the peak of the pandemic, from March 2020 - May 2020. Categorical responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and free texts were coded to develop central themes. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the data: concerns for safety, unprepared to care, nurses' emotional responses, and persevering together. CONCLUSIONS: As pediatric nurses adjusted to caring for a new disease and a new population of patients, concerns of safety and preparedness emanated. The need for teamwork and support was emphasized by nurses. The impact that nurses' experiences had on their emotional wellbeing was also highlighted. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Exploring pediatric nurses' experiences during a pandemic is important, as it furthers understanding and guides efforts to enhance preparedness for a future pandemic or public health emergency.

Based on a recent consensus statement supported by international medical mycology societies, it has been proposed to define CAPA as possible, probable, or proven on the basis of sample validity and thus diagnostic certainty. Considering current challenges associated with proven diagnoses, there is pressing need to study the epidemiology of proven CAPA. METHODS: We report the incidence of histologically diagnosed CAPA in a series of 45 consecutive COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed autopsies, performed at Padova University Hospital during the first and second wave of the pandemic. Clinical data, laboratory data and radiological features were also collected for each case. RESULTS: Proven CAPA was detected in 9 (20%) cases, mainly in the second wave of the pandemic (7/17 vs. 2/28 of the first wave). The population of CAPA patients consisted of seven males and two females, with a median age of 74 years. Seven patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. All patients had at least two comorbidities, and concomitant lung diseases were detected in three cases.

The clinical presentation of severe patients resembles viral-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, a rare condition previously seen during lethal influenza pandemics and during previous SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers an over-exuberant inflammatory response due to the development of a cytokine storm and the depletion of the adaptative immune compartment, which may prelude sepsis in many cases.

Treatment strategies incorporating the blockade of migration and differentiation of monocyte-macrophage, such as granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor inhibitors, might enhance the promising results seen so far with selective cytokine blockade.","Gómez-Rial, Jose; Rivero-Calle, Irene; Salas, Antonio; Martinón-Torres, Federico",Infect Drug Resist,55,1

Several mechanisms regulate the cellular response to oxygen including the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)/factor inhibiting HIF (FIH)-hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway, cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol) dioxygenase (ADO) system, and the lysine-specific demethylases (KDM) 5A and KDM6A. Using a systems-based approach we discuss the literature on oxygen sensing pathways in the context of virus replication in different tissues that experience variable oxygen tension. Current information supports a model where the PHD-HIF pathway enhances the replication of viruses infecting tissues under low oxygen, however, the reverse is true for viruses with a selective tropism for higher oxygen environments. Differences in oxygen tension and associated HIF signaling may play an important role in viral tropism and pathogenesis. Thus, pharmaceutical agents that modulate HIF activity could provide novel treatment options for viral infections and associated pathological conditions.","Liu, Peter Jianrui; Balfe, Peter; McKeating, Jane A; Schilling, Mirjam",Viruses,55,20

Viral blockade of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 impedes degradation of the active kinin des-Arg(9)-bradykinin, which thus increasingly activates bradykinin receptors known to promote inflammation, cough, and edema-symptoms that are commonly observed in COVID-19. However, lean and reliable investigation of the postulated alterations is currently hindered by non-specific peptide adsorption, lacking sensitivity, and cross-reactivity of applicable assays. Here, an LC-MS/MS method was established to determine the following kinins in respiratory lavage fluids: kallidin, bradykinin, des-Arg(10)-kallidin, des-Arg(9)-bradykinin, bradykinin 1-7, bradykinin 2-9 and bradykinin 1-5. This method was fully validated according to regulatory bioanalytical guidelines of the European Medicine Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration and has a broad calibration curve range (up to a factor of 103), encompassing low quantification limits of 4.4-22.8 pg/mL (depending on the individual kinin). The application of the developed LC-MS/MS method to nasal lavage fluid allowed for the rapid (~ 2 h), comprehensive and low-volume (100 µL) determination of kinins. Hence, this novel assay may support current efforts to investigate the pathophysiology of COVID-19, but can also be extended to other diseases.","Gangnus, Tanja; Burckhardt, Bjoern B",Sci Rep,55,26

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: With rapid expansion and uptake of telemedicine during the pandemic, many have posited that virtual visits will endure even as in-person visits are reinstated. The public's perception of telemedicine for an initial surgical consultation has not been previously studied. METHODS: A 43-question survey assessed respondents' attitudes toward telemedicine for initial consultations with surgeons, both in the context of COVID-19 and during ""normal circumstances."" Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowd-sourcing marketplace. RESULTS: Based on 1827 analyzable responses, we found that a majority (86%) of respondents reported being satisfied (either extremely or somewhat) with telemedicine encounters. Interestingly, preference for in-person versus virtual surgical consultation reflected access to care, with preference for telemedicine decreasing from 72% to 33% when COVID-related social distancing ends. Preferences for virtual visits decreased with increasing complexity of the surgical intervention, even during the pandemic. A majority felt that ""establishing trust and comfort"" was best accomplished in person, and the vast majority felt it was important to meet their surgeons prior to the day of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The public views telemedicine as an acceptable substitute for in-person visits, especially during the pandemic. However, it appears that an in-person interaction is still preferred when possible for surgical consultations. If telemedicine services are to persist beyond social distancing, further exploration of its impact on the patient-surgeon relationship will be needed.","Sorensen, Meredith J; Bessen, Sarah; Danford, Julia; Fleischer, Christina; Wong, Sandra L",Ann. surg,55,13

Various degrees of pulmonary fibrosis can be associated with this inflammatory condition. Interstitial lung disease related to oncological drugs is a relevant problem in clinical practice. The etiopathogenetic mechanisms underlying this adverse event are not completely known but can be partly explained by the mechanism of action of the drug involved. Therefore, knowledge of the relevance of this potentially fatal adverse event supported by the reported safety data of pivotal studies becomes fundamental in the management of patients. The prompt diagnosis of drug-related pneumonia and the consequent differential diagnosis with other forms of pneumonia allow a rapid suspension of treatment and the establishment of an immunosuppressive treatment if necessary. In the context of the health emergency related to SARS CoV2 infection and COVID-19-related interstitial lung disease, such knowledge holds decisive relevance in the conscious choice of cancer treatments. Our intent was to describe the oncological drugs most correlated with this adverse event by reporting, where possible, the percentages of insurgency in pivotal studies to provide an overview and therefore promote greater awareness of this important toxicity related to oncological treatment.","Cherri, Sara; Noventa, Silvia; Fanelli, Martina; Calandra, Giulio; Prochilo, Tiziana; Bnà, Claudio; Savelli, Giordano; Zaniboni, Alberto",,55,9

Often debilitating, these sequelae are clinically heterogeneous and of unknown molecular etiology. Here, a transcriptome-wide investigation of this new condition was performed in a large cohort of acutely infected patients followed clinically into the post-acute period. Gene expression signatures of post-acute sequelae were already present in whole blood during the acute phase of infection, with both innate and adaptive immune cells involved. Plasma cells stood out as driving at least two distinct clusters of sequelae, one largely dependent on circulating antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the other antibody-independent. Altogether, multiple etiologies of post-acute sequelae were found concomitant with SARS-CoV-2 infection, directly linking the emergence of these sequelae with the host response to the virus.","Thompson, Ryan Conrad; Simons, Nicole W.; Wilkins, Lillian; Cheng, Esther; Del-Valle, Diane Marie; Hoffman, Gabriel E.; Fennessy, Brian; Mouskas, Konstantinos; Francoeur, Nancy J.; Johnson, Jessica S.; Lepow, Lauren; Berichel, Jessica Le; Chang, Christie; Beckmann, Aviva G.; Wang, Ying-chih; Nie, Kai; Zaki, Nicholas; Tuballes, Kevin; Barcessat, Vanessa; Cedillo, Mario A.; Huckins, Laura; Roussos, Panagiotis; Marron, Thomas U.; Team, - The Mount Sinai COVID-19 Biobank; Glicksberg, Benjamin S.; Nadkarni, Girish; Gonzalez-Kozlova, Edgar; Kim-Schulze, Seunghee; Sebra, Robert; Merad, Miriam; Gnjatic, Sacha; Schadt, Eric E.; Charney, Alexander W.; Beckmann, Noam D.",,55,24

In this study, we estimate this undetected fraction of the population by a modeling and simulation approach. We employ an epidemic model SIPHERD in which three categories of infection carriers, symptomatic, purely asymptomatic, and exposed are considered with different transmission rates that are taken dependent on the social distancing conditions, and the detection rate of the infected carriers is taken dependent on the tests done per day. The model is first validated for Germany and South Korea and then applied for prediction of the total number of confirmed, active and dead, and daily new positive cases in the United States. Our study predicts the possible outcomes of the infection if social distancing conditions are relaxed or kept stringent. We estimate that around 30.1 million people are already infected, and in the absence of any vaccine, 66.2 million (range: 64.3-68.0) people, or 20% (range: 19.4-20.5) of the population will be infected by mid-February 21 if social distancing conditions are not made stringent.

Using these big ideas, constraints were derived for online LS and a pilot online LS was performed. Data were collected on the process and team members' reflections. The experience in the pilot was mapped against the outcomes of the theoretical analysis.FindingsSetting up close collaboration and the observation of the online lesson appeared to be the most challenging issues. A set of recommendations in the form of do's and don'ts was derived from the experience.Practical implicationsThe set of recommendations can be applied by practitioners who face the challenge of performing LS in an online environment, and can serve as a start for further research in online LS.Originality/valueThe original contribution of the article is the combination of the theoretical analysis of LS combined with the practical experience in the pilot.

The grounded theory approach was applied, which is one of the qualitative designs. The content of the verses of the Noble Qur'an and the hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad that dealt with the issue of crises were analyzed. The results of the qualitative analysis of the verses of the Qur'an and the hadiths of the Prophet's noble Sunnah have resulted in four concepts that constitute a broad conceptual theory of crisis management according to the Islamic approach. These concepts are: Crisis management strategies in Islam, the stages of crisis management, the characteristics of a leader who manages crises, and the roles of a leader during the crisis management process. A number of assumptions have been made of this generated theory about Islamic crisis management model. In light of the results of this study, recommendations were formulated that indicate the necessity of training leaders in the Islamic approach to crisis management, its strategies and its scientific steps in crisis management.

A substantial proportion of lapses are due to urges to smoke triggered by situational cues. Currently, no available interventions proactively respond to such cues in real time. Quit Sense is a theory-guided just-in-time adaptive intervention smartphone app that uses a learning tool and smartphone sensing to provide in-the-moment tailored support to help smokers manage cue-induced urges to smoke. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to assess the feasibility of delivering a definitive online efficacy trial of Quit Sense. METHODS AND ANALYSES: A two-arm parallel-group RCT allocating smokers willing to make a quit attempt, recruited via online adverts, to usual care (referral to the NHS SmokeFree website) or usual care plus Quit Sense. Randomisation will be stratified by smoking rate (<16 vs &#8805;16 cigarettes/day) and socioeconomic status (low vs high). Recruitment, enrolment, baseline data collection, allocation and intervention delivery will be automated through the study website. Outcomes will be collected at 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up via the study website or telephone, and during app usage. The study aims to recruit 200 smokers to estimate key feasibility outcomes, the preliminary impact of Quit Sense and potential cost-effectiveness, in addition to gaining insights on user views of the app through qualitative interviews. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been granted by the Wales NHS Research Ethics Committee 7 (19/WA/0361). The findings will be disseminated to the public, the funders, relevant practice and policy representatives and other researchers.

Medical and allied healthcare appointments and surgeries are being temporarily postponed. Mandatory self-isolation has created new obstacles for individuals with endometriosis seeking pain relief and improvement in their quality of life. Anxieties may be heightened by concerns over whether endometriosis may be an underlying condition that could predispose to severe COVID-19 infection and what constitutes an appropriate indication for presentation for urgent treatment in the epidemic. Furthermore, the restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 can impose negative psychological effects, which patients with endometriosis may be more prone to already. In combination with medical therapies, or as an alternative, we encourage patients to consider self-management strategies to combat endometriosis symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. These self-management strategies are divided into problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies, with the former aiming to change the environment to alleviate pain, and the latter address the psychology of living with endometriosis. We put forward this guidance, which is based on evidence and expert opinion, for healthcare providers to utilize during their consultations with patients via telephone or video. Patients may also independently use this article as an educational resource. The strategies discussed are not exclusively restricted to consideration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most have been researched before this period of time and all will continue to be a part of the biopsychological approach to endometriosis long after COVID-19 restrictions are lifted.","Leonardi, Mathew; Horne, Andrew W.; Vincent, Katy; Sinclair, Justin; Sherman, Kerry A.; Ciccia, Donna; Condous, George; Johnson, Neil P.; Armour, Mike",Hum.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional design with a self-selecting sample. Data collected in February 2020. SETTING: Community dwellers in China. PARTICIPANTS: 2956 participants aged 16 and above completed the study and were included in the analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Nationwide COVID-19 survey. Demographics and self-reported compliance with four personal protective measures-home quarantine, mask-wearing, temperature-taking and hand-sanitising were collected. Outbreak severity and timeliness of personal protection order were obtained from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention website. Logistic regression models were employed to examine the association between demographic and social indicators and behavioural compliance. RESULTS: Compliance with home quarantine was only associated with gender (men, OR=0.61 (0.51-0.73), inverse association) but no other indicators. In contrast, men had higher compliance with mask-wearing (OR=1.79 (1.49-2.16)) and temperature-taking (OR=1.27 (1.05-1.53)). Compared with younger adults (&#8804;20 years), the middle-age groups (31-40 and 41-50 years of age) were more compliant with all protective behaviours, except for home quarantine (OR=0.71 (0.54-0.93) and 0.67 (0.46-0.97), respectively). CONCLUSION: Male gender was associated with lower compliance with home quarantine yet higher compliance with mask-wearing and temperature-taking. The middle-age participants (31-50 years) had lower compliance with home quarantine but higher with other measures. These findings may be supported by the economic considerations and the long-inherited Confucian values among Chinese. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, public health authorities should tailor policy implementation to disparities in psychosocial indicators.","Xu, Xin; Chew, Kimberly Ann; Xu, Xiaolin; Wu, Zhihua; Xiao, Xiaohua; Yang, Qian",BMJ Open,55,21

One of the main bases of this plan is the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASPs). This study aimed to evaluate community pharmacists’ awareness and perception towards antimicrobial resistance and ASPs in Jordan. Thus, a qualitative study was conducted through in-depth interviews with twenty community pharmacists. Convenience sampling was used in the study. Qualitative analysis of the data yielded four themes and eleven sub-themes. All the respondents showed a good understanding of the causes of antimicrobial resistance. The most important cause reported by them was the non-restricted prescription of antimicrobials. Most of the pharmacists believed that they are competent to provide ASPs, however, they believed that there are several barriers against the implementation of ASPs in community pharmacies in Jordan. Barriers demonstrated by the pharmacists, included organizational obstacles, resources obstacles, and personal obstacles. In conclusion, this study revealed several barriers against the implementation of ASPs in community pharmacies in Jordan. Incorporating ASPs in the community pharmacy settings requires proper pharmacist training, several academic disciplines team efforts, and good pharmacy practice of antimicrobial guidelines.","Saleh, Doaa Abu-Farha Rana Mukattash Tareq L.; Barakat, Muna Alefishat Eman",Antibiotics,55,20

Currently, the diagnosis is based on molecular real time RT-PCR techniques, although their implementation is being threatened due to the extraordinary demand for supplies worldwide. That is why the development of alternative and / or complementary tests becomes so relevant.

Early identification of infected individuals is regarded as one of the most important prerequisites for fighting the pandemic and for returning to a 'New Normal'. Large-scale testing is therefore crucial, but is facing several challenges including shortage of sample collection tools and of molecular biological reagents, and the need for safe electronic communication of medical reports. We present the successful establishment of a holistic SARS-CoV-2 testing platform that covers proband registration, sample collection and shipment, sample testing, and report issuing. The RT-PCR-based virus detection, being central to the platform, was extensively validated: sensitivity and specificity were defined as 96.8% and 100%, respectively; intra-run and inter-run precision were <3%. A novel type of sample swab and an in-house-developed RNA extraction system were shown to perform as good as commercially available products. The resulting flexibility guarantees independence from the current bottlenecks in SARS-CoV-2 testing. Based on our technology, we offered testing at local, national, and global levels. In the present study, we report the results from approx. 18,000 SARS-CoV-2 tests in almost 10,000 individuals from a low-frequency SARS-CoV-2 pandemic area in a homogenous geographical region in north-eastern Germany for a period of 10 weeks (21 March to 31 May 2020). Among the probands, five SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were identified. Comparative analysis of corresponding virus genomes revealed a diverse origin from three of the five currently recognized SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic clades. Our study exemplifies how preventive SARS-CoV-2 testing can be set up in a rapid and flexible manner. The application of our test has enabled a safe maintenance/resume of critical local infrastructure, e.g., nursing homes where more than 5000 elderlies and caretakers got tested.

We propose a method for enhancing data sets containing faces without masks by creating synthetic masks and overlaying them on faces in the original images. Our method relies on SparkAR Studio, a developer program made by Facebook that is used to create Instagram face filters. In our approach, we use 9 masks of different colors, shapes and fabrics. We employ our method to generate a number of 445,446 (90%) samples of masks for the CASIA-WebFace data set and 196,254 (96.8%) masks for the CelebA data set, releasing the mask images at https://github.com/securifai/masked_faces. We show that our method produces significantly more realistic training examples of masks overlaid on faces by asking volunteers to qualitatively compare it to other methods or data sets designed for the same task. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our method by evaluating state-of-the-art face recognition systems (FaceNet, VGG-face, ArcFace) trained on our enhanced data sets and showing that they outperform equivalent systems trained on original data sets (containing faces without masks) or competing data sets (containing masks generated by related methods), when the test benchmarks contain masked faces.","Mare, Tudor; Duta, Georgian; Georgescu, Mariana-Iuliana; Sandru, Adrian; Alexe, Bogdan; Popescu, Marius; Ionescu, Radu Tudor",,55,1

METHODS: We assemble a county-level data set that contains COVID-19-confirmed cases through June 28, 2020, and various sociodemographic measures from multiple sources. In addition to an aspatial regression model, we conduct spatial lag, spatial error, and spatial autoregressive combined models to systematically examine the role of spatial structure in shaping geographical disparities in the COVID-19 period prevalence. RESULTS: The aspatial ordinary least squares regression model tends to overestimate the COVID-19 period prevalence among counties with low observed rates, but this issue can be effectively addressed by spatial modeling. Spatial models can better estimate the period prevalence for counties, especially along the Atlantic coasts and through the Black Belt. Overall, the model fit among counties along both coasts is generally good with little variability evident, but in the Plain states, the model fit is conspicuous in its heterogeneity across counties. CONCLUSIONS: Spatial models can help partially explain the geographic disparities in the COVID-19 period prevalence. These models reveal spatial variability in the model fit including identifying regions of the country where the fit is heterogeneous and worth closer attention in the immediate short term.","Sun, Feinuo; Matthews, Stephen A; Yang, Tse-Chuan; Hu, Ming-Hsiao",Ann. epidemiol,55,20

Here, we investigate both in concert, by imaging ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in primary visual cortex (V1) across different cortical depths. We ensured that putative ODC patterns in V1 (a) are stable across runs, sessions, and scanners located in different continents, (b) have a width (â¼1.3 mm) expected from post-mortem and animal work and (c) are absent at the retinotopic location of the blind spot. We then dissociated the effects of bottom-up thalamo-cortical input and attentional feedback processes on activity in V1 across cortical depth. Importantly, the separation of bottom-up information flows into ODCs allowed us to validly compare attentional conditions while keeping the stimulus identical throughout the experiment. We find that, when correcting for draining vein effects and using both model-based and model-free approaches, the effect of monocular stimulation is largest at deep and middle cortical depths. Conversely, spatial attention influences BOLD activity exclusively near the pial surface. Our findings show that simultaneous interrogation of columnar and laminar dimensions of the cortical fold can dissociate thalamocortical inputs from top-down processing, and allow the investigation of their interactions without any stimulus manipulation.","de Hollander, Gilles; van der Zwaag, Wietske; Qian, Chencan; Zhang, Peng; Knapen, Tomas",Neuroimage,55,16

Current theoretical explanations converge on a single point: cooperators can prevail when they cluster in social space. However, we know very little about the real-world mechanisms that drive such clustering, particularly in systems where cognitive limitations make it unlikely that mechanisms such as score keeping and reputation are at play. Here, we show that Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) use a 'walk away' strategy, a simple social heuristic by which assortment by cooperativeness can come about among mobile agents. Guppies cooperate during predator inspection and we found that when experiencing defection in this context, individuals prefer to move to a new social environment, despite having no prior information about this new social group. Our results provide evidence in non-human animals that individuals use a simple social partner updating strategy in response to defection, supporting theoretical work applying heuristics to understanding the proximate mechanisms underpinning the evolution of cooperation among non-kin.","Darden, Safi K; James, Richard; Cave, James M; Brask, Josefine Bohr; Croft, Darren P",Proc Biol Sci,55,21

This study is an evaluation of the use of PC during the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at a single hospital. METHODS: Fifty patients with AC were admitted as of the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey through June 2020. Patients with pancreatitis, cholangitis, and/or incomplete data were excluded from the study. Data of the remaining 36 patients included in the study were recorded and a descriptive statistical analysis was performed. The patients were divided into three groups: PC (n=14), only conservative treatment with antibiotherapy (OC) (n=14), and LC (n=8). The findings were compared with a group of 70 similar patients from the pre-pandemic period. RESULTS: The mean age of the pandemic period patients was 53 years (range: 26-78 years). The female/male ratio was 1.11. PC was preferred in eight (11%) patients in the same period of the previous year, whereas 14 (39%) patients underwent PC in the pandemic period. Four of the 36 pandemic patients were positive for COVID-19, including one member of the PC group. There was one (7.1%) mortality in the pandemic-period PC group due to cardiac arrest. The length of hospital stay between the groups based on the type of treatment was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: LC is not recommended during the pandemic period; PC can be an effective and safe alternative for the treatment of AC.","Somuncu, Erkan; Kara, Yasin; Kizilkaya, Mehmet Celal; Bozdag, Emre; Yildiz, Zeynep Betül; Özkan, Cenk; Sener, Aziz; Gökay, Ridvan; Aydin, Mahmut Ozan; Bozkurt, Mehmet Abdussamet; Kocatas, Ali",Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg,55,24

Thrombosis and coagulopathy, associated with pulmonary injury and inflammation, are emerging clinical features of COVID-19. We present a framework for mechanisms of thrombosis in COVID-19 that initially derive from interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2, resulting in dysregulation of angiotensin signaling and subsequent inflammation and tissue injury. These responses result in increased signaling by thrombin (proteinase-activated) and purinergic receptors, which promote platelet activation and exert pathological effects on other cell types (e.g., endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts), further enhancing inflammation and injury. Inhibitors of thrombin and purinergic receptors may thus have therapeutic effects by blunting platelet-mediated thromboinflammation and dysfunction in other cell types. Such inhibitors include agents (e.g., anti-platelet drugs) approved for other indications and that could be repurposed to treat, and potentially improve the outcome of, COVID-19 patients.","Sriram, Krishna; Insel, Paul A",Physiol. rev,55,16

DESIGN: An anonymous, nonvalidated, cross-sectional survey was conducted online. Data were collected from April 7 through 16, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Second-year U.S. vitreoretinal surgery fellows in two-year training programs were invited to participate. METHODS: Online survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survey questions assessed policies guiding COVID-19 response, exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, changes in clinical duties, and methods to reduce occupational risk, including availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). RESULTS: Completed responses were obtained from 62 of 87 eligible recipients (71.2% response rate). Training settings included academic (58.1%), hybrid academic/private practice (35.5%), and private practice only settings (6.5%). Overall, 19.4% of respondents reported an exposure to a COVID-19-positive patient, 14.5% reported self-quarantining due to possible exposure, and 11.3% reported being tested for COVID-19. In regards to PPE, N95 masks were available in the emergency room (n = 40 [64.5%]), office (n = 35 [56.5%]), and operating room (n = 35 [56.5%]) settings. Perceived comfort level with PPE recommendations was significantly associated with availability of an N95 respirator mask in the clinic (P < 0.001), emergency room (P < 0.001), or operating room (P = 0.002) settings. Additional risk mitigation methods outside of PPE were: reduction in patient volume (n = 62 [100%]), limiting patient companions (n = 59 [95.2%]), use of a screening process (n = 59 [95.2%]), use of a slit-lamp face shield (n = 57 [91.9%]), temperature screening of all persons entering clinical space (n = 34 [54.84%]), and placement of face mask on patients (n = 33 [53.2%]).

Results supported the feasibility and acceptability of MBCT/MBSR-VC. Considerations of safety were largely unreported. MBCT/MBSR-VC demonstrated medium positive effects on mental health outcomes compared with inactive controls (ds = 0.44 -0.71), and little difference compared with active controls like in-person delivery (all confidence intervals crossed zero). Evidence regarding mindfulness or self-compassion as potential mechanisms of action was inconclusive. Future implementation research should target mental health populations using noninferiority designs. Adapting MBCT/MBSR to remote delivery will require development of guidelines and training packages to ensure best practice in this medium and adherence to evidence-based MBCT/MBSR models.","Moulton-Perkins, Alesia; Moulton, Duncan; Cavanagh, Kate; Jozavi, Alex; Strauss, Clara",J.

Only 65.7% desired SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for themselves, and 70.1% for their child. Mean state anxiety (S-anxiety) score was significantly higher than mean trait anxiety (T-anxiety) score (44.9, 95%CI 43.5-46.3 vs. 41.6, 95%CI 38.7-44.5; p = 0.03), with both scores significantly higher than previously published norms. In an adjusted regression model, less frequent news viewing was associated with significantly lower S-anxiety score. Mean EQ-5D-3L VAS score for the population was significantly lower vs. established US normative data (71.4 CI 67.4-75.5, std. error 2 vs. societal mean 80, std. error 0.1; p < 0.001). EQ-5D-3L VAS score was bimodal (highest with hourly and no viewing) and significantly reduced with less media viewership in an adjusted model. CONCLUSIONS: Among a nationally representative sample, there were higher S-anxiety and lower EQ-5D-3L VAS scores compared to non-pandemic normative data, indicative of a potential detrimental acute effect of the pandemic. More frequent daily media viewership was significantly associated with higher S-anxiety but also predictive of higher health utility, as measured by EQ-5D-3L VAS scores.","Greenhawt, Matthew; Kimball, Spencer; DunnGalvin, Audrey; Abrams, Elissa M; Shaker, Marcus S; Mosnaim, Giselle; Comberiati, Pasquale; Nekliudov, Nikita A; Blyuss, Oleg; Teufel, Martin; Munblit, Daniel",J. gen. intern. med,55,2

METHODS: Forty participants were randomly assigned into experimental and control groups. The experimental group did the VR exercises while smelling the lavender oil scents. The control group did the VR exercises without it. Both groups did the exercises in ten 45-min sessions. We assessed the participants with the timed up and go (TUG) test, Berg balance scale (BBS), fall efficacy scale - international (FES-I), and the 29-item multiple sclerosis impact scale (MSIS-29). We did the tests at the baseline and after the last exercise session. RESULTS: The experimental group performed significantly better in the BBS (p = 0.007), TUG (p = 0.045), and FES-I (p = 0.016) tests as well as in the MSIS-29's psychological subscale (p = 0.034) than did the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Using lavender oil as olfactory stimulus while doing the VR exercises can improve balance and reduce fear of falling down compared to doing the VR exercises without it in people with multiple sclerosis. Implications for rehabilitation It seems that using lavender oil, as an olfactory stimulus, while doing vestibular rehabilitation exercises can improve balance and reduce fear of falling down in people with multiple sclerosis compared to doing the vestibular rehabilitation exercises without it. This treatment significantly alleviates the psychological effects of multiple sclerosis on daily life such as sleeping problems, feeling unwell, anxious, tense, depressed, etc.","Seddighi-Khavidak, Maryam; Tahan, Nahid; Akbarzadeh-Baghban, Alireza",Disabil Rehabil,55,22

This study evaluates the impact of universal face mask use on rates and outcomes of post-injection endophthalmitis (PIE). DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter, comparative cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Eyes receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF injections from October 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, at 12 centers. METHODS: Cases were divided into a ""no face mask"" group if no face masks were worn by the physician or patient during intravitreal injections or a ""universal face mask"" group if face masks were worn by the physician, ancillary staff, and patient during intravitreal injections. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of endophthalmitis, microbial spectrum, and visual acuity (VA). RESULTS: Of 505 968 intravitreal injections administered in 110 547 eyes, 85 of 294 514 (0.0289%; 1 in 3464 injections) cases of presumed endophthalmitis occurred in the ""no face mask"" group, and 45 of 211 454 (0.0213%; 1 in 4699) cases occurred in the ""universal face mask"" group (odds ratio [OR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-1.18; P = 0.097). In the ""no face mask"" group, there were 27 cases (0.0092%; 1 in 10 908 injections) of culture-positive endophthalmitis compared with 9 cases (0.004%; 1 in 23 494) in the ""universal face mask"" group (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22-0.99; P = 0.041). Three cases of oral flora-associated endophthalmitis occurred in the ""no face mask"" group (0.001%; 1 in 98 171 injections) compared with 1 (0.0005%; 1 in 211 454) in the ""universal face mask"" group (P = 0.645). Patients presented a mean (range) 4.9 (1-30) days after the causative injection, and mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) VA at endophthalmitis presentation was 2.04 (~20/2200) for ""no face mask"" group compared with 1.65 (~20/900) for the ""universal face mask"" group (P = 0.022), although no difference was observed 3 months after treatment (P = 0.764). CONCLUSIONS: In a large, multicenter, retrospective study, physician and patient face mask use during intravitreal anti-VEGF injections did not alter the risk of presumed acute-onset bacterial endophthalmitis, but there was a reduced rate of culture-positive endophthalmitis. Three months after presentation, there was no difference in VA between the groups.","Patel, Samir N; Tang, Peter H; Storey, Philip P; Wolfe, Jeremy D; Fein, Jordana; Shah, Sumit P; Chen, Eric; Abbey, Ashkan; Ferrone, Philip J; Shah, Chirag P; Liang, Michelle C; Stem, Maxwell S; Ali Khan, M; Yonekawa, Yoshihiro; Garg, Sunir J",Ophthalmology,55,24

A COVID-19 Case Study,15.305465,3.6689105,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, reliable diagnostics are absolutely indispensable. Molecular SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics based on nucleic acids (NA) derived from oro- or nasopharyngeal swabs constitute the current gold standard. Given the importance of test results, it is crucial to assess the quality of the underlying swab samples and NA extraction procedures. We determined NA concentrations in clinical samples used for SARS-CoV-2 testing applying an NA-specific dye. In comparison to cut-offs defined by SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, internal positive controls, and references from a federal laboratory, 90.85% (923 of 1016) of swabs contained NA concentrations enabling SARS-CoV-2 recognition. Swabs collected by local health authorities and the central emergency department either had significantly higher NA concentrations or were less likely to exhibit insufficient quality, arguing in favor of sampling centers with routined personnel. Interestingly, samples taken from females had significantly higher NA concentrations than those from males. Among eight longitudinal patient sample sets with intermitting negative RT-qPCR results, two showed reduced NA concentrations in negative specimens. The herein described fluorescence-based NA quantification approach is immediately applicable to evaluate swab qualities, optimize sampling strategies, identify patient-specific differences, and explain some peculiar test results including intermittent negative samples with low NA concentrations.

Whereas the demands of the neoliberal university rely upon a hegemonic work-centric model that can affect academics irrespective of gender, women are more likely to experience work-life conflict and its associated impacts. This article focuses on how work-life conflict has been studied with three main objectives. First, to map the challenges of combining work and private life in the neoliberalised university. Second, to conduct a systematic review of the literature on work-life balance in academia. Third, to discuss findings and limitations in order to propose research recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of HH in reducing nosocomial infection, few empirical studies have quantitatively investigated the impacts of unit shape and size, and the resulted visibility and accessibility on HH, due to the lack of consistent methods to measure and evaluate visibility. METHODS: The research was developed as a cross-sectional comparative study of two nursing units (Units A and B) with similar patient acuity and nursing care model but different shape and layout. The study applied quantitative research methods including visibility and accessibility analysis using space syntax, 1-week on-site observation, and secondary data analysis on HH compliance rates. RESULTS: Results indicate that the unit with higher visibility and accessibility is associated with higher HH frequencies. Unit B has significantly higher visibility of HSDs, p < .001, t(60) = 4.615, and significantly higher frequency of HH activity occurrences, 5.17% versus 1.52%; p < .001, t(16.750) = 5.332, than Unit A, even though Unit B has lower HSD to bed ratio (0.708:1 vs. 1.375:1). The linear regression models also demonstrate that visibility and accessibility of HSDs are significant predictors of HH behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this exploratory study identified the importance of visibility of HSDs to improve the chances of HH. It also points out the impacts of nursing unit typology on the visibility of HSDs and in turn affects HH behavior.","Cai, Hui; Tyne, Intisar Ameen; Spreckelmeyer, Kent; Williams, Jennifer",HERD,55,24

METHODS: This case-control study was conducted at Sakarya Educational and Research Hospital, Toyota Hospital and Yenikent State Hospital between March 18, 2020 and August 30, 2020. The study included a case group of 125 randomly selected patients who had been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis in advance of having COVID-19 and a control group of 125 patients without allergic rhinitis who were diagnosed with COVID-19. We evaluated all participants' statuses regarding smoking, symptoms, and hospitalization, as well as the length of their hospitalization and the number of their comorbidities. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding percentage of asymptomatic patients (p = 0.27), presence of smoking (p = 0.068), hospitalization status (p = 0.79), and hospitalization length (p = 0.55).

The disease, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is primarily known as a respiratory tract infection. Although SARS-CoV-2 directly invades the lungs, COVID-19 is a complex multi-system disease with varying degrees of severity and affects several human systems including the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, hematopoietic, and immune systems. From the existing data, most COVID-19 cases develop a mild disease typically presented with fever and respiratory illness. However, in some patients, clinical evidence suggests that COVID-19 might progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ dysfunction, and septic shock resulting in a critical condition. Likewise, specific organ dysfunction seems to be related to the disease complication, worsens the condition, and increases the lethality of COVID-19. The neurological manifestations in association with disease severity and mortality have been reported in COVID-19 patients. Despite the continuously increasing reports of the neurological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, our knowledge about the possible routes of nervous system involvement associated with COVID-19 is limited.

However, the drivers of BTSC resistance to therapy remain unknown. The cytokine receptor for oncostatin M (OSMR) regulates BTSC proliferation and glioblastoma tumorigenesis. Here, we report our discovery of a mitochondrial OSMR that confers resistance to IR via regulation of oxidative phosphorylation, independent of its role in cell proliferation. Mechanistically, OSMR is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix via the presequence translocase-associated motor complex components, mtHSP70 and TIM44. OSMR interacts with NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase 1/2 (NDUFS1/2) of complex I and promotes mitochondrial respiration. Deletion of OSMR impairs spare respiratory capacity, increases reactive oxygen species, and sensitizes BTSCs to IR-induced cell death. Importantly, suppression of OSMR improves glioblastoma response to IR and prolongs lifespan.","Sharanek, Ahmad; Burban, Audrey; Laaper, Matthew; Heckel, Emilie; Joyal, Jean-Sebastien; Soleimani, Vahab D; Jahani-Asl, Arezu",Nat Commun,55,24

But no studies to date have systematically described liver test abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with abnormal liver test results. METHODS: Clinical records and laboratory results were obtained from 417 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China from January 11 to February 21, 2020 and followed up to March 7, 2020. Information on clinical features of patients with abnormal liver tests were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Of 417 patients with COVID-19, 318 (76.3%) had abnormal liver test results and 90 (21.5%) had liver injury during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests became more pronounced during hospitalization within 2 weeks, with 49 (23.4%), 31 (14.8%), 24 (11.5%) and 51 (24.4%) patients having alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels elevated to more than 3× the upper limit of normal, respectively. Patients with abnormal liver tests of hepatocellular type or mixed type at admission had higher odds of progressing to severe disease (odds ratios [ORs] 2.73; 95% CI 1.19-6.3, and 4.44, 95% CI 1.93-10.23, respectively). The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was also found to lead to increased odds of liver injury (OR from 4.44 to 5.03, both p <0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with abnormal liver tests were at higher risk of progressing to severe disease. The detrimental effects on liver injury mainly related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which should be monitored and evaluated frequently. LAY SUMMARY: Data on liver tests in patients with COVID-19 are scarce. We observed a high prevalence of liver test abnormalities and liver injury in 417 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our referral center, and the prevalence increased substantially during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests and liver injury were associated with the progression to severe pneumonia.

Multipotency of MSC may result in both desirable and undesirable cells, post-transplantation. A better strategy to attain desired cells may be in vitro commitment of hADMSCs to uni-/bi- potent neural progenitor cells (NPCs), prior to transplantation. Derivation of stable NPCs may require a suitable niche eliciting proliferation and differentiation signals. The present study designed a biomimetic niche comprising insoluble fibrin supported adhesion matrix and exogenously added growth factors (GFs) for deriving different neural cells and established the role of Notch and Wnt signals for proliferation and differentiation of hADMSCs, respectively. The stable transformation of hADMSCs into neurospheres (NS) comprising Nestin+ve NPCs was achieved consistently. Slight modifications of niche enable differentiation of NS to NPCs; NPCs to neurons; NPCs to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs); and OPCs to oligodendrocytes (OLG). Fibrin plays a crucial role in the conversion of hADMSC to NS and NPCs to OPCs; but, not essential for OPC to OLG maturation. Co-survival and cell-cell interaction of NPC derived neurons and OPCs promoting OLG maturation is illustrated. The designed biomimetic niche shows the potential for directing autologous ADMSCs to neural cells for applications in regenerative medicine.","Chandrababu, Krishnapriya; Senan, Manesh; Krishnan, Lissy K",Sci Rep,55,5

As the most common route of transmission is via aerosols and droplet inhalation, it is critical for healthcare workers to have the correct personal protective equipment (PPE) including gowns, masks and goggles. Surgical masks are not effective in preventing the influenza and SARS, so they are unlikely to be able to resist contaminated aerosols from entering the respiratory system. Therefore, it is vital to use respirators which have been proven to offer better protection against droplets, aerosols and fluid penetration and which form a tight seal around the mouth and nose. Various types of respirators are used in healthcare settings, such as half-mask filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). The most commonly used FFR is the N95 disposable respirator, which is tight fitting and has a 95% or above particle filtering efficiency for a median particle size of 0.3 µm. This review discusses respirators, their purpose, types, clinical efficiency and proper donning and doffing techniques.","Umer, F; Haji, Z; Zafar, K",Int Endod J,55,20

Examples of NTC include human ethics, teamwork, and professionalism. Human donors and laboratory experiences typically serve as the foundation of NTC curriculum development and assessment. With many global institutions shifting from in-person, human dissections to virtual laboratories, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we sought to explore anatomists? views on NTC within this novel virtual environment. MethodsEngaging mixed methods study design, and a pragmatist theoretical lens - a voluntary survey (IU IRB# 2006285000) was developed and distributed internationally from July to November 2020. Additional to demographic information (including information about courses taught), questions about anatomists? views of the importance, extent and types of NTC relevant to student learning were posed. The context included anatomists? perceptions of these NTC both prior to and during their pandemic teaching experiences. Data were analyzed using SPSS v. 27. Differences between NTC and their assessment prior to and during the pandemic were compared using paired samples t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Free responses were analyzed using thematic analysis.Results Survey responses (n=82) represented all continents except Antarctica. Pre-COVID-19, respondents delivered 12% of their content online which increased to 66% online content delivery during the pandemic. Regarding the NTC, respondents expected students to acquire, only 37% is formally assessed. Overall, there was a significant decrease in the NTC assessment during the pandemic (p=0.001). Greater than 35% of respondents reported assessing the following content pre-COVID-19: respect for donors, teamwork, communication, clinical reasoning, and professionalism. During COVID-19, almost all of these categories significantly decreased in the number of respondents who planned to assess these (p≤ 0.001). Fifty-five respondents (67%) provided free responses highlighting concerns about acquisition of empathy, respect for donors, and teamwork due to reduced or eliminated dissection. ConclusionAnatomy educators report incorporating strategies into their courses to foster student development of NTC. Acquisition of these important skills remains largely a part of the hidden curriculum based on percentage of respondents assessing them. This percentage further decreased in the virtual environment. Given the availability of formative assessment types we encourage more robust and explicit incorporation into the formal curriculum.","Mussell, Jason Harrell Kelly VanNuland Sonya Brewer-Deluce Danielle Cornwall Jon Krebs Claudia Lazarus Michelle MacLeod Anna Wainman Bruce Hildebrandt Sabine Byram Jessica",The FASEB Journal,55,26

The simulation tool is used to assess the effects of various interventions, assuming parameters that reflect the situation in Austria as an example. RESULTS: Strict contact reduction including isolation of infected persons in quarantine wards and at home can substantially delay the peak of the epidemic. Home isolation of infected individuals effectively reduces the height of the peak. Contact reduction by social distancing, e.g., by curfews, sanitary behavior, etc. are also effective in delaying the epidemic peak. CONCLUSIONS: Contact-reducing mechanisms are efficient to delay the peak of the epidemic. They might also be effective in decreasing the peak number of infections depending on seasonal fluctuations in the transmissibility of the disease.","Schneider, Kristan A; Ngwa, Gideon A; Schwehm, Markus; Eichner, Linda; Eichner, Martin",BMC Infect Dis,55,29

As long as effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, self-isolation and quarantine as well as far-reaching shutdowns of economic activity and public life are the only available strategies to prevent the virus from spreading. These interventions must meet conflicting requirements where some objectives, like the minimization of disease-related deaths or the impact on health systems, demand for stronger counter-measures, while others, such as social and economic costs, call for weaker counter-measures. Therefore, finding the optimal compromise of counter-measures requires the solution of a multi-objective optimization problem that is based on accurate prediction of future infection spreading for all combinations of counter-measures under consideration. We present a strategy for construction and solution of such a multi-objective optimization problem with real-world applicability. The strategy is based on a micro-model allowing for accurate prediction via a realistic combination of person-centric data-driven human mobility and behavior, stochastic infection models and disease progression models including micro-level inclusion of governmental intervention strategies. For this micro-model, a surrogate macro-model is constructed and validated that is much less computationally expensive and can therefore be used in the core of a numerical solver for the multi-objective optimization problem. The resulting set of optimal compromises between counter-measures (Pareto front) is discussed and its meaning for policy decisions is outlined.","Wulkow, Hanna; Conrad, Tim O F; Djurdjevac Conrad, Natasa; Müller, Sebastian A; Nagel, Kai; Schütte, Christof",PLoS One,55,16

Method: We analyzed data from a survey conducted by the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology Task Force on Airway Management on endotracheal intubation in 98 patients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed through nucleic acid testing and chest computed tomography. The multivariate logistic model with stepwise selection was used for selecting the predictive factors significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the corresponding anesthesiologists. Results: SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the corresponding anesthesiologists was 20.41% after intubation in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Univariate analysis indicated that intubation for elective treatment, intubation in an operating room or isolation ward, and routine rapid induction with continuous positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) for intubation were associated with a lower SARS-CoV-2 risk in the anesthesiologists. Multivariate analysis revealed that intubation for elective treatment was associated with a significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 risk (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14-0.68, P &lt; 0.0001), and coughing by patients during endotracheal intubation was associated with a significantly increased SARS-CoV-2 risk (aOR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.39-2.97, P = 0.0404) in the anesthesiologists. Conclusion: Endotracheal intubation for elective treatments, intubation in an operating room or isolation ward, and routine rapid induction with continuous PPV for patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 are associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in practicing anesthesiologists, and coughing by patients during intubation increases the risk.","Sun, M.; Zhang, J.; Zhang, W.; Li, N.; Zuo, M.; Qin, L.; Wu, S.

In this study, we have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to systematically evaluate the effect of 10 cardiometabolic risk factors and genetic liability to lifetime smoking on 97 circulating host proteins postulated to either interact or contribute to the maladaptive host response of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach and several robust MR methods in a two-sample setting to systemically estimate the genetically predicted effect of each risk factor in turn on levels of each circulating protein. Multivariable MR was conducted to simultaneously evaluate the effects of multiple risk factors on the same protein. We also applied MR using cis-regulatory variants at the genomic location responsible for encoding these proteins to estimate whether their circulating levels may influence severe SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: In total, we identified evidence supporting 105 effects between risk factors and circulating proteins which were robust to multiple testing corrections and sensitivity analyzes. For example, body mass index provided evidence of an effect on 23 circulating proteins with a variety of functions, such as inflammatory markers c-reactive protein (IVW Beta=0.34 per standard deviation change, 95% CI=0.26 to 0.41, P = 2.19 × 10-16) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IVW Beta=0.23, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.30, P = 9.04 × 10-12). Further analyzes using multivariable MR provided evidence that the effect of BMI on lowering immunoglobulin G, an antibody class involved in protection from infection, is substantially mediated by raised triglycerides levels (IVW Beta=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.25 to -0.12, P = 2.32 × 10-08, proportion mediated=44.1%). The strongest evidence that any of the circulating proteins highlighted by our initial analysis influence severe SARS-CoV-2 was identified for soluble glycoprotein 130 (odds ratio=1.81, 95% CI=1.25 to 2.62, P = 0.002), a signal transductor for interleukin-6 type cytokines which are involved in inflammatory response. However, based on current case samples for severe SARS-CoV-2 we were unable to replicate findings in independent samples. INTERPRETATION: Our findings highlight several key proteins which are influenced by established exposures for disease. Future research to determine whether these circulating proteins mediate environmental effects onto risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or covid-19 progression are warranted to help elucidate therapeutic strategies for severe covid-19 disease.

DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: A single tertiary, university-affiliated medical centre in Israel. Time period, 1 June 2020 through to 31 July 2020. POPULATION: Women who were hospitalised in a single tertiary medical centre, who were diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection by a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test. METHODS: Women were diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection by a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test. Vaginal RT-PCR swabs were obtained from all study participants after a proper cleansing of the perineum. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal RT-PCR swabs. RESULTS: Vaginal and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 35 women, aged 21-93 years. Twenty-one women (60%) were in their reproductive years, of whom, five were in their third trimester of pregnancy. Most of the participants (57%) were healthy without any underlying medical conditions. Of the 35 patients sampled, 2 (5.7%) had a positive vaginal RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, one was premenopausal and the other was a postmenopausal woman. Both women had mild disease. CONCLUSION: Our findings contradict most previous reports, which did not detect the presence of viral colonisation in the vagina. Although passage through the birth canal exposes neonates to the vaginal polymicrobial flora, an acquisition of pathogens does not necessarily mandate neonatal infection or clinical disease. Nevertheless, when delivering the infant of a woman with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, a clinician should consider the possibility of vaginal colonisation, even if it is uncommon. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: When delivering the infant of a woman with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, a clinician should consider the possibility of vaginal colonisation.","Schwartz, A; Yogev, Y; Zilberman, A; Alpern, S; Many, A; Yousovich, R; Gamzu, R",BJOG,55,24

Several shortcomings in the existing infectious disease management system were exposed during the pandemic, which hindered the control of the disease globally. To cope with this issue, we propose a window-period framework to reveal the general rule of the progression of management of infectious diseases and to help with decision making at the early stage of epidemics with a focus on healthcare provisions. METHODS: The framework has two significant periods (dark-window period and bright-window period). Outbreak of COVID-19 in China was used as an example for the application of the framework. RESULTS: The framework could reflect the progression of the epidemic objectively. The spread increased slowly in the dark-window period, but rocketed up in the bright-window period. The beginning of the bright-window period was the time when healthcare personnel were exposed to a substantially high risk of nosocomial infection. Additionally, proper and prompt preventive actions during the dark-window and bright-window periods were substantially important to reduce the future spreading of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: It was recommended that when possible healthcare provisions should upgrade to the highest level of alert for the control of an unknown epidemic in the dark-window period, while countermeasures in the bright-window period could be accordingly adjusted with full exploration and considerations. The framework may provide some insights into how to accelerate the control of future epidemics promptly and effectively.","Li, Ziyi; Li, Cheng; Wu, Xinyin; Li, Guanming; Li, Guowei; Tian, Junzhang",Int J Clin Pract,55,27

The association of antihypertensive medications with outcomes in patients with hypertension is not fully described. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), responsible for host entry of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) leading to COVID-19, is postulated to be upregulated in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Here, we evaluated the occurrence of pulmonary adverse drug events (ADEs) in patients with hypertension receiving ACEIs/ARBs to determine if disparities exist between individual drugs within the respective classes using data from the FDA Spontaneous Reporting Systems. For this purpose, we proposed the proportional reporting ratio to provide a statistical summary for the commonality of an ADE for a specific drug as compared to the entire database for drugs in the same or other classes. In addition, a statistical procedure, multiple logistic regression analysis, was employed to correct hidden confounders when causative covariates are underreported or untrusted to correct analyses of drug-ADE combinations. To date, analyses have been focused on drug classes rather than individual drugs which may have different ADE profiles depending on the underlying diseases present. A retrospective analysis of thirteen pulmonary ADEs showed significant differences associated with quinapril and trandolapril, compared to other ACEIs and ARBs. Specifically, quinapril and trandolapril were found to have a statistically significantly higher incidence of pulmonary ADEs compared with other ACEIs as well as ARBs (P < 0.0001) for group comparison (i.e., ACEIs vs. ARBs vs. quinapril vs. trandolapril) and (P &#8804; 0.0007) for pairwise comparison (i.e., ACEIs vs. quinapril, ACEIs vs. trandolapril, ARBs vs. quinapril, or ARBs vs. trandolapril). This study suggests that specific members of the ACEI antihypertensive class (quinapril and trandolapril) have a significantly higher cluster of pulmonary ADEs.","Jaberi-Douraki, Majid; Meyer, Emma; Riviere, Jim; Gedara, Nuwan Indika Millagaha; Kawakami, Jessica; Wyckoff, Gerald J; Xu, Xuan",Sci Rep,55,16

One key element in viral infection is the process of viral entry into the host cells. In the last two decades, there is increasing understanding on the importance of the endocytic pathway and the autophagy process in viral entry and replication. As a result, the endocytic pathway including endosome and lysosome has become important targets for development of therapeutic strategies in combating diseases caused by CoVs.

Obtaining voxel-level annotations for training segmentation networks is prohibitively expensive. Therefore we propose a weakly-supervised segmentation method based on dense regression activation maps (dRAM). Most advanced weakly supervised segmentation approaches exploit class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects generated from high-level semantic features at a coarse resolution. As a result, CAMs provide coarse outlines that do not align precisely with the object segmentations. Instead, we exploit dense features from a segmentation network to compute dense regression activation maps (dRAMs) for preserving local details. During training, dRAMs are pooled lobe-wise to regress the per-lobe lesion percentage. In such a way, the network achieves additional information regarding the lesion quantification in comparison with the classification approach. Furthermore, we refine dRAMs based on an attention module and dense conditional random field trained together with the main regression task. The refined dRAMs are served as the pseudo labels for training a final segmentation network. When evaluated on 69 CT scans, our method substantially improves the intersection over union from 0.335 in the CAM-based weakly supervised segmentation method to 0.495.","Xie, Weiyi; Jacobs, Colin; Ginneken, Bram van",,55,23

And companies that adapt their supply chains quickly to avoid costly production halts and secure the supply of important materials should have stronger relationships that result in both higher quality and lower long-run costs. Yet another possibility is that companies that temporarily redirect operations to provide needed products and services such as masks and ventilators could experience stronger customer and brand loyalty. Using multiple databases, regressions, matched sample analysis, and measures of media sentiment about particular companies, the authors report that companies exhibiting behavior perceived as strengthening their human capital and supply chain relationships, as well as a willingness to repurpose operations, experienced significantly less negative returns during the crisis. On the basis of this evidence, the authors conclude that a company's response towards its stakeholders can be important in preserving value, and propose that managements view their stakeholder investments as creating strategic resources, intangible assets whose value becomes most apparent during crises.","Cheema-Fox, Alex LaPerla Bridget R.; Wang, Hui Serafeim George",Journal of Applied Corporate Finance,55,26

A chest radiograph revealed pneumothorax and ground glass opacities. Ventilatory support with continuous positive airway pressure was needed. Given the respiratory failure and the positive test from the mother, the patient was sampled for SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR) at minute 30 of life, with a positive result reported at 36 h of life. No complications had been present during pregnancy, and cardiac screening and blood cultures revealed no other etiologies. CONCLUSION: Vertical transmission was highly likely in this case.

STUDY DESIGN: The study design was cross-sectional analyses of questionnaire data collected in April 2020. METHODS: Six hundred and thirty-five children who were FSM eligible with complete data were included in the analytic sample. Accessing a FSM was defined as receiving a FSM voucher or a cooked meal at school. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate (i) associations between characteristics and access to FSMs and (ii) associations between access to FSMs and household food insecurity measures. All analyses accounted for survey design and sample weights to ensure representativeness. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of eligible children accessed a FSM. Children in junior schools or above (aged 8+ years) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 11.81; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.54, 25.19), who belonged to low-income families (AOR: 4.81; 95% CI: 2.10, 11.03) or still attending schools (AOR: 5.87; 95% CI: 1.70, 20.25) were more likely to receive FSMs. Children in Wales were less likely to access FSMs than those in England (AOR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.43). Receiving a FSM was associated with increased odds of recently using a food bank but not reporting feeling hungry. CONCLUSIONS: In the month after the COVID-19 lockdown, 49% of eligible children did not receive any form of FSMs. The present analyses highlight that the voucher scheme did not adequately serve children who could not attend school during the lockdown. Moreover, more needs to be done to support families relying on income-related benefits, who still report needing to access a food bank. As the scheme may be continued in summer or in a potential second wave, large improvements will be needed to improve its reach.","Parnham, J C; Laverty, A A; Majeed, A; Vamos, E P",Public Health,55,4

By aligning science and diplomacy, countries can attract talent, strengthen their national research ecosystems, provide avenues for participation of scientists in policy, and coordinate integrated solutions to challenges with technical dimensions. While Latin America has a long tradition of bilateral and regional cooperation, science still plays a marginal role in foreign policy, as has become evidenced by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. With few exceptions, Latin American nations have a relatively immature science, technology, and innovation ecosystem, compounded by low public and private investments in research, coexisting with profound socio-economic inequalities, and large vulnerable populations. Such challenging conditions have created barriers to a fluid relationship between science and diplomacy, fundamentally characterized by inefficient communication between scientists and policymakers, weak collaboration channels, and duplicated roles, which altogether perpetuate siloed mentalities and a lack of trust between the two communities. Over the last decade, a first influential wave of Latin American scientists, diplomats, and other professionals, including five of the co-authors, have undertaken science diplomacy training provided by specialized organizations. Through these experiences, we recognized the need to elevate awareness and build capacities in science diplomacy in our respective countries and overall, across Latin America. Here, we describe emerging efforts and mechanisms to bridge the gap between scientists and policymakers at the national and regional level. Furthermore, we offer recommendations to amplify the impact of those pioneering initiatives toward consolidating a robust science diplomacy practice across the region. The national experiences described from Costa Rica, Mexico, and Panama can serve as a roadmap for other Latin American nations in the early process of developing a science diplomacy strategy, so they can also align themselves to a collective pathway. Most critically, we propose a way forward so that Latin America can leapfrog beyond disjointed training of individuals into integrated institutional strategies that can harness the tools of science diplomacy to enhance science-informed multilateral cooperation and enable more effective science-informed policymaking.","Lopez-Verges, S.; Macias-Navarro, L.; Hernandez-Mondragon, A.

COVID-19 is a global public health emergency of international concern. COVID-19 causes mild to severe illness with high morbidity and mortality, especially in preexisting risk groups. Therapeutic options are now limited to COVID-19. The hallmark of COVID-19 pathogenesis is the cytokine storm with elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1ß, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), chemokine (C-C-motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia, and neurological disorders, including stroke, the damage to the neurovascular unit, blood-brain barrier disruption, high intracranial proinflammatory cytokines, and endothelial cell damage in the brain. Mast cells are innate immune cells and also implicated in adaptive immune response, systemic inflammatory diseases, neuroinflammatory diseases, traumatic brain injury and stroke, and stress disorders. SARS-CoV-2 can activate monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, mast cells, neutrophils, and induce cytokine storm in the lung.

This poor clinical outcome is attributed to a lack of defined targets and patient-to-patient heterogeneity in target antigens and immune responses. To address such heterogeneity, we tested the efficacy of a personalized vaccination approach for the treatment of TNBC using the 4T1 murine TNBC model. We isolated tumor membrane vesicles (TMVs) from homogenized 4T1 tumor tissue and incorporated glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored forms of the immunostimulatory B7-1 (CD80) and IL-12 molecules onto these TMVs to make a TMV vaccine. Tumor-bearing mice were then administered with the TMV vaccine either alone or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We show that TMV-based vaccine immunotherapy in combination with anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment upregulated immunomodulatory cytokines in the plasma, significantly improved survival, and reduced pulmonary metastasis in mice compared to either therapy alone. The depletion of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, resulted in the loss of efficacy. This suggests that the vaccine acts via tumor-specific CD8+ T cell immunity. These results suggest TMV vaccine immunotherapy as a potential enhancer of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.","Pack, Christopher D; Bommireddy, Ramireddy; Munoz, Luis E; Patel, Jaina M; Bozeman, Erica N; Dey, Paulami; Radhakrishnan, Vijayaraghavan; Vartabedian, Vincent F; Venkat, Kalpana; Ramachandiran, Sampath; Reddy, Shaker J C; Selvaraj, Periasamy",Hum Vaccin Immunother,55,9

Household transmission is thought to contribute significantly to subsequent transmission through the broader community. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, contactless surveillance methods are of particular importance. METHODS: From November 2019 to April 2020, 303 households in the Seattle area were remotely monitored in a prospective longitudinal study for symptoms of respiratory viral illness. Enrolled participants reported weekly symptoms and submitted respiratory samples by mail in the event of an acute respiratory illness (ARI). Specimens were tested for fourteen viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, using RT-PCR. Participants completed all study procedures at home without physical contact with research staff. RESULTS: In total, 1171 unique participants in 303 households were monitored for ARI.

Both types of materials (nanopowders and nanofilms scratched off of the working electrode’s surface) have been characterized in detail by XRD, TEM, and Raman techniques. Inserting dopant ions into the TiO2 structure has resulted in inhibition of crystal growth and prevention of phase transformation. The role of Zr4+ ions in this process was explained by performing computer simulations. The three structures such as pure anatase, Zr-doped TiO2, and tetragonal ZrO2 have been investigated using density functional theory extended by Hubbard correction. The computational calculations correlate well with experimental results. Formation of defects and broadening of energy bandgap in defected Zr-doped materials have been confirmed. It turned out that the oxygen vacancies with substituting Zr4+ ions in TiO2 structure have a positive influence on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells. The overall photoconversion efficiency enhancement up to 8.63% by introducing 3.7% Zr4+ ions into the TiO2 has been confirmed by I-V curves, EIS, and IPCE measurements.

Here, we retrospectively described the dynamic changes of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG specifically against SARS-CoV-2 in later weeks (mainly 4-10 weeks) in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We observed that serum IgM and IgG, especially in patients with moderate-to-high levels, declined significantly between week 4 to 10 after illness onset. Notably, IgG levels in high percentage of patients (77.5%, 31 of 40) rapidly declined by half, from 212.5 (range, 163.7-420.3) to 96.3 (range, 75.0-133.4) AU/mL, within 1 to 2 weeks in the second month and then sustained at around 100 AU/mL until discharge from hospital. Significant reduction of IgM was also observed as SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid turned negative (P = .002). In the recovery stage, serum IgG declined significantly (early vs late recovery stage, n = 16, P = .003) with a median reduction of 50.0% (range, 3.7%-77.0%). Our results suggested that the decline of IgM may be an indicator of virus clearance and recovered patients may have a robust immunity against reinfection within at least 3 months after illness onset. Yet, the rapid reduction of IgG by half rises serious concerns on the robustness and sustainability of the humoral immune response in the period after discharge, which is crucial for immunity strategy and developing a vaccine.","Zhou, Wei; Xu, Xiaomao; Chang, Zhigang; Wang, He; Zhong, Xuefeng; Tong, Xunliang; Liu, Taotao; Li, Yanming",J Med Virol,55,20

One such drug, tranilast, is currently being evaluated as a COVID-19 treatment target in a clinical trial. In this study, we present a single-cell mathematical model that captures the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, pyroptotic cell death and drug-responses to tranilast. The model is formulated in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the dynamics of proteins involved in pyroptosis. The model demonstrates that tranilast delays the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and thus may alter the mode of cell death from inflammatory (pyroptosis) to non-inflammatory (e.g., apoptosis).","Hamis, Sara J; Macfarlane, Fiona R",,55,22

Ligation reagents can be difficult to obtain in countries like Bolivia. Thus, here we provide an alternative for library preparation using the rapid PCR barcoding kit (ONT). We mapped more than 3.9 million sequence reads that allowed us to sequence twelve SARS-CoV-2 genomes from three different Bolivian cities. The average sequencing depth was 324X and the average genome length was 29527 bp. Thus, we could cover in average a 98,7% of the reference genome. The twelve genomes were successfully assigned to four different nextstrain clades (20A, 20B, 20E and 20G) and we could observe two main lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Bolivia. Therefore, this alternative library preparation for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing is effective to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants with high accuracy and without the need of DNA ligation. Hence, providing another tool to perform SARS-CoV-2 genome surveillance in developing countries.","Rollano-Penaloza, Oscar M.; Delgado, Carmen; Vasquez, Aneth",,55,3

The resulting lung lesions compromise patient pulmonary function and increase mortality, or end in permanent lung damage for those who have recovered from the COVID-19 disease. Therefore, local pulmonary fibrinolysis can be efficacious in degrading pre-existing fibrin clots and reducing the conversion of lung lesions into lasting scars. Plasminogen is considered a key player in fibrinolysis processes, and in view of a bench-to-bedside translation, we focused on the aerosolization of an orphan medicinal product (OMP) for ligneous conjunctivitis: human plasminogen (PLG-OMP) eye drops. As such, the sterile and preservative-free solution guarantees the pharmaceutical quality of GMP production and meets the Ph. Eur. requirements of liquid preparations for nebulization. PLG-OMP aerosolization was evaluated both from technological and stability viewpoints, after being submitted to either jet or ultrasonic nebulization. Jet nebulization resulted in a more efficient delivery of an aerosol suitable for pulmonary deposition. The biochemical investigation highlighted substantial protein integrity maintenance with the percentage of native plasminogen band > 90%, in accordance with the quality specifications of PLG-OMP. In a coherent way, the specific activity of plasminogen is maintained within the range 4.8-5.6 IU/mg (PLG-OMP pre-nebulization: 5.0 IU/mg). This is the first study that focuses on the technological and biochemical aspects of aerosolized plasminogen, which could affect both treatment efficacy and clinical dosage delivery. Increasing evidence for the need of local fibrinolytic therapy could merge with the availability of PLG-OMP as an easy handling solution, readily aerosolizable for a fast translation into an extended clinical efficacy assessment in COVID-19 patients.","Piras, Anna Maria; Zambito, Ylenia; Lugli, Maurizio; Ferro, Baldassare; Roncucci, Paolo; Mori, Filippo; Salvatore, Alfonso; Ascione, Ester; Bellini, Marta; Crea, Roberto",,55,32

Hence, the vaccine development and clinical trials are carried on in an accelerated rate. At that, success of any mass immunization program, including its global application, directly depends on population willingness to be vaccinated. The purpose of the study is to investigate opinions about COVID-19 vaccination in various countries and to identify factors contributing to or hindering to increasing commitment to immunization. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The search of relevant data was implemented through such bibliographic databases as eLIBRARY.RU, PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus and Google Scholar. Moreover, the primary research data concerning opinions of Russians about coronavirus infection vaccination was analyzed. RESULTS: The cross-country study of opinions about COVID-19 vaccination permitted to identify main factors impacting degree of readiness to mass immunization, including fear and personal perceptions of risk of COVID-19 infection, attitudes to influenza vaccination and fear of vaccination, mainly due to disinformation about efficiency, efficacy and safety of the vaccine. CONCLUSION: The conclusion was made that public opinion surveys implemented in various countries are important because they provide priceless information for implementing public policy targeted to improve health care support, in particular to develop effective vaccination campaigns against COVID-19, identifying high-risk groups, socially and economically vulnerable individuals for whom vaccination is to be paramount and free, and also setting vaccination fees for other groups based on their readiness to pay.","Vosheva, N A; Kamynina, N N; Korotkova, E O; Voshev, D V",Probl Sotsialnoi Gig Zdravookhranenniiai Istor Med,55,6

It is essential to also understand generational differences in psychosocial impacts to identify appropriate prevention and intervention targets. Across generational groups, this study examined: (1) rates of precautions and adaptive and maladaptive health behaviors, (2) differences in levels of anxiety, and (3) rates of COVID-related concerns during Wave 1 of COVID-19 in Canada. PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data from 2 Canadian population-based data sets: the Canadian Perspective Survey Series: Impact of COVID-19 survey (N = 4,627; March 29 to April 3, 2020), and Crowdsourcing: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians-Your Mental Health (N = 45,989; April 24 to May 11, 2020). MEASURES: We categorized generational age group. Participants self-reported changes in behaviors and COVID-related concerns, and a validated measure assessed anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: There are generational differences in behavioral responses to the pandemic. Adaptive health habits (e.g., exercise) were comparable across groups, while changes in maladaptive health habits (e.g., substance use) were highest among younger age groups, particularly Millennials (15 to 34 years old). COVID-related precautions were also highest among the younger generations, with Generation X (35 to 54 years old) exhibiting the highest rate of precautionary behavior. Results also revealed that the highest rate of clinically significant anxiety is among Millennials (36.0%; severe anxiety = 15.7%), and the younger generations have the highest rates of COVID-related concerns. CONCLUSION: These early data are essential in understanding at-risk groups given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and its potential long-term implications.","El-Gabalawy, Renée; Sommer, Jordana L",Can J Psychiatry,55,6

While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive, â¼30kb SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyze the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in-silico pipeline to predict regions of high base pair content across long genomes and to pinpoint hotspots of well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity for stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of HCV, one of the most structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis suggests varying levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural ORFs containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we take a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts, which given the technical difficulty of experimentally separating cellular mixtures of sgRNA from gRNA, is a unique advantage of our in-silico pipeline. The resulting findings provide a useful roadmap for planning focused empirical studies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA biology, and a preliminary guide for exploring potential SARS-CoV-2 RNA drug targets.Importance The RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 is among the largest and most complex viral genomes, and yet its RNA structural features remain relatively unexplored. Since RNA elements guide function in most RNA viruses, and they represent potential drug targets, it is essential to chart the architectural features of SARS-CoV-2 and pinpoint regions that merit focused study. Here we show that RNA folding stability of SARS-CoV-2 genome is exceptional among viral genomes and we develop a method to directly compare levels of predicted secondary structure across SARS-CoV-2 domains. Remarkably, we find that coding regions display the highest structural propensity in the genome, forming motifs that differ between the genomic and subgenomic contexts. Our approach provides an attractive strategy to rapidly screen for candidate structured regions based on base pairing potential and provides a readily interpretable roadmap to guide functional studies of RNA viruses and other pharmacologically relevant RNA transcripts.","Tavares, Rafael de Cesaris Araujo; Mahadeshwar, Gandhar; Wan, Han; Huston, Nicholas C; Pyle, Anna Marie",J. virol,55,26

The vast majority of women attend prenatal care, which is a unique source of population-based blood samples appropriate for validation studies. We used stored 2018 serum samples from an existing pregnancy cohort study to evaluate the specificity of COVID-19 serologic rapid diagnostic tests. METHODS: We randomly selected 120 stored serum samples from pregnant women enrolled in a cohort in 2018 in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, at least 1 year before the COVID-19 pandemic. We used stored serum to evaluate four lateral flow rapid diagnostic tests, following manufacturers' instructions. Pictures were taken for all tests and read by two blinded trained evaluators. RESULTS: We evaluated 120, 80, 90, and 90 samples, respectively. Specificity for both IgM and IgG was 100% for the first two tests (95% confidence intervals [CI] 97.0-100 and 95.5-100, respectively). The third test had a specificity of 98.9% (95% CI 94.0-100) for IgM and 94.4% (95% CI 87.5-98.2) for IgG. The fourth test had a specificity of 88.9% (95% CI 80.5-94.5) for IgM and 100% (95% CI 96.0-100) for IgG. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 serologic rapid tests are of variable specificity.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to utilize a large, nationally representative dataset of critically ill adults with COVID-19 to determine which factors explain mortality variability. METHODS: In this multicenter cohort study, we examined adults hospitalized in intensive care units with COVID-19 at 70 United States hospitals between March and June 2020. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We examined patient-level and hospital-level variables. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with interhospital variation. The median odds ratio (OR) was calculated to compare outcomes in higher- vs. lower-mortality hospitals. A gradient boosted machine algorithm was developed for individual-level mortality models. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 4,019 patients were included, 1537 (38%) of whom died by 28 days. Mortality varied considerably across hospitals (0-82%). After adjustment for patient- and hospital-level domains, interhospital variation was attenuated (OR decline from 2.06 [95% CI, 1.73-2.37] to 1.22 [95% CI, 1.00-1.38]), with the greatest changes occurring with adjustment for acute physiology, socioeconomic status, and strain. For individual patients, the relative contribution of each domain to mortality risk was: acute physiology (49%), demographics and comorbidities (20%), socioeconomic status (12%), strain (9%), hospital quality (8%), and treatments (3%). CONCLUSION: There is considerable interhospital variation in mortality for critically ill patients with COVID-19, which is mostly explained by hospital-level socioeconomic status, strain, and acute physiologic differences. Individual mortality is driven mostly by patient-level factors.

An umbrella and mapping review with meta-meta-analysis (MMA) of the available scientific evidence was performed to determine if telerehabilitation could be an effective alternative to conventional rehabilitation in physical therapist practice. METHODS: A systematic review of reviews and a synthesis of the findings of all systematic evidence published to date with a visual map and a meta-meta-analysis (MMA) were performed. A systematic search was realized in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), MEDLINE (PubMed), and Google Scholar. Two independent reviewers performed a data analysis and assessed the quality of the included reviews, assessing the risk of bias using ROBIS. RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles that met the inclusion criteria were selected and divided according to the type of patient targeted for rehabilitation (patients with cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and neurological conditions). The MMA regarding physical function between telerehabilitation and usual care rehabilitation did not reveal a statistically significant difference for patients with cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal conditions. For patients with neurological conditions, the MMA revealed a statistically significant but negligible effect size in 6 reviews in favor of telerehabilitation (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.03-0.34). CONCLUSION: The results of the present review showed that telerehabilitation offers positive clinical results, even comparable to conventional face-to-face rehabilitation approaches. IMPACT: The advantages of lower cost and less interference by the rehabilitation processes in patients' daily life could justify implementing telerehabilitation in clinical settings in the COVID-19 era.","Suso-Martí, Luis; La Touche, Roy; Herranz-Gómez, Aida; Angulo-Díaz-Parreño, Santiago; Paris-Alemany, Alba; Cuenca-Martínez, Ferran",Phys. ther,55,1

Fewer pretreatment steps correspond to lower chances of infection. The authors established a direct injection technique to analyze levetiracetam (LEV) concentrations in human serum and studied its application in therapeutic drug monitoring. METHODS: Serum samples were prepared by hollow fiber centrifugal ultrafiltration and the filtrate was directly injected into a UHPLC apparatus (Waters UPLC BEH C18 column: 50 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm) for analysis. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water (8:92) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 30°C. The detected wavelength was 210 nm. RESULTS: A linear relationship was obtained for LEV from 0.625 to 80 µg/mL (r = 0.999). The limit of detection (LOD) for the analysis of LEV was 0.125 µg/mL. The analysis time was shortened to 4 min. The recovery rate of LEV based on the current method was 96.6-100.1%, whereas the absolute recovery rate was 93.2-96.8%. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of intraday and interday precision was <7.3%. Stability was achieved at room temperature for 24 hr after 3 freeze-thaw cycles and at -80 °C for 21 days. The method was successfully applied to determine LEV concentrations in the serum of 19 patients. CONCLUSION: The present method is simple, accurate, and sensitive and can improve biosafety with the direct injection technique. It is suitable for the analysis of LEV concentrations in therapeutic drug monitoring.","Dong, Wei-Chong; Guo, Jia-Liang; Yang, Xiu-Ling; Wang, Shu-Mei; Yuan, Ye; Zhao, Meng-Qiang; Jiang, Ye; Zhang, Zhi-Qing",Ther. drug monit,55,1

The development of ARDS has been reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to determine whether serum KL-6 levels are associated with mortality and severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Among 361 Japanese patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Kanagawa Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center between February 2020 and December 2020, 356 patients with data on serum KL-6 levels were enrolled and their medical records were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A negative correlation was observed between KL-6 levels and the ratio of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen on admission. The KL-6 levels on admission and the maximal KL-6 levels were higher in patients with severe disease (n = 60) than in those with nonsevere disease (n = 296). Furthermore, the maximal KL-6 levels were higher in nonsurvivors (n = 6) than in survivors (n = 350). In nonsurvivors, the KL-6 levels increased as the disease progressed. The optimal cutoff value of the maximal KL-6 level for discriminating between survivors and nonsurvivors was 684 U/mL, with a sensitivity of 83.3%, a specificity of 90.5%, and an area under the curve of 0.89.

However, physical activity has globally decreased since the beginning of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak because of social distancing measures. Older adults and people with age-related diseases (e.g., diabetes, obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disorders, etc.) are widely affected by COVID-19 and its grave adverse effects because of their baseline poor immune function. Although they are in intense need for the therapeutic benefits of exercise, they may express a low capacity for exercising due to skeletal muscle dysfunction and low motivation. Honey is a natural energy-rich, low glycemic index food with a variety of biological activities. It is reported to correct muscle pathology in diseased conditions. Because skeletal muscle is the key structure involved in exercise, we explored the literature for the exercise-promoting potential of natural honey. Bee honey improves physical performance at moderate levels of activity, and it reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers of fatigue following strenuous exercise among athletes. Supplementing ischemic heart disease patients with honey combined with floral pollen improved patients' tolerance for physical loads and corrected metabolism. Therefore, the therapeutic use of honey may have implications for to increasing the capacity for exercise in aged and diseased individuals.

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 48 patients with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 infection who had undergone CT-PE between March 23 and April 6, 2020, in a large urban health care system were included. Patient demographics and clinical data were collected through the electronic medical record system. Twenty-five patients underwent dual-energy CT (DECT) as part of the standard CT-PE protocol at a subset of the hospitals. Two thoracic radiologists independently assessed all studies. Disagreement in assessment was resolved by consensus discussion with a third thoracic radiologist. Results: Of the 48 patients, 45 patients required admission, with 18 admitted to the intensive care unit, and 13 requiring intubation. Seven patients (15%) were found to have pulmonary emboli. Dilated vessels were seen in 41 cases (85%), with 38 (78%) and 27 (55%) cases demonstrating vessel enlargement within and outside of lung opacities, respectively. Dilated distal vessels extending to the pleura and fissures were seen in 40 cases (82%) and 30 cases (61%), respectively. At DECT, mosaic perfusion pattern was observed in 24 cases (96%), regional hyperemia overlapping with areas of pulmonary opacities or immediately surrounding the opacities were seen in 13 cases (52%), opacities associated with corresponding oligemia were seen in 24 cases (96%), and hyperemic halo was seen in 9 cases (36%). Conclusion: Pulmonary vascular abnormalities such as vessel enlargement and regional mosaic perfusion patterns are common in COVID-19 pneumonia. Perfusion abnormalities are also frequently observed at DECT in COVID-19 pneumonia and may suggest an underlying vascular process.

METHOD: An overview of existing research and evaluation approaches along with expert perspectives drawn from the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Working Group on Technology Assessment and Quality Development in Health Informatics and the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) Working Group for Assessment of Health Information Systems. RESULTS: Evaluation of digital health technologies for COVID-19 should be based on their technical maturity as well as the scale of implementation. For mature technologies like telehealth whose efficacy has been previously demonstrated, pragmatic, rapid evaluation using the complex systems paradigm which accounts for multiple sociotechnical factors, might be more suitable to examine their effectiveness and emerging safety concerns in new settings. New technologies, particularly those intended for use on a large scale such as digital contract tracing, will require assessment of their usability as well as performance prior to deployment, after which evaluation should shift to using a complex systems paradigm to examine the value of information provided. The success of a digital health technology is dependent on the value of information it provides relative to the sociotechnical context of the setting where it is implemented. CONCLUSION: Commitment to evaluation using the evidence-based medicine and complex systems paradigms will be critical to ensuring safe and effective use of digital health technologies for COVID-19 and future pandemics.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional convenience sample. SETTING: Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1684 Australians aged 18-65 years who drink at least monthly. MEASUREMENTS: Items from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the stress subscale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). FINDINGS: Overall, harmful drinking decreased during social distancing measures in our sample [2019 score = 8.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 7.9-8.4; during the pandemic = 7.3, 95% CI = 7.1-7.6]. Younger drinkers, particularly young women, decreased their consumption the most, but there was a small increase in consumption in middle-aged women. Drinkers experiencing high levels of stress also reported a relatively higher shift in harmful consumption compared with those with low levels of stress (ß = 0.65, P = 0.003), despite reporting a small decrease overall. CONCLUSIONS: The closure of licensed premises and social distancing measures in Australia in response to the COVID-19 outbreak appear to have reduced harmful alcohol consumption in younger drinkers, particularly young women.","Callinan, Sarah; Smit, Koen; Mojica-Perez, Yvette; D039,; Aquino, Simon; Moore, David; Kuntsche, Emmanuel",Addiction,55,27

We compared corticospinal excitability and motor representation assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) between long-term resistance trained (LRT, &#8805;3 years) vs untrained (UNT) males (n=15/group). Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were obtained from the biceps brachii during isometric elbow flexion. Stimulus-response curves were created at the hotspot during 10% maximum voluntary torque (MVT) contractions. Maximum peak-to-peak MEP amplitude (MEPmax) was acquired with 100% stimulator output intensity whilst 25-100% MVT was produced. Maps were created during 10% MVT contractions, with an individualised TMS intensity eliciting 20% MEPmax at the hotspot. LRT had a 48% lower stimulus-response curve slope than UNT (P<0.05). LRT also had a 66% larger absolute map size, although TMS intensity used for mapping was greater in LRT vs UNT (48% vs 26% above active motor threshold) to achieve a target 20% MEPmax at the hotspot, due to the lower slope of LRT. Map size was strongly correlated with the TMS intensity used for mapping (r=0.776, P<0.001). Once map size was normalised to TMS intensity, there was no difference between the groups (P=0.683). We conclude that LRT had a lower stimulus-response curve slope/excitability, suggesting higher neural efficiency. TMS map size was overwhelmingly determined by TMS intensity, even when the MEP response at the hotspot was matched among individuals, likely due to larger current spread with higher intensities. Motor representation appears similar between LRT and UNT given no difference in the normalised map size.","Maeo, Sumiaki; Balshaw, Thomas G; Lanza, Marcel B; Hannah, Ricci; Folland, Jonathan P",Eur. j. neurosci,55,2

The study aimed to identify therapeutic approaches and drugs that can potentially be used as interventions in Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) management. A systematic scoping review was conducted. Articles reporting clinical evidence of therapeutic management of COVID-19 were selected from three different research databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct). From the database search, 31 articles were selected based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. This review paper showed that remdesivir and ivermectin significantly reduced viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) activity. On the other hand, convalescent plasma (CP) significantly improved COVID-19 clinical symptoms. Additionally, the use of corticosteroid increased survival rates in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Findings also indicated that both hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir were effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, lopinavir-ritonavir combination was not effective against COVID-19. Finally, ribavirin, galidesivir, and sofosbuvir showed potential therapeutic benefit in treating COVID-19, but there is a lack of clinical evidence on their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: Data were collected from a large sample of the Norwegian population (n = 4008) through the Norwegian Citizen Panel (NCP). A linear regression was conducted to examine the effects of COVID-19 related risk factors on psychological distress, using the 10-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-10). Finally, we conducted a moderation analysis to examine the interaction of trust in the healthcare system and COVID-19 related risk factors. RESULTS: A linear regression showed that female gender, younger age, lower level of education, being infected with COVID-19, being medically vulnerable, working in the healthcare system, being in voluntary quarantine and having an immigrant background predicted mean HSCL-10 scores. The moderation analysis revealed that people in the medically vulnerable group, those below 61, and those in quarantine reported higher psychological distress when they also had lower trust in the healthcare system. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate important groups to take into consideration in mental healthcare strategies and policies.

The purpose of this study is to assess patient satisfaction and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for individuals who underwent follow-up for shoulder surgery using telemedicine compared to those who received traditional in-person clinic follow-up. METHODS: Patients who underwent either rotator cuff repair or total shoulder arthroplasty during a designated pre-COVID-19 (traditional clinic follow-up) or peri-COVID-19 (telemedicine follow-up) span of time were identified. PROMs including the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons standardized assessment form, the three-level version of the EQ-5D form, the 12-Item Short Form survey, and a modified version of a published telemedicine survey were administered to participants six months post-operatively via phone call. RESULTS: Sixty patients agreed to participate. There was no significant difference between the pre-COVID-19 and peri-COVID-19 groups in patient satisfaction with their follow-up visit (p = 0.289), nor was there a significant difference in PROMs between the two groups. In total, 83.33% of the telemedicine group and 70.37% of the in-person clinic group preferred traditional in-person follow-up over telemedicine. DISCUSSION: In a cohort of patients who underwent telemedicine follow-up for shoulder surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no difference in patient satisfaction and PROMs compared to traditional in-person clinic follow-up. This study indicates that while the majority of participants preferred face-to-face visits, patients were relatively satisfied with their care and had similar functional outcome scores in both groups, despite the large disruption in healthcare logistics caused by COVID-19.","Sabbagh, Ramsey; Shah, Nihar; Jenkins, Sarah; Macdonald, Jacob; Foote, Austin; Matar, Robert; Steffensmeier, Andrew; Grawe, Brian",J Telemed Telecare,55,24

In this study, various alternative (mostly common household) materials, which have not traditionally been used in respiratory protective devices, were tested for particle filtration performance and breathability. Most of these materials were found of some-but rather limited-utility in facemasks. At a breathing flow rate of 30 L min-1, 17 out of 19 tested materials demonstrated collection efficiency below 50%; at 85 L min-1, only one material featured particle collection efficiency above 50%. Pressure drop values were mostly below 4 mm w.g. (observed in 89% of cases for the two flow rates), which provides comfortable breathing. Only for one fabric material (silk) tested at 85 L min-1 did the pressure drop reach 11 mm w.g. Based on these results, a three-layer facemask prototype was designed and fabricated comprised of the best performing materials. Additional tests were conducted to examine possible particle detachment/shedding from the materials used in the newly developed facemask, but no such phenomenon was observed. The prototype was evaluated on 10 human subjects using the standard OSHA-approved quantitative fit testing protocol. The mask protection level, determined as an adopted fit factor, was found to lie between that of the two commercial surgical/medical masks tested for comparison. A 10-cycle washing of the mask prototype lowered its collection efficiency across the particle size range; however, washing did not substantially affect mask breathability. The study revealed that although homemade masks offer a certain level of protection to a wearer, one should not expect them to provide the same respiratory protection as high-end commercial surgical/medical masks or-by any means-NIOSH-certified N95 filtering facepieces.","Reutman, Susan R; Reponen, Tiina; Yermakov, Michel; A Grinshpun, Sergey",J Occup Environ Hyg,55,23

In this manuscript, we provide algorithmic answers to the following two inter-related public health challenges. (1) Inference Challenge: assuming that there are $N$ census blocks (nodes) in the city, and given an initial infection at any set of nodes, what is the probability for a subset of census blocks to become infected by the time the spread of the infection burst is stabilized? (2) Prevention Challenge: What is the minimal control action one can take to minimize the infected part of the stabilized state footprint? To answer the challenges, we build a Graphical Model of pandemic of the attractive Ising (pair-wise, binary) type, where each node represents a census track and each edge factor represents the strength of the pairwise interaction between a pair of nodes. We show that almost all attractive Ising Models on dense graphs result in either of the two modes for the most probable state: either all nodes which were not infected initially became infected, or all the initially uninfected nodes remain uninfected. This bi-modal solution of the Inference Challenge allows us to re-state the Prevention Challenge as the following tractable convex programming: for the bare Ising Model with pair-wise and bias factors representing the system without prevention measures, such that the MAP state is fully infected for at least one of the initial infection patterns, find the closest, in $l_1$ norm, set of factors resulting in all the MAP states of the Ising model, with the optimal prevention measures applied, to become safe.","Krechetov, Mikhail; Sikaroudi, Amir Mohammad Esmaieeli; Efrat, Alon; Polishchuk, Valentin; Chertkov, Michael",,55,1

More importantly, we found that SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers were stable or even increased within the observation period, which contradicts earlier studies reporting a rapid waning of Ab titers after three to four months. Moreover, we observed a positive correlation of neutralization titers with increasing age, number of symptoms reported, and the presence of the Rhesus Ag RhD. Validation of the platforms revealed that highest assay performances were obtained with the wild-type virus and the surrogate neutralization platforms. However, our data also suggested that selection of cutoff titers had a strong impact on the evaluation of neutralization potency. When taking strong neutralization potency, as demonstrated by the wild-type virus platform as the gold standard, up to 55% of plasma products had low neutralization titers. However, a significant portion of these products were overrated in their potency when using the surrogate assay with the recommended cutoff titer. In summary, our study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers are stable for at least seven months after diagnosis and offers a testing strategy for rapid selection of high-titer convalescent plasma products in a biosafety level 1 environment.","Jahrsdörfer, Bernd; Groß, Rüdiger; Seidel, Alina; Wettstein, Lukas; Ludwig, Carolin; Schwarz, Tatjana; Körper, Sixten; Rojewski, Markus; Lotfi, Ramin; Weinstock, Christoph; Seifried, Erhard; Corman, Victor Max; Drosten, Christian; Münch, Jan; Schrezenmeier, Hubert",J Immunol,55,6
336307,336307,336307,Institutional betrayal in nursing: A concept analysis,15.02559,3.5634687,2021,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is a major public health issue. More than one out of five women treated for breast cancer will develop lymphedema in an upper extremity. Current evidence advocates transdisciplinary oncological rehabilitation. Therefore, research in this area is necessary since limited consensus having been reached with regard to the basic essential components of this rehabilitation. Consensus has, however, been reached on the use of decongestive lymphedema therapy (DLT), but due to a lack of tests, the necessary dosages are unknown and its level is moderately strong. This study attempts to verify both the efficacy of activity-oriented proprioceptive antiedema therapy (TAPA), as compared to conventional treatments such as DLT or Complex Physical Therapy (CPT), as well as its efficiency in terms of cost-effectiveness, for patients affected by breast cancer-related arm lymphedema. METHODS: Controlled, randomized clinical trial with dual stratification, two parallel arms, longitudinal and single blind. 64 women with breast cancer-related arm lymphedema will take part in the study. The experimental group intervention will be the same for stage I and II, and will consist of neuro-dynamic exercises oriented to the activity, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation activities and proprioceptive anti-edema bandaging. The control group intervention, depending on the stage, will consist of preventive measures, skin care and exercise-prescribed training in the lymphedema workshop as well as compression garments (Stage I) or conservative Complex Decongestive Therapy treatment (skin care, multi-layer bandaging, manual lymphatic drainage and massage therapy) (Stage II). RESULTS: Sociodemographic and clinical variables will be collected for the measurement of edema volume and ADL performance. Statistical analysis will be performed on intent to treat. DISCUSSION: It has been recommended that patient training be added to DLT, as well as a re-designing of patient lifestyles and the promotion of health-related aspects. In addition, clinical trials should be undertaken to assess neural mobilization techniques and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation should be included in the therapy. Cohesive bandaging will also be performed as an early form of pressotherapy. The proposed study combines all of these aspects in order to increased comfort and promote the participation of individuals with lymphedema in everyday situations. LIMITATIONS: The authors have proposed the assessment of the experimental treatment for stages I and II. One possible limitation is the lack of awareness of whether or not this treatment would be effective for other stages as well as the concern for proper hand cleansing during use of bandages, given the current COVID-19 pandemic situation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT03762044 ). Date of registration: 23 November 2018.

A literature review identified that staff wellbeing and resilience initiatives contribute to increased job satisfaction and decreased turnover. Objective: To help health care providers become resilient by addressing self-care needs and increasing compassion satisfaction during COVID-19 utilizing integrative modalities. Methods: The Resilient Provider program was developed, consisting of seven, one-hour virtual sessions. Sessions were interprofessional and covered resiliency, yoga, mindfulness, nutrition, caring touch, aromatherapy, qi, and acupressure. All sessions were interactive, with experiential components. Attendees were provided with simple but effective exercises that could be completed in less than 5minutes. Sessions were recorded and loaded into a virtual library to provide ongoing support to staff experiencing increased stress. Results: 103 providers completed all 7 sessions. Outcomes were measured using the Professional Quality of Life scale with the aim to increase compassion satisfaction and decrease burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Participants were sent the survey prior to the first session, as well as at the 30 and 90 day post-session mark. Compassion satisfaction remained high and burnout and secondary traumatic stress remained consistent, suggesting that the skills learned were helpful during the increased stress of COVID-19. Data from session evaluations shows that 96% (n=103) of participants named one new skill they would implement. 53 sessions have been watched in the online library.

Specifically, are they likely to have improved public health understood according to widely used aggregate population health measures, such as Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) as much or more than alternatives? This is a reasonable question, since such measures have been promoted extensively in global and national health policy by influential actors, and they have become almost synonymous with quantification of public health. If the steps taken against COVID-19 did not meet this test, then either the measures or the policies must be re-evaluated. There are indications that policies against COVID-19 may have been unbalanced and therefore not optimal. A balanced approach to protecting population health should be proportionate in its effects across distinct health concerns at a moment, across populations over time and across populations over space. These criteria provide a guide to designing and implementing policies that diminish harm from COVID-19 while also providing due attention to other threats to aggregate population health. They should shape future policies in response to this pandemic and others.","Reddy, Sanjay G",,55,24

Lombardy was the first Italian region to be affected by the pandemic. Subsequently, the entire Northern part of Italy recorded a high number of cases, while the South was hit following the migratory waves. On March 8th, the Italian Government has issued a decree that imposed a total lockdown defined as a state of isolation and restricted access in Lombardy and in the other 14 provinces of Northern Italy. METHODS: We analyzed the virus trend in the period between February 24th and September 8th, 2020, focusing on Calabria, with regards to the following items: new positives, change of total positives and total cases. Furthermore, we included other information, such as the incubation period, symptom resolution period, quarantine period. RESULTS: On March 27th, the epidemic curve spiked with 101 new positive cases validating the hypothesis that this abnormal event was related to the displacement of non-residents people, living in the Northern part of Italy, to the home regions in the South. The epidemic curve showed a decreasing trend in the period after lockdown proving the effectiveness of this measure. From the end of the lockdown (May 04th) to September 8th, the registered trend was -94.51%. A negative growth rate indicates that the number of new positive cases is lower than the number of healed patients. CONCLUSION: This study describes the effectiveness of the Italian Government policy, particularly the role of lockdown, for the containment of SARS-CoV-2 contagion in Calabria, a region with a low SARS-CoV-2 infection rate within the registered period.","Abenavoli, Ludovico; Cinaglia, Pietro; Procopio, Anna Caterina; Serra, Raffaele; Aquila, Isabella; Zanza, Christian; Longhitano, Yaroslava; Artico, Marco; Larussa, Tiziana; Boccuto, Luigi; Ricci, Pietrantonio; Luzza, Francesco",Reviews on recent clinical trials (Online),55,1

Little is known about the effects of a pandemic on non-elective neurosurgical practices, which have continued under modified conditions to reduce the spread of COVID-19. This knowledge might be critical for the ongoing second coronavirus wave and potential restrictions on health care. We aimed to determine the incidence and 30-day mortality rate of various non-elective neurosurgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. A retrospective, multi-centre observational cohort study among neurosurgical centres within Austria, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland was performed. Incidence of neurosurgical emergencies and related 30-day mortality rates were determined for a period reflecting the peak pandemic of the first wave in all participating countries (i.e. March 16th-April 15th, 2020), and compared to the same period in prior years (2017, 2018, and 2019). A total of 4,752 emergency neurosurgical cases were reviewed over a 4-year period. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a general decline in the incidence of non-elective neurosurgical cases, which was driven by a reduced number of traumatic brain injuries, spine conditions, and chronic subdural hematomas. Thirty-day mortality did not significantly increase overall or for any of the conditions examined during the peak of the pandemic. The neurosurgical community in these three European countries observed a decrease in the incidence of some neurosurgical emergencies with 30-day mortality rates comparable to previous years (2017-2019). Lower incidence of neurosurgical cases is likely related to restrictions placed on mobility within countries, but may also involve delayed patient presentation.","Grassner, Lukas; Petr, Ondra; Warner, Freda M; Dedeciusova, Michaela; Mathis, Andrea Maria; Pinggera, Daniel; Gsellmann, Sina; Meiners, Laura C; Freigang, Sascha; Mokry, Michael; Resch, Alexandra; Kretschmer, Thomas; Rossmann, Tobias; Navarro, Francisco Ruiz; Gruber, Andreas; Spendel, Mathias; Winkler, Peter A; Marhold, Franz; Sherif, Camillo; Wais, Jonathan P; Rössler, Karl; Pfisterer, Wolfgang; Mühlbauer, Manfred; Trivik-Barrientos, Felipe A; Rath, Sebastian; Voldrich, Richard; Krska, Lukas; Lipina, Radim; Kerekanic, Martin; Fiedler, Jiri; Kasik, Petr; Priban, Vladimir; Tichy, Michal; Krupa, Petr; Cesak, Tomas; Kroupa, Robert; Callo, Andrej; Haninec, Pavel; Pohlodek, Daniel; Krahulik, David; Sejkorova, Alena; Sames, Martin; Dvorak, Josef; Suchomel, Petr; Tomas, Robert; Klener, Jan; Juran, Vilem; Smrcka, Martin; Linzer, Petr; Kaiser, Miroslav",Sci Rep,55,16

METHODS: We extracted publicly available data from various official websites, summarized the strategies implemented in these four countries, and assessed the effectiveness of the prevention and control measures adopted by these countries. RESULTS: As of October 28, 2020, the growth of daily new confirmed cases has stabilized in China, Singapore, and South Korea. In Japan, the daily new confirmed cases increased sharply since it lifted a state of emergency, but case-fatality maintains at a lower level. The growth of total cases is near stagnant in China and Singapore, with a case-fatality of 5.39 and 0.05% respectively. The case-fatality rate between Japan and South Korea is identical at 1.76%, however, Japan's growth rate of cases has increased more rapidly than South Korea. CONCLUSION: This study found that China, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea accessed the situation within their own borders and implemented different intervention strategies to curb the spread of COVID-19 and maintain lower rates of case-fatality. China, Singapore, and South Korea adopted the containment strategy, while Japan adopted the mitigation strategy. Although Japan's case-fatality maintained at a low level, daily new cases increased faster than the other three countries. This result indicated that a mitigation strategy could be inferior to a containment strategy.","Chen, Haiqian; Shi, Leiyu; Zhang, Yuyao; Wang, Xiaohan; Sun, Gang",Global Health,55,20

The present prospective study extends this research by examining both specific emotion regulation strategies and global emotion regulation difficulties in the context of acute stress following onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic in 119 young adults. As part of a larger study, emotion regulation was assessed prior to pandemic onset (January 2019 - February 2020) using two standard measures (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, ERQ, Gross & John, 2003; Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, DERS, Gratz & Roemer, 2004). A self-report assessment of acute stress was conducted 2-3½ weeks after the COVID-19 pandemic declaration. Results demonstrated cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression (i.e., ERQ) were not individually predictive of acute stress; however, there was a significant interaction of suppression by reappraisal. Simple effects indicated suppression was negatively associated with acute stress only when reappraisal levels were high. Greater global emotion regulation difficulties (i.e., DERS), particularly nonacceptance of emotions and limited access to emotion regulation strategies, significantly predicted greater acute stress. These results provide further evidence of the temporal relationship between emotion dysregulation and stress reactions, and also suggest the expected effects of emotion regulation strategies may differ across contexts.","Tyra, Alexandra T; Griffin, Siobhán M; Fergus, Thomas A; Ginty, Annie T",J Anxiety Disord,55,1

Dry aging of beef resulted in decreased lightness (L*), redness (a*), and yellowness (b*) values and increased lipid oxidation compared to wet-aged counterparts (P < 0.05). Dry-aged steaks had greater discoloration (P < 0.05) than wet-aged steaks from d 4 to d 7 of RD. Results suggest that under prolonged RD, dry aging of beef has the potential to reduce color and lipid stability compared to wet aging and thus reduce display life. Color and lipid stability were not affected by RH during dry aging.","Ribeiro, Felipe Azevedo; Lau, Soon K; Pflanzer, Sérgio B; Subbiah, Jeyamkondan; Calkins, Chris R",Meat Sci,55,15

ACE2 is one of the key enzymes in renin-angiotensin system and plays a vital role in the maintenance of cardiovascular function. ACE/ACE2 balance is critical in the regulation of blood pressure, electrolyte homeostasis, vascular and cardiac remodeling and inflammation. ACE2 was shown to be abundantly present in human epithelial cells of the lung and enterocytes of the small intestine as well as in endothelial cells of the arterial and venous vessels. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are colocalized on the cell surface and produced a critical step host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2-cleaved ACE2 permits SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry however, ADAM17-cleaved ACE2 produces protective effects in several organs. Differently, basigin (CD147) was suggested as a putative alternate receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into endothelial cells. The intestinal ACE2 receptor is associated with the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 and ACE2 is necessary for the expression of this transporter on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells. There is a good association between the localization of SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 and the disease target organs in respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. Decreased expression of ACE2, being a receptor for coronavirus, would prevent cellular entry of the virus thereby reducing progression of the infection. However, increased ACE2 expression produces beneficial health effects. Further studies are needed to clarify this conflicting situation. Currently, it is recommended to continue the therapy with ACE2-increasing drugs in patients with COVID-19.","Guney, Ceren; Akar, Fatma",J Pharm Pharm Sci,55,16

While logistically, the use of digital technologies offers an obvious solution, attention must be given to these methods' pedagogical appropriateness, mainly how students engage and learn in the spaces supported by these technologies. In this context, we explored the degree to which digital technologies have contributed to teaching and learning practices over the past decade. The study employed a systematic review using a newly developed tripartite model for conducting and presenting literature review reports. The model approaches the literature review process systematically and employs three phases for the critical examination of literature: description, synthesis, and critique. The current review focused on student engagement across technologies that encompass social media, video, and collaborative learning technologies. Relevant articles were obtained from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Three core themes were identified: there was no shared understanding of what constitutes student engagement with learning technologies, there was a lack of explanation concerning the contextual variation and modalities of student engagement across the digital technologies, and self-reporting was the primary method of measuring student engagement, rendering results as perceptual rather than behavioural. We argue that using multiple datasets and different methodological approaches can provide further insights into student engagement with digital technologies. This approach to measuring engagement can substantiate findings and most likely provide additional insights into students' engagement with digital technologies.","Nkomo Larian, M.; Daniel, Ben K.; Butson, Russell J.",International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education,55,16

The profiles corresponding to bioactive substances were obtained by TraceFinderTM software using accurate mass databases with 53 and 24 polyphenolic and curcuminoid related compounds, respectively. For that purpose, 21 turmeric and 9 curry samples commercially available were analyzed in triplicate by a simple liquid-solid extraction procedure using dimethyl sulfoxide as extracting solvent. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed profiles were excellent chemical descriptors for sample characterization and classification by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), achieving 100% classification rates. Curcuminoids and some specific phenolic acids such as trans-cinnamic, ferulic and sinapic acids, helped on the discrimination of turmeric samples; polyphenols, in general, were responsible for the curry sample distinction. Besides, the combination of both polyphenolic and curcuminoid profiles was necessary for the simultaneous characterization and classification of turmeric and curry samples.

The prevalence of MPS among patients presenting to medical clinics due to pain ranges anywhere from 30 to 93%. This may be due to the lack of clear criteria and guidelines in diagnosing MPS. Despite the prevalence of MPS, its pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. There are many different ways to manage and treat MPS. Some include exercise, TrP injections, medications, and other alternative therapies. More research is needed to form uniformly-accepted diagnostic criteria and treatments.","Urits, Ivan; Charipova, Karina; Gress, Kyle; Schaaf, Amanda L; Gupta, Soham; Kiernan, Hayley C; Choi, Paula E; Jung, Jai Won; Cornett, Elyse; Kaye, Alan D; Viswanath, Omar",Best Pract Res Clin Anaesthesiol,55,33

Alongside COVID-19, diabetes is a long-standing global epidemic. The diabetes population has been reported to suffer adverse outcomes if infected by COVID-19. The aim was to summarise information and resources available on diabetes and COVID-19, highlighting special measures that individuals with diabetes need to follow. METHODS: A search using keywords ""COVID-19"" and ""Diabetes"" was performed using different sources, including PubMed and World Health Organization. RESULTS: COVID-19 may enhance complications in individuals with diabetes through an imbalance in angiotension-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activation pathways leading to an inflammatory response. ACE2 imbalance in the pancreas causes acute ß-cell dysfunction and a resultant hyperglycemic state. These individuals may be prone to worsened COVID-19 complications including vasculopathy, coagulopathy as well as psychological stress. Apart from general preventive measures, remaining hydrated, monitoring blood glucose regularly and monitoring ketone bodies in urine if on insulin is essential. All this while concurrently maintaining physical activity and a healthy diet. Different supporting entities are being set up to help this population. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is a top priority. It is important to remember that a substantial proportion of the world's population is affected by other co-morbidities such as diabetes. These require special attention during this pandemic to avoid adding on to the burden of countries' healthcare systems.","Cuschieri, Sarah; Grech, Stephan",J Diabetes Complications,55,22

The aims of the study were to determine the frequency of VTE in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and its correlation with D dimer levels and pharmacological prophylaxis. METHODS: This was a cohort study of critically ill patients due to COVID-19. All patients admitted to the intensive care unit on the same day of April 2020 were selected, regardless of length of stay, and a single bilateral venous duplex ultrasound in the lower extremities was performed up to 72 hours later. Pulmonary embolism (PE) was diagnosed by computed tomography angiography. Asymptomatic and symptomatic VTE were registered, including pre-screening in hospital VTE. Characteristics of patients, blood test results, doses of thromboprophylaxis received, VTE events, and mortality after seven day follow up were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 230 critically ill patients were studied. The median intensive care unit stay of these patients was 12 days (interquartile range [IQR] 5 - 19 days). After seven days follow up, the frequency of patients with VTE, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, was 26.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 21% - 32%) (69 events in 61 patients): 45 with DVT and 16 with PE (eight of them with concomitant DVT). The cumulative frequency of symptomatic VTE was 8.3% (95% CI 4.7% - 11.8%). D dimer values &#8805; 1 500 ng/mL were diagnostic of VTE, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 42%. During follow up after screening, six patients developed new VTE. Three of them developed a recurrence after a DVT diagnosed at screening, despite receiving therapeutic doses of heparin. Mortality rates at seven day follow up were the same for those with (6.6%) and without (5.3%) VTE. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe COVID-19 infection are at high risk of VTE, and further new symptomatic VTE events and recurrence can occur despite anticoagulation. The prophylactic anticoagulant dose may need to be increased in patients with a low risk of bleeding.","Bellmunt-Montoya, Sergi; Riera, Claudia; Gil, Daniel; Rodríguez, Manuela; García-Reyes, Marvin; Martínez-Carnovale, Lucía; Marrero, Carlos; Gil, Miquel; Ruiz-Rodríguez, Juan Carlos; Ferrer, Ricard; de Nadal, Miriam; Monreal, Manel; Llagostera, Secundino",Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,55,6

METHODS: A survey was conducted of endoscopists from LA consisting of 43 questions for the evaluation of four items: general and sociodemographic features, and preprocedure, intraprocedure and postprocedure aspects. RESULTS: A response was obtained from 338 endoscopists (response rate 34.5%) across 15 countries in LA. In preprocedure aspects (hand washing, use of face masks for patients, respiratory triage area, training for the placement/removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) and availability of specific area for the placement/removal of PPE), there was adherence in <75%. Regarding postprocedure aspects, 77% (261/338) had reused PPE, mainly the N95 respirator or higher, and this was with a standardised decontamination procedure only in 32% (108/338) of the time. Postprocedure room decontamination was carried out by 47% on >75% of occasions. In relationship to intraprocedure aspects (knowledge of risk and type of endoscopic procedures, use of PPE, airway management in patients and infrastructure), there was adherence in >75% for all the parameters and 78% of endoscopists only performed emergencies or time-sensitive procedures.

In the fight against this novel disease, there is a pressing need for rapid and effective screening tools to identify patients infected with COVID-19, and to this end CT imaging has been proposed as one of the key screening methods which may be used as a complement to RT-PCR testing, particularly in situations where patients undergo routine CT scans for non-COVID-19 related reasons, patients with worsening respiratory status or developing complications that require expedited care, and patients suspected to be COVID-19-positive but have negative RT-PCR test results. Motivated by this, in this study we introduce COVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via a machine-driven design exploration approach. Additionally, we introduce COVIDx-CT, a benchmark CT image dataset derived from CT imaging data collected by the China National Center for Bioinformation comprising 104,009 images across 1,489 patient cases. Furthermore, in the interest of reliability and transparency, we leverage an explainability-driven performance validation strategy to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVIDNet-CT, and in doing so ensure that COVIDNet-CT makes predictions based on relevant indicators in CT images. Both COVIDNet-CT and the COVIDx-CT dataset are available to the general public in an open-source and open access manner as part of the COVID-Net initiative. While COVIDNet-CT is not yet a production-ready screening solution, we hope that releasing the model and dataset will encourage researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to leverage and build upon them.","Gunraj, Hayden; Wang, Linda; Wong, Alexander",,55,20

Recruitment occurred during April 5 - 30, 2000, amid the lockdown (March 23-May 03), when people were asked to follow the stringent lockdown constraint enforced by the Greek government. Sociodemographic data were collected. The Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale measured secondary traumatic stress (STS) for the HCWs. The Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory, the Brief Resilience Scale, and the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory measured posttraumatic growth, resilience, and coping strategies, respectively. Regression analyses demonstrated that resilience and coping strategies were differentially associated with positive and negative (stress/growth) lockdown outcomes.

This coronavirus enters cells by the interaction of the receptor binding domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (hACE2). In this study, we employed a rational structure-based design to propose 22-mer stapled peptides using the structure of the hACE2 &#945;1 helix as a template. These peptides were designed to retain the &#945;-helical character of the natural structure, to enhance binding affinity, and to display a better solubility profile compared to other designed peptides available in the literature. We employed different docking strategies (PATCHDOCK and ZDOCK) followed by a double-step refinement process (FIBERDOCK) to rank our peptides, followed by stability analysis/evaluation of the interaction profile of the best docking predictions using a 500 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and a further binding affinity analysis by molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area (MM/GBSA) method. Our most promising stapled peptides presented a stable profile and could retain important interactions with the RBD in the presence of the E484K RBD mutation. We predict that these peptides can bind to the viral RBD with similar potency to the control NYBSP-4 (a 30-mer experimentally proven peptide inhibitor). Furthermore, our study provides valuable information for the rational design of double-stapled peptide as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","de Campos, Luana Janaína; Palermo, Nicholas Y; Conda-Sheridan, Martin",J Phys Chem B,55,20

Even if for some interviewed men it was an occasion to experience a more involved fatherhood, for the majority of them a rethinking of their commitment in paid work is inconceivable. Conversely, mothers are more keen on considering job requests as negotiable and perceive a pervasive interference of work on family life, while their husbands often claim that childcare activities may reduce their productivity. Remote work does not allow the redefinition of the working models and does not improve the work-life balance of interviewed couples, which is still considerably unbalanced towards job, with a limited space and time for individual activities. Moreover, remote work, even in this unprecedented extreme situation, does not modify gender normative roles within domestic domain and thus it reproduces and sometimes exacerbates gender inequalities with women trying to balance their double role and fathers expanding the time devoted to work. © 2020.

Vast resources have been allocated to control the pandemic and treat patients. However, little attention has been paid to the adverse impact on mental health or effective mitigation strategies to improve mental health. (2) Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Chinese college students' mental health, understand the underlying mechanisms, and explore feasible mitigation strategies. (3) Methods: During the peak time of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we conducted longitudinal surveys of sixty-six college students. Structured questionnaires collected information on demographics, physical activity, negative emotions, sleep quality, and aggressiveness level. A mixed-effect model was used to evaluate associations between variables, and the mediating effect of sleep quality was further explored. A generalized additive model was used to determine the dose-response relationships between the COVID-19 death count, physical activity, and negative emotions. (4) Results: The COVID-19 death count showed a direct negative impact on general sleep quality (ß = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.55, 2.19) and reduced aggressiveness (ß = -6.57, 95% CI: -12.78, -0.36). In contrast, the COVID-19 death count imposed not a direct but an indirect impact on general negative emotions (indirect effect (IE) = 0.81, p = 0.012), stress (IE = 0.40, p < 0.001), and anxiety (IE = 0.27, p = 0.004) with sleep quality as a mediator. Moreover, physical activity directly alleviated general negative emotions (ß = -0.12, 95% CI: -0.22, -0.01), and the maximal mitigation effect occurred when weekly physical activity was about 2500 METs. (5) Conclusions: (a) The severity of the COVID-19 outbreak has an indirect effect on negative emotions by affecting sleep quality. (b) A possible mitigation strategy for improving mental health includes taking suitable amounts of daily physical activity and sleeping well.","Zhang, Yao; Zhang, Haoyu; Ma, Xindong; Di, Qian",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),55,13

Due to the known induction of coagulation pathways during COVID-19 infections, possible interaction between nintedanib and anticoagulant seems to be an extremely important issue. In theory, nintedanib could increase the bleeding risk, thrombosis and lead to thrombocytopenia. The data from clinical trials on the concomitant use of nintedanib and antithrombotic agents is very limited as this patient group was within the standard exclusion criteria. Nintedanib is an important therapeutic option, despite its interaction with anticoagulants.

The neural mechanisms that support this novel cognitive faculty are still unknown. On the other hand, reading and calculation abilities represent slightly less recent human activities, in which neural correlates are relatively well understood. We hypothesize that calculus and reading brain networks provide joint underpinnings with distinctly weighted contributions which concern programming tasks, in particular concerning error identification. Based on a meta-analysis of the core regions involved in both reading and math and recent experimental evidence on the neural basis of programming tasks, we provide a theoretical account that integrates the role of these networks in program understanding. In this connectivity-based framework, error-monitoring processing regions in the frontal cortex influence the insula, which is a pivotal hub within the salience network, leading into efficient causal modulation of parietal networks involved in reading and mathematical operations. The core role of the anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex is illuminated by their relation to performance in error processing and novelty. The larger similarity that we observed between the networks underlying calculus and programming skills does not exclude a more limited but clear overlap with the reading network, albeit with differences in hemispheric lateralization when compared with prose reading. Future work should further elucidate whether other features of computer program understanding also use distinct weights of phylogenetically ""older systems"" for this recent human activity, based on the adjusting influence of fronto-insular networks. By unraveling the neural correlates of program understanding and bug detection, this work provides a framework to understand error monitoring in this novel complex faculty.","Castelhano, Joao; Duarte, Isabel C; Duraes, Joao; Madeira, Henrique; Castelo-Branco, Miguel",Neural Plast,55,1

Recognition of viral RNA by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) activates a signaling cascade that leads to type I interferon (IFN-&#945;/ß) gene transcription. Multiple proteins in this signaling pathway (e.g. RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, TBK1, IRF3) are regulated by (de)ubiquitination events. Most viruses have evolved mechanisms to counter this antiviral response. The leader protease (Lpro) of foot-and-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) has been recognized to reduce IFN-&#945;/ß gene transcription; however, the exact mechanism is unknown. The proteolytic activity of Lpro is vital for releasing itself from the viral polyprotein and for cleaving and degrading specific host cell proteins, such as eIF4G and NF-&#954;B. In addition, Lpro has been demonstrated to have deubiquitination/deISGylation activity. Lpro's deubiquitination/deISGylation activity and the cleavage/degradation of signaling proteins have both been postulated to be important for reduced IFN-&#945;/ß gene transcription. Here, we demonstrate that TBK1, the kinase that phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor IRF3, is cleaved by Lpro in FMDV-infected cells as well as in cells infected with a recombinant EMCV expressing Lpro. In vitro cleavage experiments revealed that Lpro cleaves TBK1 at residues 692-694. We also observed cleavage of MAVS in HeLa cells infected with EMCV-Lpro, but only observed decreasing levels of MAVS in FMDV-infected porcine LFPK &#945;Vß6 cells. We set out to dissect Lpro's ability to cleave RLR signaling proteins from its deubiquitination/deISGylation activity to determine their relative contributions to the reduction of IFN-&#945;/ß gene transcription. The introduction of specific mutations, of which several were based on the recently published structure of Lpro in complex with ISG15, allowed us to identify specific amino acid substitutions that separate the different proteolytic activities of Lpro. Characterization of the effects of these mutations revealed that Lpro's ability to cleave RLR signaling proteins but not its deubiquitination/deISGylation activity correlates with the reduced IFN-ß gene transcription.","Visser, Linda J; Aloise, Chiara; Swatek, Kirby N; Medina, Gisselle N; Olek, Karin M; Rabouw, Huib H; de Groot, Raoul J; Langereis, Martijn A; de Los Santos, Teresa; Komander, David; Skern, Tim; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M",PLoS Pathog,55,0

METHODS: Single centre prospective observational cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing elective cataract surgery in the United Kingdom over a 3 month period from May to August 2020. Electronic medical records were reviewed and patients were contacted at 30 days post-operatively. Data collection included symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection, hospital admission, mortality, intra-operative and post-operative surgical complications. RESULTS: A total of 649 elective cataract surgeries were performed. Two patients (0.3%) developed worsening dyspnoea during the 30 day post-operative period, but tested negative for COVID-19 infection. Three patients (0.5%) were hospitalised, unrelated to COVID-19 infection, of which one patient (0.2%) passed.

Rex1 promoter-Red Fluorescence Protein reporter ESC were tested by RNAseq after 72hr exposures to control stress hyperosmotic sorbitol under stemness culture (NS) to quantify stress-forced differentiation (SFD) transcriptomic programs. Control ESC cultured with stemness factor removal produced normal differentiation (ND). Bulk RNAseq transcriptomic analysis showed significant upregulation of two genes involved in Covid-19 cell uptake, Vimentin (VIM) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2). SFD increased the hepatitis A virus receptor (Havcr1) and the transplacental Herpes simplex 1 (HSV1) virus receptor (Pvrl1) compared with ESC undergoing ND. Several other coronavirus receptors, Glutamyl Aminopeptidase (ENPEP) and Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) were upregulated significantly in SFD>ND. Although stressed ESC are more susceptible to infection due to increased expression of viral receptors and decreased resistance, the necessary Covid-19 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2, was not expressed in our experiments. TMPRSS2, ENPEP, and DPP4 mediate Coronavirus uptake, but are also markers of extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN), which arise from ESC undergoing ND or SFD. Mouse and human ESCs differentiated to XEN increase TMPRSS2 and other Covid-19 uptake-mediating gene expression, but only some lines express ACE2. Covid-19 susceptibility appears to be genotype-specific and not ubiquitous. Of the 30 gene ontology (GO) groups for viral susceptibility, 15 underwent significant stress-forced changes. Of these, 4 GO groups mediated negative viral regulation and most genes in these increase in ND and decrease with SFD, thus suggesting that stress increases ESC viral susceptibility. Taken together, the data suggest that a control hyperosmotic stress can increase Covid-19 susceptibility and decrease viral host resistance in mouse ESC. However, this limited pilot study should be followed with studies in human ESC, tests of environmental, hormonal, and pharmaceutical stressors and direct tests for infection of stressed, cultured ESC and embryos by Covid-19.","Abdulhasan, Mohammed; Ruden, Ximena; Rappolee, Benjamin; Dutta, Sudipta; Gurdziel, Katherine; Ruden, Douglas M; Awonuga, Awoniyi O; Korzeniewski, Steve J; Puscheck, Elizabeth E; Rappolee, Daniel A",,55,16

A high-quality and easy-to-use prognostic model to predict in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients could support physicians to make better clinical decisions. METHODS: Fine-Gray models were used to derive a prognostic model to predict in-hospital mortality (treating discharged alive from hospital as the competing event) in COVID-19 patients using two retrospective cohorts (n = 1008) in Wuhan, China from January 1 to February 10, 2020. The proposed model was internally evaluated by bootstrap approach and externally evaluated in an external cohort (n = 1031). RESULTS: The derivation cohort was a case-mix of mild-to-severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients (43.6% females, median age 55). The final model (PLANS), including five predictor variables of platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex, had an excellent predictive performance (optimism-adjusted C-index: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.87; averaged calibration slope: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.08). Internal validation showed little overfitting. External validation using an independent cohort (47.8% female, median age 63) demonstrated excellent predictive performance (C-index: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.89; calibration slope: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.12). The averaged predicted cumulative incidence curves were close to the observed cumulative incidence curves in patients with different risk profiles. CONCLUSIONS: The PLANS model based on five routinely collected predictors would assist clinicians in better triaging patients and allocating healthcare resources to reduce COVID-19 fatality.","Li, Jiong; Chen, Yuntao; Chen, Shujing; Wang, Sihua; Zhang, Dingyu; Wang, Junfeng; Postmus, Douwe; Zeng, Hesong; Qin, Guoyou; Shen, Yin; Jiang, Jinjun; Yu, Yongfu",BMC Infect Dis,55,0

METHODS: A nationwide online, cross-sectional survey was conducted in Qatar from 15th October 2020 to 15th November 2020 with voluntary participation open to all adult residents. Of the respondents, the population group for this study comprised the 341 pregnant and breastfeeding participants. The survey utilized a composite questionnaire incorporating a validated instrument to measure vaccine attitudes. The responses were recorded and analysed with statistical analysis being performed with SPSS software. Outcome measures included intentions towards vaccination and potential factors influencing vaccine hesitancy (contextual factors, vaccine specific concerns and group/individual influences). RESULTS: Perinatal women exhibited a vaccine hesitancy rate of 25% towards COVID-19 immunisation. The main concerns of the group were of infection risks and main factor determining vaccine hesitancy was of vaccine specific safety concerns. Previous vaccine ""acceptors"" showed vaccine hesitancy to COVID-19 immunisation. A third of the group cited non availability of the vaccine as a concern. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine trials amongst pregnant and lactating women have lagged behind those for general populations and this has compounded concerns around safety in this special group. Perinatal women constitute a vulnerable group and play an important role in vaccination of wider family members. This study highlights the need for trials and data for COVID-19 vaccine in this group to be able to achieve appreciable numbers needed for herd immunity and ultimately control of the pandemic.","Mohan, Suruchi; Reagu, Shuja; Lindow, Stephen; Alabdulla, Majid",J. perinat. med,55,20

Brain fitness, like physical fitness, requires exercise. Brain-based ""workout"" activities improve cognitive development, and their effects can be seen in academic and professional performance, quality of life, and mental health and well-being. Brain fitness has been shown to produce dramatic academic and social improvements, particularly in school-age education. In the United States, unfortunately, the brain fitness of students is not being systemically addressed. A key measure of the neurocognitive capacities foundational to all learning is called executive function (EF). Research has found that EF is a powerful indicator of not only academic performance and outcomes, but also life outcomes such as career and wealth, relationships, health, well-being, and even public safety. Unfortunately, when schools take too limited an approach and focus mainly on content and achievement scores, these underlying EF cognitive capacities of children to self-regulate, process, integrate, and learn are often unknowingly ignored by well-meaning educators.

In embryonic development, progenitor fetal cells are actively involved in reparative mechanisms and display a biphasic interaction with the mother; and there is constant trafficking of fetal cells into maternal circulation and vice versa. This phenomenon of fetal microchimerism may have significant impact considering the primitive, multilineage nature of these cells. In published work, we have reported that fetal-derived placental cells expressing the homeodomain protein CDX2 retain all ""stem"" functional proteins of embryonic stem cells yet are endowed with additional functions in areas of growth, survival, homing, and immune modulation. These cells exhibit multipotency in vitro and in vivo, giving rise to spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes and vascular cells. In mouse models, CDX2 cells from female placentas can be administered intravenously to male mice subjected to myocardial infarction with subsequent homing of the CDX2 cells to infarcted areas and evidence of cellular regeneration with enhanced cardiac function. Elucidating the role of microchimeric fetal-derived placental cells may have broader scientific potential, as one can envision allogeneic cell therapy strategies targeted at tissue regeneration for a variety of organ systems.","Vadakke-Madathil, Sangeetha; Chaudhry, Hina W",Ann.

We aimed to compare pediatric surgery practices, including the number and types of surgery, either elective or emergency surgeries and outpatient services, before the outbreak and during the COVID-19 pandemic in our institution. Material and methods: We retrospectively compared pediatric surgery practices, including elective and emergency surgeries, and outpatient services between the previous one-year period (March 2019-February 2020), the last three months of that period (December 2019-February 2020) before the outbreak, and the three months (March-May 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic in our hospital. Results: The frequency of elective surgeries during the pandemic was lower than during the last three months before the outbreak: 61 vs. 18 (~3-fold), 19 vs. 13 (~1.5-fold), 19 vs. 5 (~4-fold), and 30 vs. 15 (~2-fold) for digestive, neonate, urology and oncology cases, respectively. No laparoscopic procedures were performed during the pandemic compared with the one-year period before the outbreak (0 vs. 16 cases). The frequency of all emergency pediatric procedures before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was similar (29 vs. 20 cases, respectively). Moreover, a declining trend was also clearly apparent in the outpatient services during the pandemic compared with before the outbreak, both in the new and the established patients. Conclusions: The pediatric surgery practices in our institution have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including elective and outpatient services. This setback needs a comprehensive strategy to avoid morbidity from the neglected elective surgeries during the pandemic, including the proper comparison between the real risk of COVID-19 cross-infection and the benefits of elective procedures.","Idham, Yofizal; Paramita, Vincentia Meta Widya; Fauzi, Aditya Rifqi; Dwihantoro, Andi; Makhmudi, Akhmad",Ann Med Surg (Lond),55,1

The coil model and numerical simulation are firstly given to demonstrate the array coil configuration, B1 field map and mutual coupling effects on coil sensitivity. Capacitive network is then introduced to be theoretically and practically analyzed to minimize coupling effects.

Since the start of the pandemic, real time RT-PCR diagnostic testing from upper respiratory specimens, such as nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, has been the standard. Moreover, respiratory samples in viral transport media are the ideal specimen for SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS). In early 2021, many clinicians transitioned to antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tests, which use anterior nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection. Despite this shift in testing methods, the need for whole-genome sequence surveillance remains. Thus, we developed a workflow for whole-genome sequencing with antigen test-derived swabs as an input rather than nasopharyngeal swabs. In this study, we use excess clinical specimens processed using the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card. We demonstrate that whole-genome sequencing from antigen tests is feasible and yields similar results from RT-PCR-based assays utilizing a swab in viral transport media.","Nazario-Toole, Ashley E; Nguyen, Holly M; Xia, Hui; Frankel, Dianne N; Kieffer, John W; Gibbons, Thomas F",,55,24

Historically the emergence of new diseases has had little or no impact beyond a small, localized cluster of infections. However, given just the right conditions, a highly virulent pathogen can suddenly spread across time and space with massive consequences, as has occurred on several occasions in human history. In the wake of the SARS outbreak, we are now forced to confront the unpleasant fact that human activities are increasing the frequency and severity of these kinds of emergences. The idea of more frequent biological ''invasions'' with economic and societal impacts comparable to SARS, presents stakeholders in the global economy with unprecedented new risks, challenges and even opportunities.

Stressful and cognitively demanding events can disrupt EFs and interfere with health behavior, possibly to a greater extent in those with preexisting EF deficits. This study examined the association between preexisting EF deficits and subsequent negative changes in eating patterns, physical activity, sedentariness, and alcohol/substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Participants were 374 young adults in a follow-up study of the longitudinal, multisite Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD). Preexisting EF deficits were assessed with the Barkley Deficits in Executive Function Scales-Short Form, and personally impactful negative changes in four health behaviors (physical activity, unhealthy eating, sedentary time, alcohol/substance use) during the COVID-19 pandemic were subsequently assessed with the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory. RESULTS: In ordered logistic regression models, higher preexisting total EF deficits were associated with greater negative impactful changes in physical activity and unhealthy eating, independent of sociodemographic variables, obesity, and (as relevant) accelerometer-based physical activity and pre-COVID-19 diet quality. Socioeconomic status moderated the association between total EF deficits and impactful change in alcohol/substance use, with EF deficits linked to greater impactful change in alcohol/substance use only in higher socioeconomic strata. CONCLUSION: Individuals with preexisting EF deficits appear more vulnerable to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on several key health behaviors. As the pandemic unfolds, strategies may be needed to identify those with EF deficits (e.g., screening tools) and provide them with tailored support for chronic disease risk reduction.","Appelhans, Bradley M; Thomas, Alexis S; Roisman, Glenn I; Booth-LaForce, Cathryn; Bleil, Maria E",Int. j. behav. med,55,16

Although some tools exist for transgene misexpression in developing chick embryos, we have refined and advanced them by simplifying and optimizing constructs for spatiotemporal control. To maintain expression over the entire course of embryonic development we use an enhanced piggyBac transposon system that efficiently integrates sequences into the host genome. We also incorporate a DNA targeting sequence to direct plasmid translocation into the nucleus and a D4Z4 insulator sequence to prevent epigenetic silencing. We designed these constructs to minimize their size and maximize cellular uptake, and to simplify usage by placing all of the integrating sequences on a single plasmid. Following electroporation of stage HH8.5 embryos, our tetracycline-inducible promoter construct produces robust transgene expression in the presence of doxycycline at any point during embryonic development in ovo or in culture. Moreover, expression levels can be modulated by titrating doxycycline concentrations and spatial control can be achieved using beads or gels. Thus, we have generated a novel, sensitive, tunable, and stable inducible-promoter system for high-resolution gene manipulation in vivo.","Chu, Daniel; Nguyen, An; Smith, Spenser S; Vavrusová, Zuzana; Schneider, Richard A",,55,1

Italy was the first country to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in Europe. One of the measures adopted by the Italian government during COVID-19 pandemic was the total lockdown of the cities with complete confinement at home. We aimed to examine the impact of the lockdown caused by COVID-19 pandemic on exclusive breastfeeding in non-infected mothers. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 204 mother-baby dyads during lockdown (9 March to 8 May 2020) that we compared to previously studied 306 mother-baby dyads admitted during the year 2018. To reduce the possible effect of confounding factors on exclusive breastfeeding, a 1:1 matching was performed by using an automatized procedure of stratification that paired 173 mother-baby dyads. Feeding modality was collected at discharge, 30 and 90 days of newborn's life. Exclusive breastfeeding was considered when the infant received only breast milk and no other liquids or solids were given with the exception of vitamins, minerals or medicines. RESULTS: At discharge 69.4% of infants were exclusively breastfed during lockdown versus 97.7% of control group, 54.3% at 30 days vs 76.3 and 31.8% vs 70.5% at 90 days (p < 0.001). The proportion of breastfeeding remaining exclusive from discharge to 30-day was similar between groups (about 80%), but it was lower in lockdown group than in control cohort (58.5% vs 92.4%, p < 0.001) from 30- to 90-days. CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown and home confinement led to a decrease of exclusively breastfeeding in the studied population. Considering the timing to shift from exclusive to non-exclusive breastfeeding, differences between study groups were concentrated during hospital stay and from 30- to 90 days of a newborn's life, confirming that the hospital stay period is crucial in continuing exclusive breastfeeding at least for the first 30 days, but no longer relevant at 90 days of life.","Latorre, Giuseppe; Martinelli, Domenico; Guida, Pietro; Masi, Ester; De Benedictis, Roberta; Maggio, Luca",Int Breastfeed J,55,32

However, the use of face masks among children, especially those aged younger than 3 years, is debated, and the US Centers for Disease Control and American Academy of Physicians recommend the use of face mask only among individuals aged 3 years or older. Objective: To examine whether the use of surgical facial masks among children is associated with episodes of oxygen desaturation or respiratory distress. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted from May through June 2020 in a secondary-level hospital pediatric unit in Italy. Included participants were 47 healthy children divided by age (ie, group A, aged &#8804;24 months, and group B, aged >24 months to &#8804;144 months). Data were analyzed from May through June 2020. Interventions: All participants were monitored every 15 minutes for changes in respiratory parameters for the first 30 minutes while not wearing a surgical face mask and for the next 30 minutes while wearing a face mask. Children aged 24 months and older then participated in a walking test for 12 minutes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes in respiratory parameters during the use of surgical masks were evaluated. Results: Among 47 children, 22 children (46.8%) were aged 24 months or younger (ie, group A), with 11 boys (50.0%) and median (interquartile range [IQR]) age 12.5 (10.0-17.5) months, and 25 children (53.2%) were aged older than 24 months to 144 months or younger, with 13 boys (52.0%) and median (IQR) age 100.0 (72.0-120.0) months.

METHODS: Participants (N= 1267, 40.9% women) were recruited from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Haiti, Rwanda, and Togo. They completed an online cross-sectional survey on sociodemographics, exposure and stigmatization related to COVID-19, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression subscale, and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence for depression symptoms was 24.3% (95% CI: 22.08-26.79%), with significant differences across countries. Younger age, gender (women), and high levels of exposure and stigmatization related to COVIID-19, and resilience were associated with depression in the pooled data. There were significant variations at the country level. Stigmatization (but not exposure to COVID-19 and resilience) was a strong predictor among the four countries.

Recent events involving the COVID-19 virus shows that it is possible for a viral strain to emerge from a population at a time when the influenza virus, a well-known virus with a vaccine readily available, is active in a population. We solved for four different equilibrium points and investigated the conditions for existence and local stability.

To schematize the current SARS-CoV-2 migration scenario between and within the three countries chosen, using the multitype bearth-death model implemented in BEAST2. Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a rate of evolution of 2.11 × 10-3 per sites per year (95% highest posterior density: 1.56 × 10-3 to 3.89 × 10-3 ), and a geographic origin in Shanghai, where time until the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) emerged, according to the analysis of the molecular clock, around 13 November 2019. While for Italy and Spain, there are two tMRCA for each country, which agree with the assumption of several introductions for these countries. That explains also this very short period of subepidermal circulation before the recent events. A total of 8 (median) migration events occurred during this short period, the largest proportion of which (6 events [75%]) occurred from Shanghai (China) to Spain and from Italy to Spain. Such events are marked by speeds of migration that are comparatively lower as compared with that from Shanghai to Italy. Shanghai's R0 and Italy's are closer to each other, though Spain's is slightly higher. All these results allow us to conclude the need for an automatic system of mixed, molecular and classical epidemiological surveillance, which could play a role in this global surveillance of public health and decision-making.","Nabil, Benazi; Sabrina, Bounab; Abdelhakim, Bounab",J. med. virol,55,14

These changes include anosmia and dysgeusia. In some cases, these clinical manifestations appear even before the general flu-like symptoms, e.g., sore throat, thoracic oppression and fever. There is no direct report available on the loss of these chemical senses in obese COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, obesity has been shown to be associated with low ONS cues. These alterations in obese subjects are due to obesity-induced altered expression of olfacto-taste receptors. Besides, obesity may further aggravate the SARS-CoV-2 infection, as this pathology is associated with a high degree of inflammation/immunosuppression and reduced protection against viral infections. Hence, obesity represents a great risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it may hide the viral-associated altered ONS symptoms, thus leading to a high mortality rate in these subjects.","Khan, Amira Sayed; Hichami, Aziz; Khan, Naim Akhtar",,55,24

This study explored the intervention efficacy of a mobile application on addressing psychological problems related to COVID-19. METHODS: A longitudinal control trial involving 129 Chinese participants with depression symptoms was conducted through the mobile application ""Care for Your Mental Health and Sleep during COVID-19"" (CMSC) based on WeChat. Participants were divided into two groups: mobile internet cognitive behavioral therapy (MiCBT) and wait-list. The primary outcome was improvement in depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes included improvement in anxiety and insomnia. The MiCBT group received three self-help CBT intervention sessions in one week via CMSC. RESULTS: The MiCBT group showed significant improvement in depression and insomnia (allP < 0.05) compared with the wait-list group. Although both groups showed significant improvement in anxiety at the intervention's end, compared with the wait-list group, the MiCBT group had no significant advantage. Correlation analysis showed that improvement in depression and anxiety had a significant positive association with education level. Changes in insomnia were significantly negatively correlated with anxiety of COVID-19 at the baseline. CMSC was considered helpful (n=68, 81.9 %) and enjoyable (n=54, 65.9 %) in relieving depression and insomnia during the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: CMSC is verified to be effective and convenient for improving COVID-19-related depression and insomnia symptoms. A large study with sufficient evidence is required to determine its continuous effect on reducing mental health problems during the pandemic.","Song, Jiaqi; Jiang, Ronghuan; Chen, Nan; Qu, Wei; Liu, Dan; Zhang, Meng; Fan, Hongzhen; Zhao, Yanli; Tan, Shuping",Asian J Psychiatr,55,16

In particular, a specific Skyrme submodel, the so-called Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) Skyrme model, allows both for an exact field-theoretic and a mean-field treatment of neutron stars, as a consequence of its perfect fluid property. A pure BPS Skyrme model description of neutron stars, however, only describes the neutron star core, by construction. Here we consider different possibilities to extrapolate a BPS Skyrme neutron star at high baryon density to a description valid at lower densities. In the exact field-theoretic case, a simple effective description of the neutron star crust can be used, because the exact BPS Skyrme neutron star solutions formally extend to sufficiently low densities. In the mean-field case, on the other hand, the BPS Skyrme neutron star solutions always remain above the nuclear saturation density and, therefore, must be joined to a different nuclear physics equation of state already for the outer core. We study the resulting neutron stars in both cases, facilitating an even more complete comparison between Skyrmionic neutron stars and neutron stars obtained from other approaches, as well as with observations.","Adam, C.; Sanchez-Guillen, J.; Vazquez, R.; Wereszczynski, A.",,55,1

Then, we added the tertiles of the number of people tested for COVID-19 and those of health aids to evaluate the correspondence with the outcome measures. RESULTS: Five regions out of 20, the most industrialized northern regions, which were affected both earlier and more severely by the outbreak, registered both mortality and economic value loss above the overall medians. The southern regions, which were affected later and less severely, had low mortality and less economic impact.

Accurate disease diagnosis (for the SARS-Cov-2 virus and variants), coupled to patient isolation are currently critical strategies in restricting disease spread. Due to lack of time during this pandemic the diagnostics assays were not adequately validated. Infected individuals at times could potentially be missed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 tests due to incorrect/inefficient sampling procedure, low limit of detection and epidemiology of the virus. rRT-PCR test results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical examination and Computed Tomography (CT), particularly in suspected symptomatic individuals or those with epidemiological history of contact with known COVID-19 cases. Considering the above-mentioned constraints, the current scenario demands rapid and point-of-care tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in remote locations. To date, there is no reliable commercially available antigen detection kit. The infected subjects reveal low levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 through the early period of infection.

Individuals diagnosed with autism, intellectual, and developmental disabilities (AUIDD) typically require long-term care and targeted treatment and teaching. Effective treatment of AUIDD relies on efficient and careful behavioral observations done by trained applied behavioral analysts (ABAs). However, this process overburdens ABAs by requiring the clinicians to collect and analyze data, identify the problem behaviors, conduct pattern analysis to categorize and predict categorical outcomes, hypothesize responsiveness to treatments, and detect the effects of treatment plans. Successful integration of digital technologies into clinical decision-making pipelines and the advancements in automated decision-making using Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms highlights the importance of augmenting teaching and treatments using novel algorithms and high-fidelity sensors. In this article, we present an AI-Augmented Learning and Applied Behavior Analytics (AI-ABA) platform to provide personalized treatment and learning plans to AUIDD individuals. By defining systematic experiments along with automated data collection and analysis, AI-ABA can promote self-regulative behavior using reinforcement-based augmented or virtual reality and other mobile platforms. Thus, AI-ABA could assist clinicians to focus on making precise data-driven decisions and increase the quality of individualized interventions for individuals with AUIDD.","Ghafghazi, Shadi; Carnett, Amarie; Neely, Leslie; Das, Arun; Rad, Paul",,55,1

We aimed to describe the characteristics of liver function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection. METHODS: We enrolled all adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 and chronic HBV co-infection admitted to Tongji Hospital from February 1 to February 29, 2020. Data of demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected. The characteristics of liver function and its relation with the severity and prognosis of disease were described. RESULTS: Of 105 SARS-CoV-2 and chronic HBV co-infected patients, elevated levels of liver test were seen in several patients at admission, including elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (22, 20.95%), aspartate aminotransferase (29, 27.62%), total bilirubin (7, 6.67%), gamma-glutamyl transferase (7, 6.67%), and alkaline phosphatase (1, 0.95%). The values of the indices mentioned above increased substantially during hospitalization (all P < .05). Fourteen (13.33%) patients developed liver injury. Most of them (10, 71.43%) recovered after 8 (range 6-21) days. Notably, 4 (28.57%) patients rapidly progressed to acute-on-chronic liver failure. The proportion of severe COVID-19 was higher in patients with liver injury (P = .042). Complications including ACLF, acute cardiac injury and shock happened more frequently in patients with liver injury (all P < .05). The mortality was higher in individuals with liver injury (28.57% vs 3.30%, P = .004). CONCLUSION: Liver injury in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and chronic HBV co-infection was associated with severity and poor prognosis of disease. During the treatment of COVID-19 in chronic HBV-infected patients, liver function should be taken seriously and evaluated frequently.","Zou, Xiaojing; Fang, Minghao; Li, Shusheng; Wu, Liang; Gao, Bing; Gao, Hong; Ran, Xiao; Bian, Yi; Li, Renjie; Ling, Jianmin; Li, Donghui; Tian, Deying; Huang, Jiao",Clin. gastroenterol. hepatol,55,26

Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif (RBM) of its envelope spike protein for binding the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain viral entry. Currently, extensive efforts are being made to produce vaccines against a surface fragment of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein, in order to boost protective antibodies that can inhibit virus-ACE2 interaction to prevent viral entry. It was previously unknown how spike protein-targeting antibodies would affect innate inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we generated a highly purified recombinant protein corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV-2, and used it to screen for cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We found two RBM-binding mAbs that competitively inhibited its interaction with human ACE2, and specifically blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in both human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophage cultures. Our findings have suggested a possible strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2-elicited ""cytokine storm,"" and revealed a potentially anti-inflammatory and protective mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 spike-based vaccines.","Qiang, Xiaoling; Zhu, Shu; Li, Jianhua; Chen, Weiqiang; Yang, Huan; Wang, Ping; Tracey, Kevin J; Wang, Haichao",J. leukoc. biol,55,32

The present study therefore attempts to assess the implications of entire eco-restoration model as practiced by Department of Forest, Government of Uttarakhand in 2019. Its assessment was done by calculating restoration success index by way of considering three categories, viz., direct management measure (M), environmental desirability (E) and socio-economic feasibility (SE) considering 22 individual variables. 'M' comprised both biotic and abiotic pressures. Grazing and tourism were biotic, while abiotic pressure was considered mainly soil erosion in alpine area due to topographic fragility. Above ground vegetation profile and below ground soil nutrient profile (N, P, K, pH and water holding capacity) were analyzed in 'E' component. In the last but not least, 'SE' was analyzed to assess the social acceptability of the local communities and stakeholders who are supposed to be ultimate beneficiary of alike interventions. Direct management measure was found with the variable index score of 0.8 indicating the higher score as compared to environmental desirability (0.56). Under direct management measure, grazing and tourists' carrying capacity of the area was analyzed with high management needs to call the region sustainable in terms of availability of bio-resources. The ecosystem index score was evaluated for the reference (81.94), treated (64.5) and untreated zones (52.03), wherein increasing profile of these values were found. The outcomes like improved vegetation profile in terms of total herb density, soil nutrient profile of the restored area along with soil pH (4.96) and water holding capacity (49.85%) were found to be restored significantly along with controlling 169.64 tonne year-1 soil erosion from draining. The assessment of grazing pattern of 118 migratory Cow Unit (CU) (76 horse/mule and 18 sheep/goat, already controlled), 318 local CU (30 horse/mule and 187 sheep/goat) were calculated and recommended to be controlled.

Concerns exist that hospitals that care for hip fracture patients may be penalized in BPCI. The purpose of this study is to compare the episode-of-care (EOC) costs of hip fracture patients to elective THA patients. METHODS: We reviewed a consecutive series of 4096 THA patients from 2015 to 2018. Patients were grouped into elective THA (n = 3686), fracture THA (n = 176), and hemiarthroplasty (n = 274). Using CMS claims data, we compared EOC costs, postacute care costs, and performance against the target price between the groups. To control for confounding variables, we performed a multivariate analysis to identify the effect of hip fracture diagnosis on costs. RESULTS: Elective THA patients had lower EOC ($18,200 vs $42,605 vs $38,371; P < .001) and postacute care costs ($4477 vs $28,093 vs $23,217; P < .001) than both hemiarthroplasty and THA for fracture. Patients undergoing arthroplasty for fracture lost an average of $23,122 (vs $1648 profit for elective THA; P < .001) with 91% of cases exceeding the target price (vs 20% for elective THA; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, patients undergoing arthroplasty for fracture had higher EOC costs by $19,492 (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing arthroplasty for fracture cost over twice as much as elective THA patients. CMS should change their methodology or exclude fracture patients from BPCI, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Skibicki, Hope; Yayac, Michael; Krueger, Chad A; Courtney, P Maxwell",J. arthroplasty,55,14

This restriction resulted in a sudden change in people's lifestyle, leading to an increase in sedentary behavior and a related decrease in the practice of physical activity (PA). However, in neuromuscular diseases patients need to perform regular PA to counteract the negative consequences of the disease. Hence, the aim of this study was to estimate the levels of PA, measured as energy expenditure (MET-minute/week), among patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD) before and during the last week of quarantine. METHODS: A total of 268 Italian subjects, living in Sicily, completed an adapted version of the IPAQ-SF. Participants comprised 149 NMD, enrolled at the Neuromuscular Clinic of Palermo and 119 healthy subjects (control group). The SF-12 questionnaire was also administered to NMD. The Mann-Whitney U and the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum tests were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease of the total weekly PA level during COVID-19 quarantine in both patients and controls. Moreover, a significant difference in the total weekly PA level was found depending on the presence of neuromuscular disease, impaired walking, gender and BMI. Finally, we found a correlation between SF-12 scores and the entity of the reduction of PA level during quarantine, thus confirming a relevant association with the quality of life in NMD. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that COVID-19 quarantine has affected the practice of PA among both NMD and healthy controls.","Di Stefano, Vincenzo; Battaglia, Giuseppe; Giustino, Valerio; Gagliardo, Andrea; D039,; Aleo, Michele; Giannini, Ottavio; Palma, Antonio; Brighina, Filippo",J. neurol,55,7

Despite numerous studies indicating better staffing is associated with more favourable patient outcomes, only one US state (California) sets patient-to-nurse staffing standards. To inform staffing legislation actively under consideration in two other US states (New York, Illinois), we sought to determine whether staffing varies across hospitals and the consequences for patient outcomes. Coincidentally, data collection occurred just prior to the COVID-19 outbreak; thus, these data also provide a real-time example of the public health implications of chronic hospital nurse understaffing. METHODS: Survey data from nurses and patients in 254 hospitals in New York and Illinois between December 2019 and February 2020 document associations of nurse staffing with care quality, patient experiences and nurse burnout. RESULTS: Mean staffing in medical-surgical units varied from 3.3 to 9.7 patients per nurse, with the worst mean staffing in New York City. Over half the nurses in both states experienced high burnout. Half gave their hospitals unfavourable safety grades and two-thirds would not definitely recommend their hospitals. One-third of patients rated their hospitals less than excellent and would not definitely recommend it to others. After adjusting for confounding factors, each additional patient per nurse increased odds of nurses and per cent of patients giving unfavourable reports; ORs ranged from 1.15 to 1.52 for nurses on medical-surgical units and from 1.32 to 3.63 for nurses on intensive care units. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital nurses were burned out and working in understaffed conditions in the weeks prior to the first wave of COVID-19 cases, posing risks to the public's health. Such risks could be addressed by safe nurse staffing policies currently under consideration.","Lasater, Karen B; Aiken, Linda H; Sloane, Douglas M; French, Rachel; Martin, Brendan; Reneau, Kyrani; Alexander, Maryann; McHugh, Matthew D",BMJ qual. saf.

Indeed, high prevalence rates of depression, sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported in Chinese healthcare workers during the epidemic peak. Symptoms of psychological distress are expected to be long-lasting and have a systemic impact on healthcare systems, warranting the need for evidence-based psychological treatments aiming at relieving immediate stress and preventing the onset of psychological disorders in this population. In the current COVID-19 context, internet-based interventions have the potential to circumvent the pitfalls of face-to-face formats and provide the flexibility required to facilitate accessibility to healthcare workers. Online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in particular has proved to be effective in treating and preventing a number of stress-related disorders in populations other than healthcare workers. The aim of our randomized controlled trial study protocol is to evaluate the efficacy of the 'My Health too' CBT program-a program we have developed for healthcare workers facing the pandemic-on immediate perceived stress and on the emergence of psychiatric disorders at 3- and 6-month follow-up compared to an active control group (i.e., bibliotherapy). METHODS: Powered for superiority testing, this six-site open trial involves the random assignment of 120 healthcare workers with stress levels > 16 on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to either the 7-session online CBT program or bibliotherapy. The primary outcome is the decrease of PSS-10 scores at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes include depression, insomnia, and PTSD symptoms; self-reported resilience and rumination; and credibility and satisfaction. Assessments are scheduled at pretreatment, mid-treatment (at 4 weeks), end of active treatment (at 8 weeks), and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: This is the first study assessing the efficacy and the acceptability of a brief online CBT program specifically developed for healthcare workers. Given the potential short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers' mental health, but also on healthcare systems, our findings can significantly impact clinical practice and management of the ongoing, and probably long-lasting, health crisis.

The risk of a severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is increased in all but the mildest forms of NMDs. High-risk conditions include reduced airway clearance due to oropharyngeal weakness and risk of worsening with fever, fasting or infection Isolation requirements may have an impact on treatment regimens administered in hospital settings, such as nusinersen, glucosidase alfa, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab infusions. In addition, specific drugs for SARS-CoV2 infection under investigation impair neuromuscular function significantly; chloroquine and azithromycin are not recommended in myasthenia gravis without available ventilatory support and prolonged prone positioning may influence options for treatment. Other therapeutics may affect specific NMDs (metabolic, mitochondrial, myotonic diseases) and experimental approaches for Coronavirus disease 2019 may be offered ""compassionately"" only after consulting the patient's NMD specialist. In parallel, the reorganization of hospital and outpatient services may change the management of non-infected NMD patients and their caregivers, favouring at-distance approaches. However, the literature on the validation of telehealth in this subgroup of patients is scant. Thus, as the first wave of the pandemic is progressing, clinicians and researchers should address these crucial open issues to ensure adequate caring for NMD patients.

Despite this, handwashing behavior remains low in the general public. Social marketing has been employed as a successful health promotion strategy for changing many health behaviors in the past. The present study examines if message framing influences the effectiveness of a handwashing health promotion messages at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a between-subjects cross-sectional experiment, participants (N = 344) in the United States were randomly assigned to view one of four handwashing messages or a control message before completing self-report measures of attitudes, emotions, readiness to change, and behavioral intentions around handwashing. Simple handwashing messages were presented with different framings, including a simple exchange message, a gain message, a social norm appeal, and a guilt appeal. Results revealed that message type influenced handwashing behavioral intentions and emotions. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that the simple exchange message produced significantly higher intentions than other messages and that only the simple exchange message significantly differed from the control message on emotions regarding handwashing. Mediational analyses showed handwashing emotions fully mediated the relationship between messaging and handwashing intentions. This mediation effect was moderated by age, such that it occurred for the younger and middle age participants, but not older participants. These results suggest that even simple, brief, and easily conveyable messages can positively impact behavioral intentions around handwashing during the early stages of a health crisis. Consistent with recent research comparing affective and cognitive pathways for health behavior, the mediational analysis suggests that effect of the simple exchange message on intentions was due to increased positive emotions around handwashing.","Matkovic, John; Clemens, Kelly S; Faasse, Kate; Geers, Andrew L",Front Public Health,55,1

We investigated the effect of corticosteroid treatment on 90-day mortality and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in severe patients with COVID-19. METHODS: 294 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were recruited between December 30, 2019 and February 19, 2020. Logistic regression, Cox proportional-hazards model and marginal structural modeling (MSM) were applied to evaluate the associations between corticosteroid use and corresponding outcome variables. RESULTS: Out of the 294 critically ill patients affected by COVID-19, 183 (62.2%) received corticosteroids, with methylprednisolone as the most frequently administered corticosteroid (175 accounting for 96%). Of those treated with corticosteroids, 69.4% received corticosteroid prior to ICU admission. When adjustments and subgroup analysis were not performed, no significant associations between corticosteroids use and 90-day mortality or SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance were found. However, when stratified analysis based on corticosteroid initiation time was performed, there was a significant correlation between corticosteroid use (&#8804; 3 day after ICU admission) and 90-day mortality (logistic regression adjusted for baseline: OR 4.49, 95% CI 1.17-17.25, p = 0.025; Cox adjusted for baseline and time varying variables: HR 3.89, 95% CI 1.94-7.82, p < 0.001; MSM adjusted for baseline and time-dependent variants: OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.16-4.65, p = 0.017). No association was found between corticosteroid use and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance even after stratification by initiation time of corticosteroids and adjustments for confounding factors (corticosteroids use &#8804; 3 days initiation vs no corticosteroids use) using MSM were performed. CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of corticosteroid use (&#8804; 3 days after ICU admission) was associated with an increased 90-day mortality. Early use of methylprednisolone in the ICU is therefore not recommended in patients with severe COVID-19.","Li, Yiming; Meng, Qinghe; Rao, Xin; Wang, Binbin; Zhang, Xingguo; Dong, Fang; Yu, Tao; Li, Zhongyi; Feng, Huibin; Zhang, Jinpeng; Chen, Xiangyang; Li, Hunian; Cheng, Yi; Hong, Xiaoyang; Wang, Xiang; Yin, Yimei; Zhang, Zhongheng; Wang, Dawei",Crit Care,55,16

METHODS: A topical review of the recent literature on implicit bias describing its potential impact in key areas of pediatric health care within the context of COVID-19 was conducted. RESULTS: Pediatric provider implicit bias has been found to be similar to the general population and can negatively influence clinical decision-making and outcomes for marginalized youth and families, particularly under stressful conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Implicit bias can be mitigated through strategies proposed at the individual, institutional/organizational, educational, and scientific/research levels. CONCLUSIONS: The additional strain on provider resources, staff, and supplies created by COVID-19 may exacerbate providers' susceptibility to implicit bias and contribute to health disparities. Pediatric psychologists are encouraged to recognize implicit biases in themselves and colleagues and promote identified strategies to reduce the impact of implicit bias on perpetuating health disparities in marginalized youth and families.","Mulchan, Siddika S; Wakefield, Emily O; Santos, Melissa",J Pediatr Psychol,55,1

To meet learner needs and improve the likelihood of successful implementation and utilization, we assessed radiology trainee attitudes and experiences of podcasts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed an educational podcast, From the Viewbox, focused on evergreen themes and practical approaches to radiology. Content categories included Diagnostic Approach, Specific Imaging Diagnoses, Noninterpretive Skills, and Special Topics. We released and promoted episodes on multiple digital platforms. Radiology trainees were surveyed and data were analyzed to assess listener preferences and usage trends. RESULTS: Only 19% of our trainees had previously listened to a radiology podcast, yet 81% expressed interest in listening routinely. After initial release, 86% of trainees listened to the podcast and 62% listened routinely. Episodes gained the most plays immediately following release but retained and continued to attract more listeners. The most popular episode discussing COVID-19 diagnosis and imaging, emphasized the importance of selecting high yield content to match listener needs. Most trainees felt the podcast had ""very high"" or ""high"" value in educational value, accessibility, and time efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: From the Viewbox offers efficient and accessible audio-only learning modules that can be used independently or effectively paired with traditional resources to decrease barriers in radiology education and enhance learner productivity. Podcasting is an underutilized asynchronous remote learning tool that can help overcome current challenges of social distancing, and more importantly address the diverse preferences and needs of our learners.","Shiang, Tina; Cerniglia, Christopher; Lin, Hannah; Lo, Hao S",Clin Imaging,55,16

Evidence suggests that attentional control may protect those individuals with outcome-specific vulnerabilities from developing maladaptive psychological outcomes. In the present study, attentional control was examined as a moderator of the relation between COVID-19 stress and generalized anxiety symptoms in a community sample (N = 359 adults). As predicted, the relationship between COVID-19 stress and anxiety was moderated by attentional control. Specifically, as attentional control decreased, the strength of the association between COVID-19 stress and anxiety increased. The results suggest that, among those with higher levels of COVID-19 stress, attentional control may act as a protective factor against developing anxiety. It may be beneficial as a matter of standard public health guidance to recommend that the general public engages in activities that are known to improve attentional control and alleviate emotional distress (e.g., mindfulness-based techniques) at the outset of a pandemic or other global catastrophe to reduce the likelihood that prolonged event-related stress will lead to impairing anxiety.","Bardeen, Joseph R; Gorday, Julia Y; Clauss, Kate",Psychol Rep,55,0

In the absence of vaccines that provide complete protection against these viruses, viral surveillance can identify disease burden and target virus-specific preventative measures. Influenza infection, in particular, has significant adverse effects on force readiness. METHODS: We tracked the frequency of 16 respiratory viruses at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center tested for during routine patient care using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and rapid antigen testing. We collected data on the date and location of the testing, as well as the age of the individual tested from two consecutive respiratory viral seasons. RESULTS: During the first year of data compilation (2017-2018), 2556 tests were performed; 342 (13.4%) were positive for influenza A and 119 (4.7%) were positive for influenza B. After influenza, the most common families of viruses identified were rhino/enterovirus (490 [19.2%]). During the second year (2018-2019), 4,458 tests were run; 564 (12.7%) were positive for influenza A and 35 (0.79%) were positive for influenza B, while rhino/enterovirus was identified in 690 (15.4%). Influenza peaked early during the 2017-2018 season and later during the 2018-2019 season. Importantly, during the 2017-2018 season, the vaccine was less effective for the H3N2 strain circulating that year and viral surveillance quickly identified a hospital-specific outbreak and a larger disease burden. This was in contrast to the 2018-2019 vaccine which exhibited higher effectiveness for circulating strains. CONCLUSION: Our data highlight the seasonality of respiratory viruses with a focus on influenza. By tracking respiratory viruses in Department of Defense communities, we may be able to predict when influenza may cause the greatest burden for distinct organizational regions and prescribe with greater precision preventative protocols by location, as well as rapidly determine vaccine efficacy. Our current data suggest that when vaccine strains are mismatched, rapid upfront targeting of antivirals may be warranted, but when the vaccine strains are better matched, late season peaks of disease may indicate waning immunity and should be monitored.","Crouch, Elena; Gonzalez, Jonathan; Jacobs, Erin; Schaecher, Kurt; Kehl, Margaret; Ottolini, Martin; Malloy, Allison",Mil Med,55,16

Objective: This article reviews the authors' experience of providing remote neurointensive care, from a non-specialist ICU over a 16-month period. Material and Methods: 61 neuro consultations were provided for 56 patients admitted in remote ICU's, including five repeat consultations. Most teleconsultations were from three rural hospitals. The central command center has monitored remote patients with neurological conditions, in 23 ICUs. Results and Conclusions: Providing real-time virtual neuro intensive advice to ICU's in smaller cities even without dedicated neuro-intensive units is feasible in India. eNeuroIntensive care is particularly necessary in the current ""New Normal"" era.","Haranath, Sai P; Ganapathy, Krishnan; Kesavarapu, Subba R; Kuragayala, Swarna D",Neurol India,55,20

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique is the standard test for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which, however, requires complicated sample manipulation (e.g., RNA extraction) and is time-consuming. We previously demonstrated that clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) could precisely detect Human papillomavirus and somatic mutations of Epidermal growth factor receptor gene and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog gene in plasma. The objective of this study was to develop CRISPR as a rapid test for sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2. We first combined reverse transcription-isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification and CRSIPR to detect SARS-CoV-2 in genomic RNA of cells infected with the virus. The CRISPR assay with guide RNA against the M gene of SARS-CoV-2 had a sensitivity of 0.1 copies per µL for detection of the virus. We then used the CRSIPR assay to directly analyze raw SARS-CoV-2 samples. The CRISPR assay could sensitively detect SARS-CoV-2 in one hour without RNA extraction. This assay can be performed at a single temperature and with minimal equipment. The results were immediately visualized either by a UV light illuminator or paper strips. The diagnostic value of the test was confirmed in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Altogether, we have developed a rapid CRISPR test for sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Tsou, Jen-Hui; Liu, Hongjie; Stass, Sanford A; Jiang, Feng",,55,1

Here, we describe four different institutions' approaches to addressing the impact of curricular transformation on clerkships using an implementation science lens. Specifically, we explore four different approaches to managing the 'bulge' as classes overlap in clerkships Curriculum leaders at four medical schools report on managing the bulge of core clinical placements resulting from reducing the duration of the foundational sciences curriculum and calendar shifts for the respective clerkship curriculum. These changes, which occurred between 2014 and 2018, led to more students being enrolled in core clinical rotations at the same time than occurred previously. Schools provided respective metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of their bulge management technique. These data typically included number of students affected in each phase of their curricular transformation, performance on standardized examinations, and student and faculty feedback. Not all data were available from all schools, as some schools are still working through their 'bulge' or are affected by COVID-19. There is much to be learned about managing curricular transformations. Working on such endeavors in a learning collaborative such as the AMA Accelerating Change in Medical Education Initiative provided support and insights about how to survive, thrive and identifying lessons learned during curricular transformation.","Kraakevik, Jeff A; Beck Dallaghan, Gary L; Byerley, Julie S; Monrad, Seetha U; Davis, John A; Hammoud, Maya M; Grum, Cyril M; Carney, Patricia",Med Educ Online,55,21

Understanding why some patients suffering from COVID-19 are getting so sick, while others are not, has become an informal imperative for researchers and clinicians around the globe. The answer to this question would allow rationalizing the fear surrounding this pandemic. Understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 relies on an understanding of interplaying mechanisms, including SARS-CoV-2 virulence, human immune response, and complex inflammatory reactions with coagulation playing a major role. An interplay with bacterial co-infections, as well as the vascular system and microcirculation affected throughout the body should also be examined. More importantly, a compre-hensive understanding of pathological mechanisms of COVID-19 will increase the efficacy of therapy and decrease mortality.

Due to the limited detection facilities and medical resources, especially in developing countries, a large number of suspected cases can only receive common clinical diagnosis rather than more effective detections like Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests or CT scans. This motivates us to develop a quick screening method on suspected patients via common clinical diagnosis results. However, the diagnostic items of different patients may vary greatly and there is a huge variation in the dimension of the diagnosis data among different suspected patients, which makes it hard to process these indefinite dimension data via classical classification algorithms. To resolve this problem, we propose an Indefiniteness Elimination Network (IE-Net) to eliminate the influence of the varied dimensions and make predictions about the COVID-19 cases. The IENet is in an encoder-decoder framework fashion and an indefiniteness elimination operation is proposed to transfer the indefinite dimension feature into a fixed dimension feature. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on the public available COVID-19 Clinical Spectrum dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed indefiniteness elimination operation greatly improves the classification performance and the IE-Net achieves 94.80% accuracy and 92.79% recall for distinguishing COVID-19 cases from nonCOVID-19 cases with only common clinical diagnose data. We further compared our methods with 3 classical classification algorithms: random forest, gradient boosting and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Compared with traditional classification methods, the proposed IE-Net can bring at least 9.40% accuracy gains and 12.17% recall gains. To explore the specificity of each clinical test item, we further analyzed the possible relationship between each clinical test item and COVID-19. In general, we proposed a novel image complementary method for COVID-19 screening and will be of great help for areas where effective detections are not available.","Guo, Guangyu; Liu, Zhuoyan; Zhao, Shijie; Guo, Lei; Liu, Tianming",IEEE j. biomed. health inform.

Severely infected patients showed abnormal gray matter volumes, white matter diffusion, and cerebral blood flow compared with healthy controls and those with mild infection. The data remain associative rather than mechanistic, but correlations with systemic immune markers suggest effects of inflammation, hypercoagulation, or other aspects of disease severity. Mechanistic research is warranted. Given the lack of obvious neurological symptoms, neurocognitive assessments were not performed, but the findings suggest that such assessments may be warranted in severely affected patients, even without obvious symptoms. Further, studying CNS involvement of other disorders with overlapping pathophysiologies such as inflammation, coagulation, hypoxia, or direct viral infection may reveal the causes for COVID-19-related neuropathology.","Mahajan, Amit; Mason, Graeme F",J. clin. invest,55,13

Though mass vaccination will certainly help in reducing number of COVID-19 patients, an effective therapeutic measure must be available too. Intravenous remdesivir (RDV) was the first drug receiving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of COVID-19. However, in a pandemic like COVID-19, it is essential that drug formulations are readily available, affordable and convenient to administer to every patient around the globe. In this study, we have developed a Self-injectable extended release subcutaneous injection of Remdesivir (SelfExRem) for the treatment of COVID-19. As opposed to intravenous injection, extended release subcutaneous injection has the benefits of reducing face-to-face contact, minimizing hospitalization, reducing dosing frequency and reducing overall health care cost. SelfExRem was developed using a biodegradable polymer, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), dissolved in a biocompatible vehicle. Six different batches were formulated using 2 different grades of low molecular weight PLGA and 3 different PLGA concentration. The force of injection of various polymeric solutions through 23-30-gauge needles were analyzed using a TA.XTplus texture analyzer. The time required for injection was evaluated both manually and by using an autoinjector. In vitro release of all the batches were carried out in 1% v/v tween 80 in phosphate buffer saline. The study indicated that SelfExRem developed with15% w/v PLGA(75:25) provided a steady release of drug for 48 h and may be a breakthrough approach for the treatment of COVID-19.","Patki, Manali; Palekar, Siddhant; Reznik, Sandra; Patel, Ketan",Int J Pharm,55,16

The pandemic's rapid evolution has resulted in a knowledge gap in how COVID-19 has affected MS clinical practice. Our objective was to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected clinical practice patterns in a nationwide cohort of MS clinicians across the United States. METHODS: In collaboration with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), we developed a 28-item SurveyMonkeyTM electronic questionnaire exploring MS specialists' perceptions of how COVID-19 has altered how they prescribe MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), provide telehealth and other services, and view issues affecting their own well-being including re-deployment to the front lines of COVID-19 care and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). NMSS staff sent a recruitment email containing the electronic survey link to 188 clinicians who serve on regional NMSS Healthcare Provider Councils across the US, 86 (45.7%) of whom were MS specialist physicians. RESULTS: Eighty-six of 188 potential respondents (45.7%) from 32 US states completed the survey including 45 physicians (41 neurologists, 3 physiatrists and 1 family physician), 18 rehabilitation therapists, 7 psychologists, 6 nurse practitioners, 4 social workers, 2 physician assistants, 2 nurses and 2 health professionals from other disciplines. More than 80% of all respondents working on-site in a health care setting believed they had adequate PPE. More than 41% were able to distance safely from others at work. Nearly 10% of respondents reported they had been re-deployed to the front lines of COVID-19 patient care, and an additional 16.9% anticipated being re-deployed. Among the MS specialist physician subgroup, nearly one-third reported using telemedicine to provide over 75% of their clinical care. Only 16.7% believed COVID-19 had not changed how they prescribe DMTs. Therapies prescribed more often during the pandemic included ß-IFNs (28.6% of prescribers), natalizumab (23.8%), glatiramer acetate (21.4%) and teriflunomide (19%). DMTs prescribed less often included alemtuzumab (64.3% of prescribers), cladribine (54.8%), ocrelizumab and rituximab (50%), and fingolimod and siponimod (40.5%). For at least some of their patients during the pandemic, some MS specialists reported suspending certain DMTs including alemtuzumab (21.4% of prescribers), ocrelizumab and rituximab (16.7%) and cladribine (11.9%). Others reported extending DMT dosing intervals for natalizumab (38.1%), fingolimod and siponimod (11.9%).

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is associated with LSCC and can impact its prognosis. Local factors, particularly pH, can affect cancer growth by altering TIME and tumor associated macrophages phenotype. However, it is still unknown whether and how LPR affects TIME and macrophages polarization in LSCC. In this study we compared macrophage polarization in LSCC of patients with and without coexisting LPR. Methods: A total of 63 patients with T1-2 LSCC without (the 1st group, 30 patients) and with coexisting LPR (the 2nd group, 33 patients) were enrolled in the study. Only HPV-negative cases of males were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry was performed to visualize CD68 and CD163 macrophages. The number of macrophages was counted at the central tumor clusters (TC), peritumor stroma (TS) and at the intact laryngeal mucosa (IM) taken from the tumor-negative edge. Results: Samples of the 2nd group patients with LSCC and LPR demonstrated significantly (P<0.05) higher inflammatory infiltration of all the evaluated compartments (TC, TS and IM). CD68+ cells count was comparable in TC and IM of the 1st and the 2nd group patients. In contrast, CD163+ cells were more numerous in the 2nd group patients in TC, TS and IM (P<0.001). Moreover, the number of M2 macrophages was significantly higher than M1 macrophages in patients with coexisting LPR. As a result, CD163/CD68 ratio was significantly (P<0.001) higher in LSCC with coexisting LPR. Conclusion: LPR is associated with altered macrophages polarization and increase of M2-type macrophages in LSCC. The shift in macrophage polarization towards the M2 type in patients with LPR could facilitate LSCC development and progression.","Zabolotnyi, Dmytro; Kizim, Yaroslav; Zabolotna, Diana; Sulaieva, Oksana; Kizim, Volodymyr",Clinical and experimental otorhinolaryngology,55,1

Wearing a mask can effectively reduce the probability of being infected by the virus. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor whether people wear masks in public to prevent the virus from spreading further. However, there is no mature general mask wearing detection algorithm. Based on tiny YOLOv3 algorithm, this paper realizes the detection of face with mask and face without mask, and proposes an improvement to the algorithm. First, the loss function of the bounding box regression is optimized, and the original loss function is optimized as the Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) loss. Second, the network structure is improved, the residual unit is introduced into the backbone to increase the depth of the network and the detection of two scales is expanded to three. Finally, the size of anchor boxes is clustered based on k -means algorithm. The experimental results on the constructed dataset show that, compared with the tiny YOLOv3 algorithm, the algorithm proposed in this paper improves the detection accuracy while maintaining high-speed inference ability.

Early reports suggested higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with type A blood and enrichment of type A individuals among COVID-19 mortalities. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The study includes all patients hospitalized or with an emergency department (ED) visit who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 10, 2020 and June 8, 2020 and had a positive test result by nucleic acid test (NAT) performed on a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. A total of 4968 patients met the study inclusion criteria, with a subsequent 23.1% (n = 1146/4968) all-cause mortality rate in the study cohort. To estimate overall risk by ABO type and account for the competing risks of in-hospital mortality and discharge, we calculated the cumulative incidence function (CIF) for each event. Cause-specific hazard ratios (csHRs) for in-hospital mortality and discharge were analyzed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Type A blood was associated with the increased cause-specific hazard of death among COVID-19 patients compared to type O (HR = 1.17, 1.02-1.33, p = .02) and type B (HR = 1.32,1.10-1.58, p = .003).

Feasibility tests include cell growth in the Matrigel as well as film dosimetric experiments that rule out the appearance of field inhomogeneities due to the presence of the well plate irregular structure. The response of CHO-K1 cells in Matrigel to radiation was studied by obtaining survival curves following X-ray and monoenergetic12C ion irradiation, which showed increased radioresistance of 3D cell cultures in Matrigel as compared to a monolayer. Finally, as a proof of concept, a12C treatment plan was optimized using in-house treatment planning system TRiP98 for uniform cell survival in a rectangular volume and employed to irradiate the 3D phantom. Cell survival distribution in the Matrigel-based phantom was analyzed and compared to cell survival in a reference setup using cell monolayers.

Although most patients with COVID-19 manifest fever and respiratory tract symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection may also involve other organs/systems and present with extra-respiratory manifestations, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, olfactory, gustatory, ocular, cutaneous and haematological symptoms. Occasionally, these extra-respiratory symptoms/signs represent the initial presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior to fever or respiratory manifestations. Therefore, this comprehensive review of the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 is intended to help clinicians better understand the range of clinical presentations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, allowing the consideration of COVID-19 in differential diagnoses. A screening test for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed when patients have these extra-respiratory manifestations. In addition, clinicians should be alerted to the adverse effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that can mimic the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19. Moreover, some extra-respiratory manifestations, such as ocular and gastrointestinal involvement, may be caused by direct invasion of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, protective measures should be taken while managing the associated clinical specimens. Finally, several extra-respiratory manifestations, such as cardiac involvement, acute kidney injury, coagulation disorders and thrombotic complications, could be associated with a poor prognosis.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Ko, Wen-Chien; Lee, Ping-Ing; Jean, Shio-Shin; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Int J Antimicrob Agents,55,19

Transmission by contact or at close range due to large respiratory droplets is widely accepted, however, the role of airborne transmission due to small respiratory droplets emitted by infected individuals (also asymptomatic) is controversial. It was suggested that outdoor airborne transmission could play a role in determining the differences observed in the spread rate. Concentrations of virus-laden aerosol are still poorly known and contrasting results are reported, especially for outdoor environments. Here we investigated outdoor concentrations and size distributions of virus-laden aerosol simultaneously collected during the pandemic, in May 2020, in northern (Veneto) and southern (Apulia) regions of Italy. The two regions exhibited significantly different prevalence of COVID-19. Genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 (RNA) was determined, using both real time RT-PCR and ddPCR, in air samples collected using PM10 samplers and cascade impactors able to separate 12 size ranges from nanoparticles (diameter D < 0.056 µm) up to coarse particles (D > 18 µm). Air samples tested negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 at both sites, viral particles concentrations were <0.8 copies m-3 in PM10 and <0.4 copies m-3 in each size range investigated. Outdoor air in residential and urban areas was generally not infectious and safe for the public in both northern and southern Italy, with the possible exclusion of very crowded sites. Therefore, it is likely that outdoor airborne transmission does not explain the difference in the spread of COVID-19 observed in the two Italian regions.","Chirizzi, D; Conte, M; Feltracco, M; Dinoi, A; Gregoris, E; Barbaro, E; La Bella, G; Ciccarese, G; La Salandra, G; Gambaro, A; Contini, D",Environ Int,55,6

This review addresses gaps in the literature regarding posttracheostomy care, emphasizing safety of multidisciplinary teams, coordinating complex care needs, and identifying and managing late complications of prolonged intubation and tracheostomy. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Scholar, institutional guidance documents. REVIEW METHODS: Literature through June 2020 on the care of patients with a tracheostomy was reviewed, including consensus statements, clinical practice guidelines, institutional guidance, and scientific literature on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 virology and immunology. Where data were lacking, expert opinions were aggregated and adjudicated to arrive at consensus recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Best practices in caring for patients after a tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic are multifaceted, encompassing precautions during aerosol-generating procedures; minimizing exposure risks to health care workers, caregivers, and patients; ensuring safe, timely tracheostomy care; and identifying and managing laryngotracheal injury, such as vocal fold injury, posterior glottic stenosis, and subglottic stenosis that may affect speech, swallowing, and airway protection. We present recommended approaches to tracheostomy care, outlining modifications to conventional algorithms, raising vigilance for heightened risks of bleeding or other complications, and offering recommendations for personal protective equipment, equipment, care protocols, and personnel. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Treatment of patients with a tracheostomy in the COVID-19 pandemic requires foresight and may rival procedural considerations in tracheostomy in their complexity. By considering patient-specific factors, mitigating transmission risks, optimizing the clinical environment, and detecting late manifestations of severe COVID-19, clinicians can ensure due vigilance and quality care.","Meister, Kara D; Pandian, Vinciya; Hillel, Alexander T; Walsh, Brian K; Brodsky, Martin B; Balakrishnan, Karthik; Best, Simon R; Chinn, Steven B; Cramer, John D; Graboyes, Evan M; McGrath, Brendan A; Rassekh, Christopher H; Bedwell, Joshua R; Brenner, Michael J",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,55,26

Early treatment modalities for severe respiratory failure during the pandemic focused on early intubation and invasive ventilation, as this was considered to be more effective than noninvasive respiratory strategies. However, emerging evidence proved that noninvasive respiratory supports such as noninvasive ventilation, high flow nasal cannula along with prone positioning might have a more significant and positive role than initially thought during the pandemic. Reflective evidence also suggests the utility of noninvasive respiratory supports as appropriate bridging adjuncts in the early stages of the disease process and has the potential to prevent intubation or invasive ventilation.

We hypothesized that elevated NLR would be a prognostic indicator of mortality. METHODS: This was a review of a prospective registry of adult (18+ years) hospitalized Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients from two large urban safety net hospitals in Louisiana. Blood cell counts at days 2 and 5 were used to obtain NLR. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis assessed predictive capacity of NLR on mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression models examined the effect of NLR on survival. RESULTS: The study population of 125 patients was majority African American (88.6%) and female (54.8%) with a mean age and body mass index of 58.7 years and 34.2. Most (96.0%) had comorbidities of which hypertension (72.0%), obesity (66.7%), and diabetes (40.0%) were the most common. Mortality was 18.4%. NLRâ>â4.94 on day 1 predicted intubation (Pâ=â0.02). NLR above established cutoff values on hospital days 2 and 5 each significantly predicted mortality (Pâ<â0.001 and Pâ=â0.002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: NLR is a prognostic factor for endotracheal intubation upon hospital admission and independent predictor for risk of mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients on subsequent hospital days. Clinical research efforts should examine effects of strategies such as arginase inhibition alone and/or inhaled nitric oxide to ameliorate the effects of elevated NLR.","Tatum, Danielle; Taghavi, Sharven; Houghton, August; Stover, Jacob; Toraih, Eman; Duchesne, Juan",Shock,55,1

Debriefing can help clinicians process these emotions, but the coronavirus pandemic makes it difficult to create a physically and psychologically safe space in the emergency department (ED) to perform this intervention. In response, we piloted a video-based debriefing program to support emergency clinician well-being. We report the details of our program and results of our evaluation of its acceptability and perceived value to emergency clinicians during the pandemic. METHODS: ED attending physicians, resident physicians, and non-physician practitioners (NPP) at our quaternary-care academic medical center were invited to participate in role-based, weekly one-hour facilitated debriefings using Zoom. ED attendings with experience in debriefing led each session and used an explorative approach that focused on empathy and normalizing reactions. At the end of the pilot, we distributed to participants an anonymous 10-point survey that included multiple-answer questions and visual analogue scales. RESULTS: We completed 18 debriefings with 68 unique participants (29 attending physicians, 6 resident physicians, and 33 NPPs. A total of 76% of participants responded to our survey and 77% of respondents participated in at least two debriefings. Emergency clinicians reported that the most common reasons to participate in the debriefings were ""to enhance my sense of community and connection"" (81%) followed by ""to support colleagues"" (75%). Debriefing with members of the same role group (92%) and the Zoom platform (81%) were considered to be helpful aspects of the debriefing structure. Although emergency clinicians found these sessions to be useful (78.8 +/- 17.6) interquartile range: 73-89), NPPs were less comfortable speaking up (58.5 +/- 23.6) than attending physicians (77.8 +/- 25.0) (p = < 0.008). CONCLUSION: Emergency clinicians participating in a video-based debriefing program during the coronavirus pandemic found it to be an acceptable and useful approach to support emotional well-being.

The underlying mechanism(s) for this association are unclear. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and COVID-negative controls to understand how PPI use may affect angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression and stool SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Analysis of a retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from March 15, 2020 to August 15, 2020 in 6 hospitals was performed to evaluate the association of PPI use and mortality. Covariates with clinical relevance to COVID-19 outcomes were included to determine predictors of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Control PPI users had higher salivary ACE2 mRNA levels than nonusers, 2.39 ± 1.15 vs 1.22 ± 0.92 (P = 0.02), respectively. Salivary ACE2 levels and stool SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection rates were comparable between users and nonusers of PPI. In 694 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (age = 58 years, 46% men, and 65% black), mortality rate in PPI users and nonusers was 30% (68/227) vs 12.1% (53/439), respectively. Predictors of mortality by logistic regression were PPI use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.72, P < 0.001), age (aOR = 1.66 per decade, P < 0.001), race (aOR = 3.03, P = 0.002), cancer (aOR = 2.22, P = 0.008), and diabetes (aOR = 1.95, P = 0.003). The PPI-associated mortality risk was higher in black patients (aOR = 4.16, 95% confidence interval: 2.28-7.59) than others (aOR = 1.62, 95% confidence interval: 0.82-3.19, P = 0.04 for interaction). DISCUSSION: COVID-negative PPI users had higher salivary ACE2 expression. PPI use was associated with increased mortality risk in patients with COVID-19, particularly African Americans.","Liu, Julia J; Sloan, Meredith E; Owings, Anna H; Figgins, Erika; Gauthier, Josee; Gharaibeh, Raad; Robinson, Tanya; Williams, Haley; Sindel, Campbell B; Backus, Fremel; Ayyalasomayajula, Krishna; Parker, Adam; Senitko, Michal; Abraham, George E; Claggett, Brian; Horwitz, Bruce H; Jobin, Christian; Adelman, Robert M; Diamond, Gill; Glover, Sarah C",Am. j. gastroenterol.

OBJECTIVE: To outline how known occupational health principles can be used for preventative management of the coronavirus in workplaces to support resumption of work. METHODS: A discussion of current knowledge of COVID-19, the cost of the lockdown strategy, and preventative biological cycle management. RESULTS: The evidence-based literature indicates that biological cycle management can control the risk of coronavirus infection, provide a suitable and sufficient exit strategy from lockdown, and support getting employees back to work. Adherence to personal protective equipment standards has been insufficient, indicating a need for workplace investment and education. CONCLUSION: Imposed restrictions on workplace operations can be lifted without compromising worker health and safety when a workplace commits to practicing the three principles of biological cycle management.","Jahangiri, Mehdi; Cousins, Rosanna; Gharibi, Vahid",Work,55,16

METHODS: Single-center retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the hospital with acute ischemic stroke, between December 1st, 2019 and June 30th, 2020. Outcomes were classified as none-to-minimal disability, moderate-to-severe disability, and death based on discharge disposition, and compared between two time periods: pre-COVID-19 era (December 1st, 2019 to March 11th, 2020) and COVID-19 era (March 12th to June 30th, 2020). We also performed a comparative trend analysis for the equivalent period between 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: Five hundred and seventy-five patients with a mean age (years±SD) of 68±16 were admitted from December 1st, 2019 to June 30th, 2020, with a clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke. Of these, 255 (44.3%) patients were admitted during the COVID-19 era. We observed a 22.1% and 39.5% decline in admission for acute ischemic stroke in April and May 2020, respectively. A significantly higher percentage of patients with acute ischemic stroke received intravenous thrombolysis during the COVID-19 era (pâ¯=â¯0.020). In patients with confirmed COVID-19, we found a higher percentage of older men with preexisting comorbidities such as hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus but a lower rate of atrial fibrillation. In addition, we found a treatment delay in both intravenous thrombolysis (median 94.5 min versus 38 min) and mechanical thrombectomy (median 244 min versus 86 min) in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. There were no differences in patients' disposition including home, short-term, and long-term facility (pâ¯=â¯0.60). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a reduction of hospital admissions in acute ischemic strokes and some delay in reperfusion therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Reddy recently anticipated the implication of circadian rhythm in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In addition to its key role in the regulation of biological functions, the circadian rhythm has been suggested as a regulator of viral infections. Specifically, the time of day of infection was found critical for illness progression, as has been reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. We analyzed circadian rhythm implication in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of isolated human monocytes, key actor cells in Covid-19 disease, from healthy subjects. The circadian gene expression of BMAL1 and CLOCK genes was investigated with q-RTPCR. Monocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus strain and viral infection was investigated by One-Step qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1ß and IL-10 levels were also measured in supernatants of infected monocytes. Using Cosinor analysis, we showed that BMAL1 and CLOCK transcripts exhibited circadian rhythm in monocytes with an acrophase and a bathyphase at Circadian Time (CT)6 and CT17. After 48 h, the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus increased in the monocyte infected at CT6 compared to CT17. The high virus amount at CT6 was associated with significant increased release in IL-6, IL-1ß and IL-10 compared to CT17. Our results suggest that time day of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects viral infection and host immune response. They support consideration of circadian rhythm in SARS-CoV-2 disease progression and we propose circadian rhythm as a novel target for managing viral progression.","Diallo, Aïssatou Bailo; Gay, Laetitia; Coiffard, Benjamin; Leone, Marc; Mezouar, Soraya; Mege, Jean-Louis",Microb Pathog,55,20

The study was carried out in an instructional software authoring tools course for instructional technology department students to develop academic achievement and instructional software design skills. To achieve this, augmented reality was used, which allowed the learning process to be completed via online distance learning. Forty students were selected to participate by purposeful sampling. The results show that augmented reality was more effective in supporting academic achievement as well as skills acquisition in the virtual classrooms compared to the virtual classrooms that did not use augmented reality in online distance learning. In general, augmented reality or one of its (fixed, animated) patterns can be used to effectively learn in online distance learning during pandemic periods. Also augmented reality that can use location-aware or vision-based may have a good potential in online distance learning within the pandemic. As such the teachers must be prepared to employ all patterns of augmented reality in traditional online distance learning or during the pandemics to achieve the need for 21st-century skills. Conducting more research is required in online distance learning by using augmented reality with another sample and different content general, augmented reality or one of its (fixed, animated) patterns can be used to effectively learn in online distance learning during pandemic periods.","Eldokhny, A.

In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students, to assess their anxiety level and their main anxiety sources related to this pandemic. METHODS: A Google Form was distributed to medical students using the virtual snowball sampling method. The form included the Beck Anxiety Inventory and additional 19 questions on sociodemographic characteristics, perceived level of knowledge about the epidemic, self-risk perceptions of COVID-19 and their anxiety levels about some other topics related to COVID-19. RESULTS: Overall, 3105 medical students with a mean age of 22.37 ± 2.46, took the survey. Amongst the participants, only 32% of the students defined their knowledge about the precautions that should be taken during an epidemic disease as acceptable. Students reported highest anxiety level for the continuing spread of COVID-19 in Turkey and transmitting coronavirus to another person. Clinically significant anxiety prevalence was 23.2%. Regression analysis revealed that factors that increased the risk of being anxious included being female, being other than a 5th-year student, thinking that being a medical student would increase the risk of coronavirus transmission or being uncertain about it, being exposed to a patient with COVID-19 or being uncertain about it, being anxious about the continuing spread of COVID-19 in Turkey, being anxious about acquiring COVID-19, being anxious for graduating and being on active duty, being anxious about a medical training interruption. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that anxiety is prevalent amongst Turkish medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic and they have a weak preparedness for a pandemic such as COVID-19. Based on our results, new strategies should be implemented for medical education and for alleviating students' anxiety levels.","Kuman Tunçel, Özlem; Tasbakan, Selin Ece; Gökengin, Deniz; Erdem, Hüseyin Aytaç; Yamazhan, Tansu; Sipahi, Oguz Resat; Pullukçu, Hüsnü; Önen Sertöz, Özen; Isikgöz Tasbakan, Meltem",Int J Clin Pract,55,1

Derangements in nutritional status, both for obesity and malnutrition, are relevant for the clinical outcome in acute illness. Systemic inflammation, immune system impairment, sarcopenia, and preexisting associated conditions, such as respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases related to obesity, could act as crucial factors linking nutritional status and the course and outcome of COVID-19. Nevertheless, vitamins and trace elements play an essential role in modulating immune response and inflammatory status. Overall, evaluation of the patient's nutritional status is not negligible for its implications on susceptibility, course, severity, and responsiveness to therapies, in order to perform a tailored nutritional intervention as an integral part of the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

To achieve this goal this paper uses empirical data obtained from infographics printed in The New York Times (NYT) and Folha de S.Paulo newspapers on the covid-19 pandemic. This was chosen because the objective data in numbers and figures affect how true opinion is shaped and the infographics were recurrently employed (during our research period) by all media as an effective mechanism for understanding the facts.

Our analysis reveals that COVID-19 gripped the nation during this time as is evidenced by the significant number of trending hashtags. With infections soaring rapidly, users took to Twitter asking people to self isolate and quarantine themselves. Users also demanded closure of schools, bars, and restaurants as well as lockdown of cities and states. The communications reveal the ensuing panic buying and the unavailability of some essential goods, in particular toilet paper. We also observe users express their frustration in their communications as the virus spread continued. We methodically collect a total of 530,206 tweets by identifying and tracking trending COVID-related hashtags. We then group the hashtags into six main categories, namely 1) General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) Panic Buying, 4) School Closures, 5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope, and study the temporal evolution of tweets in these hashtags. We conduct a linguistic analysis of words common to all the hashtag groups and specific to each hashtag group.

Secured medical image transmission requires adequate techniques for protecting patient privacy. This study aims at encrypting Coronavirus (COVID-19) images of Computed Tomography (CT) chest scan into cipherimages for secure real-world data transmission of infected patients. Provably safe pseudo-random generators are used for the production of a ""key-stream"" to achieve high privacy of patient data. The Blum Blum Shub (BBS) generator is a powerful generator of pseudo-random bit-strings. In this article, a hashing version of BBS, namely Hash-BBS (HBBS) generator, is presented to exploit the benefits of a hash function to reinforce the integrity of extracted binary sequences for creating multiple key-streams. The NIST-test-suite has been used to analyze and verify the statistical properties of resulted key bit-strings of all tested operations. The obtained bit-strings showed good randomness properties; consequently, uniform distributed binary sequence was achieved over the key length. Based on the obtained key-streams, an encryption scheme of four COVID-19 CT-images is proposed and designed to attain a high grade of confidentiality and integrity in transmission of medical data. In addition, a comprehensive performance analysis was done using different evaluation metrics. The evaluation results of this study demonstrated that the proposed key-stream generator outperforms the other security methods of previous studies. Therefore, it can be successfully applied to satisfy security requirements of transmitting CT-images for COVID-19 patients.","Reyad, Omar; Karar, Mohamed Esmail",Arab J Sci Eng,55,20

NORAD was highly expressed in A549/DDP cells compared with A549 cells. The MTT data showed that knockdown of NORAD enhanced the inhibition rate of cisplatin on the A549/DDP cells and decreased IC50 value. The colony formation and MTT assay suggested that cisplatin inhibited cell proliferation, and knockdown of NORAD enhanced the inhibitory effect of cisplatin on A549/DDP cells. Besides, we found that NORAD silence reduced the P-gp expression but not BCRP, LRP and MRP. Moreover, NORAD could directly bind to miR-202-5p, and ABCB1 was a target of miR-202-5p. The MTT assay found that miR-202-5p inhibitor reversed the effects of NORAD silence on cisplatin resistance of A549/DDP cells. Then, the Western blot data showed that knockdown of NORAD reduced P-gp expression, and miR-202-5p inhibitor enhanced P-gp expression. ABCB1 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of NORAD knockdown on A549/DDP cells. Moreover, NORAD could directly bind to miR-202-5p, and ABCB1 was a target of miR-202-5p. Inhibition of miR-202-5p and overexpression of ABCB1 eliminated the effects of NORAD silence on cisplatin resistance of A549/DDP cells. Overexpression of miR-202-5p suppressed P-gp expression in A549/DDP cells.

To date, no children younger than 12 years have been enrolled in clinical trials. Key challenges and knowledge gaps that must be addressed include (1) rationale for vaccines in children, (2) possible effects of immune maturation during childhood, (3) ethical concerns, (4) unique needs of children with developmental disorders and chronic conditions, (5) health inequities, and (6) vaccine hesitancy. Because COVID-19 is minimally symptomatic in the vast majority of children, a higher acceptable risk threshold is required when evaluating pediatric clinical trials. Profound differences in innate and adaptive immunity during childhood and adolescence are known to affect vaccine responsiveness for a variety of childhood diseases. COVID-19 and the accompanying social disruption, such as the school shutdowns, has been disproportionately damaging to minority and low-income children. In this commentary, we briefly address each of these key issues, specify research gaps, and suggest a broader learning health system approach to accelerate testing and clinical trial development for an ethical and effective strategy to implement a pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as rapidly and safely as possible. IMPACT: As the US begins an unprecedented implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, substantial knowledge gaps have yet to be addressed regarding vaccinations in the pediatric population. Maturational changes in the immune system during childhood have influenced the effectiveness of pediatric vaccines for other diseases and conditions, and could affect SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responsiveness in children. Given that COVID-19 disease is far milder in the majority of children than in adults, the risk-benefit of a pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine must be carefully weighed. The needs of children with developmental disabilities and with chronic disease must be addressed. Minority and low-income children have been disproportionately adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; care must be taken to address issues of health equity regarding pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials and allocation. Research and strategies to address general vaccine hesitancy in communities must be addressed in the context of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Cooper, Dan M; Afghani, Behnoush; Byington, Carrie L; Cunningham, Coleen K; Golub, Sidney; Lu, Kim D; Radom-Aizik, Shlomit; Ross, Lainie Friedman; Singh, Jasjit; Smoyer, William E; Lucas, Candice Taylor; Tunney, Jessica; Zaldivar, Frank; Ulloa, Erlinda R",Pediatr. res,55,1

The main clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19, coronavirus disease-2019) is pneumonia, but several cardiovascular complications may also occur (e.g., acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, stroke, arrhythmias, heart failure and cardiogenic shock). Direct or indirect mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2 could be implicated in the pathogenesis of these events.

METHODS: Device scoping required minimal interference with vaginal drainage, no constant pressure on any single point of the vaginal mucosa and minimal footprint on the vaginal floor. A polycarbonate prototype was developed consisting of a central cargo space to house sensors and battery, with a separate retention module. Mathematical modelling informed the required length and flexibility of the arms on the retention module to reduce pressure necrosis and inflammation within the vagina. The prototype was initially trialled, with a loaded cargo pod, for 4 weeks in five non-pregnant cows. Cows were monitored for signs of systemic infection and inflammation by collecting blood samples for haematology and acute phase inflammatory proteins. Cows were also assessed for general demeanour, signs of discomfort and positioning of the device. Later, the device was inserted into 20 early pregnant cows, with 20 contemporary, untreated controls. Cows were monitored, as in the initial trial, every 4 weeks for the next 5 to 6 months until calving. RESULTS: In Trial 1, there was 100% retention with no adverse effects. In Trial 2, device retention was 75% until calving with no adverse effects on cow health or pregnancy.

This research will begin to examine the relative influence of relevant psychological, social, and situational factors on intent to engage with a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine among key workers and non-key workers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: The study utilized a sample of UK adults who completed the 1-month follow-up of The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study during April/May 2020 and indicated having not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 (key workers n = 584; not key workers n = 1,021). These groups were compared in relation to their intentions to vaccinate, perceived risk of infection, and symptom severity. Binary logistic regression was used to examine predictors of vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Overall, 74.2% of the sample (76.2% key workers, 73.1% non-key workers) indicated they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine in future. Key workers (in particular health and social care workers) had a higher perceived risk of becoming infected in the coming months. For key workers, being female and perceiving oneself as having relatively low infection risk in the next 6 months was associated with increased likelihood of vaccine hesitancy. For non-key workers, however, being aged 25-54, having a low or average income and not knowing someone diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of individuals willing to accept a vaccine is encouraging but there is much room for improvement. Given the unique predictors of vaccine hesitancy in each group, public health campaigns may benefit from targeted messaging.","Butter, Sarah; McGlinchey, Emily; Berry, Emma; Armour, Cherie",Br. j. health psychol,55,16

Better approaches of diagnostics and medical facilities have helped some countries recover early. Previous exposures to epidemics have imparted lessons to handle such a pandemic with a high level of preparedness. The World Health Organization (WHO) and national health authorities are taking great efforts via efficient and impactful interventions to contain the virus. Diagnostic tests such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction are increasingly being used to confirm the diagnosis because testing biological samples for the presence of the virus is the definitive method to identify the disease, analyze the risk for transmission, and determine whether someone has been cured or not. It is also important to screen asymptomatic individuals to get the exact overview of the virus spread. Antibody detection plays a pivotal role in diagnosis; however, using it at the wrong time yields negative results and conveys dissenting opinion about the tests. Although the scaling up of testing has been significant, overall testing has been limited by the availability of diagnostics. Rapid diagnoses and discontinuation of transmission are keys to ending this pandemic. Diagnostics manufacturers are developing test kits and distributing them to different countries. Therefore, more than 500 commercial test kits for molecular- and immunoassays, most with Emergency Use Authorization, are now becoming available in the market. In this review, we discuss the importance of diagnostics, approaches of different countries toward the epidemic, global testing situation, and lessons to countries at the start of the epidemic for better preparedness.","Ravichandran, Karthikeyan; Anbazhagan, Subbaiyan; Singh, Shiv Varan; Agri, Himani; Rupner, Ramkumar N.; Rajendran, Vinodh Kumar Obli; Dhama, Kuldeep; Singh, Bhoj Raj",J.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: General scientific and specific historical methods were used, and methods of related sciences were applied as well. The main methods of historical research included, in particular, historical analytical, chronological and comparative historical;methods of medical statistics, etc. The historiography of the issue was analyzed, unpublished archival materials, local press were studied. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Despite the progress made, mortality remained high in general, proving the public health system had to be reorganized. The death rate shocked the local community so much that the authorities had to apply an information blockade. Anti-epidemic components included explanatory work by priests and police, sanitary measures, measures on strict compliance with observation and quarantine, food supplies to the blocked city and free medicine dispensation, involvement of all available medical institutions, and the establishment of special temporary facilities, actual mobilization of medical personnel. It was impossible to act in the other way, because the treatment methods seemed to be ineffective, like today, under the COVID-19 pandemic. When the medical component is proved ineffective in fighting the epidemic, relatively effective administrative measures, tried and tested over the centuries reasonably seem to be useful, and this experience has not lost its relevance.","Robak, I.

On the other hand, influenza type A viruses are recognized to cause severe and fatal infections in children populations worldwide. This study is aimed to compare the clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza infections. METHODS: A retrospective study comprising 107 children hospitalized at Abha Maternity and Children Hospital, Southern region of Saudi Arabia, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza infections was carried out. A complete follow-up for all patients from the hospital admission until discharge or death was made. The clinical data and laboratory parameters for these patients were collected from the medical records of the hospital. RESULTS: Out of the total enrolled patients, 73 (68.2%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 34 (31.8%) were diagnosed with H1N1 influenza. The median age is 12 months for COVID-19 patients and 36 months for influenza patients. A relatively higher number of patients with influenza had a fever and respiratory symptoms than COVID-19 patients. In contrast, gastrointestinal symptoms were observed in a higher number of COVID-19 patients than in influenza patients. A statistically significant increase in white cell counts is noted in COVID-19 but not in influenza patients (P < 0.05). There are no obvious variations in the mean period of duration of hospitalization between COVID-19 and influenza patients. However, the total intensive care unit length of stay was longer for influenza compared to COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of children infected with COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza were noted and reported in this study. There were no significant variations in the severity of the symptomatology and laboratory findings between the two groups of patients. Significant differences between these patients in some hospitalization factors and diagnosis upon admission also were not observed. However, more severe clinical manifestations and serious consequences were observed among pediatric patients hospitalized with influenza infections than among those with COVID-19.","Asseri, Ali Alsuheel; Shati, Ayed A; Al-Qahtani, Saleh M; Alzaydani, Ibrahim A; Al-Jarie, Ahmed A; Alaliani, Mohammed J; Ali, Abdelwahid Saeed",World J Pediatr,55,24

These exogenous sources of variation, or natural experiments, are sometimes proposed as instrumental variables to examine the effects of a given exposure(s) on a given outcome(s). Previous epidemiological studies have applied this technique using famines, earthquakes, weather events, and previous pandemics as exogenous sources of variation for other exposures; interest in applying this technique using the current severe acute respiratory system coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is already documented. Yet, large-scale events like these likely have broad and complicated impacts on human health, which almost certainly violates the exclusion restriction assumption of instrumental variable analyses. We review the assumptions of instrumental variable analyses, highlight previous applications of this method with respect to natural experiments with broad impacts or ""shocks"", and discuss how these relate to our current observations of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While we encourage thorough investigation of the broad impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on human health, we caution against its widespread use as an instrumental variable to study other exposures of interest.","Dimitris, Michelle C; Platt, Robert W",Am. j. epidemiol,55,20

Tocilizumab and anakinra were included in the local protocol as an optional treatment in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This cohort study evaluated the effects of therapy with cytokine blocking agents on in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and admitted to intensive care unit. Methods: The association between therapy with tocilizumab or anakinra and in-hospital mortality was assessed in consecutive adult COVID-19 patients admitted to our ICU with moderate to severe ARDS. The association was evaluated by comparing patients who received to those who did not receive tocilizumab or anakinra and by using different multivariable Cox models adjusted for variables related to poor outcome, for the propensity to be treated with tocilizumab or anakinra and after patient matching. Results: Sixty-six patients who received immunotherapy (49 tocilizumab, 17 anakinra) and 28 patients who did not receive immunotherapy were included. The in-hospital crude mortality was 30,3% in treated patients and 50% in non-treated (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.56-1.05, p=0.069). The adjusted Cox model showed an association between therapy with immunotherapy and in-hospital mortality (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.83, p=0.015). This protective effect was further confirmed in the analysis adjusted for propensity score, in the propensity-matched cohort and in the cohort of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation within 2 hours after ICU admission. Conclusions: Although important limitations, our study showed that cytokine-blocking agents seem to be safe and to improve survival in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU with ARDS and the need for mechanical ventilation.","Coloretti, I.; Busani, S.; Biagioni, E.; Venturelli, S.; Munari, E.; Sita, M.; Dall039,; Ara, L.; Tosi, M.; Clini, E.; Tonelli, R.; Fantini, R.; Mussini, C.; Meschiari, M.; Guaraldi, G.; Cossarizza, A.; Alfano, G.; Girardis, M.; Andreotti, A.; Bondi, F.; Chierego, G.; Scotti, M.; Serio, L.; Ghirardini, A.; de Julis, S.; Donno, L.; Di Salvo, F.; Farinelli, C.; Rinaldi, L.; Cavazzuti, I.; Ghidoni, A.; Buono, A.; Ferrari, E.; Iseppi, D.; Ardito, A.

Other known coronaviruses show a strong pattern of seasonality, with the infection cases in humans being more prominent in winter. Although several plausible origins of such seasonal variability have been proposed, its mechanism is unclear. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne droplets ejected from the upper respiratory tract of the infected individuals. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for hours on surfaces. As such, the stability of viral particles both in liquid droplets as well as dried on surfaces is essential for infectivity. Here we have used atomic force microscopy to examine the structural stability of individual SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles at different temperatures. We demonstrate that even a mild temperature increase, commensurate with what is common for summer warming, leads to dramatic disruption of viral structural stability, especially when the heat is applied in the dry state. This is consistent with other existing non-mechanistic studies of viral infectivity, provides a single particle perspective on viral seasonality, and strengthens the case for a resurgence of COVID-19 in winter.","Sharma, A; Preece, B; Swann, H; Fan, X; McKenney, R J; Ori-McKenney, K M; Saffarian, S; Vershinin, M D",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,55,16

METHODS: Four breast radiologists from Brigham and Women's Hospital trained two general practitioner physicians and five nurses in Rwanda over 9 total weeks of in-person training and 20 months of remote mentorship using electronic image review with e-mailed feedback. Independently recorded assessments were compared to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of trainee assessments, with radiologist assessments as the gold standard. We compared performance in the first versus second half of the training. RESULTS: Trainees' performance on written knowledge assessments improved after training (57.7% versus 98.1% correct, P = .03). Mean sensitivity of trainee-performed ultrasound for identifying a solid breast mass was 90.6% (SD 4.2%) in the first half of the training (period 1) and 94.0% (SD 6.7%) in period 2 (P = .32). Mean specificity was 94.7% (SD 5.4%) in period 1 and 100.0% (SD 0) in period 2 (P = .10). Mean sensitivity for identifying a medium- or high-suspicion solid mass increased from 79.2% (SD 11.0%) in period 1 to 96.3% (SD 6.4%) in period 2 (P = .03). Specificity was 84.4% (SD 15.0%) in period 1 and 96.7% (SD 5.8%) in period 2 (P = .31). DISCUSSION: Nonradiologist clinicians (doctors and nurses) in a rural sub-Saharan African hospital built strong skills in diagnostic breast ultrasound over 23 months of combined in-person training and remote mentorship. The sensitivity of trainees' assessments in identifying masses concerning for malignancy improved after sustained mentorship. Assessment of impact on patient care and outcomes is ongoing.","Raza, Sughra; Frost, Elisabeth; Kwait, Dylan; Bowerson, Michyla; Rugema, Vestine; Hategekimana, Vedaste; Umwizerwa, Aline; Shabani, Kassim; Shulman, Lawrence; Lee, Yeonsoo Sara; Huang, Chuan-Chin; Mpunga, Tharcisse; Shyirambere, Cyprien; Vianney Dusengimana, Jean-Marie; Pace, Lydia E",J.

To understand the overall symptom burden in patients with post-acute COVID-19, we explored whether identifiable symptom clusters exist in a cohort of patients with post-acute COVID-19 and then examined whether these clusters are associated with quality of life impairments. Methods: In a prospective observational study of COVID-19 patients at a Covid-19 Recovery (CORE) clinic between June and December 2020 (eligible patients had either a positive COVID-19 PCR or IgG antibody test), we administered a modified revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment survey which assessed whether patients had 13 symptoms over the week prior to presentation to the clinic on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (most severe symptoms). We performed exploratory factor analysis to search for clustering of symptoms into factors and examined the relationship between these clusters and quality of life measures. Results: Across 127 adult patients treated at CORE (mean (standard deviation (SD) age 51.8 (14.0);73.2% were women. We found four symptom factors: emotional factor (including depression and anxiety), activity limiting factor (fatigue, sleepiness and shortness of breath), gastrointestinal symptom factor (nausea, appetite and taste changes) and pain factor (pain, neuropathy). The Cronbach's α for the individual factors ranged from 0.64-0.84. The emotional factor was associated with an increased odds of reporting worse emotional (Odds Ratio (95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) 1.9 (1.2-3.3) and worse cognitive health status (OR 4.9 (2.5-9.5);the activity limiting factor was associated with increase odds of worse physical health status (OR 4.5 (2.1-9.7);the gastrointestinal symptom factor was associated with increase odds of worse cognitive health status (OR 2.1 (1.1-4.2). Conclusions: We found four symptom factors in adult patients with post-acute COVID-19. There was strong internal correlation between the factors and the factors were associated with quality of life measures.

(Special Issue: Sport and the coronavirus crisis.),15.027566,3.717385,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is considered a widespread concern in global public health. Diagnoses of COVID-19 in some cases are necessary due to severe prognosis. In this study, epidemiologies, clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 were studied in Taleghani Hospital, Urmia, Iran. METHODS: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study carried out on 215 patients with COVID-19 during March and April 2020.. Approved COVID-19 case was considered as a person with a positive respiratory sample performed by at least one of two RT-PCR methods or genetic sequencing. ANOVA repeated measure, independent t-test and logistic regression were done. A P value less than of 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 50.93±17.92 years. Regarding gender, there were 91 females (42.3%) and 124 males (57.7%). The mean hospital stay, the temperature at admission, and onset of symptoms were 4.91±3.68 days, 37.40±0.96 0 C, and 5.88±4.80 days, respectively. Close contact with suspected people was found in 10.2 % of patients. Additionally, 44 patients (20.5%) were smokers. Shortness of breath and cough were found in 62.8 % and 49.3 % of patients. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were the most common comorbidities of patients. Regarding lung involvement, 33 patients (33%) were normal, most of the patients (n=71) had 5-25% involvement in their lung and a minority of patients (n=13) had a severe condition of 50-75% lung involvement. The association between smoking and mortality was tested using chi-square showing no significant difference (X2 :2.959, P=0.085). There was no significant difference between AST, ALT, ALP, total, direct Bilirubin, lung involvement, and suffering from fever (p>0.05). High Spo2 can increase the chance of recovery by 24% with each unit reduction. Kidney involvement increases the chance of death by about 80% (95% CI: 0.104-0.013). The odds ratio of spo2 for recovery of COVID-19 was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.014-1.528; P=0.037). Kaletra with odds ratio of 31.960 had the most highest effect on recovery following COVID-19 (P=0.043) CONCLUSION: COVID-19 involves different organs of the body with different severity. In the meantime, smoking was not a risk factor for the virus or associated with severe manifestations of the disease. Patients with high creatinine and CPK, pulmonary involvement above 25%, and hypoxemia had a higher mortality rate. Increase of Spo2 by 1% can improve the patients by 24%. The results indicated that Kaletra had the most highest effect on improvement following COVID-19.","Gharebaghi, Naser; Farshid, Saman; Boroofeh, Behdad; Nejadrahim, Rahim; Mousavi, Jalil; Dindarian, Sina; Mohamadi, Sedra",Int J Clin Pract,55,33

Recent Findings COVID-19 pandemic led to a surge in psychiatric morbidities, including psychosis. Various putative biological and psychosocial changes have been implicated in COVID-19-related psychosis. COVID-19 is a proinflammatory state. Alterations in immunological processes both as a direct consequence of infection or secondary to the hyperimmune response heuristically explain the etiopathogenesis of psychosis in the affected individual. The uses of immunosuppressant and immunomodulatory drugs may be the other moderators of a psychotic presentation in COVID-19 patients. Evidence to substantiate this hypothesis is still lacking however, which further studies should address. Because of its management implications, a better understanding of the involved immunological mechanisms becomes extremely important. Summary Evidence suggests a putative role of immunological alterations in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related psychosis. The immunological abnormalities are primarily attributed to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection, medications used, and stress.","Tripathy, Sarvodaya Singh Nitika Singh Amit Kar Sujita Kumar",Current behavioral neuroscience reports,55,24

The low socioeconomic standard group (LSS) included 51 humans, 30 females (F) and 21 males (M). The high socioeconomic standard group (HSS) included 55 subjects, 24 F and 31 M. Of the 30 LSSF, 6 were immunoglobulin M (IgM), 21 immunoglobulin G (IgG), and 6 double positive. Of the 21 LSSM, 5 were IgM, 12 IgG, and 5 double positive. Of the 24 HSSF, 6 were IgM, 11 IgG, and 5 double positive. Of the 31 HSSM, 6 were IgM, 14 IgG, and 4 double positive. Of the 51 LSS humans, 26 were symptomatic (S) and 25 asymptomatic (AS). Of the 26 S, 20 were IgG and 8 IgM/IgG double positive. Of the 25 AS, 13 were IgG and 3 IgM/IgG double positive. Of the 55 HSS humans, 38 were S and 17 AS. Of the 38S, 24 were IgG and 11 IgM positive of whom, 9 were double positive. Of the 17 AS, one was IgG and one IgM positive. The IgM prevalence was higher among the HSS humans. The IgG prevalence was significantly higher among the LSS humans. In the two different socioeconomic standards, the prevalence of either IgM or IgG was higher among F. An inverse correlation was observed between age and the anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibodies prevalence except for LSSF-IgG and LSSM-IgM. In conclusion, socioeconomic standard, gender, and age impact humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 with a clear heterogeneity in individualized responses to the infection in terms of symptoms.","Bahgat, Mahmoud M; Nadeem, Rola; Nasraa, Mohamed H; Awad, Mona A-E; Kamel, Solaf; Abd-Elshafy, Dina N",J. med. virol,55,29

The aim of this study was to quantify and describe the ADRs reported by J-ADEM team and to determine the clinical potential of this approach. The J-ADEM team consisted of medical students tasked with managing and reporting ADRs in hospitalized patients. All ADRs screened and reported by J-ADEM team were recorded anonymously, and categorized and analyzed descriptively. From August 2018 through January 2020, 209 patients on 2 wards in an academic hospital were screened for ADR events. The J-ADEM team reported 101 ADRs. Although most ADRs (67%) were first identified by healthcare professionals and then reported by the J-ADEM team, the team also reported an additional 33 not previously identified serious ADRs. In 10% of all reported ADRs, the J-ADEM team helped optimize ADR treatment. The ADR reports were largely well-documented (78%), and ADRs were classified as type A (66%), had a moderate or severe severity (85%), and were predominantly avoidable reactions (69%). This study shows that medical students are able to screen patients for ADRs, can identify previously undetected ADRs, and can help optimize ADR management. They significantly increased (by 300%) the number of ADR reports submitted, showing that J-ADEM team can make a valuable clinical contribution to hospital care.","Reumerman, Michael O; Tichelaar, Jelle; Richir, Milan C; van Agtmael, Michiel A",,55,16

PIM administration may result in iatrogenic disorders and adverse consequences may be attenuated by limiting PIM intake.Areas covered: The goal of this review article is to discuss the trends, risks, and concerns regarding PIM administration with focus on cardiovascular patients. To find data, we searched literature using electronic databases (Pubmed/Medline 1966-2021 and Web of Science 1975-2021). The data search terms were cardiovascular diseases, potentially inappropriate medication, potentially harmful drug-drug combination, potentially harmful drug-disease combination, drug interaction, deprescribing, and electronic health record.Expert opinion: Drugs for heart diseases are the most commonly prescribed medications in older individuals. Despite the availability of explicit and implicit PIM criteria, the incidence of PIM use in cardiovascular patients remains high ranging from 7 to 85% in different patient categories. Physician-induced disorders often occur when PIM is administered and adverse effects may be reduced by limiting PIM intake. Main strategies promising for addressing PIM use include deprescribing, implementation of systematic electronic records, pharmacist medication review, and collaboration among cardiologists, internists, geriatricians, clinical pharmacologists, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals as basis of multidisciplinary assessment teams.","Anfinogenova, Nina D; Trubacheva, Irina A; Popov, Sergey V; Efimova, Elena V; Ussov, Wladimir Y",Expert Opin Drug Saf,55,16

Little is known, however, about the feasibility, reliability, and validity of language samples when conducted via telepractice. Method Child language samples from parent-child play were recorded either in person in the laboratory or via video chat at home, using parents' preferred commercially available software on their own device. Samples were transcribed and analyzed using Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts software. Analyses compared measures between-subjects for 46 dyads who completed video chat language samples versus 16 who completed in-person samples; within-subjects analyses were conducted for a subset of 13 dyads who completed both types. Groups did not differ significantly on child age, sex, or socioeconomic status. Results The number of usable samples and percent of utterances with intelligible audio signal did not differ significantly for in-person versus video chat language samples. Child speech and language characteristics (including mean length of utterance, type-token ratio, number of different words, grammatical errors/omissions, and child speech intelligibility) did not differ significantly between in-person and video chat methods. This was the case for between-group analyses and within-child comparisons. Furthermore, transcription reliability (conducted on a subset of samples) was high and did not differ between in-person and video chat methods. Conclusions This study demonstrates that child language samples collected via video chat are largely comparable to in-person samples in terms of key speech and language measures. Best practices for maximizing data quality for using video chat language samples are provided.","Manning, Brittany L; Harpole, Alexandra; Harriott, Emily M; Postolowicz, Kamila; Norton, Elizabeth S",J Speech Lang Hear Res,55,22

This study is based on exploratory research and used interviews to collect primary data. Five themes were found: initial crisis response, operational expenses, health scare, marketing, and crisis impact. It is seen that crisis management was implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, where reactive strategies were key for survival. Immediate actions were taken and implementing change was seen as easier due to the small size of the company. Further, operational expenses were adjusted to the changed demand and a favourable reputation helped to rebuild customers’ trust, where marketing initiatives were seen as important to reach customers. Finally, the impact of COVID-19 can strengthen organisational efficiency when handled well. Research about the impact of COVID-19 on the hospitality industry is limited, therefore further research is recommended on the long-term crisis response and the crisis consequences as well as the attitude of owners and employees of the hospitality industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nanda van Leeuwen, Boomkamp Vermolen Nicole",Research in Hospitality Management,55,1

Many researchers have expressed their conclusions from different perspectives on various factors such as spatial changes, climate risks, preparedness, blood type, age and comorbidities that may be contributing to COVID-19 mortality rate. However, as the number of people coming to the hospital for COVID-19 treatment increases, the mortality rate is likely to increase due to the lack of medical facilities. In order to provide medical assistance in this situation, we need to consider not only the extent of the disease impact, but also other important factors. No method has yet been proposed to calculate the priority of patients taking into account all the factors. We have provided a solution to this in this research article. Based on eight key factors, we provide a way to determine priorities. In order to achieve the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method, we studied individuals with different results on all factors. The sigmoid function helps to easily construct factors at different levels. In addition, the Cobweb solution model allows us to see the potential of our proposed algorithm very clearly. Using the method we introduced, it is easier to sort high-risk individuals to low-risk individuals. This will make it easier to deal with problems that arise when the number of patients in hospitals continues to increase. It can reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 561 professionals (42.6% males, 26.9% &#8805; 50-year-old) compiled a specifically designed web questionnaire on characteristics of POC rapid tests. They were asked whether they would change daily practice and make clinical decisions according to POC tests. Multivariate odds ratios (aOR) for predictors of propensity towards the aforementioned behavioral outcomes were calculated through regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall, only 51.9% knew the official recommendations of the Italian Health Authorities for POC tests, while 26.0% of respondents considered POC tests for COVID-19 highly reliable. Still, 40.3% of respondents would change daily practice because of such tests, and 38.5% would make clinical decisions based of their results. Actual understanding of specificity and sensitivity of POC tests was not associated with assessed behavioral outcomes: main positive effectors were identified in perceived reliability and usefulness of rapid tests, acknowledging the existence of official recommendations, understanding the limited clinical implications of POC tests, and working as occupational physicians were characterized as negative effectors. Conclusions. Propensity of sampled professionals towards POC tests for COVID-19 was diffusely unsatisfying. While actual understanding of accuracy of such tests was not a main effector of propensity, previous experiences with other POC tests in daily practice, particularly among occupational physicians may have impaired overall acceptance of such instruments.","Riccò, Matteo; Ferraro, Pietro; Gualerzi, Giovanni; Ranzieri, Silvia; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Balzarini, Federica; Signorelli, Carlo",Acta Biomed,55,24

The purpose of this study was to gauge the success of virtual visits at an outpatient interventional radiology practice in Washington, DC and compare the demographics and types of conditions seen before and after the transition to telemedicine. Materials and Methods: In this IRB-approved retrospective study, appointments scheduled with interventional radiology at an academic tertiary care institution between April 1st, 2019 and July 15th, 2019 were compared with appointments scheduled during the same time frame in 2020. All appointments scheduled in 2019 were in-office visits while all appointments scheduled in 2020 were telemedicine visits. Charts were reviewed for sociodemographic characteristics, types of visits, diagnoses, comorbidities, and scheduled procedures. Descriptive statistics and Pearson’s chi-squared tests were used to compare appointments scheduled in 2019 and 2020. Results: Of 180 appointments, 66.6% (n = 100) were scheduled in 2019 and 44.4% (n = 80) were scheduled in 2020. There was no difference in age, age ranges, gender, race distribution, or insurance status between both groups. While a greater percentage of patients presented for oncology-related problems in 2020 than in 2019, the overall difference in presenting problems was not significant (P = 0.13). The percentage of follow-up patients rose from 44.0% in 2019 to 56.3% in 2020 (P = 0.10). Of all telemedicine encounters, 91.3% demonstrated success of establishing a two-way secure audio and video connection with patients. Conclusions: This interventional radiology department cared for similar demographics of patients and case types via telemedicine visits when compared to clinic visits of the same time frame in 2019. While limited by the small sample size, these results indicate that outpatient interventional radiology practices are amenable to transitioning to online-only visits with improved ability to perform longer term follow up.","El Shatanofy, M.; Gowda, N.; Kantharia, S.; Scher, D.; Sarin, S.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,55,16

Antiretrovirals (ARVs) might have a prophylactic role in these patients. The purpose of this study was to review the most recently published articles on the possible role of ARVs for pre- or postexposure prophylaxis against COVID-19. From June to October 2020, we searched scientific databases using specific key words to identify ongoing trials or articles published before October 2020 investigating any subgroups of ARVs for prophylaxis against COVID-19. Apart from molecular docking studies, in vitro, animal, and human studies are very limited for evaluating the prophylactic role of ARVs against severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. According to our findings, there is no definite evidence to support use of protease inhibitors for this purpose, despite the promising results of molecular studies and limited clinical evidence for ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, darunavir, and nelfinavir when used early in the course of the disease. Nucleotide/nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) also have shown binding affinity to main enzymes of SARS-CoV-2 in molecular, in vitro, and animal studies. NRTIs like tenofovir and emtricitabine might exhibit a prophylactic role against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, currently there is no evidence to justify the use of ARVs for prophylaxis against COVID-19.","Alavian, Golbarg; Kolahdouzan, Kasra; Mortezazadeh, Masoud; Torabi, Zahra Sadat",J. clin. pharmacol,55,1

Severe and critical cases are characterized by damage to the respiratory system, endothelial inflammation, and multiple organ failure triggered by an excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines, culminating in the high number of deaths all over the world. Sedentarism induces worse, continuous, and progressive consequences to health. On the other hand, physical activity provides benefits to health and improves low-grade systemic inflammation. The aim of this review is to elucidate the effects of physical activity in physical fitness, immune defense, and its contribution to mitigate the severe inflammatory response mediated by SARS-CoV-2. Physical exercise is an effective therapeutic strategy to mitigate the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this sense, studies have shown that acute physical exercise induces the production of myokines that are secreted in tissues and into the bloodstream, supporting its systemic modulatory effect. Therefore, maintaining physical activity influence balance the immune system and increases immune vigilance, and also might promote potent effects against the consequences of infectious diseases and chronic diseases associated with the development of severe forms of COVID-19. Protocols to maintain exercise practice are suggested and have been strongly established, such as home-based exercise (HBE) and outdoor-based exercise (OBE). In this regard, HBE might help to reduce levels of physical inactivity, bed rest, and sitting time, impacting on adherence to physical activity, promoting all the benefits related to exercise, and attracting patients in different stages of treatment for COVID-19. In parallel, OBE must improve health, but also prevent and mitigate COVID-19 severe outcomes in all populations. In conclusion, HBE or OBE models can be a potent strategy to mitigate the progress of infection, and a coadjutant therapy for COVID-19 at all ages and different chronic conditions.","Filgueira, Tayrine Ordonio; Castoldi, Angela; Santos, Lucas Eduardo R; de Amorim, Geraldo José; de Sousa Fernandes, Matheus Santos; Anastácio, Weydyson de Lima do Nascimento; Campos, Eduardo Zapaterra; Santos, Tony Meireles; Souto, Fabrício Oliveira",Front Immunol,55,30

Method: s A retrospective comparison of the pregnancy outcomes was done between 16 women with COVID-19 and 45 women without COVID-19. Also, the results of laboratory tests, imaging examinations, and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid test were performed in 10 cases of neonatal delivered from women with COVID-19. Result: s (1) Of the 16 pregnant women with COVID-19, 15 cases were ordinary type and 1 case was severe type. No one has progressed to critical pneumonia.The delivery method of the two groups was cesarean section, and the gestational age were (38.7±1.4) and (37.9±1.6) weeks,there was no significant difference between the two groups (P>0.05). Also, there wee no significant differences in the intraoperative blood loss and birth weight of the newborn between the two groups (all P>0.05). (2) Ten cases of neonates delivered from pregnant women with COVID-19 were collected. The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were all negative.There were no significant differences in fetal distress, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, preterm birth, and neonatal asphyxia between the two groups (all P>0.05).(3) In the treatment of uterine contraction fatigue, carbetocin or carboprost tromethamine was used more in cesarean section for pregnant women with COVID-19 (1.3±0.6), compared with Non-COVID-19 group (0.5±0.7),the difference was statistically significant (P=0.001). Conclusions: If there is an indication for obstetric surgery or critical illness of COVID-19 in pregnant women, timely termination of pregnancy will not increase the risk of premature birth and asphyxia of the newborn, but it is beneficial to the treatment and rehabilitation of maternal pneumonia.

To evaluate the level and persistence of NAbs induced by two inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in China. Methods and findingsSerum samples were collected from 1,335 people aged 18 and over who were vaccinated with COVID-19 inactivated vaccine in Peking University Peoples Hospital from January 19 to June 23, 2021, for detection of COVID-19 antibodies. The WHO standard of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs was detected. The coefficients of variation between the detection results and the true values of the NAbs detected by the WHO standard were all lower than the WHO international standard 3% after the dilution of the original and the dilution of the theoretical concentrations of 500 IU/mL, 250 IU/mL, 125 IU/mL, 72.5 IU/mL, 36.25 IU/mL and 18.125 IU/mL. On day 11-70, the positive rate of NAbs against COVID-19 was 82% to 100%; From day 71 to 332, the positive rate of NAbs decreased to 27%. The level of NAbs was significantly higher at 3-8 Weeks than at 0-3 Weeks. There was a high linear correlation between NAbs and IgG antibodies in 1335 vaccinated patients. NAbs levels were decreased in 31 of 38 people (81.6%) at two time points after the second dose of vaccine. There was no significant difference in age between the group with increased and decreased neutralizing antibody levels ({chi}2 =-0.034, P>0.05). The positive rate of NAbs in the two-dose vaccine group (77.3%) was significantly higher than that in the one-dose group (18.1%), with statistical difference ({chi}2=312.590, P<0.001). A total of 206 people who were 11-70 days after receiving the second dose were tested and divided into three groups: 18-40 years old, 41-60 years old and >60 years old. The positive rates of NAbs in three groups (18-40 years old, 41-60 years old and >60 years old) were 95.14%, 78.43% and 81.8%, respectively. The positive rate of NAbs was significantly higher in 18-40 years old than in 41-60 years old ({chi}2=12.547, P <0.01). The titer of NAbs in 18-40 years old group was significantly higher than that in 41-60 years old group (t=-0.222, P <0.01). The positive rate of NAbs in male group (89.32%) was lower than in female (91.26%), but there was no significant difference ({chi}2=0.222, P >0.05). ConclusionsThe positive rate of NAbs was the highest from 10 to 70 days after the second dose of vaccine, and the positive rate gradually decreased as time went by. There was a high linear correlation between COVID-19 NAbs and IgM/IgG antibodies in vaccinators, suggesting that in cases where NAbs cannot be detected, IgM/IgG antibodies can be detected instead. The level of NAbs produced after vaccination was affected by age, but not by gender. The highest levels of NAbs were produced between shots 21 to 56 days apart, suggesting that 21 to 56 days between shots is suitable for vaccination. Author summaryO_ST_ABSWhy was this study done?C_ST_ABSO_LIAt present, the inactivated vaccines that have been approved to market in China have passed clinical trials to prove their effectiveness and safety. But the level of neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccination in the real world remains unclear. C_LIO_LISerological testing for neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19 is important for assessing vaccine and treatment responses and comparing multiple drug candidates. We assessed the levels of neutralizing antibodies produced in populations receiving inactivated vaccines and assessed the persistence of these vaccines in producing COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies in healthy adults. C_LI What did the researchers do and find?O_LIWe collected serum samples from 1,335 people aged 18 and above who had received COVID-19 vaccine in Peking University Peoples Hospital, and divided them into two groups according to one dose of inactivated vaccine and two doses of inactivated vaccine. C_LIO_LIOur study found that the positive rate of NAbs was 66.2% in adults who received one or two doses of inactivated vaccine and 77.3% in adults who received two doses of inactivated vaccine in the real world. C_LIO_LIFrom 11 to 70 days after the second dose of vaccine, the positive rate of neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19 was 82-100%; On days 71-332, the positive rate of neutralizing antibodies decreased to 27%. C_LIO_LIThe titer and the positive rate of NAbs in 18-40 years old group were significantly higher than that in 41-60 years old group. C_LI What do these findings mean?O_LIWhat is novel is we observed that in the real world, the positive rate of neutralization antibody was the highest at 10 to 70 days after the second vaccination, and with the extension of the vaccination time, the positive rate of antibody gradually decreased. Therefore, we recommend that the third dose of vaccine be administered at day 61 to day 70 for COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies levels. C_LIO_LIWe observed that there was a high linear correlation between COVID-19 neutralization antibodies and COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibodies in vaccinators, suggesting that in cases where NAbs cannot be detected, COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibodies can be detected instead.

As a result of the pandemic, many older adults are now experiencing an increased and unprecedented amount of psychological stress. Physical activity has been found to be an evidence-based means of combating stress among older adults to promote their quality of life. Studies have demonstrated that those who are physically active experience fewer issues in regard to their mental health, specifically depression and anxiety disorders. Engagement in physical activity may exert a protective influence over stress inducing events and future mental health outcomes. Due to exercise being inexpensive, non-invasive, and effective even via incremental increases in activity level, physical activity interventions should be investigated as a therapy for reducing stress for older adults during the current pandemic. METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and SportDiscus) will be searched to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluate the effectiveness of physical activity or exercise programs as a psychological stress management tool in adults 50 years of age or older. Only peer-reviewed and published journal articles will be reviewed. Post-intervention psychological stress measures in comparison to baseline stress will be the primary outcome of interest. All studies will be assessed for bias using Cochrane's risk of bias tool. A random effects meta-analysis will be investigated if sufficient evidence of homogenous research exists and the heterogeneity of effect sizes will be tabulated. DISCUSSION: This review will determine the effectiveness of various physical activity interventions for the treatment of psychological stress among the older adult population. This knowledge will help inform care aides, clinicians, family members, and older adults themselves of the most effective physical activity interventions in dealing with stress which is relevant to the ongoing pandemic.

University students are additionally burdened by the transition to distance e-learning. The aims of the study were to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression in university students and to identify associated risk factors. DESIGN AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to 2,009 students in the University of Patras, Greece, during the national lockdown. Socio-demographic, academic data, and the forced disruption of daily life were assessed along with the Greek version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Anxiety and depression prevalence was 35.8% and 51.2% respectively. Age, school of study, financial status, self-perceived health status, level of satisfaction with the state's and university's response and specific aspects in the daily routine were associated with both anxiety and depression scores. At higher odds of both depression and anxiety were students with low income, bad health status, annoyed at staying home and those who encountered difficulties with the online education system. Additional risk factors for depression were studies in humanities and social sciences, and low satisfaction with the university's response, while for anxiety were studies in agricultural sciences and absence of information about COVID-19.

This paper draws from work on pathological life and disease ontology in arguing that the COVID-19 pandemic requires both a viral and a more-than-viral response. A pathogen-focused response on its own sustains illusions that this pandemic has a single origin point and an isolated local cause. A complementary relational response to the COVID-19 emergency would help challenge these illusions by attending to the social, ecological, and political circumstances in which the pandemic–and xenophobic and racist reactions to it–have taken place.","Klingberg, Travis",Eurasian Geogr.

Other viruses in the same phylogenetic group have been responsible for previous regional outbreaks, including SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin, similar to the causative viruses of these previous outbreaks. The repetitive introduction of animal viruses into human populations resulting in disease outbreaks suggests that similar future epidemics are inevitable. Therefore, understanding the molecular origin and ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 will provide critical insights for preparing for and preventing future outbreaks. A key feature of SARS-CoV-2 is its propensity for genetic recombination across host species boundaries. Consequently, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 harbors signatures of multiple recombination events, likely encompassing multiple species and broad geographic regions. Other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome show the impact of purifying selection. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which enables the virus to enter host cells, exhibits signatures of both purifying selection and ancestral recombination events, leading to an effective S protein capable of infecting human and many other mammalian cells. The global spread and explosive growth of the SARS-CoV-2 population (within human hosts) has contributed additional mutational variability into this genome, increasing opportunities for future recombination.","Singh, Devika; Yi, Soojin V",Exp Mol Med,55,24

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated the use of new technologies and new processes to care for hospitalized patients, including diabetes patients. The use of CGMs to automatically and remotely supplement or replace assisted monitoring of blood glucose by bedside nurses can decrease: the amount of necessary nursing exposure to COVID-19 patients with diabetes; the amount of time required for obtaining blood glucose measurements, and the amount of personal protective equipment necessary for interacting with patients during the blood glucose testing. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now exercising enforcement discretion and not objecting to certain factory-calibrated CGMs being used in a hospital setting, both to facilitate patient care and to obtain performance data that can be used for future regulatory submissions. CGMs can be used in the hospital to decrease the frequency of fingerstick point of care capillary blood glucose testing, decrease hyperglycemic episodes, and decrease hypoglycemic episodes. Most of the research on CGMs in the hospital has focused on their accuracy and only recently outcomes data has been reported. A hospital CGM program requires cooperation of physicians, bedside nurses, diabetes educators, and hospital administrators to appropriately select and manage patients. Processes for collecting, reviewing, storing, and responding to CGM data must be established for such a program to be successful. CGM technology is advancing and we expect that CGMs will be increasingly used in the hospital for patients with diabetes.","Perez-Guzman, M Citlalli; Shang, Trisha; Zhang, Jennifer Y; Jornsay, Donna; Klonoff, David C",Endocrinol Metab (Seoul),55,1

In these patients, we performed mycological culture in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for isolation of Aspergillus sp. We followed the AspICU algorithm to diagnose putative IPA. Moreover, we considered relevant the positivity of Galactomannan in BAL. We diagnosed putative IPA in 3 patients. The common features of these 3 patients were: more than 21 days of stay in ICU, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and treatment with steroids (1mg/kg per day).

Triage protocols have thus become necessary. Triage decisions in situations of scarce resources were not extraordinary in the pre-COVID-19 era; these protocols abounded in the context of organ transplantation. However, this prior experience was not considered during the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. Lacking national guidance or public coordination, each hospital has been forced to put forth independent and autonomous triage protocols, most of which were, nonetheless, based on common ethical principles and clinical criteria. However, controversial, non-clinical criteria have also been defended by Spanish scientific societies and public institutions, including setting an age cut-off value for unilaterally withholding ALS, using 'social utility' criteria, prioritising healthcare professionals or using 'first come, first served' policies. This paper describes the most common triage criteria used in the Spanish context during the COVID-19 epidemic. We will highlight our missed opportunities by comparing these criteria to those used in organ transplantation protocols.

In this paper, the game competition relationship is included in the evaluation model, and the game cross-efficiency model is used to measure the allocation efficiency of the rural public health resources in 31 provinces of China from 2008 to 2017. Then, the Theil index model and the Gini index model are applied in exploring the regional differences in the allocation efficiency of rural public health resources and its sources. Finally, the bootstrap truncated regression model is used to analyze the influencing factors of the allocation efficiency of the rural public health resources in China. The results show that, first, the total allocation efficiency level of the rural public health resources in China from 2008 to 2017 is relatively low, and it presents a U-shaped trend, first falling and then rising. Second, the changing trend of the allocation efficiency of the rural public health resources in the eastern, central, and western regions of China is similar to that in the nationwide region, and it shows a gradient trend that ""the allocation efficiency in the eastern region is high, the allocation efficiency in the western region is low, and the allocation efficiency in the Central region is at the medium level"". However, the gap among the three regions is continually narrowing. Third, the calculation results of the Theil index and the Gini index show that intra-regional differences are the major source of the regional differences in the allocation efficiency of the rural public health resources in China, and the inter-regional differences demonstrate an expansion trend. Finally, the improvement of the education level and the social support level will generally improve the allocation efficiency of the rural public health resources in China and its three regions. The increased governmental financial support and urbanization level will reduce the allocation efficiency of the rural public health resources in China and its three regions. The economic development level, the living conditions and the population density are the important influencing factors of the allocation efficiency differences of the rural public health resources in the three regions. Therefore, on the basis of ensuring the increase of the total supply of the rural public health resources, more attention should be paid to the improvement of the allocation efficiency. Moreover, on the basis of continually narrowing the inter-regional differences among the eastern, central, and western regions, more attention should be paid to the intra-regional differences of the allocation efficiency of the rural public health resources among the different provinces.

This study aimed to assess how individual and area socioeconomic position and geographical accessibility to healthcare services were associated with the time to diagnosis among symptomatic COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong. Multivariable generalized linear regression was used to estimate the associations while adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and case classification. This study found living in public rental housing and living in an area with low education were associated with longer time to diagnosis in the first wave of infections. Specifically, the risk of delayed diagnosis for public rental housing residents was mitigated by the higher density of public clinics/hospitals but was slightly increased by the higher density of private medical practitioners nearby. No such relations were found in the second wave of infections when the surveillance measures were enhanced. Given the grave impact of pandemics around the world, our findings call on taking inequalities into account when public health policies are being devised.","Wu, Yushan; Yan, Xiang; Zhao, Shi; Wang, Jingxuan; Ran, Jinjun; Dong, Dong; Wang, Maggie; Fung, Hong; Yeoh, Eng-Kiong; Chung, Roger Yat-Nork",Health Place,55,26

Evidence from other chronic conditions suggests persons at high risk for severe COVID-19 complications are foregoing care due to fear of contracting the virus. Persons with drug use disorders tend to fall into this high-risk category, and thus may be avoiding healthcare facilities. Our data suggest this is true. If so, adverse outcomes, and increased severity of use disorders and associated health complications, could become prevalent.

Oncology is the only field of medicine that is widely adopting such technologies, and even in this field uptake is irregular. There are practical and ethical reasons for this lack of translation of increasingly affordable techniques into the clinic. Undoubtedly, there will be increasing use of large data sets from traditional (e.g. tumor samples, patient genomics) and nontraditional (e.g. smartphone) sources.

SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells via the interaction of its spike protein with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. Since T lymphocytes display a very low expression level of hACE2, a novel receptor might be involved in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into T cells. The transmembrane glycoprotein CD147 is highly expressed by activated T lymphocytes, and was recently proposed as a probable route for SARS-CoV-2 invasion. To understand the molecular basis of the potential interaction of SARS-CoV-2 to CD147, we have investigated the binding of the viral spike protein to this receptor in-silico. The results showed that this binding is dominated by electrostatic interactions involving residues Arg403, Asn481, and the backbone of Gly502. The overall binding arrangement shows the CD147 C-terminal domain interacting with the spike external subdomain in the grove between the short antiparallel ß strands, ß1' and ß2', and the small helix &#945;1'. This proposed interaction was further confirmed using MD simulation and binding free energy calculation. These data contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 to T lymphocytes and could provide valuable insights for the rational design of adjuvant treatment for COVID-19.

METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional surveillance examining seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG amongst staff at University Hospitals of Leicester (UHL) NHS Trust. We quantified seroprevalence stratified by ethnicity, occupation and seniority of practitioner and used logistic regression to examine demographic and occupational factors associated with seropositivity. RESULTS: A total of 1148/10662 (10.8%) hospital staff members were seropositive. Compared to White staff (seroprevalence 9.1%), seroprevalence was higher in South Asian (12.3%) and Black (21.2%) staff. The occupations and department with the highest seroprevalence were nurses/healthcare assistants (13.7%) and the Emergency Department (ED)/Acute Medicine (17.5%), respectively. Seroprevalence decreased with seniority in medical/nursing practitioners. Minority ethnicity was associated with seropositivity on an adjusted analysis (South Asian: aOR 1.26; 95%CI: 1.07-1.49 and Black: 2.42; 1.90-3.09). Anaesthetics/ICU staff members were less likely to be seropositive than ED/Acute medicine staff (0.41; 0.27-0.61).

METHODS: A case-control study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital from March 1 to April 7, 2020. Health workers with suspected COVID-19 infection were included. The presence of COVID-19 was detected by using real-time-PCR methods. Positive and negative RT-PCR patients were used as case and control groups, respectively. This study analyzed the incidence of COVID-19 symptoms in both patient groups. Visual analog scales were used for self-assessment of smell and taste disorders, ranging from 0 (no perception) to 10 (excellent perception). RESULTS: There were 215 (60.6%) patients with positive RT-PCR and 140 (39.4%) patients with negative RT-PCR. The presence of symptoms such as hyposmia hypogeusia, dysthermia and cough were strongly associated with a positive RT-PCR. The association of cough and subjective hyposmia had 5.46 times higher odds of having a positive test. The ROC analysis showed that a fever higher than 37.45 °C, resulted in sensitivity and specificity of 0.65 and 0.61, respectively. A total of 138 cases (64.1%) and 114 cases (53%) had subjective hyposmia and hypogeusia respectively. The 85.4% of these patients recovered olfactory function within the first 14 days of the onset of the symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant association between positive PCR and subjective hyposmia. The association of subjective hyposmia and cough, increase significantly the odds of having a positive RT-PCR.

Bat virus RaTG13 and SARS-CoV are also members of the coronavirus family and SARS-CoV caused a world-wide pandemic in 2003. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and RaTG13 bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through their receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with a higher binding affinity than SARS-CoV and RaTG13. Here we performed molecular dynamics simulation of these binding complexes and calculated their binding free energies using a computational alanine scanning method. Our MD simulation and hotspot residue analysis showed that the lower binding affinity of SARS-CoV to ACE2 vs. SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 can be explained by different hotspot interactions in these two systems. We also found that the lower binding affinity of RaTG13 to ACE2 is mainly due to a mutated residue (D501) which resulted in a less favorable complex formation for binding. We also calculated an important mutation of N501Y in SARS-CoV-2 using both alanine scanning calculation and a thermodynamic integration (TI) method.

Hand washing technique is the rubbing together of all parts of the hands, including all the clefts using soap and water. Hand hygiene is the first step in preventing cross-transmission of microorganisms, which can help in prevention of Hospital Acquired Infections (HAIs). The entire world is in fact, emphasizing the importance of hand wash for the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic. The germs causing infection in a health care setting can be transmitted through contaminated hands. Health care-associated pathogens can be acquired from any source, mainly from infected or draining wounds, patients' skin, aprons they wear, mattresses they use, bedside furniture and other objects in the immediate environment of the patient. Organisms such as S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., Acinetobacter spp., Enterococci, play an important role in HAIs. Although hand hygiene procedures are relatively simple, several studies have mentioned that health care workers do not adhere to this properly. Poor hand hygiene compliance has been one of the leading contributory factors to Health Care Acquired Infections (HCAIs). Reasons for low hand hygiene adherence include location of sinks in an inconvenient place, tight work schedule, reluctance as well as lack of role models and not being aware of implementation guidelines. Aim: To analyze the awareness of hand hygiene among health care workers in a hospital set-up for infection control. The goal of the study is to get a better insight of and explore the knowledge and awareness on hand hygiene among health care workers in a tertiary care hospital.","Subbalakshmi, E.; Abirami, P.; Subramanian, V.; Sumitha, A.; Victor, H.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the number and the findings of stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-MPI performed between February and May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic at the University of Napoli Federico II. The number and the findings of stress SPECT-MPI studies acquired in the corresponding months of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 were also evaluated for direct comparison. RESULTS: The number of stress SPECT-MPI studies performed during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 123) was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) compared with the mean yearly number of procedures performed in the corresponding months of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 (n = 413). Yet, the percentage of abnormal stress SPECT-MPI studies was similar (P = 0.65) during the pandemic (36%) compared with the mean percentage value of the corresponding period of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 (34%). CONCLUSION: The number of stress SPECT-MPI studies was significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the corresponding months of the previous 3 years. The lack of difference in the prevalence of abnormal SPECT-MPI studies between the two study periods strongly suggests that many patients with potentially abnormal imaging test have been missed during the pandemic.","Nappi, Carmela; Megna, Rosario; Acampa, Wanda; Assante, Roberta; Zampella, Emilia; Gaudieri, Valeria; Mannarino, Teresa; Green, Roberta; Cantoni, Valeria; Petretta, Mario; Cuocolo, Alberto",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,55,24

It is necessary to understand public knowledge and behaviors if we are to effectively address the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that knowledge about COVID-19 influences participation in different behaviors including self-reports of purchasing more goods than usual, attending large gatherings, and using medical masks. METHODS: This study was funded and approved by the Institutional Review Board on March 17, 2020. The cross-sectional online survey of 1034 US residents aged 18 years or older was conducted on March 17, 2020. RESULTS: For every point increase in knowledge, the odds of participation in purchasing more goods (odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.95), attending large gatherings (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.93), and using medical masks (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.50-0.62) decreased by 12%, 13%, and 44%, respectively. Gen X and millennial participants had 56% and 76% higher odds, respectively, of increased purchasing behavior compared to baby boomers. The results suggest that there is a politicization of response recommendations. Democrats had 30% lower odds of attending large gatherings (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50-0.97) and 48% lower odds of using medical masks (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34-0.78) compared to Republicans. CONCLUSIONS: This survey is one of the first attempts to study determinants of knowledge and behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

METHODS: We included 424 patients with non-severe COVID-19 on admission from January 17, 2020, to February 17, 2020, in the primary cohort of this retrospective multicenter study. The extent of lung involvement was quantified on chest CT images by a deep learning-based framework. The composite endpoint was the occurrence of severe or critical COVID-19 or death during hospitalization. The optimal machine learning classifier and feature subset were selected for model construction. The performance was further tested in an external validation cohort consisting of 98 patients. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the prevalence of adverse outcomes (8.7% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.858) between the primary and validation cohorts. The machine learning method extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and optimal feature subset including lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), presence of comorbidity, CT lesion ratio (lesion%), and hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) were selected for model construction. The XGBoost classifier based on the optimal feature subset performed well for the prediction of developing adverse outcomes in the primary and validation cohorts, with AUCs of 0.959 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.936-0.976) and 0.953 (95% CI: 0.891-0.986), respectively. Furthermore, the XGBoost classifier also showed clinical usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: We presented a machine learning model that could be effectively used as a predictor of adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, opening up the possibility for patient stratification and treatment allocation. KEY POINTS: â¢ Developing an individually prognostic model for COVID-19 has the potential to allow efficient allocation of medical resources. â¢ We proposed a deep learning-based framework for accurate lung involvement quantification on chest CT images. â¢ Machine learning based on clinical and CT variables can facilitate the prediction of adverse outcomes of COVID-19.","Feng, Zhichao; Shen, Hui; Gao, Kai; Su, Jianpo; Yao, Shanhu; Liu, Qin; Yan, Zhimin; Duan, Junhong; Yi, Dali; Zhao, Huafei; Li, Huiling; Yu, Qizhi; Zhou, Wenming; Mao, Xiaowen; Ouyang, Xin; Mei, Ji; Zeng, Qiuhua; Williams, Lindy; Ma, Xiaoqian; Rong, Pengfei; Hu, Dewen; Wang, Wei",Eur. radiol,55,1

This result does not seem to be totally related to the differences in age distribution of different sites. CONCLUSIONS: The study does not seem to exclude that the lethality of COVID-19 may be climate sensitive. Future studies will have to confirm these clues, due to potential confounding factors, such as pollution, population age, and exposure to malaria.","Carta, M G; Scano, A; Lindert, J; Bonanno, S; Rinaldi, L; Fais, S; Orrù, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,55,30

The use of predictive models on the duration of the infections, or the number of deaths and recoveries can be not very effective over a long period of time. In a complex system, such as the network of human relationships that conveys the infections, everything can change within a few days or even hours following absolutely unpredictable social events that can lead to the emergence of new epidemic outbreaks. In these situations, it is much more important to analyze data to highlight any correlations between these and the adopted intervention measures. This important feedback can help to contain the spread of the pandemic by providing useful information to the competent authorities. In the literature there are various methods of analyzing data on infections to facilitate the preparation of an optimal intervention strategy. Social network analysis tools are often effectively used but they raise important doubts about respecting people’s privacy. Instead, this article intends to present a new model based exclusively on the analysis of the trend of the variation rates of new cases of COVID-19 in some Italian regions in order to identify important correlations between these and the governmental measures adopted to contain the epidemic spread. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Lella, L.; Licata, I.; Pristipino, C.","Future of Information and Communication Conference, FICC 2021",55,24

Indeed, many diseases and health problems experienced by zoo animals are found in, and frequently linked to, humans. Furthermore, the veterinary care they receive often incorporates knowledge, tools and treatments used in human health care. Here, we analyse these developments across the history of non-human primate health at the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZP), one of the oldest zoos in the United States. From NZP's opening in 1891, we distinguish five historical time periods within its first century based on how animal health was described, treated and understood. Concentrating on descriptions of primates in annual Smithsonian reports, we see notable changes in NZP activities focused on housing and environment (1889-1900), disease diagnosis and prevention (1901-1916), human-animal connections (1917-1940), research and collaboration (1941-1973) and conservation (1974-1989). We relate these shifts to concurrent medical events and trends in the United States, and interpret NZP's history in a broader scientific and societal context leading to a 'One Health' approach to animal care and welfare today.","Gutierrez, S.; Canington, S.

COVID-19 spread swiftly around the world over with an alert of an emergency for an adequate drug. Therefore, in this research, we repurposed the FDA-approved medicines to find the prominent drug used to cure the COVID infected patients. We performed homology modeling of the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), responsible for the viral entry. The prediction of the transmembrane region and the Conserved Domain in TMPRSS2 protein was made for docking. 4182 FDA-approved compounds from the ZINC database were downloaded and used for the calculation of physicochemical properties. Two thousand eight hundred fifteen screened compounds were used for molecular docking against the modelled protein structure. From which top hit compounds based on binding energy were extracted. At 1st site pose, ZINC3830554 showed the highest binding energy -12.91kcal/mol by forming Salt Bridge at LYS143, Hydrogen bond at ALA8, VAL45, HIS47, SER142, ASN277, ASN359, and TRP363.

The study aim was to investigate healthcare access among a group of international students studying in Ankara city and identify potential barriers that affect full healthcare utilization. METHOD: A total of 535 international students from 83 countries completed an online-based questionnaire. The survey was conducted from September until October 2020. Variables between groups within the study sample were compared using ANOVA and Chi-square tests (with Fisher's exact test). Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between variables related to access to health services. RESULTS: Of the study population, 80.6% accessed the general practitioner (GP), 40% accessed the student health centres, and 11.4% were admitted to the hospital at least once. About 80% of international students reported changing their views to access healthcare more because of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Lack of awareness of healthcare support systems, perceived stigma associated with mental health services, and language barriers were the main barriers affecting healthcare access by international students. IMPLICATIONS: Study findings indicate the need for education of international students on available healthcare, targeted health promotion, and training of health providers on effective communication.","Masai, Abednego Nzyuko; Güçiz-Dogan, Bahar; Ouma, Polet Njeri; Nyadera, Israel Nyaburi; Ruto, Victor Kipkoech",BMC Health Serv Res,55,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected daily information on implementation of 10 NPI designed to inform the public of health risks and promote distancing and mask use at the national level for eight countries across the Americas. We then analyse the adoption of the 10 policies across Brazil's 27 states over time, individually and using a composite index. We draw on this index to assess the timeliness and rigour of NPI implementation across the country, from the date of the first case, 26 February 2020. We also compile Google data on population mobility by state to describe changes in mobility throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Brazil's national NPI response was the least stringent among countries analysed. In the absence of a unified federal response to the pandemic, Brazilian state policy implementation was neither homogenous nor synchronised. The median NPI was no stay-at-home order, a recommendation to wear masks in public space but not a requirement, a full school closure and partial restrictions on businesses, public transportation, intrastate travel, interstate travel and international travel. These restrictions were implemented 45 days after the first case in each state, on average. Rondônia implemented the earliest and most rigorous policies, with school closures, business closures, information campaigns and restrictions on movement 24 days after the first case; Mato Grosso do Sul had the fewest, least stringent restrictions on movement, business operations and no mask recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: The study identifies wide variation in national-level NPI responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our focus on Brazil identifies subsequent variability in how and when states implemented NPI to contain COVID-19. States' NPIs and their scores on the composite policy index both align with the governors' political affiliations: opposition governors implemented earlier, more stringent sanitary measures than those supporting the Bolsonaro administration. A strong, unified national response to a pandemic is essential for keeping the population safe and disease-free, both at the outset of an outbreak and as communities begin to reopen. This national response should be aligned with state and municipal implementation of NPI, which we show is not the case in Brazil.","Touchton, Michael; Knaul, Felicia Marie; Arreola-Ornelas, Héctor; Porteny, Thalia; Sánchez, Mariano; Méndez, Oscar; Faganello, Marco; Edelson, Vaugh; Gygi, Benjamin; Hummel, Calla; Otero, Silvia; Insua, Jorge; Undurraga, Eduardo; Rosado, Julio Antonio",,55,26

However, it is unclear whether effects would hold in daily life during COVID-19, when people may have difficulty seeing a path towards their life goals. DESIGN: The current study investigated whether purposefulness predicted daily positive affect, negative affect, and physical symptoms. Participants (n = 831) reported on these variables during the first weeks of the COVID-19 response in North America. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed daily surveys asking them for daily positive events, stressors, positive affect, negative affect, physical symptoms, and purposefulness. RESULTS: Purposefulness at between- and within-person levels predicted less negative affect and physical symptoms, but more positive affect at the daily level. Between-person purposefulness interacted with positive events when predicting negative and positive affect, suggesting that purposeful people may be less reactive to positive events. However, between-person purposefulness also interacted with daily stressors, insofar that stressors predicted greater declines in positive affect for purposeful people. CONCLUSION: Being a purposeful person holds positive implications for daily health and well-being, even during the pandemic context. However, purposefulness may hold some consequences unique to the COVID-19 context, which merit attention in future research.","Hill, Patrick L; Klaiber, Patrick; Burrow, Anthony L; DeLongis, Anita; Sin, Nancy L",Psychol Health,55,16

The specific recognition of DNA modifications by the transcriptional protein machinery is thought to be a potential mechanism for epigenetic-driven gene regulation, and many modified DNA-specific binding proteins have been uncovered. However, the panoramic view of the roles of DNA modification readers at the proteome level remains largely unclear. Here, a recently developed concatenated tandem array of consensus transcription factor (TF) response elements (catTFREs) approach is employed to profile the binding activity of TFs at DNA modifications. Modified DNA-binding activity is quantified for 1039 TFs, representing 70% of the TFs in the human genome. Additionally, the modified DNA-binding activity of 600 TFs is monitored during the mouse brain development from the embryo to the adult stages. Readers of these DNA modifications are predicted, and the hierarchical networks between the transcriptional protein machinery and modified DNA are described. It is further demonstrated that ZNF24 and ZSCAN21 are potential readers of 5fC-modified DNA. This study provides a landscape of TF-DNA modification interactions that can be used to elucidate the epigenetic-related transcriptional regulation mechanisms under physiological conditions.","Bai, Lin; Yang, Guojian; Qin, Zhaoyu; Lyu, Jiacheng; Wang, Yunzhi; Feng, Jinwen; Liu, Mingwei; Gong, Tongqing; Li, Xianju; Li, Zhengyang; Li, Jixi; Qin, Jun; Yang, Wenjun; Ding, Chen",Adv Sci (Weinh),55,26

This article summarizes the potential benefits of erythropoietin (EPO) in alleviating SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis which is now called COVID-19. As with other coronavirus infection, the lethality of COVID-19 is associated with respiratory dysfunction due to overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the host immune responses. The resulting cytokine storm leads to the development of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). Erythropoietin, well known for its role in the regulation of erythropoiesis, may have protective effects against ALI/ARDS induced by viral and other pathogens. EPO exerts antiapoptotic and cytoprotective properties under various pathological conditions. With a high safety profile, EPO promotes the production of endothelial progenitor cells and reduce inflammatory processes through inhibition of the nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) and JAK-STAT3 signaling pathways. Thus, it may be considered as a safe drug candidate for COVID-19 patients if given at the early stage of the disease.

This protocol describes a surveillance program at the Africa Health Research Institute's Population Intervention Platform site in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The program leverages a longstanding HDSS in a rural, resource-limited setting with very high prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis to perform Covid-19 surveillance. Our primary aims include: describing the epidemiology of the Covid-19 epidemic in rural KwaZulu-Natal; determining the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and non-pharmaceutical control interventions (NPI) on behaviour and wellbeing; determining the impact of HIV and tuberculosis on Covid-19 susceptibility; and using collected data to support the local public-sector health response. The program involves telephone-based interviews with over 20,000 households every four months, plus a sub-study calling 750 households every two weeks. Each call asks a household representative how the epidemic and NPI are affecting the household and conducts a Covid-19 risk screen for all resident members. Any individuals screening positive are invited to a clinical screen, potential test and referral to necessary care - conducted in-person near their home following careful risk minimization procedures.

The purpose of this study was to understand the cost and benefit of adopting TG-CXR in quantifiable terms. METHODS: Portable or bedside radiographs are typically performed by a team of two technologists. The TG-CXR method has the benefit of allowing one technologist to stay outside of the patient room while operating the portable radiography machine, reducing PPE use, decreasing the frequency of radiography machine sanitization and decreasing technologists' exposures to potentially infectious patients. The cost of implementing this technique during the current COVID-19 pandemic was obtained from our department's operational database. The direct cost of routinely used PPE and sanitization materials and the cost of the time taken by the technologists to clean the machine was used to form a quantitative picture of the benefit associated with TG-CXR technique. RESULTS: Technologists were trained on the TG-CXR method during a 15 min shift change briefing. This translated to a one-time cost of $424.88 USD. There was an average reduction of portable radiography machine downtime of 4 min and 48 s per study. The benefit of adopting the TG-CXR technique was $9.87 USD per patient imaged.

513393,513393,513393,Shaping the future of healthcare: building back better,15.29488,4.0584464,2021,"BACKGROUND: As of 16 May 2020, more than 4.5 million cases and more than 300,000 deaths from disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported. Reliable estimates of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection are essential for understanding clinical prognosis, planning healthcare capacity, and epidemic forecasting. The case-fatality ratio (CFR), calculated from total numbers of reported cases and reported deaths, is the most commonly reported metric, but it can be a misleading measure of overall mortality. The objectives of this study were to (1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data and (2) infer estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for biases and examine the CFR, the symptomatic case-fatality ratio (sCFR), and the infection-fatality ratio (IFR) in different geographic locations. METHOD AND FINDINGS: We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases: preferential ascertainment of severe cases and right-censoring of mortality. We fitted the transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei Province, China, and applied the same model to six regions in Europe: Austria, Bavaria (Germany), Baden-Württemberg (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), Spain, and Switzerland. In Hubei, the baseline estimates were as follows: CFR 2.4% (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.1%-2.8%), sCFR 3.7% (3.2%-4.2%), and IFR 2.9% (2.4%-3.5%). Estimated measures of mortality changed over time. Across the six locations in Europe, estimates of CFR varied widely. Estimates of sCFR and IFR, adjusted for bias, were more similar to each other but still showed some degree of heterogeneity. Estimates of IFR ranged from 0.5% (95% CrI 0.4%-0.6%) in Switzerland to 1.4% (1.1%-1.6%) in Lombardy, Italy. In all locations, mortality increased with age. Among individuals 80 years or older, estimates of the IFR suggest that the proportion of all those infected with SARS-CoV-2 who will die ranges from 20% (95% CrI 16%-26%) in Switzerland to 34% (95% CrI 28%-40%) in Spain. A limitation of the model is that count data by date of onset are required, and these are not available in all countries. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a comprehensive solution to the estimation of SARS-Cov-2 mortality from surveillance data during outbreaks. The CFR is not a good predictor of overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2 and should not be used for evaluation of policy or comparison across settings. Geographic differences in IFR suggest that a single IFR should not be applied to all settings to estimate the total size of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in different countries. The sCFR and IFR, adjusted for right-censoring and preferential ascertainment of severe cases, are measures that can be used to improve and monitor clinical and public health strategies to reduce the deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hauser, Anthony; Counotte, Michel J; Margossian, Charles C; Konstantinoudis, Garyfallos; Low, Nicola; Althaus, Christian L; Riou, Julien",PLoS Med,55,1

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess work stress and associated factors among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak and to evaluate whether prior experience of treating severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had a positive or negative influence on healthcare workers' stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional survey in a tertiary hospital in Kaohsiung City, in southern Taiwan. METHODS: The survey was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire to measure the stress levels among healthcare workers from March 20 to April 20, 2020. The stress scales were divided into four subscales: worry of social isolation; discomfort caused by the protective equipment; difficulties and anxiety regarding infection control; and workload of caring for patients. RESULTS: The total stress scores were significantly higher among healthcare workers who were aged 41 or above, female, married, parents and nurses. Those with experience of treating SARS reported having significantly higher stress scores on the subscale measuring the discomfort caused by protective equipment and the workload of caring for patients. During the COVID-19 outbreak, frontline healthcare workers with experience of treating SARS indicated having higher stress levels regarding the workload of caring for patients than did non-frontline healthcare workers with no experience of treating SARS.

Akin to such reorganization efforts as creating patient-centered medical homes and primary care behavioral health integration, the WHS goes beyond by transforming the entire system to one that takes a proactive approach to support patient and employee health and wellness. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic disrupted the VA’s healthcare system and added stress for staff and patients, creating an exogenous shock for this transformation towards a WHS. Objective: We examined the relationship between VA’s WHS transformation and the pandemic to understand if transformation was sustained during crisis and contributed to VA’s response. Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted as part of a multi-year study of WHS transformation. A single multi-person interview was conducted with 61 WHS leaders at 18 VA Medical Centers, examining WH transformation and use during the pandemic. Data were analyzed using rapid directed content analysis. Results: While the pandemic initially slowed transformation efforts, sites intentionally embraced a WH approach to support patients and employees during this crisis. Efforts included conducting patient wellness calls, and, for patients and employees, promoting complementary and integrative health therapies, self-care, and WH concepts to combat stress and support wellbeing. A surge in virtual technology use facilitated innovative delivery of complementary and integrative therapies and promoted continued use of WH activities. Conclusion: The pandemic called attention to the need for healthcare systems to address the wellbeing of both patients and providers to sustain high quality care delivery. At a time of crisis, VA sites sustained WH transformation efforts, recognizing WH as one strategy to support patients and employees. This response indicates cultural transformation is taking hold, with WH serving as a promising approach for promoting wellbeing among patients and employees alike.","Dryden, E. M.; Bolton, R.

Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants show increased infectivity and may lead to resistance against immune responses of previously immunized individuals or existing therapeutics, especially antibody-based therapies. Several monoclonal antibody therapeutics authorized for emergency use or in development have been shown to lose potency against some SARS-CoV-2 variants. Cocktails of two different monoclonal antibodies constitute a promising approach to protect against novel emerging variants as long as both antibodies are potent, but come with increased development complexity and therefore cost. As an alternative, we developed two multispecific DARPin® therapeutics, each combining three independent DARPin® domains binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in one molecule, to potently neutralize the virus and overcome virus escape. Here, we show in a panel of in vitro studies that the multispecific DARPin® therapeutic design incorporated in our clinical candidate ensovibep (MP0420), achieved high neutralization potencies against the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK variant), B.1.351 (South African variant), P.1 (Brazilian variant), B.1.429 (South Californian variant), B.1.526 (New York variant), R.1 (Japanese variant), A.23.1 (Ugandan variant), and B.1.617 (Indian variant), and there is strong evidence that ensovibep also potently neutralizes the Indian variant B.1.618 based on the analysis of the key point mutations in the spike protein of this variant. Additionally, viral passaging experiments show potent protection by ensovibep and MP0423 against development of escape mutations. Finally, we demonstrate that the cooperative binding of the individual modules in a multispecific DARPin® antiviral is key for potent virus inhibition and protection from escape variants. These results, combined with the relatively small size and high production yields of DARPin® molecules, suggest that ensovibep is a highly valuable alternative to monoclonal antibody cocktails for global supply and demonstrate the strength of the DARPin® platform for achieving potent and lasting virus inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses.","Rothenberger, Sylvia; Walser, Marcel; Malvezzi, Francesca; Mayor, Jennifer; Ryter, Sarah; Moreno, Hector; Liechti, Nicole; Hälg, Silvan; Bosshart, Andreas; Iss, Chloe; Calabro, Valérie; Cornelius, Andreas; Hospodarsch, Tanja; Neculcea, Alexandra; Looser, Thamar; Herrup, Rachel; Lusvarghi, Sabrina; Neerukonda, Sabari Nath; Vassell, Russell; Wang, Wei; Mangold, Susanne; Reichen, Christian; Radom, Filip; Dawson, Keith M.; Lewis, Seth; Steiner, Daniel; Weiss, Carol D.; Amstutz, Patrick; Engler, Olivier; Stumpp, Michael T.",bioRxiv,55,16

However, the association of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced renal dysfunction with prognosis remains obscure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 154 patients with COVID-19 were recruited from the Second People’s Hospital of Fuyang City in Anhui, China. Demographic characteristics and laboratory data were extracted. Renal dysfunction was evaluated and its prognosis was followed up based on a retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: There were 125 (81.2%) mild and 29 (18.8%) severe cases in 154 COVID-19 patients. On admission, 16 (10.4%) subjects were accompanied with renal dysfunction. Serum creatinine and cystatin C were increased and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was decreased in severe patients compared with those in mild patients. Renal dysfunction was more prevalent in severe patients. Using multivariate logistic regression, we found that male gender, older age and hypertension were three importantly independent risk factors for renal dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Follow-up study found that at least one renal function marker of 3.33% patients remained abnormal in 2 weeks after discharge. CONCLUSION: Male elderly COVID-19 patients with hypertension elevates the risk of renal dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2-induced renal dysfunction are not fully recovered in 2 weeks after discharge.","Xiang, Hui-Xian; Fei, Jun; Xiang, Ying; Xu, Zheng; Zheng, Ling; Li, Xiu-Yong; Fu, Lin; Zhao, Hui",BMC Infect Dis,55,26

We tried to assess the impact of this form of lockdown on the daily number of positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, using interrupted time series analysis. We included the period of March 5 to April 17, 2021, as the period affected by the Friday lockdown, which was applied to seven consecutive Fridays with a total of 168 hours. We used R version 4.0.5 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) for our analysis. We used Poisson model regression analysis, where the number of positive cases was used as the outcome variable, while the total number of tests, time, and lockdown were used as the predictor variables. We further performed quasi-Poisson regression analysis to confirm the first model. On Poisson model regression analysis, it was found that there was an evidence of an increase in the number of positive COVID-19 cases following the intervention of Friday lockdown, with a p value of <0.001 (relative risk, 1.569; 95% confidence interval, 1.549-1.590). On using quasi-Poisson regression, similar results were found with a wider confidence interval. We concluded that a single weekend day lockdown led to an increase in the number of daily cases of COVID-19. Therefore, we recommend authorities to adhere to evidence-based measures or to the WHO recommendations in the dealing with this pandemic.","AlRyalat, Saif Aldeen; Elubous, Khaled A; Al-Ebous, Ali D; Mahafzah, Azmi",Cureus,55,16

We draw our conclusion from an analysis of transistor output characteristics, which avoids the known ambiguities of the common analysis based on transfer characteristics. Our findings contrast with reports on organic WGTFT biosensors claiming a purely capacitive response due to screening effects in high ionic strength electrolytes, but are consistent with prior work that clearly shows a potentiometric response even in strong electrolytes. We provide a detailed critique of prior WGTFT analysis and screening reasoning. Empirically, both potentiometric and capacitive responses can be modelled quantitatively by a Langmuir‒Freundlich (LF) law, which is mathematically equivalent to the Hill equation that is frequently used for biosensor response characteristics. However, potentiometric and capacitive model parameters disagree. Instead, the potentiometric response follows the Nikolsky-Eisenman law, treating the analyte ‘RBD spike protein’ as an ion carrying two elementary charges. These insights are uniquely possible thanks to the parallel presence of two response mechanisms, as well as their reliable delineation, as presented here.","AlQahtani, Hadi; Alswieleh, Abdullah; Al-Khurayyif, Ibrahim; AlGarni, Saad; Grell, Martin",Sensors (Basel),55,16

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of the GeneFinder(TM) COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit on the ELITe InGenius sample-to-result platform, which is a commercial nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) targeting genes of SARS-CoV-2. STUDY DESIGN: Patients were eligible between March 18 and May 27, 2020, when they had respiratory symptoms that were suspected for COVID-19. The InGenius platform was compared to routine in-house NAT that was validated according to the national reference. RESULTS: Of 128 randomly selected patients, 58 (45%) tested positive and 55 (43%) tested negative in both platforms. Sensitivity of the InGenius platform was 100% (95% confidence interval 94-100). In the remaining 15 (12%) cases E and RdRp genes were not detected in both platforms but the nucleoprotein (N) gene was tested positive by the InGenius platform. All solitary N gene positive cases were confirmed by a N-gene specific in-house validated NAT, and most of these patients could also be considered positive based on other recently available COVID-19 positive respiratory samples or highly suspected radiological findings. CONCLUSION: The InGenius platform for SARS-CoV-2 detection has excellent sensitivity, is easy to use and provides fast results. The inclusion of the N gene as a third gene target may further increase sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in comparison to the national reference method.","Ong, David S.Y.; Claas, Eric C.J.; Breijer, Simone; Vaessen, Norbert",J Clin Virol,55,1

Methods: A total of 38 patients with AIH under regular treatment at our hospital who provided their consent for being treated with polaprezinc (75 mg twice daily) were included and classified into 2 groups: the patients with zinc elevation (n = 27) and the patients without zinc elevation (n = 11). Serum biomarker of fibrosis, protein expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and their inhibitors (TIMPs) were evaluated. Results: A significant difference was found between the variability of serum procollagen type Ⅲ and collagen type Ⅳ-7S between the 2 groups before and after zinc administration for more than 24 months (p = 0.043 and p = 0.049). In the patients with zinc elevation, no significant changes were found in collagenase (MMP-1 and MMP-13) before and after zinc administration, whereas a significant increase in the expression of gelatinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) was found after administration (p = 0.021 and p = 0.005). As for the relative ratio of MMPs to TIMPs, only MMP-9 to TIMP-1 showed a significant increase (p = 0.004). Conclusions: Long-term treatment with polaprezinc has been demonstrated to safely improve serum fibrosis indices through increases in MMP-2/-9 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 and is expected to be well combined with direct antifibrotic therapies such as molecularly targeted agents.","Moriya, Kei; Nishimura, Norihisa; Namisaki, Tadashi; Takaya, Hiroaki; Sawada, Yasuhiko; Kawaratani, Hideto; Kaji, Kosuke; Shimozato, Naotaka; Sato, Shinya; Furukawa, Masanori; Douhara, Akitoshi; Akahane, Takemi; Mitoro, Akira; Yamao, Junichi; Yoshiji, Hitoshi",J Clin Med,55,3

BCV-specific recombinant plasmid probes p 52, p 27, and p 247, holding inserts derived from (probably nonstructural) genes, and plasmids pN 17 and pN 9 holding the N and M gene, respectively, permitted the detection of isolates of both BCV and TCV with similar sensitivities. Similarly, probing supernatants of cell cultures infected with several isolates of TCV, using probes pN 17 and pM 78, respectively holding the N gene of BCV and TCV, resulted in equally intense detection signals. Only a slight detection of MHV-3, which is antigenically related to BCV, was observed, whereas the probes did not allow the detection of IBV, TGEV, and HCV-229E, which are placed in antigenic groups separate from those of BCV and TCV. Detection of TCV was improved by hybridization with BCV-specific single-stranded (ss) probes holding sequences of the N and M genes and synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction. Diagnosis of TCV in 134 clinical samples by hybridization was better with PCR-produced ss BCV-specific probes than with ds PCR-produced probes or a combination of six recombinant plasmid probes holding non-overlapping BCV-specific cDNA sequences.

The Nrf2 pathway is believed to be a component of the anti-aging program responsible for the healthspan and longevity. Nrf2 enables stress adaptation by activating cell antioxidant defense and other metabolic processes via control of expression of over 200 target genes in response to various types of stress. The GSK3 system represents a “regulating valve” that controls fine oscillations in the Nrf2 level, unlike Keap1, which prevents significant changes in the Nrf2 content in the absence of oxidative stress and which is inactivated by the oxidative stress. Furthermore, GSK3 modifies core circadian clock proteins (Bmal1, Clock, Per, Cry, and Rev-erbα). Phosphorylation by GSK3 leads to the inactivation and degradation of circadian rhythm-activating proteins (Bmal1 and Clock) and vice versa to the activation and nuclear translocation of proteins suppressing circadian rhythms (Per and Rev-erbα) with the exception of Cry protein, which is likely to be implicated in the fine tuning of biological clock. Functionally, GSK3 appears to be one of the hubs in the cross-regulation of circadian rhythms and antioxidant defense. Here, we present the data on the crosstalk between the most powerful cell antioxidant mechanism, the Nrf2 system, and the biorhythm-regulating system in mammals, including the impact of GSK3 overexpression and knockout on the Nrf2 signaling. Understanding the interactions between the regulatory cascades linking homeostasis maintenance and cell response to oxidative stress will help in elucidating molecular mechanisms that underlie aging and longevity.","Shilovsky, Gregory A.; Putyatina, Tatyana S.; Morgunova, Galina V.; Seliverstov, Alexander V.; Ashapkin, Vasily V.; Sorokina, Elena V.; Markov, Alexander V.; Skulachev, Vladimir P.",Biochemistry (Mosc),55,20

In addition to being a two-way barrier to protect against virions droplets both in terms of “source control” (for the benefits of the community) and “physical protection” (for wearer), face masks also allow maintaining physiological temperatures and humidity of the nasal cavity and mouth, independently from the external environmental conditions. Beyond compromising the viral transmission speed, exposure to cold environments could have a detrimental effect on the host’s susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. The innate human immune system becomes in fact weaker with cooler nose temperatures and thus more vulnerable to viral replication. Furthermore, there is evidence that warm, humid climates are associated with reduced spread of SARS-CoV-2, while cold dry conditions favor its stability and transmissibility. In the early stage of a viral infection, a physiological body temperature in the upper airways supports the innate immune system, endorsing the muco-ciliary clearance, inhibiting, or deactivating any first settlement of viruses. Face masks are therefore strongly recommended also outdoors, especially under cold weather conditions, not only as a physical barrier against the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but also to prevent the rapid cooling of the nasal mucosa and the inhibition of the human innate defense of the upper airways.","Bubbico, Luciano; Mastrangelo, Giuseppe; Larese-Filon, Francesca; Basso, Paolo; Rigoli, Roberto; Maurelli, Martina; Ferlito, Salvatore; Capelli, Marco; Gisabella, Claudio; Javanbakht, Mohammad; Bellizzi, Saverio; Cegolon, Luca",Int J Environ Res Public Health,55,16

Il survient le souvent chez la femme entre 25 et 40 ans. Les causes les plus fréquentes sont les infections à streptocoques β-hémolytiques, la sarcoïdose, la yersiniose, la tuberculose et les entéropathies chroniques. Des cas d’EN associés à une infection par le SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) ont été récemment publiés. Nous en rapportons un nouveau cas. Observation Un homme de 32 ans sans antécédents était hospitalisé dans notre service de dermatologie pour prise en charge diagnostique et thérapeutique de multiples nodules sous cutanés au niveau des faces d’extension des membres évoluant depuis 2 semaines dans un contexte de fièvre et de syndrome pseudo-grippal. L’examen clinique a montré de multiples nouures de quelques centimètres de diamètre confluentes par endroit, chaudes, fermes et douloureuses à la palpation associées à un œdème déclive des chevilles cadrant typiquement avec un EN. Le patient avait une gorge érythémateuse. Il était fébrile à 39°C, tachycarde et légèrement polypnéique avec un taux de saturation en oxygène à 97 %. La vitesse de sédimentation était accélérée. Le patient a été mis initialement sous amoxicilline pendant 6jours sans amélioration. Le bilan étiologique de l’EN à savoir le dosage des ASLO, l’examen bactériologique du frottis de gorge, la radiographie de thorax, l’IDR à la tuberculine, la sérologie des hépatites B et C et le dosage de l’enzyme de conversion était négatif. Devant le contexte pandémique de COVID-19, les signes respiratoires, la fièvre et le syndrome inflammatoire biologique, un prélèvement nasopharyngé pour le test PCR COVID-19 a été pratiqué et revenu positif. Le diagnostic d’EN associé au COVID-19 a été retenu. Le patient a été mis sous traitement symptomatique avec une bonne évolution de l’EN et une régression des signes de COVID-19. Discussion Différentes manifestations cutanées possiblement associées à la COVID-19 ont été rapportées dans la littérature. Elles sont considérées comme des présentations peu fréquentes au cours de cette infection. La physiopathologie de cette association reste, à ce jour, mal élucidée. Les lésions cutanées semblent se distribuer en quatre groupes, soient des atteintes à type d’exanthème (papulo-vésiculeux, varicelle-like et rash morbilliforme), de nature vasculaire (perniose, purpura, livédo), éruption urticarienne ou papuleuse acrale et des éruptions induites par des médicaments prescrits dans le cadre de COVID-19. D’autres lésions ont été rarement rapportées tel que l’EN, comme dans notre cas. En effet, l’infection par la COVID-19 induit une dysrégulation de la réponse immunitaire avec une élévation des interleukines (IL) 1, 2, 6, 7 et 10. Le virus pourrait infecter les cellules via les récepteurs de l’enzyme de conversion de l’angiotensine retrouvés sur plusieurs organes y inclus la peau. La pathogénie de l’EN demeure mal comprise mais une réaction d’hypersensibilité retardée médiée par l’exposition à un antigène a été rapportée. Au cours de l’EN, un polymorphisme des gènes promoteurs de l’IL 1 et 6 associé à un taux élevé d’IL 6 ont été décrits, suggérant une susceptibilité plus importante de développer un EN au cours des situations de dysrégulation immunitaire et de réaction inflammatoire excessive telle que l’infection par la COVID-19. Ceci pourrait expliquer partiellement le lien de causalité entre l’EN et la COVID-19. Chez notre patient, l’infection virale récente était le seul facteur déclenchant retrouvé. Conclusion La COVID-19 est responsable essentiellement de manifestations respiratoires, toutefois, les atteintes cutanées pourraient jouer un rôle important dans le diagnostic précoce de la maladie limitant la propagation de la pandémie. Ainsi, un EN associé à une fièvre et des signes respiratoires pourrait être attribué à une infection par la COVID-19.","Khammouma, F.; Sassi, W.; Ben Slimane, M.; Asma, B.

The most remarkable characteristic of BEN is the focal topographical nature that characterizes its occurrence at the global, national, and even household level. BEN affects only certain endemic rural foci along tributaries of the Danube River in the Balkan countries of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and Serbia. The spatial distribution has remained astonishingly unchanged with time because the disease affects the same endemic clusters as 50 years ago. The natural course of the disease is characterized by universal development of end-stage renal disease and the frequent development of upper urinary tract tumors, posing a substantial disease burden to the afflicted areas. The greatest challenge in the study of BEN has been the elucidation of its cause. The unique features of the disease, in particular its endemic nature and the long incubation period required for the disease to develop, have led to the proposal that BEN represents a unique environmental disease. The quest for the responsible environmental factor has been long and diverse, and although no definitive answer has been provided to date, converging lines of evidence support the theory that long-term consumption of food contaminated with aristolochic acid underlies the pathogenesis of BEN. The present review describes the evolution of our knowledge of BEN in relation to the development of the main theories for its pathogenesis.","Bamias, Giorgos; Boletis, John",Am J Kidney Dis,55,6

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic national stay-at-home orders and postponed elective surgeries, we converted upcoming clinic visits into telemedicine visits and rescheduled other patients thought not to be markedly affected by surgical postponement. We reviewed the charts of all patients who had telehealth visits from April 1 through April 30, 2020, and collected demographic information, diagnosis, type of visit, and whether they received surgery; a satisfaction questionnaire was also administered. RESULTS: In March 2020, 94% (644 of 685) of the neurosurgery clinic visits were face-to-face, whereas in April 2020, 55% (315 of 573) of the visits were telemedicine (P<.001). In April, of the 315 telemedicine visits, 172 (55%) were phone consults and 143 (45%) video consults; 101 (32%) were new consults, 195 (62%) return visits, and 18 (6%) postoperative follow-up. New consults were more likely to be video with audio than return visits and postoperative follow-up (P<.001). Only 39 patients (12%) required surgery. Ninety-one percent of the questionnaire respondents were very likely to recommend telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Rapid implementation of telemedicine to evaluate neurosurgery patients became an effective tool for preoperative consultation, postoperative and follow-up visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and decreased risks of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to patients and health care staff. Future larger studies should investigate the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine used to triage surgical from nonsurgical patients, potential cost-savings from reducing travel burdens and lost work time, improved access, reduced wait times, and impact on patient satisfaction.","De Biase, Gaetano; Freeman, William D.; Bydon, Mohamad; Smith, Nathan; Jerreld, Daniel; Pascual, Jorge; Casler, John; Hasse, Chris; Quiñones-Hinojosa, Alfredo; Abode-Iyamah, Kingsley",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,55,24

Cyclosporine A (CsA) acts immunosuppressive by blocking T cell activation and antigen presentation. Alisporivir, a non-immunosuppressive CsA analog in clinical development, does not inhibit T cell activation. In this study we explored the impact of alisporivir on antigen presentation. METHODS: Hepatoma cells endogenously expressing the epitope-restricting major histocompatibility complex-class I (MHC-I) allele HLA-A2 and constitutively expressing a viral antigen were established to study the impact of cyclophilin-inhibitors on antigen presentation. Antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell activation and MHC-I surface expression were measured to quantify antigen presentation. RESULTS: Our work establishes a novel cell culture model to study antigen presentation in liver-derived cells. Authentic regulation of antigen presentation was ensured by the action of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Alisporivir pretreatment stimulated antigen presentation by hepatoma target cells, leading to enhancement of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell activation by 40%. Alisporivir, as well as a panel of other cyclophilin-inhibitors, induced an increase of MHC-I and beta-2 microglobulin on the surface of several cell lines. The drug neither enhanced MHC-I transcript or protein levels nor affected surface expression of other proteins or protein trafficking in general. Proteasome-inhibitors completely blocked the alisporivir-directed enhancement of surface MHC-I, suggesting an influence of the drug on peptide-availability. CONCLUSIONS: Alisporivir stimulates antigen presentation by inducing enhanced MHC-I surface expression, thereby promoting antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell activation. This immunostimulatory function might further contribute to the antiviral activity of non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin-inhibitors.","Esser-Nobis, Katharina; Schmidt, Julia; Nitschke, Katja; Neumann-Haefelin, Christoph; Thimme, Robert; Lohmann, Volker",J Hepatol,55,4

To investigate the functional role of these cysteines in TRH‐DE we used a site‐directed mutagenesis approach and replaced individually each cysteine by a serine residue. The results revealed that the proteolytically truncated and enzymatically fully active enzyme consists of two identical subunits that are associated noncovalently by protein–protein interactions but not via interchain S‐S bridges. The eight cysteines contained within this region are all important for the structure of the individual subunit and the enzymatic activity, which is dramatically reduced in all mutant enzymes. This is even true for the four cysteines that are clustered within the C‐terminal domain remote from the Zn‐binding consensus sequence HEICH. In contrast, Cys68, which resides within the stalk region seven residues from the end of the hydrophobic membrane‐spanning domain, can be replaced by serine without a significant change in the enzymatic activity. Interestingly, this residue is involved in the formation of an interchain disulfide bridge. Covalent dimerization of the subunits, however, does not seem to be essential for efficient biosynthesis, enzymatic activity and trafficking to the cell surface.","Papadopoulos, Theofilos; Heuer, Heike; Bauer, Karl",Eur J Biochem,55,8

The aim of this study was to assess if subclinical myocardial dysfunction could be identified using left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a search of COVID-19 patients admitted to our institution from January 1st, 2020 to June 8th, 2020, which revealed 589 patients (mean age = 66 ± 18, male = 56%). All available 60 transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) were reviewed and off-line assessment of LV-GLS was performed in 40 studies that had sufficient quality images and the views required to calculate LV-GLS. We also analyzed electrocardiograms and laboratory findings including inflammatory markers, Troponin-I, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). RESULTS: Of 589 patients admitted with COVID-19 during our study period, 60 (10.1%) underwent TTE during hospitalization. Findings consistent with overt myocardial involvement included reduced ejection fraction (23%), wall motion abnormalities (22%), low stroke volume (82%) and increased LV wall thickness (45%). LV-GLS analysis was available for 40 patients and was abnormal in 32 patients (80%). All patients with LV dysfunction had elevated cardiac enzymes and positive inflammatory biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical myocardial dysfunction as measured via reduced LV-GLS is frequent, occurring in 80% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, while prevalent LV function parameters such as reduced EF and wall motion abnormalities were less frequent findings. The mechanism of cardiac injury in COVID-19 infection is the subject of ongoing research.","Shmueli, Hezzy; Shah, Maulin; Ebinger, Joseph E.; Nguyen, Long-Co; Chernomordik, Fernando; Flint, Nir; Botting, Patrick; Siegel, Robert J.",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,55,23

To reduce the psychological burden of amateur marathon runners and improve the participation experience, the current study used the health belief model to study the relationship among health beliefs, attitude to preventative behavior, self-efficacy, and health values of amateur marathon runners. METHODS: A total of 342 data were collected, and using the PROCESS (analytical procedures developed for mediating and moderating effects tests based on SPSS and SAS). A series of multiple linear regression models were established to study the relationship between variables, and the bootstrap confidence interval was selected to test the mediating and moderating effect. RESULTS: The results showed that perceived health threat (b = 0.463, p <0.05), health behavior expectations (b = 0.373, p <0.001), self-efficacy (b = 0.322, p <0.001), and behavioral attitudes (b = 0.230, p <0.001) can be regarded as antecedent variables for predicting preventative behaviors. In addition, the results also show that health behavior expectations, self-efficacy, and behavioral attitudes play chain-mediating role between perceived health threat and preventative behaviors. Health values appear to play a moderating role in the direct/indirect effects of perceived health threat on preventive behavior through a number of mediating variables. DISCUSSION: This study emphasizes that the amateur marathon runners must improve their health concept and take effective preventive measures before participating in the competition. According to this research, it is the responsibility of the event parties, public health officials and relevant departments of the host city to provide rich health information and risk education to amateur marathon runners. More public service advertisements or educational materials are needed to be placed on runners to enhance their awareness of the necessity and importance of taking preventive measures.","Zuo, Yifan; Zhang, Mu; Si, Yuqi; Wu, Xiaoyuan; Ren, Zhanbing",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,55,1

Several factors are sharpening the tension between the supply and demand for high quality health information, and the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) provide a high-profile example. With thousands of indicators recommended but few measured well, the worldwide health community needs to focus its efforts on improving measurement of a small set of priority areas. Priority indicators should be selected on the basis of public-health significance and several dimensions of measurability. Health statistics can be divided into three types: crude, corrected, and predicted. Health statistics are necessary inputs to planning and strategic decision making, programme implementation, monitoring progress towards targets, and assessment of what works and what does not. Crude statistics that are biased have no role in any of these steps; corrected statistics are preferred. For strategic decision making, when corrected statistics are unavailable, predicted statistics can play an important part. For monitoring progress towards agreed targets and assessment of what works and what does not, however, predicted statistics should not be used. Perhaps the most effective method to decrease controversy over health statistics and to encourage better primary data collection and the development of better analytical methods is a strong commitment to provision of an explicit data audit trail. This initiative would make available the primary data, all post-data collection adjustments, models including covariates used for farcasting and forecasting, and necessary documentation to the public.","Murray, Christopher JL",Lancet,55,1

To keep the pandemic at bay, countries have implemented various measures to interrupt the transmission of the virus from person to person and prevent an overload of their health systems. We analyze the impact of these measures implemented against the COVID-19 pandemic by using a sample of 68 countries, Puerto Rico and the 50 federal states of the United States of America, four federal states of Australia, and eight federal states of Canada, involving 6,941 daily observations. We show that measures are essential for containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. After controlling for daily COVID-19 tests, we find evidence to suggest that school closures, shut-downs of non-essential business, mass gathering bans, travel restrictions in and out of risk areas, national border closures and/or complete entry bans, and nationwide curfews decrease the growth rate of the coronavirus and thus the peak of daily confirmed cases. We also find evidence to suggest that combinations of these measures decrease the daily growth rate at a level outweighing that of individual measures. Consequently, and despite extensive vaccinations, we contend that the implemented measures help contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and ease the overstressed capacity of the healthcare systems.","Kaimann, Daniel; Tanneberg, Ilka",PLoS One,55,1

Liver dysfunction has been reported to occur frequently in patients with COVID-19, although its significance has not yet been elucidated. METHODS: The subjects were 35 patients with COVID-19, and clinical characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. COVID-19 patients requiring ventilator were classified as having severe COVID-19. RESULTS: All 35 patients were diagnosed as having mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at admission, but the severity aggravated to severe in 8 patients (22.9%) in hospital. Hepatocellular-type liver injury, defined as elevation of the serum AST and/or ALT levels to ≥ 3 times the ULN, was seen in 2 patients (5.7%), and cholestasis-type liver injury, defined as elevation of the serum ALP, γ-GTP and/or total bilirubin levels to ≥ twice the ULN, was seen in 4 patients (11.4%). A total of 9 patients (25.7%) fulfilled the criteria for liver injury. The percentage of patients with liver injury was higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in the remaining patients (P = 0.001). Both the hepatic CT attenuation values and the liver-to-spleen attenuation (L/S) ratios at admission were lower in the former patients than in the latter patients (P < 0.001). ROC curve revealed the optimal cut-off value of the L/S ratio of 1.03 for discriminating between patients with severe and non-severe diseases. The hepatic CT attenuation values increased at the remission phase of the disease as compared to the values at admission (P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Liver dysfunction associated with reduced hepatic CT attenuation values correlated with the disease severity in patients with COVID-19.","Uchida, Yoshihito; Uemura, Hayato; Yamaba, Shinpei; Hamada, Daisuke; Tarumoto, Norihito; Maesaki, Shigefumi; Mochida, Satoshi",J Gastroenterol,55,1

Probability of contracting this highly contagious infection is similar across age groups but disease severity and fatality among aged patients with or without comorbidities are higher. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection may augment aging-related gene expression alterations resulting in severe outcomes in elderly patients. Methodology We performed a comparative analysis of publicly available transcriptome data from Broncho Alveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF)/lung/blood of healthy aging group with i) COVID-19 patients; and ii) data of host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Results We observed i) a significant overlap of gene expression profiles of patients’ BALF and blood with lung and blood of the healthy group respectively; ii) a more pronounced overlap in blood compared to lung; and iii) a similar overlap between host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 and aging blood transcriptome. Conclusions Pathway enrichment analysis of overlapping gene sets suggests that infection alters expression of genes already dysregulated in the elderly, which together may lead to poor prognosis. eQTLs in these genes may also confer poor outcome in young patients worsening with age and co-morbidities. Furthermore, the pronounced overlap observed in blood may explain clinical symptoms including blood clots, strokes, heart attack, multi-organ failure etc. in severe cases. This model based on a limited patient dataset seems robust and holds promise for testing larger tissue specific datasets from patients with varied severity and across populations.","Bhattacharyya, Upasana; Thelma, B K",bioRxiv,55,22

OBJECTIVE: : This study sought to understand how people living with MS in the United States experienced distress and perceived their COVID-19-related risk during the first surge of the pandemic. METHODS: : This was a web-based, self-report survey of people with MS who were living in the United States during the early stage of COVID-19. Primary outcomes were depression, anxiety, and positive-affect and well-being. Participants (N = 491) also provided data on demographics, MS-related factors, COVID-19 factors, and psychological coping. RESULTS: : Psychological distress was associated with age, psychological coping strategies, and having had symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but not with MS disease-related variables and COVID-19 risk factors. Perception of COVID-19-related risk was associated with age, MS disease severity, COVID-19-related factors, and anxiety. CONCLUSION: : This study demonstrated that even during COVID-19, distress and risk perception are primarily driven by psychological factors, experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and age, with minimal contribution from individual differences in health status, providing an impetus for continued efforts to optimize psychological interventions for people living with MS.","Alschuler, Kevin N.; Roberts, Michelle K.; Herring, Tracy E.; Ehde, Dawn M.",Mult Scler Relat Disord,55,16

However, expeditiously designed trials without careful consideration of dose rationale have often resulted in treatment failure and toxicity in the target patient population, which includes not only adults but also children. Here we show how paediatric regimens can be identified using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) principles to establish the target exposure and evaluate the implications of dose selection for early and late intervention. Using in vitro data describing the antiviral activity and published pharmacokinetic data for the agents of interest, we apply a model-based approach to assess the exposure range required for adequate viral clearance and eradication. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were subsequently used with clinical trial simulations to characterise the probability target attainment (PTA) associated with enhanced antiviral activity in the lungs. Our analysis shows that neither remdesivir, nor anti-malarial drugs can achieve the desirable target exposure range based on a mg/kg dosing regimen, due to a limited safety margin and high concentrations needed to ensure the required PTA. To date, there has been limited focus on suitable interventions for children affected by COVID-19. Most clinical trials have defined doses selection criteria empirically, without thorough evaluation of the PTA. The current results illustrate how model-based approaches can be used for the integration of clinical and nonclinical data, providing a robust framework for assessing the probability of pharmacological success and consequently the dose rationale for antiviral drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.","Romano, Federico; D’Agate, Salvatore; Della Pasqua, Oscar",Pharmaceutics,55,10

In December 2020, two mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines were approved for use in the United States, which provide immunity to those receiving the vaccine. Maternally derived antibodies are a key element of infants' immunity. Certain vaccines given to pregnant and lactating mothers provide immunity to infants through transmission across the placenta, umbilical cord (IgG), and human milk (IgA). Human milk produced by mothers with a history of COVID-19 infection contains SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG. The purpose of this study is to determine whether SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins are found in human milk after the COVID-19 vaccination, and to characterize the types of immunoglobulins present. Methods: This is a prospective observational study conducted at Shands Hospital, University of Florida, from December 2020 to March 2021. Twenty-two lactating health care workers who received the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna) made up the sample group. Plasma and human milk were collected at three time points (prevaccination, post-first vaccine dose, and post-second vaccine dose). SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG in human milk and in plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Maternal demographics were compiled. Results: We found significant secretion of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG in human milk and plasma after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Conclusions: Our results show that the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines induce SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG secretion in human milk. Further studies are needed to determine the duration of this immune response, its capacity to neutralize the COVID-19 virus, the transfer of passive immunity to breastfeeding infants, and the potential therapeutic use of human milk IgA to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19.","Valcarce, Vivian; Stafford, Lauren Stewart; Neu, Josef; Cacho, Nicole; Parker, Leslie; Mueller, Martina; Burchfield, David J; Li, Nan; Larkin, Joseph",Breastfeed. med,55,8

Nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV is one of the key indicators for clinical diagnosis. However, the positive rate is only 30-50%. Currently, fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR technology is mainly used to detect 2019-nCoV. According to “The Laboratory Technical Guidelines for Detection 2019-nCoV (Fourth Edition)” issued by National Health and Commission of China and “The Experts’ Consensus on Nucleic Acid Detection of 2019-nCoV” released by Chinese Society of Laboratory Medicine, the human samples must be placed under 56°C or higher to inactivate the viruses in order to keep the inspectors from virus infection before the nucleic acids were isolated as the template of qRT-PCR. In this study, we demonstrated that the virus inactivation treatment disrupts its genome integrity seriously when using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (vaccine), a kind of coronavirus, as a model. Our results showed that only 50.11% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation of 56 °C for 30 minutes and only 3.36% left after the inactivation of 92 °C for 5 minutes when the samples were preserved by Hank’s solution, one of an isotonic salt solutions currently suggested. However, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 °C or higher if the samples were preserved with an optimized solution to protect the RNA from being disrupted. We therefore highly recommend to carry out systematic investigation on the impact of high temperature inactivation on the integrity of 2019-nCoV genome and develop a sample preservation solution to protect the detectable templates of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids from high temperature inactivation damage.","Zhang, Qingxin; Zhao, Qingshun",bioRxiv,55,1

Alongside established next-generation sequencing protocols, the MinION sequencing device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) has become a serious competitor for routine whole-genome sequencing. Here, we established a novel, rapid and high-throughput MinION multiplexing workflow based on a universal RT-PCR. METHODS: Twelve representative influenza A virus samples of multiple subtypes were universally amplified in a one-step RT-PCR and subsequently sequenced on the MinION instrument in conjunction with a barcoding library preparation kit from the rapid family and the MinIT performing live base-calling. The identical PCR products were sequenced on an IonTorrent platform and, after final consensus assembly, all data was compared for validation. To prove the practicability of the MinION-MinIT method in human and veterinary diagnostics, we sequenced recent and historical influenza strains for further benchmarking. RESULTS: The MinION-MinIT combination generated over two million reads for twelve samples in a six-hour sequencing run, from which a total of 72% classified as quality screened, trimmed and mapped influenza reads to produce full genome sequences.

Tight-fitting N95 FFRs are respiratory protective devices (RPDs) designed to efficiently filter aerosols. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers (HCWs) throughout the world continue to face shortages of disposable N95 FFRs. Existing version of widely available FDA cleared loose-fitting surgical masks with straps do not provide reliable protection against aerosols. We tested the faceseal of a modified strapless form-fitting sealed version of surgical mask using quantitative fit testing (QNFT) and compared the performance of this mask with that of N95 FFRs and unmodified loose-fitting surgical masks. METHODS: Twenty HCWs participated in the study (10 women; 10 men; age 23–59 years). To create the sealed surgical masks, we removed the straps from loose-fitting surgical masks, made new folds, and used adhesive medical tape to secure the new design. All participants underwent QNFT with a loose-fitting surgical mask, the sealed surgical mask, and an N95 FFR; fit factors were recorded. Each QNFT was performed using a protocol of four exercises: (i) bending over, (ii) talking, (iii) moving head side to side, and (iv) moving head up and down. When the overall fit factor for the sealed surgical mask or N95 FFR was <100, the participant retook the test. Participants scored the breathability and comfort of the sealed surgical mask and N95 FFR on a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (unfavorable) to 10 (favorable). RESULTS: The median fit factor for the sealed surgical mask (53.8) was significantly higher than that of the loose-fitting surgical mask (3.0) but lower than that of the N95 FFR (177.0) (P < 0.001), equating to significantly lower inward leakage of ambient aerosols (measuring 0.04–0.06 µm) with the sealed surgical mask (geometric mean 1.79%; geometric standard deviation 1.45%; range 0.97–4.03%) than with the loose-fitting surgical mask (29.5%; 2.01%; 25–100.0%) but still higher than with the N95 FFR (0.66%; 1.46%; 0.50–1.97%) (P < 0.001). Sealed surgical masks led to a marked reduction (range 60–98%) in inward leakage of aerosols in all the participants, compared to loose-fitting surgical masks. Among the exercises, talking had a greater effect on reducing overall fit factor for the sealed surgical mask than for the N95 FFR; when talking was excluded, the fit factor for the sealed surgical mask improved significantly (median 53.8 to 81.5; P < 0.001). The sealed surgical mask, when compared with the N95 FFR, offered better reported breathability (median VAS 9 versus 5; P < 0.001) and comfort (9 versus 5; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Widely available loose-fitting surgical masks can be easily modified to achieve faceseal with adhesives. Unlike loose-fitting surgical masks, sealed surgical masks can markedly reduce inward leakage of aerosols and may therefore offer useful levels of respiratory protection during an extreme shortage of N95 FFRs and could benefit HCWs who cannot comply with N95 FFRs due to intolerance. However, because a wide range of surgical masks is commercially available, individual evaluation of such masks is highly recommended before sealed versions are used as RPDs.","Karuppasamy, Karunakaravel; Obuchowski, Nancy",Ann Work Expo Health,55,16

This antimalarial drug is also chronically used to treat patients with autoimmune diseases. METHODS: By analysing the Portuguese anonymized data on private and public based medical prescriptions we have identified all cases chronically receiving HCQ for the management of diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases. Additionally, we have detected all laboratory confirmed cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and all laboratory confirmed negative cases in the Portuguese population (mandatorily registered in a centrally managed database). Cross linking the two sets of data has allowed us to compare the proportion of HCQ chronic treatment (at least 2 grams per month) in laboratory confirmed cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with laboratory confirmed negative cases. RESULTS: Out of 26,815 SARS‐CoV‐2 positive patients, 77 (0.29%) were chronically treated with HCQ, while 1,215 (0.36%) out of 333,489 negative patients were receiving it chronically (P=0.04). After adjustment for age, sex, and chronic treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants, the odds ratio of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection for chronic treatment with HCQ has been 0.51 (0.37‐0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that chronic treatment with HCQ confer protection against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. This article is protected by copyright.

The newly discovered coronavirus, entitled SARS-CoV-2, is the seventh member of the human coronaviruses. The main pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is severe pneumonia, RNAaemia, accompanied by glass turbidity, and acute cardiac injury. It possesses a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome which is 60–140 nm in diameter, and has a size of 26–32 kbp. Viral pathogenesis is accomplished with spike glycoprotein through the employment of a membrane-bound aminopeptidase, called the ACE2, as its primary cell receptor. It has been confirmed that various factors such as different national rules for quarantine and various races or genetic backgrounds might influence the mortality and infection rate of COVID-19 in the geographic areas. In addition to various known and unknown factors and host genetic susceptibility, mutations and genetic variabilities of the virus itself have a critical impact on variable clinical features of COVID-19. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome is more stable than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, it has a relatively high dynamic mutation rate with respect to other RNA viruses. It's noteworthy that, some mutations can be founder mutations and show specific geographic patterns. Undoubtedly, these mutations can drive viral genetic variability, and because of genotype-phenotype correlation, resulting in a virus with more/lower/no decrease in natural pathogenic fitness or on the other scenario, facilitating their rapid antigenic shifting to escape the host immunity and also inventing a drug resistance virus, so converting it to a more infectious or deadly virus. Overall, the detection of all mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and their relations with pathological changes is nearly impossible, mostly due to asymptomatic subjects. In this review paper, the reported mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 and related variations in virus structure and pathogenicity in different geographic areas and genotypes are widely investigated. Many studies need to be repeated in other regions/locations for other people to confirm the findings. Such studies could benefit patient-specific therapy, according to genotyping patterns of SARS-CoV-2 distribution.","Bakhshandeh, Behnaz; Jahanafrooz, Zohreh; Abbasi, Ardeshir; Goli, Matin Babaee; Sadeghi, Mahya; Mottaqi, Mohammad Sadeq; Zamani, Maryam",Microb Pathog,55,24

One negative consequence of the ongoing pandemic is anxiety brought about by uncertainty and the COVID-19 disease. Increased anxiety is a potential risk factor for wellbeing at work. This study investigated psychological, situational, and socio-demographic predictors of COVID-19 anxiety using longitudinal data. Methods: A nationally representative sample of Finnish workers (N = 1308) was collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis. Eighty percent of the participants responded to the follow-up study (N = 1044). COVID-19 anxiety was measured with a modified Spielberger State–Trait Anxiety Inventory. Psychological and situational predictors included perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, personality, social support received from the work community, and remote working. A number of socio-demographic factors were also investigated. Results: Perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, and neuroticism were identified as robust psychological predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. Increase in psychological distress and technostress during the COVID-19 crisis predicted higher COVID-19 anxiety. A recent change in their field of work and decreased social support from work communities predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Women and young people experienced higher anxiety. Conclusions: Different factors explain workers’ COVID-19 anxiety. Increased anxiety can disrupt wellbeing at work, emphasizing the organizations’ role in maintaining an inclusive and caring work culture and providing technical and psychological support to workers during crisis.","Savolainen, Iina; Oksa, Reetta; Savela, Nina; Celuch, Magdalena; Oksanen, Atte",Int J Environ Res Public Health,55,16

Methods A multivariate model for the log10 of viral reproductive rate was constructed for each country using lockdown stringency (Oxford University tracker), temperature and humidity, for the 1st 110 days of 2020. This was validated by extrapolating to the following 51 days, and comparing the predicted viral rate and cumulative mortality with WHO data. The country models was extrapolated to July 2021 using projected weather forecast for four scenarios; continuing with the 11/6/2020 lockdown policy, 100% lockdown, 20% lockdown and no lockdown. Results From pooled data (40 countries), lockdown stringency had a strong negative correlation with log10viral reproductive rate (-0.648 at 21 days later). Maximum temperature correlated at -0.14, 14 days later and humidity correlated at +0.25, 22 days later. Predictive Models were generated for 11 countries using multivariate regression of these parameters. The R2 correlation for log10R0 ranged from 0.817 to 0.987 for the model generation period. For the validation period, the Pearson's coefficient of correlation for log10R0 ranged from 0.344 to 0.984 and for cumulative mortality from 0.980 to 1.000. Forward extrapolation of these models for 5 nations, demonstrate, that removing the lockdown will result in rapid spread of the disease ranging from as soon as July 2020 for Russia, UK, Italy and India to January 2021 for the USA. The current (11/6/20) lockdown in the USA, Spain, UK, France, Germany, Turkey can control the disease but other nations will need to intensify their lockdowns to prevent future resurgence. Most nations will require more stringent lockdowns in January than in July. Conclusion The viral reproductive rate is highly predicted by a combination of lockdown stringency, temperature and humidity. Country specific predictive models can provide useful forecast of policy requirements.","Ellis, David SJ; Papadopoulos, Dimitris I; Donkov, Ivo; Bishara, Samuel",,55,20

Measuring hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs), which reflect the integrated long-term cortisol levels, may elucidate the impact of COVID-19 related stress on healthcare professionals. In the current study, we investigated experienced stress in 693 healthcare workers, with hair samples for cortisol analysis collected from a subset of 67 female nurses. The HCCs in two 3 cm hair segments corresponding to periods before and during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 were compared. To evaluate the effect of working in the first line, the sample was divided into two groups based on the COVID-19 risk estimated by the nurses. Covariates in the model included perceived stress (PSS), perceived social support (MSPSS), and quality of sleep (PSQI) measured via an online questionnaire. The data showed that more than 75% of healthcare workers agreed that COVID-19 led to increased stress at their workplace. The hair cortisol analysis showed higher HCCs in the hair segments corresponding to the time of the pandemic compared to hair corresponding to an earlier period (partial η(2)(90%CI) = 0.123–0.397); in the same model, higher HCCs were also found in nurses from high-risk environments compared to low-risk ones (partial η(2)(90%CI) = 0.002–0.176). None of the subjective questionnaire measures were significant predictors of HCCs. In conclusion, these data showed that HCCs reflect the increased stress among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the difference in nurses between high- and low-risk environments.","Rajcani, Jakub; Vytykacova, Simona; Solarikova, Petra; Brezina, Igor",Psychoneuroendocrinology,55,17

Recent studies questioned their clinical utility in stroke settings for relying on verbal abilities and education level, as well as lack of consideration for aphasia and neglect. We aimed to review the clinical utility of the MMSE and MoCA for stroke patients in Asia and provide recommendations for clinical practice. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct were searched for relevant articles. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias. RevMan 5.4 was used for data synthesis (sensitivity and specificity) and covariates were identified. Results: Among the 48 full-text articles reviewed, 11 studies were included with 3735 total subjects; of these studies, 7 (77%) were conducted in China, 3 (27%) in Singapore, and 1 (9%) in South Korea. Both the MMSE and MoCA generally showed adequate sensitivity and specificity. Education was identified as a covariate that significantly affected detection accuracy. Due to heterogeneity in cutoff scores, methodologies, and languages, it was not feasible to suggest a single cutoff score. One additional point is recommended for MoCA for patients with <6 years of education. Conclusion: Clinicians in Asia are strongly recommended to consider the education level of stroke patients when interpreting the results of the MMSE and MoCA. Further studies in other Asian countries are needed to understand their clinical value in stroke settings.","Khaw, Julia; Subramaniam, Ponnusamy; Abd Aziz, Noor Azah; Ali Raymond, Azman; Wan Zaidi, Wan Asyraf; Ghazali, Shazli Ezzat",Int J Environ Res Public Health,55,1

ACE2 has now also been identified as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and it has been proposed that inhibiting this interaction might be used in treating patients with COVID-19. However, it is not known whether human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks growth of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that clinical grade hrsACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery from Vero cells by a factor of 1,000–5,000. An equivalent mouse rsACE2 had no effect. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids, which can be inhibited by hrsACE2.

The presence of ACE2 receptors in the liver renders this organ a potential target for the novel coronavirus. METHODS: We performed 14 complete autopsies of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In each case we stained liver tissue sections with haematoxylin/eosin, Masson blue trichrome stain, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Perls, and performed cytokeratin-7 (CK7) immunochemistry. RESULTS: Macroscopically, livers were pale and yellowish in 8 of 14 (57%) patients, and had a nutmeg appearance in the other 6 cases (42%). Histologically, centrolobular necrosis was observed in 12 cases (86%), and was associated with discreet to moderate lobular or portal inflammation. Steatosis was seen in 8 cases (57%), but fibrosis was rare. Cholestasis and discrete bile duct proliferation was observed in 5 cases (36%). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The main histological changes can be explained by the hypoxic status as a result of severe hypoxemic pneumonia leading to death. Drug toxicity may also play a role in certain cases. Other histological changes may be explained by previous hepatic conditions or underlying hepatic diseases. We concluded that COVID-19 infection was not associated with a specific histopathological pattern of the liver.","Schmit, Grégory; Lelotte, Julie; Vanhaebost, Jessica; Horsmans, Yves; Van Bockstal, Mieke; Baldin, Pamela",Pathobiology,55,1

However, delays in symptom onset, testing, and reporting obscure the dynamics of transmission, necessitating methods to remove the effects of stochastic delays from observed data. Existing estimators can be sensitive to model misspecification and censored observations; many analysts have instead used methods that exhibit strong bias or do not account for delays. We develop an estimator with a regularization scheme to cope with these sources of noise, which we term the Robust Incidence Deconvolution Estimator (RIDE). We validate RIDE on synthetic data, comparing accuracy and stability to existing approaches. We then use RIDE to study COVID-19 records in the United States, and find evidence that infection estimates from reported cases can be more informative than estimates from mortality data. To implement these methods, we release incidental, a ready-to-use R implementation of our estimator that can aid ongoing efforts to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic.","Miller, A.

RESULTS: Significant differences were observed regarding both the age of the patients at the time of the primary surgeries, and surgical times between the two groups. Nonstatistical significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding the presurgical conditions, postoperative outcomes, and complications. Rate of COVID-19 infection was 1.25%. CONCLUSIONS: The surgical protocol used for cleft lip and palate repair during the COVID-19 pandemic is a safe method based on the observed postoperative outcomes.

The exposure was PM(2.5), and the confounders were weather (temperature and humidity) and other pollutants (PM(10), SO(2), CO, O(3), and NO(2)). The outcomes were emergency department (ED) visits with psychiatric disease codes (F00-F99 in ICD10 codes). General additive models were used for the statistical analysis to calculate the adjusted relative risks (ARRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the daily number of ED visits with a lag of 1 to 3 days following a 10 μg/m(3) increase in PM(2.5). RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 67,561 ED visits for psychiatric diseases were identified and tested for association with PM(2.5).

During that time we investigated the clinical features, treatment, and nursing care of 36 patients and reported on 12 of these patients' perceptions of their illness experience. PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical features, treatment, nursing care and perceptions of the illness experience of patients with SARS in Hong Kong in order to better inform nurses caring for patients with this highly contagious and potentially lethal disease. METHOD: We abstracted data from the medical and nursing records on the clinical features, treatment and nursing care of 36 patients (21 women, 15 men) in whom SARS was diagnosed and who were admitted to the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong between March 15 and April 15, 2003. A review of the hospital's policy and procedures on infection control was also undertaken. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of the patients to elicit their perceptions of the illness experience. FINDINGS: The most common symptoms were cough (83%), dyspnea (80.6%), malaise (69.4%) and fever (61%). Less common symptoms included headache (38.9%), diarrhea (38.9%), dizziness (30.6%), myalgia (25%), chills (19.4%), nausea and vomiting (19.4%) and rigor (the occurrence of a sensation of hot-and-cold and shivering in addition to teeth chattering and bed shaking) (8.3%). All 36 patients received a combination of corticosteroids and ribavirin. The patients were at risk of drug-related adverse reactions and deterioration of respiratory function, and nursing vigilance was required. CONCLUSION: Nursing patients with SARS was challenging as the disease was highly contagious and potentially lethal, and not much was known about this disease. In addition to the use of frontline treatment, infection control and sensitivity to individual responses to sudden and catastrophic illness were required to support these patients. From this outbreak of SARS, we have learned the importance of infection control in containing and controlling the disease. Other lessons included the need to strengthen the surge capacity in our hospitals and support health care workers during the crisis.","Tiwari, Agnes; Chan, Sophia; Wong, Alan; Tai, Josepha; Cheng, Karen; Chan, Judy; Tsang, Kenneth",Nurs Outlook,55,29

Variants such as temperature and relative humidity in the dental cabinet were considered. METHODS: Using a particle counter, a pilot study was conducted, in which 98 consecutive recordings were made during appointments of patients undergoing orthodontic treatments. Temperature, relative humidity and particles present at the beginning (AR) and during the appointment (BR) were recorded. A control record (CR) of temperature, relative humidity and particles present was made before the start of the clinical activity. In addition to conventional statistics, differential descriptive procedures were used to analyse results, and the influence of relative humidity on particle concentration was analysed by statistical modelling with regression equations. RESULTS: The number of particles present, regardless of their size, was much higher in AR than in CR (p < .001). The same was true for relative humidity and ambient temperature. The relationship between relative humidity and particle number was determined to be exponential. LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY: The limitations are associated with sample size, environmental conditions of the room and lack of discrimination among the procedures performed. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that from the moment a patient enters a dental office, a large number of additional particles are generated. During treatment, the number of particles of 0.3 microns—which have a high capacity to penetrate the respiratory tract-increases.

Etoposide, for instance, is the frontline chemotherapeutic drug used against various cancers due to its superior anticancer activity. It has recently been redeveloped for the purpose of treating cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. Podophyllotoxin and its naturally occurring congeners have low bioavailability and almost all these initially discovered compounds cause systemic toxicity and development of drug resistance. Moreover, the production of synthetic derivatives that could suffice for the clinical limitations of these naturally occurring compounds is not economically feasible. These challenges demanded continuous devotions towards improving the druggability of these drugs and continue to seek structure-optimization strategies. The discovery of renewable sources including microbial origin for podophyllotoxin is another possible approach.

We consider repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing models for the purpose of containing outbreaks in the residential campus community. The goal of repeat testing is to detect and isolate new infections rapidly to block transmission that would otherwise occur both on and off campus. The models allow for specification of aspects including scheduled on-campus resident screening at a given frequency, test sensitivity that can depend on the time since infection, imported infections from off campus throughout the school term, and a lag from testing until student isolation due to laboratory turnaround and student relocation delay. For early- (late-) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by age of infection, we find that weekly screening cannot reliably contain outbreaks with reproductive numbers above 1.4 (1.6) if more than one imported exposure per 10,000 students occurs daily. Screening every three days can contain outbreaks providing the reproductive number remains below 1.75 (2.3) if transmission happens earlier (later) with time from infection, but at the cost of increased false positive rates requiring more isolation quarters for students testing positive. Testing frequently while minimizing the delay from testing until isolation for those found positive are the most controllable levers for preventing large residential college outbreaks.

Herein, we explored the molecular mechanism by which microRNA‐205‐5p (miR‐205‐5p) affects the autophagy of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and pulmonary fibrosis in mice with silicosis through the E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1)/S‐phase kinase‐associated protein 2 (SKP2)/Beclin1 axis. Alveolar macrophages (MH‐S cells) were exposed to crystalline silica (CS) to develop an in vitro model, and mice were treated with CS to establish an in vivo model. Decreased Beclin1 and increased SKP2 and E2F1 were identified in mice with silicosis. We silenced or overexpressed miR‐205‐5p, E2F1, SKP2 and Beclin1 to investigate their potential roles in pulmonary fibrosis in vivo and autophagy in vitro. Recombinant adenovirus mRFP‐GFP‐LC3 was transduced into the MH‐S cells to assay autophagic flow. Knocking down Beclin1 promoted pulmonary fibrosis and suppressed the autophagy. Co‐immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays suggested that SKP2 induced K48‐linked ubiquitination of Beclin1. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation‐PCR revealed the site where E2F1 bound to the SKP2 promoter between 1638 bp and 1645 bp. As shown by dual‐luciferase reporter gene assay, the transfection with miR‐205‐5p mimic inhibited the luciferase activity of the wild‐type E2F1 3′untranslated region, suggesting that miR‐205‐5p targeted E2F1. Additionally, miR‐205‐5p overexpression increased autophagy and reduced the pulmonary fibrosis, while overexpression of E2F1 or SKP2 or inhibition of Beclin1 could annul this effect. The current study elucidated that miR‐205‐5p targeted E2F1, thereby inhibiting SKP2‐mediated Beclin1 ubiquitination to promote macrophage autophagy and inhibit pulmonary fibrosis in mice with silicosis.","Qian, Qingzeng; Ma, Qinghua; Wang, Bin; Qian, Qingqiang; Zhao, Changsong; Feng, Fumin; Dong, Xiaona",J Cell Mol Med,55,1

The most popular application of this type of interaction is drug development which requires a high throughput screening of a ligand that binds to the target protein. Our goal was to find a binding ligand with a simple detection, and once this type of ligand was found, other methods could then be used to measure the detailed kinetic or thermodynamic parameters. We started with the idea that the ligand NMR signal would disappear if it was bound to the non-tumbling mass. In order to create the non-tumbling mass, we tried the aggregates of a target protein, which was fused to the elastin-like polypeptide. We chose the maltose binding proteinas a test case, and we tried it with several sugars, which included maltose, glucose, sucrose, lactose, galactose, maltotriose, and β-cyclodextrin. The maltose signal in the H-1 NMR spectrum disappeared completely as hoped around the protein to ligand ratio of 1:3 at 298 K where the proteins aggregated. The protein signals also disappeared upon aggregation except for the fast-moving part, which resulted in a cleaner background than the monomeric form. Since we only needed to look for a disappearing signal amongst those from the mixture, it should be useful in high throughput screening. Other types of sugars except for the maltotriose and β-cyclodextrin, which are siblings of the maltose, did not seem to bind at all. We believe that our system would be especially more effective when dealing with a smaller target protein, so both the protein and the bound ligand would lose their signals only when the aggregates formed. We hope that our proposed method would contribute to accelerating the development of the potent drug candidates by simultaneously identifying several binders directly from a mixture.

AIMS: To assess the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on the sleep quality of healthcare workers in a children’s healthcare centre in Wuhan. METHODS: A cross-sectional, anonymized, self-reported questionnaire survey was conducted at the Children’s Healthcare Centre of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. The questionnaire consisted of three parts, including socio-demographic characteristics and COVID-19 epidemic-related factors, the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and Zung’s self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS). RESULTS: In total, 47 out of 123 (38%) participants with PSQI scores > 7 were identified as having sleep disturbance. A logistic regression analysis showed that sleep disturbance was independently associated with being an only child (adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.40 (1.21–9.57), P < 0.05), exposure to COVID-19 patients (adjusted OR and 95% CI 2.97 (1.08–8.18), P < 0.05) and depression (adjusted OR and 95% CI 2.83 (1.10–7.27), P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that, during the outbreak of COVID-19, sleep disturbance was highly prevalent among paediatric healthcare workers, and sleep disturbance was independently associated with being an only child, exposure to COVID-19 patients and depression. Therefore, more mental health services are required for front-line paediatric healthcare workers in Wuhan.","Wang, S; Xie, L; Xu, Y; Yu, S; Yao, B; Xiang, D",Occup Med (Lond),55,1

Our model predicts that effective containment of pandemic progression in densely populated cities would be more effectively achieved by vaccination campaigns that consider the fast distribution and application of vaccines (i.e., 50% coverage in 6 months) while social distancing measures are still in place. Our results suggest that the rate of vaccination is more important than the overall vaccination coverage for containing COVID-19. In addition, our modeling indicates that widespread testing and quarantining of infected subjects would greatly benefit the success of vaccination campaigns. We envision this simple model as a friendly, readily accessible, and cost-effective tool for assisting health officials and local governments in the rational design/planning of vaccination strategies.","Alvarez, Mario Moisés; Bravo-González, Sergio; Trujillo-de Santiago, Grissel",PLoS One,55,17

The lack of effective targeted drugs and vaccines forces scientific world to search for new effective antiviral therapeutic drugs. It has reported that flavonoids have potential inhibitory activity on SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and anti-inflammatory properties. Dihydromyricetin, as a flavonol, also has antiviral and anti-inflammatory potential. However, the inhibition of dihydromyricetin on SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and the protective effect of dihydromyricetin on pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis have not been proved and explained. PURPOSE: The coronavirus main protease (M(pro)) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and to be recognized as an attractive drug target, we expect to find the inhibitor of M(pro). Novel coronavirus infection can cause severe inflammation and even sequelae of pulmonary fibrosis in critically ill patients. We hope to find a drug that can not only inhibit virus replication but also alleviate inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis in patients. METHODS: FRET-based enzymatic assay was used to evaluate the inhibit activity of dihydromyricetin on SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). Molecular docking was used to identify the binding pose of dihydromyricetin with SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). The protective effects of dihydromyricetin against BLM-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis were investigated in C57BL6 mice. BALF and lung tissue were collected for inflammation cells count, ELISA, masson and HE staining, western blotting and immunohistochemistry to analyze the effects of dihydromyricetin on pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. MTT, western blotting, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and wound healing were used to analyze the effects of dihydromyricetin on lung fibrosis mechanisms in Mlg cells. RESULTS: In this study, we found that dihydromyricetin is a potent inhibitor targeting the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with a half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 1.716±0.419μM, using molecular docking and the FRET-based enzymatic assay. The binding pose of dihydromyricetin with SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) was identified using molecular docking method. In the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), the dihydrochromone ring of dihydromyricetin interact with the imidazole side chain of His163 through π-π stacking. The 1-oxygen of dihydromyricetin forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of Glu166. The 3-, 7-, 3’- and 4’-hydroxyl of dihydromyricetin interact with Gln189, Leu141, Arg188 and Thr190 through hydrogen bonds. Moreover, our results showed that dihydromyricetin can significantly alleviate BLM-induced pulmonary inflammation by inhibiting the infiltration of inflammation cells and the secretion of inflammation factors in the early process and also ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis by improving pulmonary function and down-regulate the expression of α-SMA and fibronectin in vivo. Our results also showed that dihydromyricetin inhibits the migration and activation of myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix production via transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/Smad signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: Dihydromyricetin is an effective inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and it prevents BLM-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mice. Dihydromyricetin will be a potential medicine for the treatment of COVID-19 and its sequelae.","Xiao, Ting; Wei, Yuli; Cui, Mengqi; Li, Xiaohe; Ruan, Hao; Zhang, Liang; Bao, Jiali; Ren, Shanfa; Gao, Dandi; Wang, Ming; Sun, Ronghao; Li, Mingjiang; Lin, Jianping; Li, Dongmei; Yang, Cheng; Zhou, Honggang",Phytomedicine,55,24

Production of CXCL8 correlated with plasmatic concentrations of LDH and D-dimer. Whole blood assays revealed that neutrophils from severe COVID-19 patients show a clear association with IgG immune complexes. Moreover, we found that sera from severe patients contain high levels of immune complexes and activate neutrophils through a mechanism partially dependent on FcγRII (CD32). Interestingly, when integrated in immune complexes, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from severe patients displayed a higher pro-inflammatory profile compared with antibodies from mild patients.

Currently, no studies have investigated the factors associated with social isolation and loneliness among community-dwelling older adults. Therefore, this study analyzed the association of social isolation and loneliness with socioeconomic, clinical, and health characteristics, and Covid-19-related variables, among community-dwelling older adults during the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted via a telephone survey of community-dwelling older adults aged ≥60 years in Macapa, Amapa, Brazil. A structured form was used to collect data. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed using Pearson's correlation test and a linear regression model. RESULTS: Participants comprised 86 community-dwelling older adults with a mean age of 71.78+6.98 years. Among them, 9.3% were diagnosed with Covid-19, of whom 3.5% were hospitalized. Most participants reported no difficulty obtaining food, medicines, or attending routine medical appointments during the pandemic. Furthermore, 23.3% (n=20) were socially isolated, and 20.9% (n=18) reported feelings of loneliness. The mean values for fear, anxiety, and obsession were 19.01±7.25, 1.01±1.90, and 2.84±3.28, respectively. A moderate positive correlation was identified between loneliness and the number of diseases, and a weak positive correlation between loneliness and the number of medications and depressive symptoms and risk for sarcopenia. The linear regression model indicated that higher loneliness scores were associated with a greater number of diseases (β=0.288; p=0.007).

Second, when we examine the specific influences of the variables, we find that authoritarianism, support for minority parties, religiosity, trust in SNS (social networking services), perceived risk, anxiety, negative emotions, blame attribution, the quantity of information, health status, and health after COVID-19, all positively influence beliefs in conspiracy theories. Conversely, support for President Moon Jae-In’s government, Christianity, trust in the government, perceived control, analytic thinking, knowledge, the quality of information, and gender, all negatively impact these beliefs.

METHODS: Presence of adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1–3, and respiratory syncytial virus was defined by positive PCR on nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens or a 4-fold rise in paired serology. We performed multiple imputation by developing a multivariable regression model for each virus using data from patients with available serology results. We calculated absolute and relative differences in the proportion of each virus detected comparing the imputed to observed (nonimputed) results.

Stakeholders must strengthen healthcare service provision by coming together to: better understand healthcare needs of underserved populations; strengthen medical training on care of autistic individuals; increase public awareness of ASD; promote research into/uptake of tools for ASD screening, diagnosis, and treatment; understand specific healthcare needs of autistic individuals in lower resource countries; and conduct longitudinal studies to understand the lifetime health, social, and economic impacts of ASD and enable the evaluation of novel approaches to increasing healthcare access. IMPACT: Despite the growing body of evidence, our understanding of barriers to healthcare encountered by individuals with ASD remains limited, particularly beyond childhood and in lower resource countries. We describe current and emerging barriers to healthcare access encountered by individuals with ASD across the lifespan. We recommend that stakeholders develop evidence-informed policies, programs, and technologies that address barriers to healthcare access for individuals with ASD and consider broad, equitable implementation to maximize impact.","Malik-Soni, Natasha; Shaker, Andrew; Luck, Helen; Mullin, Anne E.; Wiley, Ryan E.; Lewis, M.

Serotherapy reduces GvHD but potentially increases the risk of viral infection by delaying immune reconstitution. Because many PID patients have pre-existing viral infections, the optimal dose of serotherapy is unclear. We performed a retrospective analysis in 34 consecutive PID patients undergoing CBT and compared immune reconstitution, viral infection, GvHD, mortality, and long-term immune function between high-dose (n = 11) and low-dose (n = 9) serotherapy. Serotherapy dose had no effect on neutrophil engraftment. Median CD3(+) engraftment occurred at 92.5 and 97 days for high- and low-dose serotherapy, respectively. The low-dose serotherapy group had higher CD3(+), CD4(+), and early thymic emigrant counts at 4 months compared with the high-dose group. GvHD severity and number of viral infections did not differ between serotherapy doses. Survival from the transplantation process was 90.9% for high-dose and 100% for low-dose groups. In conclusion, low-dose serotherapy enhanced T cell reconstitution and thymopoiesis during the first year after CBT with no increase in GvHD.","Lane, Jonathan P.; Evans, Philippa T.G.; Nademi, Zohreh; Barge, Dawn; Jackson, Anthony; Hambleton, Sophie; Flood, Terry J.; Cant, Andrew J.; Abinun, Mario; Slatter, Mary A.; Gennery, Andrew R.",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,55,24

In such a setting, the use of telemedicine interventions has become extremely important. New technologies have proved helpful in pandemics as a solution to improve the quality of life in vulnerable patients such as persons with neurological diseases. Moreover, telemedicine interventions provide at-home solutions allowing clinicians to telemonitor and assess patients remotely, thus minimizing risk of infection. After a review of different studies using telemedicine in neurological patients, we propose a telemedicine process flow for healthcare of subjects with chronic neurological disease to respond to the new challenges for delivering quality healthcare during the transformation of public and private healthcare organizations around the world forced by COVID-19 pandemic contingency. This telemedicine process flow represents a replacement for in-person treatment and thereby the provision equitable access to the care of vulnerable people. It is conceptualized as comprehensive service including (1) teleassistance with patient counseling and medical treatment, (2) telemonitoring of patients' health conditions and any changes over time, as well as (3) telerehabilitation, i.e., interventions to assess and promote body functions, activities, and consecutively participation. The hereby proposed telemedicine process flow could be adopted on a large scale to improve the public health response during healthcare crises like the COVID-19 pandemic but could equally promote equitable health care independent of people's mobility or location with respect to the specialized health care center.","Matamala-Gomez, Marta; Bottiroli, Sara; Realdon, Olivia; Riva, Giuseppe; Galvagni, Lucia; Platz, Thomas; Sandrini, Giorgio; De Icco, Roberto; Tassorelli, Cristina",Front Neurol,55,24

Here, the emerging porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strain, isolated from Shanghai, China, broadly infects porcine, human and chicken cells in vitro. Previously studies by our group and others have confirmed that PDCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein performs an important role in antagonizing retinoic acid-induced gene I-like receptor (RLR) activation. However, the mechanism of PDCoV N protein suppressing porcine type I IFN production remains unclear, especially the downstream of porcine RLR signaling pathway. In the present study, porcine IRF7 (poIRF7) was identified as the interaction protein of PDCoV N protein through LC-MS/MS. The poIRF7 (268-487aa) was the key region of binding PDCoV N protein. Although IRF7 is a conserved functional protein in species, the PDCoV N protein has been confirmed to interact with only poIRF7 and significantly decrease poIRF7-induced type I IFN production, but not human or chicken IRF7. Furthermore, PDCoV N protein can promote poIRF7 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which directly increased the K6, K11, and K29-linked polyubiquitination of poIRF7. Lysine 359 of poIRF7 was a key site in PDCoV N protein inducing poIRF7 degradation. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism that PDCoV N protein could species-specifically interact with poIRF7 and then promote its degradation to suppress porcine type I IFN production. The novel findings provide a new insight into PDCoV and other zoonotic coronavirus evading the innate immune response of different species.","Ji, Likai; Wang, Na; Ma, Jingjiao; Cheng, Yuqiang; Wang, Hengan; Sun, Jianhe; Yan, Yaxian",Vet Microbiol,55,20

Therefore, we designed this study to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and the effectiveness and attitudes towards online education among Chinese children aged 7–15 years. METHODS: A detailed questionnaire, comprising of 62 questions was designed and parents or caretakers of 7 to 15 years old children were invited to participate via WeChat, a multi-purpose messaging, social media and mobile payment app, which is widely used by the Chinese population. A total of 668 parents across different regions of China were included. RESULTS: During COVID-19 pandemic, 20.7 and 7.2% children report experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. PTSD and SMFQ-P scores are significantly higher in middle school and boarding school students compared to primary and day school students. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that school system and province of origin are factors significantly associated with developing PSTD symptoms. 44.3% respondents feel online education is effective in gaining knowledge and improving practical and communications skills. 78.0% believe the online education system is efficient. Overall 79.8% respondents are satisfied and children can adapt to this new education system. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we found 1 in five children have PTSD and 1 in 14 children have depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: In summary, COVID-19 epidemic has caused PTSD and depression symptoms among Chinese children aged 7 to 15 years. In general, a large proportion of respondents are satisfied with online education, but still a substantial proportion of students are not comfortable with this new form of learning. Authorities should optimize online education systems and implement effective interventions to cope with the psychological effects of COVID-19 on children, as it is affecting the global population and remains uncertain when it will end.","Ma, Zhongren; Idris, Sakinah; Zhang, Yinxia; Zewen, Liu; Wali, Amaad; Ji, Yunpeng; Pan, Qiuwei; Baloch, Zulqarnain",BMC Pediatr,55,1

To combat the current pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), plant-based natural compounds are explored for their potential to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the cause of COVID-19. The present study is aimed at the investigation of antiviral action of several groups of phytoconstituents against SARS-CoV-2 using a molecular docking approach to inhibit Main Protease (Mpro) (PDB code: 6LU7) and spike (S) glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD) to ACE2 (PDB code: 6M0J) of SARS-CoV-2. For binding affinity evaluation, the docking scores were calculated using the Extra Precision (XP) protocol of the Glide docking module of Maestro. CovDock was also used to investigate covalent docking. The OPLS3e force field was used in simulations. The docking score was calculated by preferring the conformation of the ligand that has the lowest binding free energy (best pose). The results are indicative of better potential of solanine, acetoside, and rutin, as Mpro and spike glycoprotein RBD dual inhibitors. Acetoside and curcumin were found to inhibit Mpro covalently. Curcumin also possessed all the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters in the range. Thus, phytochemicals like solanine, acetoside, rutin, and curcumin hold potential to be developed as treatment options against COVID-19.","Teli, Divya M.; Shah, Mamta B.; Chhabria, Mahesh T.",Front Mol Biosci,55,16

COVID-19 exhibits a strong human-to-human transmission infectivity and could cause acute respiratory diseases. Asymptomatic carriers are able to infect other healthy persons, and this poses a challenge for public health; the World Health Organization (WHO) has already announced COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Nucleic acid testing, considered as the current primary method for diagnosing COVID-19, might lead to false negatives and is difficult to be applied for every suspected patient because of the existence of asymptomatic carriers. Meanwhile, detecting specific antibodies in blood, such as the IgM antibody, against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is another choice for COVID-19 diagnosis, as it is widely accepted that IgM is an important indicator in the acute infection period. In this study, a colloidal gold nanoparticle-based lateral-flow (AuNP-LF) assay was developed to achieve rapid diagnosis and on-site detection of the IgM antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the indirect immunochromatography method. For preparing AuNP-LF strips, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (SARS-CoV-2 NP) was coated on an analytical membrane for sample capture, and antihuman IgM was conjugated with AuNPs to form the detecting reporter. Optimization of AuNP-LF assay was carried out by altering the pH value and the amount of antihuman IgM. The performance of AuNP-LF assay was evaluated by testing serum samples of COVID-19 patients and normal humans. The results were compared with the real-time polymerase chain reaction. The sensitivity and specificity of AuNP-LF assay were determined to be 100 and 93.3%, respectively, and an almost perfect agreement was exhibited by Kappa statistics (κ coefficient = 0.872). AuNP-LF assay showed outstanding selectivity in the detection of IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 virus with no interference from other viruses such as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) and dengue virus (DFV). AuNP-LF assay was able to achieve results within 15 min and needed only 10–20 μL serum for each test. As a whole, in the light of its advantages such as excellent specificity and stability, easy operation, low cost, and being less time-consuming, AuNP-LF assay is a feasible method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in primary hospitals and laboratories, especially in emergency situations in which numerous samples need to be tested on time.","Huang, Chao; Wen, Tian; Shi, Feng-Juan; Zeng, Xiao-Yan; Jiao, Yong-Jun",ACS Omega,55,23

In this paper, we explore how governments can fulfill an important need as suppliers of liquidity. Building on the financing advantage view of state ownership, we theorize how state-owned enterprises (SOEs) may provide capital by offering trade credit to customer firms. The data indicate a positive relation between the level of state ownership and the provision of trade credit. Using an institution-focused framework, we further determine that the nation’s institutional environment systematically affects the opportunities and motivations for SOEs to grant trade credit. Specifically, we find that SOEs grant more trade credit in countries with less developed financial markets, weaker legal protection of creditors, less comprehensive information-sharing mechanisms, more collectivist societies, left-wing governments, and higher levels of unemployment. Firm-level factors also influence the credit-granting decisions of SOEs, with SOEs with lower levels of state ownership and higher extents of internationalization offering lower amounts of trade credit. Overall, our study offers novel insights regarding the important role of state-owned firms as providers of liquidity.

Adherence to standard treatment guidelines (STG) can help provide more consistent and correct diagnoses and treatments and limit the irrational use of medicines and the negative health consequences that can occur as a result. The purpose of this study was to investigate prescribers’ adherence of their diagnoses and respective treatments to national STG and to identify potential areas for planning interventions. METHODS: A cross-sectional study on prescribers’ adherence to diagnosis and treatment, according to national STG, was conducted in 2012 in public primary healthcare facilities (HCF) in the Dodoma region of Tanzania. Information on 2886 patients was collected, prospectively and retrospectively, from 120 HCF across the Dodoma region using a structured questionnaire. Twenty-five broadly defined main illness groups were recorded and the nine most prevalent and relevant conditions were statistically analysed in detail. RESULTS: Diagnoses and related treatments were recorded and analysed in 2872 cases. The nine most prevalent conditions were upper respiratory tract infections (25%), malaria (18%), diarrhoea (9.9%), pneumonia (6.1%), skin problems (5.8%), gastrointestinal diagnoses (5%), urinary tract infections (4%), worm infestations (3.6%) and eye problems (2.1%). Only 1.8% of all diagnoses were non-communicable diseases. The proportion of prescribers’ primary diagnoses that completely adhered to national STG was 599 (29.9%), those that partially adhered totalled 775 (38.7%), wrong medication was given in 621 cases (30.9%) and no diagnosis or medication was given in nine cases (0.5%). Sixty-one percent of all patients received an antibiotic regardless of the diagnoses. Complete adherence was highest when worms were diagnosed and lowest for diarrhoea. The proportion of cases that did not adhere to STG was highest with patients with skin problems and lowest for malaria. CONCLUSION: Prescribers’ general adherence to national STG in primary HCF in the public sector in Dodoma region is sub-optimal. The reasons are multifaceted and focused attention, directed at improving prescribing and pharmacotherapy, is required with a view of improving patient care and health outcomes.

Previous studies on chemokines have included only small numbers of patients, and the utility of plasma chemokines as prognostic indicators is unclear. Methods: We studied 255 archival plasma samples collected during the first or second week after disease onset. The chemokines interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), monokine induced by interferon-γ (MIG), interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were measured by cytometric bead array with a 4-color FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical staining were performed to analyze the production of IP-10 in lung tissue at autopsy. Conditional logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors for adverse disease outcome. Results: Increases in IP-10, MIG, and IL-8 during the first week after onset of fever were associated with adverse outcome (intensive care unit admission or death) in the univariate analysis. During the second week, only MIG concentration was associated with prognosis. After adjusting for other risk factors, plasma IP-10 concentration at the first week remained as an independent prognostic factor, with an odds ratio for adverse outcome of 1.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.05–2.55) per fold increase in plasma IP-10 concentration above the median. During the second week, chemokines provided little independent prognostic information. IP-10 was increased in lung tissue from patients who died of SARS. Conclusions: Increased plasma IP-10 during the first week of SARS symptoms is an independent predictor of outcome. Chemokine activation may be an early event in SARS, and an exaggerated host response may produce complications.","Tang, Nelson Leung-Sang; Chan, Paul Kay-Sheung; Wong, Chun-Kwok; To, Ka-Fai; Wu, Alan Ka-Lun; Sung, Ying-Man; Hui, David Shu-Cheong; Sung, Joseph Jao-Yiu; Lam, Christopher Wai-Kei",Clin Chem,55,1

This two-wave longitudinal study performed in Italy aimed to explore people’s perceptions of changes in healthy and unhealthy food consumption before and during the first lockdown and the possible persistence of such changes after its official end, as a function of the number of people cohabiting, negative emotion activation, and individual eating styles. A total of 728 Italian adults completed self-reported food consumption measures and related psychological variables at both time points. In the lockdown period, participants reported an increase in healthy food consumption and involvement in cooking and a decrease in the consumption of junk food. This general pattern was stronger for both young and restrained eaters. The intensity of negative emotions and the number of cohabitants were not associated with the examined behaviour. In the post-lockdown period, the new consumption pattern acquired during the confinement was partially discontinued: participants cut down their healthy food consumption as well as their involvement in food preparation, but they continued to reduce their junk food intake. These results suggest that people’s food consumption patterns can easily improve when the situation is favourable (e.g., more time and opportunities for cooking healthy meals) and offer an interesting theoretical contribution to understanding the factors useful in promoting healthy eating, in the event of a future outbreak.","Caso, Daniela; Guidetti, Margherita; Capasso, Miriam; Cavazza, Nicoletta",Food Qual Prefer,55,10

Chemically modified 5′ cap structures have provided access to mRNAs with superior translational properties that could benefit the currently flourishing mRNA field. Prime examples of compounds that enhance mRNA properties are antireverse cap analog diastereomers that contain an O-to-S substitution within the β-phosphate (β-S-ARCA D1 and D2), where D1 is used in clinically investigated mRNA vaccines. The compounds were previously found to have high affinity for eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and augment translation in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular basis for the beneficial “thio-effect” remains unclear. Here, we employed multiple biophysical techniques and captured 11 cap analog-eIF4E crystallographic structures to investigate the consequences of the β-O-to-S or -Se substitution on the interaction with eIF4E. We determined the S(P)/R(P) configurations of β-S-ARCA and related compounds and obtained structural insights into the binding. Unexpectedly, in both stereoisomers, the β-S/Se atom occupies the same binding cavity between Lys162 and Arg157, indicating that the key driving force for complex stabilization is the interaction of negatively charged S/Se with positively charged amino acids. This was observed for all structural variants of the cap and required significantly different conformations of the triphosphate for each diastereomer. This finding explains why both β-S-ARCA diastereomers have higher affinity for eIF4E than unmodified caps. Binding affinities determined for di-, tri-, and oligonucleotide cap analogs suggested that the “thio-effect” was preserved in longer RNAs. Our observations broaden the understanding of thiophosphate biochemistry and enable the rational design of translationally active mRNAs and eIF4E-targeting drugs.","Warminski, Marcin; Kowalska, Joanna; Nowak, Elzbieta; Kubacka, Dorota; Tibble, Ryan; Kasprzyk, Renata; Sikorski, Pawel J.; Gross, John D.; Nowotny, Marcin; Jemielity, Jacek",ACS Chem Biol,55,26

METHODS: We piloted the collection of nasal mid-turbinate swabs amenable to self-testing, including both standard polyester flocked swabs as well as 3D printed plastic lattice swabs, placed into either viral transport media or an RNA stabilization agent. Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 viral detection by RT-qPCR was compared to that obtained by nasopharyngeal sampling as the reference standard. Pooling specimens in the lab versus pooling swabs at the point of collection was also evaluated. RESULTS: Among 275 participants, flocked nasal swabs identified 104/121 individuals who were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal sampling (sensitivity 87%, 95% CI 79–92%), mostly missing those with low viral load (<10^3 viral copies/uL). 3D-printed nasal swabs showed similar sensitivity. When nasal swabs were placed directly into an RNA stabilizer, the mean 1.4 log decrease in viral copies/uL compared to nasopharyngeal samples was reduced to <1 log, even when samples were left at room temperature for up to 7 days. Pooling sample specimens or swabs both successfully detected samples >10(2) viral copies/uL. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal swabs are likely adequate for clinical diagnosis of acute infections to help expand testing capacity in resource-constrained settings.

MAIN TEXT: The reorganization of allergy clinics should include programmed checks for severe and poorly controlled patients, application of digital medicine service for mild-to-moderate disease in well-controlled ones, postponement of non urgent diagnostic work-ups and domiciliation of therapies, whenever possible. As far as therapies, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) should not be stopped and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) fits perfectly for this purpose, since a drug home-delivery service can be activated for the entire pandemic duration. Moreover, biologic agents for severe asthma, chronic spontaneous urticaria and atopic dermatitis should be particularly encouraged to achieve best control possible of severe disease in times of COVID-19 and, whenever possible, home-delivery and self-administration should be the preferred choice. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic, allergists have the responsibility of balancing individual patients’ needs with public health issues, and innovative tools, such as telemedicine and digital medicine services, can be helpful to reduce the risk of viral spreading while delivering up-to-date personalized care.","Malipiero, Giacomo; Heffler, Enrico; Pelaia, Corrado; Puggioni, Francesca; Racca, Francesca; Ferri, Sebastian; Spinello, Lina; Merigo, Morena; Lamacchia, Donatella; Cataldo, Giuseppe; Sansonna, Melissa; Canonica, Giorgio Walter; Paoletti, Giovanni",Clin Transl Allergy,55,26

We provide a critical review of the literature with special emphasis on presentation, proposed mechanisms of disease, and treatment of neurological involvement in APS. RECENT FINDINGS: Although stroke is the most common cause of neurological manifestations in patients with APS, other neurological disorders have been increasingly associated with the disease, including cognitive dysfunction, headache, and epilepsy. Direct oral anticoagulants have failed to show non-inferiority compared to vitamin K antagonists for the prevention of major thrombotic events. Antiphospholipid antibodies are often found in patients with acute COVID-19 but clear evidence supporting an association between these antibodies and the risk of thrombotic events, including stroke and cerebral venous thrombosis, is still lacking. SUMMARY: APS patients may present with several distinct neurological manifestations. New criteria will facilitate the classification of patients presenting with increasingly recognized non-criteria neurological manifestations.","Leal Rato, Miguel; Bandeira, Matilde; Romão, Vasco C.; Aguiar de Sousa, Diana",Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,55,16

However a more nuanced picture of these interventions’ effects on epidemic trajectories is necessary. By mathematical modeling each as reactive quarantine measures, dependent on current infection rates, with different mechanisms of action, we analytically derive distinct nonlinear effects of these interventions on final and peak outbreak size. We simultaneously fit the model to provincial reported case and aggregated quarantined contact data from China. Lockdowns compressed the outbreak in China inversely proportional to population quarantine rates, revealing their critical dependence on timing. Contact tracing had significantly less impact on final outbreak size, but did lead to peak size reduction. Our analysis suggests that altering the cumulative cases in a rapidly spreading outbreak requires sustained interventions that decrease the reproduction number close to one, otherwise some type of swift lockdown measure may be needed.","Browne, Cameron J.; Gulbudak, Hayriye; Macdonald, Joshua C.",J Theor Biol,55,10

Only three steps are included in this method: (i) construct viral genome-encoding plasmids in vitro by one-step Gibson assembly; (ii) transform the assembled DNA products into R. radiobacter; (iii) inoculate plants with the R. radiobacter clones containing the viral genome. Stable infectious clones were obtained from two potyviruses papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) and papaya leaf distortion mosaic virus (PLDMV) using this method, whereas attempts utilizing ""classical"" E. coli cloning system failed repeatedly.

Beyond the efficacy against severe disease and symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, understanding vaccine efficacy against virus transmission, including efficacy against transmission of different viral variants, will help model epidemic trajectory and determine appropriate control measures. Recent studies have proposed using random virologic testing in individual randomized controlled trials to improve estimation of vaccine efficacy against infection. We propose to further use the viral load measures from these tests to estimate efficacy against transmission. This estimation requires a model of the relationship between viral load and transmissibility and assumptions about the vaccine effect on transmission and the progress of the epidemic. We describe these key assumptions, potential violations of them, and solutions that can be implemented to mitigate these violations. Assessing these assumptions and implementing this random sampling, with viral load measures, will enable better estimation of the crucial measure of vaccine efficacy against transmission.","Kennedy-Shaffer, Lee; Kahn, Rebecca; Lipsitch, Marc",Epidemiology,55,1

This retrospective study aims to analyze the clinical features of COVID-19 patients with cancer and identify death outcome related risk factors. METHODS: From February 10th to April 15th, 2020, 103 COVID-19 patients with cancer were enrolled. Difference analyses were performed between severe and non-severe patients. A propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed, including 103 COVID-19 patients with cancer and 206 matched non-cancer COVID-19 patients. Next, we identified death related risk factors and developed a nomogram for predicting the probability. RESULTS: In 103 COVID-19 patients with cancer, the main cancer categories were breast cancer, lung cancer and bladder cancer. Compared to non-severe patients, severe patients had a higher median age, and a higher proportion of smokers, diabetes, heart disease and dyspnea. In addition, most of the laboratory results between two groups were significantly different. PSM analysis found that the proportion of dyspnea was much higher in COVID-19 patients with cancer. The severity incidence in two groups were similar, while a much higher mortality was found in COVID-19 patients with cancer compared to that in COVID-19 patients without cancer (11.7% vs. 4.4%, P = 0.028). Furthermore, we found that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were related to death outcome. And a nomogram based on the factors was developed. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients with cancer, the clinical features and laboratory results between severe group and non-severe group were significantly different.

The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Resilience Task Force collaboration aimed to provide contemporaneous reports on the impact of COVID-19 on the lived experiences and well-being in oncology. METHODS: This online anonymous survey (July-August 2020) is the second of a series of global surveys launched during the course of the pandemic. Longitudinal key outcome measures including well-being/distress (expanded Well-being Index—9 items), burnout (1 item from expanded Well-being Index), and job performance since COVID-19 were tracked. RESULTS: A total of 942 participants from 99 countries were included for final analysis: 58% (n = 544) from Europe, 52% (n = 485) female, 43% (n = 409) ≤40 years old, and 36% (n = 343) of non-white ethnicity.

Host cells produce cytokines and chemokines in response to viral infection, and among such effector molecules, type I interferons are the principal antiviral cytokines and therefore effective targets for viruses to disarm host surveillance. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) expresses proteins that circumvent the IFN response and other cellular processes, and to compensate the small coding capacity of PRRSV, these proteins are multifunctional. To date, at least four viral proteins have been identified and studied as viral antagonists of host defenses: N as a structural protein and three non-structural proteins, Nsp1 (Nsp1α and Nsp1β), Nsp2, and Nsp11. Among these, N and Nsp1 are nuclear-cytoplasmic proteins distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells. Nsp1 and Nsp2 are viral proteases while Nsp11 is an endoribonuclease. This review describes the current understanding of the role of these proteins in modulating the host innate immune responses. Blocking against virus-mediated inhibition of the innate response may lead to the future development of effective vaccines. The understanding of viral mechanisms modulating the normal cellular processes will be a key to the design of an effective control strategy for PRRS.","Yoo, Dongwan; Song, Cheng; Sun, Yan; Du, Yijun; Kim, Oekyung; Liu, Hsiao-Ching",Virus Res,55,1

We analyzed the selective events that accompanied the divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13. To this end, we applied a population genetics-phylogenetics approach, which leverages within-population variation and divergence from an outgroup. Results indicated that most sites in the viral open reading frames (ORFs) evolved under conditions of strong to moderate purifying selection. The most highly constrained sequences corresponded to some nonstructural proteins (nsps) and to the M protein. Conversely, nsp1 and accessory ORFs, particularly ORF8, had a nonnegligible proportion of codons evolving under conditions of very weak purifying selection or close to selective neutrality. Overall, limited evidence of positive selection was detected. The 6 bona fide positively selected sites were located in the N protein, in ORF8, and in nsp1. A signal of positive selection was also detected in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein but most likely resulted from a recombination event that involved the BatCoV RaTG13 sequence. In line with previous data, we suggest that the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13 encoded/encodes an RBM similar to that observed in SARS-CoV-2 itself and in some pangolin viruses. It is presently unknown whether the common ancestor still exists and, if so, which animals it infects. Our data, however, indicate that divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13 was accompanied by limited episodes of positive selection, suggesting that the common ancestor of the two viruses was poised for human infection. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are dangerous zoonotic pathogens; in the last 2 decades, three coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and caused human epidemics. One of these is the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. We investigated how, since its divergence from a closely related bat virus, natural selection shaped the genome of SARS-CoV-2. We found that distinct coding regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome evolved under conditions of different degrees of constraint and are consequently more or less prone to tolerate amino acid substitutions. In practical terms, the level of constraint provides indications about which proteins/protein regions are better suited as possible targets for the development of antivirals or vaccines. We also detected limited signals of positive selection in three viral ORFs. However, we warn that, in the absence of knowledge about the chain of events that determined the human spillover, these signals should not be necessarily interpreted as evidence of an adaptation to our species.","Cagliani, Rachele; Forni, Diego; Clerici, Mario; Sironi, Manuela",J Virol,55,2

We aim to describe the long-term outcomes of survivors of hospitalization for COVID-19 followed up first at an outpatient facility and subsequently by telephone. METHODS: Observational prospective study conducted at a tertiary general hospital. Clinical and radiological progression was assessed and data recorded on a standardized reporting form. Patients were divided into three groups according to PaO2/FiO2 at hospitalization: PaO2/FiO2 > 300, PaO2/FiO2 300-200 and PaO2/FiO2 < 200. A logistic multivariate regression model was performed to identify factors associated with persistence of symptoms. RESULTS: Facility follow-up: 302 patients were enrolled. Median follow-up was 45 days after discharge; 78% (228/294) of patients had COVID-19-related symptoms (53% asthenia, 56% respiratory symptoms) and 40% (122/302) had residual pulmonary radiographic lesions. PaO2/FiO2 <200 was an independent predictor of persistent dyspnea; OR = 1.87 (1.38 to 2.52), (p <0.0001). PaO2/FiO2 >300 was associated with resolution of chest radiographic lesions; OR = 0.56 (0.42 to 0.74), (p <0.0001). Fifty per cent of patients required specific medical follow-up after the first consultation and were transferred to another physician. Telephone follow-up: 294 patients were contacted after a median time follow-up of 7 months. Fifty per cent of patients (147/294) still presented symptoms and 49% (145/294) psychological disorders. Asthenia was identified in 27% (78/294) and dyspnea in 10% (28/294) of patients independently of PaO2/FiO2.

At the onset of the pandemic, Swedish upper-secondary schools moved to online instruction, while lower-secondary schools remained open. This allows for a comparison of parents and teachers differently exposed to open and closed schools, but otherwise facing similar conditions. Leveraging rich Swedish register data, we connect all students and teachers in Sweden to their families and study the impact of moving to online instruction on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We find that, among parents, exposure to open rather than closed schools resulted in a small increase in PCR-confirmed infections (odds ratio [OR] 1.17; 95% CI [CI95] 1.03 to 1.32). Among lower-secondary teachers, the infection rate doubled relative to upper-secondary teachers (OR 2.01; CI95 1.52 to 2.67). This spilled over to the partners of lower-secondary teachers, who had a higher infection rate than their upper-secondary counterparts (OR 1.29; CI95 1.00 to 1.67). When analyzing COVID-19 diagnoses from healthcare visits and the incidence of severe health outcomes, results are similar for teachers, but weaker for parents and teachers’ partners. The results for parents indicate that keeping lower-secondary schools open had minor consequences for the overall transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in society. The results for teachers suggest that measures to protect teachers could be considered.","Vlachos, Jonas; Hertegård, Edvin; B. Svaleryd, Helena",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,55,21

Therefore, developing approaches for maintaining or enhancing human sperm motility has been an important area of investigation. In this review we discuss the physiology of sperm, molecular pathways regulating sperm motility, risk factors affecting sperm motility, and the role of sperm motility in fertility outcomes. In addition, we discuss various pharmacological agents and biomolecules that can enhance sperm motility in vitro and in vivo conditions to improve assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes.

DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, LiLACs and African Index Medicus to June 2009-March 2016. RESULTS: 226 studies from 50 countries met our inclusion criteria. Mortality associated with H1N1-related critical illness was 31% (95% CI 28–34). Reported mortality was highest in South Asia (61% [95% CI 50–71]) and Sub-Saharan Africa (53% [95% CI 29–75]), in comparison to Western Europe (25% [95% CI 22–30]), North America (25% [95% CI 22–27]) and Australia (15% [95% CI 13–18]) (P<0.0001). High income economies had significantly lower reported mortality compared to upper middle income economies and lower middle income economies respectively (P<0.0001). Mortality for the first wave was non-significantly higher than wave two (P = 0.66). There was substantial variability in reported mortality among the specific subgroups of patients: unselected critically ill adults (27% [95% CI 24–30]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (37% [95% CI 32–44]), acute kidney injury (44% [95% CI 26–64]), and critically ill pregnant patients (10% [95% CI 5–19]). CONCLUSION: Reported mortality for outbreaks and pandemics may vary substantially depending upon selected patient characteristics, the number of patients described, and the region and economic status of the outbreak location.

However, recent outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) implicated in causing multiple ocular abnormalities, such as conjunctivitis, retinal hemorrhages, chorioretinal atrophy, posterior uveitis, optic neuritis, and maculopathies, has rejuvenated a significant interest in understanding the pathogenesis of flaviviruses, including ZIKV, in the eye. In this review, first, we summarize the current knowledge of the major flaviviruses (Dengue, West Nile, Yellow Fever, and Japanese Encephalitis) reported to cause ocular manifestations in humans with emphasis on recent ZIKV outbreaks. Second, being an immune privilege organ, the eye is protected from systemic infections by the presence of blood-retinal barriers (BRB). Hence, we discuss how flaviviruses modulate retinal innate response and breach the protective BRB to cause ocular or retinal pathology. Finally, we describe recently identified infection signatures of ZIKV and discuss whether these system biology-predicted genes or signaling pathways (e.g., cellular metabolism) could contribute to the pathogenesis of ocular manifestations and assist in the development of ocular antiviral therapies against ZIKV and other flaviviruses.","Singh, Sneha; Kumar, Ashok",Viruses,55,23

Background: Skiing in avalanche terrain is a voluntary activity that exposes the participant to potentially fatal risk. Impaired decision-making in this context can therefore have devastating results, often with limited prior corrective feedback and learning opportunities. Previous research has suggested that arousal caused by emotions affects risk assessment and intentions to engage in risky behavior. We propose that powder fever may induce similar responses. Methods: We used the following two experimental methods: laboratory studies with visual visceral stimuli (ski movies) and a field study with real stimuli (skiing exciting terrain). We evaluated the effect of emotions on attention, risk assessment, and willingness to expose oneself and others to risk. Results: Both the laboratory studies and the field study showed that skiing-related stimuli had a relatively strong effect on reported emotions. However, we found very few significant effects on decision-making or assessment of risk. Conclusions: Skiing activities make people happier. However, despite the clear parallels to sexual arousal, powder fever does not appear to significantly impair decision-making in our study. More research on the effects of powder fewer on milder forms of risk-taking behavior is needed.","Mannberg, Andrea; Hendrikx, Jordy; Johnson, Jerry; Hetland, Audun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,55,8

Participants underwent the face–word Stroop tasks during which event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The N2, N3, P3, and late positive component (LPC) were investigated. The results showed that calm music and happy music effectively regulate young adults’ induced negative emotions, while young adults experienced more negative emotions when listening to sad music; the negative mood states at the post-induction phase inhibited the reaction of conflict control in face–word Stroop tasks, which manifested as lower accuracy (ACC) and slower reaction times (RTs).

Cardiac arrhythmia has been concerned as important safety issue for HCQ. The aim of this study was to investigate whether hydroxychloroquine increases new-onset arrhythmia among patients with RA, SLE or SS. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study that conducted from the longitudinal health insurance database of Taiwan. Patients with newly diagnosed RA, SLE or SS with age ≥20 years old were selected from 2000 to 2012. Patients who received HCQ and without HCQ treatment groups were matched by propensity score to minimize the effect of selection bias and confounders. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze the risk of arrhythmia between the two groups after controlling for related variables. RESULTS: A total of 15892 patients were selected to participate and finally 3575 patients were enrolled in each group after matching. There was no different risk of all arrhythmia in patients using HCQ than without HCQ (adjusted hazards ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.61–1.07) and ventricular arrhythmia as well. The incidence of arrhythmia did not increase when HCQ co-administrated with macrolides. The arrhythmia risk was also not different regardless of daily HCQ dose <400mg or ≥400mg or follow-up duration of ≦4 months or >4 months.

Key among them has been surge preparation to increase both acute care hospital availability and staffing, while utilizing state and federal waivers to provide appropriate and efficient delivery of care. As a large health system in New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, we were faced with these challenges early on, including the need to rapidly transition patients from acute care beds in order to provide bed capacity for the acute care hospitals. Rehabilitation Medicine has always played an essential role in the continuum of care, establishing functional goals while identifying patients for post-acute care planning. During this crisis, this expertise, and the overwhelming need to adapt and facilitate patient transitions, resulted in a collaborative process to efficiently assess patients for post-acute care needs. We worked closely with our skilled nursing facility, home care partners, and an acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital to adapt their admissions processes to the COVID-19 patient population, all the while grappling with varying access to vital supplies, testing and manpower. As the patient criteria were established, rapid pathways were created to post-acute care, and we were able to create much needed bed capacity in our acute care hospitals.","Levin, Sheryl R.; Gitkind, Andrew I.; Bartels, Matthew N.",Arch Phys Med Rehabil,55,5

The possibilities of treatment have been reviewed in recent publications but there are many controversial results and conclusions. An analysis of the studies did not reveal a difference in mortality level between people treated with standard therapy, such as antiviral drugs and dexamethasone, and new antiviral drugs/additional immune therapy. However, most studies describe clinical improvement and a decrease in mortality among patients with severe and critical conditions, with the early initiation of additional immune therapy. Possible new targets based on viral life cycles were considered. Unfortunately, the data analysis on the efficacy of different medicine and therapy regimens among patients with COVID-19, showed little success in decreasing the mortality rate in all treatment methods. Some efficacy has been shown with an immunosuppressive therapy in small patient samples, but when a larger number of patients were analyzed the data did not differ significantly from the control groups.","Starshinova, Anna; Malkova, Anna; Zinchenko, Ulia; Kudlay, Dmitry; Glushkova, Anzhela; Dovgalyk, Irina; Yablonskiy, Piotr; Shoenfeld, Yehuda",Life (Basel),55,18

The Healthy Action to Benefit Independence and Thinking (HABIT) program is a cognitive rehabilitation and wellness program for patients with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and their partners that involves groups of up to 32 people (16 dyads) at a time. Thus, the public health recommendation to avoid groups at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic immediately impacted our ability to offer this treatment protocol. This brief report provides patient and partner satisfaction data as well as clinical outcomes with a virtual adaptation of the HABIT program developed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of their participation, patients who attended in-person sessions had an average age of 74.4 years and those who attended virtual sessions had an average age of 75.4 years (P=.60). Both groups had an average of 16.3 years of education (P=.95). Approximately half of the patients in both groups were male (30 of 57 [53%]), most were White (54 of 57 [95%]) and were accompanied to the program by a spouse (50 of 57 [88%]). Overall, patient and partner satisfaction with the HABIT program remained high, ranging from a mean score of 5.8 to 6.6 on a rating scale of 1 to 7 for patients and partners, and clinical outcomes remained consistent with our face-to-face formatting when compared with pre–COVID pandemic sessions. The most notable changes across both formats were improvements in patient anxiety (Cohen's d=0.25 face-to-face; d=0.39 virtual), partner anxiety (d=0.37 face-to-face; d=0.34 virtual), and partner depression (d=0.37 face-to-face; d=0.35 virtual). This preliminary program evaluation suggests that transitioning the HABIT program to virtual formatting provides high-quality care similar to our in-person care models. Ongoing program evaluation is planned as we continue using virtual treatment for safety. Even after COVID-19 pandemic public health restrictions are lifted, these findings will have continued relevance to ongoing demand for telehealth.","Locke, Dona E.C.; Khayoun, Renata; Shandera-Ochsner, Anne L.; Cuc, Andrea; Eilertsen, Jeanne; Caselli, Maria; Abrew, Karina; Chandler, Melanie J.",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,55,24

Lockdowns influence contact among persons within or between populations including restricting travel, closing schools, prohibiting public gatherings, requiring workplace closures, all designed to slow the contagion of the virus. The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of lockdown measures on the spread of covid-19 and test a theoretical model of the covid-19 pandemic employing structural equation modelling. METHODS: Lockdown variables, population demographics, mortality rates, infection rates, and health were obtained for eight countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The dataset, owid-covid-data.csv, was downloaded on 06/01/2020 from: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data. Infection spread and mortality data were depicted as logistic growth and analyzed with stepwise multiple regression. The overall structure of the covid-19 data was explored through factor analyses leading to a theoretical model that was tested using latent variable path analysis. RESULTS: Multiple regression indicated that the time from lockdown had a small but significant effect (β = 0.112, p< 0.01) on reducing the number of cases per million. The stringency index produced the most important effect for mortality and infection rates (β = 0.588,β = 0.702, β = 0.518, β = 0.681; p< 0.01). Exploratory and confirmatory analyses resulted in meaningful and cohesive latent variables: 1) Mortality, 2) Infection Spread, 3) Pop Health Risk, and 4) Health Vulnerability (Comparative Fit Index = 0.91; Standardized Root Mean Square Residual = 0.08). DISCUSSION: The stringency index had a large impact on the growth of covid-19 infection and mortality rates as did percentage of population aged over 65, median age, per capita GDP, diabetes prevalence, cardiovascular death rates, and ICU hospital beds per 100K. The overall Latent Variable Path Analysis is theoretically meaningful and coherent with acceptable fit indices as a model of the covid-19 pandemic.","Violato, Claudio; Violato, Emilio Mauro; Violato, Efrem Mauro",PLoS One,55,22

In this research, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues of two leucine zipper coiled-coil (LZCC) structural proteins, cGKIα(1−59) and MBS(CT35) are dispositioned on the wenxiang diagrams according to heptad repeat pattern (abcdefg)(n), respectively. Their wenxiang diagrams clearly demonstrate that the residues with same repeat letters are laid on same side of the spiral diagrams, where most hydrophobic residues are positioned at a and d, and most hydrophilic residues are localized on b, c, e, f and g polar position regions. The wenxiang diagrams of a dimetric LZCC can be represented by the combination of two monomeric wenxiang diagrams, and the wenxiang diagrams of the two LZCC (tetramer) complex structures can also be assembled by using two pairs of their wenxiang diagrams. Furthermore, by comparing the wenxiang diagrams of cGKIα(1−59) and MBS(CT35), the interaction between cGKIα(1−59) and MBS(CT35) is suggested to be weaker. By analyzing the wenxiang diagram of the cGKIα(1−59.)·MBS(CT42) complex structure, most affected residues of cGKIα(1−59) by the interaction with MBS(CT42) are proposed at positions d, a, e and g of the LZCC structure.

We discover that in the human interactome, the human proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the genes that are differentially expressed after the infection have common neighbors central in the interactome that may be key to the disease mechanisms. We uncover 185 new drug–target interactions targeting 49 of these key genes and suggest re-purposing of 149 FDA-approved drugs, including drugs targeting VEGF and nitric oxide signaling, whose pathways coincide with the observed COVID-19 symptoms.

Recent studies suggest that different formulas may lead to different tidal volume and PEEP settings. The aim of this study is to compare 3 different inspiratory PL measurement method; direct measurement (PL(D)), elastance derived (PL(E)) and release derived (PL(R)) methods in patients with multiple mechanical abnormalities. 34 patients were included in this prospective observational study. Measurements were obtained during volume controlled mechanical ventilation in sedated and paralyzed patients. During the study day airway and eosephageal pressures, flow, tidal volume were measured and elastance, inspiratory PL(E), PL(D) and PL(R) were calculated. Mean age of the patients was 67 ± 15 years and APACHE II score was 27 ± 7. Most frequent diagnosis of the patients were pneumonia (71%), COPD exacerbation(56%), pleural effusion (55%) and heart failure(50%). Mean plateau pressure of the patients was 22 ± 5 cmH(2)O and mean respiratory system elastance was 36.7 ± 13 cmH(2)O/L. E(L)/E(RS)% was 0.75 ± 0.35%. Mean expiratory transpulmonary pressure was 0.54 ± 7.7 cmH(2)O (min: − 21, max: 12). Mean PL(E) (18 ± 9 H(2)O) was significantly higher than PL(D) (13 ± 9 cmH(2)O) and PL(R) methods (11 ± 9 cmH(2)O). There was a good aggreement and there was no bias between the measurements in Bland–Altman analysis. The estimated bias was similar between the PL(D) and PL(E) (− 3.12 ± 11 cmH(2)O) and PL(E) and PL(R) (3.9 ± 10.9 cmH(2)O) measurements.

However, disease prevalence in IBD patients is presently unknown. In this prospective observational study we aimed at determining SARS-CoV2 infection prevalence in IBD patients treated with biological therapy. METHODS: 354 sera from IBD patients under biological therapy recruited from three different locations in Italy and Germany were evaluated for antibody presence by RBD ELISA. Control groups were i) age-matched healthy subjects tested in the same time period in Milan, Italy; ii) healthy subjects collected in the pre-COVID era; iii) IBD patients under biological therapy collected in the pre-COVID era. RESULTS: 8 out of 354 patients tested positive for the anti-RBD-SARS-CoV2 IgG antibody (prevalence 2.3%). IgG positive patients’ percentage recruited from Milan was significantly higher than those recruited from other locations (prevalence 5.4% vs. 0.4% p < 0.005). IgG positive patients reported a significantly higher incidence of fever, anosmia and ageusia, and were more likely to have entered in close contact with COVID-19 positive subjects before the study enrolment.

METHODS: This was a time series analysis of visits to 7 EDs in greater Chicago, Illinois from October 20, 2019 to July 25, 2020. We compared the number of ED visits for opioid-related diagnoses in the time period preceding the World Health Organization pandemic declaration (prepandemic period, October 20, 2019–July 3, 2020) to the time period following the World Health Organization declaration (pandemic period, March 8, 2020 to July 25, 2020) using a single-group interrupted time series analysis with Newey-West standard errors. We also present data on alcohol-related ED visits for comparison. RESULTS: We evaluated a total of 177,405 visits across the 7 EDs during the study period. The mean number of weekly ED visits in the prepandemic and pandemic periods was 4841 and 4029 weekly visits, respectively. In the interrupted time series analysis, there was no significant immediate effect of the pandemic start on opioid-related ED visits (−0.44 visits per 1000 ED visits, 95% CI −2.47 to 1.58, P = 0.66), however, there was a significant immediate effect of the pandemic start on alcohol-related ED visits (−4.1, 95% CI: −8.25 to −0.01, P < 0.05).

Background The clinical presentation of influenza in infancy may be similar to serious bacterial infection and be investigated with invasive procedures like lumbar puncture (LP), despite very limited evidence that influenza occurs concomitantly with bacterial meningitis, perhaps because the diagnosis of influenza is very often not established when the decision to perform LP is being considered. Methods A retrospective medical record review was undertaken in all children presenting to the Children’s Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia, in one winter season with laboratory‐confirmed influenza or other respiratory virus infections (ORVIs) but excluding respiratory syncytial virus, to compare the use of, and reflect on the need for, the performance of invasive diagnostic procedures, principally LP, but also blood culture, in influenza and non‐influenza cases. We also determined the rate of concomitant bacterial meningitis or bacteraemia. Findings Of 294 children, 51% had laboratory‐confirmed influenza and 49% had ORVIs such as parainfluenza viruses (34%) and adenoviruses (15%). Of those with influenza, 18% had a LP and 71% had a blood culture performed compared with 6·3% and 55·5% in the ORVI group (for both P < 0·01). In multivariate analysis, diagnosis of influenza was a strong independent predictor of both LP (P = 0·02) and blood culture (P = 0·05) being performed, and, in comparison with ORVIs, influenza cases were almost three times more likely to have a LP performed on presentation to hospital. One child with influenza (0·9%) had bacteraemia and none had meningitis. Interpretation Children with influenza were more likely to undergo LP on presentation to hospital compared with those presenting with ORVIs. If influenza is confirmed on admission by near‐patient testing, clinicians may be reassured and less inclined to perform LP, although if meningitis is clinically suspected, the clinician should act accordingly. We found that the risk of bacterial meningitis and bacteraemia was very low in hospitalised children with influenza and ORVIs. A systematic review should be performed to investigate this across a large number of settings.","Khandaker, Gulam; Heron, Leon; Rashid, Harunor; Li‐Kim‐Moy, Jean; Lester‐Smith, David; Kesson, Alison; McCaskill, Mary; Jones, Cheryl; Zurynski, Yvonne; Elliott, Elizabeth J.; Dwyer, Dominic E.; Booy, Robert",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,55,24

It reports observations on 522 patients with confirmed CoViD-19 symptomatology, compared to 40 control subjects. In brief, notable T cytopoenia was recorded by flow cytometry in the CD4+ and the CD8+ populations, which were significantly yet inversely correlated with remarkably increased serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a. Flow cytometry established a progressive increase in the expression of programmed cell death marker-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) as patients (n=14) deteriorated from prodromal to symptomatic CoViD-19 requiring intensive care. Here, we interpret these observations of Diao et al from our current understanding of T cell immunophysiology and immunopathology following an immune challenge in the form of sustained viral infection, as is the case in CoViD-19, with emphasis on exhausted T cells (Tex). Recent clinical trials to rescue Tex show promising outcomes. The relevance of these interventions for the prevention and treatment of CoViD-19 is discussed. Taken together, the data of Diao et al could proffer the first glimpse of immunopathology and possible immunotherapy for patients with CoViD-19.","Chiappelli, Francesco; Khakshooy, Allen; Greenberg, Gillian",Bioinformation,55,3

In this review, we describe the current knowledge about plant extracts containing polyphenols that inhibit Covid-19. Many plant-derived natural compounds (polyphenols) might provide a starting point for the research on the use of plant extracts in coronavirus treatment and prevention. Antivirus polyphenolic drugs can inhibit coronavirus enzymes, which are essential for virus replication and infection. This group of natural substances (betulinic acid, indigo, aloeemodine, luteolin, and quinomethyl triterpenoids, quercitin or gallates) is a potential key to designing antiviral therapies for inhibiting viral proteases. The known pharmacophore structures of bioactive substances can be useful in the elaboration of new anti-Covid-19 formulations.

In this paper, we examine how healthcare manufacturing firms cope with the operational disruptions and opportunities associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlight the central role of organizational resilience and examine whether servitization and digitalization can improve the organizational resilience of healthcare manufacturing firms. On the basis of the organizational information processing theory, we suggest that servitization and digitalization can improve the stability and flexibility of operations, which make healthcare manufacturing firms more resilient to the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypotheses were tested using survey data from 163 manufacturing firms located in China. The results indicate that both servitization and digitalization improve the organizational resilience of healthcare manufacturing firms, leading to higher firm growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, organizational resilience mediates the impacts of servitization and digitalization on firm growth. Environmental dynamism strengthens the relationship between digitalization and organizational resilience. This study offers new insights for healthcare manufacturing firms to prepare for crisis events and achieve sustainable development in a highly competitive environment.","Zhang, Jingsi; Qi, Liangqun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,55,12

Moreover isotope-coded affinity tag technology coupled with two-dimensional LC-MS/MS were also applied to the differential proteins of infected cells. By combining these two complementary strategies, 355 unique proteins were identified and quantitated with 186 of them differentially expressed (at least 1.5-fold quantitative alteration) between infected and uninfected Vero E6 cells. The implication for cellular responses to virus infection was analyzed in depth according to the proteomic results.

Moreover, Israel had administered almost 11.0 doses per 100 population, while the next highest rates were 3.5 (in Bahrain) and 1.4 (in the United Kingdom). All other countries had administered less than 1 dose per 100 population. While Israel’s rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations was not problem-free, its initial phase had clearly been rapid and effective. A large number of factors contributed to this early success, and they can be divided into three major groups. The first group of factors consists of long-standing characteristics of Israel which are extrinsic to health care. They include: Israel’s small size (in terms of both area and population), a relatively young population, relatively warm weather in December 2020, a centralized national system of government, and well-developed infrastructure for implementing prompt responses to large-scale national emergencies. The second group of factors are also long-standing, but they are health-system specific. They include: the organizational, IT and logistical capacities of Israel’s community-based health care providers, the availability of a cadre of well-trained, salaried, community-based nurses who are directly employed by those providers, a tradition of effective cooperation between government, health plans, hospitals, and emergency care providers – particularly during national emergencies; and support tools and decisionmaking frameworks to support vaccination campaigns. The third group consists of factors that are more recent and are specific to the COVID-19 vaccination effort. They include: the mobilization of special government funding for vaccine purchase and distribution, timely contracting for a large amount of vaccines relative to Israel’s population, the use of simple, clear and easily implementable criteria for determining who had priority for receiving vaccines in the early phases of the distribution process, a creative technical response that addressed the demanding cold storage requirements of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and well-tailored outreach efforts to encourage Israelis to sign up for vaccinations and then show up to get vaccinated. While many of these facilitating factors are not unique to Israel, part of what made the Israeli rollout successful was its combination of facilitating factors (as opposed to each factor being unique separately) and the synergies it created among them. Moreover, some high-income countries (including the US, the UK, and Canada) are lacking several of these facilitating factors, apparently contributing to the slower pace of the rollout in those countries.","Rosen, Bruce; Waitzberg, Ruth; Israeli, Avi",Isr J Health Policy Res,55,20

The impact of the pandemic in low and middle income countries has the potential to worsen already strained access to surgical care. Timely assessment of surgical volumes in these countries remains challenging. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether usage data from a globally used anesthesiology calculator mobile application can serve as a proxy for global surgical case volume and contribute to monitoring of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in World Bank low income countries where official data collection is not currently practical. DESIGN: Subset of data from an ongoing observational cohort study of users of the application collected from October 1, 2018 to April 18, 2020. SETTING: The mobile application is available from public sources; users download and use the application per their own clinical needs on personal mobile devices. PARTICIPANTS: No user data was excluded from the study. EXPOSURE(S): Events with impacts on surgical case volumes, including weekends, holidays, and the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): It was previously noted that application usage was decreased on weekends and during winter holidays. We subsequently hypothesized that more detailed analysis would reveal impacts of country-specific or region-specific holidays on the volume of app use. RESULTS: 4,300,975 data points from 92,878 unique users were analyzed. Physicians and other anesthesia providers comprised 85.8% of the study population. Application use was reduced on holidays and weekends and correlated with fluctuations in surgical volume. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with substantial reductions in app use globally and regionally. There was strong cross correlation between COVID-19 case count and reductions in app use. By country, there was a median global reduction in app use to 58% of baseline (interquartile range, 46%−75%). Application use in low-income continues to decline but in high-income countries has stabilized. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Application usage metadata provides a real-time indicator of surgical volume. This data may be used to identify impacted regions where disruptions to surgical care are disproportionate or prolonged. A dashboard for continuous visualization of these data has been deployed.","O’Reilly-Shah, Vikas N.; Van Cleve, Wil; Long, Dustin R.; Moll, Vanessa; Evans, Faye M.; Sunshine, Jacob E.; Kassebaum, Nicholas J.; Harrison, Ewen M; Jabaley, Craig S.",medRxiv,55,10

COVID-19 vaccine is a vital strategy to prevent this critical pandemic. However, unwillingness to take this vaccine are key barriers to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. The control of this pandemic will depend principally on the people acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was intended to determine the acceptance rate toward COVID-19 vaccine in Africa. Methods: African Journals OnLine, PubMed, Cochrane Review, HINARI, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus were used to retrieve related articles. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were used for this study. Random-effect model, a funnel plot, Egger’s test, I(2) statistic, subgroup analysis was done. The study was performed by using a STATA version 11 statistical software. Results: A total of 22 studies with 33,912 study participants were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. From this finding, the pooled prevalence of acceptance toward COVID-19 vaccine among adults in Africa was 48.93% (95% CI: [39.49, 58.37]). The subgroup analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among adults in Africa was highest (66.03%, 95% CI [62.84, 69.22]) in Southern Africa, and Lowest (24.28%, 95% CI [3.26, 45.30]) in Northern Africa. Conclusion: This study showed that the estimate of the pooled prevalence of acceptance toward COVID-19 vaccine among adults in Africa was very low. All concerned bodies should be actively involved to improve the acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccine.","Wake, Addisu Dabi",Glob Pediatr Health,55,20

Past studies in reinforcement learning and educational psychology have linked prediction error, a measure of surprise, to successful learning from feedback. However, there are substantial individual differences in belief-updating success, and the psychological factors that influence belief updating remain unclear. Here, we identify a novel factor that may predict belief updating: right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), which is characterized by a desire for order, structure, and preservation of social norms. We hypothesized that because people who score high on RWA are motivated to preserve entrenched beliefs, they may often fail to successfully update their beliefs when confronted with new information. Using a novel paradigm, we challenged participants’ false beliefs and misconceptions to elicit prediction error. In two studies, we found consistent evidence that high-RWA individuals were less successful at correcting their false beliefs. Relative to low-RWA individuals, high-RWA individuals were less likely to revise beliefs in response to prediction error. We argue that RWA is associated with a relatively closed-minded cognitive style that negatively influences belief updating.

Comprehensively evaluating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among HCWs in a large healthcare system could help identify the impact that epidemiological factors and presence of symptoms have on immune response to the infection over time. AIM: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies among healthcare workers (HCWs), to identify associated epidemiological factors and to study antibody kinetics. METHODS: We completed a longitudinal evaluation of the seroprevalence and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in approximately 30,000 HCWs in the largest healthcare system in the State of Connecticut. FINDINGS: The baseline prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody among 6,863 HCWs was 6.3% (95% CI: 5.7%-6.9%) and was highest among patient care support (16.7%), medical assistants (9.1%), and nurses (8.2%) and lower for physicians (3.8%) and advanced practice providers (4.5%). Seroprevalence was significantly higher among African Americans (OR 3.26 compared to Caucasians, 95% CI 1.77-5.99), in participants with at least one COVID symptom (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.92-4.68), and in those reporting prior quarantine (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.57-5.70). No symptoms were reported in 24% of the seropositive participants. Among the 47% who returned for a follow-up serology test, the seroreversion rate was 39.5% and the seroconversion rate was 2.2%. The incidence of reinfection in the seropositive group was zero. CONCLUSION: Although there is a decline in the IgG antibody signal over time, 60.5% of the seropositive HCWs maintain their seroconversion status after a median time of 5.5 months.","Papasavas, Pavlos; Olugbile, Sope; Wu, Ulysses; Robinson, Kenneth; Roberts, Amity L.; O’Sullivan, David M.; McLaughlin, Tara; Mather, Jeffrey F.; Steinberg, Adam C.; Orlando, Rocco; Kumar, Ajay",J Hosp Infect,55,6

When a defect occurs in the sanitary plumbing system that affects the system integrity, a cross transmission route is created that can enable the emission of bioaerosols from the system into the building. These emission occurrences are characterised as short burst events (typically < 1 minute in duration) which makes them difficult to detect and predict. The characterisation of these emission events is the focus of this research. Two methods were used to characterise bioaerosol emission events in a full scale test rig : (i) an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) for particle size distribution and concentrations; and (ii) a slit to agar sampler to enumerate the ingress of a viable tracer microorganism (Pseudomonas putida). The APS data confirmed that most particles (> 99.5%) were <5 m and were therefore considered aerosols. Particles generated within the sanitary plumbing system as a result of a toilet flush leads to emissions into the building during system defect conditions with an equivalence of someone talking loudly for over 6 and a half minutes. There were no particles detected of a size > 11 m anywhere in the system. Particle count was influenced by flush volume, but it was not possible to determine if there was any direct influence from airflow rate. Typical emissions resulting from a 6 litre flush were in the range of 200 to 400 particles per second at a concentration of typically 9 to 12 number per cm 3 and a total particle count in the region of 3,000 to 4,000 particles, whereas the peak emissions from a 1.2 litre flush was 60 to 80 particles per second at a concentration of 2.4 to 3 number per cm3 and a total particle count in the region of 886 to 1045 particles. The reduction in particles is in direct proportion to the reduction in flush volume. The slit to agar sampler was able to provide viable time course CFU data and confirmed the origin of the particles to be the tracer microorganism flushed into the system. The time course data also has characteristics consistent with the unsteady nature of a toilet flush.","Gormley, M.; Aspray, T. J.; Kelly, D. A.",,55,18

Upon influenza virus entry, host cells experience modifications of endomembranes, including those used for virus trafficking and replication. Here we report that influenza virus infection modifies mitochondrial morphodynamics by promoting mitochondria elongation and altering endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria tethering in host cells. Expression of the viral RNA recapitulates these modifications inside cells. Virus induced mitochondria hyper-elongation was promoted by fission associated protein DRP1 relocalization to the cytosol, enhancing a pro-fusion status. We show that altering mitochondrial hyper-fusion with Mito-C, a novel pro-fission compound, not only restores mitochondrial morphodynamics and endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites but also dramatically reduces influenza replication. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed Mito-C antiviral property is directly connected with the innate immunity signaling RIG-I complex at mitochondria.

Comparator (placebo): Plasma-Lyte 148 Solution for Infusion (200mls). The cellular product (REALIST ORBCEL-C) was developed and patented by Orbsen Therapeutics. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary safety outcome is the incidence of serious adverse events. The primary efficacy outcome is Oxygenation Index (OI) at day 7. Secondary outcomes include: OI at days 4 and 14; respiratory compliance, driving pressure and PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (PF ratio) at days 4, 7 and 14; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at days 4, 7 and 14; extubation and reintubation; ventilation free days at day 28; duration of mechanical ventilation; length of ICU and hospital stay; 28-day and 90-day mortality. RANDOMISATION: After obtaining informed consent, patients will be randomised via a centralised automated 24-hour telephone or web-based randomisation system (CHaRT, Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials, University of Aberdeen). Randomisation will be stratified by recruitment centre and by vasopressor use and patients will be allocated to REALIST ORBCEL-C or placebo control in a 1:1 ratio. BLINDING (MASKING): The investigator, treating physician, other members of the site research team and participants will be blinded. The cell therapy facility and clinical trials pharmacist will be unblinded to facilitate intervention and placebo preparation. The unblinded individuals will keep the treatment information confidential. The infusion bag will be masked at the time of preparation and will be administered via a masked infusion set. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A sample size of 60 patients with 30 patients randomised to the intervention and 30 to the control group. If possible, recruitment will continue beyond 60 patients to provide more accurate and definitive trial results. The total number of patients recruited will depend on the pandemic and be guided by the data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC). TRIAL STATUS: REALIST Phase 1 completed in January 2020 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was an open label dose escalation study of REALIST ORBCEL-C in patients with ARDS. The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as REALIST Phase 2 was planned to commence and the investigator team decided to repurpose the Phase 2 trial as a COVID-19 specific trial. This decision was discussed and approved by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and DMEC.

We assessed quality aspects of rapid expansion of a virtual urgent care (VUC) telehealth system and the effects of a secondary telephonic screening initiative during the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis in a single hospital network of VUC patients from March 1, 2020 through April 20, 2020. We abstracted demographic data, comorbidities, VUC return visits, emergency department (ED) referrals, and ED visits, dispositions, intubations, and deaths. We also reviewed incomplete visits. For comparison, we evaluated outcomes of non-admission dispositions from the ED: return visits with and without admission and deaths. We separately analyzed the effects of enhanced callback system targeting higher risk patients with COVID-like illness during the last two weeks of the study period. RESULTS: A total of 18,278 unique adult patients completed 22,413 VUC visits. Separately, 718 patient-scheduled visits were incomplete; the majority were no-shows. 50.9% of all patients and 74.0% of patients aged 60 years or older had comorbidities. Of VUC visits, 6.8% had a subsequent VUC encounter within 72 hours; 1.8% had a subsequent ED visit. Of patients with enhanced follow-up, 4.3% were referred for ED evaluation. Mortality was 0.20% overall; 0.21% initially and 0.16% with enhanced follow-up (p = 0.59). Males and black patients were significantly overrepresented in decedents. CONCLUSION: Appropriately deployed VUC services can provide a pragmatic strategy to care for large numbers of patients. Ongoing surveillance of operational, technical, and clinical factors is critical for patient quality and safety with this modality.","Smith, Silas W.; Tiu, Janelle; Caspers, Christopher G.; Lakdawala, Viraj S.; Koziatek, Christian A.; Swartz, Jordan L.; Lee, David C.; Jamin, Catherine T.; Femia, Robert J.; Haines, Elizabeth J.",Jt Comm J Qual Patient Saf,55,26

Evidence from Africa indicates that significantly less COVID-19 patients suffer from serious symptoms than in the industrialized world. We and others previously postulated a partial explanation for this phenomenon, being a different, more activated immune system due to parasite infections. Here, we aimed to test this hypothesis by investigating a potential correlation of co-infection with parasites with COVID-19 severity in an endemic area in Africa. Methods: Ethiopian COVID-19 patients were enrolled and screened for intestinal parasites, between July 2020 and March 2021. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe COVID-19. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between parasite infection, and COVID-19 severity. Models were adjusted for sex, age, residence, education level, occupation, body mass index, and comorbidities. Findings: 751 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were enrolled, of whom 284 (37.8%) had intestinal parasitic infection. Only 27/255 (10.6%) severe COVID-19 patients were co-infected with intestinal parasites, while 257/496 (51.8%) non-severe COVID-19 patients were parasite positive (p<0.0001). Patients co-infected with parasites had lower odds of developing severe COVID-19, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.23 (95% CI 0.17–0.30; p<0.0001) for all parasites, aOR 0.37 ([95% CI 0.26–0.51]; p<0.0001) for protozoa, and aOR 0.26 ([95% CI 0.19–0.35]; p<0.0001) for helminths. When stratified by species, co-infection with Entamoeba spp., Hymenolepis nana, Schistosoma mansoni, and Trichuris trichiura implied lower probability of developing severe COVID-19. There were 11 deaths (1.5%), and all were among patients without parasites (p = 0.009). Interpretation: Parasite co-infection is associated with a reduced risk of severe COVID-19 in African patients. Parasite-driven immunomodulatory responses may mute hyper-inflammation associated with severe COVID-19.

There is an unmet need for new medical treatment options for endometriosis. Pelvic peritoneal mesothelial cells of women with endometriosis exhibit detrimental metabolic reprogramming that creates an environment favouring the formation and survival of endometriosis lesions. We have generated powerful preclinical proof-of-concept data to show that it is possible to correct this metabolic phenotype using dichloroacetate (DCA), a non-hormonal compound previously used to treat rare metabolic disorders in children. We plan a single-arm, open-label, single site exploratory clinical trial to inform the design of a future randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine the efficacy of DCA for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain. METHODS: We will recruit 30 women with endometriosis-associated pain over a 6-month period. All participants will receive approximately 6.25 mg/kg oral DCA capsules twice daily for 6 weeks, with a dose increase to approximately 12.5 mg/kg twice daily for a further 6 weeks if their pain has not been adequately controlled on this dose regime and side-effects are acceptable. If pain is adequately controlled with minimal side-effects, the lower dose will be continued for a further 6 weeks. The primary objective is to determine whether it is possible to achieve acceptable recruitment and retention rates within the defined exclusion and inclusion criteria. Secondary objectives are to determine the acceptability of the trial to participants, including the proposed methods of recruitment, treatment, follow-up frequency and number of questionnaires. The recruitment rate will be determined by the proportion of patients recruited from the pool of eligible women. The retention rate will be determined by the proportion of participants who attended the final trial visit. DISCUSSION: This is a feasibility study to explore effectiveness and acceptability of the proposed field methodology (recruitment, retention, study processes and compliance with treatment). The results will be used to inform the design of a future RCT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04046081 Registered 6 August 2019","Leow, H. W.; Koscielniak, M.; Williams, L.; Saunders, P.

The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of risk stratifying patients for COVID-19 testing and to identify which risk factors and which other clinical variables were associated with SARS-CoV-2 PCR test positivity. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study on a sample of symptomatic patients evaluated at an immediate care setting. A risk assessment questionnaire was administered to every patient before clinician evaluation. High-risk patients received SARS-CoV-2 test and low-risk patients were evaluated by a clinician and selectively tested based on clinician judgment. Multivariate analyses tested whether risk factors and additional variables were associated with test positivity. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio of testing positive was associated with COVID-19-positive or suspect close contact (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.15-2.10), large gathering attendance with a COVID-19-positive individual (aOR 1.92, 95% CI 1.10-3.34), and, with the largest effect size, decreased taste/smell (aOR 2.83, 95% CI 2.01-3.99). Testing positive was associated with ages 45-64 and ≥65 (aOR 1.75, 95% CI 1.25-2.44, and aOR 2.78, 95% CI 1.49-5.16), systolic blood pressures ≤120 (aOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.20-2.24), and, with the largest effect size, temperatures ≥99.0°F (aOR 3.06, 95% CI 2.23-4.20). The rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 test was similar between high-risk and low risk patients (225 [22.2%] vs 50 [19.8%]; P = .41). DISCUSSION: The risk assessment questionnaire was not effective at stratifying patients for testing. Although individual risk factors were associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity, the low-risk group had similar positivity rates to the high-risk group. Our observations underscore the need for clinicians to develop clinical experience and share best practices and for systems and payors to support policies, funding, and resources to test all symptomatic patients.","Oshman, Lauren; Caplan, Amanda; Ali, Raabiah; Singh, Lavisha; Khalid, Rabeeya; Jameel, Mohammed; David, Sean P.",J Prim Care Community Health,55,16

The clinical outcomes of biological offspring of depressed (high-risk) and not depressed (low-risk) parents who have been directly interviewed over the years are presented. METHODS: a longitudinal retrospective cohort study began in 1982, and 276 biological offspring of moderately-to-severely depressed or non-depressed parents from the same community were followed up to 38 years. Rates of psychiatric disorders for offspring were collected by clinically trained interviewers. Final diagnoses were made by M.D. or Ph.D. clinicians. Mortality and cause of death were obtained from relatives and registries. FINDINGS: high- compared to low-risk offspring continue to have about a three-fold increased risk of MDD, increased rates of anxiety disorder, substance dependence, and poorer functioning over the life course. Adolescence and early adulthood remain prime age of first onsets. Within high-risk group only, the death rate due to unnatural causes, suicides and overdose was 4·97/100 in the offspring and 5·36/100 in their parents. This subsample of White, lower-educated, often unemployed persons, who died by unnatural causes are similar demographically to those described as having a recent increase in ‘deaths of despair’. INTERPRETATION: family history of MDD continues to be a powerful predictor of clinical course and mortality and should be probed in clinical visits, especially in youth when depression usually first appears.","Weissman, Myrna M.; Talati, Ardesheer; Gameroff, Marc J.; Pan, Lifang; Skipper, Jamie; Posner, Jonathan E.; Wickramaratne, Priya J.",EClinicalMedicine,55,1

The factors that contribute to the limited adoption of DHT, particularly in cardiovascular settings, are unclear. The objective of this review was to determine the barriers and facilitators of DHT uptake from the perspective of patients, clinicians, and researchers. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases for studies published from inception to May 2020 that reported barriers and/or facilitators of DHT adoption in cardiovascular care. We extracted data on study design, setting, cardiovascular condition, and type of DHT. We conducted a thematic analysis to identify barriers and facilitators of DHT uptake. The search identified 3075 unique studies, of which 29 studies met eligibility criteria. Studies employed: qualitative methods (n = 13), which included interviews and focus groups; quantitative methods (n = 5), which included surveys; or a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods (n = 11). Twenty-five studies reported patient-level barriers, most common of which were difficult-to-use technology (n=7) and a poor internet connection (n=7). Six studies reported clinician-level barriers, which included increased workload (n=4) and a lack of integration with electronic medical records (n=3).Twenty-four studies reported patient-level facilitators, which included improved communication with clinicians (n=10) and personalized technology (n=6). Four studies reported clinician-level facilitators, which included approval and organizational support from cardiology departments and/or hospitals (n=3) and technologies that improved efficiency (n=3). No studies reported researcher-level barriers or facilitators. In summary, internet access, user-friendliness, organizational support, workflow efficiency, and data integration were reported as important factors in the uptake of DHT by patients and clinicians. These factors can be considered when selecting and implementing DHTs in cardiovascular clinical settings.","Whitelaw, Sera; Pellegrini, Danielle M; Mamas, Mamas A; Cowie, Martin; Van Spall, Harriette G C",Eur Heart J Digit Health,55,1

This paper discusses the methodology of estimating the detection and diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19 tests. It explains the clear distinction between the technical characteristics of the tests, the detection measures, and the diagnostic measures that have clinical and public health implications. It demonstrates the importance of the prevalence of COVID-19 in terms of determining the ability of a test to yield a diagnosis. We explain the methodology of evaluating diagnostic tests, using the predictive summary index (PSI), and the minimum number of tests that need to be performed in order to correctly diagnose one person, which is estimated by 1/PSI. In a population with low prevalence, even a high-sensitivity test may lead to a high percentage of false positive diagnoses, resulting in the need for multiple high-cost tests to achieve a correct diagnosis. Thus, basing a policy for opening airports on diagnostic testing, even with the best test for COVID-19, has some limits.","Linn, Shai; Tzafrir, Shay; Gueron, Shay",Rambam Maimonides Med J,55,16

Epidemiological evidence indicates the impact of RSV in older adults may be similar to nonpandemic influenza, both in the community and in long-term care facilities. Attack rates in nursing homes are approximately 5–10% per year with significant rates of pneumonia (10–20%) and death (2–5%). Estimates using US healthcare databases and viral surveillance results over a 9-year period indicate that RSV infection causes approximately 10 000 all-cause deaths annually among persons >64 years of age. In contrast, influenza A accounted for approximately 37 000 yearly deaths in the same age group. The clinical features of RSV infection may be difficult to distinguish from those of influenza but include nasal congestion, cough, wheezing and low-grade fever. Older persons with underlying heart and lung disease and immunocompromised patients are at highest risk for RSV infection-related pneumonia and death. Diagnosis of RSV infection in adults is difficult because viral culture and antigen detection are insensitive, presumably because of low viral titres. The combination of serology and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay offers the best sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of RSV but unfortunately these techniques are not widely available; consequently, most adult RSV disease goes unrecognised. Although treatment of RSV infection in the elderly is largely supportive, early therapy with ribavirin and intravenous γ-globulin improves survival in immunocompromised persons. An effective RSV vaccine has not yet been developed. Therefore, prevention of RSV is limited to standard infection control practices, such as hand washing and the use of gowns and gloves.","Falsey, Ann R.; Walsh, Edward E.",Drugs Aging,55,16

Effective respiratory hygiene in the ED is imperative to limit the spread of dangerous respiratory pathogens, including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and bioterrorism agents, particularly given that these agents may not be immediately identifiable. Sustaining effective respiratory control measures is especially challenging in the ED because of patient crowding, inadequate staffing and resources, and ever-increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients. Threat of contagion exists not only for ED patients but also for visitors, health care workers, and inpatient populations. Potential physical sites for respiratory disease transmission extend from out-of-hospital care, to triage, waiting room, ED treatment area, and the hospital at large. This article presents a summary of the most current information available in the literature about respiratory hygiene in the ED, including administrative, patient, and legal issues. Wherever possible, specific recommendations and references to practical information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are provided. The “Administrative Issues” section describes coordination with public health departments, procedures for effective facility planning, and measures for health care worker protection (education, staffing optimization, and vaccination). The patient care section addresses the potentially infected ED patient, including emergency medical services concerns, triage planning, and patient transport. “Legal Issues” discusses the interplay between public safety and patient privacy. Emergency physicians play a critical role in early identification, treatment, and containment of potentially lethal respiratory pathogens.
