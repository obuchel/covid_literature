1311,1311,1311,Short Message Service (SMS) Applications for Disease Prevention in Developing Countries,22.57373,5.640388,2012-01-12,"BACKGROUND: The last decade has witnessed unprecedented growth in the number of mobile phones in the developing world, thus linking millions of previously unconnected people. The ubiquity of mobile phones, which allow for short message service (SMS), provides new and innovative opportunities for disease prevention efforts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of SMS interventions for disease prevention in developing countries and provide recommendations for future work. METHODS: A systematic search of peer-reviewed and gray literature was performed for papers published in English, French, and German before May 2011 that describe SMS applications for disease prevention in developing countries. RESULTS: A total of 34 SMS applications were described, among which 5 had findings of an evaluation reported. The majority of SMS applications were pilot projects in various levels of sophistication; nearly all came from gray literature sources. Many applications were initiated by the project with modes of intervention varying between one-way or two-way communication, with or without incentives, and with educative games. Evaluated interventions were well accepted by the beneficiaries. The primary barriers identified were language, timing of messages, mobile network fluctuations, lack of financial incentives, data privacy, and mobile phone turnover. CONCLUSION: This review illustrates that while many SMS applications for disease prevention exist, few have been evaluated. The dearth of peer-reviewed studies and the limited evidence found in this systematic review highlight the need for high-quality efficacy studies examining behavioral, social, and economic outcomes of SMS applications and mobile phone interventions aimed to promote health in developing country contexts.","Déglise, Carole; Suggs, L.

1620,1620,1620,An Internet-Based Epidemiological Investigation of the Outbreak of H7N9 Avian Influenza A in China Since Early 2013,22.281906,5.7570443,2014-09-25,"BACKGROUND: In early 2013, a new type of avian influenza, H7N9, emerged in China. It quickly became an issue of great public concern and a widely discussed topic on the Internet. A considerable volume of relevant information was made publicly available on the Internet through various sources. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the outbreak of H7N9 in China based on data openly available on the Internet and to validate our investigation by comparing our findings with a well-conducted conventional field epidemiologic study. METHODS: We searched publicly accessible Internet data on the H7N9 outbreak primarily from government and major mass media websites in China up to February 10, 2014. Two researchers independently extracted, compared, and confirmed the information of each confirmed H7N9 case using a self-designed data extraction form. We summarized the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of confirmed H7N9 cases and compared them with those from the field study. RESULTS: According to our data updated until February 10, 2014, 334 confirmed H7N9 cases were identified. The median age was 58 years and 67.0% (219/327) were males. Cases were reported in 15 regions in China. Five family clusters were found. Of the 16.8% (56/334) of the cases with relevant data, 69.6% (39/56) reported a history of exposure to animals. Of the 1751 persons with a close contact with a confirmed case, 0.6% (11/1751) of them developed respiratory symptoms during the 7-day surveillance period. In the 97.9% (327/334) of the cases with relevant data, 21.7% (71/327) died, 20.8% (68/327) were discharged from a hospital, and 57.5% (188/327) were of uncertain status. We compared our findings before February 10, 2014 and those before December 1, 2013 with those from the conventional field study, which had the latter cutoff date of ours in data collection. Our study showed most epidemiological and clinical characteristics were similar to those in the field study, except for case fatality (71/327, 21.7% for our data before February 10; 45/138, 32.6% for our data before December 1; 47/139, 33.8% for the field study), time from illness onset to first medical care (4 days, 3 days, and 1 day), and time from illness onset to death (16.5 days, 17 days, and 21 days). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from our Internet-based investigation were similar to those from the conventional field study in most epidemiological and clinical aspects of the outbreak. Importantly, publicly available Internet data are open to any interested researchers and can thus greatly facilitate the investigation and control of such outbreaks. With improved efforts for Internet data provision, Internet-based investigation has a great potential to become a quick, economical, novel approach to investigating sudden issues of great public concern that involve a relatively small number of cases like this H7N9 outbreak.","Mao, Chen; Wu, Xin-Yin; Fu, Xiao-Hong; Di, Meng-Yang; Yu, Yuan-Yuan; Yuan, Jin-Qiu; Yang, Zu-Yao; Tang, Jin-Ling",J Med Internet Res,286,22
3029,3029,3029,Politics of Ebola and the critical role of global health diplomacy for the CARICOM,22.310635,5.8521004,2017,"The 2014 Ebola epidemic was the largest in history, affecting Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Mali in West Africa. The International Health Regulations are legally binding in 194 countries including all the member states of WHO “to prevent, protect against, control, and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease.” Since the Caribbean Community region heavily depends on tourism, a single case of the disease anywhere in the region could have serious negative consequences for the rest of the region's tourism industry. Global health diplomacy brings together the disciplines of public health, international affairs, management, law, and economics and focuses on negotiations that shape and manage the global policy environment for health. The regional institutes such as Caribbean Public Health Agency should play a more proactive and pivotal role in the creation of regional response teams in all the island nations collaborating with the departments of public health and epidemiology at the regional campuses of The University of the West Indies. The role of global health diplomacy and its practice should be encouraged to reach a consensus among the stakeholders considering the threat to the health security in the region. There is a need for the cadre of global health diplomats who has a critical understanding of health and also the practice of diplomacy since such serious health issues have implications at the global level in this globalized world.","Chattu, Vijay Kumar",J Family Med Prim Care,286,5

Four vectors, DNA, SFV, human serotype 5 adenovirus (HuAd5) and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) poxvirus, all expressing hepatitis C virus Core, E1, E2 and NS3, were combined in three prime-boost regimen, and their ability to elicit immune responses against HCV antigens in rhesus macaques was explored and compared. All combinations induced specific T-cell immune responses, including high IFN-γ production. The group immunized with the SFV+MVA regimen elicited higher E2-specific responses as compared with the two other modalities, while animals receiving HuAd5 injections elicited lower IL-4 responses as compared with those receiving MVA. The IFN-γ responses to NS3 were remarkably similar between groups. Only the adenovirus induced envelope-specific antibody responses, but these failed to show neutralizing activity. Therefore, the two novel regimens failed to induce superior responses as compared with already existing HCV vaccine candidates. Differences were found in response to envelope proteins, but the relevance of these remain uncertain given the surprisingly poor correlation with immunogenicity data in chimpanzees, underlining the difficulty to predict efficacy from immunology studies.

First, the paper provides a high-level, general review of the current efforts to provide healthcare services in underserved areas and the many efforts being made to impact health outcomes by various international, governmental, and NGO entities. We also very briefly review university programs and research institutions that have specific technical and institutional assets with significant potential to carry out research or to partially implement such a plan. Our review uses weighted values in a decision-system that takes in a variety of assets we consider fundamental to successful engagement in delivery of new, innovative, technology-enabled healthcare systems for under-resourced settings. We then review nine factors that hinder the advancement in healthcare in under-resourced settings, some of which are well described in current literature and some that may bring new perspectives. The paper then attempts to review how a proposed system can manage to operate successfully within the context of the nine named hindrance factors. The primary focus of the paper is in the description of a system which can increase the availability of diagnostics through technology-enabled systems. Such a system would impact the outcomes of persons in underserved regions. The paper then describes why making diagnostics available is a critical priority among efforts for improvements in global health.","Melander, David; Sivarasu, Sudesh; Yekinni, Ibrahim; Yunzhang, Cheng; Erdman, Arthur",J Med Device,286,22

This article measures the relative values for the vaccination hesitancy indicators of confidence, complacency and convenience by risk-groups in urban areas of five countries of South America with contrasting vaccination rates, analyzing their association with sociodemographic variables and self-reported immunization status. METHODS: An exit survey was applied to 640 individuals per country in Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, distributed equally across risk groups of older adults, adults with risk factors, children ≤6 and pregnant women. Indicators were constructed for vaccine confidence, complacency and convenience. Analysis of variance and multiple logistic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Adults with risk factors are somewhat more confident of the influenza vaccine yet also more complacent. Convenience is higher for mothers of minors. Children and older adults report higher levels of vaccination. The 3Cs are more different across countries than across risk groups, with values for Chile higher for confidence and those for Uruguay the lowest. Complacency is lower in Brazil and higher in Uruguay. Results suggest that confidence and complacency affect vaccination rates across risk groups and countries. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccine confidence, complacency and convenience have to be bolstered to improve effective coverage across all risk groups in the urban areas of the countries studied. The role played by country contextual and national vaccination programs has to be further researched in relation to effective coverage of influenza vaccine.","González-Block, Miguel Ángel; Gutiérrez-Calderón, Emilio; Pelcastre-Villafuerte, Blanca Estela; Arroyo-Laguna, Juan; Comes, Yamila; Crocco, Pedro; Fachel-Leal, Andréa; Noboa, Laura; Riva-Knauth, Daniela; Rodríguez-Zea, Berenice; Ruoti, Mónica; Sarti, Elsa; Puentes-Rosas, Esteban",PLoS One,286,13

Although IPF is the most common form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, the precise mechanisms underlying this condition remain unknown. In this study, we used total saponins of Panax notoginseng inhalation solution (TIS) to induce idiopathic bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. The uniformity of delivery dose was investigated by analyzing the aerodynamic particle size distribution and drug stability. The potential of hydrogen potential of hydrogen (pH) of the inhalation solution was 7.0 and the solvent 0.9% NaCl solution, thus meeting physiological requirements for pulmonary drug administration. The delivery rate was 1.94 ± 0.16 mg·min(−1) and the total dose was 17.40 ± 0.04 mg. TIS was composed of five key components: notoginsenoside R(1), ginsenosides Rg(1), ginsenosides Re, ginsenosides Rb(1), and ginsenosides Rd. The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) for these five components were 3.62 ± 0.05 µm, 3.62 ± 0.06 µm, 3.65 ± 0.10 µm, 3.62 ± 0.06 µm, and 3.61 ± 0.05 µm, respectively. Fine particle fraction (FPF) was 66.24 ± 0.73%, 66.20 ± 0.89%, 66.07 ± 1.42%, 66.18 ± 0.79%, and 66.29 ± 0.70%, respectively. The MMAD for inhalation solutions needs to be 1–5 µm, which indicates that the components of TIS are suitable for inhalation. It is important to control the particle size of targeted drugs to ensure that the drug is delivered to the appropriate target tissue. In vitro experiments indicated that TIS exhibited high rates of deposition in lung tissue, thus indicating that pulmonary delivery systems may represent a good therapeutic option for patients.","Liu, Mengjiao; Zhang, Tianyi; Zang, Chen; Cui, Xiaolan; Li, Jianliang; Wang, Guohua",,286,1

Neuroimaging studies have shown neural evidence for either exemplar representations or prototype representations, but not both. Presently, we asked whether it is possible for multiple types of category representations to exist within a single task. We designed a categorization task to promote both exemplar and prototype representations and tracked their formation across learning. We found only prototype correlates during the final test. However, interim tests interspersed throughout learning showed prototype and exemplar representations across distinct brain regions that aligned with previous studies: prototypes in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior hippocampus and exemplars in inferior frontal gyrus and lateral parietal cortex. These findings indicate that, under the right circumstances, individuals may form representations at multiple levels of specificity, potentially facilitating a broad range of future decisions.","Bowman, Caitlin R; Iwashita, Takako; Zeithamova, Dagmar",,286,1

Reduction of body weight has been documented to reduce the risk of AF. Little is known about the effect of different weight-reducing interventions including bariatric surgery in obese individuals on the risk of arrhythmia recurrence following catheter ablation (CA) for AF, and about the pathophysiological mechanisms linking these two conditions. METHODS: The Effect of complex weigHt-reducing interventiOns on rhythm control in oBese subjects wITh Atrial Fibrillation (HOBIT-AF) is a single-blinded, parallel-group randomised controlled trial with 18-month follow-up to assess the effect of complex weight-reducing interventions supported by the use of smart technologies and bariatric surgery on the arrhythmia burden in obese individuals following CA for AF. One hundred and sixty individuals (age 18–70 years, body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) will be randomised in a 1:1 fashion to undergo a structured weight reduction programme and sleeve gastrectomy (when indicated and preferred by the patient) aiming to achieve greater than 10% weight reduction from baseline (intervention group) or standard post-ablation medical care (control group). Two-week continuous ECG monitoring will be used 3 and 18 months after CA to assess the arrhythmia burden. Other investigations will include transthoracic echocardiography with quantification of epicardial adipose tissue, and markers of low-grade inflammation and circulating adipokines. PLANNED OUTCOMES: The main objective is to assess the effect of complex weight-reducing interventions on the arrhythmia burden and quality of life. Subgroup analyses to identify patient subgroups preferentially benefiting from weight loss related to a decrease in arrhythmia burden will be performed. Exploratory objectives will include investigation of potential mechanisms linking weight reduction with amelioration of arrhythmia burden such as changes in markers of low-grade inflammation, circulating adipokines, cytokines, monocytes or reduction of epicardial adipose tissue volume.

This study aims to confirm the construct validity of a previously initially developed questionnaire and describe nurses’ perceptions about the relevance of their knowledge referred to cancer symptoms management, the UCV, the inequalities in access to healthcare, and malpractice risk. METHOD: A cross-sectional pan-national study was conducted using a convenience sample, collecting data through a previously initially validated questionnaire. Construct validity was corroborated through confirmatory factor analysis, and descriptive statistics were employed for summarizing the questionnaire’s scores. The scores between the nurses working in accredited cancer centers and nurses employed in general hospitals were inferentially compared. RESULTS: The sample comprised 810 nurses, 480 were nurses working in accredited cancer centers, and 330 were nurses working in general hospitals. The questionnaire showed adequate construct validity and reliability. Nurses perceived the cluster of psychosocial symptoms with a greater risk of UCV and inequalities in access to cancer services than the cluster of physical symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate HIV information acquisition and use among YBMSM who use the internet. METHODS: A web-based self-administered survey and semistructured interviews were conducted. The survey findings informed the development of the interview guide. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the survey sample, and interview data were analyzed thematically using modified grounded theory methodologies. RESULTS: Among the internet sample (N=83), the average age was 29.2 (SD 3.5) years, 41% (n=34) of participants self-reported living with HIV, 43% (n=36) were HIV-negative, and 15% (n=13) were unsure of their HIV status. Most participants (n=79, 95%) acquired HIV information through the internet while using a mobile phone. Web-based HIV information was intentionally sought from consumer health information websites (n=31, 37%), government health information websites (n=25, 30%), and social media (n=14, 17%). Most men incidentally acquired HIV information via advertisements on social media sites and geospatial dating apps (n=54, 65%), posts on social media sites from their web-based social ties (n=44, 53%), and advertisements while browsing the internet (n=40, 48%). Although the internet is the top source of HIV information, health care providers were the most preferred (n=42, 50%) and trusted (n=80, 96%) source of HIV information. HIV information was used to facilitate the use of HIV prevention and care services. The qualitative sample included YBMSM across a range of ages and at different points of engagement in HIV prevention and care. Qualitative findings included the importance of the internet as a primary source of HIV information. The internet was used because of its ease of accessibility, because of its ability to maintain anonymity while searching for sensitive information, and to mitigate intersecting stigmas in health care settings. Participants used HIV information to assess their risk for HIV and AIDS, support their skill building for HIV prevention, inform patient–doctor communication, and learn about HIV prevention and treatment options. Men expressed concerns about their diminishing access to online spaces for HIV information exchange among YBMSM because of censorship policies on social media sites and the stigmatizing framing and tone of mass media HIV-prevention advertisements encountered while using the internet. CONCLUSIONS: YBMSM in this sample had high utilization of eHealth for HIV information acquisition and use but diminished access to their preferred and most trusted source of HIV information: health care providers. Future eHealth-based HIV interventions culturally tailored for YBMSM should aim to reduce intersectional stigma at the point of care and support patient–provider communication. The findings demonstrate the need for community-informed, culturally tailored HIV messaging and online spaces for informational support exchange among YBMSM.","Threats, Megan; Bond, Keosha",J Med Internet Res,286,12

Because equids have a direct relationship with various vectors, they are possibly more frequently exposed to zoonotic agents than are humans. The undeniable importance of diseases such as human granulocytic anaplasmosis, spotted fever, and leishmaniasis for both public and animal health, as well as the possibility of equids acting as sources, reservoirs, or even sentinels for these pathogens, justifies the detection of their frequency and factors associated with infection in equids from northeastern Brazil. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 569 equids (528 horses, 33 donkeys, and 8 mules), 516 from a rural area and 53 from an urban area. Pathogen detection was carried out as follows: Borrelia spp. and Rickettsia spp., serological analysis; Leishmania spp., serological analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Anaplasma phagocytophilum, PCR. Determination of associated factors was carried out through generalized linear models. RESULTS: The frequencies of positivity for the pathogens observed in equids were as follows: Borrelia spp., 13.9% (79/569); Leishmania spp., 3.5% (20/569); Rickettsia spp. 33.4% (190/569). Regarding factors associated with infection, male sex was associated with protection against Borrelia spp.; donkeys and mules were associated with protection against Rickettsia spp., while a younger age was a risk factor. The infection of A. phagocytophilum was not detected in the sampled population. Co-infection was detected in 5.1% (29/569) of the animals. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the studied pathogenic agents are present in the prospected area, indicating a possible risk for both human and animal health. This demonstrates that equids can be considered important sentinels in the assessment of pathogens with zoonotic potential in the region.

Bacteriocin-producers Lpb. plantarum are also promising natural food preservatives. This study aimed to characterize Lpb. plantarum R23 and its bacteriocins (R23 bacteriocins). The genome sequence of Lpb. plantarum R23 was obtained by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in an Illumina NovaSeq platform. The activity of Lpb. plantarum R23-produced bacteriocin against two Listeria monocytogenes strains (L7946 and L7947) was evaluated, and its molecular size was determined by tricine-SDS-PAGE. No virulence or antibiotic resistance genes were detected. Four 100% identical proteins to the class II bacteriocins (Plantaricin E, Plantaricin F, Pediocin PA-1 (Pediocin AcH), and Coagulin A) were found by WGS analysis. The small (<6.5 kDa) R23 bacteriocins were stable at different pH values (ranging from 2 to 8), temperatures (between 4 and 100 °C), detergents (all, except Triton X-100 and Triton X-114 at 0.01 g/mL), and enzymes (catalase and α-amylase), did not adsorb to the producer cells, had a bacteriostatic mode of action and their maximum activity (AU/mL = 12,800) against two L. monocytogenes strains occurred between 15 and 21 h of Lpb. plantarum R23 growth. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum R23 showed to be a promising bio-preservative culture because, besides being safe, it produces a stable bacteriocin or bacteriocins (harbors genes encoding for the production of four) inhibiting pathogens as L. monocytogenes. Further studies in different food matrices are required to confirm this hypothesis and its suitability as a future starter culture.","Barbosa, Joana; Albano, Helena; Silva, Beatriz; Almeida, Maria Helena; Nogueira, Teresa; Teixeira, Paula",Int J Environ Res Public Health,286,22

Empirical antibiotic treatment without microbial identification hinders the selective use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics and effective patient treatment. Thus, the development of rapid and accurate diagnostic procedures that can be readily adopted by the clinic is necessary to minimize non-essential or excessive use of antibiotics and accelerate patient recovery from LRTI-induced damage. We developed and validated a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) assay with good analytical performance and high specificity to simultaneously detect four bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The analytical performance of mRT-PCR against target pathogens was evaluated by the limit of detection (LOD), specificity, and repeatability. Two hundred and ten clinical specimens from pneumonia patients were processed using an automatic nucleic acid extraction system for the “respiratory bacteria four” (RB4) mRT-PCR assay, and the results were directly compared to references from bacterial culture and/or Sanger sequencing. The RB4 mRT-PCR assay detected all target pathogens from sputum specimens with a coefficient of variation ranging from 0.29 to 1.71 and conservative LOD of DNA corresponding to 5 × 10(2) copies/reaction. The concordance of the assay with reference-positive specimens was 100%, and additional bacterial infections were detected from reference-negative specimens. Overall, the RB4 mRT-PCR assay showed a more rapid turnaround time and higher performance that those of reference assays.

Various bioactive compounds have been previously isolated from the leaves, fruit, and bark, which have different pharmacological properties, but the anticancer mechanisms of this plant are not known. In the current study we focused on understanding the probable mechanisms underlying the anticancer activity of F. carica plant extracts by molecular docking and dynamic simulation approaches. We evaluated the drug-likeness of the active constituents of the plant and explored its binding affinity with selected anticancer drug target receptors such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK-2), cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK-6), topoisomerase-I (Topo I), topoisomerase-II (Topo II), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). In silico toxicity studies revealed that thirteen molecules out of sixty-eight major active compounds in the plant extract have acceptable drug-like properties. Compound 37 (β-bourbonene) has a good binding affinity with the majority of drug targets, as revealed by molecular docking studies. The complexes of the lead molecules with the drug receptors were stable in terms of molecular dynamics simulation derived parameters such as root mean square deviation and radius of gyration. The top ten residues contributing significantly to the binding free energies were deciphered through analysis of molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA). Thus, the results of our studies unravel the potential of F. carica bioactive compounds as anticancer candidate molecules against selected macromolecular receptors.","Gurung, Arun Bahadur; Ali, Mohammad Ajmal; Lee, Joongku; Farah, Mohammad Abul; Al-Anazi, Khalid Mashay",PLoS One,286,22

In total, 28,574 nonsmokers aged >19 years were selected from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (2009–2018). First, changes in the annual concentration of UCo were analyzed, and the annual SHS exposure rates were measured based on SR and UCo from 2009 to 2018. Then, the average UCo concentration and UCo-measured SHS exposure rate were confirmed according to the subjects’ characteristics. Finally, factors associated with the UCo-measured SHS exposure rate were identified based on multiple regression analysis. The findings showed that the annual UCo concentrations and self-reported SHS exposure rates dropped significantly over the past decade. In contrast, the UCo-measured SHS exposure rate indicated that >80% of nonsmokers are still exposed to SHS. Moreover, we found vulnerable groups using UCo-measured SHS exposure rate. In particular, the self-reported SHS exposure at home and in workplaces and house type was highly associated with SHS exposure. Thus, these findings indicate that the actual SHS exposure could not be properly assessed by SR and should be verified using a biomarker, such as UCo. Considering that even a short-term exposure can be harmful to health, the goal of the policy should be to keep cotinine concentration as low as possible.","Sim, Boram; Park, Myung-Bae",Int J Environ Res Public Health,286,1

METHODS: This double-blind randomized clinical trial study was conducted in the ICU wards of Golestan Hospital, Ahvaz, Iran, from September 2017 to March 2018. In this study, 52 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were selected by convenient sampling (26 patients in each group) and were randomly assigned to two groups of melatonin and control. Sedation and pain management package was applied to both groups. Outcomes: Amount of the sedative and opioid drug; mechanical ventilation time; ICU staying time; Glasgow Coma Score; hemodynamic parameters. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between them in terms of demographic characteristics. Cumulative doses of morphine and mechanical ventilation time were significant in two groups. (P < 0.05) The mean length of ICU staying was not significant. Glasgow Coma Score on the 6th day was significant in two groups (P < 0.05). Diastolic blood pressure was significant between groups (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study presented that morphine consumption and mechanical ventilation time were significantly lower in the melatonin group than in the control. Also, rise in GCS in the melatonin group was faster in the melatonin group than in the control. The use of melatonin can be recommended for patients with ICH in the ICU for better outcomes.","Soltani, Farhad; Salari, Amir; Javaherforooshzadeh, Fatemeh; Nassajjian, Nozar; Kalantari, Farahmand",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,286,1

This study determined the sensitization profile of Filipinos to pollen using skin prick test (SPT) and pollen-specific ELISA. METHODS: Pollen from fifteen selected plant sources was collected and extracted for use in sensitization tests. Volunteers were interviewed for their clinical history prior to blood sampling and SPT. The blood samples collected were assessed using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The best panel of pollen allergens for the skin prick test was Mangifera indica (64%), Acacia auriculiformis (28%), Mimosa spp. (25%) Amaranthus spinosus (22%), Lantana camara (20%), Pilea microphylla (16%) and Dichanthium aristatum (15%). Young adults had more sensitizations to pollen than among early childhood and elderly. There were more allergic subjects that have rhinitis (61%) than asthma (42%) and atopic dermatitis (35%). Pollen-specific IgE levels show low percent reactivity as compared to the skin test with Cocos nucifera obtaining the highest IgE reactivity (21%). CONCLUSIONS: Pollen allergens from both arboreal and herbaceous plants used in this study yielded positive reactivities for both skin tests and specific IgE tests.","Sabit, Maureen; Wong, Cecil; Andaya, Agnes; Ramos, John Donnie",Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol,286,1

Innovations in printing technologies are required to promote the broad application of high-performance PSEs at a low cost. However, current printing techniques are still facing long-lasting challenges in addressing the conflict between printing speed and performance. To overcome this challenge, we developed a new corona-enabled electrostatic printing (CEP) technique for ultra-fast (milliseconds) roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing of binder-free multifunctional e-skins. The printing capability and controllability of CEP were investigated through parametric studies and microstructure observation. The electric field generation, material transfer, and particle amount and size selecting mechanisms were numerically and experimentally studied. CEP-printed graphene e-skins were demonstrated to possess an outstanding strain sensing performance. The binder-free feature of the CEP-assembled networks enables them to provide pressure sensitivity as low as 2.5 Pa and capability to detect acoustic signals of hundreds of hertz in frequency. Furthermore, the CEP technique was utilized to pattern different types of functional materials (e.g., graphene and thermochromic polymers) onto different substrates (e.g., tape and textile). Overall, this study demonstrated that CEP can be a novel contactless and ultra-fast manufacturing platform compatible with the R2R process for fabricating high-performance, scalable, and low-cost soft electronics.","Wang, Long; Kou, Rui; Shang, Zhaoru; Weng, Zijian; Zhu, Chaoyi; Zhong, Ying",ACS applied materials & interfaces,286,12

Previously its application to speech in noise has required separate knowledge about the speech and noise signals to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, a novel, blind equalization cancellation model is introduced that can use the mixed signals. This approach does not require any assumptions about particular sound source directions. It uses different strategies for positive and negative SNRs, with the switching between the two steered by a blind decision stage utilizing modulation cues. The output of the model is a single-channel signal with enhanced SNR, which we analyzed using the speech intelligibility index to compare speech intelligibility predictions. In a first experiment, the model was tested on experimental data obtained in a scenario with spatially separated target and masker signals. Predicted speech recognition thresholds were in good agreement with measured speech recognition thresholds with a root mean square error less than 1 dB. A second experiment investigated signals at positive SNRs, which was achieved using time compressed and low-pass filtered speech. The results demonstrated that binaural unmasking of speech occurs at positive SNRs and that the modulation-based switching strategy can predict the experimental results.","Hauth, Christopher F; Berning, Simon C; Kollmeier, Birger; Brand, Thomas",Trends in hearing,286,1

It involves inflammatory skin lesions with histopathological findings (granulomas) similar to CD, without connection to the gastrointestinal tract. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) has been suggested as a possible treatment option. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to identify and treat a consecutive series of patients with biopsy-proven metastatic CD and monitor wound healing using prospectively acquired outcomes. METHODS Pathology results of all patients with ongoing perineal wound-healing problems after proctectomy between 2005 and 2018 at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre were assessed for metastatic CD. Patients with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of perineal metastatic CD were offered HBO (40 daily sessions of 100% oxygen at 2.4 atmosphere absolute). Wound healing was monitored using photographs and standardised questionnaires (the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale and the Female Sexual Function Index) at baseline and 1 and 3 months after HBO. RESULTS Out of 13 patients in the cohort with persisting perineal wounds after proctectomy, six (46%) had biopsy results consistent with metastatic CD. Of these, three accepted treatment with HBO. All three patients were female. One patient had complete healing of her perineal wound; another patient showed initial improvement but had a flare of luminal and perineal disease at the 3-month follow-up. The third patient showed improvement solely in the questionnaires, with higher scores on all three questionnaires. CONCLUSION A high rate of metastatic CD was found in patients with ongoing wound-healing problems after proctectomy, implying that the disease might not be as rare in these selected patients as previously thought. HBO might be beneficial in the treatment of metastatic CD.","Lansdorp, Corine A; Buskens, Christianne J; Gecse, Krisztina B; D'Haens, Geert Ram; Van Hulst, Rob A",United European gastroenterology journal,286,28

The HA protein critically contributes to the exceptionally high pathogenicity of the 1918 influenza virus, but the mechanisms underlying cleavage activation of the 1918 HA have not been characterized. The neuraminidase (NA) protein of the 1918 influenza virus allows trypsin-independent growth in canine kidney cells (MDCK). However, it is at present unknown if the 1918 NA, like the NA of the closely related strain A/WSN/33, facilitates HA cleavage activation by recruiting the proprotease plasminogen. Moreover, it is not known which pulmonary proteases activate the 1918 HA. We provide evidence that NA-dependent, trypsin-independent cleavage activation of the 1918 HA is cell line dependent and most likely plasminogen independent since the 1918 NA failed to recruit plasminogen and neither exogenous plasminogen nor the presence of the A/WSN/33 NA promoted efficient cleavage of the 1918 HA. The transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS4 was found to be expressed in lung tissue and was shown to cleave the 1918 HA. Accordingly, coexpression of the 1918 HA with TMPRSS4 or the previously identified HA-processing protease TMPRSS2 allowed trypsin-independent infection by pseudotypes bearing the 1918 HA, indicating that these proteases might support 1918 influenza virus spread in the lung. In summary, we show that the previously reported 1918 NA-dependent spread of the 1918 influenza virus is a cell line-dependent phenomenon and is not due to plasminogen recruitment by the 1918 NA. Moreover, we provide evidence that TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 activate the 1918 HA by cleavage and therefore may promote viral spread in lung tissue.","Chaipan, Chawaree; Kobasa, Darwyn; Bertram, Stephanie; Glowacka, Ilona; Steffen, Imke; Tsegaye, Theodros Solomon; Takeda, Makoto; Bugge, Thomas H; Kim, Semi; Park, Youngwoo; Marzi, Andrea; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Journal of virology,286,30

Recently, we established a genetically engineered ornithine transcarbamylase-deficient (OTCD) pig strain. Here, we report its characterization and treatment responsiveness. OTCD pigs were obtained by mating an OTCD carrier female (OTC-Xc.186_190delXWT) with a wild-type male. Due to the X-linked recessive mode of inheritance, the disease phenotype emerged only in males. Medication with nitrogen-scavenging agents was based on a clinical protocol. OTCD pigs were born smaller than their wild-type and carrier littermates, showing anemia and faltering. Biochemically, high levels of urinary orotic acid and loss of OTC activity were observed. The natural life course of OTCD pigs was characterized by a decrease in arterial percentage saturation of oxygen and body temperature, as well as an increase in blood ammonia levels; the pigs died in 24.0 ± 5.0 h (mean ± SD, n = 6). The established standard medication composed with nitrogen-scavenging agents and transfusion nearly doubled the survival time to 42.4 ± 13.7 h (n = 6). Our OTCD pig model appropriately mimicked the human pathology.

METHODS Four pigs weighing 45 kg each, and one dog weighing 25 kg, underwent surgery via a transanal approach. The rectum was occluded transanally using a purse-string suture, approximately 3-4 cm from the anal verge. The rectal mucosa was incised circumferentially just distal to the purse-string. A SILS or GelPOINT port was inserted transanally. Transanal TME was assisted by laparoscopy and proceeded up to the peritoneal reflection. More proximal dissection, including IMA dissection, was performed along the retroperitoneal avascular plane by endoscopy alone and facilitated by CO2 insufflation. The IMA was clipped and divided endoscopically. The mobilized rectosigmoid were exteriorized transanally and transected. A colorectal anastomosis was performed using a circular stapler with a single stapling technique. RESULTS Endoscopic dissection of the IMA was successful in all five animals. The mean operation time was 125 minutes (range, 90-170 minutes). There were no intraoperative complications or hemodynamic instability. The mean length of the resected specimen was 14.4 cm (range, 12-16 cm). CONCLUSION A NOTES retroperitoneal approach to the IMA with CO2 insufflation and intact peritoneal covering overcame the difficulties of retraction and exposure of endoscopic dissection in animals.","Park, Sun Jin; Sohn, Dae Kyung; Chang, Tae Young; Jung, Yunho; Kim, Hyung Jin; Kim, Young Ill; Chun, Ho-Kyung",Annals of surgical treatment and research,286,31

A retrospective cohort analysis.,22.308102,5.969263,2021-04-01,"AIMS Patients with de novo chest pain are usually investigated non-invasively. The new UK-National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend CT coronary angiography (CTCA) for all patients, while European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends functional tests. We sought to compare the clinical utility and perform a cost analysis of these recommendations in two UK centres with different primary investigative strategies. METHODSRESULTS We compared two groups of patients, group A (n=667) and group B (n=654), with new onset chest pain in two neighbouring National Health Service hospitals, each primarily following either ESC (group A) or NICE (group B) guidance. We assessed the clinical utility of each strategy, including progression to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and revascularisation. We present a retrospective cost analysis in the context of UK tariff for stress echo (£176), CTCA (£220) and ICA (£1001). Finally, we sought to identify predictors of revascularisation in the whole population.Baseline characteristics in both groups were similar. The progression to ICA was comparable (9.9% vs 12.0%, p=0.377), with similar requirement for revascularisation (4.0% vs 5.0%.; p=0.532). The average cost of investigations per investigated patient was lower in group A (£279.66 vs £325.77), saving £46.11 per patient. The ESC recommended risk score (RS) was found to be the only predictor of revascularisation (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.06; p<0.001). CONCLUSION Both NICE and ESC-proposed strategies led to similar rates of ICA and need for revascularisation in discrete, but similar groups of patients. The SE-first approach had a lower overall cost by £46.11 per patient, and the ESC RS was the only variable correlated to revascularisation.","Papachristidis, Alexandros; Vaughan, George Frederick; Denny, Sarah J; Akbari, Tamim; Avornyo, Edith; Griffiths, Tracey; Saunders, Emma; Byrne, Jonathan; Monaghan, Mark J; Al Fakih, Khaled",Open heart,286,16

Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a neuroimaging technique used to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF; perfusion) to understand brain function and detect differences among groups. CBF differences have been detected in MDD, and may reveal biosignatures of disease-state. The current work aimed to discover and replicate differences in CBF between MDD participants and healthy controls (HC) as part of the EMBARC study. Participants underwent neuroimaging at baseline, prior to starting study medication, to investigate biosignatures in MDD. Relative CBF (rCBF) was calculated and compared between 106 MDD and 36 HC EMBARC participants (whole-brain Discovery); and 58 MDD EMBARC participants and 58 HC from the DLBS study (region-of-interest Replication). Both analyses revealed reduced rCBF in the right parahippocampus, thalamus, fusiform and middle temporal gyri, as well as the left and right insula, for those with MDD relative to HC. Both samples also revealed increased rCBF in MDD relative to HC in both the left and right inferior parietal lobule, including the supramarginal and angular gyri. Cingulate and prefrontal regions did not fully replicate. Lastly, significant associations were detected between rCBF in replicated regions and clinical measures of MDD chronicity. These results (1) provide reliable evidence for ASL in detecting differences in perfusion for multiple brain regions thought to be important in MDD, and (2) highlight the potential role of using perfusion as a biosignature of MDD.","Cooper, Crystal M; Chin Fatt, Cherise R; Liu, Peiying; Grannemann, Bruce D; Carmody, Thomas; Almeida, Jorge R C; Deckersbach, Thilo; Fava, Maurizio; Kurian, Benji T; Malchow, Ashley L; McGrath, Patrick J; McInnis, Melvin; Oquendo, Maria A; Parsey, Ramin V; Bartlett, Elizabeth; Weissman, Myrna; Phillips, Mary L; Lu, Hanzhang; Trivedi, Madhukar H",Molecular psychiatry,286,11

Worldwide, little is known about the effectiveness of trauma care system at different stages of development, from establishing a trauma centre, to implementing a trauma system and as trauma systems mature. The objective of this study is to extract and analyse data from research that evaluates mortality rates according to different stages of trauma system development globally. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The proposed review will comply with the checklist of the 'Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis'. In this review, only peer-reviewed articles written in English, human-related studies and published between January 2000 and December 2020 will be included. Articles will be retrieved from MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL. Additional articles will be identified from other sources such as references of included articles and author lists. Two independent authors will assess the eligibility of studies as well as critically appraise and assess the methodological quality of all included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias for Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool. Two independent authors will extract the data to minimise errors and bias during the process of data extraction using an extraction tool developed by the authors. For analysis calculation, effect sizes will be expressed as risk ratios or ORs for dichotomous data or weighted (or standardised) mean differences and 95% CIs for continuous data in this systematic review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This systematic review will use secondary data only, therefore, research ethics approval is not required. The results from this study will be submitted to a peer-review journal for publication and we will present our findings at national and international conferences.

While in theory complementary, both PCR and serologic tests have practical shortcomings. A retrospective study was performed in order to further define these limitations in a clinical context and to determine how to best utilize these tests in a coherent fashion. A total of 3,075 patients underwent both PCR and serology tests at UCLA in the study period. Among these, 2731 (89%) had no positive tests at all, 73 (2%) had a positive PCR test and only negative serology tests, 144 (5%) had a positive serology test and only negative PCR tests, and 127 (4%) had positive PCR and serology tests. Approximately half of the patients with discordant results (i.e. PCR positive, serology negative or vice versa) had mistimed tests in reference to the course of their disease. PCR positive patients who were asymptomatic or pregnant were less likely to generate a detectable humoral immune response to SARS-Cov2. On a quantitative level, the log number of days between symptom onset and PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were positively correlated. However, there was no apparent relationship between PCR Ct and serologic AU/ml results.","Murad, Douglas; Chandrasekaran, Sukantha; Pallai, Ajaya; Garner, Omai B; Denny, Christopher T",Journal of clinical microbiology,286,27

Delays in routine healthcare and immunization have led to a rise in concerns about resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases around the world. With the release and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, plans to improve immunization rates need to be explored and implemented across disciplines. One approach would be the consideration of perioperative vaccinations; however, the effects of anesthesia and surgery on the immune response and complications associated with vaccination during the perioperative period are still poorly understood, and opinions are divided. To ascertain the value of a perioperative vaccination program, it is important to understand the basics of immunization and common vaccinations; the potential vaccine complications in the pediatric cohort; the implications of anesthesia and surgery on the immune response; and current recommendations. In addition, we believe it is important to discuss the logistics and feasibility of coordinating perioperative immunization should this become a regular opportunity.","Lin, Connie; Vazquez-Colon, Caroll; Geng-Ramos, Giuliana; Challa, Chaitanya",Paediatric anaesthesia,286,1

METHODS The participants included 60 adolescents with dysmenorrhea and 41 healthy adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18. This study used the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) for assessing the perceptions of quality of life, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for measuring anxiety levels, and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) for measuring depression levels. RESULTS It was determined that compared to healthy controls, the depression and anxiety scores were higher and the quality of life was impaired in adolescents with dysmenorrhea. In addition, it was shown that the depression and anxiety levels increased and the psychosocial health subscale scores of quality of life decreased with increasing dysmenorrhea severity. However, the likelihood of dysmenorrhea was found to be higher with increasing depression scores, while the anxiety levels had no effect on dysmenorrhea. CONCLUSION In dysmenorrhea management, it is important to enhance awareness among pediatric clinicians and gynecologists regarding the associations between dysmenorrhea and mental problems.","Sahin, Nilfer; Kasap, Burcu; Kirli, Ulviye; Yeniceri, Nese; Topal, Yasar",Reproductive health,286,30

METHODS The study was conducted in the oncology day care clinic at a tertiary care center and included a selected group of patients with various oncological conditions who required IV chemotherapy. In each patient a newly inserted peripheral IV catheter or newly accessed central line was deemed positively intravascular if they had good blood return or most probably intravascular if there was no blood return but they flushed easily. This clinical diagnosis of correct positioning, was correlated with the results of a single injection of dilute sodium on the exhaled carbon dioxide, and with the ability of a blinded observer to report whether sodium bicarbonate or saline was injected. RESULTS A total of 67 patients were enrolled in the study; 56 had positively intravascular IV catheter while 11 had most probably intravascular IV catheter. A single injection of 20 mL 4.2% sodium bicarbonate had a positive and clinically detectable response that was diagnosed with high sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS IV injection of 20 mL of 4.2% sodium bicarbonate with exhaled carbon dioxide monitoring can be used to reliably confirm correct intravascular placement of a catheter intended to be used for chemotherapy.","Keidan, Ilan; Ben-Menachem, Erez; Berger, Raanan; Derazne, Estella; Berkenstadt, Haim",The journal of vascular access,286,1

This review sought the views of primary care clinicians using eConsult. METHOD An 18-item survey was constructed after an initial scoping survey. This was then distributed to primary care clinicians in Defence Primary Healthcare to assess the broader applicability of the themes identified. Data synthesis of this alongside free-text responses from respondents was undertaken to explore advantages and disadvantages of eConsult. RESULTS Four themes were identified: accessibility, effects on working practices, impact on the dynamics of the consultation and training/administrative support. eConsult did not save time for clinicians but was generally more convenient for patients. eConsult was often used in conjunction with telephone and face-to-face follow-up, forming a 'blended consultation'. Accessibility was improved, but cultural factors may affect some patients engaging. CONCLUSIONS eConsult improves accessibility for patients but does not reduce workload. It should be used alongside conventional access methods, not instead of. It was found to be useful for straightforward clinical and administrative problems but less useful for more complex cases unless part of a 'blended consultation'. Future use could be modified to provide greater data gathering for occupational health and chronic disease monitoring and should be monitored to ensure it is inclusive of all demographic groups.","Willman, Antony Sean",BMJ military health,286,16

However, evidence concerning the midterm efficacy and safety of AMIC are limited. This study assessed reliability and feasibility of AMIC at 60 months follow-up. We hypothesize that AMIC leads to good clinical outcome at midterm follow-up. METHODS Surgeries were approached with an arthrotomy via malleolar osteotomy. A resorbable porcine I/III collagen membrane (Chondro-Gide®, Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) was used. Patients were followed at 24 and 60 months. The primary outcome of interest was to analyse the Foot Function Index (FFI), and the subscale hindfoot of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS). Complications such as failure, revision surgeries, graft delamination, and hypertrophy were also recorded. The secondary outcome of interest was to investigate the association between the clinical outcome and patient characteristics at admission. RESULTS Data from 19 patients were included. The mean age at admission was 47.3 ± 13.2 years, and the mean BMI 24.1 ± 4.9 kg/m2. 53% (10 of 19 patients) were female. At a mean of 66.2 ± 11.6 months, the FFI decreased at 24-months follow-up of 22.5% (P = 0.003) and of further 1.3% (P = 0.8) at 60-months follow-up. AOFAS increased at 24-months follow-up of 17.2% (P = 0.003) and of further 3.4 (P = 0.2) at 60-months follow-up. There were two symptomatic recurrences within the follow-up in two patients. There was evidence of a strong positive association between FFI and AOFAS at baseline and the same scores last follow-up (P = 0.001 and P = 0.0002, respectively). CONCLUSION AMIC enhanced with cancellous bone graft demonstrated efficacy and feasibility for osteochondral defects of the talus at five years follow-up. The greatest improvement was evidenced within the first two years. These results suggest that clinical outcome is influenced by the preoperative status of the ankle. High quality studies involving a larger sample size are required to detect seldom complications and identify prognostic factors leading to better clinical outcome.

When β-CoV infects the respiratory tract, it can cause mild and/or severe acute respiratory syndrome with consequent release of cytokines/mediators, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8(CXCL8), IL-10, IP10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, IL-33, IL-25, IL-37, IL-38, GCSF, GM-CSF, HGF,IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α(also known as CCL3), IFN-γ, IFN-α, TRAIL, MCSF and TNF-α. Our hypothesis of writing this article can be summarized as; if the monoclonal antibody administered by us does not inhibit the immune response for the β-CoV and inhibits uncontrolled-adaptive/hyperimmune responses (also called cytokine storm) on endothelium level, then it may cause severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Anakinra is a human IL-1 receptor antagonist. By inhibiting IL-1α/IL-1β competitively from binding to the IL-1 type-I receptor, anakinra, neutralizes the activity that pertains to these key mediators of autoinflammatory and/or immune processes. Tocilizumab is a blocker of IL-6R that can effectively block IL-6 signal transduction pathway. Omalizumab that binds to the CH3 domain, is near to the binding site for the high-affinity IgE Fc receptors type-I of human IgE. Myocardial, lung and hepatorenal injury in patients with Covid-19 could be due to cytokine storm, hypoxic injury, or/and direct endothelial/vasculer injury.

A literature review examining this topic was undertaken and is presented here, combined with insights from our experience in managing patients with laryngeal complications following mechanical ventilation for severe COVID-19 pneumonitis. RECENT FINDINGS Naunheim et al. reported that patients who are most at risk of needing intubation with COVID-19 disease are those with patient-specific risk factors and these are at an increased risk for subsequent laryngotracheal injury following intubation (1). In our cohort of 105 patients referred with laryngological symptoms postintubation for COVID-19 pneumonitis, 40% presented as urgent reviews, of which almost half had severe postintubation complications requiring surgery. Perceptual voice ratings and patient-reported voice ratings varied widely, but there was no significant change in voice scores postoperatively. The reflux symptom index (RSI) scores did improve significantly (p = 0.0266). The need for surgery was associated with the presence of comorbidities for instance hypertension, diabetes and obesity in our cohort. This is in support of reported association of comorbidity as a risk factor for intubation and subsequent development of postintubation airway complications. SUMMARY Dysphonia following COVID-19 infection may have multiple causes. Literature reports demonstrate intubation injury, sensory neuropathy, and postviral neuropathy are associated with voice changes. Our personal experience has confirmed postintubation injury markedly affects glottic function with resultant dysphonia attributable to scar formation, posterior glottic stenosis, granulation and subglottic stenosis. Frequent surgical intervention is required for airway patency and may have short-term further deleterious effects on phonation, although in our cohort this is not statistically significant analysing Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain, Voice Handicap Index-10 or Airway, Voice, Swallow scores. Maximal antireflux medications and advice statistically improved RSI scores postoperatively.","Watson, Natalie A; Karagama, Yakubu; Burnay, Victoria; Boztepe, Selda; Warner, Susan; Chevretton, Elfy B",Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery,286,5

Messages grounded on tacit assumptions that older people are frail, incompetent, and needy risk being overlooked by most of the older population; on the other hand, ignoring age-associated vulnerabilities is problematic. We argue that while traditional approaches to market segmentation based on chronological age often fail, reliable age differences in motivation can inform the types of information that older people typically prefer, attend to, and remember. Socioemotional selectivity theory maintains that as future time horizons grow limited - as they typically do with age - emotional goals are prioritized over goals that focus on exploration. As time left becomes more limited, positive messages are remembered better than negative, and products that help people savor the moment are preferred over those that benefit the long-term future. Relatedly, acknowledging individual strengths and personal resilience are likely to be especially appealing to older people.","Carstensen, Laura L; Hershfield, Hal E",Current directions in psychological science,286,16

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells are involved in maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity during the development. However, whether oligodendrocyte precursor cell could sustain blood-brain barrier permeability during ischemic brain injury is unknown. Here, we investigate whether oligodendrocyte precursor cell transplantation protects blood-brain barrier integrity and promotes ischemic stroke recovery. Adult male ICR mice (n = 68) underwent 90 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. After ischemic assault, these mice received stereotactic injection of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (6 × 105). Oligodendrocyte precursor cells transplantation alleviated edema and infarct volume, and promoted neurological recovery after ischemic stroke. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells reduced blood-brain barrier leakage via increasing claudin-5, occludin and β-catenin expression. Administration of β-catenin inhibitor blocked the beneficial effects of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Wnt7a protein treatment increased β-catenin and claudin-5 expression in endothelial cells after oxygen-glucose deprivation, which was similar to the results of the conditioned medium treatment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells on endothelial cells. We demonstrated that oligodendrocyte precursor cells transplantation protected blood-brain barrier in the acute phase of ischemic stroke via activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Our results indicated that oligodendrocyte precursor cells transplantation was a novel approach to the ischemic stroke therapy.","Wang, Liping; Geng, Jieli; Qu, Meijie; Yuan, Fang; Wang, Yuyang; Pan, Jiaji; Li, Yongfang; Ma, Yuanyuan; Zhou, Panting; Zhang, Zhijun; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Cell death & disease,286,17

The aim of this study was to optimize tissue engineering therapy of muscle constructs using a rat model. METHODS Experimental abdominal wall defects were created in Wister rats. The animal model was divided into three groups: collagen sponge (CS), hybrid scaffold (HS) and hybrid scaffold containing bone marrow liquid (HSBM). Hybrid scaffolds comprised collagen sponge and poly L-lactide (PLLA) sheets. Abdominal wall defects were covered by three kinds of sheets. Thereafter, the bone marrow liquid was spread onto the sheets. Rats were killed at 4, 8, and 16 weeks. Pathological examinations were performed using hematoxylin-eosin and desmin antibody staining. RESULTS The CS group showed abdominal hernia, whereas the HS and HSBM groups did not. Vascular formation was confirmed in all groups. Muscle tissue was recognized at the marginal area of the sheet only in the HSBM group. CONCLUSION The HS and HSBM groups show a greater intensity than the CS group. Muscle tissue regeneration is solely recognized in the HSBM group. Our experimental data suggest that the triad of scaffold, cell, and growth factor is fundamental for ideal biomaterials. The HSBM may be useful for reconstruction of abdominal wall defects.","Suzuhigashi, Masaya; Kaji, Tatsuru; Nakame, Kazuhiko; Mukai, Motoi; Yamada, Waka; Onishi, Shun; Yamada, Koji; Kawano, Takafumi; Takamatsu, Hideo; Ieiri, Satoshi",Pediatric surgery international,286,31

Once the decision to prescribe an antimicrobial is made, the choice of antimicrobial should be based on both the benefits and adverse effects. This systematic review quantifies the occurrence of common adverse events (AEs) related to FQs in relation to any other antimicrobial for any indication in primary care. METHODS We searched randomized controlled trials from Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and CINHAL. FQs had to be administered orally, for any indication, to adults and in primary care. Data were extracted independently in standard forms in ""Covidence"". Pooled estimates of the intervention effects for AEs were determined by the Peto odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in Revman. RESULTS In the 39 studies selected, the most commonly reported AEs were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, dizziness, and rash. A meta-analysis of 28 studies reporting AEs showed central nervous system (CNS)-related AEs (OR 1.40 (1.12-1.75) P = 0.003, heterogeneity (I2) = 0%) and gastrointestinal (GI)-related AEs (OR 1.20 (1.06-1.36) P = 0.005, I2 = 80%) were significantly associated with FQs compared with other antimicrobials. Compared with FQs, co-amoxiclav showed significantly more total AEs (OR 0.70 (0.54-0.90) P = 0.006, I2 = 78%) and GI-related AEs (OR 0.69 (0.52-0.91) P = 0.008, I2 = 94%). Withdrawal or discontinuation due to drug-related AEs was higher for FQs (OR 1.19 (1.00-1.42) P = 0.05, I2 = 5%). Sensitivity analyses did not change these results. CONCLUSION FQs are associated with more CNS- and GI-related AEs compared with other types of antimicrobial. This information is relevant to support decision making in relation to antimicrobial prescribing.","Tandan, M; Cormican, M; Vellinga, A",International journal of antimicrobial agents,286,1

Many viral proteins specifically interact with host-cell proteins to promote virus biology. Understanding these interactions can lead to knowledge gains about infection and provide potential targets for antiviral therapy. One such virus is Ebola, which has profound consequences for human health and causes viral hemorrhagic fever where case fatality rates can approach 90%. The Ebola virus VP24 protein plays a critical role in the evasion of the host immune response and is likely to interact with multiple cellular proteins. To map these interactions and better understand the potential functions of VP24, label-free quantitative proteomics was used to identify cellular proteins that had a high probability of forming the VP24 cellular interactome. Several known interactions were confirmed, thus placing confidence in the technique, but new interactions were also discovered including one with ATP1A1, which is involved in osmoregulation and cell signaling. Disrupting the activity of ATP1A1 in Ebola-virus-infected cells with a small molecule inhibitor resulted in a decrease in progeny virus, thus illustrating how quantitative proteomics can be used to identify potential therapeutic targets.","García-Dorival, Isabel; Wu, Weining; Dowall, Stuart; Armstrong, Stuart; Touzelet, Olivier; Wastling, Jonathan; Barr, John N; Matthews, David; Carroll, Miles; Hewson, Roger; Hiscox, Julian A",Journal of proteome research,286,1

Its specificity, potency, and ease of use on isolated tissues and cells have made it a powerful pharmacological tool to identify and probe the physiological function of MSCs. In some contexts, however, it would be desirable to deliver the toxin in a controlled way in vivo. Here we describe a novel tool to allow spatial and temporal control of GsMTx4 delivery in vivo in Drosophila. To test the tool, we targeted MSCs required for mechanical nociception in a specific subset of sensory neurons in intact larvae. Expression of GsMTx4 in these neurons results in robust inhibition of mechanical nociception, demonstrating the toxin is active when expressed in vivo. The tool will be particularly useful to manipulate MSC activity in a spatially and temporally-controlled manner to study their role in development, physiology and behaviour in intact, free moving animals.","Beqja, Denis; Haidar, Sunna; Nikolaev, Mihail; Shen, Yilan; Denholm, Barry",Journal of insect physiology,286,16

In contrast, only recently has it been possible to identify viruses in the stools of patients with diarrhoea. Initially, such identifications were made by electron microscopy but the unsuitability of the microscope for large-scale screening has led to the development of other methods. The new methods have concentrated on rotaviruses but other viruses are also implicated and an overall view of the significance of finding a virus in any stool specimen has to take into account the evidence about all viruses, old and new.","Madeley, C R",Journal of clinical pathology,286,1

METHODS Totally 531 samples (including urine, stool, and OWF) were collected from 177 convalescence patients with positive SARS antibody which were confirmed by ELISA method. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV, and results were analyzed by SPSS analysis software. RESULTS There were 49 (27.7%) cases of SARS-CoV RNA detection positive in 177 patients, including 31 (17.5%) cases with one sample positive, 14 (7.9%) cases with two samples positive, and 4 (2.3%) cases with three samples positive. The positive rates of urine, stool, and OWF were 14.7% (26/177), 11.9% (21/177), and 13.6% (24/177), respectively. The quantity of SARS-CoV RNA in samples was 100-47 000 copies/ml. No significant difference was found among urine, stool, and OWF on the difference grade quantity of SARS-CoV RNA quantity. CONCLUSIONS About 10% convalescence SARS patients might still carry the SARS-CoV in hospitalization.

Determining infection rate is difficult due to the limits on testing and the high rate of asymptomatic individuals. Detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may be useful for determining prior exposure to the virus and assessing mitigation strategies, such as isolation, masks, and other protective equipment. METHODS: An online assessment that included demographic, clinical, and exposure information and a blood sample was collected from 20,614 participants out of ~43,000 total employees at Beaumont Health, which includes eight hospitals distributed across the Detroit metropolitan area in southeast Michigan. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined using the EUROIMMUN assay. RESULTS: A total of 1,818 (8.8%) participants were seropositive between April 13 and May 28, 2020. Among the seropositive individuals, 44% reported that they were asymptomatic during the month prior to blood collection. Healthcare roles such as phlebotomy, respiratory therapy, and nursing/nursing support exhibited significantly higher seropositivity. Among participants reporting direct exposure to a COVID-19 positive individual, those wearing an N95/PAPR mask had a significantly lower seropositivity rate (10.2%) compared to surgical/other masks (13.1%) or no mask (17.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Direct contact with COVID-19 patients increased the likelihood of seropositivity among employees but study participants who wore a mask during COVID-19 exposures were less likely to be seropositive. Additionally, a large proportion of seropositive employees self-reported as asymptomatic.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seroprevalence approaches 80% in the elderly. CMV has been shown to accelerate immune ageing by affecting peripheral blood T cell phenotypes and increasing inflammatory mediated cytokines such as IL-6. The elderly with pre-existing but clinically silent CMV infection may therefore be particularly susceptible to severe Covid-19 disease and succumb to a cytokine storm which may have been promoted by CMV.

For a network with a single weight, previous studies have shown that they can promote synchronization. But for complex networks with multi-weights, there are no rigorous analysis to show that synchronization can be reached faster. In this paper, the complex network is allowed to be directed, which will make the synchronization analysis difficult for multiple couplings. In virtue of the normalized left eigenvectors (NLEVec) corresponding to the zero eigenvalue of coupling matrices, we prove that if the Chebyshev distance between NLEVec is less than some value, which is defined as the allowable deviation bound, then the synchronization and control will be realized with sufficiently large coupling strengths, i.e., all coupling matrices do accelerate synchronization. Moreover, adaptive rules are also designed for the coupling strength.","Liu, Xiwei",,286,1

Unfortunately, kidney transplant recipients are a high-risk group during the disease course, and scientific data are still limited in this patient group. Beyond the dosage of immunosuppressive drugs, pharmacological immunosuppression may also alter the infection response in the COVID-19 course. The effects of immunosuppressive agents on the development and process of infection should not be decided only by determining how potent they are and how much they suppress the immune system; it is also thought that the direct effect of the virus, increased oxidative stress, and cytokine storm play a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease. There are data about immunosuppressive drugs like calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) therapy related to their beneficial effects during any infection course.

Other than the profound severe pulmonary damage, SARS-CoV-2 infection also leads to a series of cardiovascular abnormalities, including myocardial injury, myocarditis and pericarditis, arrhythmia and cardiac arrest, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and coagulation abnormalities. Meanwhile, COVID-19 patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases are often at a much higher risk of increased morbidity and mortality. Up-to-date, a number of mechanisms have been postulated for COVID-19-associated cardiovascular damage including SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activation, cytokine storm, hypoxemia, stress and cardiotoxicity of antiviral drugs. In this context, special attention should be given towards COVID-19 patients with concurrent cardiovascular diseases, and special cardiovascular attention is warranted for treatment of COVID-19.","Wu, Lin; O039,; Kane, Aislinn M; Peng, Hu; Bi, Yaguang; Motriuk-Smith, Dagmara; Ren, Jun",Biochem Pharmacol,286,16

The Department of Laboratory Medicine of La Paz University Hospital in Madrid (LMD-HULP) was designated to provide laboratory services. Due to the emergency, the IFEMA field hospital had to be prepared for patient admission in less than 1 week and the laboratory professionals had to collaborate in a multidisciplinary group to assure that resources were available to start on time. The LMD-HULP participated together with the managers in the design of the tests portfolio and the integration of the healthcare information systems (IS) (hospital IS, laboratory IS and POCT management system). Laboratorians developed a strategy to quickly train clinicians and nurses on test requests, sample collection procedures and management/handling of the POCT blood gas analyser both by written materials and training videos. The IFEMA´s preanalytical unit managed 3782 requests, and more than 11,000 samples from March 27th to April 30th. Furthermore, 1151 samples were measured by blood gas analysers. In conclusion, laboratory professionals must be resilient and have to respond timely in emergencies as this pandemic.

Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is a well-established, safe, viral vector for gene delivery with multiple naturally occurring and artificial serotypes available displaying alternate cell, tissue, and species-specific tropisms. Efficient AAV serotypes for the transduction of the conducting airways have been identified for several species; however, efficient serotypes for human lung parenchyma have not yet been identified. Here, we screened the ability of multiple AAV serotypes to transduce lung bud organoids (LBOs)-a model of human lung parenchyma generated from human embryonic stem cells. Microinjection of LBOs allowed us to model transduction from the luminal surface, similar to dosing via vector inhalation. We identified the naturally occurring rAAV2 and rAAV6 serotypes, along with synthetic rAAV6 variants, as having tropism for the human lung parenchyma. Positive staining of LBOs for surfactant proteins B and C confirmed distal lung identity and suggested the suitability of these vectors for the transduction of alveolar type II cells. Our findings establish LBOs as a new model for pulmonary gene therapy and stress the relevance of LBOs as a viral infection model of the lung parenchyma as relevant in SARS-CoV-2 research.","Meyer-Berg, Helena; Zhou Yang, Lucia; Pilar de Lucas, María; Zambrano, Alberto; Hyde, Stephen C; Gill, Deborah R",Stem Cell Res Ther,286,26

Given the uncertainty associated with such an innovative context, experimentation is a valuable approach for these companies, especially in the early stages of the development, when implementing unnecessary features represents a higher risk for companies' survival. Nevertheless, researchers have argued that the lack of clearly defined practices led to limited adoption of experimentation. In this regard, the first step is to define the hypotheses based on which teams will create experiments. Objective: We aim to develop a systematic technique to identify hypotheses for early-stage software startups. Methods: We followed a Design Science approach consisted of three cycles in the construction phase, that involved seven startups in total, and an evaluation of the final artifact within three startups. Results: We developed the HyMap, a hypotheses elicitation technique based on cognitive mapping. It consists of a visual language to depict a cognitive map representing the founder's understanding of the product, and a process to elicit this map consisted of a series of questions the founder must answer. Our evaluation showed that the artifacts are clear, easy to use, and useful leading to hypotheses and facilitating founders to visualize their idea. Conclusion: Our study contributes to both descriptive and prescriptive bodies of knowledge. Regarding the first, it provides a better understanding of the guidance founders use to develop their startups and, for the latter, a technique to identify hypotheses in early-stage software startups.","Melegati, Jorge; Guerra, Eduardo; Wang, Xiaofeng",,286,1

Starting with the approval of anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) for advanced-stage melanoma in 2011, ICIs-which now also include antibodies against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1)-quickly gained US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of a wide array of cancer types, demonstrating unprecedented extension of patient survival. However, despite the success of ICIs, resistance to these agents restricts the number of patients able to achieve durable responses, and immune-related adverse events complicate treatment. Thus, a better understanding of the requirements for an effective and safe antitumor immune response following ICI therapy is needed. Studies of both tumoral and systemic changes in the immune system following ICI therapy have yielded insight into the basis for both efficacy and resistance. Ultimately, by building on these insights, researchers should be able to combine ICIs with other agents, or design new immunotherapies, to achieve broader and more durable efficacy as well as greater safety. Here, we review the history and clinical utility of ICIs, the mechanisms of resistance to therapy, and local and systemic immune cell changes associated with outcome.

In this study, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based biosensing platform consisting of a recombinant ACE2-coated palladium nano-thin-film electrode as the core sensing element was fabricated for the screening of potential inhibitors against S-protein-ACE2 binding. The platform could detect interference of small analytes against S-protein-ACE2 binding at low analyte concentration and small volume (0.1 µg/mL and ~1 µL, estimated total analyte consumption < 4 pg) within 21 min. Thus, a few potential inhibitors of S-protein-ACE2 binding were identified.

Neoliberalism has occasioned a wide-ranging reconstitution of profit accumulation, politics, society, and the individual ‘citizen’ not least as part of the construction of a new collective common sense. The contention of this paper is that Moroccan language policy/politics is articulated amidst this neoliberal capture. It unfolds in a discursive and institutional environment characterized by uneven, dispersed but dense topographies of neoliberalization, in turn carved up by the political rationalities of state-sanctioned capital accumulation, reproduction and governmentality. While tokenistically congenial to linguistic pluralism, the Moroccan language regime espouses a marked neoliberal reconfiguration of language and multilingualism. The Moroccan language regime appears to have congealed into a neoliberal linguistic consensus predicated on neoliberal multilingualism, a stratified matrix of linguistic differentiation informed by the ideologies and structures of neoliberal political economy and practices of power. Embedded in this regime is linguistic governmentality, the linguistically sanctioned nurturing of neoliberal subjectivity couched within the coordinates of performativity and the neoliberal discursive assortments of human capital, the knowledge economy, employability and lifelong learning. This paper attempts to sketch the lineaments of this evolving linguistic regime with a view to rendering visible the spaces of interplay between neoliberal governance and language politics. The paper concludes with a reflection on the implications for the analysis of potential permutations of neoliberalism under Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to effectively prioritize patients who are symptomatic for testing to assist early COVID-19 detection in Brazil, addressing problems related to inefficient testing and control strategies. METHODS: Raw data from 55,676 Brazilians were preprocessed, and the chi-square test was used to confirm the relevance of the following features: gender, health professional, fever, sore throat, dyspnea, olfactory disorders, cough, coryza, taste disorders, and headache. Classification models were implemented relying on preprocessed data sets; supervised learning; and the algorithms multilayer perceptron (MLP), gradient boosting machine (GBM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). The models' performances were analyzed using 10-fold cross-validation, classification metrics, and the Friedman and Nemenyi statistical tests. The permutation feature importance method was applied for ranking the features used by the classification models with the highest performances. RESULTS: Gender, fever, and dyspnea were among the highest-ranked features used by the classification models. The comparative analysis presents MLP, GBM, DT, RF, XGBoost, and SVM as the highest performance models with similar results. KNN and LR were outperformed by the other algorithms. Applying the easy interpretability as an additional comparison criterion, the DT was considered the most suitable model. CONCLUSIONS: The DT classification model can effectively (with a mean accuracy&#8805;89.12%) assist COVID-19 test prioritization in Brazil. The model can be applied to recommend the prioritizing of a patient who is symptomatic for COVID-19 testing.","Viana Dos Santos Santana, Íris; Cm da Silveira, Andressa; Sobrinho, Álvaro; Chaves E Silva, Lenardo; Dias da Silva, Leandro; Santos, Danilo F S; Gurjão, Edmar C; Perkusich, Angelo",J Med Internet Res,286,13

As pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases can spread the disease between populations through travel, it is important to incorporate mobility between populations into the epidemiological modelling. In this work, we propose to modify the commonly-used SEIR model to account for the dynamic flight network, by estimating the imported cases based on the air traffic volume as well as the test positive rate at the source. This modification, called Flight-SEIR, can potentially enable 1). early detection of outbreaks due to imported pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, 2). more accurate estimation of the reproduction number and 3). evaluation of the impact of travel restrictions and the implications of lifting these measures. The proposed Flight-SEIR is essential in navigating through this pandemic and the next ones, given how interconnected our world has become.","Ding, Xiaoye; Huang, Shenyang; Leung, Abby; Rabbany, Reihaneh",,286,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 21 patients clinically suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and underwent chest CT more than 3 days after the symptom onset: six patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 15 patients proved uninfected. Using a Likert scale and its receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, two radiologists (R1/R2) evaluated the diagnostic performance of the five CT criteria: (1) ground glass opacity (GGO)-predominant lesions, (2) GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions, (3) bilateral GGO-predominant lesions; (4) bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions, and (5) bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions without nodules, airway abnormalities, pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. RESULTS: All patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia had bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions without airway abnormalities, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. The five CT criteria showed moderate to excellent diagnostic performance with area under the curves (AUCs) ranging 0.77-0.88 for R1 and 0.78-0.92 for R2. The criterion (e) showed the highest AUC. CONCLUSION: Chest CT would play a supplemental role to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other respiratory diseases presenting with similar symptoms in a clinical setting.","Himoto, Yuki; Sakata, Akihiko; Kirita, Mitsuhiro; Hiroi, Takashi; Kobayashi, Ken-Ichiro; Kubo, Kenji; Kim, Hyunjin; Nishimoto, Azusa; Maeda, Chikara; Kawamura, Akira; Komiya, Nobuhiro; Umeoka, Shigeaki",Jpn J Radiol,286,20

METHODS: This is a prospective study enrolling all ACHD patients who answered a questionnaire dedicated telematic cardiovascular examination. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients were enrolled, 133 (47%) were male, 25 (9%) were affected by a genetic syndrome. The median age was 38 (29-51) years, whereas the median time interval between the last visit and the telematic follow-up was 9.5 (7.5-11.5) months. Overall, 35 patients (12%) reported a worsening of fatigue in daily life activity, 17 (6%) experienced chest pain, 42 (15%) had presyncope and 2 (1%) syncope; in addition, 28 patients (10%) presented peripheral edema and 14 (5%) were orthopneic. A total of 116 (40%) patients reported palpitations and 12 had at least one episode of atrial fibrillation and underwent successful electrical (8) or pharmacological (4) cardioversion. One patient was admitted to the emergency department for uncontrolled arterial hypertension, five for chest pain, and one for heart failure. Two patients presented fever but both had negative COVID-19 nasal swab.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: To assess the rate at which an infectious disease can spread in a population, the 2 measures, R0 and Re or Rt, are widely used. One of the parameters which influence the calculations is the SI, the period between symptom onset in an infector and an infectee. METHODS: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct searching up to May 10, 2020, was performed. A continuous random-effect model was applied using the DerSimonian-Laird (inverse variance) method. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 39 articles met the eligibility criteria. Our results demonstrated the mean SI was 5.45 days, with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 4.23 to 6.66. Pooled estimates for reproduction rates was 3.14 (95% CI: 2.69-3.59) for R0 and 3.18 (95% CI: 2.89-3.47) for Rt. Subgroup analysis by geographical region and date of publication revealed variations over both time and geography in calculated R0 and Rt values. As time has progressed, predicted R0 and Rt values had decreased globally. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings indicate that one SARS-CoV-2-infected person is likely to infect 3 persons, supporting that COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease. As an essential objective metrics implied in risk assessment for this emerging pandemic, monitoring R0 and Re is necessary to indicate the effectiveness or failures of mitigation efforts.","Hussein, Mohammad; Toraih, Eman; Elshazli, Rami; Fawzy, Manal; Houghton, August; Tatum, Danielle; Killackey, Mary; Kandil, Emad; Duchesne, Juan",Ann. surg,286,20

In this study, we further investigated the nature of N protein cleavage using various methods including protease cleavage assays with or without various inhibitors and mutagenesis study. We found that PEDV 8aa infection in Vero cells leads to apoptotic cell death, and caspase 6 or 7 can cleave PEDV 8aa N protein at the late stage of the replication. The caspase-mediated cleavage occurs between D424 and G425 near the C-terminal of N protein. We also report that both cleaved and uncleaved N proteins are exclusively localized in the cytoplasm of PEDV infected cells.","Oh, Changin; Kim, Yunjeong; Chang, Kyeong-Ok",Virus Res,286,1

METHODS: Aerosol generation during phacoemulsification was assessed using a model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial anterior chamber. Typical phacoemulsification settings were used and visible aerosol production was recorded using high-speed 4K camera. Aerosolisation was evaluated under various experimental settings: Two different phacoemulsification tip sizes (2.2, 2.75 mm), varying levels of corneal moisture, the use of suction and blowing air in the surgical field, the use of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) coating of the cornea with a static and moving tip. RESULTS: This model demonstrates visible aerosol generation during phacoemulsification with a 2.75-mm phacoemulsification tip. No visible aerosol was noted with a 2.2-mm tip. The presence of visible aerosol was unrelated to corneal wetting. Suction in close proximity to the aerosol plume did not impact on its dispersion. Blowing air redirected the aerosol plume toward the ocular surface. Visible aerosol production was abolished when HPMC was used to coat the cornea. This effect lasted for an average of 67 ± 8 s in the static model. Visible aerosol generation was discerned during movement of the 2.2-mm tip toward the corneal wound. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate visible aerosol production in the setting of a model of clear corneal phacoemulsification. Visible aerosol can be reduced using a 2.2-mm phacoemulsification tip and reapplying HPMC every minute during phacoemulsification.","Darcy, Kieren; Elhaddad, Omar; Achiron, Asaf; Keller, Johannes; Leadbetter, Duncan; Tole, Derek; Liyanage, Sidath",,286,26

However noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is yet not a common practice internationally because of lack of global evidence advocating its effective use in severe cases of ARDS as well as dreadful concern about aerosol generation especially in patients having COVID-19 infection. Objective: To determine whether, NIPPV application is effective and safe in COVID-19 Patients. Methods: One hundred and thirty hemodynamically stable patients with severe CARDS as per Berlin definition (PaO2/FiO2 ratio <= 100mm Hg), having GCS > 13, respiratory breathing index (RBI) < 105, and without any systemic complication were selected. They were managed with NIPPV in Corona Intensive Care Unit of Mayo Hospital/King Edward Medical University Lahore. A little innovation was done with the application of a specific orofacial interface, fitted with heat and moist exchanger (HME) at the interface and viral/bacterial filters at the expiratory limb of ventilatory circuit. Favorable outcome has been observed in 64% of treated cases in terms of improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio, thus abating severity of ARDS from severe to mild category, in an average time span of 6 days. Remaining 36% of patients progressed to IPPV with definitive airway. During study period, 4.2% of healthcare workers (HCW) got infected with COVID-19. Associated complications of NIPPV application were claustrophobia (13.8%), nasal crusting (6.9%), aspiration (6.1%) and barotrauma (0.7%). Conclusion: In carefully selected patients, use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation with the application of HME and viral/bacterial filters is an effective, preferable and safe modality of choice to provide respiratory support, thus obviating the need for IPPV.

We sought to detail the presence of PE, clinical, laboratory features, and outcomes of those with PE and CV19 compared to CV19 and no PE. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) studies undertaken at our hospital during the peak of the pandemic between 29/2-3/5/2020. We included all inpatients with positive CV19 swab or classical or probable features of CV19 on CTPA. All CTPAs were reviewed by certified radiologists. The patient's electronic health records were reviewed for clinical data. Results: Total 132 (45.9%) of CTPAs met inclusion criteria. Presence of PE was 31 (23.5%), with 13 (41.9%) being central, and 18 (58.1%) peripheral. Men (70.4%, P0.04) and white ethnicity (58.1%, P0.03) were significantly associated with PE. No association was seen between CTPA radiographic severity of CV19 and presence of PE. Thromboprophylaxis was administered to 73.2% of the cohort prior to CTPA, no association (P0.29) between administration and diagnosed PE. No difference in vital observations in the 24hrs prior to CTPA as detected. Median Ddimer and Troponin T were significantly elevated (P&lt;0.01) in those with PE. Median Ddimer was 1050ng/mL (585-2047) in PE compared to 403ng/mL (242-664) in those without. Troponin T level was 3 times higher (25ng/L (11-51) vs 8ng/L (6-18)) in those with PE. No association was detected for other laboratory tests including: white blood cells and differential, ferritin, c-reactive protein, and brain naturetic peptide. Critical illness (composite in-hospital mortality, ITU or respiratory HDU admission, transfer to tertiary centre) occurred in 50.8% of the cohort, there was no difference (P0.9) between groups. No significant difference between in hospital mortality (PE 16.7% vs no PE 13%), ITU admission (PE 38.7% vs no PE 33.7%). Conclusion: Presence of PE is high in those infected with CV19 with males and white ethnicity at risk. Ddimer and Troponin T are useful indicators of PE in those with CV19 and significant elevations in deteriorating patients should prompt evaluation for PE. The significance of PE needs further research considering lack of difference in outcomes within our cohort.","Bennett, J.; White, A.; Bessame, K.; Cartwright, E.; Gulrez, A.; Raja, N.; Oseni, A.; Kotb, H.; O039,; Connor, S.; Rhodes, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,286,20

In the emergency setting new or available therapies to contrast the spread of COVID-19 are urgently needed. Elderly males, especially those affected by previous diseases or with comorbidities, are more prone to develop interstitial pneumonia that can deteriorate evolving to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) that require hospitalization in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Even children and young patients are not spared by SARS-CoV 2 infection, yet they seem to develop a milder form of disease. In this setting the immunomodulatory role of Vitamin D, should be further investigated. METHODS: We reviewed the literature about the immunomodulatory role of Vitamin D collecting data from the databases Medline and Embase. RESULTS: Vitamin D proved to interact both with the innate immune system, by activating Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or increasing the levels of cathelicidins and ß-defensins, and adaptive immune system, by reducing immunoglobulin secretion by plasma cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines production, thus modulating T cells function. Promising results have been extensively described as regards the supplementation of vitamin D in respiratory tract infections, autoimmune diseases and even pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we suggest that vitamin D supplementation might play a role in the prevention and/or treatment to SARS-CoV-2 infection disease, by modulating the immune response to the virus both in the adult and pediatric population.","Panfili, F M; Roversi, M; D039,; Argenio, P; Rossi, P; Cappa, M; Fintini, D",J. endocrinol. invest,286,14

Norm descriptors were obtained by calculating the norm index of the atomic distribution matrix, which was composed of atomic spatial distribution and atomic properties. These norm index-based QSAR models presented satisfactory results with R2 of 0.8549, 0.9162, 0.8335 and 0.8119 for 48, 96, 120 and 132 h, respectively. Validation results including cross validation, external validation, Y-randomized test and applicability domain analysis indicated that the proposed models were stable, robust and reliable.

METHOD: Six weeks after the beginning of the confinement period, an online 10- question survey was sent to all members of the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacists. A single response per hospital was requested. The survey included questions on the provision of remote pharmaceutical care prior to the onset of the health crisis, patient selection criteria, procedures for home delivery of medications and the means used to deliver them, the number of patients who benefited from telepharmacy, and the number of referrals made. Finally, respondents were asked whether a teleconsultation was carried out before sending patients their medication and whether these deliveries were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 39.3% (n = 185) of all the hospitals in the National Health System (covering all of Spain's autonomous regions) responded to the survey. Before the beginning of the crisis, 83.2% (n = 154) of hospital pharmacy services did not carry out remote pharmaceutical care activities that included telepharmacy with remote delivery of medication. During the study period, 119,972 patients were treated, with 134,142 deliveries of medication being completed. Most hospitals did not use patient selection criteria. A total of 30.2% of hospitals selected patients based on their personal circumstances. Home delivery and informed delivery (87%; 116,129 deliveries) was the option used in most cases. The means used to deliver the medication mainly included the use of external courier services (47.0%; 87 hospitals) or the hospital's own transport services (38.4%; 71 hospitals). As many as 87.6% of hospitals carried out teleconsultations prior to sending out medications and 59.6% recorded their telepharmacy activities in the hospital pharmacy appointments record. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of implementation of telepharmacy in outpatient care in Spain during the study period in the pandemic was high.

An attractive alternative to the use of transgenics or pesticides in agriculture is the use of a 'green' alternative known as RNAi, which involves the delivery of siRNAs that downregulate endogenous genes to confer resistance. However, siRNA is a molecule that is highly susceptible to enzymatic degradation and is difficult to deliver across the lignin-rich and multi-layered plant cell wall that poses the dominant physical barrier to biomolecule delivery in plants. We have demonstrated that DNA nanostructures can be utilized as a cargo carrier for direct siRNA delivery and gene silencing in mature plants. The size, shape, compactness and stiffness of the DNA nanostructure affect both internalization into plant cells and subsequent gene silencing efficiency. Herein, we provide a detailed protocol that can be readily adopted with standard biology benchtop equipment to generate geometrically optimized DNA nanostructures for transgene-free and force-independent siRNA delivery and gene silencing in mature plants. We further discuss how such DNA nanostructures can be rationally designed to efficiently enter plant cells and deliver cargoes to mature plants, and provide guidance for DNA nanostructure characterization, storage and use.

Methods: The study involved 91 patients applying with a medical history supportive of COVID-19 infection. According to the hospitalization criteria and diagnostic result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test certainty of the disease, three groups were created. Patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results were consisted of 31 hospitalized subjects. To assess the applicant psychological state, a specially developed questionnaire was used, as the presence and severities of the symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Results: Statistically, a significantly higher average level of depression and a higher incidence of anxiety were demonstrated among applicants in the Covid-19 pandemic (% 24 and % 44).

Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19. METHODS: We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in six continents. We included patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group. Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded. The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation). FINDINGS: 96â032 patients (mean age 53·8 years, 46·3% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14â888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81â144 patients were in the control group. 10â698 (11·1%) patients died in hospital. After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9·3%), hydroxychloroquine (18·0%; hazard ratio 1·335, 95% CI 1·223-1·457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23·8%; 1·447, 1·368-1·531), chloroquine (16·4%; 1·365, 1·218-1·531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22·2%; 1·368, 1·273-1·469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Compared with the control group (0·3%), hydroxychloroquine (6·1%; 2·369, 1·935-2·900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8·1%; 5·106, 4·106-5·983), chloroquine (4·3%; 3·561, 2·760-4·596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6·5%; 4·011, 3·344-4·812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation. INTERPRETATION: We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19. Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.

Results: In the main analysis, 103 patients receiving ACEi/ARB were compared with 173 patients receiving other regimens. Overall, 44 patients (15.94%) had an endpoint event. The risk probability of crude endpoints in the ACEi/ARB group (12.62%) was lower than that in the non-ACEi/ARB group (17.92%). After adjusting for confounding factors by inverse probability weighting, the results showed that the use of ACEi/ARB reduced the occurrence of end events by 47% [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.53;95% CI, 0.34-0.83]. Similar results were obtained in multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: In this retrospective study, among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, the use of ACEi/ARB is not associated with an increased risk of disease severity compared with patients without ACEi/ARB. The trends of beneficial effects of ACEi/ARB need to be further evaluated in randomized clinical trials.","Ma, J.; Shi, X. W.; Yu, J.; Lv, F. F.; Wu, J.; Sheng, X. Y.; Pan, Q. L.; Yang, J.

Current levels of both are estimated, for 10 year periods, using their lagged (own and cross) levels and eight other lagged variables. Population is affected by both human and natural amenities and employment by wages, patents, and other attributes of the workforce. This paper questions the conventional interpretation of the adjustment process by using geographically weighted regression (GWR) instead of standard linear (OLS, 2GLS) regression. Here the various estimates are all local, so the long-run equilibrium solutions for the adjustment process vary over space. Convergence no longer indicates a stable universal solution but instead involves a mix of stable and unstable local solutions. Local sustainability becomes an issue when making projections because employment can quickly lead or lag population in some metropolitan labor markets.","Mulligan, Gordon F.; Carruthers, John I.",Urban Science,286,20

METHODS: In this prospective, observational, and comparative study, 40 acromegaly patients and 40 healthy control participants were included. Serum IGF-1 levels and disease duration of all patients were noted. Macular layers and angiography scanning was performed with a Zeiss Cirrus 5000 OCTA system. Macular thickness, RNFL, and GC-IPL values were obtained. For central vessel and perfusion density, central 6 mm was obtained and was evaluated by dividing into three groups (inner, outer, full). FAZ parameters were evaluated dividing into three groups (area, perimeter, circularity index). Analysis of the data was performed with the SPSS for Windows. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the patient group and the control group in terms of age, gender, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spherical equivalent (SE), intraocular pressure (IOP), and axial length (AL). The mean follow-up period after diagnosis was 11.0 ± 5.5 years. Central and mean macular thicknesses were also significantly higher in the acromegaly group (p < 0.05). Superior, inferior, and average RNFL thicknesses were also significantly thinner in the acromegaly group (p < 0.05). When OCTA parameters were compared between groups, there was a significant decrease in central vessel density (CVD) and central perfusion density (CPD) values in all regions in acromegaly group compared with controls (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings with OCTA show that acromegaly causes a significant capillary network decrease according to the healthy subjects.","Akay, Fahrettin; Akmaz, Berkay; Isik, Mehmed Ugur; Güven, Yusuf Ziya; Örük, Güzide Gonca",,286,23

This study sought to determine whether obesity is a risk factor for mortality among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The study was a retrospective cohort that included patients with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 18, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 238 patients were included; 218 patients (91.6%) were African American, 113 (47.5%) were male, and the mean age was 58.5 years. Of the included patients, 146 (61.3%) had obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2 ), of which 63 (26.5%), 29 (12.2%), and 54 (22.7%) had class 1, 2, and 3 obesity, respectively. Obesity was identified as a predictor for mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.7 [1.1-2.8], P = 0.016), as was male gender (OR 5.2 [1.6-16.5], P = 0.01) and older age (OR 3.6 [2.0-6.3], P < 0.0005).

BACKGROUND: During pandemic process, nurses reported to experience stress due to a very high risk of being infected and hard work. METHOD: A descriptive study. The sample of the study consisted of 169 emergency nurses. To collect data, a personal information form was used together with the Perceived Stress Scale. RESULTS: The factors that significantly affect the perceived stress score of emergency nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic included applying respiratory isolation, changing the way of life, not being able to access protective equipment, insufficient nurses in the unit and thinking that COVID-19 will be transmitted to oneself. CONCLUSION: Nearly half of the emergency nurses perceived stress above average during pandemic, and their working conditions affected this situation. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Meeting physiological needs and applying psychological guidance and counselling interventions in the stress management of emergency nurses may contribute to the reduction of their stress levels. Effective infection control, reducing workload, increasing the number of nurses and strengthening the coping mechanisms can minimize the perceived stress level of emergency nurses.","Çinar, Derya; Kiliç Akça, Nazan; Zorba Bahçeli, Pinar; Bag, Yasar",J. nurs. manag,286,5

Part of this canon involves the idea that virulence and free-living survival (a key component of transmission) may have different relationships in different host-parasite systems. Most examinations of the evolution of virulence-transmission relationships-Theoretical or empirical in nature-Tend to focus on the evolution of virulence, with transmission being a secondary consideration. Even within transmission studies, the focus on free-living survival is a smaller subset, though recent studies have examined its importance in the ecology of infectious diseases. Few studies have examined the epidemic-scale consequences of variation in survival across different virulence-survival relationships. In this study, we utilize a mathematical model motivated by aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) natural history to investigate how evolutionary changes in survival may influence several aspects of disease dynamics at the epidemiological scale. Across virulence-survival relationships (where these traits are either positively or negatively correlated), we found that small changes (5% above and below the nominal value) in survival can have a meaningful effect on certain outbreak features, including R0, and on the size of the infectious peak in the population. These results highlight the importance of properly understanding the mechanistic relationship between virulence and parasite survival, as the evolution of increased survival across different relationships with virulence may have considerably different epidemiological signatures.","Gomez, Lourdes M; Meszaros, Victor A; Turner, Wendy C; Ogbunugafor, C Brandon",Viruses,286,14

The cause of these symptoms is unclear, though they likely originate in subtle damage to alveolar septa or vasculature. Here, we present the case of a patient with persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms who was evaluated with hyperpolarized xenon-129 MRI methods, which are sensitive to both ventilation and exchange in both non-specific tissue-plasma and red-blood-cell bound compartments in the lungs. Case: A 58-year-old never-smoker female patient was diagnosed COVID-19 positive in August 2020. She continued to experience nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, pins-and-needles in the feet, dyspnea, and daily productive cough (green, non-bloody sputum). Chest x-ray showed clear lungs without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The subject underwent xenon-129 MR imaging on December 11, 2020 using a multi-breath scheme, in which sets of 6 ad libitum breaths containing 50mL of hyperpolarized xenon-129 (balance room air) were followed by four breaths of room air, and that 10-breath sequence was repeated until the polarized xenon-129 gas supply was exhausted. As shown in Figure 1, ventilated lung volumes are visually patchy, with heterogeneity corresponding to lobar structures or segmental and subsegmental volumes that are likely fed by airways with varying degrees of blockage. This is consistent with the persistent sputum production experienced by the patient. Further, saturation pulses at the frequency of hemoglobin-bound and tissue-plasma xenon-129 resonances selectively destroy signal in their respective compartments, which is subsequently exchanged to the gas phase. Compared to a healthy volunteer, the fractional depolarization achieved when applying identical saturation pulses is reduced by an average of approximately 40% in the patient. The response to saturation pulses also exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity. Discussion: Although a single case study is unable to determine the origin of alterations seen in a recovered COVID-19 patient, these changes are consistent with an overall reduction in the rate of gas exchange into dissolved compartments, as well as with a somewhat heterogeneous pattern of ventilation characteristic of mild obstructive disease. Further studies will be required to determine if these changes are associated with severe or persistent morbidity, and if correspondence to an age-matched healthy cohort increases as recovery continues.","Ruppert, K.; Kadlecek, S.; Amzajerdian, F.; Xin, Y.; Hamedani, H.; Loza, L.; Achekzai, T.

This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser and diode laser in the reduction of the turbinate size. Methods: This randomized controlled trial included 209 patients with ITH. Pre-operative symptoms were assessed based on the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) score. Diagnostic nasal endoscopy was done to rule out other nasal sinuses. Nasal mucociliary clearance was measured by saccharin transit time (STT). Postoperatively, the NOSE score, STT and complications were assessed at days one and two, at one week, one month and three months. Results: Of the 209 patients analyzed at day one, the median NOSE score was 50 in the diode group and 40 in the KTP group, and at three months, 15 in the diode group and five in the KTP group. KTP laser showed a 93 per cent improvement in the NOSE score as compared to 77 per cent improvement shown by diode laser group. Among the intra-operative complications, of the 104 patients in the diode group, 6.73 per cent had burning sensation and 91.43 per cent had bleeding, and of 105 patients in the KTP group, 54.29 per cent had burning sensation and 36.54 per cent had bleeding. Among the post-operative complications in the KTP group, 32 and 34 per cent had bloody nasal discharge on days one and two, compared to 12 and 14 per cent in diode group. Crusting was present in 61 and 49 per cent on days one and two in KTP group as compared to 9 and 15 per cent in diode group, respectively. In the KTP group 30 per cent had synechiae as compared to 10 per cent in diode group. Interpretation & conclusions: KTP laser was more efficacious than diode laser in improving the NOSE scores but with slightly increased rate of complications in early post-operative period.

One idea that has garnered considerable attention, particularly on social media and in free open access medicine is the notion that lung injury due to COVID-19 is more similar to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Drawing on this concept, it has also been proposed that treatments typically employed in the management of HAPE and other forms of acute altitude illness, pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide, should be considered for COVID-19. Despite some similarities in clinical features between the two entities, such as hypoxemia, radiographic opacities and altered lung compliance, the pathophysiological mechanisms of HAPE and lung injury due to COVID-19 are fundamentally different and the entities cannot be viewed as equivalent. While of high utility in the management of HAPE and acute mountain sickness, systemically delivered pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19, as they carry the risk of multiple adverse consequences including worsened ventilation-perfusion matching, impaired carbon dioxide transport, systemic hypotension and increased work of breathing.","Luks, Andrew M; Swenson, Erik R",Ann.

Timely access to patients’ current resuscitation wishes, or “code status,” should be a key metric of electronic health records (EHR). We sought to determine what percentage of a cohort of patients with end-stage disease who present to the emergency department (ED) have accessible, code status documents, and for those who do, how quickly can this documentation be retrieved. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study of ED patients with end-stage disease (eg, palliative care, metastatic malignancy, home oxygen, dialysis) conducted during purposefully sampled random accrual times we performed a standardized, timed review of available health records, including accompanying transfer documents. We also interviewed consenting patients and substitute decision makers to compare available code status documents to their current wishes. RESULTS: Code status documentation was unavailable within 15 minutes of ED arrival in most cases (54/85, or 63%). Retrieval time was under five minutes in the rest, especially when “one click deep” in the EHR. When interviewed, 20/32 (63%) expressed “do not resuscitate” wishes, 10 of whom had no supporting documentation. Patients from assisted-living (odds ratio [OR] 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7–26) and long-term care facilities (OR 13; 95% CI, 2.5–65) were more likely to have a documented code status available compared to those living in the community. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients with end-stage disease, including half of those who would not wish resuscitation from cardiorespiratory arrest, did not have code status documents readily available upon arrival to our tertiary care ED. Patients living in the community with advanced disease may be at higher risk for unwanted resuscitative efforts should they present to hospital in extremis. While easily retrievable code status documentation within the EHR shows promise, its accuracy and validity remain important considerations.","Russell, Evan; Hall, Andrew K.; McKaigney, Conor; Goldie, Craig; Harle, Ingrid; Sivilotti, Marco L.A.",West J Emerg Med,286,24

Early identification of PED virus (PEDV)-infected herd through surveillance or monitoring strategies is necessary for mass control of PED. However, a common working diagnosis system involves identifying PEDV-infected animals individually, which is a costly and time-consuming approach. Given the above information, the thrusts of this study were to develop a real-time fluorescent reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RtF-RT-LAMP) assay and establish a pooled testing system using faecal sample to identify PEDV-infected herd. RESULTS: In this study, we developed an accurate, rapid, cost-effective, and simple RtF- RT-LAMP assay for detecting the PEDV genome targeting M gene. The pooled testing system using the RtF-RT-LAMP assay was optimized such that a pool of at least 15 individual faecal samples could be analysed. CONCLUSIONS: The developed RtF-RT-LAMP assay in our study could support the design and implementation of large-scaled epidemiological surveys as well as active surveillance and monitoring programs for effective control of PED.

Therefore, this qualitative study was conducted to examine and explain these social consequences and their impact on the social capital of Iran during the COVID-19 outbreak. Using a content analysis approach, nine experts participated in semistructured, in-depth interviews. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and analyzed using Lundman and Graneheim's method. The social impacts of COVID-19 can be summarized into six categories and 32 subcategories. Three positive-negative categories emerged from the data analysis: “formation of new patterns of social communications; formation of new patterns of behavior; creation of economic changes.” Three entirely negative categories included “creating a climate of distrust; disruption of cultural, social, and religious values; psychosocial disorders.” Overall, most findings (27 out of 32 subcategories) indicated the destructive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on social capital. Therefore, this raises concerns about social capital endangerment in Iran. However, positive social impacts can guide policies that strengthen social action and improve social capital.","Motamed-Jahromi, Mohadeseh; Kaveh, Mohammad Hossein",Interdiscip Perspect Infect Dis,286,3

Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to identify the volatile constituents present, and the antioxidant capacity of EOs was determined using diphenylpicryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays. For E. patrisii, germacrene D (20.03%), bicyclogermacrene (11.82%), and (E)-caryophyllene (11.04%) were identified as the major constituents of the EOs extracted from specimen A, whereas specimen B primarily comprised γ-elemene (25.89%), germacrene B (8.11%), and (E)-caryophyllene (10.76%). The EOs of E. punicifolia specimen A contained β-Elemene (25.12%), (E)-caryophyllene (13.11%), and bicyclogermacrene (9.88%), while specimen B was composed of (E)-caryophyllene (11.47%), bicyclogermacrene (5.86%), β-pinene (5.86%), and γ-muurolene (5.55%). The specimen A of M. tomentosa was characterized by γ-elemene (12.52%), germacrene D (11.45%), and (E)-caryophyllene (10.22%), while specimen B contained spathulenol (40.70%), α-zingiberene (9.58%), and γ-elemene (6.89%). Additionally, the chemical composition of the EOs was qualitatively and quantitatively affected by the collection period.

This study was designed to assess the beneficial effects of post-treatment of oroxylin A (OroA), a flavonoid, in ameliorating lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced lung inflammation and fatality. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rats were injected with LPS (10 mg/kg, iv) to induce ALI, and OroA was given (15 mg/kg, iv) 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS challenge. Twenty four hrs after LPS challenge, biochemical changes in the blood and lung tissues, and morphological/histological alterations in the lung associated with inflammation and injury were examined. Therapeutic effect of OroA was assessed by measuring the survival rate in endotoxemic mice. KEY RESULTS: LPS (10 mg/kg, iv) significantly altered WBC counts, elevated plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and nitric oxide (NO), increased pulmonary edema, thickened alveolar septa, and decreased survival rate. These changes were ameliorated by OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) administered 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS challenge. This post-treatment also significantly attenuated LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in lung tissues. Furthermore, post-treatment with OroA (60 mg/kg, ip) administered 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS challenge in mice significantly increased survival rate. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATION: OroA administered after induction of ALI by LPS significantly prevent and revere lung tissues injuries with increased survival rate. Positive post-treatment effects of OroA suggest that OroA is a potentially useful candidate for managing lung inflammation in LPS-induced endotoxemia and septic shock.","Tseng, Tzu-Ling; Chen, Mei-Fang; Tsai, Ming-Jen; Hsu, Yung-Hsiang; Chen, Chin-Piao; Lee, Tony J.

As the medical community seeks better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of COVID-19, several theories have been proposed. One widely shared theory suggests that SARS-CoV-2 proteins directly interact with human hemoglobin (Hb) and facilitate removal of iron from the heme prosthetic group, leading to the loss of functional hemoglobin and accumulation of iron. Herein, we refute this theory. We compared clinical data from 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients to 21 non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patient controls, generating hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curves from venous blood gases. This curve generated from the COVID-19 cohort matched the idealized oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve well (Pearson correlation R2=0.97, P<0.0001; a coefficient of variation of the root-mean-square deviation [CV(RMSD)] =7.3%). We further analyzed hemoglobin, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, iron, ferritin, and haptoglobin levels. For all analyzed parameters, patients with COVID-19 had similar levels compared to patients with ARDS without COVID-19. These results indicate that patients with COVID-19 do not exhibit any hemolytic anemia or a shift in the normal hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve. We therefore conclude that COVID-19 does not impact oxygen delivery through a mechanism involving red cell hemolysis and subsequent removal of iron from the heme prosthetic group in hemoglobin.","DeMartino, Anthony W.; Rose, Jason J.; Amdahl, Matthew B.; Dent, Matthew R.; Shah, Faraaz A.; Bain, William; McVerry, Bryan J.; Kitsios, Georgios D.; Tejero, Jesús; Gladwin, Mark T.",Haematologica,286,1

The need for renal replacement therapies (RRTs) in those with the most severe forms of AKI is considerable and risks overwhelming health‐care systems at the peak of a surge. We detail the challenges and considerations involved in the preparation of a disaster response plan in situations such as the COVID‐19 pandemic, which dramatically increase demand for nephrology services. Taking careful inventory of all aspects of an RRT program (personnel, consumables, and machines) before a surge in RRT arises and developing disaster contingency protocol anticoagulation and for shared RRT models when absolutely necessary are paramount to a successful response to such a disaster.","Stevens, Jacob S.; Velez, Juan Carlos Q.; Mohan, Sumit",Semin Dial,286,20

Given their central role in cell life, compartmentalization and mechanisms allowing their maintenance despite continuous crosstalk among different organelles have been deeply investigated over the past years. Here, we review the multiple functions exerted by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery in driving membrane remodeling and fission, as well as in repairing physiological and pathological membrane damages. In this way, ESCRT machinery enables different fundamental cellular processes, such as cell cytokinesis, biogenesis of organelles and vesicles, maintenance of nuclear–cytoplasmic compartmentalization, endolysosomal activity. Furthermore, we discuss some examples of how viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, have evolved to hijack the ESCRT machinery or part of it to execute/optimize their replication cycle/infection. A special emphasis is given to the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) interaction with the ESCRT proteins, considering the peculiarities of this interplay and the need for HSV-1 to cross both the nuclear-cytoplasmic and the cytoplasmic-extracellular environment compartmentalization to egress from infected cells.","Calistri, Arianna; Reale, Alberto; Palù, Giorgio; Parolin, Cristina",Cells,286,18

Significant systemic constraints make hospitals reluctant partners in preparedness and generate ineffective responses. Such a condition has been highlighted by the antiterrorism training and preparedness programs over the past few years. The results of numerous such exercises and actual responses across the United States indicate a list of pitfalls—such as communications, hospital security, and hospital staff management—which are related to the inherent system limitations that hinder the effective disaster operations in hospitals. Hospitals are required to have and exercise emergency-preparedness plans. An all-hazard approach can allow for preparedness and a measured, flexible response to a variety of potential incidents. Generally, plans may contain annexes for specific hazards, but an all-hazard plan should obviate a separate plan for each hazard—for example, an earthquake plan and a terrorism plan.","Rubin, Jeffrey N.",Hospital Preparation for Bioterror,286,16

Non-classical ACE2 is one of two types of ACE2 that has a protective effect on vascular and respiratory cells. RAS modulators like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are among the first-line treatment for hypertensive patients. An upregulation in ACE2 levels with RAS modulators was observed in few preclinical studies, which raised concerns regarding possible increased infectivity among patients treated with RAS modulators.Method: For shortlisting the outcome effects, open-ended, English-restricted databases, published literature, and various clinical studies performed utilizing RAS modulators in COVID 19 patients were considered. Conclusion: Current evidence reveals no increased risk of COVID-19 infection among hypertensive patients on ACEIs/ARBs compared to other antihypertensive medications. Several studies have demonstrated no detrimental effects of RAS modulators on clinical severity, hospital/intensive care unit stay, ventilation and mortality. Hence, we can conclude that neither ARBs nor ACEIs treatment will cause any side effects or undesirable interactions in COVID-19 infected hypertensive patients.","Shylesh C M, Shakhi; V S, Arya; S K, Kanthlal; P, Uma Devi",Clinical and experimental hypertension,286,21

Methods: We analyzed laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case data for 150 upper tier local authorities, from the period from January 30 to May 6, 2020, as reported by Public Health England. Using methods suitable for time-series data, we identified clusters of local authorities with distinct trajectories of daily cases, after adjusting for population size. We then tested for differences in sociodemographic, economic, and health disparity factors between these clusters. Results: Two clusters of local authorities were identified: a higher case trajectory that rose faster over time to reach higher peak infection levels, and a lower case trajectory cluster that emerged more slowly, and had a lower peak. The higher case trajectory cluster (79 local authorities) had higher population density (p<0.001), higher proportion of Black and Asian residents (p=0.03; p=0.02), higher multiple deprivation scores (p<0.001), a lower proportions of older adults (p=0.005), and higher preventable mortality rates (p=0.03). Local authorities with higher proportions of Black residents were more likely to belong to the high case trajectory cluster, even after adjusting for population density, deprivation, proportion of older adults and preventable mortality (p=0.04). Conclusion: Areas belonging to the trajectory with significantly higher COVID-19 case burden were more deprived, and had higher proportions of ethnic minority residents. A higher proportion of Black residents in regions belonging to the high trajectory cluster was not fully explained by differences in population density, deprivation, and other overall health disparities between the clusters.","Liu, S.

The arrivals occur according to a batch Markovian point process and the services are generally distributed. The customers arriving after the service initiation cannot enter the ongoing service. The service time is independent on the batch size. First, we employ the classical embedded Markov renewal process approach to study the model. Secondly, under the assumption that the services are of phase type, we study the model as a continuous-time Markov chain whose generator has a very special structure. Using matrix-analytic methods we study the model in steady-state and discuss some special cases of the model as well as representative numerical examples covering a wide range of service time distributions such as constant, uniform, Weibull, and phase type.","Chakravarthy, Srinivas R.; Shruti; Rumyantsev, Alexander",Methodol Comput Appl Probab,286,25

Disrupted mucus production is a cardinal feature of chronic respiratory diseases but how this alteration affect interactions between mucins and pathogens is complex and poorly understood. Here, we identify a central and unexpected role for the major airway mucin MUC5AC in pathogenesis of virus-induced exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Virus induction of MUC5AC is augmented in COPD compared to healthy subjects, is enhanced in frequent exacerbators and correlates with inflammation, symptom severity and secondary bacterial infection during exacerbation. MUC5AC is functionally related to inflammation as MUC5AC-deficient (Muc5ac-/-) mice had attenuated rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation whilst exogenous MUC5AC glycoprotein administration augmented virus-induced inflammatory responses and bacterial load. Mechanistically, MUC5AC-augmentation of rhinovirus-induced inflammation occurred through release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Therapeutic suppression of virus-induced MUC5AC release using an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor ameliorated exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses in a mouse COPD exacerbation model. Collectively, these studies demonstrate previously unrecognised pro-inflammatory effects of MUC5AC during infection and thus highlight a key unforeseen role in driving COPD exacerbation severity.","Singanayagam, Aran; Footitt, Joseph; Kasdorf, Benjamin T; Marczynski, Matthias; Cross, Michael T; Finney, Lydia J; Trujillo Torralbo, Maria-Belen; Calderazzo, Maria; Zhu, Jie; Aniscenko, Julia; Clarke, Thomas B; Molyneaux, Philip L; Bartlett, Nathan W; Moffatt, Miriam F; Cookson, William O; Wedzicha, Jadwiga; Evans, Christopher M; Lieleg, Oliver; Mallia, Patrick; Johnston, Sebastian L",bioRxiv,286,16

The influence of such formulaic disease modelling has pervaded public health policy and practice during the Covid-19 pandemic. The critical vocabulary of epidemiology, and now popular debate, thus includes R(0), the basic reproduction number of the virus, ‘flattening the curve’, and epidemic ‘waves’. How did this happen? What are the consequences of framing and foreseeing the pandemic in these modes? Focusing on historical and contemporary disease responses, primarily in Britain, I explore the emergence of statistical modelling as a ‘crisis technology’, a reductive mechanism for making rapid decisions or judgments under uncertain biological constraint. I consider how Covid-19 might be configured or assembled otherwise, constituted as a more heterogeneous object of knowledge, a different and more encompassing moment of truth – not simply as a measured telos directing us to a new normal. Drawing on earlier critical engagements with the AIDS pandemic, inquiries into how to have ‘theory’ and ‘promiscuity’ in a crisis, I seek to open up a space for greater ecological, sociological, and cultural complexity in the biopolitics of modelling, thereby attempting to validate a role for critique in the Covid-19 crisis.","Anderson, Warwick",Soc Stud Sci,286,26
