1792,External validation of scores proposed for estimation of survival probability of patients with severe adult respiratory distress syndrome undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy: a retrospective study,2015-04-07,"INTRODUCTION: This study was designed as an external validation of the recently proposed Predicting Death for Severe ARDS on V-V ECMO (PRESERVE) score, The respiratory extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survival prediction (RESP) score and a scoring system developed for externally retrieved patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at our institution. All scores are proposed for the estimation of survival probability after ECMO treatment for severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. METHODS: Data from 51 patients (2008 to 2013) were analyzed in this retrospective single-center study. A calculation of an adapted PRESERVE score, the RESP score as well as the score developed for externally retrieved ECMO patients was performed. RESULTS: Seventy one percent of patients received veno-venous (v-v) and 29% venous-arterial (v-a) ECMO support during the study period. Overall survival at 6 months was 55%, with a 61% survival rate for v-v cannulated patients and a 40% survival rate for v-a cannulated patients. The PRESERVE score discriminated survivors and non-survivors with an area under the curve of 0.67 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.82, P = 0.03). Analyzing survival prediction according to cannulation modus, the PRESERVE score and the RESP score significantly predicted survival for patients on v-v ECMO with an area under the curve of 0.75 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.92, P = 0.01) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.95, P = 0.035), respectively, while the scoring system developed for externally retrieved ECMO patients failed to predict survival in our study population. All scores failed to predict mortality for patients on v-a ECMO. CONCLUSION: Our single-center validation confirms that the proposed PRESERVE and RESP score predict survival for patients treated with v-v ECMO for severe adult respiratory distress syndrome.

5757,Associations between ventilator settings during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory hypoxemia and outcome in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a pooled individual patient data analysis: Mechanical ventilation during ECMO,2016-09-01,"Objectives: To investigate the value of extracorporeal circulatory life support (ECLS) in paediatric patients with severe Bordetella pertussis infection. Design: Single case report and a review of the ECLS database. Setting: Tertiary referral hospital paediatric intensive care unit. Patients and participants: A single case report of an infant with B. pertussis infection is described. Despite receiving ECLS, this infant died from overwhelming cardiac and cerebral insults. Outcome for children receiving ECLS registered on the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization database is reviewed. Measurements and results: The mortality of infants receiving ECLS for B. pertussis infection is high, with only 5 survivors reported among 22 registered cases. The majority of nonsurvivors had evidence of circulatory collapse in addition to severe respiratory failure, and these patients commonly died of hypoxic-ischaemic cerebral insult. These data suggest the existence of a subgroup of patients with respiratory failure only, who may benefit from ECLS, and a larger subgroup who suffer ischaemic cardiac and cerebral insults which are unlikely to be improved by ECLS. Conclusions: The value of ECLS in patients with B. pertussis infection who present with major cardiac dysfunction is questionable. Such patients almost invariably have a poor outcome despite maximal therapy.","Williams, G. D.; Numa, A.; Sokol, J.; Tobias, V.; Duffy, B.

5787,Outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and brought to a referral center,2013-10-30,"SEVERAL syngens or breeding groups of Paramecium aurelia contain endosymbionts which may result in the development of the killer trait(1). The symbionts are of different morphological types and it has been suggested that these are non-randomly distributed between syngens(2). Experiments involving crosses between paramecia with and without symbionts showed that each endosymbiont required a specific nuclear gene for its maintenance. A single gene controlled the presence or absence of endosymbionts as shown by segregation in the F(2) generation. The pattern of loss of symbionts in some of those F(2) clones varies, generally extending over a number of asexual fissions which for different endosymbionts can be from two to over sixty. Infection experiments also demonstrate the requirement for a specific gene. Infection of endosymbionts from homogenates or purified preparations occurs via the medium but only into particular cells possessing a specific gene(1,3). Finally, some endosymbionts growing in vitro retain their infectivity into certain paramecia (author's laboratory).","GIBSON, I.",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095021/,322
5805,Blood ferritin and isoferritins measurements may be helpful in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients,2002-05-09,"PURPOSE: To analyze the impact on patient outcome of ventilator-associated events (VAEs) as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2008, 2013, and the correlation with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheobronchitis (VAT). METHODS: This was a prospective, observational, multicenter, international study conducted at 13 intensive care units (ICUs); thirty consecutive adults mechanically ventilated for ≥ 48 h per site were eligible, with daily follow-up being recorded in a collaborative web database; VAEs were assessed using the 2013 CDC classification and its 2015 update. RESULTS: A total of 2856 ventilator days in 244 patients were analyzed, identifying 33 VAP and 51 VAT episodes; 30-day ICU mortality was significantly higher (42.8 vs. 19.6%, p < 0.007) in patients with VAP than in those with VAT. According to the 2013 CDC definitions, 117 VAEs were identified: 113 (96%) were infection-related ventilator-associated complication-plus (IVAC-plus), while possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (PVAP) was found in 64 (56.6%) of them. VAE increased the number of ventilator days and prolonged ICU and hospital LOS (by 5, 11, and 12 days, respectively), with a trend towards increased 30-day mortality (43 vs 28%, p = 0.06). Most episodes (26, 55%) classified as IVAC-plus without PVAP criteria were due to atelectasis. PVAP significantly increased (p < 0.05) ventilator days as well as ICU and hospital LOS (by 10.5, 14, and 13 days, respectively). Only 24 (72.7%) of VAP and 15 (29.4%) of VAT episodes met IVAC-plus criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory infections (mainly VAT) were the most common complication. VAE algorithms only identified events with surrogates of severe oxygenation deterioration. As a consequence, IVAC definitions missed one fourth of the episodes of VAP and three fourths of the episodes of VAT. Identifying VAT (often missed by IVAC-plus criteria) is important, as VAP and VAT have different impacts on mortality.

5875,An increased alveolar CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory cell ratio in acute respiratory distress syndrome is associated with increased 30-day mortality,2013-08-16,"608 patients admitted to a general Intensive Care Unit (ICU) over a 30 month period were analyzed according to the Apache II Severity of Disease Classification System on day one of admission. Hospital outcome details were available on 583 patients in the series. The mean Apache II scores for survivors (396) and non-survivors (187) were 13 (SD 7) and 24 (SD 9), and their Risk of Death were 16 (SD 16) and 47 (SD 27) respectively (p(0.001 for both). The majority of deaths (75%: 141/187) in our series came from those with chronic ill health (55%: 103/187), of whom 37% (38/103) were in endstage disease, and those with “old” trauma (18%: 34/187) often with incipient sepsis transferred from other hospitals after a mean delay of 9 days. Our higher than predicted mortality (mortality ratio 1.2) in comparison with centres in the United States of America (US) may be partly explained by the high proportion of our population from these unfavourable groups, by our use of the best Glasgow Coma Scale in the first 24 h following admission, and the major differences between our patient population and that of the US upon which the Apache II was based. The presence of these large unfavourable groups indicates a change in our admission policy is warranted.","Jacobs, S.; Chang, R. W.

5901,Exogenous surfactant therapy for acute respiratory distress in infancy,1996,"PURPOSE: To describe the technical challenges, efficacy, complications and maternal and infant outcomes associated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in pregnant or postpartum patients during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. METHODS: Twelve critically ill pregnant and postpartum women were included in this retrospective observational study on the application of ECMO for the treatment of severe ARDS refractory to standard treatment. The study was conducted at seven tertiary hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. RESULTS: Of the 12 patients treated with ECMO, 7 (58%) were pregnant and 5 (42%) were postpartum. Their median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 29 (26–33) years, 6 (50%) were obese. Two patients were initially treated with veno-arterial (VA) ECMO. All others received veno-venous (VV) ECMO with one or two drainage cannulae. ECMO circuit-related complications were rare, circuit change was needed in only two cases and there was no sudden circuit failure. On the other hand, bleeding was common, leading to relatively large volumes of packed red blood cell transfusion (median [IQR] volume transfused was 3,499 [1,451–4,874] ml) and was the main cause of death (three cases). Eight (66%) patients survived to discharge and seven were ambulant, with normal oxygen saturations. The survival rate of infants whose mothers received ECMO was 71% and surviving infants were discharged home with no sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ECMO for severe ARDS in pregnant and postpartum women was associated with a 66% survival rate. The most common cause of death was bleeding. Infants delivered of mothers who had received ECMO had a 71% survival rate and, like their mothers, had no permanent sequelae at hospital discharge.

This might pave the way, not only for academia–practitioner gap mitigation but also for a better human-centric understanding of utilising the technologically disruptive marketing trends, rather making them a foe. The plethora of marketing issues and challenges were distilled into 45 segments, and a detailed tabulation of the significant ones has been depicted for analysis and discussion. Furthermore, the conceptually thick five literary containers were developed, by coupling the constructs as per similarity in their categorical nature and connections. The ‘ethical issues and legality’ was identified as on the top, which provided literary comprehension and managerial implication for marketing analytics conceptualisation in the fourth industrial revolution era.","Dar, Imran Bashir; Khan, Muhammad Bashir; Khan, Abdul Zahid; Mujtaba, Bahaudin G.",J Market Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8243052/,322

Obesity levels have reached a sustained high, whereby several percent of a country's population would qualify for surgery based upon current national guidelines. Worldwide, the provision of surgery is highly variable and to treat all the affected population, it would require at least a 100-fold increase in the provision of services. This has important cost and commissioning implications for health-care planners. Reliable level 1 evidence of the long-term effects of obesity surgery is still lacking, and the long-term complication profiles and re-operation rates unclear, which could have significant impact on health-care systems in the future. The chronic disease management of obesity in a population must be integrated with education and prevention and the brief intervention of weight loss surgery and the management of its sequelae, to prevent significant future morbidity and mortality.","Hopkins, James Charles; Welbourn, Richard",Current obesity reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-015-0165-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26627491/,322

However, so far, the exact profiles of the temporal modes are not known, which makes it difficult to achieve mode selection and demultiplexing. Here, we report a novel method that measures directly the exact form of the temporal modes. This, in turn, enables us to make mode-orthogonal homodyne detection with mode-matched local oscillators. We apply the method to a pulse-pumped, specially engineered fiber parametric amplifier and demonstrate temporally multiplexed multidimensional quantum entanglement of continuous variables in telecom wavelength. The temporal mode characterization technique can be generalized to other pulse-excited systems to find their eigenmodes for multiplexing in the temporal domain.","Huo, Nan; Liu, Yuhong; Li, Jiamin; Cui, Liang; Chen, Xin; Palivela, Rithwik; Xie, Tianqi; Li, Xiaoying; Ou, Z Y",Physical review letters,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.124.213603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530692/,322

Previous research has suggested its potentially beneficial effects on diabetic nephropathies. However, its effects and protective mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a preclinical systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and potential mechanisms of ASIV in reducing kidney damage in diabetes mellitus (DM) models. Studies were searched from nine databases until January 2020. A random-effects model was used to calculate combined standardised mean difference estimates and 95 % confidence intervals. Risk of bias of studies was assessed using the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation risk of bias tool 10-item checklist. RevMan 5.3 software was used for statistical analysis. Twenty-three studies involving 562 animals were included in the meta-analysis. Studies quality scores ranged from 2 to 5. The ASIV group induced a marked decrease in serum creatinine (P < 0.00001), blood urea nitrogen (P < 0.00001), 24-h urine protein (P < 0.00001) and pathological score (P < 0.001) compared with the control group. The determined potential mechanisms of ASIV action were relieving oxidative stress, delaying renal fibrosis, anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammatory action. We conclude that ASIV exerts renal protective effects in animals with DM through multiple signalling pathways.","Zhou, Xiao-Tao; Zou, Jun-Ju; Ao, Chun; Gong, Dao-Yin; Chen, Xian; Ma, Yue-Rong",Pharmacological research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942018/,322

METHODS A descriptive analysis of maternal mental health, coping, support, activities, lockdown consequences was conducted. Women living in the UK with an infant aged ≤12 months completed an online survey. Linear regression was used to identify predictors of maternal mental health and coping. RESULTS A majority of the 1329 participants reported feeling down (56%), lonely (59%), irritable (62%), and worried (71%) to some extent since lockdown began, but 70% felt able to cope. Support with her own health (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.004-0.235), contacting infant support groups (95% CI -0.003 to 0.252), and higher gestational age of the infant (95% CI 0.000-0.063) predicted better mental health. Travelling for work (95% CI -0.680 to -0.121), the impact of lockdown on the ability to afford food (95% CI -1.202 to -0.177), and having an income <£30,000 (95% CI -0.475 to -0.042) predicted poorer mental health. Support with her own health and more equal division of household chores were associated with better coping.

The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the type of anesthesia on the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with the Solitaire stent retriever, accounting for confounding factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS Four-hundred one patients with consecutive acute anterior circulation stroke treated with a Solitaire stent retriever were included in this prospective analysis. Outcome was assessed after 3 months by the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS One-hundred thirty-five patients (31%) underwent endovascular treatment with conscious sedation, and 266 patients (69%), with general anesthesia. Patients under general anesthesia had higher NIHSS scores on admission (17 versus 13, P < .001) and more internal carotid artery occlusions (44.6% versus 14.8%, P < .001) than patients under conscious sedation. Other baseline characteristics such as time from symptom onset to the start of endovascular treatment did not differ. Favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) was more frequent with conscious sedation (47.4% versus 32%; OR, 0.773; 95% CI, 0.646-0.925; P = .002) in univariable but not multivariable logistic regression analysis (P = .629). Mortality did not differ (P = .077). Independent predictors of outcome were age (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.933-0.969; P < .001), NIHSS score (OR, 0.894; 95% CI, 0.855-0.933; P < .001), time from symptom onset to the start of endovascular treatment (OR, 0.998; 95% CI, 0.996-0.999; P = .011), diabetes mellitus (OR, 0.544; 95% CI, 0.305-0.927; P = .04), and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (OR, 0.109; 95% CI, 0.028-0.428; P = .002).

Instrument crowding and diminished triangulation are limitations. This study evaluates a novel single-port surgical platform (NSP) designed to facilitate the transition from TL to LESS (TransEnterix SPIDER, Durham, NC). METHODS NSP and TL were compared using standardized dry lab tasks. Feasibility of NSP in gynecology was assessed using the porcine model. RESULTS Completion times with NSP were longer for ring transfer (P = .025) and trended longer for disc cutting (P = .074). Disc cutting accuracy was lower with NSP versus TL (P = .008). NSP operative times for hysterectomy, pelvic and para-aortic node dissection were 22.3, 13.3, and 26 minutes, respectively, without complications. Fatigue and lack of integrated bipolar cautery were limitations of NSP. CONCLUSION While application of NSP to gynecology appears feasible, lower performance when compared with TL underscores the need for caution when applying NSP to humans.","Knight, Jason; Tunitsky-Britton, Elena; Muffly, Tyler; Michener, Chad M; Escobar, Pedro F",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350611425506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22064489/,322

METHODS This retrospective study examined the effects of changing the model of inpatient diabetes consultations from a local, private endocrine practice to a full-time endocrine hospitalist on glycemic control, LOS, and 30-day readmission rates in a 267-bed community hospital. RESULTS Overall diabetes patient days for the hospital were similar pre- and post-intervention (20,191 vs 20,262); however, the volume of patients seen by IDMS increased significantly after changing models. Rates of hyperglycemia decreased both among patients seen by IDMS (53.8% to 42.5%, P < .0001) and those not consulted on by IDMS (33.2% to 29.9%; P < .0001). When examined over time, rates of hypoglycemia steadily decreased in the 24 months after dedicated IDMS initiation (P = .02); no such time effect was seen prior to IDMS (P = .34). LOS and 30DRR were not significantly different between IDMS models. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of an endocrine hospitalist-based IDMS at a community hospital was associated with significantly decreased hyperglycemia, while avoiding concurrent increases in hypoglycemia. Further studies are needed to investigate whether these effects are associated with improvements in clinical outcomes, patient or staff satisfaction scores, or total cost of care.","Demidowich, Andrew P; Batty, Kristine; Love, Teresa; Sokolinsky, Sam; Grubb, Lisa; Miller, Catherine; Raymond, Larry; Nazarian, Jeanette; Ahmed, M Shafeeq; Rotello, Leo; Zilbermint, Mihail",Journal of diabetes science and technology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1932296821993198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615858/,322

The overarching goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide the first comprehensive summary of the findings of published studies thus far describing COVID-19 lung imaging data in the pediatric population. METHODS A systematic literature search of PubMed was performed to identify studies assessing lung-imaging features of COVID-19 pediatric patients (0-18 years). A single-arm meta-analysis was conducted to obtain the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS A total of 29 articles (n=1026 children) based on chest CT images were included. The main results of this comprehensive analysis are as follows: (1) Over a third of pediatric patients with COVID-19 (35.7%, 95% CI: 27.5%-44%) had normal chest CT scans and only 27.7% (95% CI: 19.9%-35.6%) had bilateral lesions; (2) the most typical pediatric chest CT findings of COVID-19 were ground-glass opacities (GGO) (37.2%, 95% CI: 29.3%-45%) and the presence of consolidations or pneumonic infiltrates (22.3%, 95% CI: 17.8%-26.9%); (3) the lung imaging findings in children with COVID-19 were overall less frequent and less severe than in adult patients; and (4) typical lung imaging features of viral respiratory infections in the pediatric population such as increased perihilar markings and hyperinflation were not reported in children with COVID-19. CONCLUSION Chest CT manifestations in children with COVID-19 could potentially be used for early identification and prompt intervention in the pediatric population.

Nevertheless, cesarean section has a higher risk and might have more complications compared with natural delivery. A reasonable choice of delivery method is important for maternal and neonatal health. The incidence of complications after cesarean section for mothers and neonates during the second stage of labor significantly increases compared with planned cesarean section. During the second stage of labor, the fetal head is deep in the pelvic cavity. If a cesarean section is performed at this stage, it is prone to causing complications, including difficult delivery of the fetal head, delayed uterine incision, and massive hemorrhage, which seriously threaten the health of the mother and her neonate. For the first time, we report a case of cesarean section after complete opening of the uterine orifice, which led to almost mistakenly suturing the cervix to the uterus. This report will hopefully help surgeons anticipate such incidents during cesarean section in the future.","Zhan, Jun; Xing, Aiyun; Tan, Xi",The Journal of international medical research,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060521999522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730903/,322

We investigated the duration of hospital stay after endoscopy and the risk factors for prolonged hospital stay among outpatients. Methods We retrospectively studied consecutive patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy at the Toyoshima Endoscopy Clinic. We collected data on age, sex, body weight, midazolam and pethidine dosage, respiratory depression during endoscopy, and duration of hospital stay after endoscopy (scope out to check out). Risk factors for prolonged hospital stay (>100 minutes) were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results We enrolled 3,898 patients, including 3,517 (90.2%) patients tested under sedation and 381 (9.8%) patients tested without sedation. Overall, 442 (11.3%) patients had prolonged stay (>100 min). The mean time difference between sedation group and non-sedation group was 44.2 minutes for esophagogastroduodenoscopy and 39.1 minutes for colonoscopy. Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.025; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.014-1.036), female sex (OR, 1.657; 95% CI, 1.220-2.249), and midazolam dose (OR, 1.019; 95% CI, 1.013-1.026) were independently associated with prolonged hospital stay after esophagogastroduodenoscopy, with similar results for colonoscopy. Conclusions Old age, female sex, and midazolam dose were independent risk factors for prolonged hospital stay after endoscopy.","Nishizawa, Toshihiro; Yoshida, Shuntaro; Toyoshima, Osamu; Matsuno, Tatsuya; Irokawa, Masataka; Arano, Toru; Ebinuma, Hirotoshi; Suzuki, Hidekazu; Kanai, Takanori; Koike, Kazuhiko",Clinical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.5946/ce.2020.292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33721977/,322
132839,Early corticosteroids in severe influenza A/H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.,2011,"OBJECTIVES To determine the association of hyponatremia at presentation with clinical and imaging outcomes in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage. DESIGN Retrospective pooled analysis of prospectively collected data from 3,243 participants of the pilot and main phases of the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trials 1 and 2 (international, multicenter, open, blinded endpoint, randomized controlled trials designed to assess the effects of early intensive blood pressure lowering in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage). SETTING Clinical hospital sites in 21 countries. PATIENTS Patients with predominantly mild-moderate severity of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage within 6 hours of onset and elevated systolic blood pressure (150-220 mm Hg) were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS Patients were assigned to receive intensive (target systolic blood pressure, < 140 mm Hg within 1 hr) or guideline-recommended (target systolic blood pressure, < 180 mm Hg) blood pressure-lowering therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Presentation hyponatremia was defined as serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L. The primary outcome was death at 90 days. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association of hyponatremia with important clinical events. Of 3,002 patients with available data, 349 (12%) had hyponatremia. Hyponatremia was associated with death (18% vs 11%; multivariable-adjusted odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.28-2.57; p < 0.001) and larger baseline intracerebral hemorrhage volume (multivariable adjusted, p = 0.046) but not with baseline perihematomal edema volume nor with growth of intracerebral hemorrhage or perihematomal edema during the initial 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS Hyponatremia at presentation is associated with increased mortality in patients with predominantly deep and modest volume intracerebral hemorrhage through mechanisms that seem independent of growth in intracerebral hemorrhage or perihematomal edema.","Carcel, Cheryl; Sato, Shoichiro; Zheng, Danni; Heeley, Emma; Arima, Hisatomi; Yang, Jie; Wu, Guojun; Chen, Guofang; Zhang, Shihong; Delcourt, Candice; Lavados, Pablo; Robinson, Thompson; Lindley, Richard I; Wang, Xia; Chalmers, John; Anderson, Craig S",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000001628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26958746/,322
140481,Emerging cellular and pharmacologic therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome.,2020-12-03,"BACKGROUND Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) are characterized by maladaptive responses to both positive and negative outcomes, which have been linked to localized abnormal activations in cortical and striatal brain regions. However, the exact neural circuitry implicated in such abnormalities remains largely unexplored. METHOD In this study 26 unmedicated adults with MDD and 29 matched healthy controls (HCs) completed a monetary incentive delay task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses probed group differences in connectivity separately in response to positive and negative outcomes (i.e. monetary gains and penalties). RESULTS Relative to HCs, MDD subjects displayed decreased connectivity between the caudate and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in response to monetary gains, yet increased connectivity between the caudate and a different, more rostral, dACC subregion in response to monetary penalties. Moreover, exploratory analyses of 14 MDD patients who completed a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial after the baseline fMRI scans indicated that a more normative pattern of cortico-striatal connectivity pre-treatment was associated with greater improvement in symptoms 12 weeks later. CONCLUSIONS These results identify the caudate as a region with dissociable incentive-dependent dACC connectivity abnormalities in MDD, and provide initial evidence that cortico-striatal circuitry may play a role in MDD treatment response. Given the role of cortico-striatal circuitry in encoding action-outcome contingencies, such dysregulated connectivity may relate to the prominent disruptions in goal-directed behavior that characterize MDD.","Admon, R; Nickerson, L D; Dillon, D G; Holmes, A J; Bogdan, R; Kumar, P; Dougherty, D D; Iosifescu, D V; Mischoulon, D; Fava, M; Pizzagalli, D A",Psychological medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291714001123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055809/,322
140947,Tidal volume measurement error in pressure control modes of mechanical ventilation: A model study.,2016,"PURPOSE Baby shampoo is used as an alternative surgical skin preparation, but the evidence supporting its use is scarce with no descriptions of efficacy in the periocular region. The authors compare the efficacy of baby shampoo, povidone-iodine (PI, Betadine) and isopropyl alcohol (IA) in reducing eyelid skin bacterial load. METHODS Prospective, randomized, comparative, and interventional trial. Bacterial load on adult, human eyelid skin was quantitated before and after cleansing with 1) dilute baby shampoo, 2) 10% PI, or 3) 70% IA. Paired skin swabs were collected from a 1 cm area of the upper eyelid of subjects before and after a standardized surgical scrub technique. Samples were cultured on 5% sheep blood agar for 24 hours. The number of colony forming units (CFU) was assessed and bacterial load per square centimeter of eyelid skin was quantified. RESULTS Baseline and postcleansing samples were assessed from 42 eyelids of 42 subjects (n = 14 for each of baby shampoo, PI, and IA). Before cleansing, similar amounts of bacterial flora were grown from all specimens (median log CFU/cm = 2.04 before baby shampoo, 2.01 before PI, 2.11 before IA; p > 0.05). All 3 cleansing agents significantly reduced the bacterial load (p < 0.01 for each). There was no statistically significant difference in postcleansing bacterial load between the 3 cleansing agents (median log CFU/cm = 0.48 after baby shampoo, 0.39 after PI, 0.59 after IA; p > 0.05). Change from baseline in bacterial load was statistically similar for all 3 agents (median reduction in log CFU/cm = 1.28 with baby shampoo, 1.57 with PI, 1.40 with IA; p > 0.05). These corresponded to bacterial load reductions of 96.3%, 96.6%, and 98.4% for baby shampoo, PI, and IA, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Baby shampoo achieved comparable diminution in eyelid skin bacterial load to PI or IA. These data suggest baby shampoo may be an effective preoperative cleansing agent.","Garcia, Giancarlo A; Nguyen, Christine V; Yonkers, Marc A; Tao, Jeremiah P",Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/iop.0000000000000850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28072611/,322
143506,"""Size Matters"" in Regard to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Case Volume and Mortality!",2018,"Tuberculosis remains a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with 10 million cases and 1.5 million deaths in 2018. Achieving ""End TB"" prevention and care goals by 2035 will likely require a new tuberculosis vaccine. The tuberculosis vaccine development pipeline has seen encouraging progress; however, questions around their population impact and implementation remain. Mathematical modelling investigates these questions to inform vaccine development and deployment strategies. We provide an update on the current vaccine development pipeline, and a systematic literature review of mathematical modelling of the epidemiological impact of new tuberculosis vaccines. Fourteen prophylactic tuberculosis vaccine candidates are currently in clinical trials. Two candidates have shown promise in phase II proof-of-concept efficacy trials: M72/AS01E demonstrated 49.7% (95% CI; 2.1, 74.2) protection against tuberculosis disease, and BCG revaccination demonstrated 45.4% (95% CI; 6.4, 68.1) protection against sustained Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Since the last modelling review, new studies have investigated the epidemiological impact of differential vaccine characteristics, age targeting, and spatial/risk group targeting. Critical research priorities for M72/AS01E include completing the currently-in-design trial, powered to improve the precision of efficacy estimates, include uninfected populations, and further assess safety and immunogenicity in HIV-infected people. For BCG revaccination, the priority is completing the ongoing confirmation of efficacy trial. Critical modelling gaps remain on the full value proposition of vaccines, comparisons with other interventions, and more realistic implementation strategies. Using carefully designed trials and modelling, we must prepare for success, to ensure that new vaccines will be promptly received by those most in need.","Weerasuriya, C K; Clark, R A; White, R G; Harris, R C",Journal of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.13197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33128834/,322

For patients, there is also a high financial burden due to direct and indirect costs arising from their multimorbidity. It is unclear how this financial burden affects patients. This study aims to synthesise qualitative evidence exploring the experience of financial burden from the perspective of patients with multimorbidity. Methods: The review will be reported using the ENTREQ guidelines. A systematic search of Lilacs, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts will be conducted using a predefined search strategy. A search of fourteen pre-specified websites will be conducted for grey literature. Forward and backward citation checking of included studies will be conducted also. Studies will be included if they contain primary qualitative research and reference the experience of financial burden from the perspective of adult (≥ 18 years) community dwelling patients with multimorbidity. Studies from any country and in any language will be included. Titles and abstracts of search results will be screened; if a study appears relevant, then full-texts will be screened for eligibility. Study characteristics of included articles will be extracted. Study quality will be evaluated using the critical appraisal skills programme (CASP) checklist for qualitative research. These three processes will be carried out by two reviewers independently. Thematic-synthesis will be used to analyse data. This will be carried out by one reviewer and cross-checked by a second reviewer. The GRADE CERQual approach will be used to assess the overall confidence in the evidence.

220317,Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation and Coronavirus Disease 2019-Reply,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are among the most medically fragile patient populations with extreme demands for caregivers. Indeed, with earlier hospital discharges, the demands placed on caregivers continue to intensify. Moreover, an increased number of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations are being performed worldwide, and this expensive procedure has significant economic consequences. Thus, the health and well-being of family caregivers have attracted widespread attention. Mobile health technology has been shown to deliver flexible, and time- and cost-sparing interventions to support family caregivers across the care trajectory. OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to leverage technology to deliver a novel caregiver-facing mobile health intervention named Roadmap 2.0. We will evaluate the effectiveness of Roadmap 2.0 in family caregivers of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS: The Roadmap 2.0 intervention will consist of a mobile randomized trial comparing a positive psychology intervention arm with a control arm in family caregiver-patient dyads. The primary outcome will be caregiver health-related quality of life, as assessed by the PROMIS Global Health scale at day 120 post-transplant. Secondary outcomes will include other PROMIS caregiver- and patient-reported outcomes, including companionship, self-efficacy for managing symptoms, self-efficacy for managing daily activities, positive affect and well-being, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety. Semistructured qualitative interviews will be conducted among participants at the completion of the study. We will also measure objective physiological markers (eg, sleep, activity, heart rate) through wearable wrist sensors and health care utilization data through electronic health records. RESULTS: We plan to enroll 166 family caregiver-patient dyads for the full data analysis. The study has received Institutional Review Board approval as well as Code Review and Information Assurance approval from our health information technology services. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study has been briefly put on hold. However, recruitment began in August 2020. We have converted all recruitment, enrollment, and onboarding processes to be conducted remotely through video telehealth. Consent will be obtained electronically through the Roadmap 2.0 app. CONCLUSIONS: This mobile randomized trial will determine if positive psychology-based activities delivered through mobile health technology can improve caregiver health-related quality of life over a 16-week study period. This study will provide additional data on the effects of wearable wrist sensors on caregiver and patient self-report outcomes.

In spite of all rapidly and widely emerging scientific data on epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the COVID-19 disease, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuing to propagate in lack of definitive and specific therapeutic agents. Current therapeutic strategies are mainly focused on viral inhibition by antiviral drugs and hampering the exuberant immune response of the host by immunomodulatory drugs. In this review, we have studied the reports of the largest clinical trials intended to COVID-19 treatment published during the first year of the pandemics. In general, these results concentrate on seven therapeutic options: remdesivir, chloroguine/hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir combination, corticosteroids, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies. In line with the reviewed data, as of January 2021, most of the evidence support the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with moderate and severe forms of the disease and provide reliable data on the substantial beneficial effect of corticosteroids in patients requiring supplemental oxygen. Moreover, preliminary RECOVERY trial results have demonstrated the efficacy of tociluzumab in the treatment of critically ill patients. The reports presenting the outcomes of the other immune-based therapies under investigation are enthusiastically awaited.","Panovska-Stavridis, Irina; Ridova, Nevenka; Stojanoska, Tatjana; Demiri, Ilir; Stevanovic, Milena; Stojanovska, Simona; Ristevska, Tara; Dimkovski, Aleksandar; Filipce, Venko; Dimovski, Aleksandar; Grozdanova, Aleksandra",Pril (Makedon Akad Nauk Umet Odd Med Nauki),,322

257592,Regional Planning for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Allocation During Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"The potential zoonotic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2), are of global health concerns. Early diagnosis is the milestone in their mitigation, control, and eradication. Many diagnostic techniques are showing great success and have many advantages, such as the rapid turnover of the results, high accuracy, and high specificity and sensitivity. However, some of these techniques have several pitfalls if samples were not collected, processed, and transported in the standard ways and if these techniques were not practiced with extreme caution and precision. This may lead to false-negative/positive results. This may affect the downstream management of the affected cases. These techniques require regular fine-tuning, upgrading, and optimization. The continuous evolution of new strains and viruses belong to the coronaviruses is hampering the success of many classical techniques. There are urgent needs for next generations of coronaviruses diagnostic assays (NG-CoV-DAs) that overcome these pitfalls. This new generation of diagnostic tests should be able to do simultaneous, multiplex, and high throughput detection of various coronavirus in one reaction. Furthermore, the development of novel assays and techniques that enable the in situ detection of the virus on the environmental samples, especially air, water, and surfaces should be given considerable attention in the future. These approaches will have a substantial positive impact on the mitigation and eradication of coronaviruses, including the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This article is protected by copyright.

Specifically, impaired redox homeostasis and associated oxidative stress appear to be important biological processes that may account for increased individual susceptibility to diverse environmental insults. The aim of this Viewpoint is to justify (1) the crucial roles of glutathione in determining individual responsiveness to COVID-19 infection and disease pathogenesis and (2) the feasibility of using glutathione as a means for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 illness. The hypothesis that glutathione deficiency is the most plausible explanation for serious manifestation and death in COVID-19 patients was proposed on the basis of an exhaustive literature analysis and observations. The hypothesis unravels the mysteries of epidemiological data on the risk factors determining serious manifestations of COVID-19 infection and the high risk of death and opens real opportunities for effective treatment and prevention of the disease.","Polonikov, Alexey",ACS Infect Dis,,322

Some claims are often false or misleading. Using the economic, clinical, and humanistic outcomes (ECHO) model, this study aimed to review warning letters (WLs) issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to manufacturers selling products with fraudulent claims. Methods: A content-analysis approach was used to review WLs obtained from the FDA website. With seven WLs issued in March 2020, a data collection form (DCF) was developed using relevant literature and FDA guidance document on promotional materials from manufacturers. This DCF was then pilot tested on the other six WLs issued in March 2020. Using this DCF, two researchers reviewed WLs issued from April 2020 to December 2020. If there were disagreements between the two researchers, the third and fourth reviewers arbitrated on the disagreements;or the letters were reviewed together to determine a final classification. Results: A total of 141 WLs were analyzed. The products cited in the letters used online media (e.g., company website, Facebook, and Twitter) more commonly as promotional tools than print or broadcast. The products were predominantly drugs (79%), followed by medical device (11%) and food & beverages (6%). The average number of violations reported in each WL was 5.0 ± 3.4. Almost all products (93%) targeted consumers, three products (2%) targeted health providers, and three products (2%) targeted both consumers and health providers. Out of 151 fraudulent claims in 141 letters, 118 claims (78%) were related to clinical outcomes, 22 (15%) were humanistic, and 11 (7%) were related to economic outcomes. Conclusions: This study revealed COVID-19 related fraudulent and unproven claims included in the WLs issued by the FDA. Protecting consumers from products with such claims is crucial to promote consumer safety during COVID-19.","Guo, J.; Yang, J.; Muzumdar, J.; Park, T.",Value in Health,,322

259976,"COVID-19 Does Not Lead to a ""Typical"" Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome",2020,"BACKGROUND Infants and young children with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have acute progressive hypoxic respiratory failure caused by a variety of extrapulmonary pathogenic factors and cardiogenic factors. Diffuse alveolar injury and pulmonary fibrosis both are pathological features of ARDS. This study investigated the effect of Rehmannia Radix extract (RRE) on pulmonary fibrosis of infants with ARDS. MATERIAL AND METHODS The human lung fibroblasts cell line HFL1 was treated with various concentrations of Rehmannia Radix extract in different groups for different times. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assay were performed to detect cell apoptosis, and CCK8 assay was utilized to analyze cell proliferation. TGF-ß1 expression was detected by real-time quantitative PCR, and protein-level expressions of Caspase3, TGF-ß1, Bcl-2, and Smad3 were measured by western blot and immunohistochemical staining in cells or tissues. TGF-ß1 was overexpressed by recombinant human TGF-ß1 (2 ng/mL) and the treated cells and culture supernatant were harvested for analysis in each step. Bleomycin was used to induce a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis and was confirmed by HE pathological sections. RESULTS Flow cytometry and TUNEL results showed that RRE promoted the apoptosis of HFL1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and it inhibited the proliferation of HFL1 cells. Upregulation of TGF-ß1 reversed the effects of RRE in HFL1 cells. RRE alleviated pulmonary fibrosis in mice through downregulating Bcl-2, TGF-ß1, and Smad3 expression. CONCLUSIONS RRE promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of HFL1, and then arrested the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. RRE had a significant inhibitory effect on TGF-ß1 and Smad3. These results suggest that RRE directly prevents the development of pulmonary fibrosis by affecting the expression of TGF-ß1 and Smad3.","Hu, Xiaoming; Zhu, Dongzhe",Med Sci Monit,,322
260728,Consideration of Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 As Viral Sepsis and Potential Use of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,2020,"Geometrically complex anatomical regions are difficult to represent in 2D images presented to students in lecture slides and reference texts. This problem has been traditionally mitigated by interactions with cadaveric specimens or other 3D anatomical models. However, given a recent trend away from cadaver-based anatomy education and exasperated by remote teaching in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, student access to more interactive means of learning have been limited. In response to these issues, we have created an immersive, web-based tour of the heart using the Mozilla Hubs platform. A 3D model of a human heart displaying all internal features, coronary arteries, and great vessels was developed into a virtual space to serve as a digital classroom. To supplement the morphology of the heart, additional informational panels, structure labels, and pathways through the heart were added. Students choose an avatar and navigate using keyboard commands reminiscent of PC and web-based gaming, and the virtual classroom affords the ability to communicate with others in the space verbally or through text. The scale of the heart relative to an avatar is such that users experience each chamber as a large room where they are able to look up and down, rotate completely, and walk along a horizontal plane within and between each chamber. This resource was deployed as a supplemental, non-mandatory experience first introduced with a faculty member present following the heart and mediastinum lab, though the link to the experience was made available for students to return at any time. Three anonymous surveys were sent to students. The pre-experience survey asked 3 multiple choice questions on heart anatomy (n=24). The second was given following the experience, asking the same 3 multiple choice questions and for feedback on the utility of the experience itself (n=15). Of the 3 questions, the first increased in percent correct from 95.83% to 100%, the second question decreased from 83.33% to 80%, and the final question increased from 79.17% to 100% correct. In the post survey 93.33% of respondents reported they were very or somewhat likely to return to the experience for independent review and 57.15% reported they were very or somewhat likely to return with peers or a faculty member. 93.33% agreed that the experience increased their knowledge of the spatial relationships of the structures within each chamber and 86.67% agreed that the experience increased their knowledge of the structures found in each chamber. The final survey, sent out 4 weeks later at the end of the course, was open to the entire class (n=65). Among the same 3 multiple choice questions, the first was answered correctly by 100% of responders, the second by 98.46%, and the last by 93.85%. The majority (3/5) of incorrect answers were provided by students who did not engage in the Hubs experience at all. Of the students who did utilize the experience, 54.17% agreed it helped them understand the locations of and geometric relationships between internal structures of the heart at the time, 20.83% agreed it helped perform better on the thorax exam, and 25% agreed it helped retain knowledge of the internal structures of the heart. Future uses of Hubs in anatomy instruction will include more task-based interactions with the space and incentives for collaborative learning with expansion to other anatomical regions.","Ramirez, Kristen Dorsainville Gregory",The FASEB Journal,,322

Using data from the HINTS 5 cycle 1-3, we examined cigarette and e-cigarette history and current use, as well as perceptions of the dangers of e-cigarette use relative to cigarette use. Primary predictors were Hispanic ethnic group, gender, age, education, income, and English language proficiency. Binary outcomes were modeled using the logit link, and multinomial outcome variables were modeled using generalized logit model. Fifty-three percent of participants were Mexican, 8% Puerto Rican, 4% were Cuban, and 35% identified as other Hispanics. Of the 1618 respondents, 23% were former cigarette smokers and 10% were current cigarette smokers. Twenty percent reported history of electronic cigarettes and 4% reported current use. In multivariable models, Hispanic women were significantly less likely to report ever being smokers compared to Hispanic men (aOR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.42, 0.88). Puerto Ricans were 2.4 times as likely to report being current smokers (95% CI = 1.11, 5.11) compared to Mexicans. Among Hispanics, significant differences in e-cigarette and cigarette use behaviors emerged by gender, age, ethnicity, and cancer history, with implications for tailoring smoking prevention and cessation messages.","Cardona, Stephanie; Calixte, Rose; Rivera, Argelis; Islam, Jessica Yasmine; Vidot, Denise Christina; Camacho-Rivera, Marlene",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,322
265235,Lessons Learned From the Front Line: Outcomes of Noninvasive Ventilation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia in China,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has limited endoscopic utilization causing significant health and economic losses Accordingly, gastroenterology (GI) societies recommended COVID-19 testing to screen all patients undergoing endoscopic procedures which resulted in a relatively increased access to such interventions Nonetheless, this approach can be limited by the cost and availability of testing We evaluated the feasibility and yield of this approach in detecting patients with COVID-19 at our community-based GI practice which is located in an area with a low COVID-19 prevalence of &lt;1% METHODS: This is a clinical, non-interventional, observation-based quality initiative of patients scheduled for endoscopic procedures at our community-based GI practice from May 11th to June 4th, 2020 All patients underwent symptoms screening, followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing Based on the testing result, a decision whether to proceed with endoscopic procedure or not was made After the procedure, providers were followed closely to early detect any concerning symptoms RESULTS: A total of 285 patients were scheduled for endoscopic procedures during that time period, 270 were tested for COVID-19 Table 1 details patient baseline characteristics None of the patients had a positive test result, with only one individual appearing symptomatic but later testing negative The remaining 15 patients did not undergo their scheduled endoscopic procedure as they did not undergo the required COVID-19 testing prior to their procedure (Figure 1) None of the providers developed COVID-19 related symptoms after the endoscopic procedures CONCLUSION: Over a 1-month period, we observed a 0% positive test rate for COVID-19 at our GI practice The results suggest that the current testing protocol may not be cost effective or add much to the safety of patients and providers in low prevalence areas The most commonly used PCR test can have up to 48 hours turn-around time, which could potentially delay patient care and the overall efficiency of the practice Therefore, preserving PCR testing to patients with high index of suspicion at GI practices with similar positive test rates as ours, may be a reasonable option in order to improve access to endoscopic procedures Larger scale, multi-center studies are needed to corroborate these findings In the interim, strict use of personal protective equipment during endoscopic procedures should continue to be strongly emphasized (Figure Presented)","Walsh, C.; Hawa, F.; Dobrusin, A.; Gladshteyn, M.; Duda, J.; Velarde, M.; Minnema, K.; Walsh, J.; Gunaratnam, N.",American Journal of Gastroenterology,,322

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a novel porous organic material, have attracted great attention. In this work, the spherical triphenylbenzene-dimethoxyterephthaldehyde-COFs (TPB-DMTP-COFs) were synthesized by a simple room temperature method, and due to their attractive properties, such as high outstanding acid-base stability, large specific surface area, low skeletal density, inherent porosity and high crystallinity, so TPB-DMTP-COFs as ideal solid phase extraction adsorbents showed excellent adsorption performance for trace polar sulfonamides in food and water. TPB-DMTP-COFs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and so on. The important parameters were optimized to improve the extraction efficiency of TPB-DMTP-COFs toward sulfonamides. Analysis of sulfonamides was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The developed method based on TPB-DMTP-COFs material achieved low limits of detection (0.5-1.0 ng L-1), wide linearity (5-1000 ng L-1), and good repeatability (2.5%-8.7%). The possible extraction mechanism was also discussed. Finally, the method was successfully applied to the enrichment and detection of sulfonamides in environmental water samples and food samples. The present study indicated that TPB-DMTP-COFs had splendid prospects in highly sensitive analysis of other pollutants in complex matrix.","Wen, Lian; Liu, Lu; Wang, Xia; Wang, Ming-Lin; Lin, Jin-Ming; Zhao, Ru-Song",J Chromatogr A,,322
271692,The Janus Face of Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Coagulopathy,2021,"Several species of herbivores feed on maize in field and storage setups, making the development of multiple insect resistance a critical breeding target. In this study, an association mapping panel of 341 tropical maize lines was evaluated in three field environments for resistance to fall armyworm (FAW), whilst bulked grains were subjected to a maize weevil (MW) bioassay and genotyped with Diversity Array Technology's single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers. A multi-locus genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed 62 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) associated with FAW and MW resistance traits on all 10 maize chromosomes, of which, 47 and 31 were discovered at stringent Bonferroni genome-wide significance levels of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively, and located within or close to multiple insect resistance genomic regions (MIRGRs) concerning FAW, SB, and MW. Sixteen QTNs influenced multiple traits, of which, six were associated with resistance to both FAW and MW, suggesting a pleiotropic genetic control. Functional prioritization of candidate genes (CGs) located within 10-30 kb of the QTNs revealed 64 putative GWAS-based CGs (GbCGs) showing evidence of involvement in plant defense mechanisms. Only one GbCG was associated with each of the five of the six combined resistance QTNs, thus reinforcing the pleiotropy hypothesis. In addition, through in silico co-functional network inferences, an additional 107 network-based CGs (NbCGs), biologically connected to the 64 GbCGs, and differentially expressed under biotic or abiotic stress, were revealed within MIRGRs.

Patients with tuberculosis are not only more likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 but also likely to have adverse outcomes once infected. The sequelae of more severe forms of COVID-19 in patients who have recovered from TB but have residual compromised lung function, are also likely to be devastating. These diseases share almost identical bio-social determinants like poverty, overcrowding, diabetes and pollution and some clinical similarities. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our global response to it with lockdowns, are likely to leave a profound and long-lasting impact on TB diagnosis and control, potentially leading to an additional 6.3 million cases of TB between 2020 and 2025, and an additional 1.4 million TB deaths during this time. Novel solutions will need to be urgently devised or else TB control targets will never be met and indeed may be set back by 5–8 years.","Udwadia, Zarir F.; Vora, Agam; Tripathi, Awatansh R.; Malu, Ketan N.; Lange, Christoph; Sara Raju, Reyma",Indian J.

The aim is to show that despite diversity among people, the hard times made them unite and overcome countless difficulties.BackgroundThe COVID 19 pandemic has been a period of global health crisis and has exponentially affected mental health issues in the world population. In these difficult times, several International Medical Graduates (IMGs), who had come to the UK to attend their PLAB exams, were left stranded as the exams were postponed, flights cancelled and borders sealed. Faced with huge uncertainty their mental health was of great concern.At this time the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) came forward to help this cohort of stranded doctors in terms of accommodation, finances, mental health support, preparation for exams to the extent of liaising with General Medical Council (GMC) and Home Office. The virtual support group provided a platform for IMGs from different nations and cultures to get in touch with each other helping overcome mental burden and stress.The stories presented in the poster show how unity in diversity helped these young doctors deal with mental trauma amidst the Pandemic.Method276 doctors from 27 countries were looked after by BAPIO. From those excerpts taken from 26 IMGs, personal narratives was used as a method for qualitative assessment.The percentage of IMGs clearing their exams and getting jobs in the NHS has been used for quantitative assessment.ResultQualitative: The personal narratives of the IMGs show how they were positively impacted by staying together albeit different nationalities and cultural background.Quantitative: A total of 21 IMGs out of the 26 cleared their PLAB 2 exams and got registration under General Medical Council giving a percentage of 81.7%. 20 IMGs have successfully joined the NHS in various posts giving a job success rate of 95.2%.ConclusionThe experience of living and sharing housings with people from different nationalities, has increased appreciation and also prepared them to work in the NHS which has a diverse work force. This learning experience has been integral for all of us in shaping our life in the UK making everyone more compassionate.","Meena Afzal, Lakha Bhowmik Anindya Bisht Sneha Shrestha Suzani Kantappa Gajanan Shah Samir",BJPsych Open,,322

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shares some similarities with IPF. SARS-CoV-2 related genes have been reported to be broadly regulated by N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification. Here, we identified the association between m6A methylation regulators, COVID-19 infection pathways, and immune responses in IPF. The characteristic gene expression networks and immune infiltration patterns of m6A-SARS-CoV-2 related genes in different tissues of IPF were revealed. We subsequently evaluated the influence of these related gene expression patterns and immune infiltration patterns on the prognosis/lung function of IPF patients. The IPF cohort was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to identify the correlations among genes or cells. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to assess the infiltration of 22 types of immune cells. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and proportional hazards model (Cox model) were used to develop the prognosis prediction model. Our research is pivotal for further understanding of the cellular and genetic links between IPF and SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may contribute to providing new ideas for prognosis assessment and treatment of both diseases.","Li, Xinyu; Peng, Cheng; Zhu, Ziqing; Cai, Haozheng; Zhuang, Quan",Aging (Albany NY),,322

Recognizing that these fomites can be a secondary route for disease transmission, exploring the deposition pattern of such sessile respiratory droplets on daily-use substrates thus becomes crucial. EXPERIMENTS: The used surrogate respiratory fluid is composed of a water-based salt-protein solution, and its precipitation dynamics is studied on four different substrates (glass, ceramic, steel, and PET). For tracking the final deposition of viruses in these droplets, 100 nm virus emulating particles (VEP) are used and their distribution in dried-out patterns is identified using fluorescence and SEM imaging techniques. FINDINGS: The final precipitation pattern and VEP deposition strongly depend on the interfacial transport processes, edge evaporation, and crystallization dynamics. A constant contact radius mode of evaporation with a mixture of capillary and Marangoni flows results in spatio-temporally varying edge deposits. Dendritic and cruciform-shaped crystals are majorly seen in all substrates except on steel, where regular cubical crystals are formed. The VEP deposition is higher near the three-phase contact line and crystal surfaces. The results showed the role of interfacial processes in determining the initiation of fomite-type infection pathways in the context of COVID-19.","Rasheed, Abdur; Sharma, Shubham; Kabi, Prasenjit; Saha, Abhishek; Chaudhuri, Swetaprovo; Basu, Saptarshi",J Colloid Interface Sci,,322

To analyse some clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of Covid-19 in the context of the Czech Republic and to compare them with the data from the most recent literature. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analysed data on patients admitted to the IDC between 12 March 2020 and 5 May 2020. The study cohort included 53 patients with Covid-19, 25 females and 28 males, with an average age of 57 years. The parameters analysed were clinical symptoms, average length of hospital stay, complications, and death. Additional data concerned the age, weight, smoking habits, history of comorbidities, and selected laboratory results. These data were compared between groups of patients differing in severity of the course of Covid-19. Finally, imaging findings, serology results, and therapy outcomes were studied. Statistical analysis was performed using the SigmaStat software. RESULTS: Eleven (20.8%) patients had a mild course of the disease, 16 (30.2%) patients had a moderate course, 22 (41.5%) patients had a severe course, and four (7.5%) patients had a critical course. The study patients presented with the following clinical symptoms: fever in 88.5% of cases, cough in 84.6% of cases, difficulty breathing in 77.4% of cases, diarrhoea in 23.1% of cases, chest pain in 17.3% of cases, and anosmia in 11.5% of cases. The average length of hospital stay was eight days. The most common complication was a bacterial superinfection, reported in 17 (32.1%) study patients. The overall case fatality rate for Covid-19 in our study was 5.7%. The average age of the study cohort was 57 years, and patients with a severe course of the disease were of older average age than those with a less severe course of the disease (p &lt; 0.05). The predominant comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The analysis of the baseline laboratory data showed significant differences between the groups of patients differing in severity of the course of Covid-19 in CRP, procalcitonin, and d-dimers but not in lymphocyte count. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs was performed in 22 patients, and 21 of them had typical findings for Covid-19. The average MuLBSTA score for Covid-19 pneumonia severity in our study cohort was 11.5 points and was not associated with the severity of the course of the disease. Serology tests were performed in 43 study patients, with 29 (67.4%) of them turning out positive in the first test and other five (11.6%) testing positive when retested. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was given experimentally as monotherapy or in combination with azithromycin (AZI) to 24 (45.3%) patients. Two patients on HCQ therapy also received inosinum pranobexum (isoprinosine) for severe lymphopenia, one patient received convalescent plasma, six patients were given AZI alone, and one patient was treated with inosinum pranobexum alone. Altogether 37.7% of study patients were prescribed other antibiotics for confirmed or suspected bacterial superinfection. Standard clinical and pharmaceutical care was provided to patients with particular focus on the safety of off-label drug use. HCQ was with drawn in three patients due to a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc). CONCLUSIONS: In the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, our study patients showed comorbidities and risk factors which are consistent with the international literature, but the course of the disease was mostly moderate to severe, with a low proportion of critically ill patients and fatal outcomes. As soon as new information became available, new diagnostic and therapeutic options were introduced into routine practice. Based on our experience, we are well prepared for a possible second wave of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of the diagnostics, but the therapeutic options still remain very limited.","Bartovská, Z; Andrle, F; Beran, O; Zlámal, M; Rezác, D; Murinova, I; Holub, M",Epidemiol Mikrobiol Imunol,,322
303143,Risk Factors for Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019-Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2020,"In February 2020, our laboratory started to offer a RT-qPCR assay for the qualitative detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. A few months after the assay was released to our patients, some materials, reagents, and equipment became in short supply. Alternative protocols were necessary in order to avoid stopping testing to the population. However, the suitability of these alternatives needs to be validated before their use. Here, we investigated if saliva is a reliable alternative specimen to nasopharyngeal swabs; if 0.45% saline is a reliable alternative to guanidine hydrochloride as a collection viral transport media; the stability of SARS-COV-2 in guanidine hydrochloride and in 0.45% saline for 10 and 50 days at room temperature; and if the primers/probe concentration and thermocycling times could be reduced so as to overcome the short supply of these reagents and equipment, without a significant loss of the assay performance. We found that saliva is not an appropriated specimen for our method-nasopharyngeal swabs perform better. Saline (0.45%) and guanidine hydrochloride have a similar SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic capability as tube additives. Reliable SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection can be performed after sample storage for 10 days at room temperature (18-23 °C) in both 0.45% saline and guanidine hydrochloride. Using synthetic RNA, and decreasing the concentration of primers by five-fold and probes by 2.5-fold, changed the assay limit of detection (LOD) from 7.2 copies/reaction to 23.7 copies/reaction and the subsequent reducing of thermocycling times changed the assay LOD from 23.7 copies/reaction to 44.2 copies/reaction. However, using real clinical samples with Cq values ranging from ~12.15 to ~36.46, the results of the three tested conditions were almost identical. These alterations will not affect the vast majority of diagnostics and increase the daily testing capability in 30% and increase primers and probe stocks in 500% and 250%, respectively. Taken together, the alternative protocols described here overcome the short supply of tubes, reagents and equipment during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, avoiding the collapse of test offering for the population: 105,757 samples were processed, and 25,156 SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics were performed from 9 May 2020 to 30 June 2020.","Barra, Gustavo Barcelos; Santa Rita, Ticiane Henriques; Mesquita, Pedro Góes; Jácomo, Rafael Henriques; Nery, Lídia Freire Abdalla",,,322

307927,"Reply to: ""Comment on ""Autoimmune hepatitis developing after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine: Causality or casualty?""""",2021,"Introduction: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a recommended treatment for chronic refractory neuropathic pain. During the COVID-19 pandemic, elective procedures have been postponed indefinitely both to provide capacity to deal with the emergency caseload and to avoid exposure of elective patients to COVID-19. This survey aimed to explore the effect of the pandemic on chronic pain in this group and the views of patients towards undergoing SCS treatment when routine services should resume. Methods: This was a prospective, multi-centre telephone patient survey that analysed data from 330 patients with chronic pain who were on an SCS waiting list. Questions focussed on severity of pain, effect on mental health, medication consumption and reliance on support networks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Views towards undergoing SCS therapy were also ascertained. Counts and percentages were generated, and chi-square tests of independence explored the impact of COVID-19 risk (very high, high, low) on survey responses. Results: Pain, mental health and patient’s ability to self-manage pain deteriorated in around 47%, 50% and 38% of patients, respectively. Some patients reported increases in pain medication consumption (37%) and reliance on support network (41%). Patients showed a willingness to attend for COVID-19 testing (92%), self-isolate prior to SCS (94%) and undergo the procedure as soon as possible (76%). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains a strong clinical need for patients with chronic pain identified as likely SCS responders to be treated quickly. The current prioritisation of new SCS at category 4 (delayed more than 3 months) is challenged judging by this national survey. These patients are awaiting SCS surgery to relieve severe intractable neuropathic pain.

308960,Determining Cause of Death During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2021,"In this paper I discuss the ethical justifiability of the limitation of freedom of movement, in particular of the ban on running outdoors, enforced in Italy as a response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the spring of 2020. I argue that through the lens of public health ethics literature, the ban on running falls short of the criterion of proportionality that public health ethics scholars and international guidelines for the ethical management of infectious disease outbreak recommend for any measure that restricts essential individual freedoms, such as the freedom of movement. The public health ethics framework, however, falls short of explaining the widespread public support that the running ban has had in Italy. I discuss possible factors which could explain the public support for the ban in Italy. Finally, I raise the question of what societal implications the abandonment of the public health ethics framework based on proportionality might have. I conclude that if it is the case, as the history of pandemics teaches us, we will experience further waves of COVID-19 outbreaks, it becomes very important to raise these questions now, with an eye towards informing public health policies for the management of future COVID-19 outbreaks. This discussion should not become politicized along the lines of liberal pro-lockdown/conservative anti-lockdown. Instead, we should reflect on the trade-offs of lockdown policies according to a pluralist framework, in which COVID-19 related deaths are not the only possible value to pursue.","Camporesi, Silvia",J Bioeth Inq,,322

326880,Outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in Covid-19 or influenza - a single-center registry study,2020,"The highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 217 million people, claiming ~ 4.5 million lives to date. Although mandatory quarantines, lockdowns, and vaccinations help curb viral transmission, safe and effective preventative measures remain urgently needed. Here, we present a generic strategy for containing SARS-CoV-2 by cellulose materials. Specifically, we developed a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of a cellulose-binding domain and a nanobody (Nb) targeting the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The immobilization of the fusion proteins on cellulose substrates enhanced the capture efficiency of Nbs against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses of the wildtype and the D614G variant, the latter of which has been shown to confer higher infectivity. Furthermore, the fusion protein was integrated into a customizable chromatography with highly porous cellulose for neutralizing virus from contaminated fluids in a continuous and cost-effective fashion. Taken together, our work leverages low-cost cellulose materials and recently developed Nbs to provide a complementary approach to addressing the pandemic. IMPORTANCEThe ongoing efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic center around the development of point-of-care diagnostics, preventative measures, and therapeutic strategies against COVID-19. In contrast to existing work, we have provided a complementary approach to target and contain SARS-CoV-2 from contaminated fluids and surfaces. Specifically, we present a generic strategy for the capture and containing of SARS-CoV-2 by cellulose-based substrates. This was archived by developing a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of both a cellulose-binding domain and a nanobody specific for the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. As a proof-of-concept, our fusion protein-coated cellulose substrates exhibited enhanced capture efficiency against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus of both wildtype and the D614G mutant variants, the latter of which has been shown to confer higher infectivity. Furthermore, the fusion protein was integrated into a customizable chromatography with highly porous cellulose for neutralizing the virus from contaminated fluids in a highly continuous and cost-effective fashion.","Sun, Xin; Yang, Shaobo; Al-Dossary, Amal; Broitman, Shana; Ni, Yun; Yang, Mengdi; Li, Jiahe",,,322

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a descriptive analysis and content analysis based on an online survey among clinicians, researchers, and organizations. Our data were extracted from multiple-choice questions on access to SRHR services and risk of SRHR violations, and written responses to open-ended questions on threats to access and required response. RESULTS: The survey was answered by 51 people representing 29 countries. Eighty-six percent reported that access to contraceptive services was less or much less because of COVID-19, corresponding figures for surgical and medical abortion were 62% and 46%. The increased risk of gender-based and sexual violence was assessed as moderate or severe by 79%. Among countries with mildly restrictive abortion policies, 69% had implemented changes to facilitate access to abortion during the pandemic, compared with none among countries with severe restrictions (P < .001), 87.5% compared with 46% had implemented changes to facilitate access to contraception (P = .023). The content analysis showed that (a) prioritizations in health service delivery at the expense of SRHR, (b) lack of political will, (c) the detrimental effect of lockdown, and (d) the suspension of sexual education, were threats to SRHR access (theme 1). Requirements to mitigate these threats (theme 2) were (a) political will and support of universal access to SRH services, (b) the sensitization of providers, (c) free public transport, and (d) physical protective equipment. A contrasting third theme was the state of exception of the COVID-19 pandemic as a window of opportunity to push forward women's health and rights. CONCLUSIONS: Many countries have seen decreased access to and increased violations of SRHR during the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries with severe restrictions on abortion seem less likely to have implemented changes to SRHR delivery to mitigate this impact. Political will to support the advancement of SRHR is often lacking, which is fundamental to ensuring both continued access and, in a minority of cases, the solidification of gains made to SRHR during the pandemic.","Endler, Margit; Al-Haidari, Taghreed; Benedetto, Chiara; Chowdhury, Sameena; Christilaw, Jan; El Kak, Faysal; Galimberti, Diana; Garcia-Moreno, Claudia; Gutierrez, Miguel; Ibrahim, Shaimaa; Kumari, Shantha; McNicholas, Colleen; Mostajo Flores, Desirée; Muganda, John; Ramirez-Negrin, Atziri; Senanayake, Hemantha; Sohail, Rubina; Temmerman, Marleen; Gemzell-Danielsson, Kristina",Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,,322

The current study aims to identify the determinants of illness severity of COVID-19 based on ordinal responses. A retrospective cohort of COVID-19 patients from four hospitals in three provinces in China was established, and 598 patients were included from 1 January to 8 March 2020, and divided into moderate, severe and critical illness group. Relative variables were retrieved from electronic medical records. The univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were fitted to identify the independent predictors of illness severity. The cohort included 400 (66.89%) moderate cases, 85 (14.21%) severe and 113 (18.90%) critical cases, of whom 79 died during hospitalisation as of 28 April. Patients in the age group of 70+ years (OR = 3.419, 95% CI: 1.596-7.323), age of 40-69 years (OR = 1.586, 95% CI: 0.824-3.053), hypertension (OR = 3.372, 95% CI: 2.185-5.202), ALT >50 µ/l (OR = 3.304, 95% CI: 2.107-5.180), cTnI >0.04 ng/ml (OR = 7.464, 95% CI: 4.292-12.980), myohaemoglobin>48.8 ng/ml (OR = 2.214, 95% CI: 1.42-3.453) had greater risk of developing worse severity of illness. The interval between illness onset and diagnosis (OR = 1.056, 95% CI: 1.012-1.101) and interval between illness onset and admission (OR = 1.048, 95% CI: 1.009-1.087) were independent significant predictors of illness severity. Patients of critical illness suffered from inferior survival, as compared with patients in the severe group (HR = 14.309, 95% CI: 5.585-36.659) and in the moderate group (HR = 41.021, 95% CI: 17.588-95.678). Our findings highlight that the identified determinants may help to predict the risk of developing more severe illness among COVID-19 patients and contribute to optimising arrangement of health resources.","Xu, Kandi; Zhou, Min; Yang, Dexiang; Ling, Yun; Liu, Kui; Bai, Tao; Cheng, Zenghui; Li, Jian",Epidemiol Infect,,322

According to previous data from China, pre-existing health conditions dramatically increase the risk of dying from COVID-19. The presence of multiple diseases in older patients may be considered as a mark of frailty, which increases the person's vulnerability to stress and impairs the multisystemic compensatory effort to restore homeostasis. The clinical complexity associated with the management of frailty may increase the risk of complications during infection as well as the lack of the early recognition of atypical symptoms. There is an urgent need to share expertise and clinical management skills with geriatricians as well as the need for early diagnosis to start treatment at the earliest convenience in the community, with the aim to avoid the collapse of intensive care units.","Boccardi, Virginia; Ruggiero, Carmelinda; Mecocci, Patrizia",,,322

Overall, the impacts on food systems, poverty, and nutrition have been caused by a combination of a generalized economic recession and disruptions in agri-food supply chains.

The papers in this volume confirm that both income shocks and supply disruptions have affected food security and livelihoods the most where supply chains were more poorly integrated, and poverty and market informality had greater presence before COVID-19. Yet, as the pandemic still has societies worldwide in a stranglehold, outcomes remain uncertain and reliable data are still sparsely available. This Special Issue of Agricultural Economics provides new insights of the pandemics impact on food systems, household welfare, and food security, building on both model-based scenario analysis and new survey data. These methods have proven helpful in providing these insights amidst the unprecedented shock that the pandemic has caused to production systems and livelihoods worldwide.

The COVID-19 outbreak continues to have devastating consequences for human lives and the global economy. The B-LiFe mobile laboratory in Piedmont, Italy, was deployed for the surveillance of COVID-19 cases by large-scale testing of first responders. The objective was to assess the seroconversion among the regional civil protection (CP), police, health care professionals, and volunteers. The secondary objective was to detect asymptomatic individuals within this cohort in the light of age, sex, and residence. In this paper, we report the results of serological testing performed by the B-LiFe mobile laboratory deployed from 10 June to 23 July 2020. The tests included whole blood finger-prick and serum sampling for detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) antibodies. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was approximately 5% (294/6013). The results of the finger-prick tests and serum sample analyses showed moderate agreement (kappa = 0.77). Furthermore, the detection rates of serum antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) and S-RBD among the seroconverted individuals were positively correlated (kappa = 0.60), at least at the IgG level. Seroprevalence studies based on serological testing for the S-RBD protein or SARS-CoV-2 NP antibodies are not sufficient for diagnosis but might help in screening the population to be vaccinated and in determining the duration of seroconversion.","Nyabi, Omar; Bentahir, Mostafa; Ambroise, Jérôme; Bearzatto, Bertrand; Chibani, Nawfal; Smits, Benjamin; Durant, Jean François; Vybornov, Aleksandr; Thellin, Olivier; El Moualij, Benaissa; Gala, Jean-Luc",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,322

Three marsupial herbivores comprised 89% of the 1820 roadkills recorded during the 4.5-year survey period: rufous-bellied pademelon Thylogale billardierii (31.5% of total), common brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula (29.8%) and red-necked wallaby Notamacropus rufogriseus (27.9%). During April 2020, when human activity was most restricted in the study area, traffic volume decreased by 36% (i.e. by an average 13,520 vehicle movements per day) and wildlife roadkill decreased by 48% (i.e. from 44 to 23 roadkills). However, when restrictions eased, traffic volume and wildlife roadkill returned to baseline levels indicating that the respite was brief in terms of animal welfare and of limited conservation value for these widespread and abundant species. Nevertheless, the results of this study suggest that even short periods of traffic reduction or road closures could be used as part of a management strategy for the conservation of endangered wildlife populations and re-wildling programs where roadkill is a risk factor.","Driessen, Michael M",Biol Conserv,,322

For these reasons, agentic engagement during video-conferencing became critical for successful learning outcomes. This study explores the mediating effect agentic engagement has on collaborative language learning orientations (CLLO) within an EFL video-conferencing course to understand better how interactions influence academic learning expectations. A total of 329 (Male = 132, Female = 197) students were recruited from four South Korean universities to participate in this questionnaire study. Data analysis was carried out using the statistical software packages SPSS, and a series of data screening procedures were carried out. Findings revealed that collaborative language learning orientations were a statistically significant predictor of academic learning expectations, but this relationship was fully mediated when agentic engagement was added to the model. Students with a propensity for social language learning strategies believe they will succeed; however, this relationship is explained by their propensity to interact with the instructor when video-conferencing. An assortment of learning activities should be provided to support both collaborative and individual learning orientations for academic success. Students with collaborative learning tendencies and a propensity to actively engage the instructor during video conference classes are active participants in the eLearning context, possibly leading to positive course expectations.","Almusharraf, Norah Mansour; Bailey, Daniel",Journal of computer assisted learning,,322

Although, the scientists, researchers and doctors are working round the clock to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, it may take a year or two to make a safe and effective vaccine available for the world. In current circumstances, a solution must be developed to control or stop the spread of the virus. For this purpose, a novel technique based on call data record analysis (CDRA)and contact tracing is proposed that can effectively control the coronavirus outbreak. A positive coronavirus patient can be traced through CDRA and contact tracing. The technique can track the path traversed by the patient and collect the cell numbers of all those people who have met with the patient. Keeping in tact the privacy of this group of people, who are contacted through their cell numbers so that they can isolate themselves till the result of their coronavirus test arrives. If a test result of a person comes positive among the group, then he/she must be isolated and same CDRA and contact tracing procedures are adopted for that person. A COVID-19 patient is geo tagged and alerts are sent if any violation of isolation is done by the patient. Moreover, the general public is informed in advance to avoid the path followed by the patients. This cost effective mechanism is not only capable to control the coronavirus outbreak but also helps in isolating the patient in his/her house.","Nisar, Shibli; Zuhaib, Syed Muhammad Ali; Ulasyar, Abasin; Tariq, Muhammad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01521v1.pdf,322

We aimed to examine the association of maternal diet quality, as indicated by the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI), in pregnancy with offspring metabolic biomarkers and body composition at age 4-7 years. METHODS: We used data from 761 mother-offspring pairs from the Healthy Start study to examine sex-specific associations of HEI >57 vs &#8804;57 with offspring fasting glucose, leptin, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, percentage fat mass, BMI z score and log-transformed insulin, 1/insulin, HOMA-IR, adiponectin, triacylglycerols, triacylglycerols:HDL, fat mass, and sum of skinfolds. Multivariable linear regression models accounted for maternal race/ethnicity, age, education, smoking habits during pregnancy and physical activity, and child's age. RESULTS: During pregnancy, mean (SD) HEI score was 55.0 (13.3), and 43.0% had an HEI score >57. Among boys, there was an inverse association of maternal HEI with offspring glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR and adiponectin. For instance, maternal HEI >57 was associated with lower fasting glucose (-0.11; 95% CI -0.20, -0.02 mmol/l), and lower concentrations of: insulin by 15.3% (95% CI -24.6, -5.0), HOMA-IR by 16.3% (95% CI -25.7, -5.6) and adiponectin by 9.3% (95% CI -16.1, -2.0). Among girls, there was an inverse association of maternal HEI with insulin and a positive association with LDL. However, following covariate adjustment, all estimates among girls were attenuated to the null. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Greater compliance with the USA Dietary Guidelines via the HEI may improve the maternal-fetal milieu and decrease susceptibility for poor metabolic health among offspring, particularly boys. Future studies are warranted to confirm these associations and determine the underlying mechanisms.","Francis, Ellen C; Dabelea, Dana; Shankar, Kartik; Perng, Wei",Diabetologia,,322

365401,von Willebrand Factor Multimer Formation Contributes to Immunothrombosis in Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"Objective: Neural network de-identification studies have focused on individual datasets. These studies assume the availability of a sufficient amount of human-annotated data to train models that can generalize to corresponding test data. In real-world situations, however, researchers often have limited or no in-house training data. Existing systems and external data can help jump-start de-identification on in-house data; however, the most efficient way of utilizing existing systems and external data is unclear. This article investigates the transferability of a state-of-the-art neural clinical de-identification system, NeuroNER, across a variety of datasets, when it is modified architecturally for domain generalization and when it is trained strategically for domain transfer. Methods and Materials: We conducted a comparative study of the transferability of NeuroNER using four clinical note corpora with multiple note types from two institutions. We modified NeuroNER architecturally to integrate two types of domain generalization approaches. We evaluated each architecture using three training strategies. We measured: transferability from external sources; transferability across note types; the contribution of external source data when in-domain training data are available; and transferability across institutions. Results and Conclusions: Transferability from a single external source gave inconsistent results. Using additional external sources consistently yielded an F1-score of approximately 80%. Fine-tuning emerged as a dominant transfer strategy, with or without domain generalization. We also found that external sources were useful even in cases where in-domain training data were available. Transferability across institutions differed by note type and annotation label but resulted in improved performance.","Lee, Kahyun; Dobbins, Nicholas J.; McInnes, Bridget; Yetisgen, Meliha; Uzuner, Ozlem",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08517v3.pdf,322
365402,von Willebrand Factor Multimer Formation Contributes to Immunothrombosis in Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"The purpose of this case report is to demonstrate lung perfusion changes on dual-energy CT (DECT) in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province in China, the spectrum of lung parenchymal findings has been well described but the underlying pathophysiology is less well understood. DECT imaging contributes to the growing evidence that vascular dysregulation has an important role in the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Three patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 underwent DECT scans. One patient had a DECT for persistent spikes in temperature while the other two patients underwent dual-energy CT pulmonary angiograms (CTPA) for worsening shortness of breath, elevated D dimers and suspected pulmonary embolism. The perfusion abnormalities include focal areas of both hyperperfusion, hypoperfusion, and areas of hypoperfusion surrounded by hyperemia. In addition, dilatation of segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries was seen in relation to the lung parenchymal change. DECT has proven useful in supporting the hypothesis that vascular dysregulation plays a significant role in the pulmonary pathophysiology of COVID-19. Early identification and a high index of suspicion is required in the emergency department setting to identify and isolate cases even prior to the results of RT-PCR test being available. Vascular changes on DECT may be an additional radiological feature in detecting the presence of and predicting the severity of disease in the emergency department or acute care setting.","Ganti, Srujana; Kok, Shawn Shi Xian; Aftab, Syed; Halagatti, Sandeep Venkatesh; Wong, Steven Bak Siew; Uppaluri, Anandswaroop Srinivas",Emerg. radiol,,322

It is caused due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). It has the tendency to spread rapidly through person-to-person. Currently, several molecular diagnostic platforms such as PCR, qRT-PCR, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), CRISPR are utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. These conventional techniques are costly, time consuming and require sophisticated instrumentation facility with well trained personnel for testing. Hence, it is tough to provide testing en-masse to the people in developing countries. On the other hand, several serological biosensors such as lateral flow immunosensor, optical, electrochemical, microfluidics integrated electrochemical/fluorescence is currently utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. In current pandemic situation, there is an urgent need of rapid and efficient diagnosis on mass scale of SARS-CoV-2 for early stage detection. Early monitoring of viral infections can help to control and prevent the spreading of infections in large chunk of population. In this review, the SARS-CoV-2 and their biomarkers in biological samples, collection of samples and recently reported potential electrochemical immunosensors for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed.","Ranjan, Pushpesh; Singhal, Ayushi; Yadav, Shalu; Kumar, Neeraj; Murali, S; Sanghi, Sunil K; Khan, Raju",Int Rev Immunol,,322

This study aimed to analyze the satisfaction of patients and surgeons with the rapid expansion of telehealth at this time within the division of adult reconstructive surgery at a major urban academic tertiary hospital. METHODS: A total of 334 patients underging arthroplasty of the hip or knee who completed a telemedicine visit between 30 March and 30 April 2020 were sent a 14-question survey, scored on a five-point Likert scale. Eight adult reconstructive surgeons who used telemedicine during this time were sent a separate 14-question survey at the end of the study period. Factors influencing patient satisfaction were determined using univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression modelling. RESULTS: A total of 68 patients (20.4%) and 100% of the surgeons completed the surveys. Patients were ""Satisfied"" with their telemedicine visits (4.10/5.00 (SD 0.98)) and 19 (27.9%) would prefer telemedicine to in-person visits in the absence of COVID-19. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression modelling revealed that patients were more likely to be satisfied if their surgeon effectively responded to their questions or concerns (odds ratio (OR) 3.977; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.260 to 13.190; p = 0.019) and if their visit had a high audiovisual quality (OR 2.46; 95% CI 1.052 to 6.219; p = 0.042). Surgeons were ""Satisfied"" with their telemedicine experience (3.63/5.00 (SD 0.92)) and were ""Fairly Confident"" (4.00/5.00 (SD 0.53)) in their diagnostic accuracy despite finding the physical examinations to be only ""Slightly Effective"" (1.88/5.00 (SD 0.99)). Most adult reconstructive surgeons, seven of eight (87.5%) would continue to use telemedicine in the future. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine emerged as a valuable tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients undergoing arthroplasty and their surgeons were satisfied with telemedicine and see a role for its use after the pandemic. The audiovisual quality and the responsiveness of physicians to the concerns of patients determine their satisfaction. Future investigations should focus on improving the physical examination of patients through telemedicine and strategies for its widespread implementation.

The most recent available information on the COVID-19 pandemic indicated the great effect of BCG vaccine in reducing the number of COVID-19 death cases. The occurrence of death due to COVID-19 was found to be 21-fold lower in countries with a national BCG vaccination policy than in countries without such a policy, based on the medians of COVID-19 death case per 1 million of population in these two groups of countries (P<0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). Therefore, it can be concluded that the early establishment of BCG vaccination policy in any country is a key element in reducing the number of COVID-19 and tuberculosis death cases.","Jirjees, Feras J; Dallal Bashi, Yahya H; Al-Obaidi, Hala J",,,322

An accurate diagnosis of this disease in the clinic is very important. This study aims to improve the differential ability of computed tomography (CT) to diagnose COVID-19 and other community-acquired pneumonias (CAPs) and evaluate the short-term prognosis of these patients. METHODS: The clinical and imaging data of 165 COVID-19 and 118 CAP patients diagnosed in seven hospitals in Anhui Province, China from January 21 to February 28, 2020 were retrospectively analysed. The CT manifestations of the two groups were recorded and compared. A correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between COVID-19 and age, size of lung lesions, number of involved lobes, and CT findings of patients. The factors that were helpful in diagnosing the two groups of patients were identified based on specificity and sensitivity. RESULTS: The typical CT findings of COVID-19 are simple ground-glass opacities (GGO), GGO with consolidation or grid-like changes. The sensitivity and specificity of the combination of age, white blood cell count, and ground-glass opacity in the diagnosis of COVID-19 were 92.7 and 66.1%, respectively. Pulmonary consolidation, fibrous cords, and bronchial wall thickening were used as indicators to exclude COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of the combination of these findings were 78.0 and 63.6%, respectively. The follow-up results showed that 67.8% (112/165) of COVID-19 patients had abnormal changes in their lung parameters, and the severity of the pulmonary sequelae of patients over 60 years of age worsened with age. CONCLUSIONS: Age, white blood cell count and ground-glass opacity have high accuracy in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 and the differential diagnosis from CAP. Patients aged over 60 years with COVID-19 have a poor prognosis. This result provides certain significant guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia.","Liu, Kai-Cai; Xu, Ping; Lv, Wei-Fu; Chen, Lei; Qiu, Xiao-Hui; Yao, Jin-Long; Gu, Jin-Feng; Hu, Bo; Wei, Wei",Infect Dis Poverty,,322
403155,Clinical Features of Critical Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Children,2020,"The airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, has been hypothesized as one of the primary routes of transmission. Current data suggest a low probability of airborne transmission of the virus in open environments and a higher probability in closed ones, particularly in hospitals or quarantine facilities. However, the potential diffusion of the virus in open environments, especially using particulate matter (PM) as a transport carrier, generated concern in the exposed populations. Several authors found a correlation between the exceeding of the PM10 concentration limits in some Italian cities and the prevalence of Covid-19 cases detected in those areas. This study investigated the potential presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on a representative series of PM samples collected in the province of Padua in Northeastern Italy during the first wave of COVID pandemic.

417371,Optimal timing of tracheostomy in patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus 2019: a case series,2021,"Purpose of Review: Management of anaphylaxis during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic should consider local infection rates so as to not burden local ED at times of pandemic, while also protecting patients from infection risks and progression of anaphylaxis. In this review, we identify a treatment strategy for anaphylaxis that balances the risks versus benefits of ED versus home management in this unprecedented time. Recent Findings: Physicians and patients have had to adapt new approaches to medical care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic due to restricted access to health care facilities. Telemedicine has substituted in-person visits, and such a drastic change in the patient care paradigm presents a need to revise the acute management of anaphylaxis. Summary: Physicians should utilize telemedicine during this time to engage in shared decision-making with patients and their families to devise an anaphylaxis plan of management that emphasizes home care when symptoms are mild with an exception for ED care if a patient has had severe, near-fatal anaphylaxis episodes in the past. Previous anaphylaxis recommendations should remain in place despite the pandemic, including prompt use of epinephrine when needed, avoidance of known allergens, training of patients and their caregivers, and carrying of epinephrine autoinjector devices at all times to remain prepared in the event of an anaphylaxis episode.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, researchers and authorities are mainly concerned with carrying out quantitative studies (modeling and predictions) overcoming the scarcity of tests that lead us to under-reporting cases. To address these issues, we introduce a Bayesian approach to the SIR model with correction for under-reporting in the analysis of COVID-19 cases in Brazil. The proposed model was enforced to obtain estimates of important quantities such as the reproductive rate and the average infection period, along with the more likely date when the pandemic peak may occur. Several under-reporting scenarios were considered in the simulation study, showing how impacting is the lack of information in the modeling.","Soares de Oliveira, Anderson Castro; Martins Morita, Lia Hanna; Barroso da Silva, Eveliny; Ribeiro Zardo, Luiz André; Fernandes Fontes, Cor Jesus; Tita Granzotto, Daniele Cristina",,,322

A 2018 report by Alston’s office noted that at that time, approximately 40 million Americans subsisted in poverty, 18.5 million in extreme poverty, and 5.3 million in “absolute poverty” (Alston 2018).5 An outlier among its allies, the United States also has the highest rates of infant mortality and youth poverty among the member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). [...]extreme poverty persists despite the United States’ significant wealth;the UN Special Rapporteur’s report observes “a dramatic contrast between the immense wealth of the few and the squalor and deprivation in which vast numbers of Americans exist” (Alston 2018, 4). The Trump administration’s utter lack of a national public health strategy or robust relief program for the many millions suffering due to COVID-19 shows that American poverty is not accidental.

Aim: In light of the dynamic developments and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the care of people in need of long-term care the following questions arise: How do leaders of care facilities perceive the challenges, how burdened are they and how do they cope with these? METHODS: Leaders from outpatient and inpatient nursing and hospice care facilities were contacted by e-mail to participate in an online survey. Closed questions were analysed descriptively, open information was analysed by content analysis. RESULTS: From of 4,333 nursing facilities contacted, usable information was available from 525 persons. The greatest pandemic-related, interdependent challenges include concern about infections of patients and employees, procurement of protective equipment, compliance with hygiene regulations, inconsistency and lack of transparency of information and guidelines that are important for work, and loss of income and lead to a cascade of burdens. Around 40 % of respondents are uncertain whether they can cope with these. According to the respondents, the well-being and presenteeism of the leaders surveyed has deteriorated in the course of the pandemic outbreak and they appeared to be more often ill at work. Financial and structural measures, the strengthening of social cohesion and explanation were mentioned as coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The results show an increase in challenges and illustrate interdependent pandemic-related burdens. These are mainly met by overtime and additional effort, especially on the part of leaders. It remains unclear what long-term consequences are to be expected from the burden situation.","Hower, Kira Isabel; Pfaff, Holger; Pförtner, Timo-Kolja",Pflege,,322

Facing this critical situation, health care workers on the front line who are directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms including emotional disturbance. OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study will be to assess the current state of emotional responses and perceived stressors of frontline medical staffs in case of Addis Ababa COVID-19 Treatment Centers and obstetrics emergency and abortion care, Ethiopia 2020. METHODS: Hospital based comparative cross-section study design was conducted by using self-administered questionnaire survey from June 1st to 30th of 2020 among 133 and 266 frontline medical staffs from obstetric emergency and abortion care clinic and COVID-19 treatment centers respectively. The data were collected after getting written consent from each participant and it entered into the computer using Epi-data version 7, then exported to SPSS version 20 for further analysis. Descriptive analysis was done using frequencies & percent. All independent determinants with P-value < 0.05 were used to identify important predictors of emotional responses and perceived stressors. RESULT: A total of 399 frontline medical staffs were included in the study. The mean age of the respondents of those who were working in obstetrics emergency and abortion care clinic was 27.47 (SD, 3.46) years and it was 28.12 (SD, 4.09) years for the other groups. This study revealed that, 72.9 and 5.6% of the study participant from obstetrics emergency and abortion clinic and COVID-19 treatment centers had a positive emotional response, respectively. Factors such as having a low level of motivational factors (AOR 2.78, 95% CI (1.13, 6.84)), being a nurse (AOR 10.53, 95% CI (1.31, 85.26)) and working at triage (AOR 8.61, 95% CI (1.15, 64.81))) had statistically significant association with negative emotional response. CONCLUSION: The current study revealed that a high proportion of front line a negative emotional responses had negative emotional response. Further, almost all of the medical staffs working in COVID-19 treatment centers and at obstetrics emergency and abortion care unit had perceived the outbreak related stressors. So, providing comprehensive psychological support is warranted for health care providers working in such kinds of department or units.","Kebede, Mebratu Abraha; Demissie, Dereje Bayissa; Guddu, Dessalegn Kenay; Haile, Michael Temane; Bitew, Zebenay Workneh; Muleta, Mahteme Bekele",BMC Psychiatry,,322
466129,Misinformation During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak: How Knowledge Emerges From Noise,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review, conducted in April 2020, is to examine available national primary care guidelines for COVID-19 and to explore the ways in which these guidelines support primary care facilities in responding to the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Rapid review and narrative synthesis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase and Google, as well as the websites of relevant national health departments, were searched from 1 January 2020 to 24 April 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Documents included must be issued by a national health authority, must be specific to COVID-19 care, directed at healthcare workers or managers, and must refer to the role of primary care in the COVID-19 response. RESULTS: We identified 17 documents from 14 countries. An adapted framework on primary care challenges and responses to pandemic influenza framed our analysis. Guidelines generally reported on COVID-19 service delivery and mostly made specific recommendations for ensuring continued delivery of essential primary care services through telehealth or other virtual care modalities. Few offered guidance to support surveillance as a public health function. All offered guidance on implementing outbreak control measures, largely through flexible and coordinated organisational models with partners from various sectors. There was a lack of guidance to support supply chain management and practice resilience in primary care, and lack of personal protective equipment represents a serious threat to the provision of quality care during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Current national primary care guidelines for COVID-19 provide guidance on infection control and minimising the risk of spread in primary care practices, while supporting the use of new technology and coordinated partnerships. However, to ensure primary care practice resilience and quality of care are upheld, guidelines must offer recommendations on supply chain management and operational continuity, supported by adequate resources.","Haldane, Victoria; Zhang, Zhitong; Abbas, Raja Faisal; Dodd, Warren; Lau, Lincoln L; Kidd, Michael R; Rouleau, Katherine; Zou, Guanyang; Chao, Zhuo; Upshur, Ross E G; Walley, John; Wei, Xiaolin",BMJ Open,,322

Ride-pooling, where a single vehicle is shared by more than one traveller, is not only appealing for mobility platforms and their travellers, but also for promoting the sustainability of urban mobility systems. Yet, the potential of ride-pooling rides to serve as a safe and effective alternative given the personal and public health risks considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is hitherto unknown. To answer this, we combine epidemiological and behavioural shareability models to examine spreading among ride-pooling travellers, with an application for Amsterdam. Findings are at first sight devastating, with only few initially infected travellers needed to spread the virus to hundreds of ride-pooling users. Without intervention, ride-pooling system may substantially contribute to virus spreading. Notwithstanding, we identify an effective control measure allowing to halt the spreading before the outbreaks (at 50 instead of 800 infections) without sacrificing the efficiency achieved by pooling. Fixed matches among co-travellers disconnect the otherwise dense contact network, encapsulating the virus in small communities and preventing the outbreaks.","Kucharski, Rafal; Cats, Oded; Sienkiewicz, Julian",Sci Rep,,322

Despite the recent surge of investigations about different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we still know little about the effects of city size on the propagation of this disease in urban areas. Here we investigate how the number of cases and deaths by COVID-19 scale with the population of Brazilian cities. Our results indicate that large cities are proportionally more affected by COVID-19, such that every 1% rise in population is associated with 0.57% increase in the number of cases per capita and 0.25% in the number of deaths per capita. The difference between the scaling of cases and deaths indicates the case fatality rate decreases with city size. The latest estimates show that a 1% increase in population associates with a 0.14% reduction in the case fatality rate of COVID-19; however, this urban advantage has decreased over time. We interpret this to be due to the existence of proportionally more health infrastructure in the largest cities and a lower proportion of older adults in large urban areas. We also find the initial growth rate of cases and deaths to be higher in large cities; however, these growth rates tend to decrease in large cities and to increase in small ones during the long-term course of the pandemic.","Ribeiro, Haroldo V.; Sunahara, Andre S.; Sutton, Jack; Perc, Matjaz; Hanley, Quentin S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13892v1.pdf,322

472954,Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation and Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Since the beginning of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States, there have been concerns about the potential impact of the pandemic on persons with opioid use disorder. Shelter-in-place (SIP) orders, which aimed to reduce the spread and scope of the virus, likely also impacted this patient population. This study aims to assess the role of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of opioid overdose before and after a SIP order. METHODS: A retrospective review of the incidence of opioid overdoses in an urban three-hospital system was conducted. Comparisons were made between the first 100 days of a city-wide SIP order during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 100 days during the COVID-19 pandemic preceding the SIP order (Pre-SIP). Differences in observed incidence and expected incidence during the SIP period were evaluated using a Fisher's Exact test. RESULTS: Total patient visits decreased 22% from 46,078 during the Pre-SIP period to 35,971 during the SIP period. A total of 1551 opioid overdoses were evaluated during the SIP period, compared to 1665 opioid overdoses during the Pre-SIP period, consistent with a 6.8% decline. A Fisher's Exact Test demonstrated a p < 0.0001, with a corresponding Odds Ratio of 1.20 with a 95% confidence interval (1.12;1.29). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated SIP order were associated with a statistically and clinically significant increase in the proportion of opioid overdoses in relation to the overall change in total ED visits.","Rosenbaum, Jennifer; Lucas, Nicole; Zandrow, Gregory; Satz, Wayne A; Isenberg, Derek; D039,; Orazio, Joseph; Gentile, Nina T; Schreyer, Kraftin E",Am J Emerg Med,,322
475922,Clinical Course and Outcome of COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Data From a National Repository,2021,"The pandemic COVID-2019 has been an unexpected challenge for the economies of many countries. In order to avoid the rapid spread of the disease, the governments of most countries imposed quarantine, forcibly closed borders, imposed restrictions on the movement of the population, and so on. Obviously, this provoked instability in financial markets, sharp fluctuations in national exchange rates and worsened the economic expectations of the population. In the scientific article, the authors conducted a study of the deposit policy of Ukrainian banks in this economic instability, which was provoked by the COVID-2019 pandemic. Based on statistical data, the structure of deposits of legal entities and individuals, the dynamics of interest rates, the regional distribution of deposits, as well as identified the leading banks to raise funds. The authors obtained unexpected conclusions about the lack of significant impact of the pandemic on the deposit market. Despite all the negative forecasts, there was no significant outflow of deposits in Ukraine, rather the opposite - banks were able to increase the amount of funds raised from individuals and legal entities. However, the negative expectations of the population affected the structure of deposit resources, in particular, in the analyzed period the share of demand deposits and short-term deposits increased significantly. Based on the analysis of experts' opinions, as well as the forecast of the main economic indicators that have an impact on the deposit market, three scenarios for further development of Ukraine's economy and the banking sector were developed and substantiated - optimistic, critical and realistic. According to the authors, the most reasonable in these conditions may be a realistic scenario that will provide positive dynamics in the growth of basic economic indicators, which will affect the growth of deposit resources in banks, while taking into account potential non-economic risks that could destabilize the situation. The findings can be applied in developing strategies for the development of individual banks and the banking system as a whole.","Fostyak, V.; Ya, T.; Druhova, V.; Alieksieiev, I.; Bondarchuk, M.",Financial and Credit Activity-Problems of Theory and Practice,,322

480470,Skeletal muscles injury related to sars-cov-2 infection: A case report,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious illness that spreads rapidly through human-to-human transmission. On March 5, the government of Palestine declared a state of emergency in order to curb the spread of the virus, a declaration that it extended for a fifth time on July 5th. The degree to which a population complies with corresponding safety measures is surely affected by the people's knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards the disease. To explore this hypothesis, we gathered data from 1,731 Palestinians between April 19thand May 1st, 2020 through a KAP questionnaire. The participant pool represented a stratified sample of Palestinians living across a number of governorates in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, with 36.5% from Gaza and (63.5%) from the West Bank. Gender was almost equally distributed within the sample with (51%) men respondents and (49%) women respondent. The questionnaire included 17 questions about participants' knowledge and awareness of COVID-19, 17 questions regarding the safety measures they had taken in the wake of the outbreak and 3 questions asking them to assess the efficacy of the government's response to the pandemic. Our data shows that 79% of the respondents have good awareness about transmission of the virus, 55.6% were knowledgeable of the symptoms exhibited by an infected individual, 81% were aware of the preventative measures and 82% demonstrated awareness of the risk groups. Most participants complied with preventative measures (77%) and 62% the study participants agreed that stricter measures have to be enforced by the government to limit the spread of the virus. Our study revealed that younger participants and people with higher educational level demonstrated more awareness of the virus. Also, Women were reported to be more aware of preventative measures and to have complied more with good practices. We report that residents of the West Bank have complied more with the right practices when compared to residents of Gaza. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that health education programs aimed at improving the public's understanding of COVID-19 are important in helping the population maintain appropriate practices and should be target people with lower educational level, and that findings such as those discussed in this report may provide valuable feedback to lawmakers working to stop the spread of the virus.","Qutob, Nouar; Awartani, Faisal",PLoS One,,322

482158,High flow nasal cannula oxygenation in COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome: a safe way to avoid endotracheal intubation?,2021,"Background: Thyroid cancer is a very common endocrine cancer worldwide. How long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) regulates thyroid cancer is elusive. LncRNA MFI2-AS1 has been demonstrated to initiate colorectal cancer. Nevertheless, the role of MFI2-AS1 in thyroid cancer remains unknown. This study aims to determine the roles of MFI2-AS1 in thyroid cancer. Methods: qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression of MFI2-AS1 in thyroid cancer tissues and cells. Proliferation was determined by using CCK8 and colony formation assays. Transwell assay was utilized to analyze migration and invasion. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the interaction between MFI2-AS1 and miR-125a-5p. Results: MFI2-AS1 was shown to be highly expressed in thyroid cancer tissues and predicted poor prognosis. Knockdown of MFI2-AS1 inhibited proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells in vitro. Bioinformatics screening identified MFI2-AS1 as the sponge for miR-125a-5p. And miR-125a-5p was further confirmed to target TRIAP1 directly. Our data further demonstrated that MFI2-AS1 promoted TRIAP1 expression via repressing miR-125a-5p. Finally, TRIAP1 was found to be upregulated in thyroid cancer tissues and its restoration reversed the effects of MFI2-AS1 depletion. Conclusion: Our results elucidated a novel mechanism that MFI2-AS1 promotes thyroid cancer progression via the miR-125a-5p/TRIAP1 pathway.","Yu, Tianyu; Tong, Lingling; Ao, Yu; Zhang, Genmao; Liu, Yunpeng; Zhang, Hejia",Onco Targets Ther,,322
483595,Acute Limb Ischemia Due to Arterial Thrombosis Associated With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: Viral pandemics have had catastrophic consequences on population health and economies. The Philippine government intends to establish the Virology Institute of the Philippines, one of the key areas of which will be virology research. This project aimed to develop the institute's research agenda across the fields of human, plant, and animal virology. METHODOLOGY: Key considerations for the prioritization methodology were (1) the imminent establishment of the Virology Institute of the Philippines, (2) mobility restrictions caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, (3) the timeline to develop the research agenda, and (4) the need to separate the research agenda for the three fields of human, plant, and animal virology. The process was fully conducted online in four steps: stakeholder identification, soliciting research priorities, generating initial research priorities, and final prioritization consultations conducted on Zoom Pro. RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants attended three online consultations between 21 and 27 July 2020 through Zoom Pro. Participants selected the research prioritization criteria and its weights, and used these to evaluate the research priorities. The final research agenda covers topics in epidemiology, diagnostics, surveillance, biosafety, and genomics. CONCLUSION: This initiative resulted in the first research agenda for the Virology Institute of the Philippines across the three fields of human, plant, and animal virology. An expert-driven process which places a premium on consensus-building facilitated through online platforms was the most feasible approach to develop the research agenda. This process resulted in an agenda aligned with the mandates of national research councils but leaves gaps on areas such as emerging infectious diseases. Pre-COVID-19 literature expressed apprehensions on the online medium that weakens social ties necessary for consensus. Our experience with changing the mode of consensus-building shows that users will continually adapt to technology. Online tools are currently able to address the limitations of the virtual space.","Sales, R. K.; Orano, J.; Estanislao, R. D.; Ballesteros, A. J.; Gomez, M. I.

We analyzed publicly available RNA microarray datasets for SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors and cofactors ACE2, TMPRSS2, BSG (CD147) and FURIN. We found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are upregulated in the airways of smokers. In asthmatics, ACE2 tended to be downregulated in nasal epithelium, and TMPRSS2 was upregulated in the bronchi. Furthermore, respiratory epithelia were negative for ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 protein expression while positive for BSG and furin, suggesting a possible alternative entry route for SARS-CoV-2.","Matusiak, Magdalena; Schürch, Christian M",Respir Res,,322

489703,Compliance Phenotypes in Early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome before the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, is shed in stool. SARS coronaviruses have been detected in wastewater during outbreaks in China, Europe, and the United States. In this perspective, we outline the risk fecal shedding poses at locations without safely managed sanitation, as in most of Nigeria where we work. We believe that feco-oral transmission could occur if community transmission becomes high and sustained in densely populated cities without proper sanitation in Nigeria and many other African and Asian settings. In the absence of basic sanitation, or where existing sanitation is not safely managed, groundwater, which is often drawn up from wells and boreholes for drinking and household use, can become contaminated with enteric bacteria and viruses from fecal matter. Endemic and epidemic transmission of multiple feco-oral pathogens via this route continues to be documented in areas without safely managed sanitation, and, therefore, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission needs to be evaluated, tracked, and forestalled in such settings. We suggest that fecal matter from treatment facilities and recovered patients should be carefully and properly disposed. Furthermore, environmental surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and accumulated human waste, as well as efforts to mitigate the virus' entry into unprotected household water sources, should be a priority part of the COVID-19 response in settings without safely managed sanitation for the duration of the pandemic.","Odih, Erkison E; Afolayan, Ayorinde O; Akintayo, IfeOluwa; Okeke, Iruka N",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,322

495048,Biological Mechanisms of COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2020,"The COVID-19 outbreak has had a dramatic impact on the healthcare system due to the rapid, worldwide spread of the virus, highlighting several considerations on the best management of infected patients and also potential risks and prognostic factors in patients with pre-existing chronic diseases exposed to the virus. Neurodegenerative disorders are known to be chronic, disabling diseases that imply a higher vulnerability to infections, and for this reason, it has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have a worse course in these patients. In the present study, we report our experience with 12 patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) who became infected with SARS-Cov-2 due to a COVID-19 outbreak in a care residency, and thus hospitalised in our COVID hospital. Most of the PD patients had a long disease duration and multiple comorbidities even though SARS-CoV-2 manifestations were mild, and none required intensive care. Despite lung conditions, most of our PD patients had mild symptoms: 7 patients were clinically asymptomatic (58.3%); 3 patients had fever, cough, and myalgia (25%) and 2 patients had dyspnoea (16%) that needed high-flow oxygen therapy. Few complications related to PD were seen. All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalisation period of 30 days. Mortality rate during hospitalisation was zero. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection does not have a poor prognosis in patients with PD. More extensive data and evaluations, however, are needed to confirm our data, and caution is warranted.","Buccafusca, Maria; Micali, Cristina; Autunno, Massimo; Versace, Antonio Giovanni; Nunnari, Giuseppe; Musumeci, Olimpia",Neurol Sci,,322

The Italian ColoRectal Anastomotic Leakage (iCral) study group collecting 43 Italian surgical centers experienced in colorectal surgery from multiple regions performed a quick survey to make a snapshot of the current situation. METHODS: A 25-items questionnaire was sent to the 43 principal investigators of the iCral study group, with questions regarding qualitative and quantitative aspects of the surgical activity before and after the COVID19 outbreak. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the centers were involved in the treatment of COVID19 cases. Intensive care units (ICU) beds were partially or totally reallocated for the treatment of COVID19 cases in 72% of the hospitals. Elective colorectal surgery for malignancy was stopped or delayed in nearly 30% of the centers, with less than 20% of them still scheduling elective colorectal resections for frail and comorbid patients needing postoperative ICU care. A significant reduction of the number of colorectal resections during the time span from January to March 2020 was recorded, with significant delay in treatment in more than 50% of the centers. DISCUSSION: Our survey confirms that COVID19 outbreak is severely affecting the activity of colorectal surgery centers participating to iCral study group. This could impact the activity of surgical centers for many months after the end of the emergency.","Caricato, Marco; Baiocchi, Gian Luca; Crafa, Francesco; Scabini, Stefano; Brisinda, Giuseppe; Clementi, Marco; Sica, Giuseppe; Delrio, Paolo; Longo, Graziano; Anania, Gabriele; de Manzini, Nicolò; Amodio, Pietro; Lucchi, Andrea; Baldazzi, Gianandrea; Garulli, Gianluca; Patriti, Alberto; Pirozzi, Felice; Pavanello, Maurizio; Carrara, Alessandro; Campagnacci, Roberto; Liverani, Andrea; Muratore, Andrea; Siquini, Walter; De Luca, Raffaele; Mancini, Stefano; Borghi, Felice; Di Cosmo, Mariantonietta; Persiani, Roberto; Pedrazzani, Corrado; Scaramuzzi, Matteo; Scatizzi, Marco; Vettoretto, Nereo; Totis, Mauro; Gennai, Andrea; Marini, Pierluigi; Basti, Massimo; Viola, Massimo; Ruffo, Giacomo; Catarci, Marco",Updates Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-020-00760-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32436016/,322

AIM: We aimed to investigate whether hemoglobin drop was associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted by review of the medical records of 6,683 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in the Mount Sinai Health system between March 1(st), 2020 and March 30(th) 2021. We compared patients with and without hemoglobin drop >3 g/dL during hospitalization within a week after admissions, using inverse probability treatment weighted analysis (IPTW). Outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and AKI which was defined as serum creatine change of 0.3 mg/dL increase or 1.5 times baseline. RESULTS: Of the 6,683 patients admitted due to COVID-19, 750 (11.2%) patients presented with a marked hemoglobin drop. Patients with hemoglobin drop were more likely to receive therapeutic anticoagulation within two days after admissions. Patients with hemoglobin drop had higher crude in-hospital mortality (40.8% versus 20.0%, P < 0.001) as well as AKI (51.4% versus 23.9%, P < 0.001) compared to those without.

601093,Quality of life following adult veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review,2021-04-07,"Abstract After intranasal inoculation, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) gains entry into the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. Under the appropriate conditions, some mice develop clinically apparent demyelinating encephalomyelitis several weeks later, with virus always present in the spinal cord. To determine the pathway by which virus reaches the cord, brains and spinal cords of infected, asymptomatic mice were analyzed by in situ hybridization. Viral RNA was always detected in the anterior part of the upper spinal cord. A similar analysis of mice with the recent onset of hindlimb weakness showed that viral RNA was detected in the same location. The results suggest that MHV is transported to the spinal cord via well-defined neuroanatomic pathways and that viral amplification with resultant clinical disease occurs from this site of persistence in the anterior spinal cord. This process of viral amplification may involve the generation of viral variants as has been described for MHV-infected rats. No major changes in viral RNA or protein could be detected when MHV isolated from mice with hindlimb paralysis was analyzed. The data suggest that the generation of viral variants is not important in the pathogenesis of the late onset neurological disease induced by MHV in mice.","Perlman, Stanley; Jacobsen, Gary; Olson, Ann Louise; Afifi, Adel",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229090426R; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2158180/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229090426R,322

In our multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial, patients with wind-cold type common cold received 0.6 g of Shi-cha capsule plus 0.6 g placebo (group A), 1.2 g of Shi-cha capsule (group B), or 1.2 g placebo (group C), three times daily for 3 days and followed up to 10 days. The primary end point was all symptom duration. The secondary end points were main symptom duration, minor symptom duration, the changes in cumulative symptom score, main symptom score, and minor symptom score 4 days after the treatment, as well as adverse events. A total of 377 patients were recruited and 360 met the inclusive criteria; 120 patients constituted each treatment group. Compared with patients in group C, patients in groups A and B had significant improvement in the all symptom duration, main symptom duration, minor symptom duration, as well as change from baseline of cumulative symptom score, main symptom score, and minor symptom score at day 4. The symptom durations and scores showed slight superiority of group B over group A, although these differences were not statistically significant. There were no differences in adverse events. The Shi-cha capsule is efficacious and safe for the treatment of patients with wind-cold type common cold. Larger trials are required to fully assess the benefits and safety of this treatment for common cold.","Chang, Jing; Dong, Shou-Jin; She, Bin; Zhang, Rui-Ming; Meng, Mao-Bin; Xu, Yan-Ling; Wan, Li-Ling; Shi, Ke-Hua; Pan, Jun-Hun; Mao, Bing",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/254571; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23346193/,322

615553,Correlation of Respiratory Physiologic Parameters in Mechanically Ventilated Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients,2021-01-13,"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a virus that causes severe viral pneumonia in humans, known to have a high mortality rate and a similarity in clinical symptoms with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012 and after that, MERS-CoV exhibited outbreaks in several regions of the world. This study aimed to assess the characteristics of publications involving MERS-CoV at global level by using a bibliometric analysis. METHODS: Scopus database was searched on March 4, 2016 for MERS-CoV publications published between 2012 and 2015. It was performed on the same day in order to avoid the possible bias came from update on the database because the metrics are changing over time. All publication types were considered; however publications as errata were excluded. Analysis parameters include year of publication, publication type, patterns of international collaboration, research institutions, journals, impact factor, h-index, language, and times cited. RESULTS: A total of 883 MERS-CoV research publications were published across the world. The MERS-CoV-associated publications were originated from 92 countries/territories, indicating the international spread of MERS-CoV research. The USA was the largest contributor, with 319 articles published over 4 years, followed by KSA (113 articles). The total number of citations for these publications has already achieved 8,015, with an average of 9.01 citations per each publication. The h-index for MERS-CoV-associated publications was 48. The USA also have the highest h-index (32), followed by KSA (26) and UK (22). Netherland produced the greatest proportion of publications with international research collaboration (72.7 %) followed by the UK (71 %) and Germany (69.1 %) out of the total number of publications for each country. CONCLUSIONS: There is a rapid increase in research activities related to MERS-CoV from 2012 to 2015. This study demonstrates that the MERS-CoV related literature has grown to be more extensive and global over the past 4 years. The bulk of publications in the field of MERS-CoV research are published by high-income countries such as the USA. Furthermore, the USA, the UK and KSA may have higher quality of articles according to the value of h-index.","Zyoud, Sa’ed H.",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-1600-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27267256/,322

A series of strict prevention and control measures were implemented in China, contributing to the improvement of air quality. In this study, we described the trend of air pollutant concentrations and the incidence of COVID-19 during the epidemic and applied generalized additive models (GAMs) to assess the association between short-term exposure to air pollution and daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 235 Chinese cities. Disease progression based on both onset and report dates as well as control measures as potential confounding were considered in the analyses. We found that stringent prevention and control measures intending to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, contributed to a significant decline in the concentrations of air pollutants except ozone (O(3)). Significant positive associations of short-term exposure to air pollutants, including particulate matter with diameters ≤2.5μm (PM(2.5)), particulate matter with diameters ≤10μm (PM(10)), and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) with daily new confirmed cases were observed during the epidemic. Per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM(2.5) (lag0-15), PM(10) (lag0-15), and NO(2) (lag0-20) were associated with a 7% [95% confidence interval (CI): (4 - 9)], 6% [95% CI: (3 - 8)], and 19% [95% CI: (13 - 24)] increase in the counts of daily onset cases, respectively. Our results suggest that there is a statistically significant association between ambient air pollution and the spread of COVID-19. Thus, the quarantine measures can not only cut off the transmission of virus, but also retard the spread by improving ambient air quality, which might provide implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19.","Zhang, Xinhan; Tang, Mengling; Guo, Fanjia; Wei, Fang; Yu, Zhebin; Gao, Kai; Jin, Mingjuan; Wang, Jianbing; Chen, Kun",Environ Pollut,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749120365866?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33126032/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0269749120365866; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115897,322

635338,Outcomes of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in COVID-19 Patients: A Propensity-Matched Analysis,2021-06-09,"BACKGROUND: Multiple SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events suggest that aerosols play an important role in driving the COVID-19 pandemic. To better understand how airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs, we sought to determine viral loads within coarse (>5μm) and fine (≤5μm) respiratory aerosols produced when breathing, talking, and singing. METHODS: Using a G-II exhaled breath collector, we measured viral RNA in coarse and fine respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients during 30 minutes of breathing, 15 minutes of talking, and 15 minutes of singing. RESULTS: Thirteen participants (59%) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols, including 3 asymptomatic and 1 presymptomatic patient. Viral loads ranged from 63–5,821 N gene copies per expiratory activity per participant, with high person-to-person variation. Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable RNA. Two participants, sampled on day 3 of illness, accounted for 52% of the total viral load. Overall, 94% of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies were emitted by talking and singing. Interestingly, 7 participants emitted more virus from talking than singing. Overall, fine aerosols constituted 85% of the viral load detected in our study. Virus cultures were negative. CONCLUSIONS: Fine aerosols produced by talking and singing contain more SARS-CoV-2 copies than coarse aerosols and may play a significant role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Exposure to fine aerosols, especially indoors, should be mitigated. Isolating viable SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory aerosol samples remains challenging, and whether this can be more easily accomplished for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is an urgent enquiry necessitating larger-scale studies.","Coleman, Kristen K; Tay, Douglas Jie Wen; Sen Tan, Kai; Ong, Sean Wei Xiang; Son, Than The; Koh, Ming Hui; Chin, Yi Qing; Nasir, Haziq; Mak, Tze Minn; Chu, Justin Jang Hann; Milton, Donald K; Chow, Vincent T K; Tambyah, Paul Anantharajah; Chen, Mark; Wai, Tham Kwok",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34358292/,322

Pulmonary rehabilitation is aimed to improve dyspnoea, relieve anxiety and depression, reduce the incidence of related complications, as well as prevent and improve dysfunction. However, the impact of respiratory rehabilitation on discharged patients with COVID-19 is currently unclear, especially on patients who have been mechanically ventilated over 24 hours. Therefore, we aim to investigate the efficacy of respiratory rehabilitation programmes, initiated after discharge from the intensive care unit, on the physical and mental health and health-related quality of life in critical patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We have registered the protocol on PROSPERO and in the process of drafting it, we strictly followed the checklist of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Potocols. We will search the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, VIP information databases and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database. Additionally, ongoing trials in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov and ISRCTN registry will be searched as well. Studies in English or Chinese and from any country will be accepted regardless of study design. Two review authors will independently extract data and assess the quality of included studies. Continuous data are described as standard mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs. Dichotomous data from randomised controlled trials are described as risk ratio(RR) with 95% CIs; otherwise, it is described as odds ratio(OR) with 95% CIs.

638586,Misinformation During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak: How Knowledge Emerges From Noise,2020-04-29,"Trionyx sinensis Hemorrhagic Syndrome Virus (TSHSV) is an arterivirus newly discovered in Chinese softshell turtles. Little is known about the effect of antibodies against the virus or the distribution of the virus in different organs of infected turtles. In this study, a partial protein of TSHSV-HP4 was produced using a prokaryotic expression system, and its polyclonal antibody was generated. The polyclonal antibody was confirmed by western blot and dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA). The distribution of TSHSV in different organs of T. sinensis was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the expression of immune-related genes was analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results indicated that the recombinant TSHSV-HP4 protein was successfully expressed, and the generated polyclonal antibody showed specific binding to viral particles in the lung tissues of infected turtles. The IHC assay indicated that the virus was highly localized in various cells, including intestinal lymphocytes, enterocytes, kidney epithelial cells, spleen cells, lung macrophages, and cardiomyocytes. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that TSHSV was detected in all organs tested, including the lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, and heart. The numbers of viral mRNA copies in lung and heart tissues were significantly higher in the virus-antibody group than in the virus group. The interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), myxovirus resistance protein 2 (MX2) and radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 (RSAD2) were highly upregulated in all groups of infected turtles. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) seemed to occur after stimulation by the polyclonal antibody, because significantly greater expression of the two genes was detected in the virus-antibody group than in the virus group. Overall, these results are important in understanding the cell localization of TSHSV and the immune response of infected turtles.","Lyu, Sunjian; Yuan, Xuemei; Liu, Li; Zhang, Haiqi; Yu, Zhe; Hang, Xiaoying; Shi, Weida; Wu, Yinglei",J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33835763/; https://doi.org/10.1631/jzus.b2000504,322

Were there ways to have avoided the trauma faced by nurses (International Council of Nurses, ICN, 2021) after the overexposure to the health care crisis?Such a grim realization has specific implications for nursing. Naturally, one cannot change the world. Similarly, nurses cannot affect all aspects of health care systems that need serious reform. But nurses can affect nursing‐sensitive outcomes. Most importantly, nursing‐sensitive outcomes can be used to establish criteria for safe nursing practice. Health care institutions must enable health care professionals to function within the scope of their professional ethical codes. After all, systems operate thanks to the professionals comprising them. Similarly, professionals need to be facilitated by systems to function with integrity.","Kyranou, Maria",J Nurs Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33998723/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13374,322

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and patient engagement with a smartphone app designed for heart failure. METHODS: Patients with heart failure were randomized to intervention (smartphone with the Habits Heart App installed and Bluetooth-linked scale) or control (paper education material) groups. All intervention group patients were interviewed and monitored closely for app feasibility while receiving standard of care heart failure management by cardiologists. The Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test, a quality of life survey (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire), and weight were assessed at baseline and final visits. RESULTS: Patients (N=28 patients; intervention: n=15; control: n=13) with heart failure (with reduced ejection fraction: 15/28, 54%; male: 20/28, 71%, female: 8/28, 29%; median age 63 years) were enrolled, and 82% of patients (N=23; intervention: 12/15, 80%; control: 11/13, 85%) completed both baseline and final visits (median follow up 60 days). In the intervention group, 2 out of the 12 patients who completed the study did not use the app after study onboarding due to illnesses and hospitalizations. Of the remaining 10 patients who used the app, 5 patients logged ≥1 interaction with the app per day on average, and 2 patients logged an interaction with the app every other day on average. The intervention group averaged 403 screen views (per patient) in 56 distinct sessions, 5-minute session durations, and 22 weight entries per patient. There was a direct correlation between duration of app use and improvement in heart failure knowledge (Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test score; ρ=0.59, P=.04) and quality of life (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score; ρ=0.63, P=.03). The correlation between app use and weight change was ρ=–0.40 (P=.19). Only 1 out of 11 patients in the control group retained education material by the follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: The Habits Heart App with a Bluetooth-linked scale is a feasible way to engage patients in heart failure management, and barriers to app engagement were identified.

As of May 30, 2020, a total of 84 568 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been recorded in China, with a mortality rate of approximately 5.5%. Taizhou is a prefecture-level city in Zhejiang Province. A total of 146 cases were diagnosed in this epidemic, with a fatality rate of 0%. This condition is due to the establishment of an “Internet +” diagnosis and treatment model based on online medical application (APP), telemedicine, WeChat service, and consultation hotline in Taizhou. Taizhou led in opening the “COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment Special Line” in China, which is conducive to pre-hospital screening, suppressing social panic, and clinical support. Hospitals also carried out related online lectures and popularization of science. We summarize Taizhou’s COVID-19 prevention and control experience with telemedicine features, with a view to providing reference for the control of the epidemic at home and abroad.","Shao, Cenyi; Li, Shijian; Zhu, Feng; Zhao, Dahai; Shao, Hui; Chen, Haixiao; Zhang, Zhiruo",Front Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11684-020-0811-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32862396/,322
666740,Candidaemia incidence in prolonged veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.,2021-09-22,"Upon viral infection, host cells mount a concerted innate immune response involving type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines to enable elimination of the pathogen. Recently cGAS and STING have been identified as intracellular sensors that activate the interferon pathway in response to virus infection and thus mediate host defense against a range of DNA and RNA viruses. Here we review how viruses are sensed by the cGAS-STING signaling pathway as well as how viruses modulate this pathway. Mechanisms utilized by viral proteins to inhibit cGAS and/or STING are also discussed. On the flip side, host cells have also evolved strategies to thwart viral immune escape. The balance between host immune control and viral immune evasion is pivotal to viral pathogenesis and we discuss this virus-host stand-off in the context of the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway.","Ma, Zhe; Damania, Blossom",Cell Host & Microbe,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312816300099; http://www.cell.com/article/S1931312816300099/pdf; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2016.01.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312816300099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26867174/,322
668119,Latent class analysis to predict intensive care outcomes in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: a proposal of two pulmonary phenotypes,2021-04-22,"In the United Kingdom, undergraduate students from Black, Asian and other minority ethnic backgrounds receive lower classes of degrees than white students, and similar gaps have been reported in other countries. Such award gaps limit ethnic diversity in academic research, and in the broader job market. Whilst there has been some success in reducing the award gap in the UK, a significant gap still persists. Here, based on an analysis of students studying cell biology at University College London, I show that differences in performance at exams contribute significantly more to the award gap than differences in performance in coursework. From these data, plus scrutiny of the literature, alternative policies are identified to speed up the closure of the award gap and to remove the barriers that prevent students from Black, Asian and other minority ethnic backgrounds from progressing to PhD and postdoctoral positions.","Cramer, Louise",eLife,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34344502/; https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.58971,322

677011,Proposal for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Management,2020-05-12,"In 2020 the whole world focused on antivirus drugs towards SARS-CoV-2. Most of the researchers focused on drugs used in other viral infections or malaria. We have not seen such mobilization towards one topic in this century. The whole situation makes clear that progress needs to be made in antiviral drug development. The first step to do it is to characterize the potential antiviral activity of new or already existed drugs on the market. Phenothiazines are antipsychotic agents used previously as antiseptics, anthelminthics, and antimalarials. Up to date, they are tested for a number of other disorders including the broad spectrum of viruses. The goal of this paper was to summarize the current literature on activity toward RNA-viruses of such drugs like chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and thioridazine. We identified 49 papers, where the use of the phenothiazines for 23 viruses from different families were tested. Chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and thioridazine possess anti-viral activity towards different types of viruses. These drugs inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis, cell-cell fusion, infection, replication of the virus, decrease viral invasion as well as suppress entry into the host cells. Additionally, since the drugs display activity at nontoxic concentrations they have therapeutic potential for some viruses, still, further research on animal and human subjects are needed in this field to verify cell base research.","Otręba, Michał; Kośmider, Leon; Rzepecka-Stojko, Anna",Eur J Pharmacol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299920306452; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299920306452?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173553; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32949606/,322
678702,SUBLINGUAL MICROCIRCULATION IN PATIENTS WITH SARS-CoV-2 UNDERGOING VENO-VENOUS EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRANE OXYGENATION,2020-08-22,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in conjunctival secretions from patients without ocular symptoms. METHODS: Conjunctival swabs were prospectively collected from laboratory-confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients without ocular symptoms for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culture. RESULTS: A total of 158 conjunctival swabs were obtained from 49 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. The median duration of illness when the first conjunctival swab was obtained was 10 days (range 2–27 days). Four conjunctival swabs from four different patients (4/49, 8.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. The Ct values ranged from 32.7 to 37.7 (mean 35.4). Viral cultures were negative for all four RT-PCR-positive conjunctival swabs. CONCLUSION: Conjunctival secretions of a minority of COVID-19 patients without ocular symptoms may contain relatively low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but their infectiousness remains undetermined. Appropriate infection control measures should be implemented during ophthalmological assessment of COVID-19 patients to prevent potential nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Li, Xin; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Li, Kenneth Kai-Wang; Tso, Eugene Yuk-Keung; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Sridhar, Siddharth; Chung, Tom Wai-Hin; Chiu, Kelvin Hei-Yeung; Hung, Derek Ling-Lung; Wu, Alan Ka-Lun; Chau, Sandy Ka-Yee; Liu, Raymond; Lung, Kwok-Cheung; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Infection,https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-020-01524-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32944840/,322

This method involved bilingual participants completing both measures in four conditions. For two groups of people, measures were offered in the same language both times and for the other two groups, each language version was offered, the order differing between the groups. The measures were the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure and the Schwartz Outcome Scale-10, both originally created in English and then translated to Spanish. In total, 109 bilingual participants (69.7% women) completed the measures in two occasions and were randomly allocated to the four conditions (English-English, English-Spanish, Spanish-English and Spanish-Spanish). Linear mixed effects models were performed to provide a formal null hypothesis test of the effect of language, order of completion and their interaction for each measure. The results indicate that for the total score of the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure just language had a significant effect, but no significant effects were found for completion order or the language by order interaction. For the Schwartz Outcome Scale-10 scores, none of these effects were statistically significant. This method offers some clear advantages over the more prevalent psychometric methods of testing score comparability across measure translations.","Paz, Clara; Hermosa-Bosano, Carlos; Evans, Chris",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248794/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.688397,322
