7517,Le syndrome Respiratoire Aigu Sévère (SRAS). Première épidémie du XXI(e) siècle,2019-07-17,"Fast and slow axonal transport of protein have been studied in the optic nerves of mice infected with Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) that causes patchy demyelination throughout the CNS. Intravitreal injections of [(3)H]proline were given at regular intervals after virus inoculation, the labelled protein in the superior colliculi was then measured after survival periods of 18 h or 10 days, for fast and slow axonal transport studies, respectively. Fast transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein arriving at the optic nerve terminals (superior colliculus) of the SFV-infected mice prior to the onset of demyelination. In contrast, the slow transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein at the superior colliculus of the SFV-infected mice during the demyelination period. There was no concomitant increase in labelled protein in the retina at any time after the SFV infection. It is proposed that alteration in the transport of the protein constituents other than major myelin specific components may cause disruption of myelin maintenance in SFV infection.","Tansey, E.M.; Ikeda, Hisako",Brain Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7111164/,539
10861,Primum non nocere,2020-05-11,"ABSTRACT: Indole derivatives have been the focus of many researchers in the study of pharmaceutical compounds for many years. Researchers have investigated the effect of carboxamide moiety at positions 2 and 3, giving unique inhibitory properties to these compounds. The presence of carboxamide moiety in indole derivatives causes hydrogen bonds with a variety of enzymes and proteins, which in many cases, inhibits their activity. In this review, synthetic strategies of indole 2 and 3-carboxamide derivatives, the type, and mode of interaction of these derivatives against HLGP, HIV-1, renin enzyme, and structure–activity studies of these compounds were investigated. It is hoped that indole scaffolds will be tested in the future for maximum activity in pharmacological compounds.

17980,"Le concept « One Health », une seule santé : réalité et perspectives",2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of body fluids is an emerging approach to identify occult pathogens in undiagnosed patients. We hypothesized that metagenomic testing can be simultaneously used to detect malignant neoplasms in addition to infectious pathogens. METHODS: From two independent studies (n = 205), we used human data generated from a metagenomic sequencing pipeline to simultaneously screen for malignancies by copy number variation (CNV) detection. In the first case-control study, we analyzed body fluid samples (n = 124) from patients with a clinical diagnosis of either malignancy (positive cases, n = 65) or infection (negative controls, n = 59). In a second verification cohort, we analyzed a series of consecutive cases (n = 81) sent to cytology for malignancy workup that included malignant positives (n = 32), negatives (n = 18), or cases with an unclear gold standard (n = 31). RESULTS: The overall CNV test sensitivity across all studies was 87% (55 of 63) in patients with malignancies confirmed by conventional cytology and/or flow cytometry testing and 68% (23 of 34) in patients who were ultimately diagnosed with cancer but negative by conventional testing. Specificity was 100% (95% CI 95–100%) with no false positives detected in 77 negative controls. In one example, a patient hospitalized with an unknown pulmonary illness had non-diagnostic lung biopsies, while CNVs implicating a malignancy were detectable from bronchoalveolar fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomic sequencing of body fluids can be used to identify undetected malignant neoplasms through copy number variation detection. This study illustrates the potential clinical utility of a single metagenomic test to uncover the cause of undiagnosed acute illnesses due to cancer or infection using the same specimen.

23418,SRAS – Syndrome Respiratoire Aigu Sévère,2019-07-17,"BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) patients are at increased risk of respiratory viral infections (RVIs) due to disease-related alterations in their immune systems. Data in the literature specific to MM patients is limited. We reviewed four years of multiplex respiratory viral panel (RVP) data in MM patients at our institution to evaluate incidence and seasonality of RVIs. methods. The results from all positive RVPs, obtained via nasopharyngeal swab and as identified by polymerase chain reaction during the years 2013 to 2016, were analyzed. A positive result less than 6 weeks apart was considered a duplicate and removed. All specimens were analyzed in the molecular diagnostics laboratory using the eSensor® Respiratory Viral Panel (GenMark Dx, Carlsbad, CA). This assay is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex in vitro diagnostic test that provides for the simultaneous detection and identification of 14 respiratory viral nucleic acids. Results. RVIs were reported in every month in all four years. The peak months were January and February, driven by the peak activity of Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Rhinovirus was isolated the most frequently. The least isolated was Adenovirus. A seasonality was observed with Influenza, RSV, human parainfluenza and human metapneumovirus; however, infections with each virus occurred outside of peak months including an outbreak of Influenza in July and August 2013. The total number of viral infections varied each year as did the total number for each virus. The year 2015 had the lowest number of RVIs reported at 427, followed by the year 2016 with the most RVIs reported at 515. However, 2016 was not the peak incidence for each virus; it was the peak incidence for RSV and Rhinovirus. In fact, Influenza had its lowest number of cases in 2016. Conclusion. At our institution, we have shown that RVIs are more common than previously described in MM patients. RVIs occur in every month throughout the year. Although a seasonality is seen with these viral infections, infections do occur outside of the months considered to be peak months for each virus. Infection control policies, therefore, must be enforced year round. More studies, however, are needed to assess the proportion of community vs. healthcare acquired.

39075,Vous avez dit retraite…?,2020-09-12,"This paper aims at understanding the social behavior of people with dementia through the use of technology, specifically by analyzing localization data of patients of an Alzheimer’s assisted care home in Italy. The analysis will allow to promote social relations by enhancing the facility’s spaces and activities, with the ultimate objective of improving residents’ quality of life. To assess social wellness and evaluate the effectiveness of the village areas and activities, this work introduces measures of sociability for both residents and places. Our data analysis is based on classical statistical methods and innovative machine learning techniques. First, we analyze the correlation between relational indicators and factors such as the outdoor temperature and the patients’ movements inside the facility. Then, we use statistical and accessibility analyses to determine the spaces residents appreciate the most and those in need of enhancements. We observe that patients’ sociability is strongly related to the considered factors. From our analysis, outdoor areas result less frequented and need spatial redesign to promote accessibility and attendance among patients. The data awareness obtained from our analysis will also be of great help to caregivers, doctors, and psychologists to enhance assisted care home social activities, adjust patient-specific treatments, and deepen the comprehension of the disease.","Bellini, Gloria; Cipriano, Marco; De Angeli, Nicola; Gargano, Jacopo Pio; Gianella, Matteo; Goi, Gianluca; Rossi, Gabriele; Masciadri, Andrea; Comai, Sara",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7479800/,539

52008,Les plans européens de pharmacovigilance renforcée : sécurité ou frein ?()(),2021-04-18,"BACKGROUND: Mucosal leishmaniasis (ML), the most inflammatory form of tegumentary leishmaniasis, is predominantly caused by Leishmania braziliensis. The disease is characterized by the development of lesions, mainly in the nasal mucosa. An exacerbated inflammatory response has been associated with the presence of destructive and disfiguring lesions, with stages of severity ranging from small nodulations to the complete destruction of the nasal pyramid architecture. As Leishmania is an intracellular parasite, most immunological studies have emphasized the cell-mediated immune response, while relatively few studies aimed to investigate the role antibodies in protection against, or the pathology of ML. METHODS: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ML were classified according to clinical staging criteria. Serum levels of Leishmania-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies were determined by ELISA before and after treatment with antimony or antimony plus pentoxifylline. RESULTS: Patients in stages IV and V produced higher concentrations of IgG and IgG1 antibodies when compared to those in stage I and II. Significant reductions were seen in the concentrations of IgG and IgG2 antibodies in most patients who responded well to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate an association between IgG antibody titers and the severity of mucosal disease. The observed reduction in antibody production after successful treatment in most patients preliminarily indicates that these tests can be used to aid in the assessment of therapeutic response.","de Lima, Clara Mônica F.; Magalhães, Andrea S.; Costa, Rúbia; Barreto, Carolina C.; Machado, Paulo R.

185928,"Revised U.S. surveillance case definition for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and update on SARS cases--United States and worldwide, December 2003.",2003,"Methods for detecting and dissecting the interactions of virally encoded proteins are essential for probing basic viral biology and providing a foundation for therapeutic advances. The dearth of targeted therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19, an ongoing global health crisis, underscores the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of the interactions of SARS-CoV-2-encoded proteins. Here we describe the use of a convenient bacteria-based two-hybrid (B2H) system to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We identify sixteen distinct intraviral protein-protein interactions (PPIs), involving sixteen proteins. We find that many of the identified proteins interact with more than one partner. We further show how our system facilitates the genetic dissection of these interactions, enabling the identification of selectively disruptive mutations. We also describe a modified B2H system that permits the detection of disulfide bond-dependent PPIs in the normally reducing Escherichia coli cytoplasm and we use this system to detect the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) with its cognate cell surface receptor ACE2. We then examine how the RBD-ACE2 interaction is perturbed by several RBD amino acid substitutions found in currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our findings illustrate the utility of a genetically tractable bacterial system for probing the interactions of viral proteins and investigating the effects of emerging mutations. In principle, the system could also facilitate the identification of potential therapeutics that disrupt specific interactions of virally encoded proteins. More generally, our findings establish the feasibility of using a B2H system to detect and dissect disulfide bond-dependent interactions of eukaryotic proteins. Importance Understanding how virally encoded proteins interact with one another is essential in elucidating basic viral biology, providing a foundation for therapeutic discovery. Here we describe the use of a versatile bacteria-based system to investigate the interactions of the protein set encoded by SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current pandemic. We identify sixteen distinct intraviral protein-protein interactions, involving sixteen proteins, many of which interact with more than one partner. Our system facilitates the genetic dissection of these interactions, enabling the identification of selectively disruptive mutations. We also describe a modified version of our bacteria-based system that permits detection of the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (specifically its receptor binding domain) and its cognate human cell surface receptor ACE2 and we investigate the effects of spike mutations found in currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our findings illustrate the general utility of our system for probing the interactions of virally encoded proteins.","Springstein, Benjamin L.; Deighan, Padraig; Grabe, Grzegorz; Hochschild, Ann",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.07.463611,539

197316,"Nosocomial transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis found through screening for severe acute respiratory syndrome--Taipei, Taiwan, 2003.",2004,"During the 2003 outbreak, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread to more than 30 countries. Not only did it cause severe health problems but it also imposed a great psychological impact on the public. SARS emerged in Taiwan during April 2003. This study investigates the psychosocial impact and the associated factors of depression of the SARS epidemic in Taiwan when the epidemic had just been controlled. A total of 1552 respondents were recruited in the study by random selection from the telephone book. Demographic data, SARS experience, self-perceived health state, neighborhood relationships, and depression were surveyed by telephone interviewing. Respondents were grouped as 'impacted group' and 'non-impacted group' according to whether they or their friends and family had been quarantined, or suspected of being infected. The psychosocial impact and associated factors were compared between the two groups. The 'impacted group' had higher depressive levels, poorer neighborhood relationships, poorer self-perceived health, and a higher economic impact than the 'non-impacted group'. The poorer self-perceived health and economic impact factors were associated with depression. The neighborhood relationship factor was negatively associated with depression for the 'impacted group', but not for the 'non-impacted group'. The 'impacted group' had experienced greater psychosocial impact possibly due to the SARS impact, the economic downturn, poor self-perceived health conditions, and decreased social support systems. An appropriate mental health intervention to improve the self-perceived health condition, to provide instrumental and psychological support for the 'impacted group', and to decrease the stigmatization and discrimination from the public could have buffered the psychological impact from this epidemic disaster.","Ko, Chih-Hung; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Yen, Ju-Yu; Yang, Ming-Jen",Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16884438/,539
198197,"Update: Outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome--worldwide, 2003.",2003,"We have analyzed the intracellular transport of the spike (S) protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus. Surface expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy, by surface biotinylation, and by syncytium formation by S-expressing cells. By applying these methods, the S protein was found to be retained intracellularly. Tyr1143 in the cytoplasmic tail was shown to be a crucial component of the retention signal. Deletion of a dilysine motif that has previously been suggested to function as a retrieval signal did not abolish intracellular retention. Treatment of the S proteins with endoglycosidases did not reveal any differences between the parental and the mutant proteins. Furthermore, all S proteins analyzed were posttranslationally cleaved into the subunits S1 and S2. In coexpression experiments, the S protein was found to colocalize with a Golgi marker. Taken together, these results indicate that the S protein of IBV is retained at a late Golgi compartment. Therefore, this viral surface protein differs from the S proteins of transmissible gastroenteritis virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which are retained at a pre-Golgi compartment or transported to the cell surface, respectively. The implications of these differences are discussed.","Winter, Christine; Schwegmann-Wessels, Christel; Neumann, Ulrich; Herrler, Georg",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18094153/,539

246099,Surveiller les variants du SARS-CoV-2 : comment et pourquoi ?,2021,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put a strain on health systems globally. Although Africa is the least affected region to date, it has the weakest health systems and an exponential rise in cases as has been observed in other regions, is bound to overwhelm its health systems. Early detection and isolation of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases are pivotal to the prevention and control of the pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all laboratory-confirmed cases should be isolated and treated in a health care facility; however, where this is not possible due to the health system capacity, patients can be isolated in re-purposed facilities or at home. An already very apparent future challenge for Africa is facility-based isolation of COVID-19 cases, given the already limited health infrastructure and health workforce, and the risk of nosocomial transmission. Use of repurposed facilities requires additional resources, including health workers. Home isolation, on the other hand, would be a challenge given the poor housing, overcrowding, inadequate access to water and sanitation, and stigma related to infectious disease that is prevalent in many African societies. Conflict settings on the continent pose an additional challenge to the prevention and control of COVID-19 with the resultant population displacements in overcrowded camps where access to social services is limited. These unique cultural, social, economic and developmental differences on the continent, call for a tailored approach to COVID-19 case management strategies. This article proposes three broad case management strategies based on the transmission scenarios defined by WHO, and the criteria and package of care for each option, for consideration by policy makers and governments in African countries. Moving forward, African countries should generate local evidence to guide the development of realistic home-grown strategies, protocol and equipment for the management of COVID-19 cases on the continent .","Waya, Joy Luba Lomole; Ameh, David; Mogga, Joseph Lou K; Wamala, Joseph F; Olu, Olushayo Oluseun",Infect Dis Poverty,,539

AIMS: We aimed to characterize the adverse skin reactions occurring after hand hygiene and glove use in HCWs in a tertiary university hospital to determine the possible causative factors and whether the use of these measures is affected. METHODS: Between April 15 and May 1, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted, using online questionnaire, answered by HCWs in a tertiary university hospital. RESULTS: The increase in general hand-skin problems during the pandemic period was statistically significant (P = .004). The most common symptom was dryness. During the pandemic period, 67 (24.3%) HCWs thought that the conditions were caused by glove use, and 197 (71.4%) thought that they were due to alcohol-based hand antiseptics. The incidence of other hand-skin conditions except for vesicles was statistically higher in women than in men (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased number of hand-skin conditions during the pandemic should not be ignored, since hand hygiene and glove use are expected to increase.","Altunisik Toplu, Sibel; Altunisik, Nihal; Turkmen, Dursun; Ersoy, Yasemin",,,539

вирус SARS-CoV-2 использует летучих мышей в качестве промежуточных хозяев Попадая в организм человека, так же как и SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 начинает взаимодействовать с ангиотензин-превращающим ферментом 2 (ACE2), рецептором на поверхности клетки В результате такого взаимодействия вирус проникает в клетки и запускает инфекционный процесс в организме человека, а заболевание получило название COVID-19 В ответ на вирусную инфекцию активируется система врожденного иммунитета, что приводит к усилению производства и высвобождению провоспалительных цитокинов, таких как IL-6, IL-1SS, IL-8, TNF-a, а также хемокинов, таких как G-CSF, IP10, MCP1, и развитию воспалительной реакции COVID-19 сопровождается чрезмерным воспалением и повышенным содержанием провоспалительных цитокинов и хемокинов в сыворотке крови, что свидетельствует о развитии синдрома высвобождения цитокинов, или «цитокинового шторма» В ходе развивающегося синдрома высвобождения цитокинов происходят нарушения коагуляции, чрезмерный оксидативный стресс, повреждение жизненно важных органов и нарушение функций иммунной системы Эти проявления прогрессируют и в конце концов приводят к развитию синдрома диссеминированного внутрисосудистого свертывания и полиорганной недостаточности Чрезмерные воспалительные реакции и прогрессирующий оксидативный стресс вызывают дисфункцию и повреждение митохондрий В результате в зоне воспаления накапливаются фрагменты разрушенных клеток и остатки разрушенных митохондрий, содержащие митохондриальную ДНК Эти продукты разрушения клеток, в свою очередь, действуя как молекулярные паттерны, связанные с повреждением, пролонгируют острое воспаление до развития хронического чрезмерного воспаления Таким образом, вирус, первоначально попадая в легкие, инициирует острый респираторный дистресс-синдром с последующим развитием синдрома диссеминированного внутрисосудистого свертывания Этот синдром сопровождается повреждением эндотелиальных клеток сосудов и нарушением системы свертывания крови Прогрессирование этих нарушений приводит к расстройствам центральной нервной системы, почечной и печеночной недостаточности и, наконец, к полиорганной недостаточности Лечение пациентов с COVID-19 должно быть основано на подавлении чрезмерного воспалительного ответа и «цитокинового шторма» Для этого есть несколько возможностей Целесообразно рассмотреть, во-первых, назначение фавипиравира для снижения активности SARS-CoV-2 и нафамостата для подавления функции ACE2, а во-вторых, назначение противоревматических препаратов (таких как моноклональные антитела, которые нейтрализуют или цитокины IL-1SS и IL-6, или рецепторы этих цитокинов, например тоцилизумаб) Наконец, для улучшения нарушенных функции митохондрий при синдроме высвобождения цитокинов/«цитокиновом шторме» может оказаться эффективным мелатонин В обзоре все эти вопросы рассмотрены в основном на материалах отчетов из Китая и стран Европы","Yokota, Shumpei Kuroiwa Yoshiyuki Nishioka Nishioka","Infectious Diseases: News, Views, Education",,539

This novel viral infection demonstrated unique features that include prothrombotic clinical presentations. However, one year after the first occurrence, there remain many unanswered questions. We tried to address some of the important queries in this review. AREAS COVERED: We raised the following critical questions. 'Why is COVID-19 so hypercoagulable?', 'Why are most coagulation test results relatively normal?', 'Why is COVID-19-associated coagulopathy more thrombotic than most other infectious diseases?', 'Why is arterial thrombus formed frequently?', 'Is anticoagulant therapy for COVID-19 effective?', and 'Are there racial disparities in thrombosis in COVID-19?' EXPERT OPINION: There are commonalities and differences in the pathogeneses and clinical features between COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Correct understanding will help discussing appropriate anticoagulation prophylaxis or treatment for thromboembolism.","Iba, Toshiaki; Levy, Jerrold H; Connors, Jean Marie; Warkentin, Theodore E; Thachil, Jecko; Levi, Marcel",Expert Rev Respir Med,,539

The CPPain survey is a comprehensive cross-sectional study. Researchers plan to recruit approximately 1400 children with CP (primary participants) across several countries over 6-12 months using multimodal recruitment strategies. Data will be collected from parents or guardians of children with CP (0-17 years) and from children with CP (8-17 years) who are able to self-report. Siblings (12-17 years) will be invited to participate as controls. The CPPain survey consists of previously validated and study-specific questionnaires addressing demographic and diagnostic information, pain experience, pain management, pain interference, pain coping, activity and participation in everyday life, nutritional status, mental health, health-related quality of life, and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on pain and access to pain care. The survey will be distributed primarily online. Data will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods for comparing groups. Stratification will be used to investigate subgroups, and analyses will be adjusted for appropriate sociodemographic variables.

The model quantifies the potential impact of physical/social distancing and population density on the disease burden. Results reveal that with no fatalities and no infected entrants, the reproduction numbers associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic cases are inversely proportional to; the habitat area size, and the efforts employed in tracing and hospitalising these cases. The critical habitat area below which the disease dies out is directly proportion to the time taken to identify and hospitalise infected individuals. Results also show that disease persistence in the community is guaranteed even with minimal admission of infected individuals. Our results further show that as the level of compliance to standard operating procedures (SOPs) increases, then the disease prevalence peaks are greatly reduced and delayed. Therefore, proper adherence to SOPs such as use of masks, physical distancing measures and effective contact tracing should be highly enforced in crowded settings if COVID-19 is to be mitigated.","Ssematimba, A; Nakakawa, J N; Ssebuliba, J; Mugisha, J Y T",Int J Dyn Control,,539

Recently FDA and CDC warnings of fatal cardiac toxicity from Torsade de Pointes (TDP) arrhythmia from HCQ use have been made, notwithstanding the long safe HCQ use for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. This has resulted in restricted access of HCQ for COVID 19 treatment. We hypothesized that HCQ and azithromycin have not been reported to cause significant acute cardiac arrhythmic mortality. Methods: We performed a literature search for the effects of HCQ and azithromycin on the heart. Results: No Torsade de Pointes or related deaths were found to have been reported as a result of HCQ and azithromycin use in the peer reviewed literature. To the contrary HCQ/azithromycin were uniformly found to substantially reduce cardiac mortality and also to decrease thrombosis, arrhythmia and cholesterol in treated patients in recent peer reviewed studies and meeting presentations. Conclusions: HCQ and azithromycin do not cause TDP cardiac mortality. HCQ decreases cardiac events. HCQ should not be restricted in use for COVID 19 patients because of fear of cardiac mortality.","Prodromos, Chadwick C",New Microbes New Infect,,539

Despite the race for effective vaccine and drug against further expansion and fatality rate of this novel coronavirus, there is still lack of effective antiviral therapy. To this effect, we deemed it necessary to identify potential B and T cell epitopes from the envelope S protein. This can be used as potential targets to develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine preparations. In this study, we used immunoinformatics to identify conservative B and T cell epitopes for S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which might play roles in the initiation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified the B cell and T cell peptide epitopes of S protein and their antigenicity, as well as the interaction between the peptide epitopes and human leucocyte antigen (HLA). Among the B cell epitopes, 'EILDITPCSFGGVS' has the highest score of antigenicity and great immunogenicity. In T cell epitopes, MHC-I peptide 'KIADYNYKL' and MHC-II peptide 'LEILDITPC' were identified as high antigens. Besides, docking analysis showed that the predicted peptide 'KIADYNYKL' was closely bound to the HLA-A*0201. The results of molecular dynamics simulation through GROMACS software showed that 'HLA-A*0201~peptide' complex was very stable. And the peptide we selected could induce the T cell response similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the predicted peptides were highly conserved in different isolates from different countries.

We aimed to quantify the associations between socio-economic status and COVID-19-related cases and mortality in the U.S. STUDY DESIGN: The study design includes nationwide COVID-19 data at the county level that were paired with the Distressed Communities Index (DCI) and its component metrics of socio-economic status. METHODS: Severely distressed communities were classified by DCI>75 for univariate analyses. Adjusted rate ratios were calculated for cases and fatalities per 100,000 persons using hierarchical linear mixed models. RESULTS: This cohort included 1,089,999 cases and 62,298 deaths in 3127 counties for a case fatality rate of 5.7%. Severely distressed counties had significantly fewer deaths from COVID-19 but higher number of deaths per 100,000 persons. In risk-adjusted analysis, the two socio-economic determinants of health with the strongest association with both higher cases per 100,000 persons and higher fatalities per 100,000 persons were the percentage of adults without a high school degree (cases: RR 1.10; fatalities: RR 1.08) and proportion of black residents (cases and fatalities: Relative risk(RR) 1.03). The percentage of the population aged older than 65 years was also highly predictive for fatalities per 100,000 persons (RR 1.07). CONCLUSION: Lower education levels and greater percentages of black residents are strongly associated with higher rates of both COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Socio-economic factors should be considered when implementing public health interventions to ameliorate the disparities in the impact of COVID-19 on distressed communities.","Hawkins, R B; Charles, E J; Mehaffey, J H",Public Health,,539

593557,"De nouvelles habitudes alimentaires, de nouveaux risques parasitaires : l’exemple du poisson()",2020-10-13,"BACKGROUND: Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic, resulting in the need for rapid assays to allow diagnosis and prevention of transmission. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provides a gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but instrument costs are high and supply chains are potentially fragile, motivating interest in additional assay methods. Reverse transcription and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) provides an alternative that uses orthogonal and often less expensive reagents without the need for thermocyclers. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is typically detected using dyes to report bulk amplification of DNA; however, a common artifact is nonspecific DNA amplification, which complicates detection. RESULTS: Here we describe the design and testing of molecular beacons, which allow sequence-specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes with improved discrimination in simple reaction mixtures. To optimize beacons for RT-LAMP, multiple locked nucleic acid monomers were incorporated to elevate melting temperatures. We also show how beacons with different fluorescent labels can allow convenient multiplex detection of several amplicons in “single pot” reactions, including incorporation of a human RNA LAMP-BEAC assay to confirm sample integrity. Comparison of LAMP-BEAC and RT-qPCR on clinical saliva samples showed good concordance between assays. To facilitate implementation, we developed custom polymerases for LAMP-BEAC and inexpensive purification procedures, which also facilitates increasing sensitivity by increasing reaction volumes. CONCLUSIONS: LAMP-BEAC thus provides an affordable and simple SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay suitable for population screening; implementation of the assay has allowed robust screening of thousands of saliva samples per week.

The growing demand for commercial kits used for automated extraction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, a key step before rRT-PCR diagnosis, could cause a shortage of stocks that hinders the rapid processing of samples. Although the recommendation is to use automated methods for nucleic acid extraction, alternatives are necessary to replace commercial kits. However, these alternatives should be as reliable as automated methods. This work describes a simple method to detect SARS-CoV-2 from specimens collected in different preservation media. Samples were previously inactivated by heating and precipitating with a PEG/NaCl solution before rRT-PCR assays for Orf1ab, N and S genes. The new method was compared with an automated protocol of nucleic acid extraction. Both procedures showed similar analytical results. Consequently, this simple and inexpensive method is a suitable procedure for laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ulloa, S.; Bravo, C.; Parra, B.; Ramirez, E.; Acevedo, A.; Fasce, R.; Fernandez, J.",J Virol Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2020.113960; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093420302123; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093420302123?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835738/,539

With the help of thousands of viral genome sequences that have been accumulating, it has become possible to track the evolution of the viral genome over time as it spread across the world. An important question that still needs to be answered is whether any of the common mutations affect the viral properties, and therefore the disease characteristics. Therefore, we sought to understand the effects of mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), particularly the common 14408C>T mutation, on mutation rate and viral spread. By focusing on mutations in the slowly evolving M or E genes, we aimed to minimize the effects of selective pressure. Our results indicate that 14408C>T mutation increases the mutation rate, while the third-most common RdRp mutation, 15324C>T, has the opposite effect. It is possible that 14408C>T mutation may have contributed to the dominance of its co-mutations in Europe and elsewhere.","Eskier, Doğa; Karakülah, Gökhan; Suner, Aslı; Oktay, Yavuz",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32742818/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9587,539

HDU care included awake proning by respiratory physiotherapists.

Patients managed with CPAP alone 22/48 (45.8%) were significantly less likely to die than patients who required transfer onto HFNO 26/48 (54.2%): CPAP mortality 36.4%; HFNO mortality 69.2%, (p=0.023); however, multivariate analysis demonstrated that increasing age and the inability to awake prone were the only independent predictors of COVID-19 mortality. The mortality of patients with COVID-19 requiring respiratory support is considerable.

654471,Pandémies: les leçons du passé,2020-06-04,"BACKGROUND: For most parents, getting pregnant means having a child. Generally, the couple outlines plans and has expectations regarding the baby. When these plans are interrupted because of a perinatal loss, it turns out to be a traumatic experience for the family. Validating the grief of these losses has been a challenge to Brazilian society, which is evident considering the childbirth care offered to bereaved families in maternity wards. Positively assessed care that brings physical and emotional memories about the baby has a positive impact on the bereavement process that family undergoes. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effects supportive guidelines have on mental health. They were designed to assist grieving parents and their families while undergoing perinatal loss in public maternities in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo state, Brazil. METHOD: A mixed-methods (qualitative/quantitative), quasi-experimental (before/after) study. The intervention is the implementation of bereavement supportive guidelines for women who experienced a stillbirth or a neonatal death. A total of forty women will be included. Twenty participants will be assessed before and twenty will be assessed after the implementation of the guidelines. A semi-structured questionnaire and three scales will be used to assess the effects of the guidelines. Health care professionals and managers of all childbirth facilities will be invited to participate in focus group. Data will be analyzed using statistical tests, as well as thematic analysis approach. DISCUSSION: The Perinatal Bereavement guidelines are a local adaptation of the Canadian and British corresponding guidelines. These guidelines have been developed based on the families’ needs of baby memories during the bereavement process and include the following aspects: (1) Organization of care into periods, considering their respective needs along the process; (2) Creation of the Bereavement Professional figure in maternity wards; (3) Adequacy of the institutional environment; (4) Communication of the guidance; (5) Creation of baby memories. We expect that the current project generates additional evidence for improving the mental health of women and families that experience a perinatal loss. Trial registration RBR-3cpthr PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: For many couples, getting pregnant does not only mean carrying a baby, but also having a child. Most of the time, the couple has already made many plans and has expectations towards the child. When these plans are interrupted because of a perinatal loss, it turns out to be a traumatic experience for the family. In Brazilian culture, validating this traumatic grief is very difficult, especially when it happens too soon. The barriers can be noticed not only by the way society deals with the parents’ grief, but also when we see the care the grieving families receive from the health care establishment. Creating physical and emotional memories might bring the parents satisfaction regarding the care they receive when a baby dies. These memories can be built when there is good communication throughout the care received; shared decisions; the chance to see and hold the baby, as well as collect memories; privacy and continuous care during the whole process, including when there is a new pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal period. With this in mind, among the most important factors are the training of health staff and other professionals, the preparation of the maternity ward to support bereaved families and the continuous support to the professionals involved in the bereavement. This article proposes guidelines to support the families who are experiencing stillbirth and neonatal death. It may be followed by childbirth professionals (nurses, midwives, obstetricians and employees of a maternity ward), managers, researchers, policymakers or those interested in developing specific protocols for their maternity wards.","Salgado, Heloisa de Oliveira; Andreucci, Carla Betina; Gomes, Ana Clara Rezende; Souza, João Paulo",Reprod Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33407643/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-020-01040-4,539

However thorough interrogation of the interplay between infected cells and the immune system at sites of infection is lacking. We use high parameter imaging mass cytometry(9) targeting the expression of 36 proteins, to investigate at single cell resolution, the cellular composition and spatial architecture of human acute lung injury including SARS-CoV-2. This spatially resolved, single-cell data unravels the disordered structure of the infected and injured lung alongside the distribution of extensive immune infiltration. Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration are hallmarks of bacterial pneumonia and COVID-19, respectively. We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects predominantly alveolar epithelial cells and induces a localized hyper-inflammatory cell state associated with lung damage. By leveraging the temporal range of COVID-19 severe fatal disease in relation to the time of symptom onset, we observe increased macrophage extravasation, mesenchymal cells, and fibroblasts abundance concomitant with increased proximity between these cell types as the disease progresses, possibly as an attempt to repair the damaged lung tissue. This spatially resolved single-cell data allowed us to develop a biologically interpretable landscape of lung pathology from a structural, immunological and clinical standpoint. This spatial single-cell landscape enabled the pathophysiological characterization of the human lung from its macroscopic presentation to the single-cell, providing an important basis for the understanding of COVID-19, and lung pathology in general.","Rendeiro, André Figueiredo; Ravichandran, Hiranmayi; Bram, Yaron; Salvatore, Steven; Borczuk, Alain; Elemento, Olivier; Schwartz, Robert Edward",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.26.20219584; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20219584v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140072/,539

With higher burden of malaria in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries coupled with fragile healthcare system and delivery, these may pose a threat in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients co-infected with malaria. Free radicals have been implicated in the progression and pathogenesis of malaria and COVID-19 through Fenton’s reaction and cytokine storm respectively. METHODS: the current research comprises of seventy-four (74) participants; 20 apparently healthy controls and 54 COVID-19 patients (34 among which were co-infected with malaria). Serum levels of 8-iso PGF2α and Alphatocopherol were determined among the study participants using ELISA technique and colorimetric assay, respectively. RESULTS: results revealed statistically significant elevation of 8-iso PGF2α in COVID-19 patients co-infected with malaria compared to COVID-19 patients only, and this may be due to increase production of free radicals. Furthermore, a significant decrease of Alphatocopherol was observed in COVID-19 co-infected with malaria compared to COVID-19 patients due to increase utilization of antioxidants in counterbalancing the negative effect of free radicals generated. CONCLUSION: conclusively, SARS-COV-2 patients co-infected with malaria might be predisposed to oxidative stress and low Alphatocopherol. The increase in oxidative stress is proportional to malaria parasite density and inversely related to Alphatocopherol levels. This implies that oxidative stress is notably higher and such patients may have a severer form of the COVID-19. Increased 8-iso-PGF2α in co-infection and decreased alphatocopherol levels can reflect the severity and adverse outcomes compared to COVID-19 naïve because of their tremendous involvement in the pathogenesis and progression of diseases.","Muhammad, Yahaya; Aminu, Yamuna Kani; Ahmad, Abdurrahman Elfulaty; Iliya, Sani; Muhd, Nuruddeen; Yahaya, Mohammed; Mustapha, Aminu Sale; Tahiru, Abdulkhabir; Abdulkadir, Sulaiman Saeed; Ibrahim, Jamila Suleiman; Ahmad, Abdulmalik Binji; Muhammad, Idris Yahaya; Shehu, Zaharaddeen; Yakubu, Abdulrahman; Muhd, Bashir Kabir; Ahmed, Armaya’u; Faruk, Umar Abubakar",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2020.37.78.25100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244341/,539

In this study, we evaluated the influence of information (formal and informal) sources on situational awareness of the public for adopting health‐protective behaviors such as social distancing. For this purpose, a questionnaire‐based survey was conducted. The hypothesis proposed suggests that adoption of social distancing practices is an outcome of situational awareness which is achieved by the information sources. Results suggest that information sources, formal (P = .001) and informal (P = 0.007) were found to be significantly related to perceived understanding. Findings also indicate that social distancing is significantly influenced by situational awareness, P = .000.

METHODS: In our quest for finding potential drug against this virus, 15 anti-malarial drugs including chloroquine, and 2413 FDA approved drugs were investigated against both protease and spike proteins of COVID-19 usingin-silico approach. Molecular docking analysis followed by MD simulation was carried out to estimate the binding and stability of the complexes. RESULTS: In this study, we found a single drug Paromomycin against two targets of COVID-19 i.e. Spike protein (S1) and protease domain. Paromomycin was found to have strong binding affinity against both the targets of coronavirus. The results also showed that no anti-malarial drug exhibited effective binding against either S1 or protease. CONCLUSIONS: Current study concluded that Paromomycin is an effective dual targeting drug against coronavirus, as it binds not only to the protease domain of the virion but also with the spike domain with high stability. Furthermore, none of the anti-malarial drugs showed strong binding affinity for either protease or receptor binding domain (RBD).","Tariq, Asma; Mateen, Rana Muhammad; Afzal, Muhammad Sohail; Saleem, Mahjabeen",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220304987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32579907/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220304987?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.063,539
