21,Protein secretion in Lactococcus lactis : an efficient way to increase the overall heterologous protein production,2005-01-04,"Lactococcus lactis, the model lactic acid bacterium (LAB), is a food grade and well-characterized Gram positive bacterium. It is a good candidate for heterologous protein delivery in foodstuff or in the digestive tract. L. lactis can also be used as a protein producer in fermentor. Many heterologous proteins have already been produced in L. lactis but only few reports allow comparing production yields for a given protein either produced intracellularly or secreted in the medium. Here, we review several works evaluating the influence of the localization on the production yields of several heterologous proteins produced in L. lactis. The questions of size limits, conformation, and proteolysis are addressed and discussed with regard to protein yields. These data show that i) secretion is preferable to cytoplasmic production; ii) secretion enhancement (by signal peptide and propeptide optimization) results in increased production yield; iii) protein conformation rather than protein size can impair secretion and thus alter production yields; and iv) fusion of a stable protein can stabilize labile proteins. The role of intracellular proteolysis on heterologous cytoplasmic proteins and precursors is discussed. The new challenges now are the development of food grade systems and the identification and optimization of host factors affecting heterologous protein production not only in L. lactis, but also in other LAB species.","Le Loir, Yves; Azevedo, Vasco; Oliveira, Sergio C; Freitas, Daniela A; Miyoshi, Anderson; Bermúdez-Humarán, Luis G; Nouaille, Sébastien; Ribeiro, Luciana A; Leclercq, Sophie; Gabriel, Jane E; Guimaraes, Valeria D; Oliveira, Maricê N; Charlier, Cathy; Gautier, Michel; Langella, Philippe",Microb Cell Fact,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC545053/,21
24,A Gene Encoding Sialic-Acid-Specific 9-O-Acetylesterase Found in Human Adult Testis,2004-07-29,"Using differential display RT-PCR, we identified a gene of 2750 bp from human adult testis, named H-Lse, which encoded a putative protein of 523 amino acids and molecular weight of 58 kd with structural characteristics similar to that of mouse lysosome sialic-acid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase. Northern blot analysis showed a widespread distribution of H-Lse in various human tissues with high expression in the testis, prostate, and colon. In situ hybridization results showed that while H-Lse was not detected in embryonic testis, positive signals were found in spermatocytes but not spermatogonia in adult testis of human. The subcellular localization of H-Lse was visualized by green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the amino terminus of H-Lse, showing compartmentalization of H-Lse in large dense-core vesicles, presumably lysosomes, in the cytoplasm. The developmentally regulated and spermatogenic stage-specific expression of H-Lse suggests its possible involvement in the development of the testis and/or differentiation of germ cells.","Zhu, Hu; Chang Chan, Hsiao; Zhou, Zuoming; Li, Jianming; Zhu, Hui; Yin, Lanlan; Xu, Ming; Cheng, Lijun; Sha, Jiahao",J Biomed Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC551583/,21
123,Nucleolus: the fascinating nuclear body,2007-11-29,"Nucleoli are the prominent contrasted structures of the cell nucleus. In the nucleolus, ribosomal RNAs are synthesized, processed and assembled with ribosomal proteins. RNA polymerase I synthesizes the ribosomal RNAs and this activity is cell cycle regulated. The nucleolus reveals the functional organization of the nucleus in which the compartmentation of the different steps of ribosome biogenesis is observed whereas the nucleolar machineries are in permanent exchange with the nucleoplasm and other nuclear bodies. After mitosis, nucleolar assembly is a time and space regulated process controlled by the cell cycle. In addition, by generating a large volume in the nucleus with apparently no RNA polymerase II activity, the nucleolus creates a domain of retention/sequestration of molecules normally active outside the nucleolus. Viruses interact with the nucleolus and recruit nucleolar proteins to facilitate virus replication. The nucleolus is also a sensor of stress due to the redistribution of the ribosomal proteins in the nucleoplasm by nucleolus disruption. The nucleolus plays several crucial functions in the nucleus: in addition to its function as ribosome factory of the cells it is a multifunctional nuclear domain, and nucleolar activity is linked with several pathologies. Perspectives on the evolution of this research area are proposed.","Sirri, Valentina; Urcuqui-Inchima, Silvio; Roussel, Pascal; Hernandez-Verdun, Danièle",Histochem Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2137947/,21
166,Dating the time of viral subtype divergence,2008-06-09,"Precise dating of viral subtype divergence enables researchers to correlate divergence with geographic and demographic occurrences. When historical data are absent (that is, the overwhelming majority), viral sequence sampling on a time scale commensurate with the rate of substitution permits the inference of the times of subtype divergence. Currently, researchers use two strategies to approach this task, both requiring strong conditions on the molecular clock assumption of substitution rate. As the underlying structure of the substitution rate process at the time of subtype divergence is not understood and likely highly variable, we present a simple method that estimates rates of substitution, and from there, times of divergence, without use of an assumed molecular clock. We accomplish this by blending estimates of the substitution rate for triplets of dated sequences where each sequence draws from a distinct viral subtype, providing a zeroth-order approximation for the rate between subtypes. As an example, we calculate the time of divergence for three genes among influenza subtypes A-H3N2 and B using subtype C as an outgroup. We show a time of divergence approximately 100 years ago, substantially more recent than previous estimates which range from 250 to 3800 years ago.","O'Brien, John D; She, Zhen-Su; Suchard, Marc A",BMC Evol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2443812/,21
189,Molecular evidence for the evolution of ichnoviruses from ascoviruses by symbiogenesis,2008-09-18,"BACKGROUND: Female endoparasitic ichneumonid wasps inject virus-like particles into their caterpillar hosts to suppress immunity. These particles are classified as ichnovirus virions and resemble ascovirus virions, which are also transmitted by parasitic wasps and attack caterpillars. Ascoviruses replicate DNA and produce virions. Polydnavirus DNA consists of wasp DNA replicated by the wasp from its genome, which also directs particle synthesis. Structural similarities between ascovirus and ichnovirus particles and the biology of their transmission suggest that ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses, although molecular evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. RESULTS: Here we show that a family of unique pox-D5 NTPase proteins in the Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus are related to three Diadromus pulchellus ascovirus proteins encoded by ORFs 90, 91 and 93. A new alignment technique also shows that two proteins from a related ichnovirus are orthologs of other ascovirus virion proteins. CONCLUSION: Our results provide molecular evidence supporting the origin of ichnoviruses from ascoviruses by lateral transfer of ascoviral genes into ichneumonid wasp genomes, perhaps the first example of symbiogenesis between large DNA viruses and eukaryotic organisms. We also discuss the limits of this evidence through complementary studies, which revealed that passive lateral transfer of viral genes among polydnaviral, bacterial, and wasp genomes may have occurred repeatedly through an intimate coupling of both recombination and replication of viral genomes during evolution. The impact of passive lateral transfers on evolutionary relationships between polydnaviruses and viruses with large double-stranded genomes is considered in the context of the theory of symbiogenesis.","Bigot, Yves; Samain, Sylvie; Augé-Gouillou, Corinne; Federici, Brian A",BMC Evol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2567993/,21
265,Rooting human parechovirus evolution in time,2009-07-15,"BACKGROUND: The Picornaviridae family contains a number of important pathogenic viruses, among which the recently reclassified human parechoviruses (HPeVs). These viruses are widespread and can be grouped in several types. Understanding the evolutionary history of HPeV could answer questions such as how long the circulating lineages last shared a common ancestor and how the evolution of this viral species is shaped by its population dynamics. Using both strict and relaxed clock Bayesian phylogenetics we investigated 1) the substitutions rates of the structural P1 and capsid VP1 regions and 2) evolutionary timescale of currently circulating HPeV lineages. RESULTS: Our estimates reveal that human parechoviruses exhibit high substitution rates for both structural P1 and capsid VP1 regions, respectively 2.21 × 10(-3 )(0.48 – 4.21 × 10(-3)) and 2.79 × 10(-3 )(2.05 – 3.66 × 10(-3)) substitutions per site per year. These are within the range estimated for other picornaviruses. By employing a constant population size coalescent prior, the date of the most recent common ancestor was estimated to be at around 1600 (1427–1733). In addition, by looking at the frequency of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions within the VP1 gene we show that purifying selection constitutes the dominating evolutionary force leading to strong amino acid conservation. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our estimates provide a timescale for the evolution of HPeVs and suggest that genetic diversity of current circulating HPeV types has arisen about 400 years ago.","Faria, Nuno R; de Vries, Michel; van Hemert, Formijn J; Benschop, Kimberley; van der Hoek, Lia",BMC Evol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723090/,21
276,Empirical Relationship between Intra-Purine and Intra-Pyrimidine Differences in Conserved Gene Sequences,2009-08-28,"DNA sequences seen in the normal character-based representation appear to have a formidable mixing of the four nucleotides without any apparent order. Nucleotide frequencies and distributions in the sequences have been studied extensively, since the simple rule given by Chargaff almost a century ago that equates the total number of purines to the pyrimidines in a duplex DNA sequence. While it is difficult to trace any relationship between the bases from studies in the character representation of a DNA sequence, graphical representations may provide a clue. These novel representations of DNA sequences have been useful in providing an overview of base distribution and composition of the sequences and providing insights into many hidden structures. We report here our observation based on a graphical representation that the intra-purine and intra-pyrimidine differences in sequences of conserved genes generally follow a quadratic distribution relationship and show that this may have arisen from mutations in the sequences over evolutionary time scales. From this hitherto undescribed relationship for the gene sequences considered in this report we hypothesize that such relationships may be characteristic of these sequences and therefore could become a barrier to large scale sequence alterations that override such characteristics, perhaps through some monitoring process inbuilt in the DNA sequences. Such relationship also raises the possibility of intron sequences playing an important role in maintaining the characteristics and could be indicative of possible intron-late phenomena.","Nandy, Ashesh",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730015/,21
572,"Temporal Analysis of the Honey Bee Microbiome Reveals Four Novel Viruses and Seasonal Prevalence of Known Viruses, Nosema, and Crithidia",2011-06-07,"Honey bees (Apis mellifera) play a critical role in global food production as pollinators of numerous crops. Recently, honey bee populations in the United States, Canada, and Europe have suffered an unexplained increase in annual losses due to a phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Epidemiological analysis of CCD is confounded by a relative dearth of bee pathogen field studies. To identify what constitutes an abnormal pathophysiological condition in a honey bee colony, it is critical to have characterized the spectrum of exogenous infectious agents in healthy hives over time. We conducted a prospective study of a large scale migratory bee keeping operation using high-frequency sampling paired with comprehensive molecular detection methods, including a custom microarray, qPCR, and ultra deep sequencing. We established seasonal incidence and abundance of known viruses, Nosema sp., Crithidia mellificae, and bacteria. Ultra deep sequence analysis further identified four novel RNA viruses, two of which were the most abundant observed components of the honey bee microbiome (∼10(11) viruses per honey bee). Our results demonstrate episodic viral incidence and distinct pathogen patterns between summer and winter time-points. Peak infection of common honey bee viruses and Nosema occurred in the summer, whereas levels of the trypanosomatid Crithidia mellificae and Lake Sinai virus 2, a novel virus, peaked in January.","Runckel, Charles; Flenniken, Michelle L.; Engel, Juan C.; Ruby, J.

624,NoD: a Nucleolar localization sequence detector for eukaryotic and viral proteins,2011-08-03,"BACKGROUND: Nucleolar localization sequences (NoLSs) are short targeting sequences responsible for the localization of proteins to the nucleolus. Given the large number of proteins experimentally detected in the nucleolus and the central role of this subnuclear compartment in the cell, NoLSs are likely to be important regulatory elements controlling cellular traffic. Although many proteins have been reported to contain NoLSs, the systematic characterization of this group of targeting motifs has only recently been carried out. RESULTS: Here, we describe NoD, a web server and a command line program that predicts the presence of NoLSs in proteins. Using the web server, users can submit protein sequences through the NoD input form and are provided with a graphical output of the NoLS score as a function of protein position. While the web server is most convenient for making prediction for just a few proteins, the command line version of NoD can return predictions for complete proteomes. NoD is based on our recently described human-trained artificial neural network predictor. Through stringent independent testing of the predictor using available experimentally validated NoLS-containing eukaryotic and viral proteins, the NoD sensitivity and positive predictive value were estimated to be 71% and 79% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NoD is the first tool to provide predictions of nucleolar localization sequences in diverse eukaryotes and viruses. NoD can be run interactively online at http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/nod or downloaded to use locally.","Scott, Michelle S; Troshin, Peter V; Barton, Geoffrey J",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166288/,21
1096,A novel submicron emulsion system loaded with vincristine–oleic acid ion-pair complex with improved anticancer effect: in vitro and in vivo studies,2013-03-20,"BACKGROUND: Vincristine (VCR), which is a widely used antineoplastic drug, was integrated with a submicron-emulsion drug-delivery system to enhance the anticancer effect. METHODS: After the formation of a VCR-oleic acid ion-pair complex (VCR-OA), the VCR-OA-loaded submicron emulsion (VCR-OA-SME), prepared by classical high-pressure homogenization, was characterized and its in vitro anticancer effects were evaluated. RESULTS: The submicron-emulsion formulation exhibited a homogeneous round shape. The mean particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency were 157.6 ± 12.6 nm, −26.5 ± 5.0 mV and 78.64% ± 3.44%, respectively. An in vitro release study of the VCR-OA-SME revealed that 12.4% of the VCR was released within the first 2 hours (initial burst-release phase) and the rest of the drug was detected in the subsequent sustained-release phase. Compared with VCR solution, the pharmacokinetic study of VCR-OA-SME showed relatively longer mean residence time (mean residence time [0–∞] increased from 187.19 to 227.56 minutes), higher maximum concentration (from 252.13 ng/mL to 533.34 ng/mL), and greater area under the curve (area under the curve [0–∞] from 11,417.77 μg/L/minute to 17,164.34 μg/L/minute. Moreover, the VCR-OA-SME exhibited higher cytotoxicity (P < 0.05) on tumor cells by inducing cell arrest in the G2/M phase or even apoptosis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The VCR-OA-SME formulation in our study displayed great potential for an anticancer effect for VCR.","Zhang, Ting; Zheng, Yong; Peng, Qiang; Cao, Xi; Gong, Tao; Zhang, Zhirong",Int J Nanomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3607420/,21
1247,Isolation and identification of feline calicivirus and feline herpesvirus in Southern Brazil,2012-06-01,"Feline calicivirus (FCV) and feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) are the two primary causes of upper respiratory tract disease in cats. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the distribution of FCV and FHV-1 among the feline population of several counties in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. To this end, conjunctival and nasal swabs were collected from 302 cats from different locations, including households, breeding catteries, veterinary clinics, animal hospitals and experimental research facilities. The samples were collected between July 2006 to June 2009. The virus isolation was performed in CRFK cells and, subsequently, the identification was confirmed by PCR. FCV, FHV-1, or both were isolated from 55 cats from 28 different locations. FCV alone was isolated from 52.7% (29/55) of the animals that tested positively, FHV-1 alone was isolated from 38.2% (21/55) of the animals that tested positively, and co-infection were detected in 9.1% (5/55) of the animals that tested positively. Virus detection was more prevalent in cats that were less than 1 year old, among animals that shared a living space with other cats, and females. FCV and FHV-1 were isolated from vaccinated cats. In addition, both viruses were isolated from cats that showed no signs of disease. The results suggest that a carrier state is common for both viruses in the evaluated population. A search for other causes of respiratory disease in that population is necessary; and further studies relating to the molecular characterization of viruses and vaccine efficacy are also necessary.","Henzel, Andréia; Brum, Mário Celso Sperotto; Lautert, Cláudia; Martins, Mathias; Lovato, Luciane Teresinha; Weiblen, Rudi",Braz J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768834/,21
1474,Molecular Phylogeny of Hantaviruses Harbored by Insectivorous Bats in Côte d’Ivoire and Vietnam,2014-04-29,"The recent discovery of genetically distinct hantaviruses in multiple species of shrews and moles prompted a further exploration of their host diversification by analyzing frozen, ethanol-fixed and RNAlater(®)-preserved archival tissues and fecal samples from 533 bats (representing seven families, 28 genera and 53 species in the order Chiroptera), captured in Asia, Africa and the Americas in 1981–2012, using RT-PCR. Hantavirus RNA was detected in Pomona roundleaf bats (Hipposideros pomona) (family Hipposideridae), captured in Vietnam in 1997 and 1999, and in banana pipistrelles (Neoromicia nanus) (family Vespertilionidae), captured in Côte d’Ivoire in 2011. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the full-length S- and partial M- and L-segment sequences using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, demonstrated that the newfound hantaviruses formed highly divergent lineages, comprising other recently recognized bat-borne hantaviruses in Sierra Leone and China.

1531,Construction of fat1 Gene Expression Vector and Its Catalysis Efficiency in Bovine Fetal Fibroblast Cells,2012-05-01,"The FAT-1 protein is an n-3 fatty acid desaturase, which can recognize a range of 18- and 20-carbon n-6 substrates and transform n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) into n-3 PUFAs while n-3 PUFAs have beneficial effect on human health. Fat1 gene is the coding sequence from Caenorhabditis elegans which might play an important role on lipometabolism. To reveal the function of fat1 gene in bovine fetal fibroblast cells and gain the best cell nuclear donor for transgenic bovines, the codon of fat1 sequence was optimized based on the codon usage frequency preference of bovine muscle protein, and directionally cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pEF-GFP. After identifying by restrictive enzyme digests with AatII/XbaI and sequencing, the fusion plasmid pEF-GFP-fat1 was identified successfully. The pEF-GFP-fat1 vector was transfected into bovine fetal fibroblast cells mediated by Lipofectamine2000(TM). The positive bovine fetal fibroblast cells were selected by G418 and detected by RT-PCR. The results showed that a 1,234 bp transcription was amplified by reverse transcription PCR and the positive transgenic fat1 cell line was successfully established. Then the expression level of fat1 gene in positive cells was detected using quantitative PCR, and the catalysis efficiency was detected by gas chromatography. The results demonstrated that the catalysis efficiency of fat1 was significantly high, which can improve the total PUFAs rich in EPA, DHA and DPA. Construction and expression of pEF-GFP-fat1 vector should be helpful for further understanding the mechanism of regulation of fat1 in vitro. It could also be the first step in the production of fat1 transgenic cattle.","Liu, Boyang; Yang, Runjun; Li, Junya; Zhang, Lupei; Liu, Jing; Lu, Chunyan; Lian, Chuanjiang; Li, Zezhong; Zhang, Yonghong; Zhang, Liying; Zhao, Zhihui",Asian-Australas J Anim Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4093122/,21
1547,Recombinant Scorpine Produced Using SUMO Fusion Partner in Escherichia coli Has the Activities against Clinically Isolated Bacteria and Inhibits the Plasmodium falciparum Parasitemia In Vitro,2014-07-28,"Scorpine, a small cationic peptide from the venom of Pandinus imperator, which has been shown to have anti-bacterial and anti-plasmodial activities, has potential important applications in the pharmaceutical industries. However, the isolation of scorpine from natural sources is inefficient and time-consuming. Here, we first report the expression and purification of recombinant scorpine in Escherichia coli, using small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) fusion partner. The fusion protein was expressed in soluble form in E. coli, and expression was verified by SDS-PAGE and western blotting analysis. The fusion protein was purified to 90% purity by nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni(2+)–NTA) resin chromatography. After the SUMO-scorpine fusion protein was cleaved by the SUMO protease, the cleaved sample was reapplied to a Ni(2+)–NTA column. Tricine/SDS-PAGE gel results indicated that Scorpine had been purified successfully to more than 95% purity. The recombinantly expressed Scorpine showed anti-bacterial activity against two standard bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, and clinically isolated bacteria including S. aureus S, S. aureus R, A. baumannii S, and A. baumannii R. It also produced 100% reduction in Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in vitro. Thus, the expression strategy presented in this study allowed convenient high yield and easy purification of recombinant Scorpine for pharmaceutical applications in the future.","Zhang, Chao; He, Xinlong; Gu, Yaping; Zhou, Huayun; Cao, Jun; Gao, Qi",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4113386/,21
1623,Arenavirus Stable Signal Peptide Is the Keystone Subunit for Glycoprotein Complex Organization,2014-10-28,"The rodent arenavirus glycoprotein complex encodes a stable signal peptide (SSP) that is an essential structural component of mature virions. The SSP, GP1, and GP2 subunits of the trimeric glycoprotein complex noncovalently interact to stud the surface of virions and initiate arenavirus infectivity. Nascent glycoprotein production undergoes two proteolytic cleavage events: first within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to cleave SSP from the remaining precursor GP1/2 (glycoprotein complex [GPC]) glycoprotein and second within the Golgi stacks by the cellular SKI-1/S1P for GP1/2 processing to yield GP1 and GP2 subunits. Cleaved SSP is not degraded but retained as an essential glycoprotein subunit. Here, we defined functions of the 58-amino-acid lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) SSP in regard to glycoprotein complex processing and maturation. Using molecular biology techniques, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry, we detected SSP at the plasma membrane of transfected cells. Further, we identified a sorting signal (FLLL) near the carboxyl terminus of SSP that is required for glycoprotein maturation and trafficking. In the absence of SSP, the glycoprotein accumulated within the ER and was unable to undergo processing by SKI-1/S1P. Mutation of this highly conserved FLLL motif showed impaired glycoprotein processing and secretory pathway trafficking, as well as defective surface expression and pH-dependent membrane fusion. Immunoprecipitation of SSP confirmed an interaction between the signal peptide and the GP2 subunit; however, mutations within this FLLL motif disrupted the association of the GP1 subunit with the remaining glycoprotein complex.","Bederka, Lydia H.; Bonhomme, Cyrille J.; Ling, Emily L.; Buchmeier, Michael J.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4217180/,21

2048,Salmonella enterica Serovars Enteritidis Infection Alters the Indigenous Microbiota Diversity in Young Layer Chicks,2015-11-23,"Avian gastrointestinal (GI) tracts are highly populated with a diverse array of microorganisms that share a symbiotic relationship with their hosts and contribute to the overall health and disease state of the intestinal tract. The microbiome of the young chick is easily prone to alteration in its composition by both exogenous and endogenous factors, especially during the early posthatch period. The genetic background of the host and exposure to pathogens can impact the diversity of the microbial profile that consequently contributes to the disease progression in the host. The objective of this study was to profile the composition and structure of the gut microbiota in young chickens from two genetically distinct highly inbred lines. Furthermore, the effect of the Salmonella Enteritidis infection on altering the composition makeup of the chicken microbiome was evaluated through the 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. One-day-old layer chicks were challenged with S. Enteritidis and the host cecal microbiota profile as well as the degree of susceptibility to Salmonella infection was examined at 2 and 7 days post infection. Our result indicated that host genotype had a limited effect on resistance to S. Enteritidis infection. Alpha diversity, beta diversity, and overall microbiota composition were analyzed for four factors: host genotype, age, treatment, and postinfection time points. S. Enteritidis infection in young chicks was found to significantly reduce the overall diversity of the microbiota population with expansion of Enterobacteriaceae family. These changes indicated that Salmonella colonization in the GI tract of the chickens has a direct effect on altering the natural development of the GI microbiota. The impact of S. Enteritidis infection on microbial communities was also more substantial in the late stage of infection. Significant inverse correlation between Enterobacteriaceae and Lachnospiraceae family in both non-infected and infected groups, suggested possible antagonistic interaction between members of these two taxa, which could potentially influences the overall microbial population in the gut. Our results also revealed that genetic difference between two lines had minimal effect on the establishment of microbiota population. Overall, this study provided preliminary insights into the contributing role of S. Enteritidis in influencing the overall makeup of chicken’s gut microbiota.","Mon, Khin K.

2084,Heterologous Immunity between Adenoviruses and Hepatitis C Virus: A New Paradigm in HCV Immunity and Vaccines,2016-01-11,"Adenoviruses (Ad) are commonly used as vectors for gene therapy and/or vaccine delivery. Recombinant Ad vectors are being tested as vaccines for many pathogens. We have made a surprising observation that peptides derived from various hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigens contain extensive regions of homology with multiple adenovirus proteins, and conclusively demonstrate that adenovirus vector can induce robust, heterologous cellular and humoral immune responses against multiple HCV antigens. Intriguingly, the induction of this cross-reactive immunity leads to significant reduction of viral loads in a recombinant vaccinia-HCV virus infected mouse model, supporting their role in antiviral immunity against HCV. Healthy human subjects with Ad-specific pre-existing immunity demonstrated cross-reactive cellular and humoral immune responses against multiple HCV antigens. These findings reveal the potential of a previously uncharacterized property of natural human adenovirus infection to dictate, modulate and/or alter the course of HCV infection upon exposure. This intrinsic property of adenovirus vectors to cross-prime HCV immunity can also be exploited to develop a prophylactic and/or therapeutic vaccine against HCV.","Singh, Shakti; Vedi, Satish; Samrat, Subodh Kumar; Li, Wen; Kumar, Rakesh; Agrawal, Babita",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4709057/,21
2177,Evolutionary reversion of live viral vaccines: Can genetic engineering subdue it?,2015-07-31,"Attenuated, live viral vaccines have been extraordinarily successful in protecting against many diseases. The main drawbacks in their development and use have been reliance on an unpredictable method of attenuation and the potential for evolutionary reversion to high virulence. Methods of genetic engineering now provide many safer alternatives to live vaccines, so if live vaccines are to compete with these alternatives in the future, they must either have superior immunogenicity or they must be able to overcome these former disadvantages. Several live vaccine designs that were historically inaccessible are now feasible because of advances in genome synthesis. Some of those methods are addressed here, with an emphasis on whether they enable predictable levels of attenuation and whether they are stable against evolutionary reversion. These new designs overcome many of the former drawbacks and position live vaccines to be competitive with alternatives. Not only do new methods appear to retard evolutionary reversion enough to prevent vaccine-derived epidemics, but it may even be possible to permanently attenuate live vaccines that are transmissible but cannot evolve to higher virulence under prolonged adaptation.","Bull, J.

2215,Identification of a Peptide Produced by Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7210 with Antirotaviral Activity,2016-05-04,"Rotavirus is one of the main causes of acute diarrhea and enteritis in infants. Currently, studies are underway to assess the use of probiotics to improve rotavirus vaccine protection. A previous work demonstrated that the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis CECT 7210 is able to hinder rotavirus replication both in vitro and in vivo. The present study takes a systematic approach in order to identify the molecule directly involved in rotavirus inhibition. Supernatant protease digestions revealed both the proteinaceous nature of the active substance and the fact that the molecule responsible for inhibiting rotavirus replication is released to the supernatant. Following purification by cationic exchange chromatography, active fractions were obtained and the functional compound was identified as an 11-amino acid peptide (MHQPHQPLPPT, named 11-mer peptide) with a molecular mass of 1.282 KDa.

Notably, the development of replicating-competent reporter-expressing viruses (RCREVs) has provided an excellent option to detect directly viral replication without the use of secondary labeling, which represents a significant advance in virology. This article reviews the applications of RCREVs in diagnostic and molecular virology, including rapid neutralization tests, high-throughput screening systems, identification of viral receptors and virus-host interactions, dynamics of viral infections in vitro and in vivo, vaccination approaches and others. However, there remain various challenges associated with RCREVs, including pathogenicity alterations due to the insertion of a reporter gene, instability or loss of the reporter gene expression, or attenuation of reporter signals in vivo. Despite all these limitations, RCREVs have become powerful tools for both basic and applied virology with the development of new technologies for generating RCREVs, the inventions of novel reporters and the better understanding of regulation of viral replication.","Li, Yongfeng; Li, Lian-Feng; Yu, Shaoxiong; Wang, Xiao; Zhang, Lingkai; Yu, Jiahui; Xie, Libao; Li, Weike; Ali, Razim; Qiu, Hua-Ji",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885082/,21
2277,Transgenic Soybean Production of Bioactive Human Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF),2016-06-17,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating condition of premature infants that results from the gut microbiome invading immature intestinal tissues. This results in a life-threatening disease that is frequently treated with the surgical removal of diseased and dead tissues. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), typically found in bodily fluids, such as amniotic fluid, salvia and mother’s breast milk, is an intestinotrophic growth factor and may reduce the onset of NEC in premature infants. We have produced human EGF in soybean seeds to levels biologically relevant and demonstrated its comparable activity to commercially available EGF. Transgenic soybean seeds expressing a seed-specific codon optimized gene encoding of the human EGF protein with an added ER signal tag at the N’ terminal were produced. Seven independent lines were grown to homozygous and found to accumulate a range of 6.7 +/- 3.1 to 129.0 +/- 36.7 μg EGF/g of dry soybean seed. Proteomic and immunoblot analysis indicates that the inserted EGF is the same as the human EGF protein. Phosphorylation and immunohistochemical assays on the EGF receptor in HeLa cells indicate the EGF protein produced in soybean seed is bioactive and comparable to commercially available human EGF. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using soybean seeds as a biofactory to produce therapeutic agents in a soymilk delivery platform.","He, Yonghua; Schmidt, Monica A.; Erwin, Christopher; Guo, Jun; Sun, Raphael; Pendarvis, Ken; Warner, Brad W.; Herman, Eliot M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4912142/,21
2656,Non-canonical Translation in Plant RNA Viruses,2017-04-06,"Viral protein synthesis is completely dependent upon the host cell's translational machinery. Canonical translation of host mRNAs depends on structural elements such as the 5′ cap structure and/or the 3′ poly(A) tail of the mRNAs. Although many viral mRNAs are devoid of one or both of these structures, they can still translate efficiently using non-canonical mechanisms. Here, we review the tools utilized by positive-sense single-stranded (+ss) RNA plant viruses to initiate non-canonical translation, focusing on cis-acting sequences present in viral mRNAs. We highlight how these elements may interact with host translation factors and speculate on their contribution for achieving translational control. We also describe other translation strategies used by plant viruses to optimize the usage of the coding capacity of their very compact genomes, including leaky scanning initiation, ribosomal frameshifting and stop-codon readthrough. Finally, future research perspectives on the unusual translational strategies of +ssRNA viruses are discussed, including parallelisms between viral and host mRNAs mechanisms of translation, particularly for host mRNAs which are translated under stress conditions.","Miras, Manuel; Miller, W.

2699,Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic Virus,2014-04-17,"Oncolytic virotherapy has advanced since the days of its conception but therapeutic efficacy in the clinics does not seem to reach the same level as in animal models. One reason is premature oncolytic virus clearance in humans, which is a reasonable assumption considering the immune-stimulating nature of the oncolytic agents. However, several studies are beginning to reveal layers of restriction to oncolytic virotherapy that are present before an adaptive neutralizing immune response. Some of these barriers are present constitutively halting infection before it even begins, whereas others are raised by minute cues triggered by virus infection. Indeed, we and others have noticed that delivering viruses to tumors may not be the biggest obstacle to successful therapy, but instead the physical make-up of the tumor and its capacity to mount antiviral defenses seem to be the most important efficacy determinants. In this review, we summarize the constitutive and innate barriers to oncolytic virotherapy and discuss strategies to overcome them.","Vähä-Koskela, Markus; Hinkkanen, Ari",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5423468/,21
2730,Accurate characterization of the IFITM locus using MiSeq and PacBio sequencing shows genetic variation in Galliformes,2017-05-30,"BACKGROUND: Interferon inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are effectors of the immune system widely characterized for their role in restricting infection by diverse enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. The chicken IFITM (chIFITM) genes are clustered on chromosome 5 and to date four genes have been annotated, namely chIFITM1, chIFITM3, chIFITM5 and chIFITM10. However, due to poor assembly of this locus in the Gallus Gallus v4 genome, accurate characterization has so far proven problematic. Recently, a new chicken reference genome assembly Gallus Gallus v5 was generated using Sanger, 454, Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies identifying considerable differences in the chIFITM locus over the previous genome releases. METHODS: We re-sequenced the locus using both Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RS II sequencing technologies and we mapped RNA-seq data from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) to this finalized chIFITM locus. Using SureSelect probes capture probes designed to the finalized chIFITM locus, we sequenced the locus of a different chicken breed, namely a White Leghorn, and a turkey. RESULTS: We confirmed the Gallus Gallus v5 consensus except for two insertions of 5 and 1 base pair within the chIFITM3 and B4GALNT4 genes, respectively, and a single base pair deletion within the B4GALNT4 gene. The pull down revealed a single amino acid substitution of A63V in the CIL domain of IFITM2 compared to Red Jungle fowl and 13, 13 and 11 differences between IFITM1, 2 and 3 of chickens and turkeys, respectively. RNA-seq shows chIFITM2 and chIFITM3 expression in numerous tissue types of different chicken breeds and avian cell lines, while the expression of the putative chIFITM1 is limited to the testis, caecum and ileum tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Locus resequencing using these capture probes and RNA-seq based expression analysis will allow the further characterization of genetic diversity within Galliformes.

Here we show that V-set immunoglobulin-domain-containing 4 (VSIG4), a B7 family-related protein that is expressed by resting macrophages, inhibits macrophage activation in response to lipopolysaccharide. Vsig4 (−/−) mice are susceptible to high-fat diet-caused obesity and murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3)-induced fulminant hepatitis due to excessive macrophage-dependent inflammation. VSIG4 activates the PI3K/Akt–STAT3 pathway, leading to pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-2 (PDK2) upregulation and subsequent phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which results in reduction in pyruvate/acetyl-CoA conversion, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species secretion, and macrophage inhibition. Conversely, interruption of Vsig4 or Pdk2 promotes inflammation. Forced expression of Vsig4 in mice ameliorates MHV-3-induced viral fulminant hepatitis. These data show that VSIG4 negatively regulates macrophage activation by reprogramming mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism.","Li, Jialin; Diao, Bo; Guo, Sheng; Huang, Xiaoyong; Yang, Chengying; Feng, Zeqing; Yan, Weiming; Ning, Qin; Zheng, Lixin; Chen, Yongwen; Wu, Yuzhang",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5673889/,21
2938,Intrinsically disordered sequences enable modulation of protein phase separation through distributed tyrosine motifs,2017-11-17,"Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) is thought to contribute to the establishment of many biomolecular condensates, eukaryotic cell structures that concentrate diverse macromolecules but lack a bounding membrane. RNA granules control RNA metabolism and comprise a large class of condensates that are enriched in RNA-binding proteins and RNA molecules. Many RNA granule proteins are composed of both modular domains and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) having low amino acid sequence complexity. Phase separation of these molecules likely plays an important role in the generation and stability of RNA granules. To understand how folded domains and IDRs can cooperate to modulate LLPS, we generated a series of engineered proteins. These were based on fusions of an IDR derived from the RNA granule protein FUS (fused in sarcoma) to a multivalent poly-Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that phase-separates when mixed with a poly-proline–rich-motif (polyPRM) ligand. We found that the wild-type IDR promotes LLPS of the polySH3–polyPRM system, decreasing the phase separation threshold concentration by 8-fold. Systematic mutation of tyrosine residues in Gly/Ser-Tyr-Gly/Ser motifs of the IDR reduced this effect, depending on the number but not on the position of these substitutions. Mutating all tyrosines to non-aromatic residues or phosphorylating the IDR raised the phase separation threshold above that of the unmodified polySH3–polyPRM pair. These results show that low-complexity IDRs can modulate LLPS both positively and negatively, depending on the degree of aromaticity and phosphorylation status. Our findings provide plausible mechanisms by which these sequences could alter RNA granule properties on evolutionary and cellular timescales.","Lin, Yuan; Currie, Simon L.; Rosen, Michael K.",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5704491/,21

Pure aluminum (Al, 300 nm) was coated on glass slides via electron-beam vapor deposition polymerization (VDP), followed by anodization to form a thin layer (50–65 nm) of aluminum oxide (Al-oxide) on the surface. The ACG slides prepared this way provide a smooth surface for arraying sugars covalently via phosphonate formation with controlled density and spatial distance. To evaluate this array system, a mannose derivative of α-5-pentylphosphonic acid was used as a model for the optimization of covalent arraying based on the fluorescence response of the surface mannose interacting with concanavalin A (ConA) tagged with the fluorescence probe A488. The ACG slide was characterized using scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and ellipsometry, and the sugar loading capacity, uniformity, and structural conformation were also characterized using AFM, a GenePix scanner, and a confocal microscope. This study has demonstrated that the glycan array prepared from the ACG slide is more homogeneous with better spatial control compared with the commonly used glycan array prepared from the N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated glass slide.","Tseng, Susan Yu; Cho, Wen-Hao; Su, James; Chang, Shih-Huang; Chiang, Donyau; Wu, Chung-Yi; Hsiao, Chien-Nan; Wong, Chi-Huey",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6044682/,21
3315,Virus-Receptor Interactions: The Key to Cellular Invasion,2018-08-01,"Virus-receptor interactions play a key regulatory role in viral host range, tissue tropism, and viral pathogenesis. Viruses utilize elegant strategies to attach to one or multiple receptors, overcome the plasma membrane barrier, enter, and access the necessary host cell machinery. The viral attachment protein can be viewed as the “key” that unlocks host cells by interacting with the “lock” – the receptor – on the cell surface, and these lock-and-key interactions are critical for viruses to successfully invade host cells. Many common themes have emerged in virus receptor utilization within and across virus families demonstrating that viruses often target particular classes of molecules in order to mediate these events. Common viral receptors include sialylated glycans, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) such as immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) members and integrins, and phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) receptors. The redundancy in receptor usage suggests that viruses target particular receptors or “common locks” to take advantage of their cellular function and also suggests evolutionary conservation. Due to the importance of initial virus interactions with host cells in viral pathogenesis and the redundancy in viral receptor usage, exploitation o f these strategies would be an attractive target for new antiviral therapeutics.","Maginnis, Melissa S.",Journal of Molecular Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6083867/,21

In the last few years, genomic and molecular investigations have established a remarkable progress on the pathogenic mechanisms of ZIKV infection using in vitro and in vivo models. Here, we highlight recent advances in ZIKV-host cell interaction studies, including cellular targets of ZIKV, ZIKV-mediated cell death mechanisms, host cell restriction factors that limit ZIKV replication, and immune evasion mechanisms utilized by ZIKV.

The recent large outbreak of EVD in Western Africa (2013–2016) highlighted the worldwide threat represented by the disease and its impact on global public health and the economy. The development of highly needed anti-Ebola virus antivirals has been so far hampered by the shortage of tools to study their life cycle in vitro, allowing to screen for potential active compounds outside a biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) containment. Importantly, the development of surrogate models to study Ebola virus entry in a BSL-2 setting, such as viral pseudotypes and Ebola virus-like particles, tremendously boosted both our knowledge of the viral life cycle and the identification of promising antiviral compounds interfering with viral entry. In this context, the combination of such surrogate systems with large-scale small molecule compounds and haploid genetic screenings, as well as rational drug design and drug repurposing approaches will prove priceless in our quest for the development of a treatment for EVD.","Salata, Cristiano; Calistri, Arianna; Alvisi, Gualtiero; Celestino, Michele; Parolin, Cristina; Palù, Giorgio",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6466262/,21
3875,Improved phylogenomic sampling of free-living nematodes enhances resolution of higher-level nematode phylogeny,2019-06-13,"BACKGROUND: Nematodes are among the most diverse and abundant metazoans on Earth, but research on them has been biased toward parasitic taxa and model organisms. Free-living nematodes, particularly from the clades Enoplia and Dorylaimia, have been underrepresented in genome-scale phylogenetic analyses to date, leading to poor resolution of deep relationships within the phylum. RESULTS: We supplemented publicly available data by sequencing transcriptomes of nine free-living nematodes and two important outgroups and conducted a phylum-wide phylogenomic analysis including a total of 108 nematodes. Analysis of a dataset generated using a conservative orthology inference strategy resulted in a matrix with a high proportion of missing data and moderate to weak support for branching within and placement of Enoplia. A less conservative orthology inference approach recovered more genes and resulted in higher support for the deepest splits within Nematoda, recovering Enoplia as the sister taxon to the rest of Nematoda. Relationships within major clades were similar to those found in previously published studies based on 18S rDNA. CONCLUSIONS: Expanded transcriptome sequencing of free-living nematodes has contributed to better resolution among deep nematode lineages, though the dataset is still strongly biased toward parasites. Inclusion of more free-living nematodes in future phylogenomic analyses will allow a clearer understanding of many interesting aspects of nematode evolution, such as morphological and molecular adaptations to parasitism and whether nematodes originated in a marine or terrestrial environment.

Genetic association studies can potentially identify such interactions. However, extensive and correlated genetic population structure in hosts and pathogens presents a substantial risk of confounding analyses. Moreover, the multiple testing burden of interaction scanning can potentially limit power. We present a Bayesian approach for detecting host influences on pathogen evolution that exploits vast existing data sets of pathogen diversity to improve power and control for stratification. The approach models key processes, including recombination and selection, and identifies regions of the pathogen genome affected by host factors. Our simulations and empirical analysis of drug-induced selection on the HIV-1 genome show that the method recovers known associations and has superior precision-recall characteristics compared to other approaches.

Here, we carried out genomic analyses to identify Aedes aegypti miRNAs that potentially interact with various lineages and genotypes of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses. By using prediction tools with distinct algorithms, several miRNA binding sites were commonly found within different genotypes/and or lineages of each arbovirus. We further analyzed those miRNAs that could target more than one arbovirus, required a low energy threshold to form miRNA-viralRNA (vRNA) complexes, and predicted potential RNA structures using RNAhybrid software. We predicted miRNA candidates that might participate in regulating arboviral replication in Ae. aegypti. Even without any experimental validation, which should be done as a next step, this study can shed further light on the role of miRNA in mosquito innate immunity and targets for future studies.","Yen, Pei-Shi; Chen, Chun-Hong; Sreenu, Vattipally; Kohl, Alain; Failloux, Anna-Bella",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631873/,21

Biomolecules in complex matrices could be separated by MCE and sequentially detected by MS. The effective radius and the aspect ratio of each separated biomolecule were simultaneously determined through the separation by MCE, which were then used as restraints in determining biomolecule conformations through modeling. Feasibility of this method was verified by analyzing a mixture of somatostatin and bradykinin, two peptides with known liquid-phase structures. Proteins could also be structurally analyzed using this method, which was demonstrated for lysozyme. The combination of MCE and MS for complex sample analysis was also demonstrated.

ZIKV Natal RGN strain, an Asian-lineage virus, has been identified in brain tissues from fetal autopsy cases with microcephaly and is suggested to be a neurotropic variant. However, ZIKV Natal RGN strain has not been isolated; its biological features are not yet illustrated. This study rescued and characterized recombinant, single-round infectious particles (SRIPs) of the ZIKV Natal RGN strain using reverse genetic and synthetic biology techniques. The DNA-launched replicon of ZIKV Natal RGN was constructed and contains the EGFP reporter, lacks prM-E genes, and replicates under CMV promoter control.

The infectivity of ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs has been demonstrated to correlate with the green florescence intensity of the EGFP reporter, the SRIP-induced cytopathic effect, and ZIKV’s non-structural protein expression. Moreover, ZIKV Natal RGN SRIPs effectively self-replicated in rhabdomyosarcoma/muscle, glioblastoma/astrocytoma, and retinal pigmented epithelial cells, displaying unique cell susceptibility with differential attachment activity.

Here we focus on the role of Siglec-1, a sialic acid-binding type I lectin receptor potently upregulated by type I interferons on DCs, that acts as a double edge sword, containing viral replication through the induction of antiviral immunity, but also favoring viral spread within tissues. Such is the case for distant enveloped viruses like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or Ebola virus (EBOV), which incorporate sialic acid-containing gangliosides on their viral membrane and are effectively recognized by Siglec-1. Here we review how Siglec-1 is highly induced on the surface of human DCs upon viral infection, the way this impacts different antigen presentation pathways, and how enveloped viruses have evolved to exploit these APC functions as a potent dissemination strategy in different anatomical compartments.","Perez-Zsolt, Daniel; Martinez-Picado, Javier; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7019426/,21
4510,Systematic selection between age and household structure for models aimed at emerging epidemic predictions,2020-02-14,"HTLV-1 was the first described human retrovirus and was soon found to be associated with severe clinical diseases, including a devastating lymphoma/leukemia and other inflammatory diseases. Although HTLV-2 is not usually pathogenic, it is widely distributed among native Indian populations in Brazil, particularly in the Amazon region of the country. Presently, HTLV spreads mainly by the sexual route and from mother to child, and virus persistence is an active biological factor aiding its transmission. Recently, the use of illicit drugs has been shown to be an additional risk factor, showing the influence of new habits on the epidemiology of HTLV in the region. Despite the detection of the virus in several different populations in the Amazon region of Brazil for almost 30 years, the exact prevalence of HTLV-1/2 is not well defined. The original biases in sampling and the selection of epidemiologically unsuitable populations were commonly repeated in most prevalence studies, generating unreliable and conflicting figures that do not represent the actual prevalence of HTLV. The improvements in clinical and laboratory facilities have resulted in the description of several clinical manifestations that were previously unknown in the region. The extent of the spread of the virus must be defined in this region, which is the largest geographical area of the country. As prophylaxis advances toward the use of vaccines against HTLV-1, it is important to determine who is at risk of being infected and developing a disease to successfully implement preventive measures, particularly as proposals are made to eradicate the virus among humans.","Ishak, Ricardo; de Oliveira Guimarães Ishak, Marluísa; Vallinoto, Antonio Carlos R.",Retrovirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023703/,21
4511,Cell Membrane-Interrupting Antimicrobial Peptides from Isatis indigotica Fortune Isolated by a Bacillus subtilis Expression System,2019-12-24,"BACKGROUND: The number of children requiring long-term home ventilation has consistently increased over the last 25 years. Given the growing population of children with complex care needs (CCNs), this was an important area of focus within the Models of Child Health Appraised (MOCHA) project, funded by the European Union (EU) under the Horizon 2020 programme. We examined the structures and processes of care in place for children with CCNs and identified key constituents for effective integration of care for these children at the community and acute care interface across 30 EU/ European Economic Area (EEA) countries. METHODS: This was a non-experimental descriptive study with an embedded qualitative element. Data were collected by a Country Agent in each of the 30 countries, a local expert in child health services. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and a thematic analysis was undertaken of the free text data provided. RESULTS: A total of 27 surveys were returned from a possible 30 countries (90.0%) countries. One respondent indicated that their country does not have children on long-term ventilation (LTV) in the home, therefore, responses of 26 countries (86.7%) were analysed. None of the responding countries reported that they had all of the core components in place in their country. Three themes emerged from the free text provided: ‘family preparedness for transitioning to home’, ‘coordinated pathway to specialist care’ and ‘legal and governance structures’. CONCLUSIONS: While the clinical care of children on LTV in the acute sector has received considerable attention, the results identify the need for an enhanced focus on the care required following discharge to the community setting. The results highlight the need for a commitment to supporting care delivery that acknowledges the complexity of contemporary child health issues and the context of the families that become their primary care givers.","Brenner, Maria; O’Shea, Miriam P.; Larkin, Philip; Berry, Jay",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023713/,21

The present study aimed to evaluate and compare the probiotic potential and safety of LAB strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of a wild boar from the Greater Khingan Mountains, China. Amongst all of the isolated LAB strains, five isolates identified as Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus salivarius, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, and Enterococcus faecium, were remarkably resistant to acid and bile salt. The probiotic characteristics (including adhesion capability, antimicrobial activities, autoaggregation, and coaggregation abilities), and safety properties (including hemolytic activity, antibiotic resistance, absence/presence of virulence factors, and in vivo safety) were evaluated. The results showed that all five isolates exhibited high adhesive potential, remarkable aggregation capacity, and antibacterial activities. Upon assessment of the safety, these strains were negative for hemolytic activity and all tested virulence genes. In vivo safety assessment showed no adverse effects of isolated strains supplementation on the body weight gain and organ indices of the treated mice. This study revealed that these LAB isolates, especially L. salivarius M2-71, possess desirable probiotic properties and have great potentials for the development of feed additives for animals to promote health.","Li, Miao; Wang, Yi; Cui, Hongyu; Li, Yongfeng; Sun, Yuan; Qiu, Hua-Ji",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7026679/,21
4518,Characterization of Lactic Acid Bacteria Isolated From the Gastrointestinal Tract of a Wild Boar as Potential Probiotics,2020-02-11,"BACKGROUND: Optimal antimicrobial drug exposure in the lung is required for successful treatment outcomes for nosocomial pneumonia. Little is known about the intrapulmonary pharmacokinetics (PK) of meropenem when administered by continuous infusion (CI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the PK of two dosages of meropenem (3 g vs 6 g/day by CI) in the plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) in critically ill patients with nosocomial pneumonia. METHODS: Thirty-one patients (81% male, median (IQR) age 72 (22) years) were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Sixteen patients received 1 g/8 h and 15 2 g/8 h by CI (8 h infusion). Plasma and ELF meropenem concentrations were modeled using a population methodology, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate the probability of attaining (PTA) a free ELF concentration of 50% of time above MIC (50% fT>MIC), which results in logarithmic killing and the suppression of resistance in experimental models of pneumonia. RESULTS: The median (IQR) of meropenem AUC(0–24 h) in the plasma and ELF was 287.6 (190.2) and 84.1 (78.8) mg h/L in the 1 g/8 h group vs 448.1 (231.8) and 163.0 (201.8) mg h/L in the 2 g/8 h group, respectively. The penetration ratio was approximately 30% and was comparable between the dosage groups. In the Monte Carlo simulations, only the highest approved dose of meropenem of 2 g/8 h by CI allowed to achieve an optimal PTA for all isolates with a MIC < 4 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the dose of meropenem administered by CI achieved a higher exposure in the plasma and ELF. The use of the highest licensed dose of 6 g/day may be necessary to achieve an optimal coverage in ELF for all susceptible isolates (MIC ≤ 2 mg/L) in patients with conserved renal function. An alternative therapy should be considered when the presence of microorganisms with a MIC greater than 2 mg/L is suspected.

4665,Single-Virus Tracking: From Imaging Methodologies to Virological Applications,2020-01-17,"BACKGROUND: Obesity occurs when the body’s energy intake is constantly greater than its energy consumption and the pharmacological enhancing the activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and (or) browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) has been considered promising strategies to treat obesity. METHODS: In this study, we took a multi-pronged approach to screen UCP1 activators, including in silico predictions, in vitro assays, as well as in vivo experiments. RESULTS: Base on Connectivity MAP (CMAP) screening, we obtained multiple drugs that possess a remarkably correlating gene expression pattern to that of enhancing activity in BAT and (or) sWAT signature. Particularly, we focused on a previously unreported drug-indirubin, a compound obtained from the Indigo plant, which is now mainly used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In the current study, our results shown that indirubin could enhance the BAT activity, as evidenced by up-regulated Ucp1 expression and enhanced mitochondrial respiratory function in vitro cellular model. Furthermore, indirubin treatment restrained high-fat diet (HFD)-induced body weight gain, improved glucose homeostasis and ameliorated hepatic steatosis which were associated with the increase of energy expenditure in the mice model. Moreover, we revealed that indirubin treatment increased BAT activity by promoting thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in BAT and induced browning of subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue (sWAT) of mice under HFD. Besides, our results indicated that indirubin induced UCP1 expression in brown adipocytes, at least in part, via activation of PKA and p38MAPK signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly show that as an effective BAT (as well as beige cells) activator, indirubin may have a protective effect on the prevention and treatment of obesity and its complications.","Wei, Gang; Sun, Honglin; Liu, Jun-li; Dong, Kai; Liu, Junli; Zhang, Min",Nutr Metab (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7076951/,21

A regular and structured platform was developed for use between participants from state level public health authorities, the military and the RKI. During the first three quarters, 46 infectious diseases were covered, including mandatory reports of measles and meningococcal meningitis and outbreaks of cowpox, which does not have to be notified in Germany. Results of a targeted evaluation and a consistently high attendance rate both indicate that the teleconference has met additional needs for supplemental information exchange among participants.

Five of the b-MAbs were specific for the peplomer (E2), five reacted to the nucleocapsid (N), and one reacted to the E1 protein of the Miller strain of TGEV. Protein A-Sepharose purification of MAbs yielded protein concentrations ranging from 0.40 to 3 mg per ml of ascites. Separate pools of N-MAbs and E2-MAbs, and the E1-MAb were used to monitor synthesis of TGE viral antigen in ST cells from 0 to 16 h post-infection at various multiplicities of infection (MOI). Epitopes of N proteins appeared sooner and at a lower MOI than those for the E1 and E2 proteins. The fixed-cell ELISA was also used to examine relative binding affinities of TGEV MAbs. Concentrations of b-MAbs producing a half-maximal signal ranged from 0.11 to 3.8 µg/ml for E2-MAbs, from 0.05 to 0.82 µg/ml for N-MAbs, and 6 µg/ml for the E1-MAb. The assay was used to determine the 50% neutralization concentrations for four neutralizing E2-MAbs (0.1 µg/ml to 6.9 µg/ml) and one E1-MAb (1.2 µg/ml). Competition assays between b-MAbs and unlabeled competitors indicated that at least two major antigenic sites exist on the E2-protein and 2 to 3 antigenic sites are present on the N-protein of Miller TGEV.","Simkins, R.

4882,Glial proteins in canine distemper virus-induced demyelination: A sequential immunocytochemical study,1983,"Cell-to-cell movement is a crucial step in plant virus infection. In many viruses, the movement function is secured by specific virus-encoded proteins. Amino acid sequence comparisons of these proteins revealed a vast superfamily containing a conserved sequence motif that may comprise a hydrophobic interaction domain. This superfamily combines proteins of viruses belonging to all principal groups of positive-strand RNA viruses, as well as single-stranded DNA containing geminiviruses, double-stranded DNA-containing pararetroviruses (caulimoviruses and badnaviruses), and tospoviruses that have negative-strand RNA genomes with two ambisense segments. In several groups of positive-strand RNA viruses, the movement function is provided by the proteins encoded by the so-called triple gene block including two putative small membrane-associated proteins and a putative RNA helicase. A distinct type of movement proteins with very high content of proline is found in tymoviruses. It is concluded that classification of movement proteins based on comparison of their amino acid sequences does not correlate with the type of genome nucleic acid or with grouping of viruses based on phylogenetic analysis of replicative proteins or with the virus host range. Recombination between unrelated or distantly related viruses could have played a major role in the evolution of the movement function. Limited sequence similarities were observed between i) movement proteins of dianthoviruses and the MIP family of cellular integral membrane proteins, and ii) between movement proteins of bromoviruses and cucumoviruses and M1 protein of influenza viruses which is involved in nuclear export of viral ribonucleoproteins. It is hypothesized that all movement proteins of plant viruses may mediate hydrophobic interactions between viral and cellular macromolecules.","Mushegian, A. R.; Koonin, E.

Following their localization at different sites of the digestive tract, they are defining the type of disease. Ileo-colonoscopy is an important step of the initial characterization of the lesions, completed with biopsies helful for the differential diagnosis between CD and ulcerative colitis or infectious colitis An endoscopy is only repeated in front of a new clinical problem or when a change of treatment is required. In case of severe colitis, colonoscopy may detect septic lesions as well as deep ulcers indicating severe evolution with a bad prognosis. After surgery, in most of the cases ileocolonoscopy detects recurrent lesions whose severity is linked to an unfavourable clinical evolution and permits therapeutic adaptation. Since the risk of colorectal cancer in CD predominant in the colon is probaly underestimated, a systematic colonoscopy after 8 to 10 years of evolution should be performed for the screening of malignant lesions. Colonoscopy is also useful for the treatment of complications of CD, i. e. dilatation of benign strictures, as well as localization and treatment of distal bleeding.

However, current antiviral strategies cannot provide highly effective protection. In this study, three theoretically effective interference target sites (71–91, 144–164, 218–238) targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PRRSV were designed and selected, and then three siRNA-expressing plasmids were constructed, respectively named p2.1-N71, p2.1-N144, and p2.1-N218. The recombinant siRNA-expressing plasmids were transfected into Marc-145 cells; then the cells were infected with PRRSV (JL07SW strain); finally, after incubation for 48 h, the antiviral activity of those siRNA-expressing plasmids in Marc-145 cells was assessed by cytopathic effects, virus titers, indirect immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time PCR. Experimental results demonstrated that these three siRNA-expressing plasmids could effectively and significantly inhibit the replication of PRRSV by 93.2%, 83.6%, and 89.2% in Marc-145 cells, respectively. Among these three siRNA-expressing plasmids, p2.1-N71 was found to be most effective, while p2.1-N144 and p2.1-N218 displayed relatively weak inhibition of virus replication. The results indicated that siRNA-expressing plasmids targeting the N gene of PRRSV could significantly inhibit PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells. Based on our experimental results and previous reports, the 71–91, 179–197, and 234–252 sites of the N gene are good choices to effectively inhibit the replication of PRRSV, and this RNA interference technique can be a potential anti-PRRSV strategy.","Yang, Minnan; Xiang, Qun; Zhang, Xiaodong; Li, Xiang; Sylla, Seydou; Ding, Zhuang",J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090845/,21

It currently lacks integrated crisis management and response programs to understand the importance of decision-making during and in the aftermath of a bioterrorist attack on the food supply. Computer simulations have been used successfully in other industries as training and analysis tools. This paper describes an agent-based simulation for food defense training and analysis. Production information, consumption patterns, morbidity/mortality rates, recall costs and additional information were collected and provided to a data-driven simulation to anticipate the impact of decision-making on economic and public health during a terrorist attack. A case study is given with a representative exercise involving forty industry representatives who participated in a food defense simulation. Their decisions (recall and microbiological and toxicological testing) were derived from testing results, press releases, epidemiological data, and discussions with other industry and regulatory teams. Decisions made during the simulation resulted in over 76,000 illnesses, 45 deaths, and $132 million in recall costs. The no intervention, baseline scenario estimated to result in 91,000 illnesses and 54 deaths, indicating the improved public health outcomes resulting from players’ decisions. Participants identified three key learning points: 1) communication between all groups is pertinent and challenging, 2) approaches to solve inherent food safety problems cannot be used to address food defense situations, and 3) human resource procedures regarding new hires and disgruntled employees should involve additional security measures. This computer simulation could be a valuable resource in food defense awareness and help educate companies and regulators about food defense risks and decision-making consequences.","Chaturvedi, Alok; Armstrong, Brian; Chaturvedi, Rashmi",Health Technol (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091043/,21

Infection with Puumala, the prevalent virus type in Germany, results in a more moderate form of HFRS, nephropathia epidemica. Infections with virus species on the American continents lead to a clinical picture with predominantly pulmonary pathology (hantaviral pulmonary syndrome). No specific antiviral therapy or approved vaccines are available for any hantavirus species.

7110,Single-particle fusion of influenza viruses reveals complex interactions with target membranes,2018-05-23,"Systems with interfaces are abundant in both technological applications and biology. While a fluid interface separates two fluids, membranes separate the inside of vesicles from the outside, the interior of biological cells from the environment, and compartmentalize cells into organelles. The physical properties of interfaces are characterized by interface tension, those of membranes are characterized by bending and stretching elasticity. Amphiphilic molecules like surfactants that are added to a system with two immiscible fluids decrease the interface tension and induce a bending rigidity. Lipid bilayer membranes of vesicles can be stretched or compressed by osmotic pressure; in biological cells, also the presence of a cytoskeleton can induce membrane tension. If the thickness of the interface or the membrane is small compared with its lateral extension, both can be described using two-dimensional mathematical surfaces embedded in three-dimensional space. We review recent work on the interaction of particles with interfaces and membranes. This can be micrometer-sized particles at interfaces that stabilise emulsions or form colloidosomes, as well as typically nanometer-sized particles at membranes, such as viruses, parasites, and engineered drug delivery systems. In both cases, we first discuss the interaction of single particles with interfaces and membranes, e.g. particles in external fields, non-spherical particles, and particles at curved interfaces, followed by interface-mediated interaction between two particles, many-particle interactions, interface and membrane curvature-induced phenomena, and applications.","Dasgupta, S; Auth, T; Gompper, G",J Phys Condens Matter,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104866/,21

There are three norovirus genogroups infecting humans. These genogroups are divided based on the sequence of their major capsid protein, which is able to form virus-like particles (VLPs) when expressed recombinantly. VLPs of the prototypical GI.1 Norwalk virus are known to disassemble into specific capsid protein oligomers upon alkaline treatment. Here, native mass spectrometry and electron microscopy on variants of GI.1 and of GII.17 were performed, revealing differences in terms of stability between these groups. Beyond that, these experiments indicate differences even between variants within a genotype. The capsid stability was monitored in different ammonium acetate solutions varying both in ionic strength and pH. The investigated GI.1 West Chester isolate showed comparable disassembly profiles to the previously studied GI.1 Norwalk virus isolate. However, differences were observed with the West Chester being more sensitive to alkaline pH. In stark contrast to that, capsids of the variant belonging to the currently prevalent genogroup GII were stable in all tested conditions.

7278,Diversity in the sialic acids,1992-02-11,"Mesostigmatid mites are blood-sucking parasitic mites found in wild rodent populations. Periodically they can also become a problem for laboratory rodent colonies, particularly when building construction or renovations disturb colonies of commensal (building) rodents that had been acting as hosts. Mesostigmatid mites infest both rats and mice and, unlike the more common rodent fur mites (Myobia, Myocoptes, and Radfordia sp.), can survive for long periods in the environment and travel considerable distances in search of new hosts. They easily penetrate barrier caging systems, including individually ventilated cages, thus circumventing the usual precautions to protect rodents from infection. The two mites reported in laboratory rodent colonies, Ornithonyssus bacoti and Laelaps echidnina, also bite humans and have the potential to transmit zoonotic diseases. Once the mites gain access to a colony, eradication requires elimination of commensal rodent reservoirs in addition to insecticide treatment of both the laboratory rodents and the environment. In view of the undesirability of insecticide use in the animal facility, it is advisable to investigate the effectiveness of preventive treatments, such as environmental application of insect growth regulators or silica-based products. This article summarizes available information on mesostigmatid mites and their laboratory incursions, and provides suggestions for diagnosis, treatment, and control based on the author’s experience with several outbreaks at a large academic institution.","Watson, Julie",ILAR J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108606/,21

The influenza virus genome is an 8-segment single-stranded RNA with high potential for in situ recombination. Two segments code for the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) antigens used for host-cell entry. At present, 16 H and 9 N subtypes are known, for a total of 144 possible different influenza subtypes, each with potentially different host susceptibility. With >10,000 species of birds found in nearly every terrestrial and aquatic habitat, there are few places on earth where birds cannot be found. The avian immune system differs from that of humans in several important features, including asynchronous B and T lymphocyte systems and a polymorphic multigene immune complex, but little is known about the immunogenetics of pathogenic response. Postbreeding dispersal and migration and a naturally high degree of environmental vagility mean that wild birds have the potential to be vectors that transmit highly pathogenic variants great distances from the original sources of infection.","Causey, Douglas; Edwards, Scott V.",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110149/,21

Since the discovery of type I IFNs in 1957, long double-stranded RNA formed during replication of many viruses was thought to be responsible for type I IFN induction, and for decades double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) was thought to be the receptor. Recently, this picture has dramatically changed. It now became evident that not PKR but two members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, TLR7 and TLR9, and two cytosolic helicases, RIG-I and MDA-5, are responsible for the majority of type I IFNs induced upon recognition of viral nucleic acids. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms by which those innate immune receptors detect viral infection. Based on the recent progress in the field, we now know that TLR7, TLR9, and RIG-I do not require long double-stranded RNA for type I IFN induction.","Schlee, M.; Barchet, W.; Hornung, V.; Hartmann, G.",Interferon: The 50th Anniversary,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120510/,21

Classically, a number of drugs based on GPCRs have been developed for such different indications as cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and oncologic diseases. Owing to the restricted structural information on GPCRs, only limited exploration of structure-based drug design has been possible. Much effort has been dedicated to structural biology on GPCRs and very recently an X-ray structure of the β2-adrenergic receptor was obtained. This breakthrough will certainly increase the efforts in structural biology on GPCRs and furthermore speed up and facilitate the drug discovery process.","Lundstrom, Kenneth",G Protein-Coupled Receptors in Drug Discovery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122359/,21
7931,Display of Peptides on the Surface of Tobacco Mosaic Virus Particles,2009,"The Arenaviridae family contains 22 recognized virus species, each of them strongly associated with a rodent species (except Tacaribe virus which is associated with a species of bat), suggesting an ancient co-evolutionary process. Although the concept of co-evolution between rodents and arenaviruses is now largely accepted, little has been uncovered in terms of dating the phenomenon and the mechanisms of evolution, including speciation and pathogenicity. These questions are targeted in the present chapter. Old World arenaviruses are associated with the Eurasian rodents in the family Muridae. New World arenaviruses are associated with American rodents in the subfamily Sigmodontinae. The correlation between the rodent host phylogeny and the viruses suggests a long association and a co-evolutionary process. Furthermore, three distinct New World arenaviruses share a common ancestor, demonstrating a unique recombination event that probably occurred in that ancestor. This shows that recombination among arenaviruses of different lineages might occur in nature. Recombination and co-evolutionary adaptation appear as the main mechanisms of arenavirus evolution, generating a high degree of diversity. The diversity among rodent host reservoir and virus species and the potential to exchange genomic material provide a basis for the emergence of new viruses and the risk of these becoming pathogenic for humans.","Gonzalez, J.

The rate-limiting step in this process is the activity of the heterotrimeric apical membrane epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Pharmacologic inhibitors and genetic manipulations that disrupt Na+ transport result in fluid accumulation within the lung and failure of gas exchange. The importance of Na(+) transport in the lung is also demonstrated in conditions such as ARDS, where abnormal absorption of Na(+) contributes to the pathophysiology of pulmonary disease. ENaC expression and function is influenced by diverse factors, such as oxygen tension, glucocorticoids, and cytoskeletal proteins. In addition, ENaC dysfunction has been shown to be induced by purinergic nucleotide activation of P2Y receptors (in paramyxoviral bronchiolitis) and reactive species (in acute lung injury). Finally, βadrenergic agonists have been shown experimentally to reverse defects in ENaC function, and improve hypoxemia and pulmonary edema, and may provide a novel therapeutic modality for ARDS, although some viral lung pathogens appear to induce insensitivity to their actions.","Davis, Ian C.; Matalon, Sadis",Hypoxia and the Circulation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122934/,21

Three groups of calves (n = 5 per group) were fed 1% pooled colostrum supplements (birth to 7 days of age) from BRV seropositive cows vaccinated with recombinant SA11(P[2]G3) rotavirus-like particles (VLPs), recombinant SA11 rotavirus core-like particles (CLPs), or inactivated SA11 rotavirus (SA11). Control calves (n = 5 per group) received either pooled colostrum from unvaccinated (BRV field exposure seropositive) control cows, or no colostrum. IgG1 antibody titers to IND BRV for the pooled colostrum were: 1048576 (VLP); 1048576 (CLP); 262144 (SA11); and 16384 (control colostrum). Elevated titers of BRV neutralizing (VN) antibodies were present in VLP colostrum (98 000), and SA11 colostrum (25 000), but not in CLP colostrum (1400), compared to colostrum from nonvaccinates (2081). Calves were orally inoculated with virulent IND BRV at 2 days of age and challenged at post-inoculation day (PID) 21. Calves were monitored daily for diarrhea and faecal BRV shedding through PID 10 and post-challenge day (PCD) 10. After colostrum feeding, the IgG1 antibody titers were highest in serum and faeces of calves fed VLP and CLP colostrum, but VN and IgA antibodies were highest in calves fed VLP colostrum. After BRV inoculation, calves fed colostrum from vaccinated cows had significantly fewer days of BRV-associated diarrhea and BRV shedding than control calves. All calves fed VLP colostrum were protected from diarrhea after BRV inoculation; two calves shed BRV. In the CLP colostrum group, one calf developed BRV-associated diarrhea and all calves shed virus. In the SA11 colostrum group, three calves developed BRV-associated diarrhea and four calves shed virus. BRV-associated diarrhea and shedding occurred in 9 of 10 control calves. Active IgM antibody responses occurred in faeces and/or serum of most calves after BRV inoculation. However, the highest active antibody responses (IgM and IgG1 in serum, and IgM, IgG1 or IgA in faeces) after BRV inoculation were in calves fed control or no colostrum, in association with clinical diarrhea in most of these calves. After challenge at PID 21, BRV-associated diarrhea and shedding were of short duration or absent, in all groups. These results demonstrate the efficacy of colostrum from VLP vaccinated cows to provide heterologous, passive protection against BRV diarrhea and shedding in calves. In comparison, calves fed CLP or SA11 colostrum were only partially protected against BRV diarrhea or shedding.","Fernandez, F.M.; Conner, M.E.; Hodgins, D.C.; Parwani, A.V.; Nielsen, P.R.; Crawford, S.E.; Estes, M.K.; Saif, L.J.",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131086/,21

It would take volumes to adequately discuss respiratory infections in all their complexity, and by the time any manuscript gets into print, it is likely to be outdated because of the rapid advances in the area of virology and antimicrobial agents. This review in no way claims completeness for any one subject, but an attempt has been made to bring into focus and with some sort of organization the vast amount of information in the literature, recent and old, relative to acute respiratory infections.

He recovered considerably within a year and was able to resume work. In 1975 his condition deteriorated again; it improved during the following few years, but a further deterioration then occurred. In March, 1981, the complement-fixing antibody titre to mumps virus was 1/32 in the serum and 1/4 in the CSF. In November, 1981, the CSF IgG index was increased and the altered serum/CSF antibody ratio persisted. The specificity of the altered antibody ratio was confirmed by the single radial haemolysis test and an immunoassay specific for mumps virus. Antibodies against the mumps virus envelope glycoprotein, M-protein, and nucleoprotein could be demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and the antibody patterns in serum and CSF were similar. Antibodies against other microorganisms were not detected in the patient's CSF, and mumps antibodies were not found in the CSF specimens of 57 control patients.

9567,The membrane structure of lipid-containing viruses,1974-04-08,"Tuna pyloric caeca aminopeptidase (tAP) is a glycosylated zinc-metalloenzyme containing apparently two identical subunits. The enzyme is reversibly inhibited in a time-dependent manner by amastatin. Slow development of tAP inhibition by this inhibitor could be demonstrated. Dissociation of the complex of tAP with amastatin is also slow. Two molar equivalents of the inhibitor are bound by the enzyme suggesting the presence of one catalytic site in each subunit. Chemical modification of tAP with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbonyl-metho-p-toluene sulfonate and N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinone revealed the presence of essential acidic amino acid residues probably located at the active site. Compatible with the presence of arginine and tyrosine residues at the catalytic site of most metalloproteinases, tAP is reversibly inhibited by phenylglyoxal and inactivated by tetranitromethane in a time-dependent fashion. The rate of inhibition by these modifiers could be significantly decreased if the enzyme was previously treated with amastatin suggesting that the modified amino acid residues are located at the catalytic site. Diethylpyrocarbonate did not affect the activity of both native and zinc-depleted tAP suggesting that histidine is not involved in the zinc-ligand formation.","Hajjou, Mustapha; Le Gal, Yves",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148818/,21

9586,HijAkt: The PI3K/Akt Pathway in Virus Replication and Pathogenesis,2012-02-13,"Infectious agents have intimately co-evolved with the host immune system, acquiring a portfolio of highly sophisticated mechanisms to modulate immunity. Among the common strategies developed by viruses, bacteria, protozoa, helminths, and fungi is the manipulation of the regulatory T cell network in order to favor pathogen survival and transmission. Treg activity also benefits the host in many circumstances by controlling immunopathogenic reactions to infection. Interestingly, some pathogens are able to directly induce the conversion of naive T cells into suppressive Foxp3-expressing Tregs, while others activate pre-existing natural Tregs, in both cases repressing pathogen-specific effector responses. However, Tregs can also act to promote immunity in certain settings, such as in initial stages of infection when effector cells must access the site of infection, and subsequently in ensuring generation of effector memory. Notably, there is little current information on whether infections selectively drive pathogen-specific Tregs, and if so whether these cells are also reactive to self-antigens. Further analysis of specificity, together with a clearer picture of the relative dynamics of Treg subsets over the course of disease, should lead to rational strategies for immune intervention to optimize immunity and eliminate infection.","Maizels, Rick M.; Smith, Katherine A.",Adv Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150045/,21

In the past three centuries, LAV have saved hundreds of millions of lives, and will continue to do so for many decades to come. Interestingly, the most successful LAVs, such as the smallpox vaccine, the measles vaccine, and the yellow fever vaccine, have been isolated and/or developed in a purely empirical manner without any understanding of the immunological mechanisms they trigger. Today, the mechanisms governing potent LAV immunogenicity and long-term induced protective immunity continue to be elusive, and therefore hamper the rational design of innovative vaccine strategies. A serious roadblock to understanding LAV-induced immunity has been the lack of suitable and cost-effective animal models that can accurately mimic human immune responses. In the last two decades, human-immune system mice (HIS mice), i.e., mice engrafted with components of the human immune system, have been instrumental in investigating the life-cycle and immune responses to multiple human-tropic pathogens. However, their use in LAV research has remained limited.

Most representatives of this group, also known as diazotrophic, are generally associated with soil rhizosphere of many plants and also establishing a more specific association living inside roots, leaves, and others plants tissues as endophyte. Their roles as plant growth‐promoting microorganisms are generally related to increase in plant biomass, phosphate and other mineral solubilization, and plant pathogen control.

After intestinal passage, inoculum‐derived oocysts extracted from goose faeces established severe infection in 14 neonatal BALB/c mice (inoculum dose 2.5 × 10(5)/mouse). The inoculum‐derived oocysts were detected in goose faeces up to 9 days post‐inoculation (PI); the number of intact oocysts and oocyst shells shed during the first 3 days PI was significantly higher than for the remaining 6 days PI (P<0.01). Based on acid‐fast stained air‐dried direct wet smears, 62% of the oocysts in goose faeces were intact (oocyst shells constituted 38%) and conformed to morphological features of viable and infectious inoculum oocysts. The fluorescence scores of the inoculated oocysts, obtained by use of the MERIFLUOR test, were identical to those obtained for the faeces‐recovered oocysts (majority 3 + to 4 +). The dynamics of oocyst shedding showed that overall, the birds released a significantly higher number of intact oocysts than oocyst shells (P<0.01) Retention of the viability and infectivity of C. parvum oocysts following intestinal passage through a migratory water‐fowl species has serious epidemiological implications. Water‐fowl can serve as mechanical vectors for the water‐borne oocysts and can contaminate surface waters with C. parvum. As the concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts in source waters is attributable to water‐shed management practices, water‐shed protection programme officials should consider water‐fowl as a potential factor enhancing contamination of the source water with Cryptosporidium.","Graczyk, Thaddeus K.; Cranfield, Michael R.; Fayer, Ronald; Trout, James; Goodale, Holly J.",Trop Med Int Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169778/,21

In addition to a series of typical risk factors for atherosclerosis, like hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking and obesity, emerging evidence suggests that atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, suggesting that chronic infection plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the most characteristic members of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which play an important role in innate immune mechanism. TLRs play different roles in different stages of infection of atherosclerosis-related pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae), periodontal pathogens including Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Overall, activation of TLR2 and 4 seems to have a profound impact on infection-related atherosclerosis.

However, the drug-resistant strains of pathogens continuously emerge, and medical treatments are often ineffective. Moreover, there is increasing public objections to drug residues in poultry products. The other important type of control is the vaccination which depends on immunity. This immunological control is the major practical alternative to chemotherapy. Success of vaccines in combating poultry diseases depends mainly on the choice of the proper type of vaccines, correct time of its usage, and method of administration. The types of vaccines include attenuated live vaccines, and these vaccines were shown to be effective in inducing protection. The second type is killed vaccine or whole bacteria extracts which is less successful in providing protection compared to live vaccines. The metabolic product vaccine (toxoids) is the third type of vaccine. The recombinant DNA technique was adopted to produce the protective antigens in a sufficient amount and in cost-effective ways. CONCLUSIONS: Protection studies against bacterial diseases were performed by using several trials: living vaccines (live attenuated vaccines; live, non-pathogenic microorganisms; live, low virulence microorganism), inactivated (killed) vaccines (heat-inactivated, chemical inactivates, radiation), metabolic product vaccines (toxoids), subunit vaccines (whole cell proteins, outer membrane proteins, purified flagellar proteins (flagellin), fimbrial proteins, pilus proteins, lipopolysaccharides), vaccines produced by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology, and DNA vaccines.","Rabie, Nagwa S.; Amin Girh, Zeinab M.

11280,Antiviral Activities of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. Tea Extract Against Human Influenza A Virus Rely Largely on Acidic pH but Partially on a Low-pH-Independent Mechanism,2019-10-16,"The time constant of the cerebral arterial bed (“tau”) estimates how fast the blood entering the brain fills the arterial vascular sector. Analogous to an electrical resistor–capacitor circuit, it is expressed as the product of arterial compliance (Ca) and cerebrovascular resistance (CVR). Hypocapnia increases the time constant in healthy volunteers and decreases arterial compliance in head trauma. How the combination of hyocapnia and trauma affects this parameter has yet to be studied. We hypothesized that in TBI patients the intense vasoconstrictive action of hypocapnia would dominate over the decrease in compliance seen after hyperventilation. The predominant vasoconstrictive response would maintain an incoming blood volume in the arterial circulation, thereby lengthening tau. We retrospectively analyzed recordings of intracranial pressure (ICP), arterial blood pressure (ABP), and blood flow velocity (FV) obtained from a cohort of 27 severe TBI patients [(39/30 years (median/IQR), 5 women; admission GCS 6/5 (median/IQR)] studied during a standard clinical CO(2) reactivity test. The reactivity test was performed by means of a 50-min increase in ventilation (20% increase in respiratory minute volume). CVR and Ca were estimated from these recordings, and their product calculated to find the time constant. CVR significantly increased [median CVR pre-hypocapnia/during hypocapnia: 1.05/1.35 mmHg/(cm(3)/s)]. Ca decreased (median Ca pre-hypocapnia/during hypocapnia: 0.130/0.124 arbitrary units) to statistical significance (p = 0.005). The product of these two parameters resulted in a significant prolongation of the time constant (median tau pre-hypocapnia/during hypocapnia: 0.136 s/0.152 s, p ˂ .001). Overall, the increase in CVR dominated over the decrease in compliance, hence tau was longer. We demonstrate a significant increase in the time constant of the cerebral circulation during hypocapnia after severe TBI, and attribute this to an increase in cerebrovascular resistance which outweighs the decrease in cerebral arterial bed compliance.","Puppo, Corina; Kasprowicz, Magdalena; Steiner, Luzius A.; Yelicich, Bernardo; Lalou, Despina Afrodite; Smielewski, Peter; Czosnyka, Marek",J Clin Monit Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223592/,21
11606,"Broad Antiviral Activity of Ginkgolic Acid against Chikungunya, Mayaro, Una, and Zika Viruses",2020-04-15,"Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is the key transcription factor for the induction of IFN and antiviral genes. The absence of antiviral genes in IRF3 deficiency leads to susceptibility to a wide range of viral infections. Previously, we uncovered a function for nontranscriptional IRF3 (nt-IRF3), RLR (RIG-I-like receptor)-induced IRF3-mediated pathway of apoptosis (RIPA), which triggers apoptotic killing of virus-infected cells. Using knock-in mice expressing a transcriptionally inactive, but RIPA-active, IRF3 mutant, we demonstrated the relative contribution of RIPA to host antiviral defense. Given that RIPA is a cellular antiviral pathway, we hypothesized that small molecules that promote RIPA in virus-infected cells would act as antiviral agents. To test this, we conducted a high throughput screen of a library of FDA-approved drugs to identify novel RIPA activators. Our screen identified doxorubicin as a potent RIPA-activating agent. In support of our hypothesis, doxorubicin inhibited the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, a model rhabdovirus, and its antiviral activity depended on its ability to activate IRF3 in RIPA. Surprisingly, doxorubicin inhibited the transcriptional activity of IRF3. The antiviral activity of doxorubicin was expanded to flavivirus and herpesvirus that also activate IRF3. Mechanistically, doxorubicin promoted RIPA by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Finally, we validated these results using another RIPA-activating compound, pyrvinium pamoate, which showed a similar antiviral effect without affecting the transcriptional activity of IRF3. Therefore, we demonstrate that the RIPA branch of IRF3 can be targeted therapeutically to prevent virus infection.","Glanz, Anna; Chawla, Karan; Fabry, Stephanie; Subramanian, Gayatri; Garcia, Julie; Jay, Bryanna; Ciricillo, Jacob; Chakravarti, Ritu; Taylor, R.

11766,Targeting Intrinsically Disordered Proteins through Dynamic Interactions,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND: There is a concern that civilian gunshot injuries in Europe are increasing but there is a lack of contemporary studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the current epidemiology and outcome of firearm injuries. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of all patients (n = 235) treated for firearm injuries admitted to a Scandinavian trauma center between 2005 and 2016. Local and national trauma registries were used for data collection. RESULTS: Mean age was 31.3 years (SD ± 12.9; range 16–88 years); 93.6% males; mean ISS was 14.3 (SD ± 15.9); 31.9% (75/235) had ISS > 15. There was a significant increase in penetrating trauma (P < 0.001) and firearm injuries (P < 0.001) over the years. The most common anatomical location of firearm injury was the lower extremity, (n = 138/235; 38%), followed by the abdomen (n = 69;19%), upper extremity (n = 53;15%), chest (n = 50; 14%), and head and neck (n = 50; 14%). Ninety patients (38.3%) had more than one anatomic injury location. There were in total 360 firearm injuries and 168 major surgical procedures were performed. 53% (n = 125) of patients underwent at least one surgical procedure. The most common procedures were fracture surgery 42% (n = 70/168), followed by laparotomy 30%% (n = 51), chest tube 17% (n = 29), and thoracotomy 11% (n = 18). Forty-one patients (17%) had at least one major vascular injury (n = 54). The most common vascular injury was lower extremity vessel injuries, 26/54 (48%), followed by vessels in chest and abdomen. There was a significant increase in vascular injuries during the study period (P < 0.006). The 30-day mortality was 12.8% (n = 30); 24 patients died within 24 h mainly due to injuries to the chest and the head and neck region. CONCLUSIONS: Firearm injuries cause significant morbidity and mortality and are an important medical and public health problem. In a Scandinavian trauma center there has been an increase of firearm injuries in recent years. The lower extremities followed by the abdomen are the dominating injured regions and there has been an increase in associated vascular injuries.","Bäckman, Pernilla Brandt; Riddez, Louis; Adamsson, Lennart; Wahlgren, Carl-Magnus",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7278766/,21

The level-set segmentation method, combined with spatial and temporal information, was used to measure respiratory volume accurately. The shape of the human chest wall was used as spatial information. As temporal information, the segmentation result from the previous frame in the time-aligned depth image was used. The results of the proposed method were verified using a ventilator. The proposed method was also compared with other level-set methods. The result showed that the mean tidal volume error of the proposed method was 8.41% compared to the actual tidal volume. This was calculated to have less error than with two other methods: the level-set method with spatial information (14.34%) and the level-set method with temporal information (10.93%). The difference between these methods of tidal volume error was statistically significant [Formula: see text].

11999,Astrocytes influence medulloblastoma phenotypes and CD133 surface expression,2020-07-06,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by speech impairment, intellectual disability, ataxia, and epilepsy. AS is caused by mutations in the maternal copy of UBE3A located on chromosome 15q11-13. UBE3A codes for E6AP (E6 Associated Protein), a prominent member of the HECT (Homologous to E6AP C-Terminus) E3 ubiquitin ligase family. E6AP catalyzes the posttranslational attachment of ubiquitin via its HECT domain onto various intracellular target proteins to regulate DNA repair and cell cycle progression. The HECT domain consists of an N-lobe, required for E2~ubiquitin recruitment, while the C-lobe contains the conserved catalytic cysteine required for ubiquitin transfer. Previous genetic studies of AS patients have identified point mutations in UBE3A that result in amino acid substitutions or premature termination during translation. An AS transversion mutation (codon change from ATA to AAA) within the region of the gene that codes for the catalytic HECT domain of E6AP has been annotated (I827K), but the molecular basis for this loss of function substitution remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the I827K substitution destabilizes the 3D fold causing protein aggregation of the C-terminal lobe of E6AP using a combination of spectropolarimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Our fluorescent ubiquitin activity assays with E6AP-I827K show decreased ubiquitin thiolester formation and ubiquitin discharge. Using 3D models in combination with our biochemical and biophysical results, we rationalize why the I827K disrupts E6AP-dependent ubiquitylation. This work provides new insight into the E6AP mechanism and how its malfunction can be linked to the AS phenotype.","Beasley, Steven A.; Kellum, Chloe E.; Orlomoski, Rachel J.; Idrizi, Feston; Spratt, Donald E.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7343168/,21

In Vietnam, approximately 50% of farmers have lived in rural and mountainous areas. Yet, little has been known about how psychological distress impacts mountainous farmers’ health. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the prevalence and risk factors related to psychological distress among mountainous farmers in Vietnam. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional study was performed from August to September 2018 in Moc Chau district, Vietnam. A structured questionnaire and face-to-face interviews were used for data collection. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 197 farmers aged at least 18 years, spoke Vietnamese, was not suffering from severe diseases and residing in Moc Chau at the time of the survey were recruited. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) was employed to measure psychological distress. The tobit and logistic regressions were applied to indicate associated factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of psychological distress was 38.2% (95% CI 31.3% to 45.5%).

The automated utilization of this information is challenging due to the overwhelming quantity of posts and the distributed nature of the information related to subjects across several posts. Numerous approaches have been proposed to detect topics from collections of microposts, where the topics are represented by lists of terms such as words, phrases, or word embeddings. Such topics are used in tasks like classification and recommendations. The interpretation of topics is considered a separate task in such methods, albeit they are becoming increasingly human-interpretable. This work proposes an approach for identifying machine-interpretable topics of collective interest. We define topics as a set of related elements that are associated by having posted in the same contexts. To represent topics, we introduce an ontology specified according to the W3C recommended standards. The elements of the topics are identified via linking entities to resources published on Linked Open Data (LOD). Such representation enables processing topics to provide insights that go beyond what is explicitly expressed in the microposts. The feasibility of the proposed approach is examined by generating topics from more than one million tweets collected from Twitter during various events. The utility of these topics is demonstrated with a variety of topic-related tasks along with a comparison of the effort required to perform the same tasks with words-list-based representations. Manual evaluation of randomly selected 36 sets of topics yielded 81.0% and 93.3% for the precision and F1 scores respectively.","Yıldırım, Ahmet; Uskudarli, Suzan",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418982/,21
13049,Identification of protein-protected mRNA fragments and structured excised intron RNAs in human plasma by TGIRT-seq peak calling,2020-09-02,"The discrimination of non-focal class (NFC) and focal class (FC), is vital in localizing the epileptogenic zone (EZ) during neurosurgery. In the conventional diagnosis method, the neurologist has to visually examine the long hour electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which consumes time and is prone to error. Hence, in this present work, automated diagnosis of FC EEG signals from NFC EEG signals is developed using the Fast Walsh–Hadamard Transform (FWHT) method, entropies, and artificial neural network (ANN). The FWHT analyzes the EEG signals in the frequency domain and decomposes it into the Hadamard coefficients. Five different nonlinear features, namely approximate entropy (ApEn), log-energy entropy (LogEn), fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn), sample entropy (SampEn), and permutation entropy (PermEn) are extracted from the decomposed Hadamard coefficients. The extracted features detail the nonlinearity in the NFC and the FC EEG signals. The judicious entropy features are supplied to the ANN classifier, with a 10-fold cross-validation method to classify the NFC and FC classes. Two publicly available datasets such as the University of Bonn and Bern-Barcelona dataset are used to evaluate the proposed approach. A maximum sensitivity of 99.70%, the accuracy of 99.50%, and specificity of 99.30% with the 3750 pairs of NFC and FC signal are achieved using the Bern-Barcelona dataset, while the accuracy of 92.80%, the sensitivity of 91%, and specificity of 94.60% is achieved using University of Bonn dataset.

The frequency of potentially identifiable disclosures online during periods of active engagement is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to quantify potentially identifiable content shared on social media by physicians and other health care providers using the hashtag #ShareAStoryInOneTweet. METHODS: We accessed and searched Twitter’s API using Symplur software for tweets that included the hashtag #ShareAStoryInOneTweet. We identified 1206 tweets by doctors, nurses, and other health professionals out of 43,374 tweets shared in May 2018. Tweet content was evaluated in January 2019 to determine the incidence of instances where names or potentially identifiable information about patients were shared; content analysis of tweets in which information about others had been disclosed was performed. The study also evaluated whether participants raised concerns about privacy breaches and estimated the frequency of deleted tweets. The study used dual, blinded coding for a 10% sample to estimate intercoder reliability using Cohen κ statistic for identifying the potential identifiability of tweet content. RESULTS: Health care professionals (n=656) disclosing information about others included 486 doctors (74.1%) and 98 nurses (14.9%). Health care professionals sharing stories about patient care disclosed the time frame in 95 tweets (95/754, 12.6%) and included patient names in 15 tweets (15/754, 2.0%). It is estimated that friends or families could likely identify the clinical scenario described in 242 of the 754 tweets (32.1%). Among 348 tweets about potentially living patients, it was estimated that 162 (46.6%) were likely identifiable by patients. Intercoder reliability in rating the potential identifiability demonstrated 86.8% agreement, with a Cohen κ of 0.8 suggesting substantial agreement. We also identified 78 out of 754 tweets (6.5%) that had been deleted on the website but were still viewable in the analytics software data set. CONCLUSIONS: During periods of active sharing online, nurses, physicians, and other health professionals may sometimes share more information than patients or families might expect. More study is needed to determine whether similar events arise frequently and to understand how to best ensure that patients’ rights are adequately respected.","Ahmed, Wasim; Jagsi, Reshma; Gutheil, Thomas G; Katz, Matthew S",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7492977/,21
13262,"The Husavirus Posa-Like Viruses in China, and a New Group of Picornavirales",2020-09-07,"Arthropod-borne viruses contribute significantly to global mortality and morbidity in humans and animals. These viruses are mainly transmitted between susceptible vertebrate hosts by hematophagous arthropod vectors, especially mosquitoes. Recently, there has been substantial attention for a novel group of viruses, referred to as insect-specific viruses (ISVs) which are exclusively maintained in mosquito populations. Recent discoveries of novel insect-specific viruses over the past years generated a great interest not only in their potential use as vaccine and diagnostic platforms but also as novel biological control agents due to their ability to modulate arbovirus transmission. While arboviruses infect both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, the replication of insect-specific viruses is restricted in vertebrates at multiple stages of virus replication. The vertebrate restriction factors include the genetic elements of ISVs (structural and non-structural genes and the untranslated terminal regions), vertebrate host factors (agonists and antagonists), and the temperature-dependent microenvironment. A better understanding of these bottlenecks is thus warranted. In this review, we explore these factors and the complex interplay between ISVs and their hosts contributing to this host restriction phenomenon.","Elrefaey, Ahmed ME; Abdelnabi, Rana; Rosales Rosas, Ana Lucia; Wang, Lanjiao; Basu, Sanjay; Delang, Leen",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7552076/,21

In recent years, genotypes GI-7, GI-13, and GI-19 have been the most prevalent IBV strains in China. However, in this study, we found that most IBV strains from southern China in 2016–2017 belonged to genotype GVI-1. This genotype, for which there is no vaccine, has been reported sporadically in the region. The GDTS13 strain, which caused severe IB outbreaks on the farms where it was isolated, was evaluated as a candidate vaccine strain. GDTS13 was serially passaged in specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs for 100 generations to produce GDTS13-F100. Safety testing indicated that GDTS13-F100 had no pathogenic effect on chickens. Additionally, GDTS13-F100 showed an excellent protective effect against GDTS13, with no clinical signs or virus shedding observed in immunized chickens challenged with the parent strain.

Here, we investigated host suppression of 2-micron (2μ) plasmids, multicopy nuclear parasites that have co-evolved with budding yeasts. We developed SCAMPR (Single-Cell Assay for Measuring Plasmid Retention) to measure copy number heterogeneity and 2μ plasmid loss in live cells. We identified three S. cerevisiae strains that lack endogenous 2μ plasmids and reproducibly inhibit mitotic plasmid stability. Focusing on the Y9 ragi strain, we determined that plasmid restriction is heritable and dominant. Using bulk segregant analysis, we identified a high-confidence Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) with a single variant of MMS21 associated with increased 2μ instability. MMS21 encodes a SUMO E3 ligase and an essential component of the Smc5/6 complex, involved in sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair. Our analyses leverage natural variation to uncover a novel means by which budding yeasts can overcome highly successful genetic parasites.","Hays, Michelle; Young, Janet M; Levan, Paula F; Malik, Harmit S",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7652418/,21

We performed an anthropometric profile evaluation in a sample of youth goalkeepers (n = 42) during a training camp, dividing them into three categories based on their years from peak height velocity (YPHV). We also checked if the selection of goalkeepers was associated with the birth quartile. The results showed that most of the participants’ anthropometric parameters followed the normal trend according to the maturation stages. However, several subjects showed an overweight/obese condition and/or high waist circumference. Non-optimal values were found, mostly in the group of goalkeepers around the PHV. In addition, no selection based on birth quartile was seen. Therefore, the anthropometric profile and body composition of youth goalkeepers are physiologically affected by maturity status. However, several subjects were found to be overweight/obese and at cardiometabolic risk, suggesting that children and adolescents, although practicing sport, should pay attention to potentially contributing factors such as the attainment of the recommended levels of physical activity, lowering sedentary time, and adopt a healthy lifestyle.","Di Credico, Andrea; Gaggi, Giulia; Ghinassi, Barbara; Mascherini, Gabriele; Petri, Cristian; Giminiani, Riccardo Di; Di Baldassarre, Angela; Izzicupo, Pascal",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7664635/,21

Prolonged loneliness in young adulthood is a risk factor for concurrent and future mental health problems and attrition, making college a critical time for support. Cognitive and behavioral interventions show promise for decreasing loneliness and can be widely disseminated through technology. OBJECTIVE: This pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the initial efficacy, feasibility, and desirability of a smartphone app, Nod, designed to deliver cognitive and behavioral skill-building exercises to reduce loneliness during the transition to college. METHODS: First-year college students (N=221, mean age 18.7 years, 59% female) were recruited online during incoming student orientation, and randomized to either receive immediate access to Nod (experimental group, n=100) or access after 4 weeks (control group, n=121). The app delivered skills via fully automated (1) “social challenges,” suggested activities designed to build social connections; (2) reflections, brief cognitive reframing exercises; and (3) student testimonials that encouraged a growth mindset toward social connection building. Main intention-to-treat analyses were used to compare the conditions on self-assessed loneliness, depressive symptoms, and other mental health and college adjustment outcomes at week 4, controlling for baseline values on those variables. Analyses were also performed to test the hypothesis that the treatment benefits would be particularly pronounced for participants with heightened psychological vulnerability at baseline (ie, higher baseline depressive symptoms and loneliness). RESULTS: Retention was 97% at week 4, and participants viewed an average 36.7 pages of app content. There were no significant condition differences in loneliness at week 4 (F(1, 211)=0.05, P=.82; η(p)(2) <.001). However, there was a significant condition-by-baseline depression interaction to predict week-4 loneliness (F(1,209)=9.65, P=.002; η(p)(2) =.04). Simple slope analyses indicated that baseline depression positively predicted week-4 loneliness among control participants (r=0.30, t(209)=3.81, P<.001), but not among experimental participants (r=–0.09, t(209)=–0.84, P=.40), suggesting that Nod buffered participants with high baseline depression scores from experiencing heightened midquarter loneliness. Similarly, there were no significant condition differences in other week-4 outcomes. However, moderation by baseline vulnerability was found for week-4 depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and indices of college adjustment (eg, perceived social support and campus belonging). CONCLUSIONS: Although Nod exposure did not impact outcomes for the full sample, these results provide initial evidence of its benefit for vulnerable students. The results of this trial suggest that cognitive and behavioral skills delivered via a mobile app can buffer psychologically vulnerable college students against heightened loneliness and depressive symptoms, as well as other negative college adjustment outcomes. Future work will aim to improve upon app engagement, and to address loneliness among other key populations.

Acute native lung hyperinflation (ANLH) is a unique postoperative complication of single-lung transplantation for COPD patients, with incidence varying in the medical literature from 15 to 30%. The diagnosis is made radiographically by contralateral mediastinal shift and ipsilateral diaphragmatic flattening. ANLH can deteriorate into hemodynamic instability, and respiratory impairment can result from compression of the allograft, which can precipitate atelectasis, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia, necessitating specific ventilatory intervention or volume reduction surgery. Currently, there is consensus for a therapeutic role of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in acute respiratory failure after lung transplantation as a well-tolerated measure to avoid re-intubation. This manuscript presents a concise review on the diagnosis and treatment of ANLH following unilateral lung transplant, along with a management algorithm created by the authors.","Shehata, Islam M.; Elhassan, Amir; Urits, Ivan; Viswanath, Omar; Seoane, Leonardo; Shappley, Courtney; Kaye, Alan D.",Pulm Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7709809/,21

However, since many host-targeted drugs inadvertently hamper microbiome growth, repeated drug administration can lead to microbiome evolutionary adaptation. We tested if evolved bacterial resistance against host-targeted drugs alters their drug metabolism and impacts host treatment success. We used a model system of Caenorhabditis elegans, its bacterial diet, and two fluoropyrimidine chemotherapies. Genetic screens revealed that most of loss-of-function resistance mutations in Escherichia coli also reduced drug toxicity in the host. We found that resistance rapidly emerged in E. coli under natural selection and converged to a handful of resistance mechanisms. Surprisingly, we discovered that nutrient availability during bacterial evolution dictated the dietary effect on the host – only bacteria evolving in nutrient-poor media reduced host drug toxicity. Our work suggests that bacteria can rapidly adapt to host-targeted drugs and by doing so may also impact the host.","Rosener, Brittany; Sayin, Serkan; Oluoch, Peter O; García González, Aurian P; Mori, Hirotada; Walhout, Albertha JM; Mitchell, Amir",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7725501/,21

To date, there is not a practical, as well as an accurate sample for reflecting chronic glucose levels. We measured earwax glucose in 37 controls. Participants provided standard serum, glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and earwax samples at two time-points, one month apart. The specimens measured baseline fasting glucose, a follow-up postprandial glucose level and a between sample chronic glucose, calculated using the average level on the two occasions. The baseline earwax sample was obtained using a clinical method and the follow-up using a novel self-sampling earwax device. The earwax analytic time was significantly faster using the novel device, in comparison to the clinical use of the syringe. Earwax accurately reflected glucose at both assessments with stronger correlations than HbA(1c). Follow-up postprandial concentrations were more significant than their respective fasting baseline concentrations, reflecting differences in fasting and postprandial glycemia and more efficient standardization at follow up. Earwax demonstrated to be more predictable than HbA(1c) in reflecting systemic fasting, postprandial and long-term glucose levels, and to be less influenced by confounders. Earwax glucose measurements were approximately 60% more predictable than HbA(1c) in reflecting glycemia over a month. The self-sampling device provided a sample that might accurately reflect chronic glycemia.","Herane-Vives, Andrés; Espinoza, Susana; Sandoval, Rodrigo; Ortega, Lorena; Alameda, Luis; Young, Allan H.; Arnone, Danilo; Hayes, Alexander; Benöhr, Jan",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7764152/,21

14612,Apolipoprotein C-III and cardiovascular diseases: when genetics meet molecular pathologies,2021-01-03,"The principle of monoclonality with regard to bacterial infections was considered immutable prior to 30 years ago. This view, espoused by Koch for acute infections, has proven inadequate regarding chronic infections as persistence requires multiple forms of heterogeneity among the bacterial population. This understanding of bacterial plurality emerged from a synthesis of what-were-then novel technologies in molecular biology and imaging science. These technologies demonstrated that bacteria have complex life cycles, polymicrobial ecologies, and evolve in situ via the horizontal exchange of genic characters. Thus, there is an ongoing generation of diversity during infection that results in far more highly complex microbial communities than previously envisioned. This perspective is based on the fundamental tenet that the bacteria within an infecting population display genotypic diversity, including gene possession differences, which result from horizontal gene transfer mechanisms including transformation, conjugation, and transduction. This understanding is embodied in the concepts of the supragenome/pan-genome and the distributed genome hypothesis (DGH). These paradigms have fostered multiple researches in diverse areas of bacterial ecology including host–bacterial interactions covering the gamut of symbiotic relationships including mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. With regard to the human host, within each of these symbiotic relationships all bacterial species possess attributes that contribute to colonization and persistence; those species/strains that are pathogenic also encode traits for invasion and metastases. Herein we provide an update on our understanding of bacterial plurality and discuss potential applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccinology based on perspectives provided by the DGH with regard to the evolution of pathogenicity.","Hammond, Jocelyn A.; Gordon, Emma A.; Socarras, Kayla M.; Chang Mell, Joshua; Ehrlich, Garth D.",Biochem Soc Trans,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7752077/,21

This narrative review is designed to identify and propose solutions for the current problems in the process of offering residency interviews. We used PubMed and web browser searches to identify relevant studies and reports. Materials were assessed for relevance to the current process of distributing residency interviews. There is limited relevant literature and the quality is poor overall. We were able to identify several key problem areas including uncertain timing of interview offers; disruption caused by the timing of interview offers; imbalance of interview offers and available positions; and a lack of clarity around waitlist and rejection status. In addition, the couples match and need for coordination of interviews creates a special case. Many of the problems related to residency interview offers are amenable to program-level interventions, which may serve as best practices for residency programs, focusing on clear communication of processes as well as attention to factors such as offer-timing and numbers.

METHODS: Systemically healthy controls (C group, n = 62), T2DM patients not taking statins (D group, n = 57) and T2DM patients taking statins (S group, n = 24) were recruited. In each group, subjects (40–85 years) were subclassified into the h (periodontal health)group, the g (gingivitis)group or the p (periodontitis) group according to different periodontal conditions. 17 cytokines in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and saliva samples of each subject were measured utilizing the Luminex technology kit. Further, HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin), FPG (fasting plasma glucose), PD (probing depth), CAL (clinical attachment level), BOP (bleeding on probing), GI (gingival index) and PI (periodontal index) were recorded. Data distribution was tested through the Shapiro-Wilk test, upon which the Kruskal-Wallis test was applied followed by Mann-Whitney U test and Bonferroni’s correction. RESULTS: Levels of IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 in the saliva of the Dh group were significantly lower than those in the Ch group, while factor IL-4 was higher (p<0.05). Levels of MIP-3α, IL-7 and IL-2 in GCF of the Dh group were considerably higher than those in the Ch group (p<0.05), while that of IL-23 was considerably lower. Compared with the Cg group, levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13 were significantly lower in the saliva of the Dg group (p<0.05). Lower levels of IFN-γ, IL-5 and IL-10 were detected in the Sg group than those in the Cg group (p<0.05). At the same time, levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-7, IL-13, IL-17, IL-21 and MIP-3α in the gingival crevicular fluid of the Sg group were lower in comparison with the Dg group. In addition, lower levels of IL-4 and higher levels of IL-7 in GCF were identified in the Dg group than those in the Cg group, while in the Sg group, lower levels of IL-4, MIP-1αand MIP-3αwere observed than those in the Cg group (p<0.05). Lower levels of IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13 and I-TAC were found in the Sp group compared with those in the Cp group. The IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were lower in the Dp group than those in the Cp group (p<0.05). Meanwhile, in the Sp group, lower levels of pro-inflammatory factors IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-21 and TNF-α, in addition to higher levels of anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-5 in gingival crevicular fluid, were identified than those in the Dp group. Higher levels of IFN-γ,IL-1β,IL-2,IL-7,IL-21 and TNF-α and a lower level of IL-5 in the Dp group were identified than those in the Cp group (p<0.05). Moreover, statins were able to substantially reduce PD in T2DM patients with periodontitis, indicating an obvious influence on the levels of cytokines secreted by Th1 cells, Th2 cells and Th17 cells, as revealed by PCA (principal component analysis).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four topics were specifically discussed: deficiencies/uncertainties in IBs, guidance for the investigator, reference safety information, and potential risks for human subjects associated with inadequate non-clinical safety assessment in the IB. In each case, 43 participants took part in a real-time online survey with pre-defined questions to capture the audience’s opinion. RESULTS: The ‘Summary of Data and Guidance for the Investigator’ was considered as the section of the IB with the highest need for improvement with emphasis on readability, comprehensibility, timeliness of data, and appropriateness for risk assessment. It was suggested that the IB should at least be signed by the sponsor’s scientist responsible for the content on pharmacology and toxicology. It was agreed that sponsors should consider thoroughly whether changes to an IB constitute a substantial amendment, and that the IB should include a section on the change history. Non-clinical pharmacology studies with negative outcomes should be reported in the IB in order to avoid assessment bias. The reference safety information for expectedness assessment of suspected serious adverse reactions should be provided as a stand-alone section of the IB.

LBs disassemble into a lipid-protein network that reduces surface tension and facilitates gas exchange in the alveolar cavity. Current knowledge of LB architecture is predominantly based on electron microscopy studies using disruptive sample preparation methods.

Using deconvolution and 3D image registration, we were able to identify fluorescently labeled membrane structures analyzed by cryo-electron tomography. In situ cryo-electron tomography of A549 cells as well as primary Human Small Airway Epithelial Cells revealed that LBs are composed of membrane sheets frequently attached to the limiting membrane through “T”-junctions. We report a so far undescribed outer membrane dome protein complex (OMDP) on the limiting membrane of LBs.

In severe cases and if not rapidly eliminated from the plasma, this can lead to multiple organ failure and death. CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old Asian woman (original from Vietnam) was admitted after ecstasy intoxication resulting in multi-organ failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome, metabolic acidosis, capillary leakage syndrome, renal failure, shock refractory to standard resuscitation). As a consequence, continuous renal replacement therapy and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were started. Methylene blue administration to reverse vasoplegia was decided, but unfortunately, Patent Blue V was erroneously administered, resulting in a severe clinical picture of methemoglobinemia and tissue hypoxia. As a therapeutic intervention, CytoSorb hemoadsorption was initiated, and rapid and significant reduction in plasma methemoglobin, accompanied by improved hemodynamics and normalization in plasma lactate levels, was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case describing the application of CytoSorb hemoadsorption in a patient with ecstasy intoxication complicated by iatrogenic administration of Patent Blue V.

Centre for Intervention Science in Maternal and Child health), the antimicrobial resistant bacteria considered to be clinically most important for human health and earmarked for surveillance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant bacteria, methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B -resistant vancomycin-resistant (VRSA) Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). If these bacteria are carried in the female genital tract, they may be transmitted to the neonate causing local or systemic neonatal infections that can be difficult to treat with conventionally available antimicrobials. In order to develop effective treatment strategies, there is need for updated information about the prevalence of colonization with important antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the prevalence of vaginal colonization with potentially pathogenic and clinically important AMR bacteria among women in labour in Uganda and to identify factors associated with colonization. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among HIV-1 and HIV-2 negative women in labour at three primary health care facilities in Uganda. Drug susceptibility testing was done using the disk diffusion method on bacterial isolates cultured from vaginal swabs. We calculated the prevalence of colonization with potentially pathogenic and clinically important AMR bacteria, in addition to multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, defined as bacteria resistant to antibiotics from ≥ 3 antibiotic classes. RESULTS: We found that 57 of the 1472 enrolled women (3.9% prevalence; 95% Confidence interval [CI] 3.0%, 5.1%) were colonized with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceace, 27 (1.8%; 95% CI 1.2%, 2.6%) were colonized with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and 85 (5.8%; 95% CI 4.6%, 7.1%) were colonized with MRSA. The prevalence of colonization with MDR bacteria was high (750/1472; 50.9%; 95% CI 48.4%, 53.5%). Women who were ≥ 30 years of age had higher odds of being colonized with MDR bacteria compared to women aged 20–24 years (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1, 2.2). CONCLUSION: Most of the women included in our study were vaginally colonized with potentially pathogenic MDR and other clinically important AMR bacteria. The high prevalence of colonization with these bacteria is likely to further increase the incidence of difficult-to-treat neonatal sepsis.","Tumuhamye, Josephine; Steinsland, Hans; Bwanga, Freddie; Tumwine, James K.; Ndeezi, Grace; Mukunya, David; Namugga, Olive; Kasede, Agnes Napyo; Sommerfelt, Halvor; Nankabirwa, Victoria",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7887551/,21
15711,Temporal bias in case-control design: preventing reliable predictions of the future,2021-02-17,"BACKGROUND: How specific nutrients influence adaptive immunity is of broad interest. Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide and imparts a significant burden of global disease; however, its effects on immunity remain unclear. METHODS: We used a hepcidin mimetic and several genetic models to examine the effect of low iron availability on T cells in vitro and on immune responses to vaccines and viral infection in mice. We examined humoral immunity in human patients with raised hepcidin and low serum iron caused by mutant TMPRSS6. We tested the effect of iron supplementation on vaccination-induced humoral immunity in piglets, a natural model of iron deficiency. FINDINGS: We show that low serum iron (hypoferremia), caused by increased hepcidin, severely impairs effector and memory responses to immunizations. The intensified metabolism of activated lymphocytes requires the support of enhanced iron acquisition, which is facilitated by IRP1/2 and TFRC. Accordingly, providing extra iron improved the response to vaccination in hypoferremic mice and piglets, while conversely, hypoferremic humans with chronically increased hepcidin have reduced concentrations of antibodies specific for certain pathogens. Imposing hypoferremia blunted the T cell, B cell, and neutralizing antibody responses to influenza virus infection in mice, allowing the virus to persist and exacerbating lung inflammation and morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoferremia, a well-conserved physiological innate response to infection, can counteract the development of adaptive immunity. This nutrient trade-off is relevant for understanding and improving immune responses to infections and vaccines in the globally common contexts of iron deficiency and inflammatory disorders.

The aim of the current study was to examine the effects of two differently delivered interventions based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) on symptoms of burnout, depression, quality of life, psychological flexibility, and mindfulness skills. METHOD: A total of 110 parents of children aged 0.8 to 17 years with chronic conditions and developmental disabilities participated in a randomized controlled trial lasting 13 weeks with two intervention groups: (1) an iACT intervention, including three psychologist-led video conferencing sessions, and (2) a self-help ACT, which received self-help material: an ACT-based booklet with the possibility of using ACT-based online exercises. RESULTS: For the main outcome measure burnout, a similar decrease was found in both groups. The supported iACT intervention produced significantly larger improvements in depressive symptoms (d = 0.49), psychological flexibility (d = 0.64), and mindfulness (d = 0.55) compared to the self-help ACT intervention. For health-related quality of life, only the dimension of role limitations caused by emotional problems showed a significant difference in favor of the supported iACT (d = 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the iACT intervention including three video conferencing sessions with a psychologist produced broader improvements in parents' psychological well-being than the self-help ACT. Overall, Internet-delivered interventions and video conferencing technology may offer a feasible alternative to psychological support and self-care for parents of children with chronic conditions. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of the current delivery models.","Lappalainen, Päivi; Pakkala, Inka; Strömmer, Juho; Sairanen, Essi; Kaipainen, Kirsikka; Lappalainen, Raimo",Internet Interv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8010620/,21
16853,Recombinant Production and Characterization of an Extracellular Subtilisin-Like Serine Protease from Acinetobacter baumannii of Fermented Food Origin,2021-04-18,"Recent advances in end-to-end continuous-flow synthesis are rapidly expanding the capabilities of automated customized syntheses of small-molecule pharmacophores, resulting in considerable industrial and societal impacts; however, many hurdles persist that limit the number of sequential steps that can be achieved in such systems, including solvent and reagent incompatibility between individual steps, cumulated by-product formation, risk of clogging and mismatch of timescales between steps in a processing chain. To address these limitations, herein we report a strategy that merges solid-phase synthesis and continuous-flow operation, enabling push-button automated multistep syntheses of active pharmaceutical ingredients. We demonstrate our platform with a six-step synthesis of prexasertib in 65% isolated yield after 32 h of continuous execution. As there are no interactions between individual synthetic steps in the sequence, the established chemical recipe file was directly adopted or slightly modified for the synthesis of twenty-three prexasertib derivatives, enabling both automated early and late-stage diversification.

17259,Noncanonical Transmission of a Measles Virus Vaccine Strain from Neurons to Astrocytes,2021-03-23,"Aluminum-containing adjuvants have been used for nearly 100 years to enhance immune responses in billions of doses of vaccines. To date, only a few adjuvants have been approved for use in humans, among which aluminum-containing adjuvants are the only ones widely used. However, the medical need for potent and safe adjuvants is currently continuously increasing, especially those triggering cellular immune responses for cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation, which are urgently needed for the development of efficient virus and cancer vaccines. Manganese is an essential micronutrient required for diverse biological activities, but its functions in immunity remain undefined. We previously reported that Mn(2+) is important in the host defense against cytosolic dsDNA by facilitating cGAS-STING activation and that Mn(2+) alone directly activates cGAS independent of dsDNA, leading to an unconventional catalytic synthesis of 2′3′-cGAMP. Herein, we found that Mn(2+) strongly promoted immune responses by facilitating antigen uptake, presentation, and germinal center formation via both cGAS-STING and NLRP3 activation. Accordingly, a colloidal manganese salt (Mn jelly, MnJ) was formulated to act not only as an immune potentiator but also as a delivery system to stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses, inducing antibody production and CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell proliferation and activation by either intramuscular or intranasal immunization. When administered intranasally, MnJ also worked as a mucosal adjuvant, inducing high levels of secretory IgA. MnJ showed good adjuvant effects for all tested antigens, including T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antigens, such as bacterial capsular polysaccharides, thus indicating that it is a promising adjuvant candidate.","Zhang, Rui; Wang, Chenguang; Guan, Yukun; Wei, Xiaoming; Sha, Mengyin; Yi, Mengran; Jing, Miao; Lv, Mengze; Guo, Wen; Xu, Jing; Wan, Yi; Jia, Xin-Ming; Jiang, Zhengfan",Cell Mol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8093200/,21
17294,Collaborative transition to open access publishing by scholarly societies,2021-02-15,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of functional performance measures for children and young people with haemophilia (CYPwH) with associated control data from typically developing boys (TDB). The literature advocates development of a core set of outcome measures for different chronic conditions. As medical treatment improves, CYPwH are experiencing better outcomes; therefore, more challenging measures are required to monitor physical performance. Such testing is not performed routinely, due to practical and safety concerns. AIM: Evaluate the feasibility, safety and acceptability of select outcome measures as part of a study protocol testing CYPwH; including myometry, 10 metre incremental shuttle walk test (10-m ISWT), iSTEP (an incremental step test, with data from TDB), and 1 week of accelerometry-wear at home. METHODS: Sixty-six boys aged 6–15 years with mild, moderate or severe haemophilia A or B (including inhibitors) attending routine clinics at Great Ormond Street Hospital were approached to participate. Descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to assess outcomes of feasibility, safety and acceptability, which included recruitment/retention rates, protocol completion within routine appointment timeframes, performance testing without serious adverse events/reactions (SAE/SARs), and acceptability to CYPwH of high-level performance measures. RESULTS: Outcomes were met: 43 boys completed testing at clinic review (Jan–Nov 2018) within a 10-month timeframe, retention was 95% at completion of protocol and no SAE/SARs were reported throughout testing. CONCLUSION: Feasibility, safety and acceptability of the study protocol have been established in this population. Both high-level performance tests, iSTEP and 10-m ISWT, were an acceptable addition to boys’ routine clinic appointments and could be safe, acceptable choices of outcome measure as part of a core set of tests for CYPwH. Further investigation of the psychometric properties for the iSTEP is now justified, in order for it to be used as a standardised, validated, reliable outcome measure in clinical or research settings.

17365,On-demand synthesis of phosphoramidites,2021-05-12,"BACKGROUND: Public mass shootings are a significant public health problem that require ongoing systematic surveillance to test and inform policies that combat gun injuries. Although there is widespread agreement that something needs to be done to stop public mass shootings, opinions on exactly which policies that entails vary, such as the prohibition of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if the Federal Assault Weapons Ban (FAWB) (1994-2004) reduced the number of public mass shootings while it was in place. METHODS: We extracted public mass shooting surveillance data from the Violence Project that matched our inclusion criteria of 4 or more fatalities in a public space during a single event. We performed regression discontinuity analysis, taking advantage of the imposition of the FAWB, which included a prohibition on large-capacity magazines in addition to assault weapons. We estimated a regression model of the 5-year moving average number of public mass shootings per year for the period of 1966 to 2019 controlling for population growth and homicides in general, introduced regression discontinuities in the intercept and a time trend for years coincident with the federal legislation (ie, 1994-2004), and also allowed for a differential effect of the homicide rate during this period. We introduced a second set of trend and intercept discontinuities for post-FAWB years to capture the effects of termination of the policy. We used the regression results to predict what would have happened from 1995 to 2019 had there been no FAWB and also to project what would have happened from 2005 onward had it remained in place. RESULTS: The FAWB resulted in a significant decrease in public mass shootings, number of gun deaths, and number of gun injuries. We estimate that the FAWB prevented 11 public mass shootings during the decade the ban was in place. A continuation of the FAWB would have prevented 30 public mass shootings that killed 339 people and injured an additional 1139 people. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the utility of public health surveillance on gun violence. Surveillance informs policy on whether a ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines reduces public mass shootings. As society searches for effective policies to prevent the next mass shooting, we must consider the overwhelming evidence that bans on assault weapons and/or large-capacity magazines work.","Post, Lori; Mason, Maryann; Singh, Lauren Nadya; Wleklinski, Nicholas P; Moss, Charles B; Mohammad, Hassan; Issa, Tariq Z; Akhetuamhen, Adesuwa I; Brandt, Cynthia A; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James Francis",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8103291/,21

The IFHSS is a proper extension of the intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS) which discusses the parametrization of multi-sub attributes of considered parameters, and accommodates more hesitation comparative to IFSS utilizing the multi sub-attributes of the considered parameters. The main objective of this research is to introduce operational laws for intuitionistic fuzzy hypersoft numbers (IFHSNs). Additionally, based on developed operational laws two aggregation operators (AOs), i.e., intuitionistic fuzzy hypersoft weighted average (IFHSWA) and intuitionistic fuzzy hypersoft weighted geometric (IFHSWG), operators have been presented with their fundamental properties. Furthermore, a decision-making approach has been established utilizing our developed aggregation operators (AOs). Through the established approach, a technique for solving decision-making (DM) complications is proposed to select sustainable suppliers in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). Moreover, a numerical description is presented to ensure the validity and usability of the proposed technique in the DM process.

In order to translationally engage the sonic hedgehog pathway, which is a promising target for neural regeneration, recent studies have reported on the neuroprotective effects of clobetasol, an FDA-approved glucocorticoid, able to activate this pathway via smoothened. Herein we sought to examine functional, cellular, and metabolic effects of clobetasol in a neurotoxic mouse model of spinal motoneuronal loss. We found that clobetasol reduces muscle denervation and motor impairments in part by restoring sonic hedgehog signaling and supporting spinal plasticity. These effects were coupled with reduced pro-inflammatory microglia and reactive astrogliosis, reduced muscle atrophy, and support of mitochondrial integrity and metabolism. Our results suggest that clobetasol stimulates a series of compensatory processes and therefore represents a translational approach for intractable denervating and neurodegenerative disorders.","Vicario, Nunzio; Spitale, Federica M.; Tibullo, Daniele; Giallongo, Cesarina; Amorini, Angela M.; Scandura, Grazia; Spoto, Graziana; Saab, Miriam W.; D’Aprile, Simona; Alberghina, Cristiana; Mangione, Renata; Bernstock, Joshua D.; Botta, Cirino; Gulisano, Massimo; Buratti, Emanuele; Leanza, Giampiero; Zorec, Robert; Vecchio, Michele; Di Rosa, Michelino; Li Volti, Giovanni; Lazzarino, Giuseppe; Parenti, Rosalba; Gulino, Rosario",Cell Death Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8209072/,21

With no licensed vaccine and leading candidates achieving suboptimal protection in the field, the need for an effective immunoprophylactic option continues to motivate the malaria research community to explore alternative technologies. Recent advances in the mRNA discipline have elevated the long-neglected platform to the forefront of infectious disease research. As the immunodominant coat protein of the invasive stage of the malaria parasite, circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) was selected as the antigen of choice to assess the immunogenic and protective potential of an mRNA malaria vaccine. In mammalian cell transfection experiments, PfCSP mRNA was well expressed and cell associated. In the transition to an in vivo murine model, lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulation was applied to protect and deliver the mRNA to the cell translation machinery and supply adjuvant activity. The immunogenic effect of an array of factors was explored, such as formulation, dose, number, and interval of immunizations. PfCSP mRNA-LNP achieved sterile protection against infection with two P. berghei PfCSP transgenic parasite strains, with mRNA dose and vaccination interval having a greater effect on outcome. This investigation serves as the assessment of pre-erythrocytic malaria, PfCSP mRNA vaccine candidate resulting in sterile protection, with numerous factors affecting protective efficacy, making it a compelling candidate for further investigation.","Mallory, Katherine L.; Taylor, Justin A.; Zou, Xiaoyan; Waghela, Ishita N.; Schneider, Cosette G.; Sibilo, Michael Q.; Punde, Neeraja M.; Perazzo, Leah C.; Savransky, Tatyana; Sedegah, Martha; Dutta, Sheetij; Janse, Chris J.; Pardi, Norbert; Lin, Paulo J.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of stress on nurses’ burnout and to identify the mediating effects of secondary traumatic stress and compassion satisfaction among clinical nurses in South Korea. METHODS: A quantitative, cross-sectional study evaluated the survey data from 10,305 female registered hospital nurses who participated in the Korea Nurses’ Health Study (KNHS) Module 5. The survey included a demographic questionnaire and the Professional Quality of Life version 5 (ProQOL 5). Bootstrap analyses (using the PROCESS macro) were employed to evaluate the mediating effect between variables. RESULTS: Stress was significantly associated with burnout and mediated by secondary traumatic stress and compassion satisfaction (β(indirect 1) = 0.185, Bootstrap confidence interval (BS CI) [0.175, 0.194]; β(indirect 2) = 0.226, BS CI [0.212, 0.241], respectively). In addition, the magnitude of the indirect effects of compassion satisfaction was significantly greater than the magnitude of the indirect effects of secondary traumatic stress (β(indirect 1)-β(indirect 2) = − 0.042, BS CI [− 0.058, − 0.026]). The findings of this study indicate that the positive aspect (compassion satisfaction) of work experiences can offset the negative aspects (secondary traumatic stress), consequently reducing burnout level.

18873,Targeting TRIM Proteins: A Quest towards Drugging an Emerging Protein Class,2021-03-18,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of research on technical assistance (TA) interventions in low- and middle-income countries. Variation in local contexts requires tailor-made approaches to TA that are structured and replicable across intervention sites whilst retaining the flexibility to adapt to local contexts. We developed a systematic process of TA using multidisciplinary roving teams to provide support across the various elements comprising local HIV services. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of targeting specific HIV and TB programme indicators for improvement using roving teams. METHOD: We conducted a cluster-randomised stepped-wedge evaluation of a TA support package focussing on clinical, managerial and pharmacy services in the Mopani district of the Limpopo province, South Africa (SA). Three roving teams delivered the intervention. Seventeen primary and community healthcare centres that had 400–600 patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) were selected for inclusion. The TA package was implemented for six consecutive months across facilities until all had received the same level of support. Data were collected from the relevant health management information systems for 11 routine indicators. RESULTS: The mean proportion of PLWH screened for tuberculosis (TB) at ART initiation increased from 85.2% to 87.2% (P = 0.65). Rates of retention in care improved, with the mean proportion of patients retained in care at three months post-ART initiation increasing from 79.9% to 87.4% (P < 0.001) and from 70.3% to 77.7% (P < 0.01) after six months. Finally, the mean proportion of patients with TB who completed their treatment increased from 80.6% to 82.1% (P = 0.75). CONCLUSION: Tailored TA interventions in SA using a standardised structure and process led to a significant improvement in retention-in-care rates and to non-significant improvements in the proportion of PLWH screened for TB and of those who completed their treatment.","Jobson, Geoffrey A.; Railton, Jean; Mutasa, Barry; Ranoto, Lucy; Maluleke, Christine; McIntyre, James; Struthers, Helen; Peters, Remco",South Afr J HIV Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8252139/,21

METHODS: The study used stratified sampling to select 1200 healthcare workers from 30 county hospitals in China to conduct a questionnaire survey. Of these, 1030 were valid questionnaires, and the effective response rate was 85.83%. We collected demographic characteristics of our participants and administered the following scales to them: Workplace Violence, Trait Coping Style, Self-rating Anxiety. Data were statistically analysed. RESULTS: The results showed that 67.28% of healthcare workers in county hospitals in China had experienced workplace violence in the previous 12 months, with prevalent verbal violence (66.12%) followed by physical violence (15.24%). Workplace violence in hospitals was negatively related to positive coping (r=−0.091, p<0.01) but positively related to negative coping (r=0.114, p<0.001) and anxiety (r=0.298, p<0.001). Positive and negative coping was negatively (r=−0.085, p<0.01) and positively (r=0.254, p<0.001) associated with anxiety respectively. Positive and negative coping influenced both hospital workplace violence and anxiety in healthcare workers who were victims of violence. Compared with positive coping, the mediating effect of negative coping was stronger (95% CI −0.177 to –0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of workplace violence among healthcare workers in county-level hospitals in China is relatively high, and there is a correlation between hospital violence, coping styles and anxiety. Positive and negative coping play a mediating role in the impact of hospital violence on healthcare workers’ anxiety. Therefore, hospital administrators should actively promote healthcare workers’ transition to positive coping strategies and minimise the negative impact of anxiety on them.","Ma, Yuanshuo; Wang, Yongchen; Shi, Yu; Shi, Lei; Wang, Licheng; Li, Zhe; Li, Guoqiang; Zhang, Yafeng; Fan, Lihua; Ni, Xin",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8287625/,21

20309,Sfaira accelerates data and model reuse in single cell genomics,2021-08-25,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Human habitual behaviours are strong, long lasting and require less mental energy to perform than other behaviours, and these characteristics present an opportunity for developing pro-animal welfare habitual behaviours (PAWHBs) that benefit horses and donkeys. The routine nature of equine care lends itself to positive habit formation in people. This study addresses a gap in evidence and understanding of the impact of an intervention designed to develop PAWHBs in equine carers. People caring for horses and donkeys were asked to perform an enrichment behaviour with an equine in the form of scratching them in a consistent context linked to an existing routine behaviour. The findings indicated that linking new behaviours to existing routine behaviours can aid the development of pro-animal welfare habits. This also highlighted the role of the equine in triggering the new behaviour to be performed, the potential mutual benefit from engaging in the scratching behaviour for human and equine animal, and the positive emotions resulting from the action, which in turn promotes the repetition of behaviour. The findings mirror the theory of the habit loop: a cue to do a behaviour, the performance of the behaviour in response to the cue, and then the reward for doing the behaviour. ABSTRACT: This paper explores the potential for interventions to develop pro-animal welfare habitual behaviours (PAWHBs) in people to improve the lives of animals. Human behavioural research indicates that opportunities exist to deliver lasting change through developing positive habitual behaviours. The routine nature of many equine care and management practices lends itself to habit formation and maintenance. This proof-of-concept paper aims to evaluate a theory-based intervention of developing and maintaining a PAWHB in people caring for equines. Qualitative research methods were used. A 30 day PAWHB intervention (PAWHBInt) of providing enrichment to an equine by scratching them in a consistent context linked to an existing routine behaviour was undertaken. Participants (n = 9) then engaged in semi-structured interviews that were analysed using thematic analysis, where the participants self-reported the outcomes they observed during the intervention. The study findings suggest that the PAWHBInt had a positive impact on human behaviour and habit formation. The research helps to address the dearth of evidence regarding the application of habit theory to equine welfare interventions and emphasised linking a desired new behaviour to an existing routine behaviour when developing PAWHBs. The research also highlights the role of mutual benefit for human and equine, and emotion in providing feedback and potential reward, supporting the link to the cue-routine-reward principle of habit theory.","White, Jo; Sims, Ruth",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8388501/,21

Maternal infusion of ritodrine (maximum dose, 170 μg/min) had been performed for 7 weeks prior to cesarean section. After resuscitation combined with calcium gluconate, the infant died at 4 months old due to serious respiratory failure accompanied by acute lung injury following shock. No cause of hyperkalemia other than rebound hyperkalemia associated with ritodrine was identified. CONCLUSIONS: This case report serves as a warning regarding the potential risk of neonatal rebound hyperkalemia in association with maternal long-term ritodrine administration.","Osumi, Keita; Suga, Kenichi; Suzue, Masashi; Nakagawa, Ryuji; Kagami, Shoji",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8405715/,21
20700,Helminth–virus interactions: determinants of coinfection outcomes,2021-08-24,"PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of fixed-time-interval oral analgesia and spinal-morphine for management of post-Cesarean pain. METHODS: In this open-label, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial, 200 women due to undergo elective Caesarean section with spinal anaesthesia were enrolled between July 2015 and April 2016. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either spinal fentanyl followed by oral doses of tramadol, paracetamol, and diclofenac at predetermined regular intervals of 6 h for the first 48 h, and rescue treatment with percocet (oxycodone and paracetamol; oral analgesia group), or spinal morphine and rescue treatment with oral tramadol, paracetamol, and diclofenac (spinal-morphine group). The primary outcomes were pain intensity during the postoperative 48 h, measured on a 10-point numeric rating scale (NRS) and expressed as area under the curve (AUC), and the number of breakthrough events of moderate to severe pain (defined as NRS score ≥ 4). RESULTS: The oral analgesia group compared to the spinal-morphine group had similar mean pain intensity (AUC (120 ± 35 versus 121 ± 31, respectively; p = 0.8) but more events of moderate-to-severe breakthrough pain (4.8 ± 2 versus 3.8 ± 1.7, respectively; p = 0.0002). Higher rates and longer durations of pruritus, nausea, and vomiting were reported among patients receiving spinal morphine, as compared with oral analgesia. Satisfaction scores were high in both groups (8.2 ± 2.4 versus 8.7 ± 1.8 in the oral analgesia and spinal morphine, respectively; p = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Both oral analgesia at fixed time intervals and spinal morphine are satisfactory methods for treating post-Caesarean pain.

20749,"Imprecise recombinant viruses evolve via a fitness-driven, iterative process of polymerase template-switching events",2021-08-20,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of infant morbidity and mortality and a potential target for maternal immunization strategies. However, data on the role of RSV in young infant deaths in developing countries are limited. METHODS: We conducted a community-based mortality surveillance from August 2018–March 2020 for infants ≤6 months in Karachi, Pakistan. We tested (reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction) nasopharyngeal swabs from deceased infants for presence of RSV. We performed verbal autopsies and calculated odds of RSV-associated mortality with 95% CIs and used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate associations. RESULTS: We collected 490 nasopharyngeal specimens from 1280 eligible infant deaths. There were 377/490 (76.9%) live births and 14/377 (3.7%; 95% CI: 1.8–5.6) were RSV positive. Most deaths occurred in neonates (254/377; 67.4%), males (226/377; 59.9%), and respiratory illnesses (206/377; 54.6%). Postneonatal age (10/14, 71.4%; OR: 5.5; 95% CI: 1.7–18.0), respiratory symptoms (12/14, 85.7%; OR: 5.2; 1.2–23.7), and high RSV season (9/14, 64.3%; OR: 4.4; 1.4–13.3) were associated with RSV mortality. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, respiratory symptoms (OR: 6.6; 95% CI: 1.3–32.5), RSV seasonality (6.1; 1.8–20.4), and age (9.2; 2.6–33.1) were significant predictors of RSV-associated mortality. CONCLUSIONS: RSV has a significant mortality burden in early infancy in Karachi, Pakistan. Age, RSV seasonality, and respiratory symptoms were significant predictors of RSV-associated mortality. Our findings have implications for clinical management of young infants with cold-like symptoms, policy development, and research regarding maternal immunization against RSV during pregnancy, in resource-constrained, low-income, and vaccine-hesitant populations.","Kazi, Abdul Momin; Aguolu, Obianuju G; Mughis, Waliyah; Ahsan, Nazia; Jamal, Saima; Khan, Ayub; Qureshi, Hanya M; Yildirim, Inci; Malik, Fauzia A; Omer, Saad B",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8411247/,21

Leaves: Pivotal Functions of Bioactives on RAS Signaling Pathway and Its Associated Target Proteins against Gout,2021-08-29,"(1) Background: To analyze incidence, clinical characteristics, procedures, and in-hospital outcomes among patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) according to the presence of T2DM in Spain (2016–2019) and to assess the role of gender among those with T2DM. (2) Methods: Using the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database, we estimated hospitalized CAP incidence. Propensity score matching was used to compare population subgroups. (3) Results: CAP was coded in 520,723 patients, of whom 140,410 (26.96%) had T2DM. The hospitalized CAP incidence was higher in patients with T2DM (both sexes) (IRR 4.25; 95% CI 4.23–4.28). The hospitalized CAP incidence was higher in men with T2DM than in women with T2DM (IRR 1.46; 95% CI 1.45–1.47). The hospitalized CAP incidence among T2DM patients increased over time; however, the in-hospital mortality (IHM) decreased between 2016 and 2019. IHM was higher among non-T2DM men and women than matched T2DM men and women (14.23% and 14.22% vs. 12.13% and 12.91%; all p < 0.001, respectively), After adjusting for confounders, men with T2DM had a 6% higher mortality risk than women (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.02–1.1). (4) Conclusions: T2DM is associated with a higher hospitalized CAP incidence and is increasing overtime. Patients hospitalized with CAP and T2DM have lower IHM.

Adequate nutrient composition could influence bone health and help to maximize peak bone mass. Therefore, children’s nutrition may have lifelong consequences. Also, physical activity, adequate in volume or intensity, may have positive consequences on bone mineral content and density and may preserve bone loss in adulthood. Most of the literature that exists for children, about diet and physical activity on bone health, has been translated from studies conducted in adults. Thus, there are still many unanswered questions about what type of diet and physical activity may positively influence skeletal development. This review focuses on bone requirements in terms of nutrients and physical activity in childhood and adolescence to promote bone health. It explores the contemporary scientific literature that analyzes the impact of diet together with the typology and timing of physical activity that could be more appropriate depending on whether they are children and adolescents to assure an optimal skeleton formation. A description of the role of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and gut hormones (gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, and GLP-2) as potential candidates in this interaction to promote bone health is also presented.","Proia, Patrizia; Amato, Alessandra; Drid, Patrik; Korovljev, Darinka; Vasto, Sonya; Baldassano, Sara",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473684/,21
21836,Proximate Analysis of Poultry-Mix Formed Feed Using Maize Bran as a Base,2021-09-21,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most frequent adult-onset motor neuron disorder. The disease is characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to death usually within five years after the onset of symptoms. While most cases are sporadic, 5%-10% of cases can be associated with familial inheritance, including ALS type 6, which is associated with mutations in the Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) gene. This work aimed to evaluate how the most frequent ALS-related mutations in FUS, R521C, R521H, and P525L affect the protein structure and function. We used prediction algorithms to analyze the effects of the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms and performed evolutionary conservation analysis, protein frustration analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations. Most of the prediction algorithms classified the three mutations as deleterious. All three mutations were predicted to reduce protein stability, especially the mutation R521C, which was also predicted to increase chaperone binding tendency. The protein frustration analysis showed an increase in frustration in the interactions involving the mutated residue 521C. Evolutionary conservation analysis showed that residues 521 and 525 of human FUS are highly conserved sites. The molecular dynamics results indicate that protein stability could be compromised in all three mutations. They also affected the exposed surface area and protein compactness. The analyzed mutations also displayed high flexibility in most residues in all variants, most notably in the interaction site with the nuclear import protein of FUS.","Bonet, L. F. S.; Loureiro, J.

22023,Successful management of a kitten with chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin toxicosis with pralidoxime and atropine,2021-09-30,"Class A β-lactamases are known for being able to rapidly gain broad spectrum catalytic efficiency against most β-lactamase inhibitor combinations as a result of elusively minor point mutations. The evolution in class A β-lactamases occurs through optimisation of their dynamic phenotypes at different timescales. At long-timescales, certain conformations are more catalytically permissive than others while at the short timescales, fine-grained optimisation of free energy barriers can improve efficiency in ligand processing by the active site. Free energy barriers, which define all coordinated movements, depend on the flexibility of the secondary structural elements. The most highly conserved residues in class A β-lactamases are hydrophobic nodes that stabilize the core. To assess how the stable hydrophobic core is linked to the structural dynamics of the active site, we carried out adaptively sampled molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in four representative class A β-lactamases (KPC-2, SME-1, TEM-1, and SHV-1). Using Markov State Models (MSM) and unsupervised deep learning, we show that the dynamics of the hydrophobic nodes is used as a metastable relay of kinetic information within the core and is coupled with the catalytically permissive conformation of the active site environment. Our results collectively demonstrate that the class A enzymes described here, share several important dynamic similarities and the hydrophobic nodes comprise of an informative set of dynamic variables in representative class A β-lactamases.","Olehnovics, Edgar; Yin, Junqi; Pérez, Adrià; De Fabritiis, Gianni; Bonomo, Robert A.; Bhowmik, Debsindhu; Haider, Shozeb",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8490755/,21

Infections caused by these bacteria are resistant to the last resort of antibiotic therapy and have posed a major challenge in clinical and public health. Since the production of new antibiotics is very expensive and also very slow compared to the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance, researchers are suggesting the use of natural substances with high antibacterial potential. Bacteriophages are one of the most effective therapeutic measures that are known to exist for use for incurable and highly resistant infections. Phages are highly taken into consideration due to the lack of side effects, potential spread to various body organs, distinct modes of action from antibiotics, and proliferation at the site of infection. Although the effects of phages on MDR and XDR bacteria have been demonstrated in various studies, only a few have investigated the effect of phage therapy on colistin-resistant isolates. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the problems caused by colistin-resistant MDR and XDR bacteria in the clinics, explain the different mechanisms associated with colistin resistance, introduce bacteriophage therapy as a powerful remedy, and finally present new studies that have used bacteriophages against colistin-resistant isolates.","Mousavi, Seyed Mohammad; Babakhani, Sajad; Moradi, Leila; Karami, Saina; Shahbandeh, Mahsa; Mirshekar, Maryam; Mohebi, Samane; Moghadam, Majid Taati",Curr Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8503728/,21

To address these challenges, numerous technologies and therapies are under development. Most of these strategies aim to reduce the frequency of injections, thereby increasing patient compliance and reducing patient-associated burden. Unlike IVT frequent injections, molecular therapies such as cell therapy and gene therapy offer restoration ability hence gained a lot of traction. The recent approval of ocular gene therapy for inherited disease offers new hope in this direction. However, until such breakthrough therapies are available to the majority of patients, antibody therapeutics will be on the shelf, continuing to provide therapeutic benefits.

22541,Recently published papers in the field of molecular evolution,1987,"BACKGROUND: One in three people in the U.S. will develop herpes zoster during their life. Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL or Zostavax™), has been licensed in the U.S. since 2006 to prevent herpes zoster. ZVL protection has been shown to wane with time and estimates of effect can be imprecise. We performed a systematic review of the duration of efficacy and effectiveness of ZVL against herpes zoster (HZ). METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and clinicaltrials.gov for vaccine efficacy or effectiveness (VE) studies of ZVL. Two authors independently screened each title and abstract, and potential VE studies were reviewed in-depth. Eligibility criteria included original data on ZVL prevention of HZ in a general population of immunocompetent recipients ≤ 60 years old. Selected articles were abstracted, independently reviewed, and discrepancies adjudicated. We attempted to locate relevant unpublished work and contacted authors for additional data, where necessary. Measures of association were illustrated on a forest plot and converted to VE (1-hazard ratio or risk ratio or odds ratio). RESULTS: We screened 1302 articles; 17 underwent full text review and 8 met inclusion criteria and were abstracted for this review. Selected studies included 1 phase III randomized controlled trial, 2 quasi experimental and 5 observational studies. One experimental and 5 observational studies estimated VE during the period from vaccination up to 4 years following vaccination; estimates across studies ranged from 33%-55%. Two quasi experimental and 3 observational studies estimated VE for ≥ 4 years following vaccination; estimates ranged from 19%-40%; the median estimate was 24% (Figure). Pooled VE was not calculated due to heterogeneity in length of follow up, age distribution of study subjects, as well as adjustment for factors such as underlying medical conditions. CONCLUSION: Most experimental and observational studies estimate VE just above 50% during the 3 years following receipt of ZVL. Beyond 3 years, ZVL protection wanes, with most studies estimating a VE of ≤24% after 4 years. Information on overall efficacy and duration of protection from ZVL will guide policy decisions regarding its use. DISCLOSURES: E.

22542,Bovine herpesvirus 1 and caprine herpesvirus 1: Viral polypeptides exhibiting shared and unique antigenic determinants,1986,"BACKGROUND: Personal protective equipment (PPE) and strict infection control techniques are the primary methods by which healthcare workers (HCW) can avoid exposure during the treatment of patients with highly pathogenic infections such as Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) or the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). There is currently no consensus for the types of PPE that are recommended to be worn by HCWs, nor is there a universal process for the donning and doffing of PPE. METHODS: HCWs from Bellevue Hospital participate in quarterly PPE trainings as part of the Special Pathogens Program (SPP), which consist of didactic sessions as well as an evaluation of donning and doffing techniques. A total of 50 HCWs completed the training curriculum in 2017. During the doffing process, PPE trainers applied corn start powder paint (Chameleon Colors; American Fork, UT) to the participants’ gloved hands between multiple steps of PPE removal. At the end of the process, the areas where paint was found on was documented including the outer surgical gown, the powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) helmet and shroud, the inner impermeable suit, the knee-high boots and boot covers, and the extended-cuff gloves. RESULTS: The areas of PPE that were most marked with paint were the lower shoulders and upper arms of the surgical gowns, the top sides of the PAPR shroud, the front upper chest area, and the center back of the inner impermeable suits. In a majority of cases no powder paint was noted on the knee-high boots. In a minority of cases, paint was observed on the inside upper chest area of the surgical gown. These paint markings were used to discuss potential breaches in PPE doffing technique in real-time, as well as identify areas to target in future PPE trainings. CONCLUSION: The powdered paint quality improvement process for donning and doffing PPE is a method to evaluate the complex PPE dressing procedure. It is particularly useful given the fact that it is incumbent on each hospital or healthcare system to develop its own processes and procedures for PPE, as well as maintain readiness through periodic trainings. Powdered paint can identify vulnerabilities in their process as well as areas that require further education.

22546,"Contents of Volume 31, 2005",2005,"BACKGROUND: In asthmatic children, 60–80% of exacerbations are triggered by respiratory pathogens and represent an important burden of illness. The impact of pathogens on exacerbation severity and treatment response remains unclear. Our aim was to describe the prevalence of respiratory pathogens in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) and investigate the association between pathogens and (i) exacerbation severity on presentation and (ii) ED treatment failure. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of the DOORWAY study, a prospective multi-center cohort of children (1–17 years) presenting to the ED with moderate or severe asthma exacerbation. All received per protocol oral corticosteroids and bronchodilators. Nasopharyngeal (NPA) secretions were analyzed by RT-PCR for 30 different pathogens. Linear and logistic multivariate regression models were used to estimate absolute risks and risk differences (RD) with their 95% CI representing average marginal effects. RESULTS: Of 958 patients with NPA specimens, 591 (61.7%) were positive for ≥ 1 pathogens; human rhinovirus (HRV) was the most prevalent (29.4%). Non-HRV infection (RD -12.9%; 95% CI -19.5; -6.3), human metapneumovirus (RD -13.6%; 95% CI -23.0%; -4.3%) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) (RD -31.7%; 95% CI -44.5%; -18.9%) were negatively associated with severity; no association was found between severity and the presence of any pathogen, co-infection, or the specific viruses HRV-A, HRV-B, HRV-C, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza (INF), enterovirus serotype D68, adenovirus or coronavirus. The risk of treatment failure in the absence of a pathogen was 12.5% (95% CI 9.0%; 16.0%). The presence of any pathogen (RD 8.2%; 95% CI 3.3%; 13.1%) and non-HRV infection as a group (RD 13.1%; 95% CI 6.4%; 19.8%), and of INF and PIV specifically (RD 24.9%; 95% CI 4.7%; 45.1% and RD 34.1%; 95% CI 7.5%; 60.7%) were positively associated with treatment failure. CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of children with moderate or severe exacerbation, no single respiratory pathogen was associated with higher severity on presentation. However, in addition to any pathogen and non-HVR infection, INF and PIV were specifically associated with higher treatment failure in the ED, supporting the need for influenza prevention, pathogen identification at presentation and exploration of pathogen-therapy interaction.

22558,Restriction site maps of a new type of bovine herpesvirus 1,1986,"BACKGROUND: More than 90% of active duty personnel receive influenza vaccinations yearly. Despite high coverage, influenza-like illnesses (ILI) remain a frequent cause of missed duty and hospitalizations, particularly in U.S. military recruits. More research is needed on the epidemiology and etiology of ILI to reduce the burden of respiratory infections in congregated military settings. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess ILI patterns among US Army recruits in a 9-week basic combat training course at Ft. Benning, GA. Demographic data, vaccination history, and information on recent illness were collected at enrollment in January 2017. Participants were divided into two platoons with staggered biweekly visit schedules. Visits occurred from reception through training, with nasal swabs and symptom surveys (all visits) and blood draws (weeks 8 and 9). Nasal specimens were used to detect clinical and colonizing pathogens using the Diatherix TEM-PCR Respiratory Panel. RESULTS: A total of 90 recruits were enrolled in the study. Twelve recruits were lost due to training attrition in the first week of the study. The participants were male and the mean age was 23 yo (SD 4.9). There were 10 (13%) cases of ILI reported among the 78 remaining participants, 6 in week 1, 3 in week 2 and 1 in week 9. The most frequently detected pathogens in the 10 symptomatic cases were coronavirus (5, 50%), rhinovirus (4, 40%), other enterovirus (3, 30%), and influenza A (2, 20%). Pathogen co-detections were common, 8 out 10 cases were associated with 2 pathogens, representing 7 unique combinations. While rhinovirus and coronavirus were most common among asymptomatic trainees, 10% had detectable influenza A. Detection of multiple pathogens was common in the first two weeks of training (50% among those who had viral detection). The study is still in progress. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic ILI was associated with coronavirus, rhinovirus, and enterovirus, in addition to influenza in the early weeks of training. Coronavirus and rhinovirus also circulated widely among healthy recruits, along with influenza. The findings will inform ILI control strategies for congregated military trainees. DISCLOSURES: E.

METHODS: We performed retrospective review of hospitalized cases of confirmed influenza infection from October 2010 to April 2017. Patient’s data were collected from three referral hospitals in different regions of the country. RESULTS: A total 2,002 laboratory confirmed influenza cases were identified. The median age was 3.3 years old (range 0.0–18.9 years) and 1,003 patients were male (54%). Influenza A was diagnosed in 1,357 cases (68%), influenza B in 624 (31%) and both influenza A and B in 21 (1%). Other combined respiratory virus infection was detected in 104 (5.2%) cases. Out of 2,002 cases, IANCs were identified in 167 cases (8.3%); influenza virus A was detected in 116 (69.4%), B in 50 (29.9%) and both A and B in one case (0.6%). Of 167 cases with IANCs, 25 patients (15%) had underlying neurologic diseases. Eleven patients (11/167, 6.5%) had combined respiratory viral infection (Rhinovirus = 5; respiratory syncytial virus = 3; coronavirus = 2; and bocavirus = 1). The most common diagnosis was a simple febrile seizure (112/167, 67.1%), followed by other seizures (26/167, 15.6%), encephalopathy/encephalitis (17/167, 10.2%), meningitis (7/167, 4.2%), meningism (4/167, 2.4%) and acute ataxia (1/167, 0.6%). In two patients with encephalitis/meningitis, one patient had influenza A and the other patient had influenza B detected by PCR in cerebrospinal fluid. Most of the patients were fully recovered (162/167, 97%) and no neurologic complication occurred in patients who had only initial manifestation of simple febrile seizure. Ten patients (10/167, 6.0%) required hospitalization in intensive care unit. Three patients (3/167, 1.8%) died of encephalopathy (n = 1) and combined encephalopathy/myocarditis (n = 2). Pre-existing neurologic disease was a risk factor of IANCs with an odds ratio of 3.94 (95% confidence interval 2.37 to 6.56, P < 0.0001).

This study's aim was to examine the views of lay people in Guinea on the acceptability of community quarantine. From June to August 2016, 302 adults indicated the acceptability of quarantine in 36 scenarios varying as a function of four factors: the infectious disease's level of contagiousness, its level of lethality, the number of cases in the community and whether persons in quarantine are provided with support services.

22640,Virus rejection with two model human enteric viruses in membrane bioreactor system,2007,"Sepsis clinically manifests as life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection.(1) Optimal fluid resuscitation is relevant for all sepsis patients, and perhaps it is most important for those with septic shock. Septic shock is defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greatest risk of mortality, and septic shock is clinically identified as sepsis patients with serum lactate level >2 mmol/L and who require vasopressor infusion to maintain a mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg in the absence of hypovolemia. Sepsis is among the most common conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), accounting for up to half of all hospital deaths and being the third leading cause of death overall in the United States.(2) Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies for which treatment and resuscitation should begin immediately. The goals of fluid resuscitation for these patients are: a) to rapidly replace intravascular volume and restore tissue perfusion, and b) to minimize organ dysfunction through timely interventions that either halt or reverse the physiologic derangements. If hypoperfusion is present, at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid should be given rapidly, and additional fluids should be guided by frequent reassessment of hemodynamic status, preferably using dynamic indices to indicate the likelihood of a beneficial response to fluid administration. Fluid administration should be targeted to achieve a MAP of at least 65 mm Hg, and to normalize lactate in patients with elevated lactate due to hypoperfusion.(3) Balanced crystalloids are the fluid of first choice for sepsis resuscitation based on ready availability and taking medication costs into account. Use of 0.9% saline compared to a balanced crystalloid, such as lactated Ringer's or PlasmaLyte, produces more kidney dysfunction and with a greater risk of dying.(4) The individual side effect profiles may best differentiate the natural and synthetic colloids. Albumin may be considered for administration to sepsis patients with refractory shock or who have received substantial amounts of crystalloid fluids, but should not be administered to patients with severe traumatic brain injury.(5) Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) products should not be administered to patients with sepsis because of increased risk of acute kidney injury and death. Gelatin solutions are not recommended in sepsis. Norepinephrine is the vasopressor of first choice for patients with septic shock, and should be administered to achieve a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg after excluding hypovolemia as a cause for hypotension. The selection of a second line vasopressor, such as vasopressin, dopamine, phenylephrine, epinephrine or angiotensin-2, depends on patient factors such as underlying cardiac dysfunction, presence of arrhythmias, and current response to vasoconstrictor or inotropic agents. Dopamine should not be used for renal perfusion or protection and it should be avoided in patients with tachyarrhythmias.","Martin, Greg S.",Qatar Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6851923/,21

Economic conditions affect HIV/AIDS and, in turn, HIV/AIDS affects an economy at both the macro and micro levels. Thus, the link works in both directions. In this chapter, we examine the relationships between HIV/AIDS and poverty, inequality and social capital, and consider whether economic differences between countries explain differences in HIV prevalence. As we have noted in Chap. 3, HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects people of working age. In this chapter, we examine the potential economic impact of HIV/AIDS, using a macroeconomic model. This is followed by a review of microeconomic and epidemiological models that try to answer questions about the behavioral response of people who are either at risk of or actually living with HIV/AIDS. Such studies provide a useful mechanism for determining the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS prevention strategies (a topic we explore further in Chap. 9). Economics plays a significant role in the propagation of HIV/AIDS in high incidence countries.

Steady state conditions are rarely constant but evolutionary adaptation is too slow to adapt to daily threats so a surrogate variation mechanism is necessary. The genome defines the most basic instructions for life so that a molecular biology perspective provides the foundation for understanding resilience. Variations in the expression of RNA offers rapid variation and this book proposes this is the basis of resilience. This book attempts to illuminate mechanisms of resilience beginning with elaborating threats leading to disruption in steady state conditions. Recognition of threats and defense systems are described followed by adaptive changes in gene expression that refine responses. Finally, environmental conditions are discussed that serve to dampen the adaptive response oscillator to disruptive threats at the level of RNA expression. This prologue is intended to acquaint the reader with my background and the genesis of optimism for an idea that the benefit of transcriptome plasticity is resilience. I grew up in several National Parks, remote regions of the United States that are set aside to preserve natural environments. I attended 12 schools by the time I graduated from high school, a fact that forced me to develop personal resilience.

24436,Virtual Screening and Molecular Design Based on Hierarchical Qsar Technology,2009-06-25,"Colchicine is an alkaloid which was originally extracted from bulbs of a plant called Colchicum autumnale (meadow saffron). Its active pharmacological component was isolated in 1820 and in 1833 the active ingredient was purified and named colchicine. It consists of three hexameric rings termed A, B, and C. It was first recommended for the treatment of gout by Alexander of Tralles in the sixth century AD. Later it has been employed for suggested and approved indications including primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), alcohol induced hepatitis, psoriasis, Behçet disease, Sweet syndrome, scleroderma, sarcoidosis and amyloidosis. Perhaps the most effective results have been obtained in the prophylaxis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Colchicine is absorbed in the jejunum and ileum and is trapped in the body tissues. It is metabolized in the liver and the intestine by cytochrome P (CYP) 450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (PGY) 1. Colchicine is excreted mainly by the biliary system, intestines and the kidneys. It has a narrow therapeutic range, but with normal liver and kidney functions is relatively safe and can be used during pregnancy, nursing and in infants. The main mechanism of action of colchicine is probably through interaction with microtubules affecting leukocyte chemotaxis, thereby suppressing inflammation. The blood level of colchicine may be affected by concomitant drug administration and therefore, caution should be exercised when such medications are added.","Ben-Chetrit, Eldad",Textbook of Autoinflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120738/,21

Preventing these infections relies on infection control measures and antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis. While infection control measures are safe (but not always effective), the use of antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis of infection is not devoid of problems. Its wide use may increase the possibility of the development of resistance, select for resistant organisms, and increase toxicity and cost. Therefore, any attempt to administer an antimicrobial agent should be accompanied by a reflection of the potential benefits and risks of prophylaxis.","Nucci, Marcio; Anaissie, Elias J.; Dignani, Maria Cecilia; Mahfouz, Tahsine",Neoplastic Diseases of the Blood,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121527/,21

25273,Basics of Molecular Biology,2013-07-19,"The arenaviruses are a large family of emerging negative-stranded RNA viruses that include several severe human pathogens causing hemorrhagic fevers with high mortality. During the arenavirus life cycle, processing of the viral envelope glycoprotein precursor (GPC) by the cellular subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 (SKI-1)/site-1 protease (S1P) is crucial for productive infection. The ability of newly emerging arenaviruses to hijack human SKI-1/S1P is a key factor for zoonotic transmission and human disease potential. Apart from being an essential host factor for arenavirus infection, SKI-1/S1P is involved in the regulation of important physiological processes and linked to major human diseases. This chapter provides an overview of the mechanisms of arenavirus GPC processing by SKI-1/S1P including recent findings. We will highlight to what extent the molecular mechanisms of SKI-1/S1P cleavage of viral GPC differ from processing of SKI-1/S1P’s cellular substrates and discuss the implications for virus-host interaction and coevolution. Moreover, we will show how the use of the viral GPC as a “molecular probe” uncovered novel and unusual aspects of SKI-1/S1P biosynthesis and maturation. The crucial role of SKI-1/S1P in arenavirus infection and other major human diseases combined with its nature as an enzyme makes SKI-1/S1P further an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. In the last part, we will therefore cover past and present efforts to identify specific SKI-1/S1P inhibitors.","Pasquato, Antonella; Cendron, Laura; Kunz, Stefan",Activation of Viruses by Host Proteases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121819/,21

The presence of so many volunteers and donations can be of great help during a disaster if properly managed.

Autophagy (macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy) is a self-digestive process in response to environmental stress to eukaryotic cells, by which cytoplasmic components are delivered to the lysosome for recycling and degradation. The oxidative stress response is directed against any oxidative stress and is mediated by antioxidative defense systems including antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, detoxifying enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, and energy-dependent efflux pumps. The heat shock response is induced upon exposure of cells to any stress condition and characterized by emission of heat shock proteins which operate as DAMPs to maintain and restore homeostasis. The unfolded protein response is induced by any stress of the endoplasmic reticulum that is perceived by three sensor molecules. Under remediable endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions, the sensors trigger signalling pathways to resolve this stress. However, in severe irremediable endoplasmic reticulum stress, the unfolded protein response may lead to pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic responses resulting in regulated cell death. Finally, the DNA damage response is induced by any DNA damage that occurs in a variety of exogenous and endogenous conditions. When successful, this stress response leads to DNA repair and is associated with the emission of various DAMPs which contribute to restoration of homeostasis. When unsuccessful, the DNA damage response, like the unsuccessful unfolded protein response, can result in regulated cell death, either in form of apoptosis or necrosis. Together, the ultimate goal of all the stress responses is to maintain cellular homeostasis and ensure cell integrity. When they fail, the incidence of regulated cell death is frequently observed.","Land, Walter Gottlieb",Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns in Human Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122488/,21

Thus, validation of protein structures is essential for the spectroscopists, since it could enable them to detect structural flaws and potentially guide their efforts in further refinement. Moreover, availability of accurate and efficient validation tools would help molecular biologists and computational chemists to evaluate quality of available experimental structures and to select a protein model which is the most suitable for a given scientific problem. The (13)C(α) nuclei are ubiquitous in proteins, moreover, their shieldings are easily obtainable from NMR experiments and represent a rich source of encoded structural information that makes (13)C(α) chemical shifts an attractive candidate for use in computational methods aimed at determination and validation of protein structures. In this chapter, the basis of a novel methodology of computing, at the quantum chemical level of theory, the (13)C(α) shielding for the amino acid residues in proteins is described. We also identify and examine the main factors affecting the (13)C(α)-shielding computation. Finally, we illustrate how the information encoded in the (13)C chemical shifts can be used for a number of applications, viz., from protein structure prediction of both α-helical and β-sheet conformations, to determination of the fraction of the tautomeric forms of the imidazole ring of histidine in proteins as a function of pH or to accurate detection of structural flaws, at a residue-level, in NMR-determined protein models.","Vila, Jorge A.; Arnautova, Yelena A.",Computational Methods to Study the Structure and Dynamics of Biomolecules and Biomolecular Processes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123919/,21
26905,The Twenty-Third International Conference on Antiviral Research,2010-04-22,"Cycloaddition reactions for site-specific or global modification of nucleic acids have enabled the preparation of a plethora of previously inaccessible DNA and RNA constructs for structural and functional studies on naturally occurring nucleic acids, the assembly of nucleic acid nanostructures, therapeutic applications, and recently, the development of novel aptamers. In this chapter, recent progress in nucleic acid functionalization via a range of different cycloaddition (click) chemistries is presented. At first, cycloaddition/click chemistries already used for modifying nucleic acids are summarized, ranging from the wellestablished copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne–azide cycloaddition reaction to copper free methods, such as the strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition, tetrazole-based photoclick chemistry and the inverse electron demand Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction between strained alkenes and tetrazine derivatives. The subsequent sections contain selected applications of nucleic acid functionalization via click chemistry; in particular, site-specific enzymatic labeling in vitro, either via DNA and RNA recognizing enzymes or by introducing unnatural base pairs modified for click reactions. Further sections report recent progress in metabolic labeling and fluorescent detection of DNA and RNA synthesis in vivo, click nucleic acid ligation, click chemistry in nanostructure assembly and click-SELEX as a novel method for the selection of aptamers.","Kath-Schorr, Stephanie",Cycloadditions in Bioorthogonal Chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123942/,21

Embracing good financial inclusion (FI) schemes in a country helps to ensure that entrepreneurs of SSB have access to financial services and hence meet their needs. In this paper we studied FI scheme in Kingdom of Eswatini with the view to establish the extent to which SSB have access to funds in running their businesses such that they could satisfy the target population and meet their desired goals. We got FI dataset for Eswatini for 2018 from Finscope database. Finscope 2018 dataset contains 1385 attributes with 2928 records. This study extracted attributes based on payment channel, registered/unregistered business, usage of commercial banks/insurance/mobile money and source of income for households from the Finscope database. We identified lot of missing data and hence replaced them using Mode method of preprocessing module in WEKA. We split the datasets and carried out cross validation on it. Training data is 80% of the datasets and 20% was used for testing. We carefully classified FI for selected parameters for Hhohho, Manzini, Shiselweni and Lubombo regions of Eswatini using Logistic regression with 80% for training and 10 fold cross-validation. The best 10 fold cross-validation recall rate for Manzini region using support vector machine (SVM) is 69.4% and 63.4% using logistic regression. These results show that veracity of FI dataset is weak and this is due to large number of missing data.","Akinnuwesi, Boluwaji A.; Fashoto, Stephen G.; Metfula, Andile S.; Akinnuwesi, Adetutu N.","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134229/,21

Since the turn of the century, China has been a source of numerous infectious disease outbreaks. It is also the origin of the MCR-1 gene, which confers resistance to colistin, a “last-line” antibiotic deployed against multidrug-resistant infections. With the largest population in the world, coupled with its status as a major supplier of agricultural produce, evaluating Chinese responses to AMR is critical to understanding the efficacy of the global response. Drawing on knowledge of both Chinese politics and health security, this article analyzes how Chinese actors have responded to the threat in the public and animal health sectors as well as the domestic and international implications of these responses. Based on interviews with key Chinese and international officials, scientists, and public health specialists, as well as farmers and consumers, we argue that the securitization of AMR in China is currently more concerned with domestic policy and resource competition than with addressing the existential health threat. Without a greater alignment of AMR strategies within China, macrosecuritizing efforts to address the threat globally cannot succeed.","Thomas, Nicholas; Lo, Catherine Yuk-ping",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149462/,21

The nidoviruses genome is an infectious, linear, positive sense RNA molecule, which is capped and polyadenylated. Based on the genome size, they are divided into two groups large and small nidoviruses. The genomes of the large nidoviruses are well over 25 kb in length with size differences in the 5 kb range. Based on the genome size, they can be distinguished into two groups, large and small nidoviruses. The genomes of the large nidoviruses are well over 25 kb in length with size differences in the 5 kb range. Although the structural proteins of the nidoviruses are generally functionally equivalent, there is no firm indication that any single protein species is evolutionary conserved across all of the families. Members of the family Coronaviridae generally possess three or four envelope proteins. The most abundant one is the membrane (M) protein. Though different in sequence, the M proteins of corona-, toro-, and bafiniviruses are alike in size, structure, and presumably also in function. Nidoviruses have lipid envelopes, which are commonly acquired by budding at membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, intermediate compartment and/or Golgi complex. In coronaviruses, the S protein is an important target for T cell responses and is the major inducer of virus-neutralizing antibodies, which are elicited by epitopes located mostly in the N-terminal half of the molecule.",,Virus Taxonomy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150239/,21

31323,Complications of Viral and Mycoplasmal Infections in Rodents to Toxicology Research and Testing,2016-04-07,"The complement system is an important part of the innate immune system. The activation of complement proceeds through three different pathways that converge in the generation of C3‐activating enzyme complexes. Complement activation via the lectin pathway is initiated when recognition molecules, mannan‐binding lectin (MBL) or ficolin, bind to carbohydrate structures characteristic for microbial surfaces. In the circulation, MBL and ficolins are found in association with three structurally related MBL‐associated serine proteases (MASP)‐1, ‐2 and ‐3 and a small, nonenzymatic component, MAp19. MASP‐2 has been shown to elicit complement activation through the sequential proteolytic cleavage of C4 and C2 upon binding of MBL/MASP‐2 complexes to microbial surfaces. We have recently uncovered a polymorphism in the MASP‐2/MAp19 gene in a patient shown to be deficient in the lectin pathway of complement activation. The polymorphism results in a single amino acid substitution in the N‐terminal part of the MASP‐2 protein. Recombinant wildtype MASP‐2 and MASP‐2 containing the amino acid substitution in question was produced, and the ability to activate complement was studied. The mutation had a profound impact on MASP‐2 function, resulting in the lack of complement activation through the lectin pathway. ELISA‐based experiments showed that the mutation leads to the impairment of complement activation through influencing the binding of MASP‐2 to MBL or ficolins. Deficiencies in the lectin pathway of complement activation have so far been accounted for only by lack of functional MBL. The mutation described above is the first defect described affecting both activation through MBL and the ficolins.","Sørensen, R.; Gadjeva, M.; Thiel, S.; Jensenius, J.

Within the TNF system, the two agonists, TNF‐α and TNF‐β, also called lymphotoxin‐α (LT), are bound by soluble TNF receptors (sTNFR‐I and ‐II) that act as natural inhibitors of TNF‐induced inflammation. We investigated the plasma levels of sTNFR‐I in parallel with LT‐binding capacity (LTBC) in patients with JIA. Methods: The levels of sTNFR‐I were measured by ELISA (R&D). LTBC was determined by spiking diluted plasma samples with recombinant LT. Detectable LT was measured by an in‐house ELISA measuring unbound LT only. LTBC was expressed in arbitrary units (AUs) as the percentage value of bound LT to added LT. Result: In contrast to previous findings of elevated sTNFR levels in patients with various chronic inflammatory diseases, we found slightly reduced sTNFR‐I levels in JIA patients (n = 123) compared with age‐matched healthy controls (n = 37): 1077 pg/ml (819–2280) versus 1185 pg/ml (625–2303) [median (range)], P = 0015. However, the sTNFR‐I levels correlated positively with the number of active joints, physicians' global assessment and CRP. In contrast, patient LTBC values were elevated compared to healthy controls: 44 AU (36–52) versus 31 AU (13–41), P < 0.0001. Conclusion: Despite overall slightly reduced plasma levels of sTNFR‐I, the capacity to bind TNF was increased in plasma samples from JIA patients. Studies to identify the TNF‐binding substances in plasma are in progress.","Bjoernhart, B.; Svenningsen, P.; Gudbrandsdottir, S.; Zak, M.; Nielsen, S.; Bentzen, K.; Müller, K.",Scand J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169560/,21

The purpose of the paper is to present critical insights into the manner in which learning can be facilitated through VCPs using our own experiences as an example. The paper begins with a discussion of the authors' methodology before moving to a literature review addressing VCP’s and related elements of entrepreneurial education best practice. It then shifts to a critical discussion of the authors' experiences based on insights, student and staff evaluations, and course data. In the process of conducting this review the authors found that good pedagogical design, in a VCP context, needs to focus on ensuring that academics promote constructive alignment between the curriculum that is ‘taught’, the teaching methods used, the learning environment chosen and the assessment procedures adopted. Only by minimising inconsistencies which link these factors will students’ experiences of venture creation be fully engaging, promoting more effective, experiential and entrepreneurial development. This paper provides educators with an original and experiential insight into the design of a VCP programme and the pedagogical developments required for their successful implementation. There is considerable value herein for higher education institutions which want to design a new VCP, especially with reference to the curriculum design, experiential learning activities, types and methods of assessments and online learning environments for entrepreneurial students.","Bozward, D.; Rogers-Draycott, M.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of components of the complete blood count in comparison with C-reactive protein (CRP) to predict SBI among febrile infants. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary emergency department between December 2018 and November 2019. PATIENTS: We included febrile infants ≤3 months old with complete blood count results. We analysed their white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil ratio (ANC), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to platelet count ratio, and compared these to the performance of CRP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: SBIs were defined as urinary tract infection, bacteraemia, bacterial meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infection, bacterial enteritis, septic arthritis or osteomyelitis. RESULTS: Of the 187 infants analysed, 54 (28.9%) were diagnosed with SBI. Median values of WBC, ANC, NLR and CRP were significantly higher in infants with SBI: WBC (13.8 vs 11.4×10(9)/L, p=0.004), ANC (6.7 vs 4.1×10(9)/L, p<0.001), NLR (1.3 vs 0.9, p=0.001) and CRP (21.0 vs 2.3 mg/L, p<0.001), compared with those without. CRP had the best discriminatory values for SBI, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.815 (95% CI 0.747 to 0.883), compared with WBC, ANC and NLR. A predictive model consisting of WBC, ANC and NLR in combination with clinical parameters, had an AUC of 0.814 (95% CI 0.746 to 0.883). There was increased discriminative performance when this predictive model was combined with CRP, (AUC of 0.844, 95% CI 0.782 to 0.906). CONCLUSION: In young febrile infants, CRP was the best discriminatory biomarker for SBI. WBC, ANC and NLR when used in combination have potential diagnostic utility in this population.","Chang, Serena Su Ying; Lim, Amanda Zhirui; Ong, Gene Yong-Kwang; Piragasam, Rupini; Allen, John Carson; Ng, Kee Chong; Maconochie, Ian; Chong, Shu-Ling",BMJ Paediatr Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7818843/,21

In this case report, we describe bilateral pneumothorax following an emergency tracheotomy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old woman, who was diagnosed with laryngeal carcinoma, was developed sudden respiratory distress in the ear nose throat (ENT) ward before surgery. The patient was taken to the operating room for emergency tracheotomy. After surgery, at the 5th minute of the mechanical ventilator follow-up in ICU, she developed subcutaneous emphysema on her eyes, face, neck, and chest. She was taken to re-operation. On the postoperative follow-up, bilateral pneumothorax was detected on chest X-ray and bilateral thorax tube was applied by thoracic surgeon. She was externed to ENT ward on the 3rd postoperative day. The left thorax tube was removed on the 2nd and right thorax tube was removed on the 6th postoperative day. CONCLUSION: Here, we presented a successfully managed bilateral pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema after emergency open surgical tracheotomy. If persistence reduction of SPO(2) levels after tracheotomy, pneumothorax should be kept in the mind.","Yilmaz, Fulya",Ain-Shams J Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7892707/,21

50962,"Mais ce virus, d’où vient-il ?",2021-03-29,"Although there has been extensive research on the corporate social responsibility (CSR)–performance link, full understanding is still elusive. A possible reason for this is the limited understanding of the underlying processes that affect the relationship. Grounded in institutional theory, which emphasizes the importance of micro-level intermediating processes (e.g., employees’ perceptions and attitudes) to explain a macro-level association (i.e., CSR to organizational performance), we built a moderated mediation model where: (i) organization commitment mediated the influence of CSR on organizational performance, and (ii) an employee’s prosocial motivation moderated the relationship between CSR and organizational commitment. Using three-wave time-lagged survey data obtained from 302 Korean workers, we found that organizational commitment is an important micro-level process in the CSR–performance link, and that the level of an employee’s prosocial motivation can positively moderate that link. We discuss theoretical and practical implications, along with limitations and future research directions.","Kim, Min-Jik; Kim, Byung-Jik",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8002915/,21

METHODS: A survey was developed to assess college students’ fruit and vegetable intake and recent mental health using the Eating at America's Table Food Frequency Questionnaire (EAT) and the DASS-21. The survey was administered via Qualtrics in the initial three months after lockdown began due to COVID-19 in the area. Trained researchers coded the DASS-21 for the presence and level of depression, anxiety, and stress. The EAT was used to calculate the average number of fruits and vegetables consumed daily by each student by calculating the total number of cups of each fruit and vegetable as counted by the USDA MyPlate tool. Pearson's correlations were run between the average daily number of fruits and vegetables consumed and the severity score for depression, anxiety, and stress to determine whether relationships existed between the variables of interest. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-six students responded to the survey. Students were an average of 21.7 years of age (std dev. 4.4 years), mostly female (54.7%), freshmen (30.1%), who were enrolled full-time (69.3%). Most students identified as single (65.2%), and not in a relationship (35.6%), and as living off-campus (34.8%). Pearson's correlations revealed a slight relationship between average daily number of fruits and average daily number of vegetables consumed (r = 0.374, P < 0.01). There was no significant relationship between either fruit or vegetable consumption and any of the mental health variables. There was, however, a moderate to strong relationship between depression and anxiety (r = 0.480, P < 0.01) or stress (r = 0.686, P < 0.01) and anxiety and stress (r = 0.627, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: College students’ mental health at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown was not related to their daily fruit and vegetable intake.

54871,Cell and Gene Therapy for Anemia: Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Gene Editing,2021-06-10,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and higher proteinuria are the most sensitive predictor of the development of progressive renal insufficiency in various glomerular diseases. On the other hand, the onset of idiopathic membranous nephropathy (iMN) shows insidious progression, and the prognosis varies significantly. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the renal outcome in MN, using only the severity of proteinuria. Fractional excretion of total protein (FETP), which was protein clearance divided by creatinine clearance (Ccr), may be a better indicator of protein leak per functioning nephron. A recent study has also reported that FETP accurately predicted transplant failure and was more sensitive and specific than protein creatine ratio (PCR). Few studies, however, have analyzed the FETP to evaluate their relationship with renal function and histologic lesions in glomerular diseases. Thus, this study aims to assess the relationship between FETP and the clinicopathological findings and whether FETP predicts outcome in iMN. METHOD: This study included patients with iMN that underwent kidney biopsies during the period from 2002 to 2020. We analyzed 24-h urinary protein excretion, FETP, and other clinicopathological findings at the kidney biopsy. The FETP was determined by the standard clearance technique based on 24-h urine collection: FETP = (urinary total protein / serum total protein) / (urinary creatinine / serum creatinine) × 100. A 30% decrease in eGFR or the occurrence of ESRD were the endpoints. The multivariate factors affecting the prognosis were analyzed with the Cox proportional-hazards model, and the cumulative risk of risk factors was analyzed by Kaplan‑Meier curve. RESULTS: A total of 153 subjects with MN were identified and were followed up for a median of 5.4 years. (age 64.9±13.6 [mean ± SD] years, male 73.2 %, hypertension 42.5 %, diabetes 10.5 %, nephrotic Syndrome 67.3 %, chronic kidney disease [CKD: eGFR<60ml/min/1.73m(2)] 51.9 %, eGFR 61.6±22.6 mL/min/1.73m(2), urinary protein excretion [u-TP] 4.3±3.6 g/day, PCR 5.4±4.5 g/gCr, FETP 0.12±0.18 %, Selectivity Index [S.I] 0.23±0.39, fractional excretion of IgG [FEIgG] 0.065±0.170 %, glomerulosclerosis [GS] 13.9±13.7 %, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy [IFTA] 12.2±10.0 %). FETP was more significantly associated with clinical parameters than PCR and FEIgG (Table.1). The high FETP group had a significantly worse renal prognosis during the follow-up periods than the low FETP group (Figure.1). Using Cox proportional hazards models, with FETP entered, and age, sex, eGFR,u-TP as covariates, FETP predict the primary endpoint with a hazards ratio of 0.343 (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that FETP would be superior to PCR, the standard measure of proteinuria, in predicting outcome in patients with iMN. FETP could indicate the increased glomerular protein permeability and decreased glomerular filtration function in iMN.","Kuno, Hideaki; Kanzaki, Go; Oba, Rina; Hatanaka, Saeko; Sasaki, Takaya; Okabayashi, Yusuke; Haruhara, Kotaro; Koike, Kentaro; Tsuboi, Nobuo; Yokoo, Takashi",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8218200/,21

Despite the potential benefits of SP, the effectiveness of this complex intervention remains uncertain. This paper presents the study protocol of the evaluation of the first SP project in Portugal. METHODS: A mixed-methods study will be conducted to evaluate the SP project. For the quantitative component, a longitudinal, prospective study with a pre-post design will be performed. Data on patients referred to SP will be collected in four different points in time throughout the intervention, using questionnaires on patients’ health status and sociodemographic characteristics, and scales on patients’ well-being, quality of life and activation. The secondary data will be collected using patients’ medical records and SP’s forms about the referral and social responses elaborated within the intervention. Semi-structured interviews with patients and focus groups with stakeholders will be conducted to assess experiences of participation and improvement suggestions on SP. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive and complementary evidence will provide insights and learning for the implementation of future SP interventions.

Despite the creation of additional institutional incentives, the adoption of special programs at the state level and joining of two subjects to the Far Eastern Federal District in 2018, the parameters of sociodemographic dynamics in the macroregion remain lower than expected. Based on an analysis of indicators of natural population movement and migration, household income and expenditures, quality of life in all 11 federal subjects of the Far Eastern Federal District, trends, and achieved results of “indirect institutional incentives” are demonstrated. The authors conclude that after 30 years of reforms aimed at improving the level and quality of life of the population in Russia and creating comfortable living conditions in the Far East, the factors hindering these processes remain unchanged. Consequently, failures in stabilizing the demographic potential and developing the social system in the Far East are mainly due to incorrect emphasis of state policy on “institutional regulation” in this area, i.e., failure of the institutional paradigm to achieve the policy goal.","Minakir, P.

FV3’s large genome (~105 kb) contains at least 98 putative open reading frames (ORFs) as annotated in its reference genome. Previous studies have classified these coding genes into temporal classes as immediate early, delayed early, and late viral transcripts based on their sequential expression during FV3 infection. To establish a high-throughput characterization of ranaviral gene expression at the genome scale, we performed a whole transcriptomic analysis (RNA-Seq) using total RNA samples containing both viral and cellular transcripts from FV3-infected Xenopus laevis adult tissues using two FV3 strains, a wild type (FV3-WT) and an ORF64R-deleted recombinant (FV3-∆64R). In samples from the infected intestine, liver, spleen, lung, and especially kidney, an FV3-targeted transcriptomic analysis mapped reads spanning the full-genome coverage at ~10× depth on both positive and negative strands. By contrast, reads were only mapped to partial genomic regions in samples from the infected thymus, skin, and muscle. Extensive analyses validated the expression of almost all of the 98 annotated ORFs and profiled their differential expression in a tissue-, virus-, and temporal class-dependent manner. Further studies identified several putative ORFs that encode hypothetical proteins containing viral mimicking conserved domains found in host interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) and IFN receptors. This study provides the first comprehensive genome-wide viral transcriptome profiling during infection and across multiple amphibian host tissues that will serve as an instrumental reference. Our findings imply that Ranaviruses like FV3 have acquired previously unknown molecular mimics, interfering with host IFN signaling during evolution.","Tian, Yun; De Jesús Andino, Francisco; Khwatenge, Collins N.; Li, Jiuyi; Robert, Jacques; Sang, Yongming",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8309979/,21
56467,"Osthole: an overview of its sources, biological activities, and modification development",2021-08-05,"INTRODUCTION: Critically ill patients are predisposed to developing sleep disorders due to multiple factors like pre-existing sleep disorders, severe acute illness, sleep-altering medical interventions, and the disturbing intensive care unit (ICU) environment. In the current study, a multi-modality approach has been attempted to capture the different aspects of sleep disturbances, including insomnia (using ISI), daytime sleepiness (using ESS), sleep quality (using PSQI), sleep architecture, and SDB (using PSG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The eligible ARDS survivor patients were updated about the study's design prior to hospital discharge. At admission, data regarding demographic details, clinical history, etiology of ARDS, and PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio at presentation, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores was collected. All enrolled patients were evaluated twice (early-within 7 days of admission and late-after 6 weeks of discharge) by the Richards–Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ), Insomnia severity index (ISI), and level 1 PSG. Additionally, ESS questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were also recorded in late evaluation. Abnormal sleep was defined if one or more of the following characteristics met: ISI > 15, ESS > 10, global PSQI > 5, AHI ≥ 5 events/h. RESULTS: Thirty patients were recruited out of the total of 88 ARDS patients screened at admission. The median (IQR) PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio and APACHE II scores were 176 (151–191.5) and 14 (14–16), respectively. The median (IQR) duration of stay in the ICU was 10 (7.3–19.5) days. The median RCSQ score in the early and late evaluation was 42 and 69, respectively. The mean ISI score in the early evaluation was 16.67 ± 4.72, which decreased to 11.70 ± 5.03 in late evaluation (p < 0.05). ISI score > 15 (clinical insomnia) was found in 18 out of 30 subjects (60%) in early evaluation and 11 out of 30 (36%) in late evaluation. During the early evaluation, sleep efficiency was low (median 59.9% and predominantly N1 and N2) which improved in late evaluation (median 80.6%). Of the 30 patients, only 4 had AHI > 5 in early evaluation and none in late evaluation. Neither of P/F ratio, SOFA, and APACHE II scores did correlate with ICU events in the early and late evaluations. Regression analysis showed subjects with ICU stay more than 10 days, duration of IMV more than 7 days, Fentanyl more than 7 mg, duration of sedative use more than 7 days was independently associated with poor objective sleep quality (low sleep efficiency, low TST and high arousal index) during the early and late evaluations after ICU discharge compared to counterparts (p value < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude that sleep quality in ARDS survivors was poor within 7 days of ICU discharge, characterized by severe disruption of sleep architecture and sleep-disordered breathing. After 6 weeks of ICU discharge sleep quality showed significant improvement in the N3 stage and AHI, however persistent insomnia was observed even at 6 weeks. Therefore, prior identification of risk factors and early diagnosis of sleep quality disorders in post-ARDS patients is essential.","Srikanth, Juvva Kishan; Kumar, Rohit; Gupta, Neeraj Kumar; Ish, Pranav; Yadav, Siddharth Raj; Chakrabarti, Shibdas; Gupta, Nitesh",Sleep Vigil,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8324182/,21

60384,Partial Sequence of a Novel Virus Isolated from Pelodiscus sinensis Hemorrhagic Disease.,2015,"OBJECTIVE Utilizing a standard framework that may help clinicians and patients identify relevant mental health apps, we sought to gain a comprehensive picture of the space by searching for, downloading, and reviewing 278 mental health apps from both the iOS and Android stores. METHODS 278 mental health apps from the Apple iOS store and Google Play store were downloaded and reviewed in a standardized manner by trained app raters using a validated framework. Apps were evaluated with this framework comprising 105 questions and covering app origin and accessibility, privacy and security, inputs and outputs, clinical foundation, features and engagement style, and interoperability. RESULTS Our results confirm that app stars and downloads - even for the most popular apps by these metrics - did not correlate with more clinically relevant metrics related to privacy/security, effectiveness, and engagement. Most mental health apps offer similar functionality, with 16.5% offering both mood tracking and journaling and 7% offering psychoeducation, deep breathing, mindfulness, journaling, and mood tracking. Only 36.4% of apps were updated with a 100-day window, and 7.5% of apps had not been updated in four years. CONCLUSION Current app marketplace metrics commonly used to evaluate apps do not offer an accurate representation of individual apps or a comprehensive overview of the entire space. The majority of apps overlap in terms of features offered, with many domains and other features not well represented. Selecting an appropriate app continues to require personal matching given no clear trends or guidance offered by quantitative metrics alone.","Lagan, Sarah; D'Mello, Ryan; Vaidyam, Aditya; Bilden, Rebecca; Torous, John",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.13306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33835483/,21
60386,Feline Calicivirus Proteinase-Polymerase Degrades mRNAs to Inhibit Host Gene Expression.,2021-04-14,"OBJECTIVE A novel type of Coronavirus was identified in China in December 2019. The first cases of a form of pneumonia of unknown etiology were detected at the beginning of that month in Wuhan. The virus is believed to have emerged at the Wuhan Huanan Seafood Market, where transmission of a zoonotic pathogen to humans occurred. PATIENTS AND METHODS Some studies conducted in China during the epidemic report small numbers of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 and some pregnancy complications in patients with COVID-19. However, they fail to document the transplacental passage of the virus from mother to fetus. RESULTS Following the COVID-19 outbreak, guidelines for couples who are undergoing treatments of assisted reproduction have been issued by the International Federation for Fertility Societies (IFFS), the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the Latin American Network of Assisted Reproduction (REDLARA). They recommend couples to discuss assisted reproduction with their doctors while those at risk or with SARS-CoV-2 should consider freezing oocytes or embryos and retransferring them later. CONCLUSIONS Other than the US, Italy is the country with the highest number of cases (197675 positives, 26644 deaths) (updated on April 26). The Italian National Transplant Centre and the Higher Institute of Health advised on March 17 to complete the cycles already started and not to start new cycles. Phase 2 will begin on 4 May with an increase in freedom of action and fertilization treatments will start again. The Society that brings together embryologists (SIERR) has issued the guidelines to be followed when this happens.","Pasquale, C; Montanino Oliva, M; Benedetti, M; Berlinghieri, V; Bielli, W; Buonomo, G; Carfagna, P; Costantino, A; Cristofano, D; Iacomino, D; Lippa, A; Lisi, R; Ortensi, I; Quinzi, A; Giorlandino, C; Lisi, F",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202007_21924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32706092/,21

60703,"Novel lipophilic hydroxyurea derivatives: synthesis, cytostatic and antiviral activity evaluations.",2008,"BACKGROUND Maintenance of central blood volume (CBV) is essential for hemodynamic stability during hemodialysis (HD), though preservation of CBV is poorly understood. Pneumatic compression devices (PCDs) during HD may help maintain CBV. METHODS We performed a randomized, crossover trial to determine the effect of PCDs on CBV during HD. Patients underwent two consecutive mid-week HD sessions, randomized to begin the first session either with or without PCDs [stratified by intradialytic hypotension (IDH)-prone status]. The primary outcome was change in CBV during HD. The secondary outcomes were change in other hemodynamic and volume status parameters. RESULTS Fifty-one patients (median age 65 years, 75% male, 22% IDH-prone) were randomized; forty-six completed the study. During HD, the median change in CBV for PCD and control sessions was -0.08 versus -0.05 L (P = 0.62). There was no difference in the change in cardiac output (CO) (-0.63 versus -0.49 L/min, P = 0.78) or systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (+1.30 versus +1.55 mmHg/L/min, P = 0.67) for PCDs versus control. Based on the bioimpedance measurements, patients were not volume overloaded pre-dialysis. There was a greater reduction in total body water (TBW) (-2.6 versus -2.3 L, P = 0.05) and intracellular fluid (ICF) volume (-1.3 versus -1.1 L, P = 0.03), and no difference in change in the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume (1.3 versus 1.2 L, P = 0.09) with PCDs versus control. Similar results were observed in IDH-prone patients. CONCLUSIONS Compared with standard of care, PCDs have no effect on intradialytic hemodynamic parameters, including CBV, although they may allow greater capacity for fluid removal. Further studies are required to better understand physiological and hemodynamic changes in patients during HD.","Tai, Davina J; Ahmed, Sofia B; Palacios-Derflingher, Luz; Hemmelgarn, Brenda R; MacRae, Jennifer M","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfs502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23136215/,21
61024,Multiscale Feedback Loops in SARS-CoV-2 Viral Evolution.,2020-12-01,"Embryonated eggs are the infectious developmental stage of Trichuris trichiura and are the primary stimulus for the immune system of the definitive host. The intestinal-dwelling T. trichiura affects an estimated 465 million people worldwide with an estimated global burden of disease of 640 000 DALYs (Disability Adjusted Life Years). In Latin America and the Caribbean, trichuriasis is the most prevalent soil transmitted helminthiasis in the region (12.3%; 95% CI). The adverse health consequences impair childhood school performance and reduce school attendance resulting in lower future wage-earning capacity. The accumulation of the long-term effects translates into poverty promoting sequelae and a cycle of impoverishment. Each infective T. trichiura egg carries the antigens needed to face the immune system with a wide variety of proteins present in the shell, larvae's surface, and the accompanying fluid that contains their excretions/secretions. We used a proteomic approach with tandem mass spectrometry to investigate the proteome of soluble non-embryonated egg extracts of T. trichiura obtained from naturally infected African green monkeys (Chlorocebus sabaeus). A total of 231 proteins were identified, 168 of them with known molecular functions. The proteome revealed common proteins families which are known to play roles in energy and metabolism; the cytoskeleton, muscle and motility; proteolysis; signaling; the stress response and detoxification; transcription and translation; and lipid binding and transport. In addition to the study of the T. trichiura non-embryonated egg proteome, the antigenic profile of the T. trichiura non-embryonated egg and female soluble proteins against serum antibodies from C. sabaeus naturally infected with trichuriasis was investigated. We used an immunoproteomic approach by Western blot and tandem mass spectrometry from the corresponding SDS-PAGE gels. Vitellogenin N and VWD and DUF1943 domain containing protein, poly-cysteine and histidine tailed protein isoform 2, heat shock protein 70, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, actin, and enolase, were among the potential immunoactive proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the T. trichiura non-embryonated egg proteome as a novel source of information on potential targets for immunodiagnostics and immunomodulators from a neglected tropical disease. This initial list of T. trichiura non-embryonated egg proteins (proteome and antigenic profile) can be used in future research on the immunobiology and pathogenesis of human trichuriasis and the treatment of human intestinal immune-related diseases.","Cruz, Katalina; Marcilla, Antonio; Kelly, Patrick; Vandenplas, Michel; Osuna, Antonio; Trelis, María",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33760829/,21

61892,Virus infection cycle events coupled to RNA replication.,2014,"Theoretical models explaining serial order processing link order information to specified position markers. However, the precise characteristics of position marking have remained largely elusive. Recent studies have shown that space is involved in marking serial position of items in verbal working memory (WM). Furthermore, it has been suggested, but not proven, that accessing these items involves horizontal shifts of spatial attention. We used continuous electroencephalography recordings to show that memory search in serial order verbal WM involves spatial attention processes that share the same electrophysiological signatures as those operating on the visuospatial WM and external space. Accessing an item from a sequence in verbal WM induced posterior ""early directing attention negativity"" and ""anterior directing attention negativity"" contralateral to the position of the item in mental space (i.e., begin items on the left; end items on the right). In the frequency domain, we observed posterior alpha suppression contralateral to the position of the item. Our results provide clear evidence for the involvement of spatial attention in retrieving serial information from verbal WM. Implications for WM models are discussed.","Rasoulzadeh, Vesal; Sahan, Muhammet Ikbal; van Dijck, Jean-Philippe; Abrahamse, Elger; Marzecova, Anna; Verguts, Tom; Fias, Wim",Cerebral cortex,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305807/,21

METHODS Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat high-sugar (HFHS) diet for 8 weeks to induce obesity. After the first 8 weeks, TM5441 was added to the diet for an additional 8 weeks. In order to determine the efficacy of PAI-1 inhibition in conjunction with dietary modification, mice were fed an HFHS diet for 8 weeks to induce obesity and were then switched to a low-fat diet with or without TM5441 for an additional 2 to 8 weeks. RESULTS Obese mice showed weight reduction and significant improvement in hepatic steatosis when TM5441 was added to the HFHS diet. Obese mice that were treated with TM5441 in conjunction with dietary modification showed enhanced weight loss and a more rapid reversal of hepatic steatosis compared with obese mice treated with dietary modification alone. The enhanced weight loss among mice treated with TM5441 was associated with increased adipose tissue expression of adipose triglyceride lipase, phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase, and phosphorylated perilipin-1 as well as induction of adipose tissue lipolysis. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacologic PAI-1 inhibition stimulates adipose tissue lipolysis and enhances weight loss in obese mice.","Levine, Joshua A; Olivares, Shantel; Miyata, Toshio; Vaughan, Douglas E; Henkel, Anne S",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594826/,21
62140,Molecular basis of the lipid-induced MucA-MucB dissociation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,2020-08-03,"BACKGROUND Treatment for claudication that is due to aortoiliac peripheral artery disease (PAD) often relies on stent revascularization (ST). However, supervised exercise (SE) is known to provide comparable short-term (6-month) improvements in functional status and quality of life. Longer-term outcomes are not known. OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to report the longer-term (18-month) efficacy of SE compared with ST and optimal medical care (OMC). METHODS Of 111 patients with aortoiliac PAD randomly assigned to receive OMC, OMC plus SE, or OMC plus ST, 79 completed the 18-month clinical and treadmill follow-up assessment. SE consisted of 6 months of SE and an additional year of telephone-based exercise counseling. Primary clinical outcomes included objective treadmill-based walking performance and subjective quality of life. RESULTS Peak walking time improved from baseline to 18 months for both SE (5.0 ± 5.4 min) and ST (3.2 ± 4.7 min) significantly more than for OMC (0.2 ± 2.1 min; p < 0.001 and p = 0.04, respectively). The difference between SE and ST was not significant (p = 0.16). Improvement in claudication onset time was greater for SE compared with OMC, but not for ST compared with OMC. Many disease-specific quality-of-life scales demonstrated durable improvements that were greater for ST compared with SE or OMC. CONCLUSIONS Both SE and ST had better 18-month outcomes than OMC. SE and ST provided comparable durable improvement in functional status and in quality of life up to 18 months. The durability of claudication exercise interventions merits its consideration as a primary PAD claudication treatment.","Murphy, Timothy P; Cutlip, Donald E; Regensteiner, Judith G; Mohler, Emile R; Cohen, David J; Reynolds, Matthew R; Massaro, Joseph M; Lewis, Beth A; Cerezo, Joselyn; Oldenburg, Niki C; Thum, Claudia C; Jaff, Michael R; Comerota, Anthony J; Steffes, Michael W; Abrahamsen, Ingrid H; Goldberg, Suzanne; Hirsch, Alan T",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2014.12.043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25766947/,21

Conventional anti-cancer agents are losing their efficiency which highlights the need to introduce new anti-cancer entities for treating this complex disease. A hybrid molecule has a tendency to act through varied modes of action on multiple targets at a given time. Thus, there is the significant scope with hybrid compounds to tackle the existing limitations of cancer chemotherapy. AREA COVERED This perspective describes the most significant hybrids that spring hope in the field of cancer chemotherapy. Several hybrids with anti-proliferative/anti-tumor properties currently approved or in clinical development are outlined, along with a description of their mechanism of action and identified drug targets. EXPERT OPINION The success of molecular hybridization in cancer chemotherapy is quite evident by the number of molecules entering into clinical trials and/or have entered the drug market over the past decade. Indeed, the recent advancements and co-ordinations in the interface between chemistry, biology and pharmacology will help further the advancement of hybrid chemotherapeutics in the future.","Shalini,; Kumar, Vipan",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2021.1850686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305635/,21

Previous improvement work has been targeted at this care transition, but gaps in discharge communication still exist. We aimed to increase documentation of 2-way communication between hospitalists and primary care providers (PCPs) for high-risk discharges from pediatric hospital medicine (PHM) services from 7% to 60% within 30 months. METHODS A3 improvement methodology was used. A list of high-risk discharge communication criteria was developed through engagement of PCPs and hospitalists. A driver diagram guided interventions. The outcome measure was documentation of successful 2-way communication with the PCP. Any documented 2-way discharge communication attempt was the process measure. Via a survey, hospitalist satisfaction with the discharge communication expectation served as the balancing measure. All patients discharged from PHM services meeting ≥1 high-risk criterion were included. Statistical process control charts were used to assess changes over time. RESULTS There were 3241 high-risk discharges (442 baseline: November 2017 to January 2018; 2799 intervention and sustain: February 2018 to June 2020). The outcome measure displayed iterative special cause variation from a mean baseline of 7% to peak of 39% but regressed and was sustained at 27%. The process measure displayed iterative special cause variation from a 13% baseline mean to a 64% peak, with regression to 41%. The balancing measure worsened from baseline of 5% dissatisfaction to 13%. Interventions temporally related to special cause improvements were education, division-level performance feedback, standardization of documentation, and offloading the task of communication coordination from hospitalists to support staff. CONCLUSIONS Improvement methodology resulted in modestly sustained improvements in PCP communication for high-risk discharges from the PHM services.","Clark, Nicholas A; Simmons, Julia; Etzenhouser, Angela; Pallotto, Eugenia K",Hospital pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/hpeds.2020-005421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34526327/,21

Studies comparing robotic pancreaticogastrostomy (PG) and pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) are scarcely reported. METHODS The present study analyzes the outcomes of two case-matched groups of patients who underwent PG (n = 20) or PJ (n = 40) after pancreaticoduodenectomy. The primary aim was to compare the rate of post-operative pancreatic fistula. RESULTS Operative time (375 vs. 315 min, p = 0.34), estimated blood loss (270 vs. 295 mL, p = 0.44), and rate of clinically relevant post-operative pancreatic fistula (12.5% vs. 10%, p = 0.82) were similar between the two groups. PJ was associated with a higher rate of intra-abdominal collections (7.5% vs. 0%, p = 0.002), but lower post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage (2.5% vs. 10%, p = 0.003). PG was associated with a lower rate of post-operative pancreatic fistula (POPF) (33.3% vs. 50%, p = 0.003) in the high-risk group of patients. CONCLUSIONS The outcomes of post-operative pancreatic fistula are comparable between the two reconstruction techniques.

65190,Metagenomic analysis of the viromes of three North American bat species: viral diversity among different bat species that share a common habitat.,2010,"BACKGROUND Recommendations regarding ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are based on a low level of scientific evidence. We hypothesized that practices about ventilation during CPR might be heterogeneous and may differ worldwide. To address this question, we surveyed physicians from several countries on their practices during CPR. METHODS We used a Web-based opinion survey. Links to the survey were sent by e-mail newsletters and displayed on the Web sites of medical societies involved in CPR practice from December 2013 to March 2014. RESULTS 1,328 surveys were opened, and 548 were completed (41%). Responses came from 54 countries, but 64% came from 6 countries. Responders were mostly physicians (89%). From this group, 97% declared following specific CPR guidelines. Regarding practices, 28% declared always or frequently adopting only continuous chest compressions without additional ventilation. With regard to mechanical chest compression devices, 38% responded that such devices were available to them; when used, 28% declared always or frequently experiencing problems with ventilation such as frequent alarms. During bag-mask ventilation in intubated patients, 18% declared stopping chest compression during insufflation, and 39% applied > 10 breaths/min, which conflicts with international CPR guidelines. When a ventilator was used, the volume controlled mode was the most common strategy cited, but there was heterogeneity regarding ventilator settings for PEEP, trigger, FIO2 , and breathing frequency. SpO2 and end-tidal CO2 were the 2 most monitored variables cited. CONCLUSIONS Physicians indicated heterogeneous practices that often differ significantly from international CPR guidelines. This may reflect the low level of evidence and a lack of detailed recommendations concerning ventilation during CPR.","Cordioli, Ricardo Luiz; Brochard, Laurent; Suppan, Laurent; Lyazidi, Aissam; Templier, François; Khoury, Abdo; Delisle, Stephane; Savary, Dominique; Richard, Jean-Christophe",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.05964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29739857/,21
65434,Utilization of Capsules for Negative Staining of Viral Samples within Biocontainment.,2017,"BACKGROUND Previous RCTs have failed to demonstrate the usefulness of combining energy devices with the conventional clamp crushing method to reduce blood loss during liver transection. Here, the combination of an ultrasonically activated device (UAD) and a bipolar vessel-sealing device (BVSD) with crush clamping was investigated. METHODS Patients scheduled to undergo hepatectomy at the University of Tokyo Hospital or Nihon University Itabashi Hospital were eligible for this parallel-group, single-blinded randomized study. Patients were assigned to a control group (no energy device used), an UAD group or a BVSD group. The primary endpoint was the volume of blood loss during liver transection. Outcomes of the control group and the combined energy device groups (UAD plus BVSD) were first compared. Pairwise comparisons among the three groups were made for outcomes for which the combined energy device group was superior to the control group. RESULTS A total of 380 patients were enrolled between July 2012 and May 2014; 116 patients in the control group, 122 in the UAD group and 123 in the BVSD group were included in the final analysis. Median blood loss during liver transection was lower in the combined energy device group (245 patients) than in the control group (116 patients): median 190 (range 0-3575) versus 230 (range 3-1570) ml (P = 0·048). Pairwise comparison revealed that blood loss was lower in the BVSD group than in the control group (P = 0·043).

We examined how the pandemic and its social consequences may differentially impact sexual minority adults, relative to heterosexual adults. Methods: Data are from a U.S. national sample of adults (n = 2996; 18.06%) collected from online panels from April to May 2020. We used eight indicators of well-being-mental health, physical health, quality of life, stress, loneliness, psychological distress, alcohol use, and fatigue-to assess the degree to which sexual identity subgroups (i.e., heterosexual, gay/lesbian, bisexual, and ""other"" sexual minority) varied in retrospective pre- and postpandemic onset indicators of well-being and whether groups varied in their rate of change from pre- and postpandemic onset. Results: The results showed consistent patterns of decline in well-being across sexual identity subgroups, although changes in mental health, physical health, quality of life, stress, and psychological distress were more robust among sexual minority adults in general, relative to heterosexual adults. Adjusted multivariate models testing differences in change in retrospective pre- and postpandemic onset found that well-being among bisexual men and women was most negatively impacted by the pandemic. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic may have distinct health consequences for sexual minority adults in the United States. Our findings support and further legitimize calls for more comprehensive surveillance and cultural responsiveness in emergency preparedness as it relates to sexual minority people and the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fish, Jessica N; Salerno, John; Williams, Natasha D; Rinderknecht, R Gordon; Drotning, Kelsey J; Sayer, Liana; Doan, Long",LGBT health,https://doi.org/10.1089/lgbt.2020.0489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33887160/,21

In period 1, forced arterial suction thrombectomy with a Penumbra reperfusion catheter was performed, even in difficult cases; in period 2, forced arterial suction thrombectomy was initially performed, with switching to Solitaire in difficult cases. METHODS We analyzed 135 consecutive patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy with acute large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation, 61 from period 1 and 74 from period 2. We defined difficult case for both periods as ≥3 failed attempts at recanalization. RESULTS Period 2 showed a trend for better angiographic outcome of Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b-3 (73.8%, period 1 versus 85.1%, period 2; P=0.10). In interperiod subgroup analysis of difficult cases, switching significantly outperformed nonswitching in Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b-3 recanalization (52.7% versus 82.9%; P=0.030). Differences in puncture-to-recanalization time, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage incidence, and procedure-related complications were not statistically significant.

In the near future, it will be crucial to identify facilities capable of providing health care in compliance with the safety of healthcare professionals, administrative staff and patients. All the staff involved in the project of a Covid-free hospital should be subjected to a diagnostic swab for COVID-19 before the beginning of healthcare activity and then periodically in order to avoid the risk of contamination of patients during the process of care. The modifications of various activities involved in the process of care are described: outpatient care, reception of inpatients, inpatient ward and operating room. For outpatient care, modality of appointment procedure, characteristics of waiting room and personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare professionals and administrative staff are presented. Reception of inpatients shall be conditional on a negative swab for COVID-19 obtained with a drive-in procedure. The management of the operating room represents the most crucial step of the patient's care process. The surgical team should be restricted and monitored with periodic swabs; surgical procedures should be performed by experienced surgeons according to standard procedures; surgical training experimental treatments and research protocols should be suspended. Adequate personal protective equipment and measures to reduce aerosolization in the operating room (closed circuits, continuous cycle insufflators, fume extraction) should be adopted. Prevention of possible transmission of the virus during procedures in open, laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery is to use a multi-tactic approach, which includes correct filtration and ventilation of the operating room, the use of appropriate PPE (FFP3 plus surgical mask and protective visor for all the staff working in the operating room) and smoke evacuation devices with a suction and filter system. on behalf of the UrOP Executive Committee Giuseppe Ludovico, Angelo Cafarelli, Ottavio De Cobelli, Ferdinando De Marco, Giovanni Ferrari, Stefano Pecoraro, Angelo Porreca, Domenico Tuzzolo.","Leonardi, Rosario; Bellinzoni, Piera; Broglia, Luigi; Colombo, Renzo; De Marchi, Davide; Falcone, Lorenzo; Giusti, Guido; Grasso, Vincenzo; Mantica, Guglielmo; Passaretti, Giovanni; Proietti, Silvia; Russo, Antonio; Saitta, Giuseppe; Smelzo, Salvatore; Suardi, Nazareno; Gaboardi, Franco","Archivio italiano di urologia, andrologia : organo ufficiale [di] Societa italiana di ecografia urologica e nefrologica",https://doi.org/10.4081/aiua.2020.2.67; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32597101/,21

68977,Yeast as a model host to explore plant virus-host interactions.,2008,"Background The first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case was reported in Canada on January 25, 2020. In response to the imminent outbreak, many provincial and territorial health authorities implemented nonpharmaceutical public health measures to curb the spread of disease. ""Social distancing"" measures included restrictions on group gatherings; cancellation of sports, cultural and religious events and gatherings; recommended physical distancing between people; school and daycare closures; reductions in non-essential services; and closures of businesses. Objectives To evaluate the impact of the combined nonpharmaceutical interventions imposed in March 2020 on influenza A and B epidemiology by comparing national laboratory surveillance data from the intervention period with 9-year historical influenza season control data. Methods We obtained epidemiologic data on laboratory influenza A and B detections and test volumes from the Canadian national influenza surveillance system for the epidemiologic period December 29, 2019 (epidemiologic week 1) through May 2, 2020 (epidemiologic week 18). COVID-19-related social distancing measures were implemented in Canada from epidemiologic week 10 of this period. We compared influenza A and B laboratory detections and test volumes and trends in detection during the 2019-20 influenza season with those of the previous nine influenza seasons for evidence of changes in epidemiologic trends. Results While influenza detections the week prior to the implementation of social distancing measures did not differ statistically from the previous nine seasons, a steep decline in positivity occurred between epidemiologic weeks 10 and 14 (March 8-April 4, 2020). Both the percent positive on week 14 (p≤0.001) and rate of decline between weeks 10 and 14 (p=0.003) were significantly different from mean historical data. Conclusion The data show a dramatic decrease in influenza A and B laboratory detections concurrent with social distancing measures and nonpharmaceutical interventions in Canada. The impact of these measures on influenza transmission may be generalizable to other respiratory viral illnesses during the study period, including COVID-19.","Lagacé-Wiens, Philippe; Sevenhuysen, Claire; Lee, Liza; Nwosu, Andrea; Smith, Tiffany",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://doi.org/10.14745/ccdr.v47i03a04; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34012338/,21

71309,"Comparative Genomics Underlines Multiple Roles of Profftella, an Obligate Symbiont of Psyllids: Providing Toxins, Vitamins, and Carotenoids.",2020-08-14,"Personalized and precision nutrition aim to examine and improve health on an individual level, and this requires reconsideration of traditional dietary interventions or behavioral study designs. The limited frequency of measurements in group-level human nutrition trials cannot be used to infer individual responses to interventions, while in behavioral studies, retrospective data collection does not provide an accurate measure of how everyday behaviors affect individual health. This review introduces the concept of N-of-1 study designs, which involve the repeated measurement of a health outcome or behavior on an individual level. Observational designs can be used to monitor a participant's usual health or behavior in a naturalistic setting, with repeated measurements conducted in real time using an Ecological Momentary Assessment. Interventional designs can introduce a dietary or behavioral intervention with predictors and outcomes of interest measured repeatedly either during or after 1 or more intervention and control periods. Due to their flexibility, N-of-1 designs can be applied to both short-term physiological studies and longer-term studies of eating behaviors. As a growing number of disease markers can be measured outside of the clinic, with self-reported data delivered via electronic devices, it is now easier than ever to generate large amounts of data on an individual level. Statistical techniques can be utilized to analyze changes in an individual or to aggregate data from sets of N-of-1 trials, enabling hypotheses to be tested on a small number of heterogeneous individuals. Although their designs necessitate extra methodological and statistical considerations, N-of-1 studies could be used to investigate complex research questions and to study underrepresented groups. This may help to reveal novel associations between participant characteristics and health outcomes, with repeated measures providing power and precision to accurately determine an individual's health status.","Potter, Tilly; Vieira, Rute; de Roos, Baukje",Advances in nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmaa173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33460438/,21
71392,Variation of the response to metal ions and Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay across different Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetic backgrounds.,2021-05-06,"PURPOSE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread rapidly worldwide, causing a severe outbreak. Because the disease is easily transmitted, face masks are a vital tool to slow the spread. The aim of this study is to investigate the impacts of face mask use on standard automated perimetry (SAP) results in glaucoma patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS All follow-up glaucoma patients who underwent SAP between May and October 2020 were enrolled in this study. In patients with low test reliability and/or visual field changes, SAP was repeated after repositioning and taping patients' face masks. RESULTS A total of 127 patients (59 female and 68 male) with a mean age of 59.8±10.3 years were included in the study. While 101 patients (79.5%) wore surgical face masks, 26 patients (20.5%) wore cloth face masks. Low SAP reliability appeared in 23 patients (18.1%), and inferior visual field defects were present in 3 patients (2.4%). The main effects of poorly-fitting face masks on SAP reliability were increased fixation losses and false-positive errors (for both, P=0.001). Low SAP reliability was significantly higher in patients wearing cloth face masks than in those wearing surgical face masks (47.8% vs. 9.9%; P=0.0001). The face mask-related fogging of eyeglasses before SAP is a strong predictor of fogging of the trial lenses-related low SAP reliability (odds ratio: 27, 95% confidence interval: 5.48-132.92, P=0.0001). In all repeated SAPs, the patients' reliability parameters improved, and inferior visual field artifacts disappeared. CONCLUSIONS Unsuitable face masks can cause either visual field artifacts, which may be interpreted as glaucoma progression or low test reliability. Taping the face masks' upper edges is an effective technique to prevent visual field artifacts and obtain good test reliability.","Bayram, Nurettin; Gundogan, Medine; Ozsaygılı, Cemal; Vural, Esra; Cicek, Ayse",Journal of glaucoma,https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33428353/,21

72162,Exploring the recent molecular targets for diabetes and associated complications.,2021-03-24,"Although surrogate measures to quantify pain intensity have been commercialised, there is a need to develop a new index with improved accuracy. The aim of this study was to develop a new analgesic index using nasal photoplethysmography data. The specially designed sensor was placed between the columella and the nasal septum to acquire nasal photoplethysmography in surgical patients. Nasal photoplethysmography and Surgical Pleth Index® (GE Healthcare) data were obtained for 14 min both in the absence (pre-operatively) or presence (postoperatively) of pain in a group of surgical patients, each patient acting as their own control. Various dynamic photoplethysmography variables were extracted to quantify pain intensity; the most accurate index was selected using logistic regression as a classifier. The area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic curve was measured to evaluate the accuracy of final model predictions. In total, 12,012 heart beats from 89 patients were used to develop a new Nasal Photoplethysmography Index for analgesic depth quantification. The two-variable model (a combination of diastolic peak point variation and heart beat interval variation) was most accurate in discriminating between the presence and absence of pain (numerical rating scale (NRS) ≥ 3). The accuracy and area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic curve for the Nasal Photoplethysmography Index were 75.3% and 0.8018, respectively, and 64.8% and 0.7034, respectively, for the Surgical Pleth Index. The Nasal Photoplethysmography Index clearly distinguished pain (NRS ≥ 3) in awake surgical patients with postoperative pain. The Nasal Photoplethysmography Index performed better than the Surgical Pleth Index. Further validation studies are needed to evaluate its feasibility to quantify pain intensity during general anaesthesia.","Choi, B M; Park, C; Lee, Y H; Shin, H; Lee, S H; Jeong, S; Noh, G J; Lee, B",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.14327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29790159/,21

METHODS We systematically searched four databases (Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE & SCOPUS) and screened articles to identify those reporting the psychometric properties (e.g. validity, reliability) and interpretability (e.g. minimal clinically important difference) of BPI-SF and SF-MPQ-2 as evaluated in pain-related musculoskeletal conditions. Independently, two reviewers extracted data and assessed the quality of evidence with a structured quality appraisal tool and the updated COSMIN guidelines. RESULTS Twenty-six articles were included (BPI-SF, n=17; SF-MPQ-2, n=9). Both tools lack reporting on their cross-cultural validities and measurement error indices (e.g. standard error of measurement). High quality studies suggest the tools are internally consistent (α=0.83-0.96), and they associate modestly with similar outcomes (r=0.3-0.69). Strong evidence suggest the BPI-SF conforms to its two-dimensional structure in MSK studies; the SF-MPQ-2 four-factor structure was not clearly established. Seven reports of high-to-moderate quality evidence were supportive of the BPI-SF known group validity (n=2) and responsiveness (n=5). One report of high quality established the SF-MPQ-2 responsiveness. DISCUSSION Evidence of high to moderate quality supports the internal consistency, criterion-convergent validity, structural validity and responsiveness of the BPI-SF and SF-MPQ-2 and establishes their use as generic multidimensional pain outcomes in musculoskeletal populations. However, more studies of high quality are still needed on their retest reliability, known group validity, cross-cultural validity, interpretability properties and measurement error indices in different MSK populations.","Jumbo, Samuel U; MacDermid, Joy C; Kalu, Michael E; Packham, Tara L; Athwal, George S; Faber, Kenneth J",The Clinical journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/ajp.0000000000000933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734148/,21
72332,"Population structure, genetic diversity and pathotypes of Streptococcus suis isolated during the last 13 years from diseased pigs in Switzerland.",2020-07-08,"BACKGROUND Capacity strengthening of primary health care workers is widely used as a means to strengthen health service delivery, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the widespread recognition of the importance of capacity strengthening to improve access to quality health care, how the term 'capacity strengthening' is both used and measured varies substantially across the literature. This scoping review sought to identify the most common domains of individual capacity strengthening, as well as their most common forms of measurement, to generate a better understanding of what is meant by the term 'capacity strengthening' for primary health care workers. METHODS Six electronic databases were searched for studies published between January 2000 and October 2020. A total of 4474 articles were screened at title and abstract phase and 323 full-text articles were reviewed. 55 articles were ultimately identified for inclusion, covering various geographic settings and health topics. RESULTS Capacity strengthening is predominantly conceptualised in relation to knowledge and skills, as either sole domains of capacity, or used in combination with other domains including self-efficacy, practices, ability, and competencies. Capacity strengthening is primarily measured using pre- and post-tests, practical evaluations, and observation. These occur along study-specific indicators, though some pre-existing, validated tools are also used. CONCLUSION The concept of capacity strengthening for primary health care workers reflected across a number of relevant frameworks and theories differs from what is commonly seen in practice. A framework of individual capacity strengthening across intra-personal, inter-personal, and technical domains is proposed, as an initial step towards building a common consensus of individual capacity strengthening for future work.","Finn, Mairéad; Gilmore, Brynne; Sheaf, Greg; Vallières, Frédérique",Human resources for health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-020-00547-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33407554/,21

73251,Going the Distance: Optimizing RNA-Seq Strategies for Transcriptomic Analysis of Complex Viral Genomes.,2019,"OBJECTIVES As the coronavirus 2019 pandemic puts strains on current models of otolaryngology practice, telemedicine is an attractive way for otolaryngologists to reduce in-person appointments while still addressing the health of their patients. This systematic review of the literature aims to identify the evidence basis for using telemedicine in otolaryngology practice to limit person-to-person interactions while achieving comparable quality to in-person services. METHODS The authors gathered articles from three databases (Embase, PubMed and Web of Science), performed a comprehensive literature review of articles published on telemedicine since 2002, and selected articles for inclusion based on their relevance to otolaryngology and the potential of the intervention to improve patient social distancing. RESULTS A total of 7153 articles were identified from the initial query. After review, 35 met the inclusion criteria. Of the included articles, 32 (91%), found their specific telemedicine intervention to be effective when compared to in-person services. Twenty articles (57%) were related to remote otoscopy. Other telemedical interventions included videoconferencing for peri-operative visits, diagnosis of peritonsillar abscess, telephone-based voice evaluations and evaluation of nasal fractures. CONCLUSIONS Video-otoscopy is the most well-supported telemedical intervention which limits physical contact between otolaryngologists and their patients. Other interventions have also demonstrated efficacy but have yet to be as widely validated as video-otoscopy. Telehealth facilitators play a key role in providing high-quality telehealth services. More invasive procedures, such as laryngoscopy, require further evidence to demonstrate definite benefits in a telemedicine setting.","Moentmann, Michael R; Miller, Ryan J; Chung, Michael T; Yoo, George H",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x20985391; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33535916/,21

Wuhan and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region implemented first-level public health emergency responses to stop the spread of the virus on January 23rd, 2020. We tracked the geographical gravity centre of the disease and calculated spatial autocorrelation to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of distribution of imported and locally disseminated COVID-19 cases under the emergency-response control measure. We also applied polynomial regression analysis to estimate the trend of the COVID-19 in the YRD region before and after the control activities against the spread of the infection were instituted. The results show that the control measures applied have been effective. And, in the YRD region, areas with a large influx of population flow from Wuhan and Hubei Province had high risks of COVID-19. Therefore, identification of the spatiotemporal trends should be the first step when developing effective policies to manage and control any new epidemic.

Adverse events, including nausea, vomiting, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, were graded, and the relationship between Ccr and the incidence of adverse events was examined using multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS A multivariable analysis indicated that the incidence of grade ≥2 nausea increased, while the incidence of other adverse events tended to be higher, as the Ccr decreased. Particularly, renal dysfunction (Ccr <60 ml/min) was a significant risk factor for grade ≥2 nausea (p=0.042).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten transumbilical SPLPN were performed using the R-Port (Advanced Surgical Concepts, Wicklow, Ireland) multi-instrument port, a 5-mm flexible laparoscope (Olympus Surgical, Orangeburg, NY, USA), and custom-engineered articulating needle drivers, graspers, and scissors (Cambridge Endo, Framingham, MA, USA). After general anaesthesia, the pig was placed in the flank position. After umbilical placement of the R-Port, Gerota's fascia was incised and hilar dissection performed with the newly engineered articulating instruments. Either the upper or lower pole of the kidney was scored and excised after placing a bulldog clamp on the renal pedicle. The bolsters were prepared with absorbable haemostat, placed at the site of excision, and secured with polyglactin sutures. RESULTS A fascial incision of > or =2.5 cm should be made to allow adequate room for passing the instruments. Also, use of the 5 mm flexible laparoscope minimizes instrument crowding and allows for optimal visualization. The mean (sd, range) time for hilum dissection was 12.2 (4.3, 7-20) min, while that for total excision was 9.8 (1.7, 8-12) min. Modified suturing techniques were developed to achieve reconstruction in a small working space. Specialized instrumentation is essential for a successful SPLPN with no need for an additional port for triangulation. The mean duration of intracorporeal suturing was 27.7 min (declining from 40 to 15 min). The total ischaemia time decreased from 50 min in the first case to 27 min in the last (mean 37.4 min). The mean estimated blood loss was 81.1 (31.7, 50-150) mL.

The devastation among these groups far outstripped their privileged counterparts due to convergence of disadvantages that created a perfect storm of exposures. We used empirical evidence incorporated into a theoretical framework analyzing vulnerabilities that have long plagued these communities. These exposures were further exacerbated by the rapid transmission of this virus and impaired the capability of these communities to escape illness and death due to a lack of adequate public health and medical responses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This was an institutional review board-approved single-center observational clinical study in 29 patients with 34 aneurysms elected to be treated by endovascular intervention. After providing informed consent, patients were included according to the following criteria: aneurysm fundus-to-neck ratio <2 or neck diameter >4 mm, fusiform, dissecting, or giant aneurysms. The primary end point for clinical safety was the absence of death, absence of major or minor stroke, and absence of transient ischemic attack. The primary end point for treatment efficacy was complete angiographic occlusion according to the O'Kelly Marotta grading scale immediately after the procedure and at follow-up after 3 and 6 months (O'Kelly Marotta D: complete occlusion). RESULTS The Flow-Redirection Intraluminal Device deployment was technically successful in all cases. In 26/29 (89%) of patients, the primary end point of safety was reached; in the 3 remaining patients, 1 disabling ischemic stroke and 2 minor strokes with complete recovery at follow-up were observed. Angiographic (DSA and MRA) and clinical follow-up were available after 3 months in 29/29 (100%) and after 6 months in 25/29 (86%) patients (after 6 months, only MRA follow-up was performed according to our study protocol and institutional standard). At 3-month follow-up, complete occlusion was reached in 19/34 aneurysms (O'Kelly Marotta D: 19/34; 56%). At 6-month follow-up, aneurysm occlusion was complete in 22/30 aneurysms (O'Kelly Marotta D: 22/30; 73%). CONCLUSIONS Deployment of the Flow-Redirection Intraluminal Device flow-diverter stent is safe and effective in the treatment of difficult-to-treat or otherwise untreatable intracranial aneurysms.","Möhlenbruch, M A; Herweh, C; Jestaedt, L; Stampfl, S; Schönenberger, S; Ringleb, P A; Bendszus, M; Pham, M",AJNR.

75212,Rewiring of cellular membrane homeostasis by picornaviruses.,2014,"Bone homeostasis requires continuous remodeling of bone matrix to maintain structural integrity. This involves extensive communication between bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts to orchestrate balanced progenitor cell recruitment and activation. Only a few mediators controlling progenitor activation are known to date and have been targeted for intervention of bone disorders such as osteoporosis. To identify druggable pathways, we generated a medaka (Oryzias latipes) osteoporosis model, where inducible expression of receptor-activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (Rankl) leads to ectopic formation of osteoclasts and excessive bone resorption, which can be assessed by live imaging. Here we show that upon Rankl induction, osteoblast progenitors up-regulate expression of the chemokine ligand Cxcl9l. Ectopic expression of Cxcl9l recruits mpeg1-positive macrophages to bone matrix and triggers their differentiation into osteoclasts. We also demonstrate that the chemokine receptor Cxcr3.2 is expressed in a distinct subset of macrophages in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM). Live imaging revealed that upon Rankl induction, Cxcr3.2-positive macrophages get activated, migrate to bone matrix, and differentiate into osteoclasts. Importantly, mutations in cxcr3.2 prevent macrophage recruitment and osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, Cxcr3.2 inhibition by the chemical antagonists AMG487 and NBI-74330 also reduced osteoclast recruitment and protected bone integrity against osteoporotic insult. Our data identify a mechanism for progenitor recruitment to bone resorption sites and Cxcl9l and Cxcr3.2 as potential druggable regulators of bone homeostasis and osteoporosis.","Phan, Quang Tien; Tan, Wen Hui; Liu, Ranran; Sundaram, Sudha; Buettner, Anita; Kneitz, Susanne; Cheong, Benedict; Vyas, Himanshu; Mathavan, Sinnakaruppan; Schartl, Manfred; Winkler, Christoph",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2006093117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719141/,21

76139,Scale-up bioprocess development for production of the antibiotic valinomycin in Escherichia coli based on consistent fed-batch cultivations.,2015,"BACKGROUND Hospitalized patients who are receiving antihyperglycemic agents are at increased risk for hypoglycemia. Inpatient hypoglycemia may lead to increased risk for morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospitalization, and readmission within 30 days of discharge, which in turn may lead to increased costs. Hospital-wide initiatives targeting hypoglycemia are known to be beneficial; however, their impact on patient care and economic measures in community nonteaching hospitals are unknown. METHODS This retrospective quality improvement study examined the effects of hospital-wide hypoglycemia initiatives on the rates of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in a community hospital setting from January 1, 2016, until September 30, 2019. The potential cost of care savings has been calculated. RESULTS Among 49 315 total patient days, 2682 days had an instance of hypoglycemia (5.4%). Mean ± SD hypoglycemic patient days/month was 59.6 ± 16.0. The frequency of hypoglycemia significantly decreased from 7.5% in January 2016 to 3.9% in September 2019 (P = .001). Patients with type 2 diabetes demonstrated a significant decrease in the frequency of hypoglycemia (7.4%-3.8%; P < .0001), while among patients with type 1 diabetes the frequency trended downwards but did not reach statistical significance (18.5%-18.0%; P = 0.08). Based on the reduction of hypoglycemia rates, the hospital had an estimated cost of care savings of $98 635 during the study period. CONCLUSIONS In a community hospital setting, implementation of hospital-wide initiatives targeting hypoglycemia resulted in a significant and sustainable decrease in the rate of insulin-induced hypoglycemia. These high-leverage risk reduction strategies may be translated into considerable cost savings and could be implemented at other community hospitals.","Shelton, Carter; Demidowich, Andrew P; Motevalli, Mahsa; Sokolinsky, Sam; MacKay, Periwinkle; Tucker, Cynthia; Abundo, Cora; Peters, Eileen; Gooding, Roliette; Hackett, Margaret; Wedler, Joyce; Alexander, Lee Ann; Barry, Luvenia; Flynn, Mary; Rios, Patricia; Fulda, Constance Lulu; Young, Michelle F; Kahl, Barbara; Pummer, Eileen; Mathioudakis, Nestoras N; Sidhaye, Aniket; Howell, Eric E; Rotello, Leo; Zilbermint, Mihail",Journal of diabetes science and technology,https://doi.org/10.1177/19322968211008513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33880952/,21

They are fecund, short-lived, and have a complex life history involving offshore spawning, inshore mangrove-lined nursery grounds, and migrations between the two locations. We have reviewed and assessed published research on: the fisheries and aquaculture; taxonomy and identification; distribution and habitat preferences; growth; mortality; food and feeding; predation, and the importance of the mangrove habitat to banana prawns. We have examined the life history patterns of these two banana prawns and the many environmental and biological factors that affect different life history stages, often resulting in large interannual variations in abundances of adult prawns and commercial catches. We have also reviewed research on the ecosystem relationships involving these prawns, including fishery impacts on the environment and other species caught as bycatch. In reviewing the published information on factors affecting recruitment dynamics and variability, we have sometimes found contrasting and confounding results, suggesting that these factors are not yet fully understood. Therefore, for each aspect of the prawns' biology we have pointed to areas with incomplete or conflicted understanding, which will hopefully guide future research on these extremely valuable prawn species.","Vance, David J; Rothlisberg, Peter C",Advances in marine biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.amb.2020.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600543/,21

This article presents a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to ascertain if methylprednisolone can be recommended for use in patients with COVID-19 to prevent deaths. METHODS Systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and preprint servers until 13th April 2021. The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. The random-effects model for the meta-analysis was utilized to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) at 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS Five RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR for all-cause mortality was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.29 -1.43, n=652) comparing methylprednisolone with the control, indicating no mortality benefits. A similar finding was noted with a sub-group analysis including four trials that used low-dose methylprednisolone. However, the only trial that administered high doses of methylprednisolone indicated a statistically significant mortality benefit (OR 0.08, 95% CI: 0.02-0.42). CONCLUSIONS A short duration (3 to 5 days) pulse therapy of high-dose methylprednisolone can be a promising alternative to the low-dose dexamethasone therapy in severely ill patients with COVID-19 to prevent deaths.","Hasan, Syed Shahzad; Kow, Chia Siang; Mustafa, Zia Ul; Merchant, Hamid A",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2021.1925546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33945381/,21

Many patients with neurological disorders are well suited to evaluations through video. The department of neurology at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Neurology), with the support of the health system, rapidly expanded telemedicine services to meet the needs of our patient population. This accomplishment required the complex coordination of multiple disciplines and roles within the department and the health care system, including faculty, residents, administrative staff, research and technical staff, information services, and the connected health team. Procedures for provider and patient education were established. Surveys of the provider and patient experience were developed and deployed. The process has demonstrated the vital role telemedicine in neurology (teleneurology) should play in the care of neurological patients beyond the pandemic. We describe our experience as a template for other departments and practices seeking to establish teleneurology programs, as well as an illustration of the challenges and barriers to its implementation.","Spindler, Meredith; Jacobs, Dina; Yuan, Kristy; Tropea, Thomas; Teng, Clare W; Perrone, Christopher; Do, David; Wechsler, Lawrence",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33337290/,21

In this study our objective was to evaluate the antioxidant activity in substantia nigra and striatum of rats chronically treated with organic or conventional purple grape juice and to correlate the results obtained with the polyphenol content (total polyphenolic content, resveratrol, and anthocyanins [malvidin, delphinidin, peonidin, and cyanidin]). We observed that CCl(4) damage decreased significantly in the grape juice-treated groups when compared with the control group. In the grape juice-treated groups we further observed a decrease of lipid (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances assay) and protein (carbonyl) peroxidation, as well as a significant antioxidant protection through the increase of enzyme activity. Antioxidant activities were significantly correlated with polyphenol content. These findings demonstrated that both grape juices have potent antioxidant properties and these activities could be at least attributed to the high phenolic content present in these juices.","Dani, Caroline; Pasquali, Matheus A B; Oliveira, Marcos R; Umezu, Fernanda M; Salvador, Mirian; Henriques, João A P; Moreira, José C F",Journal of medicinal food,https://doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2007.505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18361738/,21

RECENT FINDINGS A growing HCT population reflects more transplants and improved long-term survival. We continue to learn about the epidemiologic and prognostic significance of posttransplant pulmonary infections. Mold-active triazoles have removed invasive fungal pneumonia as a barrier to transplant eligibility. Ibrutinib and respiratory viruses are newly recognized risk factors for invasive fungal disease. Prophylaxis has elevated concerns of resistance in invasive fungal species and late onset Cytomegalovirus. The impact of human herpesviruses, community-associated respiratory viruses, and the microbiome is increasingly appreciated. Multiple antiviral therapies are currently in clinical trials and novel molecular diagnostics may improve the performance of bronchoscopy for infectious causes. SUMMARY Fungal and viral pneumonias remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the HCT population. Despite our increased understanding of the epidemiology and outcomes of species-specific diagnoses, the utility of invasive diagnostic testing continues to be debated and effective therapies for many clinically relevant pathogens remain limited.

METHODS Inborn infants <1250 g who had eye exams were compared at two centres in three periods. In Period 1, SpO₂ target was ≥93% and pulse oximetry technology was the same in both Centres. In Period 2, guidelines for SpO₂ 88-93% were implemented at both centres and Centre B changed to oximeters with signal extraction technology (SET(®)) while Centre A did not, but did so in Period 3. One ophthalmology department performed eye exams using international criteria. RESULTS In 571 newborns <1250 g, birth weight and gestational age were similar in the different periods and centres. At Centre A, severe ROP and need for laser remained the same in Periods 1 and 2, decreasing in Period 3-6% and 3%, respectively. At Centre B, severe ROP decreased from 12% (Period 1) to 5% (Period 2) and need for laser decreased from 5% to 3%, remaining low in Period 3. CONCLUSION In a large group of inborn infants <1250 g, a change in clinical practice in combination with pulse oximetry with Masimo SET, but not without it, led to significant reduction in severe ROP and need for laser therapy.

There are indoor spaces, such as dwellings, in which the transmission risk is high. This research aims to record and analyse risk close contacts in this scope, experimentally assessing the effectiveness of using electronic proximity warning sound devices or systems. For this purpose, the methodology is based on monitoring the location of the occupants of a dwelling. Then, the days in which a proximity warning sound system is installed and activated are compared to the days in which the system is not activated. The results stressed the significant reduction of time and number of close contacts among individuals when the warning was activated. Regarding the relation between the number and the duration of close contacts, together with the reductions mentioned, the possibility of making certain predictions based on the distributions obtained is proved.

Genetic counseling (GC) is important for accurate risk assessment, diagnosis, and management of inherited cancers. Numerous barriers prevent AYA access to genetic services. This study describes outcomes of a genetic evaluation initiative (GEI) regarding utilization of genetic services among AYAs. Methods: To improve AYA access to GC, the AYA program at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center implemented GEI, a process for identifying and referring eligible patients for GC. We collected retrospective electronic medical record data between July 12, 2018 and July 12, 2019 to capture AYA's clinical characteristics, genetic referral, scheduled appointments, counseling, testing, and results. Results: In total, 516 AYAs were referred to the AYA clinic during the study period with a median age of first cancer diagnosis of 17 years. One hundred sixty-six AYAs were identified who would benefit from genetic evaluation, 57 (34.3%) of whom had previously undergone counseling. One hundred nine patients were recommended for referral to GC, and 64.2% (70/109) were referred by the AYA team. To date, 58.6% (41/70) met with a genetic counselor and 75.6% (31/41) completed genetic testing, which yielded 1 pathogenic, 2 uncertain, and 29 benign results.

82602,Retrotranslocation of prion proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum by preventing GPI signal transamidation.,2008,"Prediction of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) has been an important aspect of Pharmacovigilance because of its impact in the pharma industry. The standard process of introduction of a new drug into a market involves a lot of clinical trials and tests. This is a tedious and time consuming process and also involves a lot of monetary resources. The faster approval of a drug helps the patients who are in need of the drug. The in silico prediction of Adverse Drug Reactions can help speed up the aforementioned process. The challenges involved are lack of negative data present and predicting ADR from just the chemical structure. Although many models are already available to predict ADR, most of the models use biological activities identifiers, chemical and physical properties in addition to chemical structures of the drugs. But for most of the new drugs to be tested, only chemical structures will be available. The performance of the existing models predicting ADR only using chemical structures is not efficient. Therefore, an efficient prediction of ADRs from just the chemical structure has been proposed in this paper. The proposed method involves a separate model for each ADR, making it a binary classification problem. This paper presents a novel CNN model called Drug Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to predict ADRs using chemical structures of the drugs. The performance is measured using the metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Specificity, F1 score, AUROC and MCC. The results obtained by the proposed DCNN model outperform the competing models on the SIDER4.1 database in terms of all the metrics. A case study has been performed on a COVID-19 recommended drugs, where the proposed model predicted the ADRs that are well aligned with the observations made by medical professionals using conventional methods.","Mantripragada, Anjani Sankar; Teja, Sai Phani; Katasani, Rohith Reddy; Joshi, Pratik; Masilamani, V; Ramesh, Raj",Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0219720020500468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472571/,21

83893,Microbial Screening Reveals Oral Site-Specific Locations of the Periodontal Pathogen Selenomonas noxia.,2021-06-12,"Senior medical students at the University of Auckland, New Zealand spend most of their learning time in clinical attachments. Experiential apprentice-style training is traditionally recognised as an important aspect of obtaining competency. In March 2020 they were stood down from their general practice placements in the context of a national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Acute conversion of their general practice education from experiential clinical exposure to online and offsite learning was required. This paper describes the steps taken and the underlying theoretical foundations for our expediently developed online course. Our online learning programme has three online components, reflecting the domains of educational environment theory: asynchronous discussion forums; a symposium facilitating social interactions and teacher presence, and a portfolio facilitating personal goal aspects. The latter is underpinned by a multi-theories model of adult learning, built upon the scaffolding framework that supports our entire medical curriculum.

The impact of selective removal of FIV-positive cats on the apparent prevalence in the remaining population over this three-year period was also assessed. The seroprevalences over three years were 18.8 per cent for FIV and 0.7 per cent for FeLV. For FIV, the seroprevalence decreased significantly from the first year of the programme (2010; 30.5 per cent) to the last (2012; 13.1 per cent). Sex (male) and age (adult and old cats) were risk factors, while the year of sampling (years 2011 and 2012) was a protective factor. Age, sex and location were the most relevant predictors of FIV status. The data presented in this study revealed a very high FIV seroprevalence in Belgian stray cats, while FeLV was almost absent. The selective removal of positive cats had a drastic effect on the FIV seroprevalence in the remaining cat population.","Garigliany, M; Jolly, S; Dive, M; Bayrou, C; Berthemin, S; Robin, P; Godenir, R; Petry, J; Dahout, S; Cassart, D; Thiry, E; Desmecht, D; Saegerman, C",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.103314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26744011/,21

Interestingly, significant sleep pattern shifts occurred in the context of pandemic-related social restrictions. Whether age and chronotype influenced these sleep pattern changes remains poorly understood. In this pre-registered (https://osf.io/4a3fx), web-based study, United States residents reported, in one-time assessments, demographic information, self-reported chronotype using the reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, and pre-pandemic and pandemic first wave sleep timing using the Ultrashort Munich Chronotype Questionnaire. Participants reported sleep phase delays, reduced social jetlag (SJL) and reduced social sleep restriction (SSR) during the first wave of the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. Pandemic-related changes in SJL and SSR varied with participants' age and self-reported chronotype. Young adults reported the greatest reductions in SJL and young adults and individuals with evening chronotypes reported the greatest reductions in SSR. We conclude that these groups may have been the most vulnerable to social-biological sleep timing desynchrony under pre-pandemic social, occupational, and educational schedules.","Bottary, Ryan; Fields, Eric C; Kensinger, Elizabeth A; Cunningham, Tony J",Journal of sleep research,https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34608693/,21

During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical societies considered other therapeutic options due to uncertainties in the evolution of the disease. The purpose of this study is to assess the treatment of AA by members of two Brazilian surgical societies in this period. A common questionnaire was sent in 2020. There were 382 responses. Most surgeons had more than 15 years of profession (68.3%) and treated more than five cases per month (44.8%). About 72.5% would indicate chest CT to investigate COVID-19 in patients with AA. For those patients sustaining uncomplicated AA, without COVID-19, 60.2% would indicate laparoscopic appendectomy (VLA), followed by open appendectomy (OA) (31.7%) and non-operative management (NOM) (1.3%). For those with mild COVID-19, OA was suggested by 51.0%, followed by VLA (29.6%) and NOM (6.0%). For those with severe COVID-19, OA was proposed by 35.3%, followed by NOM (19.9%) and VLA (18.6%). For patients with periappendiceal abscesses, without COVID-19, VLA was suggested by 54.2%, followed by OA (33.2%) and NOM (4.4%). For those with mild COVID-19, OA was proposed in 49.5%, followed by VLA (29.3%) and NOM (8.9%). In those with severe COVID-19, OA was proposed in 36.6%, followed by NOM (25.1%) and VLA (17.3%).

87837,"Uric Acid Elevation by Favipiravir, an Antiviral Drug.",2020,"The emergence of a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV-2, and the potentially life-threating respiratory disease that it can produce, COVID-19, has rapidly spread across the globe creating a massive public health problem. Previous epidemics of many emerging viral infections have typically resulted in poor obstetrical outcomes including maternal morbidity and mortality, maternal-fetal transmission of the virus, and perinatal infections and death. This communication reviews the effects of two previous coronavirus infections - severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV - on pregnancy outcomes. In addition, it analyzes literature describing 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their newborns in China to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the mothers and infants including clinical, laboratory and virologic data, and the transmissibility of the virus from mother to fetus. This analysis reveals that unlike coronavirus infections of pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in these 38 pregnant women COVID-19 did not lead to maternal deaths. Importantly, and similar to pregnancies with SARS and MERS, there were no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their fetuses. All neonatal specimens tested, including in some cases placentas, were negative by rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. At this point in the global pandemic of COVID-19 infection there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes intrauterine or transplacental transmission from infected pregnant women to their fetuses. Analysis of additional cases is necessary to determine if this remains true.","Schwartz, David A",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0901-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32180426/,21

Despite the recent increase of robotic surgery, the place and potential advantages of the robot in thoracic surgery has not been well defined until now. Methods We reviewed our prospective database for retrospective comparison of our first 28 video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomies (V group) and our first 28 robotic lobectomies (R group). Results No significant difference was shown in median operative time between the two groups (185 vs. 190 minutes, p = 0.56). Median preincision time was significantly longer in the R group (80 vs. 60 minutes, P < 0.0001). The rate of emergency conversion for uncontrolled bleeding was lower in the R group (one vs. four). Median length of stay was comparable (6 days in the R group vs. 7 days in the V group, p = 0.4) with no significant difference in the rate of postoperative complications (eight Grade I in both groups, four Grade III or IV in the V group vs. six in the R group, according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, p = 0.93). No postoperative cardiac morbidity was observed in the R group. Median drainage time was similar (5 days, p = 0.78), with a rate of prolonged air leak slightly higher in the R group (25 vs. 17.8%, p = 0.74). Conclusion Perioperative outcomes are similar even in the learning period but robotic approach seems to offer more operative safety with fewer conversions for uncontrolled bleeding.","Mahieu, Julien; Rinieri, Philippe; Bubenheim, Michael; Calenda, Emile; Melki, Jean; Peillon, Christophe; Baste, Jean-Marc",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0035-1548733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25866978/,21

92058,"Human RNA ""rumor"" viruses: the search for novel human retroviruses in chronic disease.",2008,"BACKGROUND An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal ballooning of the major abdominal artery. Some AAAs present as emergencies and require surgery; others remain asymptomatic. Treatment of asymptomatic AAAs depends on many factors, but the size of the aneurysm is important, as risk of rupture increases with aneurysm size. Large asymptomatic AAAs (greater than 5.5 cm in diameter) are usually repaired surgically; very small AAAs (less than 4.0 cm diameter) are monitored with ultrasonography. Debate continues over the roles of early repair versus surveillance with repair on subsequent enlargement in people with asymptomatic AAAs of 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm diameter. This is the fourth update of the review first published in 1999. OBJECTIVES To compare mortality and costs, as well as quality of life and aneurysm rupture as secondary outcomes, following early surgical repair versus routine ultrasound surveillance in people with asymptomatic AAAs between 4.0 cm and 5.5 cm in diameter. SEARCH METHODS The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two other databases, and two trials registers to 10 July 2019. We handsearched conference proceedings and checked reference lists of relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials where people with asymptomatic AAAs of 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm were randomly allocated to early repair or imaging-based surveillance at least every six months. Outcomes had to include mortality or survival. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Three review authors independently extracted data, which were cross-checked by other team members. Outcomes were mortality, costs, quality of life, and aneurysm rupture. For mortality, we estimated risk ratios (RR) (endovascular aneurysm repair only), hazard ratios (HR) (open repair only), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on Mantel-Haenszel Chi2 statistics at one and six years (open repair only) following randomisation. MAIN RESULTS We found no new studies for this update. Four trials with 3314 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two trials compared early open repair with surveillance and two trials compared early endovascular repair (EVAR) with surveillance. We used GRADE to access the certainty of the evidence for mortality and cost, which ranged from high to low. We downgraded the certainty in the evidence from high to moderate and low due to risk of bias concerns and imprecision (some outcomes were only reported by one study). All four trials showed an early survival benefit in the surveillance group (due to 30-day operative mortality with repair) but no evidence of differences in long-term survival. One study compared early open repair with surveillance with an adjusted HR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.02, mean follow-up 10 years; HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.54, mean follow-up 4.9 years). Pooled analysis of participant-level data from the two trials comparing early open repair with surveillance (maximum follow-up seven to eight years) showed no evidence of a difference in survival (propensity score-adjusted HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.18; 2226 participants; high-certainty evidence). This lack of treatment effect did not vary to three years by AAA diameter (P = 0.39), participant age (P = 0.61), or for women (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.11). Two studies compared EVAR with surveillance and there was no evidence of a survival benefit for early EVAR at 12 months (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.73 to 5.06; 846 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported costs. The mean UK health service costs per participant over the first 18 months after randomisation were higher in the open repair surgery than the surveillance group (GBP 4978 in the repair group versus GBP 3914 in the surveillance group; mean difference (MD) GBP 1064, 95% CI 796 to 1332; 1090 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was a similar difference after 12 years. The mean USA hospital costs for participants at six months after randomisation were higher in the EVAR group than in the surveillance group (USD 33,471 with repair versus USD 5520 with surveillance; MD USD 27,951, 95% CI 25,156 to 30,746; 614 participants; low-certainty evidence). After four years, there was no evidence of a difference in total medical costs between groups (USD 48,669 with repair versus USD 46,112 with surveillance; MD USD 2557, 95% CI -8043 to 13,156; 614 participants; low-certainty evidence). All studies reported quality of life but used different assessment measurements and results were conflicting. All four studies reported aneurysm rupture. There were very few ruptures reported in the trials of EVAR versus surveillance up to three years. In the trials of open surgery versus surveillance, there were ruptures to at least six years and there were more ruptures in the surveillance group, but most of these ruptures occurred in aneurysms that had exceeded the threshold for surgical repair. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There was no evidence of an advantage to early repair for small AAA (4.0 cm to 5.5 cm), regardless of whether open repair or EVAR is used and, at least for open repair, regardless of patient age and AAA diameter. Thus, neither early open nor early EVAR of small AAAs is supported by currently available evidence. Long-term data from the two trials investigating EVAR are not available, so, we can only draw firm conclusions regarding outcomes after the first few years for open repair. Research regarding the risks related to and management of small AAAs in ethnic minorities and women is urgently needed, as data regarding these populations are lacking.","Ulug, Pinar; Powell, Janet T; Martinez, Melissa Ashley-Marie; Ballard, David J; Filardo, Giovanni",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd001835.pub5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609382/,21
93069,Mass Spectrometry of Polyurethanes.,2019-10-24,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence and associated factors to COVID-19 in people with flu-like syndrome in Ceará-Brazil. BACKGROUND COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has led to a worldwide public health emergency. More than 30,000 cases were confirmed in Brazil, especially in the States of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Ceará. The capital of the Ceará State is the one with the highest incidence of COVID-19 in Brazil. Estimating the prevalence of the disease and its associated factors is important to offer adequate health care. DESIGN A cross-sectional study with secondary data of people notified with flu-like syndrome and COVID-19 test results. METHODS 19,967 cases of flu-like syndrome were analyzed according to the result of the COVID-19 test. Predictive variables were: age range, sex, women in puerperium, presence or absence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hematological illness, immunodeficiencies, neurological diseases, obesity, renal diseases, and Down's syndrome. Robust Poisson regression models estimated the prevalence ratios of COVID-19. The research was reported via STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies. RESULTS The prevalence of COVID-19 in the population was 10.37%. In the final model, the following variables were associated with COVID-19: aged people, male sex, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes. CONCLUSION among the flu-like syndrome cases, COVD-19 prevalence was high. In the Ceará State, clinical factors such as aged people, male sex, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes can enhance the prevalence of COVID-19 by up to 2.57 times. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE The identification of factors that are associated with the enhanced prevalence of COVID-19 facilitates early diagnosis, adequate and prompt treatment. This knowledge may avoid an unfavorable prognosis of the disease.","Garces, Thiago Santos; Florêncio, Raquel Sampaio; Cestari, Virna Ribeiro Feitosa; Pereira, Maria Lúcia Duarte; Moreira, Thereza Maria Magalhães; Bezerra Sousa, George Jó",Journal of clinical nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32860280/,21

METHODS Clinical studies of convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin in the treatment of SARS were collected from a variety of databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, and CBM from November 2002 to March 2020. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias based on the national institute for health and clinical excellence case series quality scale, and systematically evaluated the results. RESULTS A total of 10 clinical studies, including 212 patients, were eventually included. There were 4 case series studies, 5 case reports and 1 case-control study. Most studies were with low or very low quality. The systematic analysis showed that 107 patients administered convalescent plasma and 16 patients used immunoglobulin during the treatment of SARS. Forty-nine patients were definitely not treated with the above two methods, and the remaining 40 patients were not reported clearly. The treatment of convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin could both improve the symptoms and reduce the mortality (12 died), and most SARS patients got better, while 11 SARS patients who did not receive the above therapies died. CONCLUSIONS Convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin were effective on relieving symptoms of SARS patients. However, due to low quality and lacking of control group, convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin should be used with caution to treat COVID-19 patients.","Zhu, Tiantian; Xu, Aihui; Bai, Xiaojie; He, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Hong",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200326-00240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32527348/,21

We aimed to characterise the changes in cardiopulmonary physiology during the neonatal transition in an ovine model of CDH. METHODS A diaphragmatic hernia (DH) was surgically created at 80 days of gestational age (dGA) in 10 fetuses, whereas controls underwent sham surgery (n=6). At 138 dGA, lambs were delivered via caesarean section and ventilated for 2 hours. Physiological and ventilation parameters were continuously recorded, and arterial blood gas values were measured. RESULTS DH lambs had lower wet lung-to-body-weight ratio (0.016±0.002vs0.033±0.004), reduced dynamic lung compliance (0.4±0.1mL/cmH2O vs1.2±0.1 mL/cmH2O) and reduced arterial pH (7.11±0.05vs7.26±0.05), compared with controls. While measured pulmonary blood flow (PBF) was lower in DH lambs, after correction for lung weight, PBF was not different between groups (4.05±0.60mL/min/gvs4.29±0.57 mL/min/g). Cerebral tissue oxygen saturation was lower in DH compared with control lambs (55.7±3.5vs67.7%±3.9%). CONCLUSIONS Immediately after birth, DH lambs have small, non-compliant lungs, respiratory acidosis and poor cerebral oxygenation that reflects the clinical phenotype of human CDH. PBF (indexed to lung weight) was similar in DH and control lambs, suggesting that the reduction in PBF associated with CDH is proportional to the degree of lung hypoplasia during the neonatal cardiopulmonary transition.","Kashyap, Aidan J; Crossley, Kelly J; DeKoninck, Philip L J; Rodgers, Karyn A; Thio, Marta; Skinner, Sasha M; Deprest, Jan A; Hooper, Stuart B; Hodges, Ryan J",Archives of disease in childhood.

98071,How Prevalent Is Cancer in Confirmed Cases with Coronaviruses and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes?,2021,"INTRODUCTION Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) is an endoscopic operating platform for local excision of rectal neoplasms. However, it may be technically demanding, and its learning curve has yet to be adequately defined. The objective of this study was to determine the number of TAMIS procedures for the local excision of rectal neoplasm required to reach proficiency. METHODS AND PROCEDURES All TAMIS cases performed from 07/2009 to 12/2016 at a single high-volume tertiary care institution for local excision of benign and malignant rectal neoplasia were identified from a prospective database. A cumulative summation (CUSUM) analysis was performed to determine the number of cases required to reach proficiency. The main proficiency outcome was rate of margin positivity (R1 resection). The acceptable and unacceptable R1 rates were defined as the R1 rate of transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM-10%) and traditional transanal excision (TAE-26%), which was obtained from previously published meta-analyses. Comparisons of patient, tumor, and operative characteristics before and after TAMIS proficiency were performed. RESULTS A total of 254 TAMIS procedures were included in this study. The overall R1 resection rate was 7%. The indication for TAMIS was malignancy in 57%. CUSUM analysis reported that TAMIS reached an acceptable R1 rate between 14 and 24 cases. Moving average plots also showed that the mean operative times stabilized by proficiency gain. The mean lesion size was larger after proficiency gain (3.0 cm (SD 1.5) vs. 2.3 cm (SD 1.3), p = 0.008). All other patient, tumor, and operative characteristics were similar before and after proficiency gain. CONCLUSIONS TAMIS for local excision of rectal neoplasms is a complex procedure that requires a minimum of 14-24 cases to reach an acceptable R1 resection rate and lower operative duration.","Lee, Lawrence; Kelly, Justin; Nassif, George J; Keller, Deborah; Debeche-Adams, Teresa C; Mancuso, Paul A; Monson, John R; Albert, Matthew R; Atallah, Sam B",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5817-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28812153/,21

These results show TMA is an analytically sensitive and specific method for detection of Tp rRNA and is compatible with serum specimens in addition to pharyngeal and rectal mucocutaneous swab specimens. Automated real time TMA testing for T. pallidum may be useful as an adjunctive method with serology for screening and diagnostic testing of selected patient populations for syphilis.","Getman, Damon; Lin, Mike; Barakat, Nesreen; Skvoretz, Rhonda; Godornes, Charmie; Swenson, Paul; Nenninger, Ashley; Golden, Matthew R; Lukehart, Sheila A",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00511-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980645/,21

The rapid onset of action of the NOACs, their relatively short half-live, and the availability of specific reversal agents may be advantageous when managing acute ischemic strokes, and in the post-stroke, post-transient ischemic attack, and post-intracranial hemorrhage settings. In this review article, we offer practical guidance on the use of NOACs in these settings, focusing on managing the acute event and on initiating or resuming anticoagulation for secondary prevention. We also assess the use of NOACs to prevent stroke and bleeding in patients with AF who have chronic kidney disease, are elderly, or cognitively impaired, and we offer guidance on optimizing the use of NOACs and VKAs in these patient groups in the absence of evidence-based guidelines.","Diener, Hans-Christoph; Kleinschnitz, Christoph",Journal of stroke,https://doi.org/10.5853/jos.2016.00157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27165264/,21

To date, this technique required a complete substitution of the ureter with ileum. In this work we present our robotic intracorporeal sub-total ureteral substitution preserving the distal part of the ureter with the aim to reduce the risk of vescico-ureteral reflux. We report the case of a 65-years old male with a ""functional"" right single kidney and multiple recurrent stenosis. Our technique seems to be feasible and safe, no intra or postoperative complication were recorded. At 3 months of follow-up the trans-nephrostomic enhanced CT showed a completely opacification of ileal ureter, thus the nephrostomic tube was removed. At 6 and 12 months the patient was asymptomatic and with a level of serum creatinine 1.9 and 1.6 mg/dL, respectively. In conclusion the sub-total ureteral substitution with ileum can be a safety and effective procedure for patients who require a mandatory preservation of homolateral renal function.","Porpiglia, Francesco; Checcucci, Enrico; Piramide, Federico; Amparore, Daniele; Fiori, Cristian; Hemal, Ashok",Translational andrology and urology,https://doi.org/10.21037/tau.2019.12.32; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420213/,21

98937,"How COVID-19 Has Globalized: Unknown Origin, Rapid Transmission, and the Immune System Nourishment.",2021,"BACKGROUND Undergraduate biomedical engineering (BME) students interested in pursuing a career in research and development of medical or physiological monitoring devices require a strong foundation in biosignal analysis as well as physiological theory. Applied learning approaches are reported to be effective for reinforcing physiological coursework; therefore, we propose a new laboratory protocol for BME undergraduate physiology courses that integrates both neural engineering and physiological concepts to explore involuntary skeletal muscle reflexes. The protocol consists of two sections: the first focuses on recruiting soleus motor units through transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), while the second focuses on exploring the natural stretch reflex with and without the Jendrassik maneuver. In this case study, third-year biomedical engineering students collected electromyographic (EMG) activity of skeletal muscle contractions in response to peripheral nerve stimulation using a BioRadio Wireless Physiology Monitor system and analyzed the corresponding signal parameters (latency and amplitude) using the MATLAB platform. RESULTS/PROTOCOL VALIDATION Electrical tibial nerve stimulation successfully recruited M-waves in all 8 student participants and F-waves in three student participants. The students used this data to learn about orthodromic and antidromic motor fiber activation as well as estimate the neural response latency and amplitude. With the stretch reflex, students were able to collect distinct signals corresponding to the tendon strike and motor response. From this, they were able to estimate the sensorimotor conduction velocity. Additionally, a significant increase in the stretch reflex EMG amplitude response was observed when using the Jendrassik maneuver during the knee-jerk response. A student exit survey on the laboratory experience reported that the class found the module engaging and helpful for reinforcing physiological course concepts. CONCLUSION This newly developed protocol not only allows BME students to explore physiological responses using natural and electrically-induced involuntary reflexes, but demonstrates that budget-friendly commercially available devices are capable of eliciting and measuring involuntary reflexes in an engaging manner. Despite some limitations caused by the equipment and students' lack of signal processing experience, this new laboratory protocol provides a robust framework for integrating engineering and physiology in an applied approach for BME students to learn about involuntary reflexes, neurophysiology, and neural engineering.","Franz, Karly S; Patel, Kramay; Kilkenny, Dawn M",Journal of biological engineering,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13036-020-00248-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33292462/,21
99103,Drivers of disease emergence and spread: is wildlife to blame?,2014,"OBJECTIVE Abnormal liver function has been noticed as common extra pulmonary organ damage of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Severe patients had a higher probability and progression of liver injury compared with non-severe patients. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of liver injury in COVID-19 patients. METHODS We retrospectively included 502 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection. Clinical features and survival of patients with and without liver injury were compared. Cox proportional hazard ratio models were used to find the variables that have an effect on survival. RESULTS Among enrolled 502 patients, 301 patients had abnormal liver function with increased neutrophil count, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, troponin (TnI), D-dimer, lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK). Compared to patients with normal liver functions, those with abnormal liver functions had higher mortality rate (28.9% vs 9.0%, P<0.001), higher ratio of male patients (65.1% vs 40.8%, P<0.001) and higher chance of SIRS development (53.5% vs 41.3%, P=0.007). Among patients with abnormal liver functions, liver damage grade 2 patients (both ALT/AST and ALP/GGT abnormal) had higher ratio of male patients, neutrophil count, PCT, D-dimer and mortality rate. Multivariate Cox regression analyses suggested that grade of liver damage (HR:1.377, 95%CI:1.000-1.896, P=0.049) was an independent predictor of death. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients with abnormal liver functions have a higher mortality. Liver damage is an independent prognostic factor of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

The increasing prevalence of malignancy has become a leading cause of human mortality. However, conflicting findings have been published on the association between malignancy and COVID-19 severity. This study aims to assess the pooled proportion of malignancy amongst 2019-nCov patients and to investigate the association between malignancy and COVID-19 severity. METHODS Correlative studies were identi?ed by systematically searching electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Sciences and Embase) up to September 2, 2020. All data analyses were carried out using Stata 15.0. RESULTS Twenty-nine studies consisting of 9475 confirmed COVID-19 patients (median age 54.4 years [IQR 49-62], 54.0% men) were included. The overall proportion of malignancy was 2.5% (95% CI 1.6%-3.4%). The proportion of malignancy was higher in patients with severe/critical 2019-nCoV than those in non-severe/non-critical group (3.9% [95% CI 2.0-6.3] vs 1.4% [95% CI 0.8-2.2]). Furthermore, pre-existing malignancy was associated with more than twofold higher risk of severe/critical patients with COVID-19 (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.65-3.06 I2 = 0.0%). CONCLUSION Malignancy was associated with up to 2.3-fold higher risk of severe/critical COVID-19 and may serve as a clinical predictor for adverse outcomes.","Liu, G E; Cai, Wei; Liu, Huan; Jiang, Hai Hong; Yi Bi, Yong; Wang, Hong",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2101-192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34022777/,21

Because LRRK2 regulates important cellular processes, developing inhibitors that can selectively target the pathogenic variant while sparing normal LRRK2 activity could offer potential advantages in heterozygous carriers.

Although mass screening of body temperature with handheld, non-contact infrared thermometers and thermal imagine scanners is now widespread in a kaleidoscope of social and healthcare settings for the purpose of detecting febrile individuals bearing SARS-CoV-2 infection, this strategy carries some drawbacks, which will be highlighted and discussed in this article. These caveats basically include high rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, the challenging definition of ""normal"" body temperature, variation of measured values according to the body district, false negative cases due to antipyretics, device inaccuracy, impact of environmental temperature, along with the low specificity of this symptom for screening COVID-19 in patients with other febrile conditions. Some pragmatic suggestions will also be endorsed for increasing accuracy and precision of mass screening of body temperature. These encompass the regular assessment of body temperature (possibly twice) with validated devices, which shall be constantly monitored over time and used following manufacturer's instructions, the definition of a range of ""normal"" body temperatures in the local population, patients interrogation on usual body temperature, measurement standardization of one body district, allowance of sufficient environmental acclimatization before temperature check, integration with contact history and other clinical information, along with exclusion of other causes of increased body temperature.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and psychological status of a specific population using an internet consultation platform during the outbreak of COVID-19. The questionnaire survey included questions regarding basic information (e.g. area, sex, age, occupation, and education level), clinical characteristics, and cognitive and psychological status concerning COVID-19 from January 31, 2020 to March 31, 2020. There were 277 patients (43.49%) with three or more symptoms, 121 (12.11%) with a clinical questionnaire score ≥8, and 6.81% who lived in Hubei in the previous 14 days. Of the respondents, 4.9% had contact fever or were confirmed to have COVID-19 in the previous 14 days. The respondents were mostly aware that COVID-19 can be transmitted from person to person and via the respiratory tract, but awareness of general susceptibility and specific symptoms of COVID-19 was low. Multivariate analysis showed that urban residents, clerk/students and higher education groups were well aware of COVID-19. Regarding mental health, the anxiety score of the respondents was 7.12 ± 2.32, and the proportion of anxiety was 54.15%. Younger women were more likely to have anxiety when they experienced positive symptoms. Individuals with a Hubei residence history and those who had contact with an individual with a fever or were confirmed patients in the previous 14 days were more likely to have moderate or severe anxiety. The COVID-19-related knowledge of the respondents was generally good but still could have been improved. Their psychological status was also affected by the pandemic.

Covert stroke in the non-surgical setting is much more common than overt stroke and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Little is known about covert stroke after non-cardiac, non-carotid artery surgery. METHODS We undertook a prospective, international cohort study to determine the incidence of covert stroke after non-cardiac, non-carotid artery surgery. Eligible patients were ≥65 yr of age and were admitted to hospital for at least three nights after non-cardiac, non-carotid artery surgery. Patients underwent a brain magnetic resonance study between postoperative days 3 and 10. The main outcome was the incidence of perioperative covert stroke. RESULTS We enrolled a total of 100 patients from six centres in four countries. The incidence of perioperative covert stroke was 10.0% (10/100 patients, 95% confidence interval 5.5-17.4%). Five of the six centres that enrolled patients reported an incident covert stroke, and covert stroke was found in patients undergoing major general (3/27), major orthopaedic (3/41), major urological or gynaecological (3/22), and low-risk surgery (1/12). CONCLUSIONS This international multicentre study suggests that 1 in 10 patients ≥65 yr of age experiences a perioperative covert stroke. A larger study is required to determine the impact of perioperative covert stroke on patient-important outcomes.

In this context, the Portuguese Medical Association invited intensive care physicians who, in collaboration with SYSADVANCE S.A., developed SYSVENT OM1, a ventilator capable of operating in controlled and assisted modes (volume and pressure) and able to treat patients admitted to intensive care units. In this study we do the proof of concept comparing programmed tidal volume, inspiratory pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure with those measured by the ventilator and an external measuring equipment. MATERIAL AND METHODS We set up the ventilator in tandem with an artificial lung and a flow analyzer. We measured expiratory tidal volume, and inspiratory pressure against three levels of compliance, each with six steps of tidal volume. Positive end-expiratory pressure was measured at 2 cmH2O incremental along eight steps. For each measurement, we performed three readings. RESULTS Considering each of the three single variables, the mean value of the highest difference between programmed values and measured values is, for all of them, within what we considered to be acceptable for a prototype model (tidal volume = -28.1 mL, inspiratory pressure = 0.8 cmH2O and positive end-expiratory pressure = -1.1 cmH2O). This difference is greater when evaluated with the external measuring equipment in comparison with the ventilator. DISCUSSION The results showed a good monitoring and accuracy performance. Technical limitations related with the artificial lung and the flow analyzer have been documented, which do not compromise the results, but limit their amplitude. CONCLUSION For tested parameters, the ventilator has a good operating performance, is in accordance with the initial premises and has potential for clinical use.","Cortesão, Nuno; Fernandes, Marco; Pina, Danielson; Fernandes, Felipe; Machado, José Vale; Carneiro, António H",Acta medica portuguesa,https://doi.org/10.20344/amp.14516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33159435/,21

While a number of studies have concentrated on smokers only, recent published data demonstrate that at least one fourth of patients with COPD are non-smokers, and that the burden of COPD in non-smokers is also higher than previously believed. Risk factors of COPD in non-smokers may include genetic factors, long-standing asthma, outdoor air pollution (from traffic and other sources), environmental smoke exposure (ETS), biomass smoke, occupational exposure, diet, recurrent respiratory infection in early childhood, tuberculosis and so on. In Asian region, indoor/outdoor air pollution and poor socioeconomic status may play important roles in the pathogenesis of non-smoking-related COPD. The prevalence of COPD among never smokers varies widely across nations. Such a variation may arise from several aspects, including study design, definition of COPD, diagnostic criteria, age and gender distribution of the studied population, local risk factors and socioeconomic status. More investigations and efforts are required to elucidate the involved factors and their shared contributions to non-smoking-related COPD so as to achieve better estimation and reduction of the burden of this neglected entity worldwide.","Zeng, Guangqiao; Sun, Baoqing; Zhong, Nanshan",Respirology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1843.2012.02152.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22845669/,21

Efficient activation of the immune system by MVA partially relies on its encounter with dendritic cells (DCs). MVA infection of DCs leads to multiple outcomes, including cytokine production, activation of costimulatory molecules for T cell stimulation, and cell death. Here, we examined how these diverse responses are orchestrated in human DCs. Single-cell analyses revealed that the response to MVA infection in DCs was limited to early viral gene expression. In response to the early events in the viral cycle, we found that DCs grouped into three distinct clusters. A cluster of infected cells sensed the MVA genome by the intracellular innate immunity pathway mediated by cGAS, STING, TBK1, and IRF3 and subsequently produced inflammatory cytokines. In response to these cytokines, a cluster of noninfected bystander cells increased costimulatory molecule expression. A separate cluster of infected cells underwent caspase-dependent apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis persisted after inhibition of innate immunity pathway mediators independently of previously described IRF-dependent or replication-dependent pathways and was a response to early MVA gene expression. Together, our study identified multiple mechanisms that underlie the interactions of MVA with human DCs.","Döring, Marius; De Azevedo, Kevin; Blanco-Rodriguez, Guillermo; Nadalin, Francesca; Satoh, Takeshi; Gentili, Matteo; Lahaye, Xavier; De Silva, Nilushi S; Conrad, Cécile; Jouve, Mabel; Centlivre, Mireille; Lévy, Yves; Manel, Nicolas",Science signaling,https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.abd9720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34429383/,21

Here, we aimed to establish whether the length of uniportal incision could affect postoperative pain and surgical outcomes in consecutive patients undergoing uniportal VATS lobectomy for early stage lung cancer. METHODS This was a unicenter Randomized Control Trial (NCT03218098). Consecutive patients undergoing uniportal VATS lobectomy for Stage I lung cancer were randomly assigned to a Small Incision group or Long Incision group in 1:1 ratio based on whether patients received a 4 cm or 8 cm incision. The endpoints were to compare the intergroup difference regarding (i) postoperative pain measured by brief pain inventory (BPI) questionnaire (first endpoint); (ii) operative time; (iii) length of chest drainage; (iv) length of hospital stay; (v) postoperative complications; and (vi) pulmonary functional status (secondary endpoints). RESULTS A total of 48 patients were eligible for the study. Four patients were excluded; the study population included 44 patients: 23 within the Small Incision group, and 21 within the Long Incision group. The 11 BPI scores between the two groups showed no significant difference. Small Incision group presented higher operative time than Long Incision group (138.69 vs. 112.14 minutes; P = 0.0001) while no significant differences were found regarding length of hospital stay (P = 0.95); respiratory complications (P = 0.92); FEV1% (P = 0.63), and 6-Minute Walking Test (P = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS A larger incision for uniportal VATS lobectomy significantly reduced the operative time due to better exposure of the anatomical structures without increasing postoperative pain or affecting the surgical outcome. KEY POINTS A larger incision for uniportal VATS lobectomy significantly reduced the operative time due to better exposure of the anatomical structures without increasing postoperative pain or affecting the surgical outcome. To perform a larger incision could be a valuable strategy, particularly in nonexpert hands or when the patient's anatomy or tumor size make exposure of anatomic structures through smaller incisions difficult.","Menna, Cecilia; Poggi, Camilla; Andreetti, Claudio; Maurizi, Giulio; Ciccone, Anna Maria; D'Andrilli, Antonio; Vanni, Camilla; Vestri, Anna Rita; Fiorelli, Alfonso; Santini, Mario; Venuta, Federico; Rendina, Erino Angelo; Ibrahim, Mohsen",Thoracic cancer,https://doi.org/10.1111/1759-7714.13291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379396/,21

Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that ORS with HCO3(-) ≤ 62 mmol/L do not interfere with abomasal milk clotting in healthy calves. However, in diarrheic calves, feeding ORS and milk simultaneously may disturb abomasal curd formation and exacerbate diarrhea due to faster abomasal passage of ingesta. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to ultrasonographically examine abomasal milk clotting and diameter after feeding milk and milk replacer (MR) with and without ORS to healthy and diarrheic calves. Abomasal curd formation and diameter in healthy and diarrheic calves were ultrasonographically imaged before and after feeding milk, MR and ORS prepared in milk or MR. Feeding mixtures of milk or MR with ORS did not cause any remarkable differences in the ultrasonographic images of abomasal content.

METHODS We prospectively analysed patients with giant hiatal hernias who underwent robotic repair during a 3 year period. Preoperative data, operative variables, complications, clinical outcomes and anatomical recurrence after 1 year were evaluated. RESULTS Six patients with giant hiatal hernias underwent robotic repair using the Da Vinci surgical system. The mean operative time was 182 min. The mean hospital stay was 6 days. No patients required reoperation for disease recurrence, and all claimed the absence of postoperative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Robotic approaches can minimize surgical trauma in patients with giant hiatal hernias and result in favourable outcomes in terms of anatomical recurrence and quality of life. With the availability of the da Vinci System, all patients with giant hiatal hernias can be offered a minimally invasive surgical option.","Morelli, Luca; Guadagni, Simone; Mariniello, Maria Donatella; Pisano, Roberta; D'Isidoro, Cristiano; Belluomini, Mario Antonio; Caprili, Giovanni; Di Candio, Giulio; Mosca, Franco",The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,https://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.1595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24869751/,21
108167,The major histocompatibility complex of Old World camelids: Class I and class I-related genes.,2019,"OBJECTIVES To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of rosiglitazone treatment on cardiovascular risk and mortality using multiple data sources and varying analytical approaches with three aims in mind: to clarify uncertainties about the cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone; to determine whether different analytical approaches are likely to alter the conclusions of adverse event meta-analyses; and to inform efforts to promote clinical trial transparency and data sharing. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. DATA SOURCES GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK's) ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com for individual patient level data (IPD) and GSK's Study Register platforms, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to January 2019 for summary level data. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Randomized, controlled, phase II-IV clinical trials that compared rosiglitazone with any control for at least 24 weeks in adults. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS For analyses of trials for which IPD were available, a composite outcome of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular related death, and non-cardiovascular related death was examined. These four events were examined independently as secondary analyses. For analyses including trials for which IPD were not available, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular related death were examined, which were determined from summary level data. Multiple meta-analyses were conducted that accounted for trials with zero events in one or both arms with two different continuity corrections (0.5 constant and treatment arm) to calculate odds ratios and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS 33 eligible trials were identified from ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com for which IPD were available (21 156 patients). Additionally, 103 trials for which IPD were not available were included in the meta-analyses for myocardial infarction (23 683 patients), and 103 trials for which IPD were not available contributed to the meta-analyses for cardiovascular related death (22 772 patients). Among 29 trials for which IPD were available and that were included in previous meta-analyses using GSK's summary level data, more myocardial infarction events were identified by using IPD instead of summary level data for 26 trials, and fewer cardiovascular related deaths for five trials. When analyses were limited to trials for which IPD were available, and a constant continuity correction of 0.5 and a random effects model were used to account for trials with zero events in only one arm, patients treated with rosiglitazone had a 33% increased risk of a composite event compared with controls (odds ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.61; rosiglitazone population: 274 events among 11 837 patients; control population: 219 events among 9319 patients). The odds ratios for myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular related death, and non-cardiovascular related death were 1.17 (0.92 to 1.51), 1.54 (1.14 to 2.09), 1.15 (0.55 to 2.41), and 1.18 (0.60 to 2.30), respectively. For analyses including trials for which IPD were not available, odds ratios for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular related death were attenuated (1.09, 0.88 to 1.35, and 1.12, 0.72 to 1.74, respectively). Results were broadly consistent when analyses were repeated using trials with zero events across both arms and either of the two continuity corrections was used. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that rosiglitazone is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, especially for heart failure events. Although increased risk of myocardial infarction was observed across analyses, the strength of the evidence varied and effect estimates were attenuated when summary level data were used in addition to IPD. Because more myocardial infarctions and fewer cardiovascular related deaths were reported in the IPD than in the summary level data, sharing IPD might be necessary when performing meta-analyses focused on safety.

109499,Configuration Flipping in Distal Pocket of Multidrug Transporter MexB Impacts the Efflux Inhibitory Mechanism.,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND Most people admitted to hospitals worldwide require a vascular access device (VAD). Hundreds of millions of VADs are inserted annually in the USA with reports of over a billion peripheral intravenous catheters used annually worldwide. Numerous reports suggest that a team approach for the assessment, insertion, and maintenance of VADs improves clinical outcomes, the patient experience, and healthcare processes. OBJECTIVES To compare the use of the vascular access specialist team (VAST) for VAD insertion and care to a generalist model approach for hospital or community participants requiring a VAD in terms of insertion success, device failure, and cost-effectiveness. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 7 February 2018); Ovid Embase (1980 to 7 February 2018); EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 7 February 2018); Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science and Social Science and Humanities (1990 to 7 February 2018); and Google Scholar. We searched the following trial registries: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (www.anzctr.org.au); ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com/mrct); HKU Clinical Trials Registry (www.hkclinicaltrials.com); Clinical Trials Registry - India (ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/login.php); UK Clinical Trials Gateway (www.controlled-trials.com/ukctr/); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (www.who.int/trialsearch). We searched all databases on 7 February 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of VAST or specialist inserters for their impact on clinical outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane and used Covidence software to assist with file management. MAIN RESULTS We retrieved 2398 citations: 30 studies were eligible for further examination of their full text, and we found one registered clinical trial in progress. No studies could be included in the analysis or review. We assigned one study as awaiting classification, as it has not been accepted for publication. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This systematic review failed to locate relevant published RCTs to support or refute the assertion that vascular access specialist teams are superior to the generalist model. A vascular access specialist team has advanced knowledge with regard to insertion techniques, clinical care, and management of vascular access devices, whereas a generalist model comprises nurses, doctors, or other designated healthcare professionals in the healthcare facility who may have less advanced insertion techniques and who care for vascular access devices amongst other competing clinical tasks. However, this conclusion may change once the one study awaiting classification and one ongoing study are published. There is a need for good-quality RCTs to evaluate the efficacy of a vascular access specialist team approach for vascular access device insertion and care for the prevention of failure.","Carr, Peter J; Higgins, Niall S; Cooke, Marie L; Mihala, Gabor; Rickard, Claire M",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd011429.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29558570/,21

112503,Simultaneous PET/MRI Imaging During Mouse Cerebral Hypoxia-ischemia.,2015,"AIM To assess factors influencing glycaemic control following gastric bypass surgery in patients with Type 2 diabetes and BMI< 30 kg/m(2) . METHODS Prospective longitudinal study of 103 patients with inadequate glycaemic control who underwent gastric bypass surgery at Soonchunhyang University, Seoul, Korea (n = 66) and Min-Sheng General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan (n = 37). Procedures were performed August 2009 to January 2011. Key outcome measures were excellent glycaemic control of Type 2 diabetes defined as HbA1c < 42 mmol/mol (≤6%); inadequate response defined as HbA1c > 53 mmol/mol (> 7%). Analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression, and cut-points obtained from receiver operator characteristics. RESULTS Excellent glycaemic control was achieved in 31 (30%) at 1 year. Diabetes duration of < 7 years and BMI > 27 kg/m(2) provided independent predictors and useful cut-points. Likelihood of excellent glycaemic control for an individual could be estimated using loge (Odds) = -6.7 + (0.26 × BMI) + (-1.2 × diabetes duration). Baseline BMI of < 27 kg/m(2) and baseline C-peptide of < 2.0ng/ml, best predicted a poor glycaemic response. In those with favourable baseline characteristics percentage weight loss (%WL) had a dominant influence on glycaemic outcomes. Baseline C-peptide (> 2.4 ng/ml) and subsequent percentage weight loss (> 16%) were associated with excellent glycaemic control. Higher BMI was associated with greater percentage weight loss. CONCLUSION In patients with Type 2 diabetes and BMI < 30 kg/m(2) , glycaemic response to gastric bypass is predicted by higher baseline BMI, shorter disease duration and higher fasting C-peptide. Post-surgery weight loss has a dominant effect. Baseline BMI and weight loss have a major influence on outcomes.","Dixon, J B; Hur, K-Y; Lee, W-J; Kim, M-J; Chong, K; Chen, S-C; Straznicky, N-E; Zimmet, P",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.12107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23278432/,21

INTRODUCTION Tracheostomy tubes accumulate biofilms, which may limit their lifespan. Frequent cleaning of the tubes is a method for biofilm prevention. Cleaning practices vary widely. Some families prefer dishwashing of tubes, but its effects are currently unknown. We hypothesize that dishwashing has no significant effect on the physical properties of tracheostomy tubes and can be recommended as a safe way to clean tracheostomy tubes. METHODS Twenty 4.0 Shiley™ pediatric tracheostomy tubes were randomly assigned into dishwashed (DW) and non-dishwashed (NDW) groups, 10/group. DW tubes were subjected to 12 wash cycles. Each tube's hardness along with the surface spectra were analyzed to assess for chemical composition changes. Three cannula samples from each group were also randomly assessed with scanning-electron microscopy and scored by blinded examiners to assess for changes in surface heterogeneity. RESULTS Hardness testing revealed a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0009) between the NDW and the DW group indicating increased fragility in the dishwashed tubes. Spectral analysis revealed loss of plasticizers, indicating decreased flexibility. Blinded electron microscopy scoring revealed increased surface heterogeneity in the DW group (p = 0.00007). CONCLUSION A significant decrease in tube hardness and increased surface heterogeneity were found with dishwashing. The spectral analysis demonstrated increasing fragility. We believe these effects could potentially lead to decreased mechanical safety. With increased surface heterogeneity there is a greater potential for biofilm formation. At this time, dishwashing cannot be recommended as a tracheostomy tube cleaning method.","Smolar, David E; Ho, Brian; Kent, Steven M; Hughes, C Anthony; Mettenburg, Donald; Rueggeberg, Fredrick A; Groves, Michael W",International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2017.06.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28802395/,21
113420,"DMCCB Basel Symposium on 'Targeting RNA by Small Molecules' Online, 4th February, 2021.",2021-05-28,"INTRODUCTION Since the beginning of the HIV epidemic in resource-rich countries, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PjP) is one of the most frequent opportunistic AIDS-defining infections. The Collaboration of Observational HIV Epidemiological Research Europe (COHERE) has shown that primary Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (PjP) prophylaxis can be safely withdrawn in patients with CD4 counts of 100 to 200 cells/µL if plasma HIV-RNA is suppressed on combination antiretroviral therapy. Whether this holds true for secondary prophylaxis is not known, and this has proved difficult to determine due to the much lower population at risk. METHODS We estimated the incidence of secondary PjP by including patient data collected from 1998 to 2015 from the COHERE cohort collaboration according to time-updated CD4 counts, HIV-RNA and use of PjP prophylaxis in persons >16 years of age. We fitted a Poisson generalized additive model in which the smoothed effect of CD4 was modelled by a restricted cubic spline, and HIV-RNA was stratified as low (<400), medium (400 to 10,000) or high (>10,000copies/mL). RESULTS There were 373 recurrences of PjP during 74,295 person-years (py) in 10,476 patients. The PjP incidence in the different plasma HIV-RNA strata differed significantly and was lowest in the low stratum. For patients off prophylaxis with CD4 counts between 100 and 200 cells/µL and HIV-RNA below 400 copies/mL, the incidence of recurrent PjP was 3.9 (95% CI: 2.0 to 5.8) per 1000 py, not significantly different from patients on prophylaxis in the same stratum (1.9, 95% CI: 0.1 to 3.7). CONCLUSIONS HIV viraemia importantly affects the risk of recurrent PjP. In virologically suppressed patients on ART with CD4 counts of 100 to 200/µL, the incidence of PjP off prophylaxis is below 10/1000 py. Secondary PjP prophylaxis may be safely withheld in such patients. While European guidelines recommend discontinuing secondary PjP prophylaxis only if CD4 counts rise above 200 cells/mL, the latest US Guidelines consider secondary prophylaxis discontinuation even in patients with a CD4 count above 100 cells/µL and suppressed viral load. Our results strengthen and support this US recommendation.","Atkinson, Andrew; Miro, Jose M; Mocroft, Amanda; Reiss, Peter; Kirk, Ole; Morlat, Philippe; Ghosn, Jade; Stephan, Christoph; Mussini, Cristina; Antoniadou, Anastasia; Doerholt, Katja; Girardi, Enrico; De Wit, Stéphane; Kraus, David; Zwahlen, Marcel; Furrer, Hansjakob",Journal of the International AIDS Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118121/,21

However, their decision-making during this process is not well understood. In this article, we use an ecological approach to explore talent identification in combat sports. We interviewed twenty-four expert, international-level coaches from the Olympic disciplines of boxing, judo, and taekwondo (age: 48.7 + 7.5 years; experience: 20.8 + 8.3 years). Findings indicated that when coaches identify talent they rely on ""gut instinct"": intuitive judgements made without conscious thought, used to direct attention to particular athletes or characteristics. Our analysis revealed four major contributors to coaches' intuition: experiential knowledge, temporal factors, seeing athletes in context, and what can be worked with. Our findings demonstrate that i) athlete selections may be influenced by the coaches' perceived ability to improve certain athletes (rather than solely on athlete ability); and ii) ""instinctual"" decisions are the result of years of experience, time spent with the athlete, and the context surrounding the decision. Based on these findings, we recommend that future research focuses on the duration and conditions that are required for coaches to confidently and reliably identify talented athletes.","Roberts, Alexandra H; Greenwood, Daniel; Stanley, Mandy; Humberstone, Clare; Iredale, Fiona; Raynor, Annette",Journal of sports sciences,https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2020.1823083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962508/,21

Advances in diagnostic techniques have increasingly allowed the identification of lung abnormalities in patients previously labelled as having primary spontaneous pneumothorax, a group in whom recommended management differs from those with clinically apparent lung disease. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying pneumothorax are now better understood and this may have implications for clinical management. Risk stratification of patients at baseline could help to identify subgroups at higher risk of recurrent pneumothorax who would benefit from early intervention to prevent recurrence.

115123,Assessing Therapeutic Angiogenesis in a Murine Model of Hindlimb Ischemia.,2019,"BACKGROUND Particularly for protracted bleeding situations, the realization of a relevant blood loss is necessary for early initiation of therapy to avoid hemodynamic instability and shock. The frequently used visual assessment of blood loss is known to be incorrect. An innovative option to address this problem is a mobile application using colorimetric image correction and analysis. METHODS The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical applicability and accuracy of a novel mobile device application using colorimetric image correction and analysis for blood loss estimation. Scenarios of blood-filled surgical sponges were created to evaluate the accuracy of colorimetric-based blood loss estimation and visual and gravimetric blood loss estimation. RESULTS Fifty-three anesthesiologists ran through the scenarios. The estimated blood loss correlated the least with the reference blood loss in the visual technique (Rho: 0.52; p < 3.7*10), followed by the gravimetric technique (Rho: 0.73; p = 2.8*10). The best correlation was found in the colorimetric blood loss measurement (Rho: 0.77; p = 3.53*10). A median overestimation per scenario of 133.0 ml (IQR 33.0-283.0 ml) was observed when using the visual method, whereas 32.5 ml (IQR 10.8-44.0 ml) was overestimated with the gravimetric method and 31 ml (IQR 17.0 - 42.8 ml) with the colorimetric method. Especially in the case of blood loss underestimation, the application has the least deviation from the reference. CONCLUSION The blood loss measured in the sponges correlated strong with the reference blood loss, showing the smallest median overestimation and the smallest deviation in underestimation. The visual estimation shows serious errors, where the gravimetric method is prone to errors, especially in dilution. The colorimetric method offers an easily implementable possibility to monitor blood loss in real-time and to initiate early diagnostic and therapeutic measures in case of persistent blood loss. The influence of real-time estimation of colorimetric blood loss on transfusion decisions should be the subject of future studies.","Piekarski, Florian; Gerdessen, Lara; Schmitt, Elke; Friedrichson, Benjamin; Neef, Vanessa; Meybohm, Patrick; Zacharowski, Kai; Raimann, Florian J; Wunderer, Florian",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000001615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32694398/,21
116136,Generation of Recombinant Vaccinia Viruses.,2017,"BACKGROUND Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has proven to be a valuable alternative to conventional surgical aortic valve replacement in high risk and surgically in operable patients who suffer from severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. However, a significant number of complications, associated with both the learning curve and device specificity, have required attention and subsequent improvement. The Symetis transapical TAVR system is a self-positioning bioprosthesis composed of a non-coronary leaflet of surgical quality porcine tissue valve sewn into a self-expanding nitinol stent that iscovered with a PET-skirt. METHODS From June to September 2013 six patients have been operated on severe aortic stenosis using the new TAVR device. All patients have undergone critical assessment of a local Heart Team and have been disqualified from conventional AVR. Five were woman. Mean age was 82.3 ± 2.0 (mean LogEuroScore 23.9 ± 14.3). Four patients suffered from coronary artery disease - two had history of previous percutaneous coronary intervention with intracoronary stents, while the next two had history of coronary artery bypass grafting. Diabetes was frequent (n = 3) as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 4). Carotid artery disease was encountered in three patients similarly to atrial fibrillation. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 51.5 ± 11.8%, but one patient had suffered from low-flow-low-gradient aortic stenosis with LVEF of 29%. RESULTS The procedure was carried out successfully in all six cases. Two patients have received the valve sized L, three - M and one - S. Mean procedure time was 180 ± 19 min, mean cine 7.2 ± 1.2 min. Mean X-ray dose 930 ± 439 mGy, while mean volume of contrast given was 135 ± 61 mL. In all patients but one perivalvular leak (PVL) was not present. One patient had trace of PVL. Also, good LVEF was noted in all patients. Similar findings were obtained 30 days post procedure. No strokes, transient ischaemic attack or other cerebrovascular incidents were observed. CONCLUSIONS This brief clinical communication reports the first Polish experience with the second generation of TAVR device - the Symetis Acurate Transapical Aortic Valve. While it lacks large patient population and longer follow-up, it reveals that TAVR procedure can be performed safely, with minimal X-ray exposure time and contrast given and successfully - with almost nonexistent PVL and no cerebrovascular incidents or heart rhythm disturbances. Heart Team approach is vital, and transapical access should not be treated inferiorly, but rather as an equally appealing TAVR option.","Zembala, Michał Oskar; Piegza, Jacek; Wacławski, Jacek; Hawranek, Michał; Hilker, Michael; Niklewski, Tomasz; Głowacki, Jan; Parys, Monika; Nadziakiewicz, Paweł; Chodór, Piotr; Wilczek, Krzysztof; Przybylski, Roman; Gąsior, Mariusz; Zembala, Marian",Kardiologia polska,https://doi.org/10.5603/kp.2014.0029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604504/,21

Traditional arrays require direct implantation into the brain via open craniotomy, which can lead to inflammatory tissue responses, necessitating development of minimally invasive approaches that avoid brain trauma. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of chronically recording brain activity from within a vein using a passive stent-electrode recording array (stentrode). We achieved implantation into a superficial cortical vein overlying the motor cortex via catheter angiography and demonstrate neural recordings in freely moving sheep for up to 190 d.

116857,Mass spectrometry-based absolute quantification of amyloid proteins in pathology tissue specimens: Merits and limitations.,2020,"BACKGROUND The WHO recommends testing any suspected person with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), in order to limit the spread of the epidemic. In Italy, some Regions opted for extensive testing, whereas others limited tests to selected subjects. To assess the influence of different strategies, we examined the incidence of death and severe cases in Italy. METHODS Data on new cases of SARS-CoV-2, number of tests, deaths, and admissions to Intensive Care Units (ICU) were retrieved in each Italian Region, from February 24th to March 18th , 2020. As an index of different screening strategies, the number of tests/positive test results (P/T) ratio as of March 7th , 2020, was considered. The cumulative number of deaths and of new severe cases, between March 23th and 25th was recorded. The association of those two outcomes with the number of P/T ratio was assessed using linear regression models. RESULTS In the interval between March 23th -25th , recorded deaths (*million inhabitants) were 14(3-54), whereas severe cases were 31(10-112). Both the number of deaths and that of severe cases showed a significant correlation (R2 .57 and .41, with p<.01) with the P/T ratio. Deaths and severe cases were associated with higher mean personal income and lower density of General Practioners (GPs). The association of P/T with severe cases and deaths retained statistical significance after adjusting for mean personal income (R2 .30 and .41, respectively; both p=.04) and GPs density (R2 .21 and .19, respectively; both p=.03). CONCLUSIONS A more aggressive screening strategy for SARS-Cov-2, was associated with lower rates of death and severe disease in Regions of Italy.","Mannucci, Edoardo; Silverii, Antonio; Monami, Matteo",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33236474/,21

Access to the retroperitoneal space is obtained using a balloon-dilating device. Ports include a 12-mm camera port, two 8-mm robotic ports and a 12-mm assistant port placed in the anterior axillary line cephalad to the anterior superior iliac spine, and 7-8 cm caudal to the ipsilateral robotic port. RESULTS Positioning and port placement strategies for successful technique include: (i) Docking robot directly over the patient's head parallel to the spine; (ii) incision for camera port ≈1.9 cm (1 fingerbreadth) above the iliac crest, lateral to the triangle of Petit; (iii) Seldinger technique insertion of kidney-shaped balloon dilator into retroperitoneal space; (iv) Maximising distance between all ports; (v) Ensuring camera arm is placed in the outer part of the 'sweet spot'.

Between April 30th, 2020 and May 28th, 2020, we evaluated self-reported changes in recent smoking patterns and motivation to quit smoking among current daily cigarette smokers (N = 103) on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We also assessed the relationship of these outcomes to age, medical comorbidity status, and fear of COVID-19. Most participants (68.9%) reported smoking less frequently than usual in the last 28 days. Among daily smokers, increased fear of COVID-19 predicted increased motivation to quit smoking and actual smoking reductions (ps < .05). Endorsement of one or more medical comorbidities, but not increased age, predicted increased motivation to quit smoking (p < .05). These data suggest the potentially greater relevance of psychological factors (e.g., fear of COVID-19) over external risk factors (e.g., medical comorbidity, increased age) on motivation to quit smoking and actual reductions in smoking patterns, and may reflect that the pandemic is a suitable time for offering smoking cessation intervention.","Gold, Alexandra K; Hoyt, Danielle L; Milligan, Megan; Hiserodt, Michele L; Samora, Jake; Leyro, Teresa M; Zvolensky, Michael J; Otto, Michael W",Cognitive behaviour therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2021.1877340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605833/,21

This technique is usually employed in the setting of critical limb ischemia and tibial artery intervention, but it may offer potential practical advantages for popliteal artery and even superficial femoral artery intervention in unique situations. As in all cases of lower extremity arterial intervention, consideration of access is important not only for initial approach to any obstructing lesion but also for exit strategy. The dorsalis pedis artery and posterior tibial artery can be readily accessed if necessary owing to their relatively superficial position in the foot or the ankle, yet their normal diameter and the presence of significant calcification (a common finding in patients with tibial occlusive disease and critical limb ischemia) can pose difficulties as well. In addition, the peroneal artery in the lower leg can be accessed percutaneously; however, its size and depth may present additional challenges. Meticulous attention to detail is paramount in avoiding complications in what may be the only distal vessel supplying the foot. This article describes common techniques in using tibiopedal artery access as a means of alternative access for successful infrainguinal intervention.","Wiechmann, Bret N",Techniques in vascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.tvir.2014.08.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241320/,21
120014,Characterization of protein-DNA interactions using protein microarrays.,2011,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in fomites which suggests the virus could be transmitted via inanimate objects. However, there is uncertainty about the mechanistic pathway for such transmissions. Our objective was to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from primary studies and systematic reviews assessing the role of fomites in transmission. Methods: This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We conduct ongoing searches using WHO Covid-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, and Google Scholar; assess study quality based on five criteria and report important findings on an ongoing basis. Results: We found 64 studies: 63 primary studies and one systematic review (n=35). The settings for primary studies were predominantly in hospitals (69.8%) including general wards, ICU and SARS-CoV-2 isolation wards. There were variations in the study designs including timing of sample collection, hygiene procedures, ventilation settings and cycle threshold. The overall quality of reporting was low to moderate. The frequency of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests across 51 studies (using RT-PCR) ranged from 0.5% to 75%. Cycle threshold values ranged from 20.8 to 44.1. Viral concentrations were reported in 17 studies; however, discrepancies in the methods for estimation prevented comparison. Eleven studies (17.5%) attempted viral culture, but none found a cytopathic effect. Results of the systematic review showed that healthcare settings were most frequently tested (25/35, 71.4%), but laboratories reported the highest frequency of contaminated surfaces (20.5%, 17/83). Conclusions: The majority of studies report identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on inanimate surfaces; however, there is a lack of evidence demonstrating the recovery of viable virus. Lack of positive viral cultures and variation in cycle thresholds create uncertainty about fomites as a mode of transmission. Heterogeneity in study designs and methodology prevents comparisons of findings across studies. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting research on fomite transmission is warranted.","Onakpoya, Igho J; Heneghan, Carl J; Spencer, Elizabeth A; Brassey, Jon; Plüddemann, Annette; Evans, David H; Conly, John M; Jefferson, Tom",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.51590.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34136133/,21

METHODS Experimental study. Vancomycin 1 mg/0.1 mL, ceftazidime 2 mg/0.1 mL, and moxifloxacin 160 μg/0.1 mL were compounded and prepared in 1-mL polypropylene syringes and stored at 4 °C, -20 °C, and -80 °C. Antibiotic potency, sterility, pH, osmolality, and concentration were tested at baseline and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after preparation. RESULTS Potency, sterility, and stability were preserved for all 3 antibiotics at all temperatures out to 24 weeks, although there was a trend toward reduced potency at Week 24 for vancomycin and ceftazidime stored at 4°C. The largest zones of inhibition for Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus were consistently demonstrated by moxifloxacin. CONCLUSION Vancomycin, ceftazidime, and moxifloxacin prepared in single-use polypropylene syringes retain potency, sterility, and stability out to 24 weeks when stored at -20 °C or -80 °C.

METHODS We selected three collective catering companies that offered ~53 500 menus/d in 369 schools in Spain's Mediterranean area (Valencian Community). The study included four public schools with different management models as well as different supply patterns. Considering the weight of the servings, the caloric contribution of the menus was estimated. RESULTS Great diversity was seen both in the same school throughout the week and between the four schools (School 1: 298-946 kcal; School 2: 465-1185 kcal; School 3: 395-656 kcal; and School 4: 374-966 kcal). The energy intake from carbohydrates complied with the recommendations in three of the four schools, the energy provided from proteins was adequate in all of the schools, and the energy from lipids was higher than the recommended values in Schools 1 and 2, lower in School 3, and compliant in School 4. The most abundant fatty acids in the menus were oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acids. The sodium content in the rated menus was 229 ± 72 mg/100 g. The highest salt content came from menus that included a precooked dish, processed meat, or both. CONCLUSION It is necessary to review school menus and adjust the size of the servings to the age of the children. Correct nutritional education is essential for both kitchen staff and school canteen monitors.","Lavall, Maria J; Blesa, Jesus; Frigola, Ana; Esteve, Maria J",Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.110872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645623/,21

The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the potential of (18)F-FDG PET to discriminate metastatic disease from second primary lung tumours. METHODS Of 1,396 patients evaluated by the thoracic oncology group between January 2004 and April 2009 at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, patients with a synchronous second primary lung cancer were selected. Patients with metastatic disease involving the lungs served as the control group. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) measured with (18)F-FDG PET were determined for two tumours in each patient. The relative difference between the SUVs of these tumours (∆SUV) was determined and compared between the second primary group and metastatic disease group. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the ∆SUV for an optimal cut-off value. RESULTS A total of 37 patients (21 metastatic disease, 16 second primary cancer) were included for analysis. The ∆SUV was significantly higher in patients with second primary cancer than in those with metastatic disease (58 vs 28%, respectively, p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve was 0.81 and the odds ratio for the optimal cut-off was 18.4. CONCLUSION SUVs from (18)F-FDG PET images can be helpful in differentiating metastatic disease from second primary tumours in patients with synchronous pulmonary lesions. Further studies are warranted to confirm the consistency of these results.","Dijkman, Bernadette G; Schuurbiers, Olga C J; Vriens, Dennis; Looijen-Salamon, Monika; Bussink, Johan; Timmer-Bonte, Johanna N H; Snoeren, Miranda M; Oyen, Wim J G; van der Heijden, Henricus F M; de Geus-Oei, Lioe-Fee",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-010-1505-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20533031/,21

Because most centers performing IAT use noncontrast CT (NCCT) imaging, it is critical to understand the impact of NCCT findings on treatment outcomes. This study aimed to compare functional independence and safety among patients undergoing intra-arterial treatment stratified by the extent of ischemic change on pretreatment NCCT. METHODS The study cohort was derived from multicenter trials of the Penumbra System. Inclusion criteria were anterior circulation proximal occlusion, evaluable pretreatment NCCT, and known time to reperfusion. Ischemic change was quantified using the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) and stratified into 3 prespecified groups for comparison: 0 to 4 (most ischemic change) versus 5 to 7 versus 8 to 10 (least ischemic change). RESULTS A total of 249 patients were analyzed: 40 with ASPECTS 0 to 4, 83 with ASPECTS 5 to 7, and 126 with ASPECTS 8 to 10. For ASPECTS 0 to 4, 5 to 7, and 8 to 10, respectively, good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) rates were 5%, 38.6%, and 46% (P<0.0001), and mortality rates were 55%, 28.9%, and 19% (P=0.0001). The only significant pairwise differences were between ASPECTS 0 to 4 and other groups. Symptomatic hemorrhage was more common with lower ASPECTS (P=0.02). Shorter time to reperfusion was significantly associated with better outcomes among patients with ASPECTS 8 to 10 (P=0.01). A similar relationship was seen for ASPECTS 5 to 7 but was not statistically significant. No such relationship was seen for ASPECTS 0 to 4. CONCLUSIONS NCCT seems useful for excluding patients with the greatest burden of ischemic damage from futile intra-arterial treatment, which is unlikely to result in patient functional independence and increases the risk of hemorrhage.","Yoo, Albert J; Zaidat, Osama O; Chaudhry, Zeshan A; Berkhemer, Olvert A; González, R Gilberto; Goyal, Mayank; Demchuk, Andrew M; Menon, Bijoy K; Mualem, Elan; Ueda, Dawn; Buell, Hope; Sit, Siu Po; Bose, Arani",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.113.004260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503670/,21

Whereas iMPM of malignant disease has been performed for soft tissues, noninvasive iMPM of solid tumor in the bone is lacking. We combined miniaturized tissue-engineered bone constructs in nude mice with a skin window to noninvasively and repetitively monitor prostate cancer lesions by three-dimensional iMPM. In vivo ossicles developed large central cavities containing mature bone marrow surrounded by a thin cortex and enabled tumor implantation and longitudinal iMPM over weeks. Tumors grew inside the bone cavity and along the cortical bone interface and induced niches of osteoclast activation (focal osteolysis). Interventional bisphosphonate therapy reduced osteoclast kinetics and osteolysis without perturbing tumor growth, indicating dissociation of the tumor-stroma axis. The ossicle window, with its high cavity-to-cortex ratio and long-term functionality, thus allows for the mechanistic dissection of reciprocal epithelial tumor-bone interactions and therapy response.","Dondossola, Eleonora; Alexander, Stephanie; Holzapfel, Boris M; Filippini, Stefano; Starbuck, Michael W; Hoffman, Robert M; Navone, Nora; De-Juan-Pardo, Elena M; Logothetis, Christopher J; Hutmacher, Dietmar W; Friedl, Peter",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aao5726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30068572/,21

Major weight-bearing joints are affected most. However, possible effects on trunk muscle activity have not been examined so far. The objective of this work was to study consequences of haemarthropathy on characteristics of trunk muscles in PWH while standing on surfaces with different mechanical properties. METHODS Surface EMG of internal oblique (IO) and multifidus (MF) muscles were bilaterally recorded during a natural bilateral stance in 20 PWH with severe haemophilia A [age: 42 years (SD: 10)] and 25 non-haemophilic controls [NHC, 43 (12)]. Amplitude ratios, a symmetry index between sides and the co-activation ratio of IO over MF served as outcome measures and compared standing on three different surfaces (stable, soft, unsteady). RESULTS PWH revealed markedly restricted lower extremity joints (P < 0.001), but without any hint of back pain. Neither result revealed significant main or interaction effects of 'group' (P > 0.24). Group-independent analyses showed amplitude ratios (MF: P < 0.05) as well as symmetry indices (MF: P < 0.02) significantly altered by 'surface' in NHC only. Effects of utilizing soft vs. unsteady surfaces were not detectable (P > 0.77). CONCLUSION Utilizing unstable surfaces does not lead to altered trunk muscle activity in PWH. Differently than expected, a quite similar behaviour of lower trunk muscles in terms of applied indices can be found in PWH and NHC. Ascending alterations of muscle coordination in PWH could not be verified.","Kurz, E; Herbsleb, M; Grassme, R; Anders, C; Hilberg, T",Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia,https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.13037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27457342/,21

MATERIALS AND METHODS The PubMed Database was extensively searched for articles describing Portal Vein Stenosis (PVS) as a complication in Liver Transplant (LT) patients. The initial database search yielded 488 unique records published in the PubMed Database, 19 of which were deemed to meet the inclusion criteria. Outcomes were separated into 2 groups (Group A included patients with primary angioplasty, Group B included patients with primary stent placement), and further subdivided into Adult and Pediatric populations. RESULTS Group A included a total of 282 LT patients with portal vein stenosis. The population was predominantly pediatric (n = 243). Group B included a total of 111 LT patients with portal vein stenosis. This population was predominantly adult (n = 66). Technical success was significantly higher in both Group B pediatric (100%) and adults (97%) compared to Group A (69.5%) and (66.7%) respectively. Re-stenosis rates were significantly lower in Group B pediatric group compared to Group A (2.3% vs 29.7%, χ2 = 13.9; p < 0.001). Overall major (3.1%) and minor complications rates (1.5%) were low. CONCLUSION Primary stent placement appears to have higher technical success in both populations and lower re-stenosis rates for treatment of PVS in pediatric populations.","Sare, Antony; Chandra, Vishnu; Shanmugasundaram, Srinidhi; Shukla, Pratik A; Kumar, Abhishek",Vascular and endovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1538574421994417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33618615/,21

We determined the appropriate use of PPC to preclude subsequent small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) retention. METHODS This prospective multicenter study consecutively enrolled patients indicated for SBCE with suspected or established small bowel stenosis. Excretion of an intact PPC or its radiologic visualization in the large bowel was considered GI patency. Primary and secondary study endpoints were SBCE retention rates in patients with confirmed patency and identification of factors associated with patency and SBCE retention, respectively. RESULTS Of 1,096 patients enrolled in the study, patency was confirmed in 976 (89.1%). PPC excretion occurred in 579 patients. Of the remaining 517 patients, patency was confirmed using imaging modalities in 401 (77.5%). SBCE retention occurred in five (0.51%) of 963 patients who underwent SBCE: 1.0% in established Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 0% in suspected CD, 0% in tumors, and 1.6% in patients with obscure GI bleeding, for which PPC localization had been radiographically misinterpreted. The non-confirmation of patency was associated with established CD, stenosis identified using imaging modalities, abdominal fullness, serum albumin levels <4.0 g/dL, and previous small bowel obstruction (adjusted odds ratios: 4.21, 2.60, 2.47, 2.12, and 2.00; 95% confidence intervals: 2.62-6.78, 1.62-4.17, 1.43-4.27, 1.32-3.40, and 1.15-3.47, respectively).

SETTING Acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital. PARTICIPANTS Fifty-five patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation for new-onset TBI (69.1% male; mean age = 37 years, SD = 14 years). DESIGN Cross-sectional, secondary data analysis. MAIN MEASURES BTACT; California Verbal Learning Test-second edition (CVLT-2); Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) Digit Span; Trail Making Test; semantic fluency; phonemic fluency; Symbol Digit Modalities Test; Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. RESULTS The BTACT was significantly associated with established neuropsychological tests across composite scores of overall cognition (r = 0.64, P < .001), episodic verbal memory (r = 0.66, P < .001), and executive function (r = 0.56, P < .001). For BTACT subtests, Word List Immediate Recall and Word List Delayed Recall were correlated with CVLT-2 learning trials total score (r = 0.57, P < .01) and long delay free recall (r = 0.60, P < .001), respectively. BTACT Digits Backward correlated with WAIS-IV Digit Span (r = 0.51, P < .01).

125907,"Design and evaluation of sifuvirtide, a novel HIV-1 fusion inhibitor.",2008,"AIM Asphyxiated neonates should be resuscitated with air, but it remains unclear if oxygen supplementation is needed in ineffectively ventilated newborn infants. We studied the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) with oxygen or air in an experimental model of inadequate ventilation. METHODS Asphyxia was induced in 16 newborn piglets until their heart rate was <60 bpm or mean arterial pressure (MAP) <30 mmHg. During the first 10 minutes of resuscitation, they received one breath per minute of oxygen (n = 8) or air (n = 8). Tidal volume was 7.5 mL/kg. If MAP was <30 mmHg for 15 seconds, closed-chest cardiac massage (CCCM) was performed for 45 seconds. From 10 minutes onward, all piglets received normal ventilation with air. ROSC was defined as a heart rate >150 bpm, MAP >40 mmHg and no subsequent CCCM. RESULTS Before resuscitation, the median arterial pH was 6.73. At 10 minutes, no piglets in the oxygen group needed CCCM, while all did in the air group (p < 0.001). The median time to ROSC was 60 seconds with oxygen and 845 seconds with air (p < 0.001). No brain tissue hyperoxia occurred. CONCLUSION When ventilation was inadequate, one oxygen breath reduced time to ROSC in piglets with severe metabolic and respiratory acidosis.","Linner, Rikard; Cunha-Goncalves, Doris; Perez-de-Sa, Valeria",Acta paediatrica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.13920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28513002/,21

AIM To evaluate the impact of the pandemic and the access to health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the transgender people living in Italy. METHODS An anonymous web-based survey was conducted among transgender people living in Italy. OUTCOMES The survey consisted of 41 questions (to address socio-demographic and COVID-19 related variables, general health problems and trans-related health issues) and three validated questionnaires (the Impact of Event Scale [IES], the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI-II] and the SF-12. RESULTS In total 108 respondents were included in the analysis, of these 73.1% were transmen and 26.9% transwomen. The mean age was 34.3 ± 11.7 years with 88.9% undergoing gender affirming hormonal treatment (GAHT). Of these respondents 55.6% were not working during the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly because they lost their jobs due to the lockdown (30.5%) or because they were otherwise unemployed (25.0%). Only four subjects were quarantined at home because of a positive COVID-19 swab. The mean total IES score was 21.1 ± 14.9 with 24.1% of subjects scoring over the cut-off score of 26 thereby suggesting a moderate-to-severe impact of the pandemic event. Mean BDI score was 8.6 ± 8.4. SF-12 total mean score was 96.1 ± 11.9 with a Mental Component Summary (MCS) score of 42.8 ± 9.1. Access to endocrinological consultations for hormonal prescription via telemedicine services was associated with better IES total scores (P = .01). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Our results highlight the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of this particular population and how telemedicine services may serve to mitigate negative psychological effects. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS Internet-based surveys may select a group of people not necessary representative of the whole population. The self-reporting bias should also be considered. Those who responded to our survey were mainly from northern Italy were COVID-19 has had a greater impact. CONCLUSION Vulnerable groups such as the transgender population should receive more consideration also during pandemic events and their access to health services especially for endocrine and mental health care should be improved. A nationwide plan for the extended use of telemedicine should be established with targeted intervention to reduce psychological distress. Gava G, Fisher AD, Alvisi S, et al.

127611,"Is hand, foot and mouth disease associated with meteorological parameters?",2010,"This study examines the effect of Income Support Programs (ISPs) on job search effort, work- place mobility, COVID-19 cases, and mortality growth rates. To identify ISPs' causal effect, I use the variation in their introductions' timing across countries and implement a difference-in-difference and multi-event analysis method. I find that ISPs led to a 4.4-8.29 percentage points reduction in workplace mobility and a 6.6-11.6 percentage points reduction in job search effort levels. They also caused a 21.8-47.7 and 17.1-29.7 percentage points reduction in the COVID-19 case growth rate and COVID-19 mortality growth rates, respectively. Using the event analysis estimates, I simulated the counterfactual job search effort, workplace mobility, and the number of COVID-19 cases and mortality without income support programs. The average global job search effort and workplace mobility without ISPs would have been 11.12 and 9.26 percent higher than the observed mean job search effort and workplace mobility. However, these would have come at the cost of 3.69 million and 166, 690 additional COVID-19 cases and mortality than the cases and deaths registered by May 15th.","Asfaw, Abraham Abebe",Economics and human biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2021.100997; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33813156/,21

Maxwell suggested that a cluster of particles embedded in an infinite medium subjected to a uniform electrical field has the same far-field asymptotic as an equivalent sphere whose conductivity is equal to the effective one; this yields closed-form formula for the effective conductivity.

INTRODUCTION Student engagement is critical to facilitating academic success and significant learning experiences for undergraduate nursing students. However, students from diverse backgrounds face challenges in undergraduate nursing programs, and these challenges impact their academic engagement and sense of belonging and inclusion. Creating conditions in nursing education that foster engagement by meeting the learning needs of diverse learners could facilitate their success, which ultimately might strengthen the nursing workforce diversity. INCLUSION CRITERIA This review will consider papers on how educators engage undergraduate nursing students from diverse backgrounds in classroom settings, including online, face-to-face, and blended formats, irrespective of the country. Evidence obtained from all sources including qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies, systematic reviews, as well as gray literature will be considered for inclusion. METHODS JBI methodology for scoping reviews, which includes a three-step search strategy, will be employed. First, keywords will be identified from relevant articles in CINAHL and ERIC. Second, another search using the identified keywords and index terms across select databases will be conducted. Third, the reference lists of all identified articles will be screened for additional papers. Titles and abstracts will be screened by two independent reviewers, and then followed by the full text review of included articles against the inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers. Data will be extracted from included articles and the findings will be presented in tables, figures, and narratively as appropriate.

129961,"Comparative genomics of the human, macaque and mouse major histocompatibility complex.",2017,"The aim of this study was to observe changes in the kinematics and muscle activities when barefoot running was initially adopted by six habitually shod, recreational rearfoot striking runners. Participants ran on a treadmill shod for 5 min, completed 3 × 10-min intervals of barefoot running and then completed a final minute of shod running at a self-selected pace. Dependent variables (speed, joint angles at foot-contact, joint range of motion (ROM), mean and peak electromyography (EMG) activity) were compared across conditions using repeated measures ANOVAs. Anterior pelvic tilt and hip flexion significantly decreased during barefoot conditions at foot contact. The ROM for the trunk, pelvis, knee and ankle angles decreased during the barefoot conditions. Mean EMG activity was reduced for biceps femoris, gastrocnemius lateralis and tibialis anterior during barefoot running. The peak activity across the running cycle decreased in biceps femoris, vastus medialis, gastrocnemius medialis and tibialis anterior during barefoot running. During barefoot running, tibialis anterior activity significantly decreased during the pre-activation and initial contact phases; gastrocnemius lateralis and medialis activity significantly decreased during the push-off phase. Barefoot running caused immediate biomechanical and neuromuscular adaptations at the hip and pelvis, which persisted when the runners donned their shoes, indicating that some learning had occurred during an initial short bout of barefoot running.","Strauts, Janina; Vanicek, Natalie; Halaki, Mark",Journal of sports sciences,https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2015.1034756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25908260/,21

In particular, NO has potential in treating mechanical device-associated thrombosis due to its ability to reduce platelet activation and due to the central role of platelet activation and adhesion in device thrombosis. Nitrite is a unique NO donor that reduces platelet activation in that it's activity requires the presence of red blood cells whereas NO activity of other NO donors is blunted by red blood cells. Interestingly, we have previously shown that red blood cell mediated inhibition of platelet activation by adenosine diphosophate (ADP) is dramatically enhanced by illumination with far-red light that is likely due to photolysis of red cell surface bound NO congeners. We now report the effects of nitrite, far-red light, and their combination on several measure of blood coagulation using a variety of agonists. We employed turbidity assays in platelet rich plasma, platelet activation using flow cytometry analysis of a fluorescently labeled antibody to the activated platelet fibrinogen binding site, multiplate impedance-based platelet aggregometry, and assessment of platelet adhesion to collagen coated flow-through microslides. In all cases, the combination of far-red light and nitrite treatment decreased measures of coagulation, but in some cases mono-treatment with nitrite or light alone had no effect. Perhaps most relevant to device thrombosis, we observed that platelet adhesions was inhibited by the combination of nitrite and light treatment while nitrite alone and far-red light alone trended to decrease adhesion, but the results were mixed. These results support the potential of combined far-red light and nitrite treatment for preventing thrombosis in extra-corporeal or shallow-tissue depth devices where the far-red light can penetrate. Such a combined treatment could be advantageous due to the localized treatment afforded by far-red light illumination with minimal systemic effects. Given the role of thrombosis in COVID 19, application to treatment of patients infected with SARS Cov-2 might also be considered.","Wajih, Nadeem; Alipour, Elmira; Rigal, Fernando; Zhu, Jiqing; Perlegas, Andreas; Caudell, David L; Kim-Shapiro, Daniel",Nitric oxide : biology and chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.niox.2020.11.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33271226/,21
131607,T7 bacteriophage induced changes of gold nanoparticle morphology: biopolymer capped gold nanoparticles as versatile probes for sensitive plasmonic biosensors.,2014,"Italy was one of the countries most affected by the number of people infected and dead during the first COVID-19 wave. The authors describe the rapid rollout of a population health clinical and organizational response in preparedness and capabilities to support the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian province of Modena. The authors review the processes, the challenges faced, and describe how excess demand for hospital services was successfully mitigated and thus overwhelming the healthcare services avoided the collapse of the local health care system. An analysis of bed occupancy in the region predicted during the first weeks of the epidemic. The SEIR model estimated the number of infected people under different containment measures. Community resources were mobilized to reduce provincial hospitals' burden of care. A population health approach, based on a radical reorganization of the workflow and emergency patient management, was implemented. The bed saturation of the Modena Healthcare Agency was measured by an ad hoc, newly implemented intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy and COVID-19 centralized governance dashboard. ICU bed occupancy increased by 114%, avoiding saturation of the Modena Healthcare Agency system. The Emilia-Romagna region achieved a higher rate of ICU bed availability at 2.15 ICU beds per 10,000 inhabitants as compared with community 1 ICU bed availability prior to the pandemic. Rapid and radical local reorganization of regional efforts helped inform the successful development and implementation of strategic choices within the hospital and the community to prevent the saturation of key facilities.","Romani, Gabriele; Dal Mas, Francesca; Massaro, Maurizio; Cobianchi, Lorenzo; Modenese, Mirko; Barcellini, Amelia; Ricciardi, Walter; Barach, Paul; Lucà, Rossella; Ferrara, Maria",Population health management,https://doi.org/10.1089/pop.2020.0255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33373536/,21

METHODS We conducted an observational study using data from our local thrombolysis registry. We included consecutive stroke patients with MRI (3T)-based IVT and a follow-up MRI the next day between 2008 and 2017 (n = 396). Only CMBs located outside of the ischemic lesions were considered. We also performed a meta-analysis on new CMBs after IVT that included 2 additional studies. RESULTS In our cohort, new remote CMBs occurred in 16/396 patients (4.0%) after IVT and the distribution was strictly lobar in 13/16 patients (81%). Patients with preexisting CMBs with a strictly lobar distribution were significantly more likely to have new CMBs after IVT (p = 0.014). In the random-effects meta-analysis (n = 741), the pooled cumulative frequency of new CMBs after IVT was 4.4%. A higher preexisting CMB burden (>2) was associated with a higher likelihood of new CMBs (odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-10.3) and new CMBs were associated with the occurrence of remote parenchymal hemorrhage (OR 28.8, 95% CI 8.6-96.4). CONCLUSIONS New remote CMBs after IVT occurred in 4% of stroke patients, mainly had a strictly lobar distribution, and were associated with IVT-related hemorrhagic complications. Preexisting CMBs with a strictly lobar distribution and a higher CMB burden were associated with new CMBs after IVT, which may indicate an underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy.","Braemswig, Tim Bastian; Villringer, Kersten; Turc, Guillaume; Erdur, Hebun; Fiebach, Jochen B; Audebert, Heinrich J; Endres, Matthias; Nolte, Christian H; Scheitz, Jan F",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000006915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30674591/,21

Here, we aimed to investigate the predictive value of uterine morphological features and microstructural/functional properties of the brain extracted from periovulatory phases for the intensity of menstrual pain as rated by women with PDM during their subsequent menstrual period. Forty-five women with PDM were recruited and classified into the high and mild pain intensity groups. Pelvic MRI was employed to extract the uterine texture features. White matter diffusion properties, grey matter and functional connectivity features were extracted as brain features. Multivariate logistic regression models with iteration optimization were built for classifying different pain intensity groups. Texture features from myometrium and uterine junction zone had outstanding prediction performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.96 (P < 0.05, permutation test), and diffusion properties along the thalamic fiber bundles were the most discriminative features with AUC of 0.95. Applying features from uterus and brain together, we could gain better prediction performance. Our results indicated that accumulated differences in menstrual pain were associated not only with uterine structure but also diffusion properties of thalamic-related fiber tracts, suggesting that treatment options of PDM patients may be expanded from only being able to manage pain in the uterus focusing on the functional/structural modifications of the pain processing system.","Quan, Shilan; Yang, Jing; Dun, Wanghuan; Wang, Ke; Liu, Hongjuan; Liu, Jixin",Brain imaging and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-020-00356-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32705468/,21

Whether IVUS guidance is associated with improved clinical outcomes after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation in an unrestricted patient population is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents (ADAPT-DES) was a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized ""all-comers"" study of 8583 consecutive patients at 11 international centers designed to determine the frequency, timing, and correlates of stent thrombosis and adverse clinical events after DES. Propensity-adjusted multivariable analysis was performed to examine the relationship between IVUS guidance and 1-year outcomes. IVUS was utilized in 3349 patients (39%), and larger-diameter devices, longer stents, and/or higher inflation pressures were used in 74% of IVUS-guided cases. IVUS guidance compared with angiography guidance was associated with reduced 1-year rates of definite/probable stent thrombosis (0.6% [18 events] versus 1.0% [53 events]; adjusted hazard radio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.73; P=0.003), myocardial infarction (2.5% versus 3.7%; adjusted hazard radio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.88; P=0.004), and composite adjudicated major adverse cardiac events (ie, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis) (3.1% versus 4.7%; adjusted hazard radio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.88; P=0.002). The benefits of IVUS were especially evident in patients with acute coronary syndromes and complex lesions, although significant reductions in major adverse cardiac events were present in all patient subgroups those with including stable angina and single-vessel disease. CONCLUSIONS In ADAPT-DES, the largest study of IVUS use to date, IVUS guidance was associated with a reduction in stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and major adverse cardiac events within 1 year after DES implantation.

The mechanism of intestinal barrier injury caused by PRRSV infection in piglets has yet to be investigated. An in vivo PRRSV-induced model was established in 30-day-old piglets by the intramuscular injection of 2 mL of 104 TCID50/mL PRRSV for 15 days. Observations of PRRSV replication and histology were conducted in the lungs and intestine, and goblet cell counts, relative MUC2 mRNA expression, and tight junction protein, proinflammatory cytokine, TLR4, MyD88, IκB and p-IκB expression were measured. PRRSV replicated in the lungs and small intestine, as demonstrated by absolute RT-qPCR quantification, and the PRRSV N protein was detected in the lung interstitium and jejunal mucosa. PRRSV infection induced both lung and gut injury, markedly decreased villus height and the villus to crypt ratio in the small intestine, and obviously increased the number of goblet cells and the relative expression of MUC2 mRNA in the jejunum. PRRSV infection aggravated the morphological depletion of tight junction proteins and increased IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α expression by activating the NF-κB signalling pathway in the jejunum. PRRSV infection impaired intestinal integrity by damaging physical and immune barriers in the intestine by inducing inflammation, which may be related to the regulation of the gut-lung axis. This study also provides a new hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of PRRSV-induced diarrhoea.","Zhao, Jin; Wan, Shuangxiu; Sun, Na; Sun, Panpan; Sun, Yaogui; Khan, Ajab; Guo, Jianhua; Zheng, Xiaozhong; Fan, Kuohai; Yin, Wei; Li, Hongquan",Veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-021-00965-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162433/,21
139762,Pathology of experimental SARS coronavirus infection in cats and ferrets.,2008,"INTRODUCTION The critically-ill undergoing inter-hospital transfers commonly receive sedatives in continuation of their therapeutic regime or to facilitate a safe transfer shielded from external stressors. While sedation assessment is well established in critical care in general, there is only little data available relating to the special conditions during patient transport and their effect on patient sedation levels. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the feasibility and relationship of clinical sedation assessment (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS)) and objective physiological monitoring (bispectral index (BIS)) during patient transfers in our Mobile-ICU. METHODS The levels of sedation of 30 pharmacologically sedated patients were evaluated at 12 to 17 distinct measurement points spread strategically over the course of a transfer by use of the RASS and BIS. To investigate the relation between the RASS and the BIS, Spearman's squared rank correlation coefficient (ρ(2)) and the Kendall's rank correlation coefficient (τ) were calculated. The diagnostic value of the BIS with respect to the RASS was investigated by its sensitivity and positive predictive value for possible patient awakening. Therefore, measurements were dichotomized considering a clinically sensible threshold of 80 for BIS-values and classifying RASS values being nonnegative. RESULTS Spearman's rank correlation resulted to ρ(2) = 0.431 (confidence interval (CI) = 0.341 to 0.513). The Kendall's correlation coefficient was calculated as τ = 0.522 (CI = 0.459 to 0.576). Awakening of patients (RASS ≥ 0) was detected by a BIS value of 80 and above with a sensitivity of 0.97 (CI = 0.89 to 1.00) and a positive predictive value of 0.59 (CI = 0.45 to 0.71). CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that the BIS-Monitor can be used for the assessment of sedation levels in the intricate environment of a Mobile-ICU, especially when well-established clinical scores as the RASS are impracticable. The use of BIS is highly sensitive in the detection of unwanted awakening of patients during transfers.","Prottengeier, Johannes; Moritz, Andreas; Heinrich, Sebastian; Gall, Christine; Schmidt, Joachim",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-014-0615-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25418521/,21

SARS-CoV antigen expression occurred mainly in type I and II pneumocytes and serous cells of tracheo-bronchial submucosal glands of cats and in type II pneumocytes of ferrets. ACE2 expression occurred mainly in type I and II pneumocytes, tracheo-bronchial goblet cells, serous epithelial cells of tracheo-bronchial submucosal glands in cats, and type II pneumocytes and serous epithelial cells of tracheo-bronchial submucosal glands in ferrets. In conclusion, the pathology of SARS-CoV infection in cats and ferrets resembles that in humans except that syncytia and hyaline membranes were not observed. The identification of tracheo-bronchoadenitis in cats has potential implications for SARS pathogenesis and SARS-CoV excretion. Finally, these results show the importance of ACE2 expression for SARS-CoV infection in vivo: whereas ACE2 expression in type I and II pneumocytes in cats corresponded to SARS-CoV antigen expression in both cell types, expression of both ACE2 and SARS-CoV antigen in ferrets was limited mainly to type II pneumocytes.","van den Brand, J M A; Haagmans, B L; Leijten, L; van Riel, D; Martina, B E E; Osterhaus, A D M E; Kuiken, T",Veterinary pathology,https://doi.org/10.1354/vp.45-4-551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587105/,21

However, the methodology for PIIC preoperative risk assessment remains unestablished. We aimed to develop a preoperative risk model for postgastrectomy PIIC. METHODS We collected 183,936 patients' data on distal or total gastrectomy performed in 2013-2016 for gastric cancer from the Japanese National Clinical Database and divided into development (2013-2015; n = 140,558) and validation (2016; n = 43,378) cohort. The primary outcome was the incidence of PIIC. The risk model for PIIC was developed using 18 preoperative factors: age, sex, body mass index, activities of daily living, 12 comorbidity types, gastric cancer stage, and surgical procedure in the development cohort. Secondarily, we developed another model based on the new scoring system for clinical use using selected factors. RESULTS The overall incidence of PIIC was 4.7%, including 2.6%, 1.7%, and 1.3% in anastomotic leakage, pancreatic fistula, and intra-abdominal abscess, respectively. Among the 18 preoperative factors, male [odds ratio, (OR) 1.92], obesity (OR, 1.52-1.96), peripheral vascular disease (OR, 1.55), steroid use (OR, 1.83), and total gastrectomy (OR, 1.89) strongly correlated with PIIC incidence. The entire model using the 18 factors had good discrimination and calibration in the validation cohort. We selected eight relevant factors to create a simple scoring system, using which we categorized the patients into three risk groups, which showed good calibration. CONCLUSION Using nationwide clinical practice data, we created a preoperative risk model for postgastrectomy PIIC for gastric cancer.","Fujiya, Keiichi; Kumamaru, Hiraku; Fujiwara, Yoshiyuki; Miyata, Hiroaki; Tsuburaya, Akira; Kodera, Yasuhiro; Kitagawa, Yuko; Konno, Hiroyuki; Terashima, Masanori",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-020-01083-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32440807/,21

MATERIALS AND METHODS Disc-retained 12 F single-lumen Monarch gastrostomy tubes (Enteral UK, Selby, UK) were inserted by three gastrointestinal interventional radiologists in a supra-regional cancer centre. The 12 F tubes required a 20 F peel-away sheath with four-point gastropexy fixation and were placed under conscious sedation, using electrocardiogram (EEG) bispectral index monitoring. Follow-up was performed in an in-house gastrostomy drop-in clinic at 1 week and 1 month, supplemented with weekly telephone follow-up. Patients also had open access to the gastrostomy drop-in clinic for immediate advice and complication management. RESULTS Eighteen patients underwent primary insertion of a Monarch gastrostomy tube over 5 months. A total of 6/18 (33%) tubes displaced; 4/18 (22%) completely, 2/18 (11%) occult into the peritoneum. Four of 18 (22%) patients developed infection at the stoma site. Due to the unexpectedly poor performance of the tube, the study was terminated early. CONCLUSION Initial experience with the Monarch disc-retained gastrostomy tube demonstrates it unsuitable for primary placement with current protocols. In view of the potentially serious complications, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has been informed. A request has been made to the distributer to reassess the tube design and/or review the procedure promoted for primary placement.","Kibriya, N; Wilbraham, L; Mullan, D; Puro, P; Vasileuskaya, S; Edwards, D W; Laasch, H-U",Clinical radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2013.06.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23942264/,21

Eight domestic pigs were submitted to transumbilical endoscopic cholecystectomy by using the trichannel trocar technique. A fine grasper of 2 mm in diameter was inserted through a small skin incision on the right upper abdomen for grasping the gallbladders. The natural scar of the umbilicus was restored after extract of the specimen. All the gallbladders were removed successfully without severe bleeding during dissection, intraoperative, and postoperative complications. Postmortem examination revealed that the gallbladder fossa was clean, the clips on the cystic duct and artery were secure, and neither bile nor blood leakage was found at the operative field. The feasibility and safety of transumbilical endoscopic cholecystectomy are demonstrated by this study. It is possible to use this approach in patients with gallbladder diseases.","Jiang Fan Zhu,; Ying Zhang Ma,; Jin Ling Yu,; Hai Hu,",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350608318453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18480087/,21

Here, the GBL flavonoids were isolated in two different manners and then examined for their bioactivity, physicochemical stability, and biocompatibility. The majority of flavonoids in the non-hydrolyzed and acidolyzed isolates, termed non-hydrolyzed isolate (NI) and acidolyzed isolate (AI) hereafter, were rich in flavonol glycosides and aglycones, respectively. Glycosidic/aglyconic quercetin and kaempferol were abundant in both NI and AI, whereas a little of apigenin, luteolin, and isorhamnetin were found in AI. NI was more thermostable in all pH ranges than quercetin, kaempferol, and AI. NI and AI both inhibited neurotransmitter release from differentiated neuronal PC-12 cells. NI and AI showed 1/2-1/3 lower EC50/CC50 values than quercetin and kaempferol. The NI and AI exhibited no toxicity assessed by the tests on chorioallantoic membranes of hen's eggs, removing toxicological concerns of irritation potential. Moreover, GBL isolates, particularly AI, showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in the use below the CC50 levels. Taken together, these results suggest that GBL isolates that are rich in antioxidant flavonoids are effective anti-neuroexocytotic agents with high stability and low toxicity.","Ban, Choongjin; Park, Joon-Bum; Cho, Sora; Kim, Hye Rin; Kim, Yong Joon; Bae, Hyungjin; Kim, Chinhan; Kang, Hakhee; Jang, Davin; Shin, Yong Sub; Kim, Dae-Ok; Kim, Hyunggun; Kweon, Dae-Hyuk",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25081829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32316426/,21

The U.S. health care system is bifurcated into the ""haves"" and ""have nots."" The health care safety net hospitals, which were already financially weak, cared for the bulk of COVID-19 cases. In contrast, the ""have"" hospitals suffered financially because their most profitable procedures are elective and were postponed during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS To obtain relief fund data for each hospital in the U.S., we start with data from HHS posted on the CDC website. We use RAND Hospital Data to analyze how fund distributions are associated with hospital characteristics.

Fifty-one patients (age < 28 months) were consecutively divided into conventional (n = 28) and ultrasound (n = 23) groups. Tracheal tube size and insertion depth were determined using the age-based formula and auscultation in the conventional group, whereas using ultrasonographic measurement of subglottic diameter with auscultation and lung ultrasonography in the ultrasound group. We evaluated the initially selected tube size, insertion depth, ventilatory indices, and the incidence of airway complications and adverse events. Tube insertion depth (median [interquartile range]) was significantly greater in the ultrasound group than in the conventional group (13.5 cm [12.5-14.0] vs 13.0 cm [11.8-13.0], P = 0.045). The number of complications and adverse events was significantly higher in the conventional group than in the ultrasound group (32.1% vs 4.3%, P = 0.013).

To comparatively analyze the host transcriptional response between PRRSV-infected PAMs and bystanders PAMs that remained uninfected but were exposed to the inflammatory milieu of an infected lung, pigs were infected with a PRRSV strain expressing green fluorescent protein (PRRSV-GFP) and GFP+ (PRRSV infected) and GFP- (bystander) cells were sorted for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Approximately 4.2% of RNA reads from GFP+ and 0.06% reads from GFP- PAMs mapped to the PRRSV genome, indicating that PRRSV-infected PAMs were effectively separated from bystander PAMs. Further analysis revealed that inflammatory cytokines, interferon-stimulated genes, and antiviral genes were highly upregulated in GFP+ as compared to GFP- PAMs. Importantly, negative immune regulators including NF-κB inhibitors (NFKBIA, NFKBID, NFKBIZ, and TNFAIP3), and T-cell exhaustion markers (PD-L1, PD-L2, IL10, IDO1, and TGFB2) were highly upregulated in GFP+ cells as compared to GFP- cells. By using in situ hybridization assay, RNA transcripts of TNF and NF-κB inhibitors were detected in PRRSV-infected PAMs cultured ex vivo and lung sections of PRRSV-infected pigs during the acute stage of infection. Collectively, the results suggest that PRRSV infection upregulates expression of negative immune regulators and T-cell exhaustion markers in PAMs to modulate the host immune response. Our findings provide further insight into PRRSV immunopathogenesis. Importance PRRSV is widespread in many swine producing countries, causing substantial economic loses to the swine industry. PAM is considered the primary target for PRRSV replication in pigs. However, less than 2% of PAM from an acutely infected pigs are infected with the virus. In the present study, we utilized a PRRSV-GFP strain to infect pigs and sorted infected- and bystander- PAMs from the pigs during the acute stage of infection for transcriptome analysis. PRRSV infected PAMs showed a distinctive gene expression profile and contained many uniquely activated pathways compared to bystander PAMs. Interestingly, upregulated expression of and NF-κB signaling inhibitors and T-cell exhaustion molecules were observed in PRRSV-infected PAMs. Our findings provide additional knowledge on the mechanisms that PRRSV employs to modulate the host immune system.","Chaudhari, Jayeshbhai; Liew, Chia-Sin; Riethoven, Jean-Jack M; Sillman, Sarah; Vu, Hiep L X",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01052-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34379512/,21

Faced with this imbalance, how, when, and who decides, there is the impact of the stressful systems of professionals who are at the front line of care and, in the background, issues inherent to human subjectivity. Along this path, the idea of using artificial intelligence algorithms to replace health professionals in the decision-making process also arises. In this context, there is the ethical question of how to manage the demands produced by the pandemic. The objective of this work is to reflect, from the point of view of medical ethics, on the basic principles of the choices made by the health teams, during the COVID-19 pandemic, whose resources are scarce and decisions cause anguish and restlessness. The ethical values for the rationing of health resources in an epidemic must converge to some proposals based on fundamental values such as maximizing the benefits produced by scarce resources, treating people equally, promoting and recommending instrumental values, giving priority to critical situations. Naturally, different judgments will occur in different circumstances, but transparency is essential to ensure public trust.

With immediate priorities to protect the health and safety of both patients and healthcare service providers, ophthalmologists globally were advised to defer nonurgent cases, while at the same time managing sight-threatening conditions such as neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). The management of AMD patients both from a monitoring and treatment perspective presents a particular challenge for ophthalmologists. This review looks at how these pressures have encouraged the acceptance and speed of adoption of digitalization. DESIGN AND METHODS A literature review was conducted on the use of digital technology during COVID-19 pandemic, and on the transformation of medicine, ophthalmology and AMD screening through digitalization. RESULTS In the management of AMD, the implementation of artificial intelligence and ""virtual clinics"" have provided assistance in screening, diagnosis, monitoring of the progression and the treatment of AMD. In addition, hardware and software developments in home monitoring devices has assisted in self-monitoring approaches. CONCLUSIONS Digitalization strategies and developments are currently ongoing and underway to ensure early detection, stability and visual improvement in patients suffering from AMD in this COVID-19 era.

150313,Infection Load and Prevalence of Novel Viruses Identified from the Bank Vole Do Not Associate with Exposure to Environmental Radioactivity.,2019-12-30,"NEW FINDINGS What is the central question of this study? Whether cerebral autoregulation (CA) is impaired at high altitude and associated with acute mountain sickness remains controversial. We sought to compare two of the most common methods to assess dynamic CA in subjects who ascended to 3424 m and acclimatized. What is the main finding and its importance? We found that CA was reduced at 3424 m when assessed by the classic thigh-cuff inflation-deflation technique, but not when evaluated by transfer function analysis. These findings suggest that the cerebral vasculature of healthy individuals may become less able to buffer a large, abrupt drop in arterial blood pressure, while still maintaining the ability to regulate slow rhythmical oscillations, during periods of moderate hypoxaemia. ABSTRACT The occurrence and implications of changes in cerebral autoregulation (CA) at high altitude are controversial and confounded by differences in methods used to assess CA. To compare two of the most common methods of dynamic CA assessment, we studied 11 young, healthy sea-level residents (six females and five males; 20.5 ± 2.3 years old) as they ascended to 3424 m and acclimatized over 13 days. A common autoregulation index (ARI) was calculated from the following: (i) transfer function analysis (TFA ARI) of resting oscillations in arterial blood pressure (ABP; finger plethysmography) and middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv; transcranial Doppler); and (ii) MCAv responses following large, abrupt reductions in ABP using the classic thigh-cuff technique (Cuff ARI). Symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) were monitored using the Lake Louise AMS Questionnaire. Cuff ARI scores decreased (P = 0.021) as subjects ascended from low (4.7 ± 1.5) to high altitude (3.2 ± 1.6) and did not change after 13 days of acclimatization (2.9 ± 1.3). The TFA ARI scores were not affected by ascent or acclimatization to 3424 m. Neither Cuff nor TFA ARI scores were correlated with AMS symptoms. These findings suggest that the cerebral vasculature of healthy individuals may become less able to buffer large step changes in ABP, while still maintaining the ability to regulate slow rhythmical oscillations, during periods of moderate hypoxaemia. Given the inherent differences in the autoregulatory stimulus between methods, multiple assessment techniques may be needed to clarify the implications of changes in cerebrovascular regulation at high altitude.","Subudhi, Andrew W; Grajzel, Katalin; Langolf, Robert J; Roach, Robert C; Panerai, Ronney B; Davis, John E",Experimental physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/expphysiol.2014.082479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25480158/,21

Confronted with thousands of deaths daily worldwide, we have to build quickly the rationale behind the treatment, taking advantage from past analogues. When a new virus strikes, T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma/delta cells are in the first line of defence, activated by stress molecules and recognising some epitopes in a process that is major histocompatibility complex (MHC) independent but still specific, e.g. cytomegalovirus (CMV), as well as participating in the regulatory mechanism - both characteristics are useful in fighting SARS-CoV-2. The fatalities are mostly due to pneumonitis, in the course of which an overwhelming inflammatory process impairs blood oxygenation, calling for artificial ventilation. In fatal COVID-19 cases the balance between the immune response and the inflammatory outcome fails, due to which the patients at risk, mostly aged, have higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and an enhanced inflammatory process in the lung. Apparently there is no feedback control over the antibody production. The investigational use of convalescent plasma, providing antibodies taken from patients who have recovered, was shown to be effective, likely through exerting idiotype associated negative control of antibody production. Similarly, the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) may assist the body regulatory mechanisms, knowing the anti-inflammatory potential of these cells. The use of these two immunotherapeutic tools is understandable on the grounds of basic immunology, whose knowledge may direct the medical community in efforts to fight the virus.","Jaskula, Emilia; Lange, Andrzej",Polish archives of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.15388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32449333/,21

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the changes in urinalysis of COVID-19 patients with normal kidney function. METHODS The data of COVID-19 patients with normal renal functions were retrospectively analyzed. Urinalysis parameters of these patients were recorded. The patients were divided into three groups as mild, moderate and severe with respect to the clinical course of the disease. It was examined whether the urine analysis values in the groups were different from normal reference values and whether these values were different between the groups. In addition, possible relationship between the urinalysis parameters and the clinical severity of the disease was investigated. RESULTS There are three groups; mild (n:40), moderate (n:38) and severe (n:42). Mean age were significantly higher in the severe group, while gender distribution of the groups was similar. (p=0.033) (p=0.091) Creatinine values of all patients were normal. There were 6.7% glucose positivity, 13.4% protein positivity, 5.8% urobilinogen positivity and 7.5% ketone positivity in urine dipstick analysis and these changes were all significantly higher than the reference values. (p=0.008, p<0.0001, p=0.016, p=0.016) Pyuria and hematuria were detected in 8.3% and 9.2%, respectively. The urinalysis parameters and urine microscopy findings were not affected by the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS Glycosuria, proteinuria, pyuria and hematuria may occur during COVID-19 disease, regardless of comorbidity and renal dysfunction. However, these urine parameters were not correlated with the severity of the disease.","Demirelli, Erhan; Sönmez, Mehmet G; Tok, Doğan S; Çetin, Sinan; Öğreden, Ercan; Usta, Murat; Akyol, Safa; Çiftçi, Osman Ç; Demiray, Özay; Yavuz, İlknur; Oğuz, Ural",Minerva urology and nephrology,https://doi.org/10.23736/s2724-6051.21.04418-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34156201/,21

Cytokine adsorption has been incorporated in the management of some of these patients on an individual basis to control the imbalance of danger-associated molecular patterns and proinflammatory cytokines. However, little is known about the combination of V-V ECMO and cytokine adsorption as earlier reports contained mixed patient cohorts in terms of disease and mode of ECMO, veno-venous and veno-arterial. We here report single-center registry data of nine all-comers with severe ARDS treated with V-V ECMO and cytokine adsorption using the CytoSorb adsorber compared with a control group of nine propensity score matched patients undergoing V-V ECMO support without cytokine adsorption. Even though Respiratory ECMO Survival Prediction and PRedicting dEath for SEvere ARDS on V-V ECMO scores predicted a higher mortality in the cytokine adsorption group, mortality was numerically reduced in the patients undergoing V-V ECMO and cytokine removal compared with V-V ECMO alone. The need for fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support as well as lactate levels dropped significantly in the cytokine adsorption group within 72 hours, whereas vasopressor need and lactate levels did not decrease significantly in the control group. Therefore, our data suggest that cytokine adsorption might be beneficial in patients with severe ARDS requiring V-V ECMO support.","Rieder, Marina; Duerschmied, Daniel; Zahn, Timm; Lang, Corinna; Benk, Christoph; Lother, Achim; Biever, Paul; Bode, Christoph; Wengenmayer, Tobias; Staudacher, Dawid; Supady, Alexander",ASAIO journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000001302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181544/,21

DATA SOURCES EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane and MEDLINE databases were searched from 1980 to April 2019. International trial registries and reference lists of included studies completed our search. REVIEW METHODS Randomized controlled trials that involved interventions aiming to change the practice of clinicians working in stroke rehabilitation were included. Bias was evaluated using RevMan to generate a risk of bias table. Evidence quality was evaluated using GRADE criteria. RESULTS A total of 16 trials were included (250 sites, 14,689 patients), evaluating a range of interventions including facilitation, audit and feedback, education and reminders. Of which, 11 studies included multicomponent interventions (using a combination of interventions). Four used educational interventions alone, and one used electronic reminders. Risk of bias was generally low. Overall, the GRADE criteria indicated that this body of literature was of low quality. This review found higher efficacy of trials which targeted fewer outcomes. Subgroup analysis indicated moderate-level GRADE evidence (103 sites, 10,877 patients) that trials which included both site facilitation and tailoring for local factors were effective in changing clinical practice. The effect size of these varied (odds ratio: 1.63-4.9). Education interventions alone were not effective. CONCLUSION A large range of interventions are used to facilitate clinical practice change. Education is commonly used, but in isolation is not effective. Multicomponent interventions including facilitation and tailoring to local settings can change clinical practice and are more effective when targeting fewer changes.","Bird, Marie-Louise; Miller, Tiev; Connell, Louise A; Eng, Janice J",Clinical rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269215519847253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31066289/,21

Often they are at high risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease once infected. For this population, it is urgent to closely monitor HIV plasma viral load ( VL ) and screen for SARS-COV-2 infection. Method We have developed a non-proprietary method to isolate RNA from plasma, nasal secretions ( NS ), or both. HIV, SARS-CoV-2, and human RP targets in extracted RNA are then RT-qPCR to estimate the VL and classify HIV/SARS-CoV-2 status ( i . e ., HIV as VL failure or suppressed; SARS-CoV-2 as positive, presumptive positive, negative, or indeterminate). We evaluated this workflow on 133 clinical specimens: 40 plasma specimens (30 HIV-seropositive), 67 NS specimens (31 SARS-CoV-2-positive), and 26 pooled plasma/NS specimens (26 HIV-positive with 10 SARS-CoV-2-positive), and compared the results obtained using the in-house extraction to those using a commercial extraction kit. Results In-house extraction had a detection limit of 200-copies/mL for HIV and 100-copies/mL for SARS-CoV-2. In-house and commercial methods yielded positively correlated HIV VL (R 2 : 0.98 for contrived samples; 0.81 for seropositive plasma). SARS-CoV-2 detection had 100% concordant classifications in contrived samples, and in clinical NS extracted by in-house method, excluding indeterminate results, was 95% concordant (25 positives, 6 presumptive positives, and 31 negatives) to those using the commercial method. Analysis of pooled plasma/NS showed R 2 of 0.91 (contrived samples) and 0.71 (clinical specimens) for HIV VL correlations obtained by both extraction methods, while SARS-CoV-2 detection showed 100% concordance in contrived and clinical specimens. Interpretation Our low-cost workflow for molecular testing of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 could serve as an alternative to current standard assays for laboratories in low-resource settings.","Gulati, Gaurav K; Panpradist, Nuttada; Stewart, Samuel W A; Beck, Ingrid A; Boyce, Ceejay; Oreskovic, Amy K; García-Morales, Claudia; Avila-Ríos, Santiago; Han, Peter D; Reyes-Terán, Gustavo; Starita, Lea M; Frenkel, Lisa M; Lutz, Barry R; Lai, James J",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.18.21256786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34462759/,21

Methods: All the individuals identified to be infected with 2019-nCoV in Guangzhou, including confirmed cases and asymptomatic cases, were included and classified as imported cases and local cases. The first case of each cluster epidemic was defined as index case, and the number of subsequent infections was calculated to evaluate the contagiousness and secondary attack rate of 2019 novel coronavirus in the shortest incubation period of 1-3 days. Results: As of 18 February, 2020, a total of 349 cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 339 confirmed cases (97.13%) and 10 asymptomatic cases (2.87%) were reported in Guangzhou. There were 68 clusters involving 217 2019-nCoV infection cases (210 confirmed cases and 7 asymptomatic cases). The median number of subsequent infections caused by an index case in a cluster epidemic was 3, among which 2 were confirmed cases and 1 was asymptomatic cases, respectively. The average number of contagiousness was 2.18 in shorted incubation period of 1-3 days (The average number of infected cases were 2.18 cases by the index case in a cluster epidemic), the average infection number in family members was 1.86, and the infection ratio of family member transmission was 85.32% (1.86/2.18). The secondary attack rate in close contacts with shortest incubation period of 1-3 days was 17.12%-18.99%, the secondary attack rate in family members was 46.11%-49.56%. Conclusions: The cluster epidemic of COVID-19 in Guangzhou mainly occurred in families, the contagiousness was high.

We investigated the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia based on the timing of dexamethasone administration. Methods A single-center, retrospective cohort study based on medical record reviews was conducted between June 10 and September 21, 2020. We compared the risk of severe COVID-19, defined as the use of a high-flow nasal cannula or a mechanical ventilator, between groups that received dexamethasone either within 24 hours of hypoxemia (early dexamethasone group) or 24 hours after hypoxemia (late dexamethasone group). Hypoxemia was defined as room-air SpO2 <90%. Results Among 59 patients treated with dexamethasone for COVID-19 pneumonia, 30 were in the early dexamethasone group and 29 were in the late dexamethasone group. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics, the time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis or hospitalization, or the use of antiviral or antibacterial agents between the two groups. The early dexamethasone group showed a significantly lower rate of severe COVID-19 compared to the control group (75.9% vs 40.0%, P-value=0.012). Further, the early dexamethasone group showed a significantly shorter total duration of oxygen supplementation (10.45 d vs. 21.61 d, P-value=0.003) and length of stay in the hospital (19.76 d vs. 27.21 d, P-value=0.013). However, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and in-hospital mortality rates were not significantly different between the two groups.

It has also recently been linked to COVID-19 pandemic. To analyze this possible association in Italy, studies on the entire area of the peninsula are necessary, both urban and non-urban areas. Therefore, there is a need for a homogeneous and applicable exposure assessment tool throughout the country.Experiences of high spatio-temporal resolution models for Italian territory already exist for PM estimation, using space-time predictors, satellite data, air quality monitoring data.This work completes the availability of these estimations for the most recent years (2016-2019) and is also applied to nitrogen oxides and ozone. The spatial resolution is 1x1 km.The model confirms its capability of capturing most of PM variability (R2=0.78 and 0.74 for PM10 e PM2.5, respectively), and provides reliable estimates also for ozone (R2=0.76); for NO2 the model performance is lower (R2=0.57). The model estimations were used to calculate the PWE (population-weighted exposure) as the annual mean, weighted on the resident population in each individual cell, which represents the estimation of the Italian population's chronic exposure to air pollution.These estimates are ready to be used in studies on the association between chronic exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 pathology, as well as for investigations on the role of air pollution on the health of the Italian population.","Stafoggia, Massimo; Cattani, Giorgio; Ancona, Carla; Ranzi, Andrea",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.s2.115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412807/,21

OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness and safety of ERA in CTD-PAH. METHODS A literature search, using MEDLINE, COCHRANE, CINAHL and EMBASE databases was conducted, from inception to May 2019 to identify randomized control studies of ERA, as monotherapy or in combination with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i), in CTD-PAH. A protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019136956). Efficacy outcomes, including the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and composite clinical failure endpoints (CFE), and safety outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 13 studies, including 784 CTD-PAH participants, were identified. ERA, as monotherapy, did not reduce the risk of CFE compared to placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.77, 95% CI 0.50-1.19, P = .25). By contrast, combination therapy (ERA + PDE5i) significantly reduced the risk of developing CFE vs monotherapy (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.90, P = .02). 6MWD did not improve when comparing monotherapy vs placebo (+17.41 m; 95% CI -19.83-54.66) P = .36) or combination therapy vs monotherapy (+13.17 m; 95% CI -16.44-42.78, P = .38). ERA-related adverse events rates in CTD-PAH and general PAH cohorts were comparable. CONCLUSIONS ERA, when used in combination with PDE5is, are associated with reduced risk of CFE, but no significant changes in 6MWD, in CTD-PAH. This warrants further studies investigating early combination therapy as a standard of care in this group.","Shivakumar, Senthuran; Thynne, Tilenka R; Mohammadi, Leila; Burdeniuk, Christine; Mangoni, Arduino A",International journal of rheumatic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-185x.13916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691518/,21

METHODS Between February 10, 2020 and March 31, 2020, data of severe and critical COVID-19 patients were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Admission data included age, heart rates, mean arterial pressure, and myocardial injury markers including creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB), myoglobin, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and interleukin-6. The endpoints included mortality, the incidence of malignant arrhythmia, and mechanical ventilation time. Univariate regression analysis, multivariate linear regression analysis, and binary logistic analysis were performed to develop the risk predictors in myocardial injury to the prognosis of severe and critical COVID-19 patients. RESULTS Seventy-four COVID-19 patients were included (mean age of 67.2 ± 14.6 years, male of 66.2%), including 42 severe and 32 critical cases. The mortality was 62.2% (n = 46).

Early diagnosis of lung cancer is the key to better prognosis and longer survival. While there are substantial literature reporting delays in cancer diagnosis, there is a lack of consensus in the definitions and terms used to describe 'delay' in the treatment pathway. The aim of this scoping review is to identify and critically synthesise the operational definitions and terminologies used to describe the timely initiation of care and consequent treatments over the care pathway for patients with lung cancer. This scoping review will also compare how timeliness was operationalised in Western and Asian countries. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The scoping review will use the methodology described by Arksey and O'Malley and endorsed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO electronic databases will be searched. Grey literature sources and the reference lists of key studies will be used to identify additional relevant studies. The scoping review will include all studies, irrespective of study methodology and quality. Two reviewers will independently screen all titles and abstracts to identify eligible studies for inclusion. The full texts of identified studies will be further examined and charted using a data extraction form. A narrative synthesis will be performed to assess and categorise available definitions of timeliness. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not needed as this scoping review will be reviewing already published articles. The results produced from this review will be submitted to a scientific peer-reviewed journal for publication and will be presented at scientific meetings.","Ansar, Adnan; Lewis, Virginia; McDonald, Christine Faye; Liu, Chaojie; Rahman, Aziz",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33148754/,21
161952,"Structure, Activity and Function of the Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 6.",2021-09-11,"Contaminated water resources remain a major global concern regarding public health. The majority of water safety protocols include indicators of microbial contamination to evaluate the potential risk to public health and are key elements of quality guidelines. Among these, markers for total coliforms and fecal coliforms are strong indicators of co-contamination with other pathogens. Traditional methods, recurring to slow and cumbersome culture-based approaches, have been gradually replaced by molecular methods, capable of faster and more specific screening. These are usually PCR-based methods that may allow for multiple pathogen detection but require dedicated laboratory equipment, hindering the rapid on-site assessment. Here, we used a multiplex Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (mLAMP) strategy for the amplification of two markers associated with the contamination by total and fecal coliforms (e.g. Escherichia coli) - lacZ and uidA genes, respectively - thus allowing for single tube multiplex detection. The mLAMP products were then subject to an Au-nanoprobe colorimetric detection assay for precise discrimination of targets. This approach was validated in 22 water samples that were also screened for the presence of lacZ and uidA using standard and quantitative PCR, with the capability for discriminating the contamination level, e.g. a semi-quantitative evaluation of water quality.","Oliveira, Beatriz B; Veigas, Bruno; Carlos, Fábio Ferreira; Sánchez-Melsió, Alexandre; Balcázar, José Luís; Borrego, Carles M; Baptista, Pedro Viana",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887010/,21

In COVID 19 pandemic many people are suffering from different types of respiratory diseases. There is a shortage of medical professionals and hence there is a requirement of artificial intelligence-based tools for automatic diagnosis of pulmonary diseases in the lungs. This paper presents a machine learning-based automatic classification method for the diagnosis of multiple pulmonary diseases from lung sounds. This work uses comprehensive lung sound categories labeled by a medical professional for use in machine learning-based classification. The proposed work uses four machine-learning classifiers (SVM, KNN, Naïve Bayes, and ANN) for the different discriminant features of lung sounds such as wheezing sound that can be used for diagnosis of asthma. For the detection of multiple lung sound in a noisy environment, data augmentation is used in training data and then trained the model where ANN using 5-fold cross-validation gives the average accuracy of 95.6%. The proposed method has low time complexity, is robust and non-invasive making it ideal for real-time applications to diagnose pulmonary diseases. © 2021 IEEE.","Rani, S.; Chaurasia, A.; Dutta, M.

Accurate predictions of cognate pMHC targets for T Cell Receptors (TCR) would greatly facilitate identification of vaccine targets for both pathogenic diseases as well as personalized cancer immunotherapies. Predicting immunogenic epitopes therefore has been at the centre of intensive research for the past decades but has proven challenging. Although numerous models have been proposed, performance of these models has not been systematically evaluated and their success rate in predicting epitopes for humans has not been measured and compared. In this study, we curate and present a ‘standard-dataset’ of class I MHC epitopes for evaluating the performance of immunogenicity classifiers. Using this data, we present a systematic evaluation of performance of several publicly available models which are commonly used to predict CD8+ T cell epitopes in the context of both pathogens and cancers. The benchmarking is performed in two different settings: a pan-HLA setting in which all models are trained and evaluated by a pool of peptides from multiple HLA types, and a HLA-specific setting in which models are trained and evaluated by peptides from HLA-A02:01. In the pan-HLA setting, we observe that the best performing model achieves 75.6% accuracy suggesting considerable room for improvement. In the HLA-specific setting we observe a substantial reduction in performance with a mean of −11.9%. Our work shows that existing models exhibit suboptimal performance for predicting immunogenic cancer neoantigens. We then further interrogate the underlying problems of model predictions and highlight HLA-bias as a main source of variation amongst other issues associated with the design of models and/or to their training data.","Buckley, Paul R.; Ma, Ruichong; Lee, Chloe H.; Woodhouse, Isaac; Woo, Jeongmin; Tsvetkov, Vasily O; Shcherbinin, Dmitrii S; Antanaviciute, Agne; Shugay, Mikhail; Rei, Margarida; Simmons, Alison; Koohy, Hashem",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.25.424183,21

Students could, therefore, attend classes from virtually any location using their mobile devices and Internet access. Despite the prolonged pandemic, little attention has been paid to whether offering courses on a virtual meeting platform is sustainable. This study, therefore, explores the antecedents of students’ intentions regarding the sustained use of virtual meeting platforms for academic courses. We investigated the relationship between technology readiness (TR) and perceived social presence (SP) within a virtual communication setting with course satisfaction and sustained use intention. Data were collected via a survey from 525 college students in South Korea who had attended classes using a virtual meeting platform. Serial mediation analysis revealed a pathway in which SP and course satisfaction in series fully mediate the positive relationship between technology readiness and sustainability. This study discusses the implications in relation to the sustainability of virtual technology-based courses as a replacement of live classroom-based courses from a user perspective. Further research is needed to understand users’ negative experiences of attending courses on virtual meeting platforms.","Yi, Yumi Moon Rosemary Hyejin",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158203,21

From the six APOGEE-2 Jhelum pointings, we isolate stars with log($g$) $<$ 3.5, leaving a sample of 289 red giant stars. From this sample of APOGEE giants, we identified seven stars that are consistent with the astrometric signal from $Gaia$ DR2 for this stream. Of these seven, one falls onto the RGB along the same sequence as the Jhelum stars presented by \cite{ji20}. This new Jhelum member has [Fe/H]=-2.2 and is at the tip of the red giant branch. By selecting high orbital eccentricity, metal-rich stars, we identify red giants in our APOGEE sample that are likely associated with the $Gaia$-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) merger. We compare the abundance profiles of the Jhelum stars and GES stars and find similar trends in $\alpha$-elements, as expected for low-metallicity populations. However, we find that the orbits for GES and Jhelum stars are not generally consistent with a shared origin. The chemical abundances for the APOGEE Jhelum star and other confirmed members of the stream are similar to stars in known stellar streams and thus are consistent with an accreted dwarf galaxy origin for the progenitor of the stream, although we cannot rule out a globular cluster origin.","Sheffield, Allyson A.; Subrahimovic, Aidan Z.; Refat, Mohammad; Beaton, Rachael L.; Hasselquist, Sten; Hayes, Christian R.; Price-Whelan, Adrian.

We examined the association between community vulnerability to disasters and pandemics and geographic access to each of the three medications for opioid use disorder within the continental US and if this association was impacted by urban, suburban, or rural classification. We found communities with greater vulnerability did not have greater geographic access to medications for opioid use disorder and the mismatch between vulnerability and medication access was greatest in suburban communities. Rural communities had poor geographic access to all three medications regardless of vulnerability. Future disaster preparedness planning should include anticipation of access to medications for opioid use disorder and better match the location of services to communities with greater vulnerability to prevent inequities in opioid overdose deaths.","Joudrey, P.

The analysis is built on empirical evidence of the Chinese Health Code System (HCS), compared to similar plans for the “COVID-19 Certificate” in the European Union (EU). Implementing the HCS has shown two-sided regulatory implications: improving social protection (a national strategy, a common mutual-recognition standard, scaled-up public–private cooperation) and increasing risks of social exclusion (non-digital and digital forms of vulnerability). This article argues that algorithmic vulnerability is caused by mismatches between biased databases, unfairly pre-designed algorithms and dynamically changed risk groups in reality in the context of COVID-19 vaccination. It contributes a framework for deploying plans for digital certificates in the EU concerning minimising the social risks associated with algorithmic vulnerability. The framework consists of (1) reinforcing existing vulnerability inherited from non-digital society (eg caused by intersectional factors of race/ethnicity, gender, age and health) and (2) introducing new forms of vulnerability generated by algorithm design and implementation (eg excluding the risk groups of individuals who are un/mis/overrepresented in the databases, such as those defined by nationality plus COVID-19 status).","Janet Hui, X.

This situation has had a devastating effect on all economic and social sectors, provoking either a decrease or cessation of business or profound changes in life habits. One of the most affected industries has been tourism, due to the resulting travel restrictions and a sharp drop in demand among travellers as well as temporary hotel and restaurant closures. Thus, the primary purpose of this study is to analyse the changes during the pandemic in individual consumers’ behaviour patterns in the tourism sector. Predictive market research techniques through quantitative analysis were carried out via surveys (n = 712). One of the more significant findings to emerge from this study is that recollection of these times will be in people’s minds for a long time after the pandemic. Notably, tourists will reward safety over leisure and will continue to undertake independent tours with their own vehicles. Findings also proved—and for the tourism sector this is good news—that travellers’ trust will be rebuilt, and tourists will be travelling again.","Araújo-Vila, Noelia Fraiz-Brea Jose A.; Pereira, Alexandra Matos",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158449,21

However, little is known about changes in behaviors during COVID-related lockdowns. To characterize diet behavior changes experienced by former participants of a food security intervention during COVID-related lockdowns. We conducted semi-structured interviews by phone with 17 patient participants in May - June 2020 with program participants who had completed the program within the past 6 months. Participants were asked questions about the program, diet and stress-related behaviors, and changes in these behaviors within the COVID lockdown period. Participants were mainly middle-aged (mean age 59 years), African American (100%), women (59%). Approximately half screened positive for food insecurity (47.1%). All participants were healthy at the time of the interview. Transcripts of interviews were analyzed for both apriori and emergent themes using thematic analysis. We identified 3 central themes. First, participants discussed changes in shopping behaviors to minimize time spent in stores using approaches like shopping lists to plan routes within the store or sending younger relatives to shop for them. Due to supply issues at stores, participants discussed adapting recipes to include available options. Second, participants discussed disinterest in cooking, a lack of motivation to engage in healthy eating strategies they had previously adopted, and anticipation of regretting these behaviors post-COVID. Third, participants were largely uncomfortable at the prospect of resuming in-person programming and preferred virtual options due to safety concerns. Among former participants of the GF4H program, shopping and cooking behaviors shifted during the COVID-19 lockdown period to adapt to safety guidelines and to overcome supply issues. Motivation to engage in healthy cooking and eating behaviors was diminished. Ongoing program efforts should focus on virtual options to engage and re-engage participants. NIH.

169952,Identification of protein-protected mRNA fragments and structured excised intron RNAs in human plasma by TGIRT-seq peak calling,2020-06-26,"We present a new theoretical framework for large-scale mRNA translation using a network of models called the ribosome flow model with Langmuir kinetics (RFMLK), interconnected via a pool of free ribosomes. The input to each RFMLK depends on the pool density, and it affects the initiation rate and the internal ribosome entry rates at each site along each RFMLK. Ribosomes that detach from an RFMLK due to termination or premature drop-off are fed back into the pool. We prove that the network always converges to a steady-state, and study its sensitivity to variations in the parameters. For example, we show that if the drop-off rate at some site in some RFMLK is increased then the pool density increases and consequently the steady-state production rate in all the other RFMLKs increases. Surprisingly, we also show that modifying a parameter of a certain RFMLK can lead to arbitrary effects on the densities along the modified RFMLK, depending on the parameters in the entire network. We conclude that the competition for shared resources generates an indirect and intricate web of mutual effects between the mRNA molecules, that must be accounted for in any analysis of translation.","Jain, Aditi; Margaliot, Michael; Gupta, Arvind Kumar",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.15.460428,21
170568,Structure of the Human Signal Peptidase Complex Reveals the Determinants for Signal Peptide Cleavage,2020-11-11,"The recognized human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is through respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces. However, the high transmissibility of the virus and the pattern of symptoms of COVID-19 suggest the likelihood of other forms of spread. Increasing evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by the feco-oral route. SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect gastrointestinal epithelial cells and a significant number of infected people have gastrointestinal symptoms. Viable viruses, viral RNA, and prolonged shedding of viral RNA have been detected in the feces of COVID-19 patients. The virus has been found in sewage and surface waters of several countries. The possible feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could be significant in low-income countries. High poverty levels and the collapse of health and other public services might increase the risk of Venezuelans to suffer a more devastating impact from COVID-19 than other populations. In conclusion, the feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been demonstrated. However, it is conceivable and the impact of COVID-19 could be high in low-income countries, especially in Venezuela due to its humanitarian crisis. The lack of information on the viability and infectivity of the virus in wastewaters and surface waters and the risk of transmission of the infection are important gaps in knowledge that deserve further investigation.","Chacin-Bonilla, L.; Chacon, N.",Investigacion Clinica,https://doi.org/10.22209/ic.v62s2a05,21

Faster rates of change in complex environments antagonize the traditional risk assessment approach and demand a more dynamic approach. A framework commonly used for understanding the challenges of complexity in the modern business environment is VUCA. VUCA stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. In order to mitigate the impact of a VUCA environment on complex projects, organizations and project leaders need to know the type and severity of challenges they are dealing with in each unique project. This study explores the VUCA framework in the context of projects and suggests that the VUCA approach can enhance the conventional risk assessment procedure. The study also drafts an accessible diagnostic tool to assess the VUCA dimensions a project is facing, so that project managers can effectively isolate “fat tail” risk events. The tool is tested on five complex projects in the manufacturing industry and its effectiveness is discussed.","Ingason, Helgi Thor Haukur Ingi Jonasson Kristjansdottir Bara Hlin",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13073808,21

Observations show that most of them situate randomly across urban centers in Nigeria and have no access to pronounced shelter, healthcare facilities, hygiene materials, and defined source of income. In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic currently ravaging many countries, most governments adopted the Stay-at-Home policy among some other policy measures that were recommended by the World Health Organization toward containing the spread of the virus. Given the COVID-19 Stay-at-Home policy of Nigerian Government, this study looked into the plight of the homeless-poor with a view to evolve an inclusive pro-poor housing strategy for the country. Findings show that the homeless poor have negative perceptions of the Stay-at-Home policy, which they see as being rather inimical to their survival. The study highlights lack of space and shelter as major reasons for their aversion to social distancing. Their reasons have serious implications for compliance to the COVID-19 Stay-at-Home policy as well as the spread curve of the virus. The study therefore recommends a review of the COVID-19 Regulation toward incorporating “Pro-Poor Housing Provisions” measures strictly for the homeless poor in the country. Strong collaboration between government and established institutions, such as Government-Church/Mosque strategy, is also recommended. © The Author(s) 2021.","Obasi, C. O.; Anierobi, C.

Here, we developed a rapid, dip-type, wash-free plasmonic fiber optic absorbance biosensor (P-FAB) strategy for the point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2 N-protein, expressed abundantly during the infection. P-FAB involves a sandwich assay with plasmonic labels on the surface of a U-bent fiber optic sensor probe with a high evanescent wave absorbance (EWA) sensitivity. The SARS-CoV-2 N-protein is quantified in terms of the change in the intensity of the light propagating through the U-bent sensor probe coupled to a green LED and a photodetector. Firstly, the optical fiber material (silica vs. polymeric optical fiber), was evaluated to realize a sensitive sensor platform. The optimal size of AuNP labels (20, 40, and 60 nm) to achieve high sensitivity and a lower limit of detection (LoD) was investigated. Following the P-FAB strategy, fused silica/glass optical fiber (GOF) U-bent senor probe and citrate-capped AuNP labels (size ~40 nm) gave rise to an LoD down to ~2.5 ng/mL within 10 mins of read-out time. Further, studies on development and validation of a point of care (PoC) read-out device, and preclinical studies are in progress.

High erythrocyte membrane variant rates paralleled genomic damage and prevalence indices in the general population. In blinded analyses, patients with greater hemorrhagic severity that had been attributed solely to their vasculopathy had more deleterious variants in platelet (Spearman {rho}=0.25, p=0.008) and coagulation (Spearman {rho}=0.21, p=0.024) genes.

Conventional venipuncture offers only a small snapshot of our broad immune landscape as immune responses may occur outside of the time and location parameters available for conventional venipuncture. A self-operated method that enables flexible sampling of liquid whole blood coupled with immediate stabilization of cellular RNA is instrumental in facilitating capture and preservation of acute or transient immune fluxes. To this end, we developed homeRNA: a kit for self-collection of peripheral blood (∼0.5 mL) and immediate stabilization of cellular RNA, using the Tasso- SST™ blood collection device with a specially designed stabilizer tube containing RNAlater™. To assess the feasibility of homeRNA for self-collection and stabilization of whole blood RNA, we conducted a pilot study (n = 47 participants) where we sent homeRNA to participants aged 21-69, located across 10 US states (94% successful blood collections, n = 61/65). Among participants who successfully collected blood, 93% reported no or minimal pain/discomfort using the kit (n = 39/42), and 79% reported very easy/somewhat easy stabilization protocol (n = 33/42). Total RNA yield from the stabilized samples ranged between 0.20 µg and 5.99 µg (mean = 1.51 µg), and all but one RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values were above 7.0 (mean = 8.1), indicating limited RNA degradation.

Measuring excitatory post-synaptic calcium transients through calcium permeable AMPA receptors is one way to monitor synaptic strength at individual synaptic contacts. Using a membrane targeted genetic calcium sensor, we demonstrate that one can measure synaptic events at individual synaptic contacts in Aplysia sensory-motor neuron synapses. These results show that synaptic strength is not evenly distributed between all contacts in these cultures, but dominated by multiquantal sites of synaptic contact. The probability, quantal size and quantal content can be measured over days at individual synaptic contacts using this technique. Surprisingly, most synaptic contacts were not found opposite presynaptic varicosities, but instead at areas of pre- and post-synaptic contact with no visible thickening of membranes. This technique shows promise in being able to address whether specialized synapses maintain synaptic strength underlying memory.","Dunn, Tyler W; Sossin, Wayne S",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.10.434766,21

Vulnerabilities to the most serious consequences of infection include older age, obesity, African American race and the presence of comorbid conditions. African American cancer survivors represent a particularly high-risk group, therefore understanding the impact of the virus and our strategies to prevent its spread on this patient population is important. Methods: The Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (ROCS) cohort is a unique effort to understand the determinants of poor outcomes in African American cancer survivors. Eligible participants were diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer on or after 1/1/2013, or with endometrial or any other cancer before age 50 on or after 01/01/2016 and were identified through the Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System cancer registry. To date, we have enrolled 4173 survivors. Full participation includes completion of a baseline survey, and collection of biospecimens, medical records and tumor tissue, if available. Participants are also followed annually for outcomes and changes in history. A supplemental survey focused on the impact of COVID-19 was offered to enrolled participants beginning in the spring of 2020. The results presented here include data from 890 survivors who also completed the ROCS COVID survey. Results: Nearly all ( &gt; 99%) survivors reported some change in their daily activities in an effort to reduce the risk of infection. At the time of survey, just over 1/3 of participants reported being tested for the virus and among those, 12% reported positive results. More than 40% of survivors reported some disruption in their access to medical care. A substantial ( &gt; 40%) proportion of survivors reported feeling anxious, depressed and/or isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 40% of patients reported changes in health behaviors as a direct result of the pandemic that are known to negatively affect survivorship outcomes (physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol use). Notably, 30% of survivors reported declines in physical activity and these declines were significantly associated with increased anxiety (p = 0.008), depression (p = 0.005) and poorer healthrelated quality of life (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The influence of the COVID- 19 pandemic on African American cancer survivors has been substantial, affecting both their physical and mental health and access to needed medical care. Coupled with changes in health behaviors as a direct result of the pandemic, these factors will likely affect outcomes in this high-risk patient population making further study and interventions necessary to mitigate the long-term impact of the pandemic on cancer outcomes.","Beebe-Dimmer, J.

Patients with severe COVID-19 usually have pneumonia concomitant with local inflammation and sometimes a cytokine storm. Specific components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus trigger lung inflammation, and recruitment of immune cells to the lungs exacerbates this process, although much remains unknown about the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our study of lung type II pneumocyte cells (A549) demonstrated that ORF7, an open reading frame (ORF) in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, induced the production of CCL2, a chemokine that promotes the chemotaxis of monocytes, and decreased the expression of IL-8, a chemokine that recruits neutrophils. A549 cells also had an increased level of IL-6. The results of our chemotaxis transwell assay suggested that ORF7 augmented monocyte infiltration and reduced the number of neutrophils. We conclude that the ORF7 of SARS-CoV-2 may have specific effects on the immunological changes in tissues after infection. These results suggest that the functions of other ORFs of SARS-CoV-2 should also be comprehensively examined.","Wang, Gang; Guan, Jun; Li, Guojun; Wu, Fengtian; Yang, Qin; Huang, Chunhong; Shao, Junwei; Xu, Lichen; Guo, Zixuan; Zhou, Qihui; Zhu, Haihong; Chen, Zhi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.13.460185,21

We constructed a fusion protein that stimulates red blood cell production and neuroprotection without triggering platelet production, a marker for thrombosis. The protein consists of an anti-glycophorin A nanobody and an erythropoietin mutant (L108A). The mutation reduces activation of erythropoietin receptor homodimers that induce erythropoiesis and thrombosis, but maintains the tissue-protective signaling. The binding of the nanobody element to glycophorin A rescues homodimeric erythropoietin receptor activation on red blood cell precursors. In a cell proliferation assay, the fusion protein is active at 10−14 M, allowing an estimate of the number of receptor–ligand complexes needed for signaling. This fusion protein stimulates erythroid cell proliferation in vitro and in mice, and shows neuroprotective activity in vitro.

The first model is derived from a set of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the rates at which population transitions take place among classes. The other is a particle model, which is a specific case of crowd simulation model, in which the disease is transmitted through particle collisions and infection rates are varied by adjusting the particle velocities. The parameters of these two models are tuned using information on COVID-19 from the literature and country-specific data, including the effect of restrictions as they were imposed and lifted. We demonstrate the applicability of both models using data from Cyprus, for which we find that both models yield very similar results, giving confidence in the predictions.","Alexandrou, Constantia; Harmandaris, Vangelis; Irakleous, Anastasios; Koutsou, Giannis; Savva, Nikos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03165v2.pdf,21

Although simulation studies seem to be helpful, there is no model that addresses the how much testing to be conducted to minimise the emerging infectious disease outbreaks. In this study, we develop a testing susceptible, infectious, exposed, recovered, and dead (testing-SEIRD) model using two discrete populations inside and outside hospitals. The populations that tested positive were isolated. Through the simulations, we examined the infectious spread represented by the number of cumulative deaths, hospitalisations, and positive tests, depending on examination strategies, testing characteristics, and hospitalisation capacity. We found all-or-none responses of either expansion or extinction of the infectious spreads, depending on the rates of follow-up and mass testing, which represent testing the people identified as close contacts with infected patients using follow-up surveys and people with symptoms, respectively. We also demonstrated that there were optimal and worst examination strategies, which were determined by the total resources and testing costs. The testing-SEIRD model is useful in making decisions on examination strategies for the emerging infectious disease outbreaks.","Onishi, T.; Honda, N.; Igarashi, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.31.21262868v1?rss=1,21

Lebanon experienced its largest wave of COVID-19 infections from January to April 2021. Limited genomic surveillance was undertaken, with just twenty six SARS-CoV-2 genomes available for this period, nine of which were from travellers from Lebanon detected by other countries. Additional genome sequencing is thus needed to allow surveillance of variants in circulation. Methods: Nine hundred and five SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced using the ARTIC protocol. The genomes were derived from SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, selected retrospectively from the sentinel COVID-19 surveillance network, to capture diversity of location, sampling time, gender, nationality and age. Results: Although sixteen PANGO lineages were circulating in Lebanon in January 2021, by February there were just four, with the Alpha variant accounting for 97% of samples. In the following two months, all samples contained the Alpha variant. However, this had changed dramatically by June and July, when all samples belonged to the Delta variant. Discussion: This study provides a ten-fold increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available from Lebanon. The Alpha variant, first detected in the UK, rapidly swept through Lebanon, causing the country's largest wave to date, which peaked in January 2021. The Alpha variant was introduced to Lebanon multiple times despite travel restrictions, but the source of these introductions remains uncertain. The Delta variant was detected in Gambia in travellers from Lebanon in mid-May, suggesting community transmission in Lebanon several weeks before this variant was detected in the country. Prospective sequencing in June/July 2021 showed that the Delta variant had completely replaced the Alpha variant in under six weeks.","Merhi, G.; Trotter, A.

We transformed an empty retail unit in the centre of Wales’ largest shopping centre into an interactive and immersive microbiology experience. We aimed to facilitate opportunities for two-way dialogue to impart positive impact on the awareness of antibiotic resistance, whilst concurrently evaluating the efficacy of an engagement strategy focused on the utilisation of public spaces to attract public demographics diverse to those who would normally engage with STEM outreach. Over the course of 14 days, we welcomed 6,566 visitors, with 67% attending as part of the natural footfall of the shopping centre. We created 1,625 young Antibiotic Resistance Champions, located in over 200 schools. Through a multi-lateral evaluation strategy, we were able to collect quantitative and qualitative feedback on the success of our delivery model, and the impact on our stakeholders. Herein, we will discuss the evolution of ‘Superbugs’ from concept, planning and design, to the logistics of delivering an engagement event of this scale. We will focus in particular on the learning outcomes of the project, and how this will shape the future of our ‘Superbugs’ project, and engagement events beyond. Key Messages Creating a multi-disciplinary core team is essential to the success of large-scale engagement events as well as the support and development of large numbers of colleagues/volunteers Utilising themes of exhibition and gameplay alongside strong fear-empowerment messages is an impactful way to confer positive influence and behaviour around antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the use of antibiotics ‘Pop-up shop’ is an effective mode of delivery to capture diverse public demographics far beyond those who would traditionally engage with scientific outreach and science engagement.","Tyrrell, Jonathan M.; Conlon, Christie S.; Aboklaish, Ali F.; Hatch, Sarah; Smith, Carl; Mathias, Jordan; Thomson, Kathryn; Eberl, Matthias",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.16.443502,21

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been identified as a public health threat worldwide. Previous studies, however, have reported contradictory results of COVID-19-related gastrointestinal symptoms in severe and mild forms. METHODS: A search of Medline, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted for articles published up to May 2020. Data from each study was combined using the random-effects model to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Sensitivity was examined by sequentially excluding one study in each turn. Publication bias was evaluated using the Egger’s and Begg’s tests. RESULTS: Twenty studies (4,265 patients) were reviewed. It was found that the prevalence of diarrhea [OR (0.40), (95% CI 0.91, -2.16), p = 0.03, I2 = 88.1%, PHeterogenity = 0.00)] and nausea and vomiting [OR (0.27), (95% CI 0.07, 1.01), p = 0.05, I2 = 89.3%, PHeterogenity = 0.00)] increased significantly in the severe form compared to the mild form of COVID-19, while abdominal pain and anorexia had no significant increased prevalence in admitted and hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Moreover, COVID-19-related gastrointestinal symptoms were seen in higher rates in males [OR (1.42), (95% CI 1.23, 1.65), p < 0.05, I2= 18.4%, PHeterogenity = 0.23] than in females.

Materials and Methods A total of 25 Candida spp. isolated from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, who were suspected to have pulmonary candidiasis, and 26 archived Candida spp. specimens were enrolled in this study. For the identification of Candida spp., PCR was performed to detect and amplify the ITS1 and ITS4 genes. Then the products were subjected to the Msp I restriction enzyme to precisely identify the species. The amplification of the WHP1 gene was conducted to identify Candida albicans species. The antifungal activities of routine drugs and the synthesize AuNPs against Candida spp. were assessed based on the protocols presented by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M60. Results In the present study, C. albicans (24; 96%) and C. parapsilosis (1; 4%) were identified as the etiologic agents of the pulmonary candidiasis associated with the COVID-19 infection. Voriconazol and amphotericin B had superior activity against all the isolates in this study. Treatment with fluconazole and itraconazole did not significantly change the formation of colony-forming units (CFU). However, treatment with the AuNPs significantly decreased (within the range of 92-99.1%; P<0.05) the number of CFUs.

Adolescents in the top quartile of exposures to onscreen tobacco incidents have been found to be approximately twice as likely to begin smoking as those in the bottom quartile. The 2010 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services strategic plan to reduce tobacco use includes reducing youth exposure to onscreen smoking. To monitor tobacco use in movies, Thumbs Up! Thumbs Down! (TUTD), a project of Breathe California of Sacramento-Emigrant Trails, counts occurrences of tobacco incidents in U.S. top-grossing movies each year. This report updates a previous report with the latest TUTD findings. In 2010, the number of onscreen tobacco incidents in youth-rated (G, PG, or PG-13) movies continued a downward trend, decreasing 71.6% from 2,093 incidents in 2005 to 595 in 2010. Similarly, the average number of incidents per youth-rated movie decreased 66.2%, from 20.1 in 2005 to 6.8 in 2010. The degree of decline, however, varied substantially by motion picture company. The three companies with published policies designed to reduce tobacco use in their movies had an average decrease in tobacco incidents of 95.8%, compared with an average decrease of 41.7% among the three major motion picture companies and independents without policies. This finding indicates that an enforceable policy aimed at reducing tobacco use in youth-rated movies can lead to substantially fewer tobacco incidents in movies and help prevent adolescent initiation of smoking.",,MMWR.

SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. As there are no confirmed antiviral drugs or vaccines currently available for the treatment of COVID-19, discovering potent inhibitors or vaccines are urgently required for the benefit of humanity. The glycosylated Spike protein (S-protein) directly interacts with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S-protein. As the S-protein is exposed to the surface and is essential for entry into the host, the S-protein can be considered as a first-line therapeutic target for antiviral therapy and vaccine development. In silico screening, docking, and molecular dynamics simulation studies were performed to identify repurposing drugs using DrugBank and PubChem library against the RBD of S-protein. The study identified a laxative drug, Bisoxatin (DB09219), which is used for the treatment of constipation and preparation of the colon for surgical procedures. It binds nicely at the S-protein-ACE2 interface by making substantial π-π interactions with Tyr505 in the 'Site 1' hook region of RBD and hydrophilic interactions with Glu406, Ser494, and Thr500. Bisoxatin consistently binds to the protein throughout the 100 ns simulation. Taken together, we propose that the discovered molecule, Bisoxatin may be a promising repurposable drug molecule to develop new chemical libraries for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host.","Unni, Sruthi; Aouti, Snehal; Thiyagarajan, Saravanamuthu; Padmanabhan, Balasundaram",Journal of biosciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33184246/,21

Pigs of both groups were serially euthanatized on postinoculation days (PID) 1, 2, 3, and 4 (after influenza virus). At necropsy, influenza virus titer and immunofluorescence in lung tissue were determined and gross lung lesions were recorded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Van Reeth, K; Pensaert, M B",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7802396/,21

Hope, or rather its absence, social isolation and loneliness are considered risk factors for the development of anxious and depressive symptoms. Health authorities have had to address issues regarding the mental health risks that the pandemic has created. There is numerous scientific evidences of the increase in affective disorders in the last two years. Associated with these disorders, particular characteristics of personality temperament, such as affective temperament, can determine an increased risk especially in some patient populations, such as the elderly, with significant negative consequences on the quality of life and on the onset of mental and organic diseases. The hope of the end of the pandemic has been placed on mass vaccination. After an initial enthusiasm there was a growing concern about its side effects. An adequate information policy is necessary to put an end to concerns about vaccines and thus lead to an increase in hope for the future and an end to social isolation.","Franza, Francesco; Solomita, Barbara; Tavormina, Giuseppe",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34559771/,21

These actions could have an impact on mental health in the general population. The objective of this study was to analyze the differences in psychopathological symptoms shown by Spanish general population during the COVID-19 quarantine based on sociodemographic, occupational and environmental-contextual variables. METHODS A cross-sectional pilot study was performed in a sample of 151 participants aged between 18-76 years old. The Symptom Assessment-45 Questionnaire via online was used to measure the severity of psychopathology symptoms. Socio-demographic, environmental and occupational variables were collected with an ad hoc questionnaire. The data were gathered from the 3rd to the 6th of April, 2020. A descriptive and comparative analysis was carried out using parametric contrasts (t test and ANOVA). RESULTS The younger participants (18-35 years) showed higher levels of hostility (t=2.24; p=0.02), depression (t=2.56; p=0.01), anxiety (t=2.78; p=0.006) and interpersonal sensitivity (t=2.08; p=0.04) than older participants (36-76 years). The active or employed people presented lower values of depressive symptoms (t=2.10; p=0.04) than unemployed people. The participants who dedicate less than 30 minutes on getting informed about COVID-19 showed higher scores for hostility (t=2.36; p=0.02) and interpersonal sensitivity (t=1.98; p=0.04) than participants who indicated dedicating at least 30 minutes. People who played sport daily reported a lower level of somatization symptoms (t=-2.11; p=0.03) than persons that did not play sport. Those who had relatives, acquaintances, etc. with COVID-19 reported higher levels of anxiety (t=2.09; p=0.04) than those who did not have close people infected. Lastly, participants who lived alone showed a higher level of psychoticism (F=3.93; p=0.02) compared to those who lived with more than two people. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study show that during quarantine can be identified groups with higher psychological vulnerability based on sociodemographic and occupational-contextual factors.","Becerra-García, Juan Antonio; Giménez Ballesta, Gala; Sánchez-Gutiérrez, Teresa; Barbeito Resa, Sara; Calvo Calvo, Ana",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32515363/,21

The sudden onset of SARS in hospital settings created an immediate necessity to study this phenomenon as hospitals and health care professionals struggle to adapt to this new epidemic environment. This study is the first using qualitative research to investigate the unique perspective of social workers in an epidemic environment. The results reflect the social workers' subjective experience of their interventions with patients and families and indicate that a number of professional tenets, such as advocacy, family-centered approach, knowledge of systems, open communication, and ethics effectively supported social work practice in a crisis environment.","Gearing, Robin Edward; Saini, Michael; McNeill, Ted",Health & social work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17432738/,21

From April 2020 to December 2020 on the basis of the University Clinical Hospital No. 4 of the First Moscow State Medical University named I.M. Sechenov (Sechenov University) of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation 245 patients between the ages of 27 and 89 with SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia were treated. The mean age of the patients was 56.7 ± 4.2 years. All patients participating in the study were divided by simple randomization into two groups. The volume of lesion of the lung parenchyma was assessed according to the data of computed tomography. All patients were treated for SARS-CoV-2 in a comprehensive manner in accordance with the temporary guidelines of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation with the mandatory prescription of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). Assessment and correction of the hemostasis system in 177 patients (47.7%) of group 1 was carried out daily using local coagulation tests (LCT), including APTT, PT, TT, PTI, INR, Fibrinogen and D-dimer level. The second group included 128 patients (52.3%), who, in addition to local coagulation tests, used the integral coagulation test - the thrombodynamics test- to assess and correct the state of the hemostatic system. Assessment and correction of hemostasis were performed at the control points (1, 7, 14 days) of the study. Compared to LCT, the thrombodynamics test reliably more often revealed the state of hypercoagulability, which was promptly corrected by increased doses of LMWH in group 2. Positive dynamics of clinical symptoms were detected in patients of group 2 1.8 times more often than in group 1 (p<0.05): fever and shortness of breath in group 2 decreased faster, the SpO2 index recovered more rapidly, especially in patients with severe hypoxia (with SpO2<90), the number of patients with moderate and severe severity by the third point of the study in group 2 was 1.8 times less than in group 1 (p<0.05). Severe forms of lung damage (CT-3 and CT-4) were detected in group 2 3.2 times less frequently (p <0.01) compared with group 1, and the number of deaths was 3.3 times less frequent (p<0.01) by the end of the study. The average bed-day in group 2 of patients (15±1.6 days) was 1.6 times shorter than in group 1 (24±7.2 days). Hemorrhagic complications were not recorded, despite the therapeutic doses of LMWH in patients of group 2. The severity of the condition of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and the dynamics of their symptoms depend on the state of microcirculation in the lungs and in the periphery and on the volume of thrombotic lesions. Anticoagulant therapy prescribed as early as possible in adequate therapeutic doses in patients with SARS-CoV-2 associated viral pneumonia made it possible to achieve positive treatment results. The use of the global coagulation thrombodynamics test has shown high efficiency for the timely assessment and correction of the state of the hemostasis system.","Krylov, A; Khorobrykh, T; Petrovskaya, A; Khmyrova, S; Agadzhanov, V; Khusainova, N",Georgian medical news,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34103434/,21
192093,Biomarkers: mining the biofluid proteome.,2005,"INTRODUCTION During the 2010/11 influenza season an epidemiological prospective cohort active study was organized, to evaluate etiologic role due to the main bacteria and viruses causing Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) and Influenza like-illness (ILl) in elderly and to explore the role of the bacterial nose-pharingeal carriage in subjects with respiratory tract infections. METHODS An integrated active surveillance of a cohort of adults aged > or = 60 y based on a double prospective and retrospective mechanisms of capture of ILl and CAP cases was organized. Samples were collected from all ILI and CAP prospectively identified. The samples were be tested by multiplex PCR for detection of the main respiratory bacteria and viruses. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The study population amounted to 2,551 adults. During the 2010/11 influenza season, the ILl cumulative incidence was 4.2%, that was twice higher than that calculated by regional sentinel-based Influenza surveillance system during the 2010/11 season in the elderly (2.2%). Among 45 patients with ILI of which had been collected the swab, 17 (37.8%) were positive for influenza viruses and 2 (4.4%) for RSV, 6 (13.3%) patients carried Streptococcus pn and 6 (13.3%) Haemophilus in. In the same period, 7 CAP cases were observed; 3 cases were prospectively identified and samples were collected, while 4 cases were retrospectively detected. The CAP cumulative incidence was 0,3%. The influenza vaccine effectiveness in prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza emerged by our study was 61%, in condition of good antigenic matching between vaccine and circulating strains observed during the 2010/11. These data contribute to better defining the epidemiological picture of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, fundamental information in light of the recent introduction of new vaccines for prevention of pneumonia in the elderly, including 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine.","Ansaldi, F; De Florentiis, D; Parodi, V; Rappazzo, E; Coppelli, M; Martini, M; Alicino, C; Durando, P; Icardi, G",Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23240167/,21
192101,Identification of overlapping DNA-binding and centromere-targeting domains in the human kinetochore protein CENP-C.,1996,"OBJECTIVES We aimed to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among Behçet's syndrome (BS) patients, evaluating the possible association between demographic and clinical features and the risk of infection. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate the possible association between BS disease activity and treatment, and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS A survey was conducted on BS patients followed at the Behçet's Centre of the Careggi University Hospital, Florence, Italy. We further evaluated the possible association between BS disease activity and treatment, and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS Out of 335 BS patients contacted, fourteen cases of SARS-CoV-2 were identified between April 1st, 2020 and February 9th, 2021, suggesting a prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among BS patients of 4.2%, in line with the data of the general population in Italy (4.4%). When comparing clinical features between SARS-CoV-2 cases and matched SARS-CoV-2 negative BS patients, we found that the presence of different disease manifestations did not significantly differ between the two groups. SARS-CoV-2 cases and controls were also comparable in terms of immunosuppressive therapy, with the only exception of corticosteroids (71.4% vs. 35.7%, p=0.030), whose daily dose was significantly higher in cases than controls [5mg/day (IQR 0-10,) vs. 0 mg/day (IQR 0-5), p=0.005], suggesting that the right timing of usage and the more appropriate dosage of corticosteroid are a key question for the better management of these patients. CONCLUSIONS Based on our results, patients with BS do not seem to be at a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe complications compared with the general population.","Mattioli, Irene; Bettiol, Alessandra; Silvestri, Elena; Urban, Maria Letizia; Palermo, Adalgisa; Fagni, Filippo; Malandrino, Danilo; Del Bianco, Alessandra; Prisco, Domenico; Emmi, Giacomo",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34128795/,21

We compared the adsorption and infectivity of one occluded and two nonoccluded viruses, Helicoverpa armigera single nucleopolyhedrovirus (HaSNPV) (Baculoviridae), Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) (Dicistroviridae), and Invertebrate iridescent virus 6 (IIV-6) (Iridoviridae), respectively, in mixtures with a selection of soil-forming minerals. The relative infective titers of HaSNPV and CrPV were unchanged or slightly reduced in the presence of different minerals compared to their titers in the absence of the mineral. In contrast, the infective titer of IIV-6 varied according to the mineral being tested. In adsorption studies, over 98% of HaSNPV occlusion bodies were adsorbed by all the minerals, and a particularly high affinity was observed with ferric oxide, attapulgite, and kaolinite. In contrast, the adsorption of CrPV and IIV-6 differed markedly with mineral type, with low affinity to bentonites and high affinity to ferric oxide and kaolinite. We conclude that interactions between soil-forming minerals and insect viruses appear to be most important in nucleopolyhedroviruses, followed by invertebrate iridescent viruses, and least important in CrPV, which may reflect the ecology of these pathogens. Moreover, soils with a high content of iron oxides or kaolinite would likely represent highly effective reservoirs for insect-pathogenic viruses.","Christian, Peter D; Richards, Andrew R; Williams, Trevor",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16820456/,21
192361,"Replication of rat coronaviruses in intestinal cell line, RCN-9, derived from F344 rats.",1996,"Fourteen ORFs have been identified in the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome. ORF 3a of SARS-CoV codes for a recently identified transmembrane protein, but its function remains unknown. In this study we confirmed the 3a protein expression and investigated its localization at the surface of SARS-CoV-infected or 3a-cDNA-transfected cells. Our experiments showed that recombinant 3a protein can form a homotetramer complex through interprotein disulfide bridges in 3a-cDNA-transfected cells, providing a clue to ion channel function. The putative ion channel activity of this protein was assessed in 3a-complement RNA-injected Xenopus oocytes by two-electrode voltage clamp. The results suggest that 3a protein forms a potassium sensitive channel, which can be efficiently inhibited by barium. After FRhK-4 cells were transfected with an siRNA, which is known to suppress 3a expression, followed by infection with SARS-CoV, the released virus was significantly decreased, whereas the replication of the virus in the infected cells was not changed. Our observation suggests that SARS-CoV ORF 3a functions as an ion channel that may promote virus release. This finding will help to explain the highly pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV and to develop new strategies for treatment of SARS infection.","Lu, Wei; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Xu, Ke; Schwarz, Wolfgang; Du, Lanying; Wong, Charlotte K L; Chen, Jiadong; Duan, Shuming; Deubel, Vincent; Sun, Bing",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16894145/,21
192428,Assessment the Efficiency of the Constructed Minigenome of Rabies Virus using PV Strain as Helper Virus.,2016,"The potential for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) replication interference was evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Fourteen-day-old broiler chickens were inoculated via eyedrop with live commercial vaccine strains of IBV and NDV alone or in combination to directly evaluate IBV and NDV replication in the trachea at 1, 3, and 5 days after vaccination. Commercial NDV vaccine strains used were B1, VG/GA, and C2. The vaccine strains of IBV tested were Massachusetts (Mass) and Arkansas (Ark). The NDV + Mass vaccines used were commercially manufactured combined products. The NDV + Ark vaccines used were commercial vaccines manufactured as single entity products that were administered by eyedrop to opposite eyes of each chicken. As measured by qRT-PCR, the replication of NDV strains B1, VG/GA, and C2 did not interfere with the growth of IBV Mass and Ark strain vaccines in the combined vaccine treatment groups. Combination vaccinations using B1 and VG/GA did not interfere with IBV immunity based on challenge or serum antibody production. In the C2 + Mass vaccination trial, IBV immunity after challenge was reduced, but it did not seem to be a result of reduced Mass vaccine growth or the ability of the Mass vaccine to induce serum IBV antibody. In contrast, the replication of IBV strains Mass and Ark interfered with the growth of NDV strains B1, VG/GA, and C2 as measured by qRT-PCR. However, interference with NDV replication was not reflected in a reduction in Newcastle disease challenge of immunity findings when combination Mass + NDV products manufactured by vaccine companies were tested. Moreover, NDV immunity was not compromised in two of three trials using single entity vaccines of NDV and Ark IBV vaccines manufactured separately but administered simultaneously. However, in one trial, NDV immunity was decreased where a NDV single entity product (C2) was given with an IBV single entity Ark vaccine. This finding emphasizes the importance of using manufactured combination vaccines whenever possible to avoid potential interference.","Gelb, J; Ladman, B S; Licata, M J; Shapiro, M H; Campion, L R",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18251404/,21

This has led to the development of different surgical techniques to restore knee stability. MATERIAL Y METHODS Clinical study, randomized, blind comparing ACL reconstruction techniques with One Band and «U-Two» using clinical scales and arthrometria with KT-1000 and Pivot Shift Meter. RESULTS Of 36 patients, 52.94% was drawn for the One Band technique and 47.06% for «U-Two». 11.76% of patients had a displacement greater than 11mm in the affected knee with KT-1000. 8.82% showed an equal anterior displacement on both knees. One patient had a major previous displacement after reconstruction surgery with the one band technique, but with improvement on clinical scales. Pivot Shift measurements found a difference in displacement greater than 4,000 m/s on the X axis following the One Band technique compared to the healthy knee calculating integrals, while with U-Two the difference was less than 600 m/s. On the Y axis a difference of 3,500 m/s was found between the healthy and the injured leg, which decreases to less than 2,000 m/s after reconstruction using U-Two technique. CONCLUSIONS Differences have been found throughout the study in patient evolution, indicating that repair using the U-Dos technique has better results in recovering the anteroposterior and rotational stability of the affected limb.","Berumen-Nafarrate, E; Carmona-González, J; Tonche-Ramos, J J; Carmona-Máynez, O; Aguirre-Madrid, A; Moreno-Brito, V; Leal-Berumen, I",Acta ortopedica mexicana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767879/,21

195184,Clinical aspects of immunosuppression in poultry.,2010,"Early during the infection process, rotavirus causes the shutoff of cell protein synthesis, with the nonstructural viral protein NSP3 playing a vital role in the phenomenon. In this work, we have found that the translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) in infected cells becomes phosphorylated early after virus infection and remains in this state throughout the virus replication cycle, leading to a further inhibition of cell protein synthesis. Under these restrictive conditions, however, the viral proteins and some cellular proteins are efficiently translated. The phosphorylation of eIF2alpha was shown to depend on the synthesis of three viral proteins, VP2, NSP2, and NSP5, since in cells in which the expression of any of these three proteins was knocked down by RNA interference, the translation factor was not phosphorylated. The modification of this factor is, however, not needed for the replication of the virus, since mutant cells that produce a nonphosphorylatable eIF2alpha sustained virus replication as efficiently as wild-type cells. In uninfected cells, the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha induces the formation of stress granules, aggregates of stalled translation complexes that prevent the translation of mRNAs. In rotavirus-infected cells, even though eIF2alpha is phosphorylated these granules are not formed, suggesting that the virus prevents the assembly of these structures to allow the translation of its mRNAs. Under these conditions, some of the cellular proteins that form part of these structures were found to change their intracellular localization, with some of them having dramatic changes, like the poly(A) binding protein, which relocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in infected cells, a relocation that depends on the viral protein NSP3.","Montero, Hilda; Rojas, Margarito; Arias, Carlos F; López, Susana",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18032499/,21

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of new-onset occupational HE during the COVID-19 outbreak in healthcare workers (HCWs) and the clinical course, clinical features, and risk factors of occupational hand eczema (HE). A total of 159 volunteer HCWs (female: n=112; male: n=47, mean age=35.55±7.03 years) working in a pandemic hospital were included. Participants were questioned in terms of daily hand hygiene, use of gloves, and signs and symptoms associated with HE before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. HCWs were divided into two groups classified as non-COVID and COVID, according to the unit they worked in. In our study, 55 participants reported new-onset signs and/or symptoms associated with HE during the COVID-19 pandemic. 59 participants described an increase in signs and/or symptoms associated with HE. The presence of newly-formed or increased signs and/or symptoms associated with HE was found to be 71.7%. A significant increase in dryness, itching, pain/burning, erythema, and scaling was observed (P<0.05). No difference was found between the COVID and non-COVID groups in terms of newly formed and/or increased signs and symptoms (P>0.05). The study included a limited number of participants, and the participants self-reported the signs and symptoms associated with HE. During the COVID-19 period, there has been a significant increase in the signs and symptoms of occupational HE as a result of increased hand hygiene practices in HCWs.","Doğan, Esra İnan; Kurt, Birgül Özkesici",Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34477059/,21

195776,Transcriptional regulation of cytosol and membrane alanyl-aminopeptidase in human T cell subsets.,2003,"Since an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was averted in 2004, many novel coronaviruses have been recognized from different species, including humans. Bats have provided the most diverse assemblages of coronaviruses, suggesting that they may be the natural reservoir. Continued virological surveillance has proven to be the best way to avert this infectious disease at the source. Here we provide the first description of a previously unidentified coronavirus lineage detected from wild Asian leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) and Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) during virological surveillance in southern China. Partial genome analysis revealed a typical coronavirus genome but with a unique putative accessory gene organization. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein structural proteins and the two conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, of these novel coronaviruses were most closely related to those of group 3 coronaviruses identified from birds, while the spike protein gene was most closely related to that of group 1 coronaviruses from mammals. However, these viruses always fell into an outgroup phylogenetic relationship with respect to other coronaviruses and had low amino acid similarity to all known coronavirus groups, indicating that they diverged early in the evolutionary history of coronaviruses. These results suggest that these viruses may represent a previously unrecognized evolutionary pathway, or possibly an unidentified coronavirus group. This study demonstrates the importance of systematic virological surveillance in market animals for understanding the evolution and emergence of viruses with infectious potential.","Dong, B Q; Liu, W; Fan, X H; Vijaykrishna, D; Tang, X C; Gao, F; Li, L F; Li, G J; Zhang, J X; Yang, L Q; Poon, L L M; Zhang, S Y; Peiris, J S M; Smith, G J D; Chen, H; Guan, Y",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17459938/,21

The objective of this work was to look for if the socio-economic conditions and the policy of budgetary expenditure followed by the different Spanish autonomous communities have incidence, by themselves, on the mortality rate caused by the SARS-CoV-2. METHODS Econometric research based on Multiple Linear Regression to determine the direct cause-effect relationship between the dependent variable, mortality associated with COVID-19, with explanatory variables of the health budget and socio-economic type. RESULTS The number of deaths caused by COVID-19 has a positive relationship with the rate of GDP per capita and inversely with expenditure on hospital and specialized services, teaching and IRMs and with the resources allocated to health over the last nine years. A reduction in any of these health budget variables leads to an increase in mortality caused by COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 mortality rate has hit the wealthiest autonomous communities hardest but, above all, has hit those that, although richer, applied more restrictive budgetary measures in the period 2010-2018.","Ramón-Dangla, Remedios; Rico-Gómez, M Luisa; Issa-Khozouz, Ramzi",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33664220/,21
196592,The Golgi sorting domain of coronavirus E1 protein.,1991,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE In February 2003, a newly emerged infectious disease was described, the etiology of which was initially unknown. It is referred to under the term SARS. In the beginning, it spread in some regions South-East Asia. Import infections appeared in many other parts of the world. Based on the first cases in Germany, this report illustrates the clinical appearance, the diagnostic results and the management of this new disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS We analysed the data of two patients with SARS and one suspected patient. The results of radiological, laboratory, microbiological and physical examinations were abstracted and compared with the data obtained in other regions. RESULTS Two of the three patients under our care developed SARS disease. This is characterised by fever of sudden onset lasting for more than 5 days, rapidly changing consolidations in chest x-ray not affected by antimicrobial therapy, leuko-, lympho- as well as thrombopenia with a compromised pulmonary function later in the course. Close contacts with SARS patients does not regularly result in full development of the disease. Secretion of a coronavirus could be detected in respiratory samples during the febrile phase and in feces for a longer time. It is still an open question whether bedrest and antibiotic prophylaxis by themselves or an additional administration of ribavirin and corticosteroids can improve the outcome. CONCLUSION SARS is a new and highly contagious lung disease. It is crucial to be able to recognize the clinical appearance and the diagnostic features of this disease at an early stage, in order to prevent a further dissemination of the disease.","Rickerts, V; Wolf, T; Rottmann, C; Preiser, W; Drosten, C; Jakobi, V; Leong, H N; Brodt, H R",Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12748900/,21
196837,Initial sequence and comparative analysis of the cat genome.,2007,"The recent emergence of several new coronaviruses, including the etiological cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome, has significantly increased the importance of understanding virus-host cell interactions of this virus family. We used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 as a model to gain insight into how coronaviruses affect the type I alpha/beta interferon (IFN) system. We demonstrate that MHV is resistant to type I IFN. Protein kinase R (PKR) and the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor are not phosphorylated in infected cells. The RNase L activity associated with 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase is not activated or is blocked, since cellular RNA is not degraded. These results are consistent with lack of protein translation shutoff early following infection. We used a well-established recombinant vaccinia virus (VV)-based expression system that lacks the viral IFN antagonist E3L to screen viral genes for their ability to rescue the IFN sensitivity of the mutant. The nucleocapsid (N) gene rescued VVDeltaE3L from IFN sensitivity. N gene expression prevents cellular RNA degradation and partially rescues the dramatic translation shutoff characteristic of the VVDeltaE3L virus. However, it does not prevent PKR phosphorylation. The results indicate that the MHV N protein is a type I IFN antagonist that likely plays a role in circumventing the innate immune response.","Ye, Ye; Hauns, Kevin; Langland, Jeffrey O; Jacobs, Bertram L; Hogue, Brenda G",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17182678/,21

MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective observational study carried out at the Na Bulovce Hospital from the beginning of the pandemic until November 2020 included patients (1) who had symptoms compatible with COVID-19; (2) whose nasopharyngeal swab PCR tests in the presence of acute respiratory infection symptoms yielded two consecutive negative results; (3) in whom SARS-CoV-2 infection was subsequently confirmed by serology. Basic demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory test results, X-ray findings and timing of virological tests were analysed for these patients. RESULTS Seventeen patients met the inclusion criteria, 14 men and three women, aged 19-84 years with a median of 59 years, of whom 14 were hospitalized and three were treated as outpatients. Only seven patients were aware of the previous contact with an infected person. The main symptoms were fever, cough, headache, weakness, fatigue and shortness of breath. Pneumonia was found in 12 patients, four of whom developed respiratory insufficiency requiring ventilatory support. Most patients showed a uniform combination of haematological, biochemical and radio-logical findings: absence of eosinophils and increased polymorphonuclear/lymphocyte ratio; elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase; elevation of CRP without rise of procalcitonin; typical chest CT or X-ray findings. All patients recovered. Coronavirus antigen test was performed in six patients, with all of them testing negative. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed serologically by the detection of specific IgG and IgA in all 17 patients and also IgM in six patients, not before day 8 of the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that some patients with acute COVID-19 may test repeatedly negative by nasopharyngeal swab PCR. These cases should be interpreted as a low viral load in the upper respiratory tract rather than false negativity of PCR. Such alternative is not envisaged in the algorithms used. Considering our results, the following recommendation can be made: If, despite negative PCR tests, COVID-19 is still suspected based on clinical symptoms and epidemiological evidence, preliminary diagnosis can be made on the basis of comprehensive assessment of the laboratory test and X-ray findings. Final confirmation of the aetiology relies on serological tests performed two weeks after the onset of symptoms.","Beneš, J; Džupová, O; Poláková, A; Sojková, N","Epidemiologie, mikrobiologie, imunologie : casopis Spolecnosti pro epidemiologii a mikrobiologii Ceske lekarske spolecnosti J.E.

197168,[Unique mechanism of coronavirus mRNA transcription].,1996,"The anodic dissolution of aluminum metal was investigated in the Lewis acidic chloroaluminate ionic liquid, aluminum chloride-1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride. The investigation was conducted on aluminum rotating disk electrodes as a function of potential, ionic liquid composition, and temperature. Two different dissolution mechanisms were realized. At modest overpotentials, dissolution takes place under mixed kinetic-mass transport control. However, as the overpotential is increased to induce higher dissolution rates and/or the ionic liquid is made more acidic, the dissolution reaction transitions to a potential-independent passivation-like process ascribed to the formation of a porous solid layer of AlCl3(s). At a fixed temperature and composition, the limiting passivation current density displays Levich behavior and also scales linearly with the concentration of AlCl4 - in the ionic liquid. The heterogeneous kinetics of the Al dissolution reaction were measured in the active dissolution potential regime. The exchange current densities were independent of the composition of the ionic liquid, and the anodic transfer coefficients were close to zero and seemed to be independent of the Al grain size.","Wang, Chen; Creuziger, Adam; Stafford, Gery; Hussey, Charles L",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831360/,21

Recanalization to thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade 2 (n = 6) or 3 (n = 12) flow was achieved in 18 patients (90% revascularization rate). Good outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of ≤2) was obtained in 10 patients (50%) at 30 days. Here, we report the 2-year clinical follow-up data for patients enrolled in that prospective study. METHODS Study patients were scheduled for examinations 2 years postprocedure at which time mRS and Barthel indices were obtained. RESULTS Among 12 survivors at 2 years, 11 of the 20 (55%) study patients improved to mRS score ≤2 and 1 (5%) patient was disabled with an mRS 4. Of the 11 patients with mRS 0-2 scores, 10 patients had a Barthel index of 100, and the 11th had a Barthel index of 95. One patient improved from mRS 3 to 2 during the interval between the 6- and 12-month postintervention evaluations after intervention. Eight of 13 (62%) survivors underwent follow-up imaging at 6 months without evidence of instent stenosis or thrombosis. CONCLUSION At 2 years of follow-up, improvement in quality of life after acute stroke intervention was sustained; and 11 of 12 (92%) survivors had an excellent functional outcome. Improvement in functional status can occur even up to 1 year after stroke intervention. These results 2 years after acute stroke intervention demonstrate sustained benefit from acute intervention.

However, in times of pandemic virus diseases, it is necessary that asthma and allergic rhinitis are well controlled.

At the early stages of the pandemic, Ecuador was one of the most affected countries in Latin America. The objective of this study was to assess the levels of depression, anxiety and stress in the Ecuadorian general population during the social isolation period due to COVID-19. METHODS: A web-based survey consisting of 31 short-answer and multiple-choice questions was administered to the general population from April 22-May 3, 2020. Mental health status was assessed through the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) questionnaire. Ordinal logistic analyses were used to identify potential risk factors associated with the severity of mental health issues. RESULTS: A total of 626 individuals were included. Most of them were females (60.5%), and their mean age was 29.6 ± 11.7 years. Approximately 17.7% of the respondents had moderate to very severe levels of depression, 30.7% had similar levels of anxiety, and 14.2% experienced stress. Female sex, younger age, student status, and having a relative diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Ordinal regression models showed that being a student was a risk factor for having more severe levels of depression (OR = 3.67; 95% CI = 2.56-5.26, p: 0.0001), anxiety (OR= 1.86; 95% CI= 1.35-2.55, p: 0.0001), and stress (OR = 2.17; 95% CI= 1.47-3.19, p: 0.0001). Having a relative with COVID-19 was also found to be a risk factor only for depression (OR= 1.70; 95% CI= 1.03-2.80, p: 0.036) and anxiety (OR = 2.17; 95% CI= 1.35-3.47, p: 0.001). Additionally, male sex, older age, and having more children were found to be protective factors for the three conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that social isolation due to the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted the mental health of the general population in Ecuador. We identified potential risk and protective factors that could serve as a foundation from which to develop psychological strategies to safeguard the mental health of our population during the current pandemic.","Mautong, Hans; Gallardo-Rumbea, Jorge Andrés; Alvarado-Villa, Geovanny Efraín; Fernández-Cadena, Juan Carlos; Andrade-Molina, Derly; Orellana-Román, Carlos Enrique; Cherrez-Ojeda, Iván",BMC Psychiatry,,21

223081,Simulated annealing with adaptive cooling rates,2020,"BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCWs) represent a high risk population for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. AIM: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs, and to find out the factors that are associated with this seroprevalence. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were applied for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Databases including PubMed/MEDLINE and pre-print services (medR&#967;iv and bioR&#967;iv) were searched from inception up to August 24, 2020. FINDINGS: Forty-nine studies, including 127,480 HCWs met the inclusion criteria. The estimated overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs was 8.7% (95% CI: 6.7-10.9%). Seroprevalence was higher in studies that were conducted in North America (12.7%) compared to those in Europe (8.5%), Africa (8.2), and Asia (4%). Meta-regression showed that increased sensitivity of antibodies test was associated with increased seroprevalence. The following factors were associated with seropositivity: male gender, Black, Asian, and Hispanic HCWs, work in a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) unit, patient-related work, frontline health care workers, health care assistants, personal protective equipment shortage, self-reported belief for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, previous positive polymerase chain reaction test, and household contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs is high. Excellent adherence to infection prevention and control measures, sufficient and adequate personal protective equipment, and early recognition, identification and isolation of HCWs that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 are imperative to decrease the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Galanis, Petros; Vraka, Irene; Fragkou, Despoina; Bilali, Angeliki; Kaitelidou, Daphne",J. hosp. infect,,21
224916,Efficient Transient Expression of Recombinant Proteins Using DNA Viral Vectors in Freshwater Microalgal Species,2021,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been adversely affecting people's health globally. To diminish the effect of this widespread pandemic, it is essential to detect COVID-19 cases as quickly as possible. Chest radiographs are less expensive and are a widely available imaging modality for detecting chest pathology compared with CT images. They play a vital role in early prediction and developing treatment plans for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 chest infection patients. In this paper, a novel shape-dependent Fibonacci-p patterns-based feature descriptor using a machine learning approach is proposed. Computer simulations show that the presented system (1) increases the effectiveness of differentiating COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal conditions, (2) is effective on small datasets, and (3) has faster inference time compared to deep learning methods with comparable performance. Computer simulations are performed on two publicly available datasets; (a) the Kaggle dataset, and (b) the COVIDGR dataset. To assess the performance of the presented system, various evaluation parameters, such as accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, and f1-score are used. Nearly 100% differentiation between normal and COVID-19 radiographs is observed for the three-class classification scheme using the lung area-specific Kaggle radiographs. While Recall of 72.65 ± 6.83 and specificity of 77.72 ± 8.06 is observed for the COVIDGR dataset.","Panetta, Karen; Sanghavi, Foram; Agaian, Sos; Madan, Neel",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,,21
226790,Utility Evaluation of Porcine Enteroids as PDCoV Infection Model in vitro,2020,"Background: In many low- and middle-income countries, where vaccinations will be delayed and healthcare systems are underdeveloped, the COVID-19 pandemic will continue for the foreseeable future. Mortality scales can aid frontline providers in low-resource settings (LRS) in identifying those at greatest risk of death so that limited resources can be directed towards those in greatest need and unnecessary loss of life is prevented. While many prognostication tools have been developed for, or applied to, COVID-19 patients, no tools to date have been purpose-designed for, and validated in, LRS. Objectives: This study aimed to develop a pragmatic tool to assist LRS frontline providers in evaluating in-hospital mortality risk using only easy-to-obtain demographic and clinical inputs. Methods: Machine learning was used on data from a retrospective cohort of Sudanese COVID-19 patients at two government referral hospitals to derive contextually appropriate mortality indices for COVID-19, which were then assessed by C-indices. Findings: Data from 467 patients were used to derive two versions of the AFEM COVID-19 Mortality Scale (AFEM-CMS), which evaluates in-hospital mortality risk using demographic and clinical inputs that are readily obtainable in hospital receiving areas. Both versions of the tool include age, sex, number of comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale, respiratory rate, and systolic blood pressure; in settings with pulse oximetry, oxygen saturation is included and in settings without access, heart rate is included. The AFEM-CMS showed good discrimination: the model including pulse oximetry had a C-statistic of 0.775 (95% CI: 0.737-0.813) and the model excluding it had a C-statistic of 0.719 (95% CI: 0.678-0.760). Conclusions: In the face of an enduring pandemic in many LRS, the AFEM-CMS serves as a practical solution to aid frontline providers in effectively allocating healthcare resources. The tool's generalisability is likely narrow outside of similar extremely LRS settings, and further validation studies are essential prior to broader use.","Pigoga, J L; Omer, Y O; Wallis, L A",Ann Glob Health,,21
227650,LipidCreator workbench to probe the lipidomic landscape,2020,"AIMS: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The disease severity in 2019 novel coronavirus (Covid 19) infection has varied from mild self-limiting flu-like illness to fulminant pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. Since DM and Covid 19 infection are closely associated with inflammatory status, mean platelet volume (MPV) was suggested to be useful in predicting Covid infection onset. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic role of MPV in Covid patients with diabetes. METHODS: A total of 640 subjects (160 Covid patients with type 2 diabetes, 160 healthy controls, 160 patients with non-spesific infections and 160 Covid patients without type 2 diabetes) enrolled in the study. RESULTS: MPV was significantly higher (11.21 ± 0.61 fL) as compared to the results from the last routine visits of the the same individuals with diabetes (10.59 ± 0.96 fL) (p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: MPV could be used as a simple and cost-effective tool to predict the Covid infection in subjects with diabetes in primary care.","Ozder, Aclan",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,21

MBS has the potential to become an aerosol generating procedure (AGP) as it may trigger a cough or necessitate suctioning which may result in transmission of C-ARI putting patients and health care workers at risk. Regulations and best practices from international and US governmental and commercial agencies were reviewed. This review led to the multidisciplinary development of best practices of the safety measures and structural requirements to avoid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or other C-ARIs when performing MBS. Implementation of these best practices resulted in structural changes to the fluoroscopy suite and protocol workflows. This enabled patients with COVID-19 to undergo MBS while maintaining patient and staff safety including mitigation of potential risk of onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to other patients. With proper modifications, MBS can be safely performed on patients with C-ARI such as COVID-19 while maintaining patient and health care worker (HCW) safety.","Goldman, Alice R; Pahade, Jay K; Langton-Frost, Nicole A; Hodges, Chiquacta A; Taylor, Amy M; Bova, Gregory; Azadi, Javad R",Abdom Radiol (NY),,21

232127,Taking out the trash,2020,"Remote in-home infant monitoring technologies hold great promise for increasing the scalability and safety of infant research (including in regard to the current Covid-19 pandemic), but remain rarely employed. These technologies hold a number of fundamental challenges and ethical concerns that need addressing to aid the success of this fast-growing field. In particular, the responsible development of such technologies requires caregiver input. We conducted a survey of the opinions of 410 caregivers on the viability, privacy and data access of remote in-home monitoring technologies and study designs. Infant-friendly wearable devices (such as sensing body suits) were viewed favourably. Caregivers were marginally more likely to accept video and audio recording in the home if data was anonymised (through automated processing) at point of collection, particularly when observations were lengthy. Caregivers were more open to international data sharing for anonymous data. Caregivers were interested in viewing all types of data, but were particularly keen to access video and audio recordings for censoring purposes (i.e., to delete data segments). Taken together, our results indicate generally positive attitudes to remote in-home monitoring technologies and studies for infant research but highlight specific considerations such as safety, privacy and family practicalities (e.g. multiple caregivers, visitors and varying schedules) that must be taken into account when developing future studies.","Fish, Laurel A; Jones, Emily J H",PLoS One,,21

There has been no systematic study as to whether Treponema pallidum infection induces septic cardiomyopathy, and we are the first to report this possibility. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases of a 48-year-old man and a 57-year-old man who were diagnosed with syphilis-related septic cardiomyopathy. The diagnosis of cardiomyopathy was made based on elevation of cardiogenic markers and decrease in ejection fraction evaluated by echocardiography. Screen for infective pathogens was negative except for syphilis, which supported our diagnosis. The two patients recovered following effective anti-syphilis treatment and advanced life support technology. Syphilis serology became negative after treatment. CONCLUSION: Syphilis has the potential to cause septic cardiomyopathy. Clinicians should consider Treponema pallidum in cases of septic cardiomyopathy with unknown pathogens. However, the specific pathophysiological mechanism of syphilis-associated septic cardiomyopathy has not been elucidated, and more specific studies are needed.","Guo, Shiqi; Guo, Qiang",BMC Infect Dis,,21

The objective of this study was to characterize the demographics, clinical manifestations, and outcomes in this unique patient population. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted between 24th February 2020 and 20th April 2020. All consecutive patients in the entire State of Kuwait diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO guidelines and admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital were included. Patients received standardized investigations and treatments. Multivariable analysis was used to determine the associations between risk factors and outcomes (admission to intensive care and/or mortality). Findings: Of 1096 patients, the median age was 41 years and 81% of patients were male. Most patients were asymptomatic on admission (46.3%), of whom 35 later developed symptoms, and 59.7% had no signs of infection. Only 3.6% of patients required an ICU admission and 1.7% were dead at the study's cutoff date. On multivariable analysis, the risk factors found to be significantly associated with admission to intensive care were age above 50 years old, a qSOFA score above 0, smoking, elevated CRP and elevated procalcitonin levels. Asthma, smoking and elevated procalcitonin levels correlated significantly with mortality in our cohort.","Almazeedi, Sulaiman; Al-Youha, Sarah; Jamal, Mohammad H; Al-Haddad, Mohannad; Al-Muhaini, Ali; Al-Ghimlas, Fahad; Al-Sabah, Salman",EClinicalMedicine,,21
256476,Molecular detection of canine respiratory pathogens between 2017 and 2018 in Japan,2020,"Within a year of its emergence, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into a pandemic. What has emerged during the past 1 year is that, apart from its potentially fatal respiratory presentation from which the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) derives its name, it presents with a myriad of gastrointestinal (GI) and liver manifestations. Expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor throughout the GI tract and liver, which is the receptor for the SARS-CoV-2, may be responsible for the GI and liver manifestations. Besides acting directly via the ACE-2 receptor, the virus triggers a potent immune response, which might have a role in pathogenesis. The virus leads to derangement in liver function tests in close to 50% of the patients. The impact of these derangements in patients with a normal underlying liver seems to be innocuous. Severe clinical presentations include acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure in a patient with chronic liver disease, leading to high mortality. Evolving data suggests that, contrary to intuition, liver transplant recipients and patients with autoimmune liver disease on immunosuppression do not have increased mortality. The exact mechanism underlying why immunosuppressed patients fare well as compared to other patients remains to be deciphered. With newer variants of COVID-19, which can spread faster than the original strain, the data on hepatic manifestations needs to be updated to keep a step ahead of the virus.","Elhence, A.; Vaishnav, M.; Biswas, S.; Chauhan, A.; Anand, A.; Shalimar,",Journal of Clinical &amp; Translational Hepatology,,21

All these applications stem from their unique physical and chemical properties, which remain understood to only a limited extent. Among the issues of greatest importance is the extent to which RTILs exist as dissociated ionic species and the length scales over which some types of organizations are seen to exist in them. In this Invited Feature Article, we review the current understanding of organization in this family of materials, where opportunities lie in terms of deepening our understanding, and what potential applications would benefit from gaining such knowledge.","Wang, Yufeng; Parvis, Fatemeh; Hossain, Md Iqbal; Ma, Ke; Jarosová, Romana; Swain, Greg M; Blanchard, Gary J",Langmuir,,21

267509,Protein interaction with dendrimer monolayers: Energy and surface topology,2020,"PURPOSE: To comprehensively evaluate the incidences of abnormal neuroimaging findings in patients with COVID-19 via a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHOD: PubMed-MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for original articles reporting imaging findings of the brain in adult patients with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and October 9, 2020. Abnormal neuroimaging findings were categorized as (1) cerebral microhemorrhages, (2) acute spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), (3) acute to subacute infarcts, and (4) encephalitis or encephalopathy. Pooled incidences of neuroimaging findings were assessed using random-effects modeling. Between-study heterogeneity was explored by using the &#967;2 statistic for pooled incidences and the inconsistency index I2. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies. Subgroup meta-regression analysis was performed to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty-one eligible papers, including 2125 patients, were identified. The pooled incidences of cerebral microhemorrhages, acute spontaneous ICH, acute/subacute infarcts, and encephalitis/encephalopathy were 6.9 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 4.9 %-8.9 %), 5.4 % (95 % CI, 3.1 %-7.6 %), 24.0 % (95 % CI, 16.1 %-31.8 %), and 3.3 % (95 % CI, 1.9 %-4.7 %), respectively. Substantial heterogeneities were noted for all neuroimaging findings (I2 = 87 %-97 %). Significant publication biases were present in the pooled incidences. In the subgroup meta-regression analysis, patients with mean or median ages over 65 years showed a significantly lower incidence of encephalitis/encephalopathy (P < 0.001). Furthermore, studies reported that patients in ICU had significantly higher incidences of cerebral microhemorrhages (Pâ¯<â¯0.001) and encephalitis/encephalopathy (Pâ¯<â¯0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Considerable incidences of abnormal neuroimaging findings have been reported in patients with COVID-19. Acute to subacute cerebral infarction was the most prevalent neuroimaging finding.","Choi, Yangsean; Lee, Min Kyoung",Eur J Radiol,,21

To investigate the use of the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) classification and chest CT Involvement Score (CT-IS) in COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 280 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia in a tertiary hospital in Turkey. All patients underwent non-contrast CT chest imaging. Two radiologists interpreted all CT images according to CO-RADS classification without knowing the clinical features, laboratory findings. We used CT involvement score (CT-IS) for assessing chest CT images of COVID-19 patients. Also, we examined the relationship between CT-IS and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Of the patients, 111(39.6%) had positive real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results. CO-RADS 5 group patients had statistically significant positive RT-PCR results than the other groups (P < 0.001). All of the CO-RADS 2 group patients (30) had negative RT-PCR results. The mean total CT-IS in CO-RADS 2 group was 3.4 ± 2.8. The mean total CT-IS in CO-RADS 5 group was 8.2 ± 4.7. Total CT-IS was statistically significantly different among CO-RADS groups (P < 0.001). The mean total CT-IS was statistically significantly different between survivors and patients died of COVID-19 pneumonia (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CO-RADS is useful in detecting COVID-19 disease, even if RT-PCR testing is negative. CT-IS is also helpful as an imaging tool for evaluation of the severity and extent of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Özel, Mehmet; Aslan, Aydin; Araç, Songül",,,21
269243,"The taxonomy, host range and pathogenicity of coronaviruses and other viruses in the Nidovirales order",2021,"Research has shown that sleep is beneficial for the long-term retention of memories. According to theories of memory consolidation, memories are gradually reorganized, becoming supported by widespread, distributed cortical networks, particularly during postencoding periods of sleep. However, the effects of sleep on the organization of memories in the hippocampus itself remains less clear. In a 3-d study, participants encoded separate lists of word-image pairs differing in their opportunity for sleep-dependent consolidation. Pairs were initially studied either before or after an overnight sleep period, and were then restudied in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan session. We used multivariate pattern similarity analyses to examine fine-grained effects of consolidation on memory representations in the hippocampus. We provide evidence for a dissociation along the long axis of the hippocampus that emerges with consolidation, such that representational patterns for object-word memories initially formed prior to sleep become differentiated in anterior hippocampus and more similar, or overlapping, in posterior hippocampus. Differentiation in anterior hippocampal representations correlated with subsequent behavioral performance. Furthermore, representational overlap in posterior hippocampus correlated with the duration of intervening slow wave sleep. Together, these results demonstrate that sleep-dependent consolidation promotes the reorganization of memory traces along the long axis of the hippocampus.","Cowan, Emily T; Liu, Anli A; Henin, Simon; Kothare, Sanjeev; Devinsky, Orrin; Davachi, Lila",Learn Mem,,21

272475,Invasion of the Nervous System,2020,"With coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), we have witnessed a shift from public health to planetary health and a growing recognition of the importance of systems science in developing effective solutions against pandemics in the 21st century. COVID-19 and the history of frequent infectious outbreaks in the last two decades suggest that COVID-19 is likely a dry run for future ecological crises. Now is the right time to plan ahead and deploy the armamentarium of systems science scholarship for planetary health. The science of epigenomics, which investigates both genetic and nongenetic traits regarding heritable phenotypic alterations, and new approaches to understanding genome regulation in humans and pathogens offer veritable prospects to boost the global scientific capacities to innovate therapeutics and diagnostics against novel and existing infectious agents. Several reversible epigenetic alterations, such as chromatin remodeling and histone methylation, control and influence gene expression. COVID-19 lethality is linked, in part, to the cytokine storm, age, and status of the immune system in a given person. Additionally, due to reduced human mobility and daily activities, effects of the pandemic on the environment have been both positive and negative. For example, reduction in environmental pollution and lesser extraction from nature have potential positive corollaries on water and air quality. Negative effects include pollution as plastics and other materials were disposed in unconventional places and spaces in the course of the pandemic. I discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with the science of epigenomics, specifically with an eye to inform and prevent future ecological crises and pandemics that are looming on the horizon in the 21st century. In particular, this article underscores that epigenetics of both viruses and the host may influence virus infectivity and severity of attendant disease.","Dzobo, Kevin",OMICS,,21

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of transports of subjects with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 from sending hospitals to tertiary care hospitals in Boston. Follow-up data were obtained for patients transported between March 1st and April 20th, 2020. RESULTS: Of 254 charts identified, 250 patients were transported. Nine patients (3.5%) had cardiac arrest prior to transport. Twenty-nine (11.6%) had hypotension, 22 (8.8%) had a critical desaturation, and 4 (1.6%) had both en route. Hospital follow-up data were available for 189 patients. Of those intubated during their hospitalization, 44 (25.0%) had died, 59 (33.5%) had been extubated, and 13 (17.6%) had been discharged alive. For the subgroup with prior cardiac arrest, follow-up data available for 6. Of these 6, 2 died and 4 (66.7%) have been discharged alive. CONCLUSIONS: Few patients with COVID-19 had an adverse event in transport. The in-hospital mortality rate was 25%, with a 33.5% extubation rate. Patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest prior to transport had a 66.7% discharge rate among those transported to consortium hospitals.","Frakes, Michael A; Richards, Jeremy B; Cocchi, Michael N; Cohen, Ari; Cohen, Jason E; Dargin, James; Friedman, Franklin D; Kaye, Adam S; Rettig, Jordan S; Seethala, Raghu; Wilcox, Susan R",J Intensive Care Med,,21

274690,Snitches Get Stitches: On The Difficulty of Whistleblowing,2020-06-25,"The containment measures imposed during the first COVID-19 outbreak required economic, social, and behavioral changes to minimize the spread of the coronavirus. Some studies have focused on how personality predicts distinct patterns of adherence to protective measures with psychopathic and antisocial traits predicting reduced engagement in such measures. In this study we extended previous findings by analyzing how boldness, meanness, and disinhibition psychopathic traits relate with both risk perceptions and protective behaviors during the first COVID-19 outbreak. A sample of 194 individuals (24% male) engaged in the survey, were assessed for psychopathic traits with the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure, and completed a COVID-19 survey targeting risk perceptions (spread, risk of becoming infected, state anxiety toward the COVID-19, and perceived risk of specific behaviors) and frequency of protective behaviors (e.g., not engaging in social distancing). Overall results show that boldness predicts reduced estimate of COVID-19 spread, reduced perceived risk of becoming infected, reduced state anxiety toward COVID-19, and reduced frequency of protective behaviors. Exploratory mediation models suggest that risk perceptions are not significant mediators of the association between psychopathic traits and reduced engagement in protective behaviors. Our results unveil that psychopathic traits affect risk perceptions and the propensity to engage in protective measures, emphasizing the need to accommodate these personality features in the public health strategy to control the COVID-19 spread.","Paiva, T.

Crystallography gives the impression that proteins adopt a fixed shape, yet enzymes are functionally dynamic. Molecular dynamics offers the possibility of probing protein movement while predicting ligand binding. Accordingly, we choose the bacterial F1Fo ATP synthase Îµ subunit to unravel why ATP affinity by Îµ subunits from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus PS3 differs ~500-fold, despite sharing identical sequences at the ATP-binding site. METHODS: We first used the Bacillus PS3 Îµ subunit structure to model the B. subtilis Îµ subunit structure and used this to explore the utility of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the influence of residues outside the ATP binding site. To verify the MD predictions, point mutants were made and ATP binding studies were employed. RESULTS: MD simulations predicted that E102 in the B. subtilis Îµ subunit, outside of the ATP binding site, influences ATP binding affinity. Engineering E102 to alanine or arginine revealed a ~10 or ~54 fold increase in ATP binding, respectively, confirming the MD prediction that E102 drastically influences ATP binding affinity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal how MD can predict how changes in the ""second shell"" residues around substrate binding sites influence affinity in simple protein structures. Our results reveal why seemingly identical Îµ subunits in different ATP synthases have radically different ATP binding affinities. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study may lead to greater utility of molecular dynamics as a tool for protein design and exploration of protein design and function.","Krah, Alexander; van der Hoeven, Bas; Mestrom, Luuk; Tonin, Fabio; Knobel, Kirsten C C; Bond, Peter J; McMillan, Duncan G G",Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj,,21
282745,"Synthesis, Characterization, and Biological Evaluation of New Derivatives Targeting MbtI as Antitubercular Agents",2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a worldwide pandemic since March 2020. Although most patients complain of moderate or severe pain, these symptoms are generally underestimated and appropriate treatment is not applied. This study aims to guide physicians in selecting and ranking various alternatives for the treatment of pain in COVID-19 patients. However, the choice of treatment for pain requires the consideration of many different conflicting criteria. Therefore, we have studied this problem as a multicriteria decision-making problem. Throughout the solution procedure, first, the criteria and subcriteria affecting the preferences are defined. Then, weight values are determined with respect to these criteria, as they have different degrees of importance for the problem. At this stage, hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs) are used, and thus, experts can convey their ideas more accurately. In this first phase of the study, an HFLTS integrated Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is utilized. Subsequently, possible treatment alternatives are evaluated by using the Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method. According to the results obtained by considering expert evaluations, the most preferred treatment is the administration of paracetamol, followed by interventional treatments, opioids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), respectively. With this study, it is ensured that a more accurate method is followed by eliminating possible mistakes due to the subjective evaluations of experts in the process of determining pain treatment. This method can also be used in different patient and disease groups.","Batur Sir, G Didem; Sir, Ender",J Healthc Eng,,21

291087,Zoonotic spillover: Understanding basic aspects for better prevention,2021,"Background. Left ventricular thrombus (LVT) is a complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to localised haemostasis. LVT is typically seen 3-12 days following AMI and is seldom seen within the first 24 hours. LVT increases the risk of mortality due to systemic thromboembolism. Patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) are potentially hypercoagulable and this may promote early development of LVT. Case. A 50-year-old man with no past medical history was admitted with a severe diabetic ketoacidosis following a 4-day history of cough and fever. The patient tested positive for COVID-19 and required intensive care treatment for ventilation and haemofiltration. After returning to ward-based care, the patient developed chest pain and electrocadiographic changes consistent with an acute anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Emergency percutaneous coronary intervention was performed to the left anterior descending artery. However, the patient developed diuretic-resistant pulmonary oedema and a bedside echocardiogram revealed significant LVT despite only 4 hours of chest pain. The thrombus was associated with the anteroseptal wall of the left ventricle which was hypokinetic but not aneurysmal. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted, but the patient developed ipsilateral lower limb ischaemia due to the formation of thrombus in the femoral artery and irreversible cardiogenic shock from which he ultimately succumbed. Conclusion. COVID-19-positive patients are potentially hypercoagulable, and MI in this population may precipitate LVT earlier than expected. Consideration should be made for routine early screening of post-MI COVID-19 patients for LVT. If detected, anticoagulation may reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality in this high-risk group.","Sharma, Harish; George, Sudhakar",Case Rep. Cardiol.,,21

To target thinning these secretions requires understanding the physical properties that contribute to these tenacious secretions. Methods: We received surrogate consent from 11 patients with COVID-19 ARDS to collect an undiluted tracheal aspirate obtained as part of routine care. All samples were frozen at-80C immediately after collection and heat inactivated at 65C for 30 minutes to render them noninfectious prior to further analyses. These were compared with sputum collected from 4 patients with Cystic Fibrosis and 15 healthy controls. Clinical phenotypes of COVID patients included ARDS severity, treatments related to sputum clearance, and patient outcomes including length of mechanical ventilation and mortality. Sputum was characterized for percent solids, double strand DNA, and hyaluronin content. Results: Sputum samples were collected from 11 patients intubated with COVID-19 ARDS, with aspirates sampled between 2-18 days into their course. 63% of patients had thick secretions described by respiratory therapy, 81% had moderate or severe ARDS, and 90% had prolonged mechanical ventilation &gt; 14 days. We found that the physical characteristics of COVID-19 sputum are similar to CF sputum, with markedly higher percent solid, hyaluronin, and double strand DNA content than that seen in sputum from healthy controls (Figure 1). Conclusion: In this proof of concept study, we show the feasibility of measuring numerous physical characteristics of COVID-19 sputum. As expected, we found that percent solids, DNA content and hyaluronin were similar to the known thick secretions of CF, and markedly increased in comparison to sputum of healthy controls. We were unable to identify differences in outcomes in this small cohort, with collection of additional samples ongoing to improve power. Figure 1.

People with a smoking history have severe disease outcomes by COVID-19 infection. Epidemiological studies show that old age and pre-existing disease conditions (hypertension and diabetes) result in severe disease outcome and mortality amongst COVID-19 patients. Evidences suggest that the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 (causative agent of COVID-19) membrane spike has a high affinity towards the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor found on the host's lung epithelium. Likewise, TMPRSS2 protease has been shown to be crucial for viral activation thus facilitating the viral engulfment. The viral entry has been shown to cause 'cytokine storm' involving excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines including IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-7, IP-10, MCP-3 or GM-CSF, which is augmented by smoking.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional data were analysed using logistic regression and general linear models to assess associations between food security status and food skills, health literacy and the proportion of meals prepared at home, by gender. SETTING: Participants recruited from five Canadian cities (Vancouver (BC), Edmonton (AB), Toronto (ON), Montreal (QB) and Halifax (NS)) completed an online survey. PARTICIPANTS: 1389 men and 1340 women aged 16-30 years. RESULTS: Self-reported food skills were not associated with food security status (P > 0·05) among men or women.

327837,Self-assembled mRNA vaccines,2021,"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in December 2019, when the first cases were reported in Wuhan, China. The once-localized outbreak has since been declared a pandemic. As of April 24, 2020, there have been 2.7 million confirmed cases and nearly 200,000 deaths. Early warning systems using new technologies should be established to prevent or mitigate such events in the future. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the possibility of detecting the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 2019 using social media. METHODS: WeChat Index is a data service that shows how frequently a specific keyword appears in posts, subscriptions, and search over the last 90 days on WeChat, the most popular Chinese social media app. We plotted daily WeChat Index results for keywords related to SARS-CoV-2 from November 17, 2019, to February 14, 2020. RESULTS: WeChat Index hits for ""Feidian"" (which means severe acute respiratory syndrome in Chinese) stayed at low levels until 16 days ahead of the local authority's outbreak announcement on December 31, 2019, when the index increased significantly. The WeChat Index values persisted at relatively high levels from December 15 to 29, 2019, and rose rapidly on December 30, 2019, the day before the announcement. The WeChat Index hits also spiked for the keywords ""SARS,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""novel coronavirus,"" ""shortness of breath,"" ""dyspnea,"" and ""diarrhea,"" but these terms were not as meaningful for the early detection of the outbreak as the term ""Feidian"". CONCLUSIONS: By using retrospective infoveillance data from the WeChat Index, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in December 2019 could have been detected about two weeks before the outbreak announcement. WeChat may offer a new approach for the early detection of disease outbreaks.","Wang, Wenjun; Wang, Yikai; Zhang, Xin; Jia, Xiaoli; Li, Yaping; Dang, Shuangsuo",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,21
330703,Cryo-EM Structure of the Photosynthetic LH1-RC Complex from Rhodospirillum rubrum,2021,"Topical intra-nasal sprays are amongst the most commonly prescribed therapeutic options for sinonasal diseases in humans. However, inconsistency and ambiguity in instructions show a lack of definitive knowledge on best spray use techniques. In this study, we have identified a new usage strategy for nasal sprays available over-the-counter, that registers an average 8-fold improvement in topical delivery of drugs at diseased sites, when compared to prevalent spray techniques. The protocol involves re-orienting the spray axis to harness inertial motion of particulates and has been developed using computational fluid dynamics simulations of respiratory airflow and droplet transport in medical imaging-based digital models. Simulated dose in representative models is validated through in vitro spray measurements in 3D-printed anatomic replicas using the gamma scintigraphy technique. This work breaks new ground in proposing an alternative user-friendly strategy that can significantly enhance topical delivery inside human nose. While these findings can eventually translate into personalized spray usage instructions and hence merit a change in nasal standard-of-care, this study also demonstrates how relatively simple engineering analysis tools can revolutionize everyday healthcare. Finally, with respiratory mucosa as the initial coronavirus infection site, our findings are relevant to intra-nasal vaccines that are in-development, to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.","Basu, Saikat; Holbrook, Landon T; Kudlaty, Kathryn; Fasanmade, Olulade; Wu, Jihong; Burke, Alyssa; Langworthy, Benjamin W; Farzal, Zainab; Mamdani, Mohammed; Bennett, William D; Fine, Jason P; Senior, Brent A; Zanation, Adam M; Ebert, Charles S; Kimple, Adam J; Thorp, Brian D; Frank-Ito, Dennis O; Garcia, Guilherme J M; Kimbell, Julia S",Sci Rep,,21

333285,How the glucocorticoid receptor contributes to platinum-based therapy resistance in solid cancer,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly and become a pandemic. Caused by a novel human coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), severe COVID-19 is characterized by cytokine storm syndromes due to innate immune activation. Primary immunodeficiency (PID) cases represent a special patient population whose impaired immune system might make them susceptible to severe infections, posing a higher risk to COVID-19, but this could also lead to suppressed inflammatory responses and cytokine storm. It remains an open question as to whether the impaired immune system constitutes a predisposing or protective factor for PID patients when facing SARS-CoV-2 infection. After literature review, it was found that, similar to other patient populations with different comorbidities, PID patients may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Their varied immune status, however, may lead to different disease severity and outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. PID patients with deficiency in antiviral innate immune signaling [eg, Toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR7, or interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)] or interferon signaling (IFNAR2) may be linked to severe COVID-19. Because of its anti-infection, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects, routine intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may provide some protective effects to the PID patients.","Liu, Benjamin M; Hill, Harry R",J Interferon Cytokine Res,,21

Confirmed modes of viral transmission are primarily, but not exclusively, contact with contaminated environmental surfaces and aerosolization. Evidence-based improvement strategies for attenuation of residual environmental contamination involve a combination of deep cleaning with surface disinfectants and ultraviolet light (UV-C). (1) Place alcohol-based hand rubs on the intravenous (IV) pole to the left of the provider. Double glove during induction. (2) Place a wire basket lined with a zip closure plastic bag on the IV pole to the right of the provider. Place all contaminated instruments in the bag (eg, laryngoscope blades and handles) and close. Designate and maintain clean and dirty areas. After induction of anesthesia, wipe down all equipment and surfaces with disinfection wipes that contain a quaternary ammonium compound and alcohol. Use a top-down cleaning sequence adequate to reduce bioburden. Treat operating rooms using UV-C. (3) Decolonize patients using preprocedural chlorhexidine wipes, 2 doses of nasal povidone-iodine within 1 hour of incision, and chlorhexidine mouth rinse. (4) Create a closed lumen IV system and use hub disinfection. (5) Provide data feedback by surveillance of Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter spp. (ESKAPE) transmission. (6) To reduce the use of surgical masks and to reduce potential COVID-19 exposure, use relatively long (eg, 12 hours) staff shifts. If there are 8 essential cases to be done (each lasting 1-2 hours), the ideal solution is to have 2 teams complete the 8 cases, not 8 first case starts. (7) Do 1 case in each operating room daily, with terminal cleaning after each case including UV-C or equivalent. (8) Do not have patients go into a large, pooled phase I postanesthesia care unit because of the risk of contaminating facility at large along with many staff. Instead, have most patients recover in the room where they had surgery as is done routinely in Japan. These 8 programmatic recommendations stand on a substantial body of empirical evidence characterizing the epidemiology of perioperative transmission and infection development made possible by support from the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF).","Dexter, Franklin; Parra, Michelle C; Brown, Jeremiah R; Loftus, Randy W",Anesth Analg,,21

Studies on disease outbreak in the past and recent COVID-19 outbreak have demonstrated increased psychological distress and adverse impacts on mental health and psychological wellbeing of people. However, the impact of COVID-19 on psychological wellbeing of people in Nepal hasn't been studied adequately. So, this paper aims to report the findings from a social media survey on psychological impacts of COVID-19 in Nepal. METHODS: Data were collected through social media from 2082 Nepalese respondents between 23rd April, 2020 and 3rd May, 2020. A total of 2014 respondents who were currently residing in Nepal were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The study suggested that half of the respondents suffered from at least one symptom of psychological distress whereas 32% suffered from two or more symptoms of psychological distress such as restlessness, fearfulness, anxiety and worry and sadness in the past 2 weeks preceding the survey date. The findings further suggested that respondents having lower family income, residing in rented room, and participants from province 2 were more likely to suffer from both single and multiple symptoms of psychological distress. CONCLUSION: The study has shown high prevalence of psychological distress amongst the Nepalese respondents following COVID-19 outbreak. Appropriate mental health and psychosocial support response needs to be instituted to adequately respond to psychological impacts of the epidemic.","Gautam, Kamal; Adhikari, Ramesh P; Gupta, Aman Sen; Shrestha, Rajan Kumar; Koirala, Pitambar; Koirala, Suraj",BMC Psychol,,21

This study estimates the prevalence of COVID-19 among farmers and farmworkers in the United States by coupling county-level data on the number of farm workers relative to the general population with data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. In the 13 month period since the start of the pandemic (from March 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021), the estimated cumulative number of COVID-19 cases (deaths) was 329,031 (6,166) among agricultural producers, 170,137 (2,969) among hired agricultural workers, 202,902 (3,812) among unpaid agricultural workers, and 27,223 (459) among migrant agricultural workers. The cases amount to 9.55%, 9.31%, 9.39%, and 9.01% of all U.S. agricultural producers, hired workers, unpaid workers, and migrant workers, respectively. The COVID-19 incidence rate is significantly higher in counties with more agricultural workers; a 1% increase in the number of hired agricultural workers in a county is associated with a 0.04% increase in the number of COVID-19 cases per person and 0.07% increase in deaths per person. Although estimated new cases among farm workers exhibit similar trends to that of the general population, the correlation between the two is sometimes negative, highlighting the need to monitor this particular population that tends to live in more rural areas. Reduction in labor availability from COVID-19 is estimated to reduce U.S. agricultural output by about $309 million.","Lusk, Jayson L; Chandra, Ranveer",PLoS One,,21

We aimed to assess the safety of the vaccine among healthcare workers.Methods: A self-administered online survey on monitoring adverse reactions post vaccination was conducted among the staff who worked at and were vaccinated in a tertiary hospital in Taizhou, China, from February 24 to 7 March 2021. A total of 1526 subjects responded to the questionnaire when they received an e-mail or an e-poster on WeChat.Results: The incidences of overall adverse reactions after the first and second injections were 15.6% (238/1526) and 14.6% (204/1397), respectively. The most common adverse reaction was localized pain at the injection site, with an incidence of 9.6% and 10.7% after each dose, accounting for 61.8% and 73.0% of adverse reactions, respectively. Fatigue, muscle pain, and headache were the most common systemic adverse reactions.Conclusions: These findings implied that the inactivated CoronaVac vaccine has an acceptable safety profile among healthcare workers due to the low incidence of self-reported adverse reactions. This may boost public confidence in nationwide mass vaccination campaigns.","Zhang, Mei-Xian; Zhang, Tong-Tong; Shi, Gui-Feng; Cheng, Feng-Min; Zheng, Yan-Ming; Tung, Tao-Hsin; Chen, Hai-Xiao",Expert Rev Vaccines,,21

358236,Enhanced thermostability of the Immobilized Thermoalkalophilic Esterase onto Magnetic-Cornstarch Nanoparticle,2021,"Transition metal oxides have been applied to degrade organic dyes found in water bodies via photocatalysis. To do it, however, is essential that the dye molecules adsorb onto the metal oxide surface. Thus, optimizing the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent increases the probability of reaction between oxidation radicals and organic dye molecules and maximizes the effectiveness per gram of photocatalyst. With this in mind, we studied the adsorption behavior of Methylene Blue (MB) and Acid Orange 7 (AO7), two commonly found pollutants, as a function of dilution's pH, WO3 load, and initial dye concentration. We found out that WO3 adsorbs up to 80% of MB at pH=6, and 13% of AO7 at pH=2, although it is unable to adsorb AO7 at the natural pH of the dye dilution. Assuming a pseudo-second order kinetics model for the analysis of the MB adsorption amount, we determined a rate constant k2 = 6 × 10-2(g · mg-1)/min for the adsorption process. We put forward a molecular model for adsorption, driven by concentration gradients and electrostatic interactions. Finally, from a statistical analysis, we determined that pH is the most significant factor for the adsorption of MB and AO7 on WO3, reinforcing the notion that electrostatic interactions are the main mechanism driving the adsorption process. The Box-Behnken design optimization also evinces the key playing role of WO3 load in the adsorption percentage of AO7 and let us establish the optimal load required to maximize adsorption.","Arteaga-Jiménez, A; Trejo-Perez, M G; García-García, A L; González-Jasso, E; Vidales-Hurtado, M A",Environ Technol,,21

This systematic review of the literature was conducted using MEDLINE from December 1, 2019 to April 13, 2020. The analysis of methodological quality used a method dedicated to case series and case reports. Out of 260 articles initially identified, only two studies were finally included in the qualitative analysis. The mean age was relatively low, between 71 and 74 years on average. The symptoms of COVID-19 were as follows: fever, dry cough, dyspnea, asthenia, anorexia, chest tightness, diarrhea, and to a lesser extent myalgia, pharyngitis, nausea, dizziness, headache, abdominal pain and finally vomiting. Lymphopenia was found in the complete blood count. In conclusion, this systematic review of the international literature reveals a lack of data about the semiology of COVID-19 in older adults, especially in the frail oldest-old ones who commonly define the geriatric population. The national survey conducted by the French Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology will help fill this semiological gap.","Sacco, Guillaume; Brière, Olivier; Asfar, Marine; Guérin, Olivier; Berrut, Gilles; Annweiler, Cédric",Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil,,21
364689,Design and synthesis of some imidazole derivatives: Theoretical evaluation of interaction with a coronavirus (HCoV-NL63),2020,"Radioresistance is an important factor affecting the radiotherapy effect of colorectal cancer (CRC). Allicin is a versatile sulfur-containing organic compound extracted from garlic (Allium sativum L.), which has many pharmacological effects. However, the effect of allicin on the sensitivity of CRC radiotherapy has not been confirmed. The present study is to observe the radiosensitivity effects of allicin and to explore its mechanism in CRC radiotherapy. The proliferation inhibition effects of allicin combined with X-ray radiotherapy in HCT116 cells were measured by growth curve of cell and colony formation assays. The cell apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33258 nucleus staining assay. The migration ability of cells was detected by Transwell chamber migration assay. The animal model of CRC was established in BALB/c mice via transplantation of CT26 cell, and the radiosensitization effect of allicin on CRC was detected in vivo. The mRNA expressions of NF-&#954;B, IKKß, and I&#954;B&#945; were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein expressions of NF-&#954;B, p-NF-&#954;B, IKKß, p-IKKß, I&#954;B&#945;, and p-I&#954;B&#945; were detected by western blotting. Our results showed that allicin improves the sensitivity of X-ray radiotherapy in CRC, and its mechanism may be associated with inhibition of NF-&#954;B signaling pathway. These findings suggest that allicin may be used as a potential sensitizer for tumor radiotherapy in the clinic.","Huang, Wen-Liang; Wu, Shu-Fen; Xu, Song-Tao; Ma, Yong-Chao; Wang, Rui; Jin, Shaoju; Zhou, Shan",J. food sci,,21

Morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection is driving recognition of the need for potential research in prevention, effective treatment, and reducing fatalities. In this article, we highlighted discussions and proposals previously reported in our series of articles on the subject of the blood-brain barrier to prevent both neurological and psychiatric manifestations of viral infection. The time for a rapid translational approach to bring point-of-care diagnostics and early prevention/treatment tools to practice is now, and it deserves immediate attention.","Yarlagadda, A.; Preston, S.

366053,The molecular biology of intracellular events during Coronavirus infection cycle,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the relationship between traffic inflow and COVID-19 prevalence in South Korea for formulating prevention policies for novel infections. METHODS: We evaluated traffic inflow and new COVID-19 cases in 8 regions of Korea from January 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021. The toll collection system (TCS) traffic volume for 2019-2020 and traffic inflow trends were analyzed using independent samples t-test and nonlinear regression, respectively. The association between TCS traffic volume and new COVID-19 cases by city was analyzed using correlation analysis. RESULTS: Traffic inflow volume in 2020 decreased 3.7% from 2019. The TCS traffic inflow trend in the 8 provinces decreased during the first COVID-19 wave, gradually increased until the second wave, decreased after the second wave, and showed a sharp decrease in the third wave. There was a positive correlation between the traffic inflow volume and new cases in Busan-Gyeongnam and Jeonbuk, but not in Daegu-Gyeongbuk or Gangwon. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in new COVID-19 cases in the regions was associated with increased traffic inflow volume. Therefore, the Korean government can establish preventive social distancing policies by identifying increases or decreases in traffic volume. These policies will also need to consider the distribution of vaccines in each area.","Lee, Hocheol; Noh, Eunbi; Jeon, Huiwon; Nam, Eun Woo",Int J Infect Dis,,21
368486,Hydration Structure and Dynamics of the Favipiravir Antiviral Drug: A Molecular Modelling Approach,2020,"The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has led to the elaboration of multiple studies to increase knowledge and understanding, hence, having the ability to accomplish an adequate and timely diagnosis and give an optimal treatment according to the patient's condition. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 pose a series of challenges both in understanding and delimiting the disease secondary to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is due to the fact that the main axis of this disease is the endothelial compromise and the production of a ""cytokine storm,"" triggering multiple organ failure and death. Given that a complete understanding of its pathophysiology and clinical behavior has not yet been achieved, we wondered if coinfection with other respiratory viruses modifies its performance and outcomes described so far. A literature search was performed, obtaining 68 articles, of which 25 were analyzed. The analysis showed us that there is a high variety both in the types of associated infections and in the clinical behavior of patients and their outcomes. Therefore, we consider that the search for other infections should be performed exhaustively, especially in those cases that may be susceptible to treatment such as Influenza A, human immunodeficiency virus, or bacterial infections. As well as optimize the analysis of these cases and establish if there are characteristics that allow establishing the possibility of carrying an additional infection to that of SARS-CoV-2 and the implications for the management and prognosis of the patient.","Barrera-López, Pedro; Pérez-Riveros, Erika D; Moreno-Montoya, José; Ballesteros, Silvia Marcela; Valencia, Sergio A; De la Hoz-Valle, José A",J. med. virol,,21
371402,Editorial overview: Virus reverse genetics approaches for the development of preventive and therapeutic vaccines,2020,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-Cov-2 virus pandemic causes serious emotional consequences. It has occurred widespread medical courses suspension, and graduations were anticipated. Field hospitals, set up to treat patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, were the main workplaces of newly graduated doctors. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of medical interns and newly graduated doctors. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study performed using a digital platform. Links to forms were sent in two moments: moment 1 (M1), at the beginning of the pandemic, in the first half of April/2020 and moment 2 (M2), after six months of pandemic, in the second half of September/2020. All students from the medical internship and all doctors graduated since 2018 from the three medical schools in Sergipe-NE-Brazil were invited. RESULTS: 335 forms were answered in April and 148 in September. In M1 88.9% considered themselves exposed to excess of information about COVID-19, which was associated with anxiety symptoms (p = 0.04). Long family physical distance was also associated with these symptoms, as increased appetite (p = 0.01), feeling shortness of breath (p = 0.003) and sweating (p = 0.007). Fear of acquire COVID-19 was reported as intense by almost half of participants, and of transmitting by 85.7% in M1. In M2 41.2% reported the death of friends or relatives. Psychiatric illness was described by 38.5% and psychotropic drugs use by 30.1% in M1, especially those who lived alone (p = 0.03) and the single ones (p = 0.01). Alcohol intake was reported by 54.3%, and among doctors graduated in 2020 it increased from 50% in M1 to 85% in M2 (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The pandemic had a negative impact on the mental health of medical students and newly graduated doctors. Exposure to excessive COVID-19 information and family physical distance were associated to anxiety symptoms. Among doctors graduated in 2020, alcohol intake increased during pandemic evolution.","Ferreira, Lis Campos; Amorim, Rívia Siqueira; Melo Campos, Fellipe Matos; Cipolotti, Rosana",PLoS One,,21
372785,Cell-Based Biosensor to Visualize Nitric Oxide Release from Living Cells for Toxicity Assessment,2021,"AIM: The aim of this study was the evaluation of the combination of Pycnogenol® (150 mg/day) and Centella asiatica (Centellicum® 3 x 225 mg/day) (PY-CE) for 8 months in subjects with sequelae of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). Recently, post-COVID-19 lung disease is emerging with large numbers of patients left with chronic lung conditions. Considering the antifibrotic activity of the combination PY-CE, we also tested this supplementary management in post-COVID-19 lung patients. RESULTS: 19 subjects with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) were included in the study. High Resolution CT scans at inclusion confirmed the presence of lung fibrosis: 10 patients were treated with the Pycnogenol® Centellicum® combination and 9 subjects with standard management (SM) served as controls. Oxidative stress that was very high in all subjects at inclusion, decreased significantly in the supplement group (p<0.05). The Karnofsky performance scale index significantly improved in the supplement group in comparison with controls (p<0.05). The symptoms (fatigue, muscular pain, dyspnea) were significantly lower after 8 months in supplemented patients (p<0.05) as compared with controls. At the end of the study, the small cystic lesions (honeycombing) and traction bronchiectasis were stable or in partial regression in 4 subjects in the supplemented group (vs none in the control group) with a significant improvement in tissue edema in the supplemented subjects. On ultrasound lung scans the white (more echogenic) fibrotic component at inclusion was 18.5±2.2% in the images in controls vs 19.4±2.7% in the supplement group. At the end of the study, there was no improvement in controls (18.9±2.5%) vs a significant improvement in supplemented subjects (16.2±2.1%; p<0.05). In addition, 18 subjects with post-COVID-19 lung disease were included in the study; 10 patients were treated with the Pycnogenol® Centellicum® combination and evaluated after 4 weeks; 8 patients served as controls. Preliminary results show that symptoms associated with post-COVID-19 lung disease after 4 weeks were significantly improved with the supplement combination (p<0.05). Oxidative stress and the Karnofsky performance scale index scale were significantly improved in the supplements group as compared with controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: According to these observations, Pycnogenol® controls and decreases edema in several conditions and Centellicum® - modulating the apposition of collagen - modulates the development of irregular cicatrization, keloidal scarring and fibrosis. More time is needed to evaluate this effect in a larger number of post-COVID-19 patients with lung disease. This disease has affected millions of subjects worldwide, leaving severe consequences. Pycnogenol® and Centellicum® may improve the residual clinical picture in post-COVID-19 lung disease (PCL) patients and may reduce the number of subjects evolving into lung fibrosis. The evolution from edema to fibrosis seems to be slower or attenuated with this supplement combination both in Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and in PCL patients.","Cesarone, Maria R; Hu, Shu; Belcaro, Gianni; Cornelli, Umberto; Feragalli, Beatrice; Corsi, Marcello; Bombardelli, Ezio; Cotellese, Roberto; Hosoi, Morio; Rosenkvist, Lars",Minerva med,,21

Although megakaryocytes are not mentioned as a characteristic histologic finding associated to pulmonary injury, a few studies reveal that their number is increased in diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). In this autopsy study, we have observed a relevant number of pulmonary megakaryocytes in COVID-19 patients dying with acute lung injury (7.61 ± 5.59 megakaryocytes per 25 high-power fields vs. 1.14 ± 0.86 for the control group, p < 0.05). We analyzed samples of 18 patients, most of whom died after prolonged disease and use of mechanical ventilation. Most patients showed advanced DAD and abnormal coagulation parameters with high levels of fibrinogen, D-dimers, and variable thrombocytopenia. For comparison, pulmonary samples from a group of 14 non-COVID-19 patients dying with DAD were reviewed. They showed similar pulmonary histopathologic findings and an increase in the number of megakaryocytes (4 ± 4.17 vs. 1.14 ± 0.86 for the control group, p < 0.05). Megakaryocyte count in the COVID-19 group was greater but did not reach statistical significance (7.61 ± 5.59 vs. 4 ± 4.17, p = 0.063). Regardless of the cause, pulmonary megakaryocytes are increased in patients with DAD. Their high number seen in COVID-19 patients suggests a relation with the thrombotic events so often seen these patients. Since the lung is considered an active site of megakaryopoiesis, a prothrombotic status leading to platelet activation, aggregation and consumption may trigger a compensatory pulmonary response.","Valdivia-Mazeyra, Mariel F; Salas, Clara; Nieves-Alonso, Jesús M; Martín-Fragueiro, Luz; Bárcena, Carmen; Muñoz-Hernández, Patricia; Villar-Zarra, Karen; Martín-López, Javier; Ramasco-Rueda, Fernando; Fraga, Javier; Jiménez-Heffernan, José A",Virchows arch,,21

Currently, there is no specific treatment for JEV. A vaccine would be an effective measure for reducing morbidity and mortality. Although the live attenuated vaccine SA14-14-2 has been approved in some countries, it is still necessary to develop safer, more effective, and less costly vaccines. In this study, a DNA vaccine candidate, pV-SA14ME, expressing the prM/E proteins of SA14-14-2 was inoculated into BALB/c mice via intramuscular electroporation, and the immunogenicity and degree of protection were evaluated. We found that administration of 50 µg pV-SA14ME via electroporation via three immunizations could induce persistent humoral and cellular immune responses and effectively protect mice against lethal JEV challenge.

398959,Molecular mechanisms and pharmacological interventions in the replication cycle of human coronaviruses,2020,"All four of the adenosine receptor (AR) subtypes mediate pain and have been targeted by pharmacologists to generate new therapeutics for chronic pain. The vanilloid phytochemicals, which include curcumin, capsaicin, and gingerol, have been shown to alleviate pain. However, there is little to no literature on the interaction of vanilloid phytochemicals with ARs. In this study, photochemical methods were used to generate a novel isomer of curcumin (cis-trans curcumin or CTCUR), and the interactions of both curcumin and CTCUR with the two Gs-linked AR subtypes were studied. Competitive binding assays, docking analysis, and confocal fluorescence microscopy were performed to measure binding affinity; cell survival assays were used to measure toxicity; and cAMP assays were performed to measure receptor activation. Competitive binding results indicated that CTCUR binds to both AR A2A and AR A2B with Ki values of 5 µM and 7 µM, respectively, which is consistent with our docking results. Fluorescence microscopy data also shows binding for A2B and A2A. Cell survival results show that CTCUR and CUR are nontoxic at the tested concentrations in these cell lines. Overall, our results suggest that vanilloid phytochemicals may be slightly modified to increase interaction with Gs-ARs, and thereby can be further explored to provide a novel class of non-opioid antinociceptives.","Hamilton, Luke J; Walker, Michaela; Pattabiraman, Mahesh; Zhong, Haizhen A; Luedtke, Brandon; Chandra, Surabhi",Pharmacol Res,,21

399572,A crystallography-based investigation of weak interactions for drug design against COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE: The trajectory of mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for clinical decisions, yet the focus so far has been on admission characteristics without consideration of the dynamic course of the disease in the context of applied therapeutic interventions. METHODS: We included adult patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 48 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission with complete clinical data until ICU death or discharge. We examined the importance of factors associated with disease progression over the first week, implementation and responsiveness to interventions used in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ICU outcome. We used machine learning (ML) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to characterise the evolution of clinical parameters and our ICU data visualisation tool is available as a web-based widget ( https://www.CovidUK.ICU ). RESULTS: Data for 633 adults with COVID-19 who underwent IMV between 01 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 were analysed. Overall mortality was 43.3% and highest with non-resolution of hypoxaemia [60.4% vs17.6%; P < 0.001; median PaO2/FiO2 on the day of death was 12.3(8.9-18.4) kPa] and non-response to proning (69.5% vs.31.1%; P < 0.001). Two ML models using weeklong data demonstrated an increased predictive accuracy for mortality compared to admission data (74.5% and 76.3% vs 60%, respectively). XAI models highlighted the increasing importance, over the first week, of PaO2/FiO2 in predicting mortality. Prone positioning improved oxygenation only in 45% of patients. A higher peak pressure (OR 1.42[1.06-1.91]; P < 0.05), raised respiratory component (OR 1.71[ 1.17-2.5]; P < 0.01) and cardiovascular component (OR 1.36 [1.04-1.75]; P < 0.05) of the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and raised lactate (OR 1.33 [0.99-1.79]; P = 0.057) immediately prior to application of prone positioning were associated with lack of oxygenation response. Prone positioning was not applied to 76% of patients with moderate hypoxemia and 45% of those with severe hypoxemia and patients who died without receiving proning interventions had more missed opportunities for prone intervention [7 (3-15.5) versus 2 (0-6); P < 0.001]. Despite the severity of gas exchange deficit, most patients received lung-protective ventilation with tidal volumes less than 8 mL/kg and plateau pressures less than 30cmH2O. This was despite systematic errors in measurement of height and derived ideal body weight. CONCLUSIONS: Refractory hypoxaemia remains a major association with mortality, yet evidence based ARDS interventions, in particular prone positioning, were not implemented and had delayed application with an associated reduced responsiveness. Real-time service evaluation techniques offer opportunities to assess the delivery of care and improve protocolised implementation of evidence-based ARDS interventions, which might be associated with improvements in survival.","Patel, Brijesh V; Haar, Shlomi; Handslip, Rhodri; Auepanwiriyakul, Chaiyawan; Lee, Teresa Mei-Ling; Patel, Sunil; Harston, J Alex; Hosking-Jervis, Feargus; Kelly, Donna; Sanderson, Barnaby; Borgatta, Barbara; Tatham, Kate; Welters, Ingeborg; Camporota, Luigi; Gordon, Anthony C; Komorowski, Matthieu; Antcliffe, David; Prowle, John R; Puthucheary, Zudin; Faisal, Aldo A",Intensive Care Med,,21

404228,Strength of immune selection in tumors varies with sex and age,2020,"BACKGROUND: Understanding how HLA polymorphisms may affect both susceptibility, course and severity of Covid-19 infection could help both at the clinical level to identify individuals at higher risk from the disease and at the epidemiological one to explain the differences in the epidemic trend among countries or even within a specific country. Covid-19 disease in Italy showed a peculiar geographical distribution from the northern most affected regions to the southern ones only slightly touched. METHODS: In this study we analysed the regional frequencies for the most common Italian haplotypes from the Italian Bone Marrow Donor Registry (HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 at four-digit level). Then we performed Pearson correlation analyses among regional haplotypes estimated frequency in the population and Covid-19 incidence and mortality. RESULTS: In this study we found that the two most frequent HLA haplotypes in the Italian population, HLA-A*:01:01g-B*08:01 g-C*07:01g-DRB1*03:01g and HLA-A*02.01g-B*18.01g-C*07.01g-DRB1*11.04g, had a regional distribution overlapping that of Covid-19 and showed respectively a positive (suggestive of susceptibility) and negative (suggestive of protection) significant correlation with both Covid-19 incidence and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, in order to define such HLA haplotypes as a factor effectively associated to the disease susceptibility, the creation of national networks that can collect patients' samples from all regions for HLA typing should be highly encouraged.","Pisanti, Simona; Deelen, Joris; Gallina, Anna Maria; Caputo, Mariella; Citro, Marianna; Abate, Mario; Sacchi, Nicoletta; Vecchione, Carmine; Martinelli, Rosanna",J Transl Med,,21

409852,"Two distant helicases in one mycovirus: evidence of horizontal gene transfer between mycoviruses, coronaviruses and other nidoviruses",2021,"The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is a key enzyme in viral replication and a promising target for the development of antiviral therapeutics. The understanding of this protein is based on a number of observations derived from earlier x-ray structures, which mostly consider substrates or ligands as the main reason behind modulation of the active site. This lead to the concept of substrate-induced subsite cooperativity as an initial attempt to explain the dual binding specificity of this enzyme in recognizing the cleavage sequences at its N- and C-termini, which are important processing steps in obtaining the mature protease. The presented hypothesis proposes that structural heterogeneity is a property of the enzyme, independent of the presence of a substrate or ligand. Indeed, the analysis of Mpro structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 reveals a conformational diversity for the catalytically competent state in ligand-free structures. Variation in the binding site appears to result from flexibility at residues lining the S1 subpocket and segments incorporating methionine 49 and glutamine 189. The structural evidence introduces ""structure-based recognition"" as a new paradigm in substrate proteolysis by Mpro. In this concept, the binding space in subpockets of the enzyme varies in a non-cooperative manner, causing distinct conformations, which recognize and process different cleavage sites, as the N- and C-termini. Insights into the recognition basis of the protease provide explanation to the ordered processing of cleavage sites. The hypothesis expands the conformational space of the enzyme and consequently opportunities for drug development and repurposing efforts.","Behnam, Mira A M",Biochimie,,21

We conducted the present research with the aim of studying gender differences of university students in the perceived risk of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in psychological, nutritional, oral health, and physical activity habits. To reach the study's aim, 300 volunteer university students completed an online questionnaire which analyzed variables of perceived risk of the COVID-19 pandemic, psychological profiles, and nutritional, oral health, and physical activity habits. Results showed that females presented a higher perception of danger to the COVID-19 virus than males but showed no differences in how the pandemic has affected personal lives. Females showed higher values of anxiety, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience, while males presented higher values of extraversion. Nutritionally, males presented greater consumption of soft drinks, meat, and pasta or rice, and lower buccal hygiene. Yet, no differences were found regarding physical activity patterns.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted training programs designed to accomplish this goal, including the Humanitarian Response Intensive Course, which includes a 3-d immersive simulation to prepare humanitarian workers for future field work. To provide program continuity, the 3-d simulation was quickly adapted to a virtual format using a combination of video conferencing, short messaging service, and cloud-based file storage software. Participants were geographically dispersed and participated virtually. Learning objectives were preserved, while some components not amenable to a virtual format were removed.A virtual humanitarian training simulation is a feasible, acceptable, and affordable alternative to an in-person simulation. Participants were engaged and experienced minimal technological disruptions. The majority of students believed the format met or exceeded expectations. However, feedback also emphasized the importance of providing sufficient time for team collaboration and deliverable preparation in the simulation schedule. The virtual format was more affordable than the traditional in-person simulation, and diverse expert faculty who could not have attended in-person were able to participate. This format could be used to overcome other barriers to in-person simulation training, including geographic, financial, time, or security.","Kivlehan, Sean M; Tenney, Kathryne; Plasmati, Sam; Bollettino, Vincenzo; Farineau, Katie; Nilles, Eric J; Gottlieb, Greg; Kayden, Stephanie R",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,21

The pandemic has created challenges for acute stroke care. Rapid assessment and time-sensitive interventions required for optimum outcomes in acute stroke care have been complicated by COVID-19 due to the need for disease transmission preventive measures. The purpose of this article is to explore the putative mechanisms of ischemic stroke in COVID-19 and the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients who develop ischemic stroke.

Methods: : This study provides early outcomes of health policy measures, social- and health system capacity as well as economic challenges in COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. This paper is based available documents and reports of different ministries and social, health and economic authorities collected online. This was complemented by other relevant pandemic data from Finland. Results: : The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the Finnish society has been unpredictable although it has not been as extensive and massive than in many other countries. As the situation evolved the Government took strict measures to stop the spread of the virus (e.g. Emergency Powers Act). Available information shows that the economic consequences will be drastic also in Finland, albeit perhaps less dramatic than in large industrial economies. Conclusions: : Finland has transferred gradually to a ""hybrid strategy"", referring to a move from extensive restrictive measures to enhanced management of the epidemic. However, health system must be prepared for prospective setback. It is possible, that COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development of digital health services and telemedicine in Finnish healthcare system.","Tiirinki, Hanna; Tynkkynen, Liina-Kaisa; Sovala, Markus; Atkins, Salla; Koivusalo, Meri; Rautiainen, Pauli; Jormanainen, Vesa; Keskimäki, Ilmo",Health Policy Technol,,21

METHODS: According to whether or not their glucose metabolism was impaired, COVID-19 patients were subdivided into 2 groups: 1) with DM and IFG, 2) control group. Their demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms, laboratory results, and final clinical results were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: 28 patients (16.3%) died during hospitalization, including 21 (29.2%) in group 1 and 7 (7.0%) in group 2 (P < 0.001). Fbg levels in groups 1 and 2 were higher than the normal range, at 5.6 g/L (IQR 4.5-7.2 g/L) and 5.0 g/L (IQR 4.0-6.1 g/L), respectively (P = 0.009). Serum ferritin levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), triglycerides (TG) were significantly increased in group 1 compared to those in the control. TG levels were 1.3 mmol/L in the control, while that in group 1 was 1.8 mmol/L.

CONCLUSIONS: Fbg in all COVID-19 patients is related to serum ferritin and CRP involved in inflammation. Furthermore, in COVID-19 patients with insulin resistance, Fbg is linearly positively correlated with TG. This suggests that regulation of TG, insulin resistance, and inflammation may reduce hypercoagulability in COVID-19 patients, especially those with insulin resistance.","Wang, Zhenzhou; Du, Zhe; Zhao, Xiujuan; Guo, Fuzheng; Wang, Tianbing; Zhu, Fengxue",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,,21

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 concentrations in solids normalized by concentrations of PMMoV RNA in solids can be used to compare incidence of laboratory confirmed new COVID-19 cases across POTWs. Using data collected at seven POTWs along the United States West Coast, Midwest, and East Coast serving ∼3% of the U.S. population (9 million people), we show that a 1 log change in N gene/PMMoV is associated with a 0.24 (range 0.19 to 0.29) log10 change in incidence of laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Scaling of N1 and N2 by PMMoV is consistent, conceptually, with a mass balance model relating SARS-CoV-2 RNA to the number of infected individuals shedding virus in their stool. This information should support the application of wastewater-based epidemiology to inform the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and potentially future viral pandemics. ©","Wolfe, M.

Due to the disease severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, it is necessary to provide an accurate and automated triage system to classify and isolate the suspected cases. Different triage methods for COVID-19 patients have been proposed as disease symptoms vary by country. Still, several problems with triage systems remain unresolved, most notably overcrowding in EDs, lengthy waiting times and difficulty adjusting static triage systems when the nature and symptoms of a disease changes. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of general ED triage systems as well as COVID-19 triage systems. We identified important parameters that we recommend considering when designing an e-Triage (electronic triage) system for EDs, namely waiting time, simplicity, reliability, validity, scalability, and adaptability. Moreover, the study proposes a scoring-based e-Triage system for COVID-19 along with several recommended solutions to enhance the overall outcome of e-Triage systems during the outbreak. The recommended solutions aim to reduce overcrowding and overheads in EDs by remotely assessing patients' conditions and identifying their severity levels.","Alhaidari, Fahd; Almuhaideb, Abdullah; Alsunaidi, Shikah; Ibrahim, Nehad; Aslam, Nida; Khan, Irfan Ullah; Shaikh, Fatema; Alshahrani, Mohammed; Alharthi, Hajar; Alsenbel, Yasmine; Alalharith, Dima",Sensors (Basel),,21

Increased mass testing and surveillance are crucial for controlling the disease spread, obtaining better pandemic statistics, and developing realistic epidemiological models. Despite the advantages of nucleic acid- and antigen-based tests such as accuracy, specificity, and non-invasive approaches of sample collection, they can only detect active infections. Antibodies (immunoglobulins) are produced by the host immune system within a few days after infection and persist in the blood for at least several weeks after infection resolution. Antibody-based tests have provided a substitute and effective method of ultra-rapid detection for multiple contagious disease outbreaks in the past, including viral diseases such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Thus, although not highly suitable for early diagnosis, antibody-based methods can be utilized to detect past infections hidden in the population, including asymptomatic ones. In an active community spread scenario of a disease that can provide a bigger window for mass detections and a practical approach for continuous surveillance. These factors encouraged researchers to investigate means of improving antibody-based rapid tests and employ them as reliable, reproducible, sensitive, specific, and economic tools for COVID-19 mass testing and surveillance. The development and integration of such immunoglobulin-based tests can transform the pandemic diagnosis by moving the same out of the clinics and laboratories into community testing sites and homes. This review discusses the principle, technology, and strategies being used in antibody-based testing at present. It also underlines the immense prospect of immunoglobulin-based testing and the efficacy of repeated planned deployment in pandemic management and post-pandemic sustainable screenings globally.","Augustine, Robin; Das, Suvarthi; Hasan, Anwarul; S, Abhilash; Abdul Salam, Shaheen; Augustine, Priya; Dalvi, Yogesh Bharat; Varghese, Ruby; Primavera, Rosita; Yassine, Hadi Mohamad; Thakor, Avnesh S; Kevadiya, Bhavesh D",,,21

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were (1) to determine the pharmacokinetics of imipenem and (2) to assess the probability of target attainment (PTA) for imipenem in critically ill patients with life-threatening severe infections during support with ECMO. METHODS: The pharmacokinetic studies were carried out following administration of 0.5 g of imipenem every 6 h on the 4th dose of drug administration in 10 patients and a Monte Carlo simulation was performed to determine the PTA of achieving 40% exposure time during which the plasma drug concentrations remained above minimum inhibitory concentration (T > MIC) and 80% T > MIC. RESULTS: The median values of volume of distribution and total clearance (CL) of imipenem in these patients were 13.98 L and 9.78 L/h, respectively. A high PTA (&#8805; 90%) for a target of 80% with a MIC of 4 µg/mL in patients with CLCR 60-120 mL/min and flow rate of ECMO circuit 3-5.5 L/min was observed when imipenem was administered by a 4-h infusion of 1 g every 6 h. CONCLUSIONS: A high dosage regimen such as 1 g every 6 h of imipenem may be required to achieve pharmacodynamic targets against less susceptible pathogens in this patient population. CLINICALTRIAL.

472761,Review of antiviral peptides for use against zoonotic and selected non-zoonotic viruses,2021,"Background and Aims: Publication of a scientific article in a reputed journal is an uphill task that demands a significant amount of time and effort from the author and editorial team. It is a matter of great enthusiasm for all prospective researchers to know whether this daily evolving publication load of articles during this pandemic had changed the journal's inherent peer review or publication process. We aimed to compare the peer review speed of anesthesiology journal articles published during pandemic (2020) to the previous year and to analyze various factors affecting peer review speed. Material and Methods: Overall, 16 anesthesiology journals indexed in MEDLINE database were retrospectively analyzed. A set of 24 articles published in 2019 of the included journals were selected from each journal for control and a set of 12 articles published between January to September 2020 was selected for comparison. Time taken for acceptance and publication from the time of submission was noted. Peer review timing was calculated and its relationship with h-index, continent of journal origin and article processing charges were evaluated. Results: The median peer review time in 2019 and 2020 were 116 (108-125) days and 79 (65-105.5) days, respectively. There was a 31.8% decrease (P = 0.0021) in peer review time of all articles in 2020 compared to 2019. The median peer review timings of COVID-19 articles were 35 (22-42.5) days. A 55.6% decrease was noted in peer review time of COVID-19 articles compared to non-COVID-19 articles in 2020. There was a significant correlation between peer review time and h-index (r = 0.558, P = 0.024). There was no significant difference in peer review timing of journals with or without article processing charge (P = 0.75) and between journals from different continents (P = 0.56). Conclusion: Anesthesiology journals managed to curtail their turnaround time for peer review during the pandemic compared to previous year. Journal with higher h-index had longer peer review time. The option for articles processing charge and continent of publishing journal had no impact on peer review speed. © 2021 Journal of Anaesthesiology Clinical Pharmacology Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","Behera, B.

474837,Graphical abstract TOC,2020,"Of the seven coronaviruses associated with disease in humans, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cause considerable mortality but also share significant sequence homology, and potentially antigenic epitopes capable of inducing an immune response. The degree of similarity is such that perhaps prior exposure to one virus could confer partial immunity to another. Indeed, data suggests a considerable amount of cross-reactivity and recognition by the hosts immune response between different coronavirus infections. While the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak rapidly overwhelmed medical facilities of particularly Europe and North America, accounting for 78% of global deaths, only 8% of deaths have occurred in Asia where the outbreak originated. Interestingly, Asia and the Middle East have previously experienced multiple rounds of coronavirus infections, perhaps suggesting buildup of acquired immunity to the causative SARS-CoV-2 that underlies COVID-19. This article hypothesizes that a causative factor underlying such low morbidity in these regions is perhaps (at least in part) due to acquired immunity from multiple rounds of coronavirus infections and discusses the mechanisms and recent evidence to support such assertions. Further investigations of such phenomenon would allow us to examine strategies to confer protective immunity, perhaps aiding vaccine development.","Yaqinuddin, Ahmed",Med Hypotheses,,21
478886,A Tale of Two Viruses: The Distinct Spike Glycoproteins of Feline Coronaviruses,2020,"In this paper, we study the trending behaviour of COVID-19 data at country level, and draw attention to some existing econometric tools which are potentially helpful to understand the trend better in future studies. In our empirical study, we find that European countries overall flatten the curves more effectively compared to the other regions, while Asia&Oceania also achieve some success, but the situations are not as optimistic elsewhere. Africa and America are still facing serious challenges in terms of managing the spread of the virus, and reducing the death rate, although in Africa the virus spreads slower and has a lower death rate than the other regions. By comparing the performances of different countries, our results incidentally agree with Gu et al. (2020), though different approaches and models are considered. For example, both works agree that countries such as USA, UK and Italy perform relatively poorly; on the other hand, Australia, China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore perform relatively better.","Dong, Chaohua; Gao, Jiti; Linton, Oliver; Peng, Bin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11060v2.pdf,21
479179,Comparative host-pathogen protein-protein interaction analysis of recent coronavirus outbreaks and important host targets identification,2020,"As space exploration efforts shift to deep space missions, new challenges emerge regarding astronaut communication and task completion. While the round trip propagation delay for lunar communications is 2.6 seconds, the time delay increases to nearly 22 minutes for Mars missions. This creates a need for astronaut independence from earth-based assistance, and places greater significance upon the limited communications that are able to be delivered. To address this issue, we prototyped an augmented reality user interface for the new xEMU spacesuit, intended for use on planetary surface missions. This user interface assists with functions that would usually be completed by flight controllers in Mission Control, or are currently completed in manners that are unnecessarily difficult. We accomplish this through features such as AR model-based task instruction, sampling task assistance, note taking, and telemetry monitoring and display.","Radway, Sarah; Luo, Anthony; Elvezio, Carmine; Cha, Jenny; Kolak, Sophia; Zulu, Elijah; Adib, Sad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14535v1.pdf,21

481079,Antiviral potential of natural products from marine microbes,2020,"BACKGROUND: In contrast to neighboring countries, German and Swiss authorities refrained from general curfews during the first pandemic wave in spring 2020, calling for solidarity and personal responsibility instead. Using a qualitative methodology, this study aims to explore why people in Germany and Switzerland were motivated to comply with policy measures during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and what factors hindered or limited their motivation. While quantitative surveys can measure the level of compliance, or broadly ask what motives people had for compliance, we here strive to explain why and how these motives lead to compliance. METHODS: This publication has been made possible by the joint work of the members of the ""Solidarity in times of pandemics"" (SolPan) research commons. Seventy-seven semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with members of the general public in Germany (n = 46) and the German-speaking part of Switzerland (n = 31) in April 2020. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed following a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Three themes were identified that summarize factors contributing to compliant or noncompliant behavior. (1) Social cohesion was, on the one hand, an important motivator for compliance, but at the same time related to conflicting needs, illustrating the limits of compliance. (2) Consequences were considered on both the individual level (eg, consequences of individual infection) and societal level (eg, the societal and economic consequences of restrictions). (3) While for some participants following the rules was perceived as a matter of principle, others stressed the importance of making their own risk assessment, which was often associated with with a need for evidence on the effectiveness and reasons behind measures. CONCLUSION: A variety of motives contribute to COVID-19 related compliance. Authorities should seek to address these multi-faceted aspects to support motivation for compliance in a large proportion of the population.","Zimmermann, Bettina M; Fiske, Amelia; McLennan, Stuart; Sierawska, Anna; Hangel, Nora; Buyx, Alena",Int. j. health policy manag,,21

This study seeks to identify factors, including characteristics of patients and referring clinicians, that influence LDCT screening completion following participation in SDM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study consisted of n = 171 patients eligible for LDCT screening and who participated in SDM between 2016 and 2017 in one of two sites in Prisma Health, an academic health care delivery system in South Carolina. Patient characteristics included age, sex, race, body mass index, marital status, insurance, smoking status and history, family history of lung cancer, SDM site, and distance to screening site. Characteristics of referred clinicians included age, sex, race, specialty, years of practice, education, and residency. Descriptive statistics and multivariable generalized linear mixed models were used to compare effects of patient and referring clinician characteristics on LDCT completion. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients (89%) completed LDCT screening after participation in SDM. SDM site (p = 0.02), longer distances to the screening site (p = 0.03), referrals from internal medicine clinicians (p = 0.03), and referrals from younger clinicians (p = 0.01) and from those with less years of experience (p = 0.02) were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of screening completion. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors significantly associated with screening completion were identified. This information can assist with development of interventions to improve communication and decision-making between patients, clinicians, and SDM health professionals, and inform design of targeted decision aids embedded into SDM procedures.","Rennert, Lior; Zhang, Lu; Lumsden, Brandon; Harwood, Katon; Tyler, Lauren; Ashby, Morgan; Hanna, Jeffrey W; Gimbel, Ronald W",Cancer Treat Res Commun,,21
494433,"Author Correction: Infectivity, susceptibility, and risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission under intensive contact tracing in Hunan, China",2021,"RESEARCH PURPOSE: The sinus node (SN) is the heart's primary pacemaker. Key ion channels (mainly the funny channel, HCN4) and Ca2+-handling proteins in the SN are responsible for its function. Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression through inhibition or activation and microRNAs (miRs) do this through inhibition. There is high expression of macrophages and mast cells within the SN connective tissue. 'Novel'/unexplored TFs and miRs in the regulation of ion channels and immune cells in the SN are not well understood. Using RNAseq and bioinformatics, the expression profile and predicted interaction of key TFs and cell markers with key miRs in the adult human SN vs. right atrial tissue (RA) were determined. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: 68 and 60 TFs significantly more or less expressed in the SN vs. RA respectively. Among those more expressed were ISL1 and TBX3 (involved in embryonic development of the SN) and 'novel' RUNX1-2, CEBPA, GLI1-2 and SOX2. These TFs were predicted to regulate HCN4 expression in the SN. Markers for different cells: fibroblasts (COL1A1), fat (FABP4), macrophages (CSF1R and CD209), natural killer (GZMA) and mast (TPSAB1) were significantly more expressed in the SN vs. RA. Interestingly, RUNX1-3, CEBPA and GLI1 also regulate expression of these cells. MiR-486-3p inhibits HCN4 and markers involved in immune response. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, RUNX1-2, CSF1R, TPSAB1, COL1A1 and HCN4 are highly expressed in the SN but not miR-486-3p. Their complex interactions can be used to treat SN dysfunction such as bradycardia. Interestingly, another research group recently reported miR-486-3p is upregulated in blood samples from severe COVID-19 patients who suffer from bradycardia.","Aminu, Abimbola J; Petkova, Maria; Atkinson, Andrew J; Yanni, Joseph; Morris, Alex D; Simms, Robert T; Chen, Weixuan; Yin, Zeyuan; Kuniewicz, Marcin; Holda, Mateusz K; Kuzmin, Vladislav S; Perde, Filip; Molenaar, Peter; Dobrzynski, Halina",Prog. biophys. mol. biol,,21

503611,The Molecular Basis of Host Selection in a Crucifer-Specialized Moth,2020,"Type I and Type II pneumocytes are two forms of epithelial cells found lining the alveoli in the lungs. Type II pneumocytes exclusively secrete 'pulmonary surfactants', a lipo-protein complex made up of 90% lipids (mainly phospholipids) and 10% surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D). Respiratory diseases like influenza, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are reported to preferentially attack type II pneumocytes of the lungs. After viral invasion, consequent viral propagation and destruction of type II pneumocytes causes altered surfactant production, resulting in dyspnea and Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. Exogenous animal-derived or synthetic pulmonary surfactant therapy has already shown immense success in the treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and has the potential to contribute efficiently to repairing damaged alveoli and preventing SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure. Furthermore, the early detection of surfactant collectins (SP-A and SP-D) in the circulatory system can be a significant clinical marker for disease prognosis in the near future.","Ghati, Amit; Dam, Paulami; Tasdemir, Didar; Kati, Ahmet; Sellami, Hanen; Sezgin, Gulten Can; Ildiz, Nilay; Franco, Octavio L; Mandal, Amit Kumar; Ocsoy, Ismail",Curr Opin Colloid Interface Sci,,21

Systemic inflammation is also a main characteristic of periodontitis. Therefore, we investigated the association of periodontitis with COVID-19 complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was performed using the national electronic health records of the State of Qatar between February and July 2020. Cases were defined as patients who suffered COVID-19 complications (death, ICU admissions or assisted ventilation), and controls were COVID-19 patients discharged without major complications. Periodontal conditions were assessed using dental radiographs from the same database. Associations between periodontitis and COVID 19 complications were analysed using logistic regression models adjusted for demographic, medical and behaviour factors. RESULTS: In total, 568 patients were included. After adjusting for potential confounders, periodontitis was associated with COVID-19 complication including death (OR = 8.81, 95% CI 1.00-77.7), ICU admission (OR = 3.54, 95% CI 1.39-9.05) and need for assisted ventilation (OR = 4.57, 95% CI 1.19-17.4). Similarly, blood levels of white blood cells, D-dimer and C Reactive Protein were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with periodontitis.

This study aims to explore the association between risk perception (perceived severity and perceived probability), perceived efficacy (individual's efficacy and government's efficacy), trust in authorities, and intention to implement influenza protective behaviors. METHODS: The data (Nâ¯=â¯1,372) used in this paper comes from the 2013 Taiwan Social Change Survey dataset. Six intentions of protective behaviors (getting vaccinated, wearing a mask, washing hands, avoiding going to public settings, sanitizing home, and eating nutritional supplements) were investigated. Tobit and ordered logistic regressions were used to conduct data analysis. RESULTS: Respondents were most inclined to washing hands, followed by wearing a mask, avoiding going to public settings, getting vaccine, sanitizing their homes, and eating nutritional supplements. Perceived severity and individual's efficacy were positively correlated with all 6 behavioral intentions. Trust in authorities has positive effect on all the protective behaviors except sanitizing home.

Government's efficacy was only positively correlated with eating nutritional supplements. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived severity and perceived response efficacy towards flu, as well as trust in authorities were relatively important factors in motivating people's intention to adopt influenza protective behaviors.","Gong, Zepeng; Veuthey, Justin; Han, Ziqiang",Am J Infect Control,,21

For 6 months, the mifepristone Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) was temporarily blocked, allowing for the remote provision of medication abortion. Remote medication abortion may become a dominant model of care in the future, either through the formal health system or through self-sourced, self-managed abortion. Clinics already face pressure from falling abortion rates and excessive regulation and with a transition to remote abortion, may not be able to sustain services. Although remote medication abortion improves access for many, those who need or want in-clinic care such as people later in pregnancy, people for whom abortion at home is not safe or feasible, or people who are not eligible for medication abortion, will need comprehensive support to access safe and appropriate care. To understand how we may adapt to remote abortion without leaving people behind, we can look outside of the U.S. to become familiar with emerging and alternative models of abortion care.","Mark, Alice; Foster, Angel M; Perritt, Jamila",Contraception,,21
516511,Modeling mitigation of influenza epidemics by baloxavir,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has played a vital role in the diagnosis of COVID-19, but the rates of false negatives is not ideal in dealing with this highly infectious virus. It is thus necessary to systematically evaluate the clinical performance of the single-, dual-, triple-target detection kits to guide the clinical diagnosis of this disease. METHODS: A series of reference materials calibrated by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and 57 clinical samples were used to evaluate the clinical performance of six single-, dual-, triple-target SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kits based on RT-qPCR. RESULTS: The dual-target kits, kit B and kit C had the highest and the lowest detection sensitivity, which was 125 copies/mL and 4000 copies/mL, respectively. Among the 57 clinical samples from patients with COVID-19, 47 were tested positive by the kit B, while 35, 29, 28, 30, and 29 were found positive by the kits A, C, D, E, and F, respectively. The number of targets in a detection kit is not a key factor affecting sensitivity, while the amount of sample loading may influence the performance of a detection kit. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a guide when choosing or developing a nucleic acid detection kit for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Also, the absolute-quantification feature and high-sensitivity performance of ddPCR, suggesting that it can be used to review clinically suspected samples.","Hu, Xiaomei; Zhu, Lingxiang; Luo, Yijun; Zhao, Qinfei; Tan, Chianru; Chen, Xiao; Zhang, Huijuan; Hu, Xiaojun; Lu, Linping; Xiao, Yongwei; Huang, Shao; He, Yingke; Sim, Jacqueline Xiu Ling; Su, Shisheng; Wang, Fang; Peng, Yanke; Wang, Jigang; Guo, Yong; Zhong, Tianyu",Clin Chim Acta,,21

METHOD: Five patients with corneal opacity due to healed keratitis/optically failed therapeutic grafts along with pterygium or pseudopterygium underwent combined pterygium surgery by head inversion technique and corneal tattooing in the same sitting. All patients had no visual prognosis in that eye and surgery was indicated for cosmetic reasons only. RESULTS: At 6 months follow up no complications of pterygium surgery like recurrence, thinning, dellen, infections were noted in any patient. The dye was retained in the cornea and the cosmetic rehabilitation was excellent in all patients. DISCUSSION: Corneal tattooing combined with pterygium/pseudopterygium surgery can be performed in a single sitting with this novel technique in eyes with no visual potential. This is particularly suitable for eyes with limbal stem cell deficiency or large pterygia/pseudopterygia where conjunctival autograft is not advisable. These patients are often apprehensive for an allograft from their only seeing other eye.","Bafna, Rahul Kumar; Kalra, Nidhi; Sinha, Rajesh",Eur J Ophthalmol,,21

The disruptions to daily life and the associated stresses of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have been perhaps most acutely felt by Black and Latinx children from low-income families, including first-generation and undocumented immigrants.1 Structural inequities, such as the lack of employer-sponsored insurance in the service and retail industries; barriers to applying for public benefits, even for those who qualify; chronic poverty; and the lack of linguistically and culturally effective services have contributed to the disproportionate impact. In this article, the authors consider how structural inequities have rendered Latinx children particularly vulnerable to the devastating physical and psychological effects of the pandemic, identify risk and protective factors that are related to mental health outcomes, and recommend ways in which child and adolescent psychiatrists can respond to the escalating needs.","Rothe, Eugenio M; Fortuna, Lisa R; Tobon, Amalia Londono; Postlethwaite, Alejandra; Sanchez-Lacay, J Arturo; Anglero, Yohanis Leonor",J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,,21

The lack of knowledge in the child and adolescent population about how to incorporate healthy habits in their daily lives, along with the rise of health devices and the introduction of healthcare in the syllabus, has led to the realization of the present study. The aim of this study was to identify the relevant health topics in a sample of adolescents for the later development of a mobile application (Healthy Jeart) that promotes the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits in adolescence. The information was gathered through the technique of nominal groups. The sample was recruited by nonprobability purposive sampling, with a total of 92 students from 4 educational centers of the province of Huelva (Spain). According to the obtained results, the most relevant categories were physical wellbeing (40.81%), psychological wellbeing (22.13%), interpersonal relationships and social skills (21.58%), toxic substances and addictions (10.35%) and sex habits (1.83%).

Currently, there is no effective treatment for PRRSV and PEDV, and commercial vaccines do not induce sterilizing immunity. In this study, we screened a library of 1000 compounds and identified two specific inhibitors, designated compounds 2 and 3, which target the PRRSV 3C-like serine protease (3CLSP). First, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of compounds 2 and 3 on PRRSV 3CLSP activity. Next, we determined the anti-PRRSV capacity of compounds 2 and 3 in MARC-145 cells and obtained EC(50) and CC(50) values of 57 μM (CC(50) = 479.9 μM) and 56.8 μM (CC(50) = 482.8 μM), respectively. Importantly, compounds 2 and 3 also targeted the PEDV 3C-like protease (3CL protease) and inhibited PEDV replication, showing EC(50) and CC(50) values of 100 μM (CC(50) = 533.8 μM) and 57.9 μM (CC(50) = 522.3 μM), respectively. Finally, our results indicated that the active sites (His39 in 3CLSP and His41 in 3CL protease) were conservative, and contacted compounds 2 and 3 via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces in the putative substrate-binding models. In summary, compounds 2 and 3 exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity and may facilitate the development of antiviral drugs against PRRSV and PEDV.","Shi, Yuejun; Lei, Yingying; Ye, Gang; Sun, Limeng; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo; Fu, Zhen F.; Yin, Ping; Song, Yunfeng; Peng, Guiqing",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113517311367; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.11.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29291994/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113517311367,21

Phylogenetic analysis, network tree, similarity plot analysis, Recombination Detection Program 4(RDP4) and sequence comparison revealed that 12 of the 20 isolates were likely the reisolated vaccine virus. One isolate, ck/CH/LSD/110857, was shown to have originated from recombination events between H120- and 4/91-like vaccine strains that did not result in changes of antigenicity and pathogenicity. The remaining seven IBV isolates were shown to have originated from recombination events between a 4/91-like vaccine strain and a GX-LY9-like virus, which were responsible for the emergence of a novel serotype. A vaccination-challenge test found that vaccination with the 4/91 vaccine strain did not provide protection against challenge with the recombinant viruses. In addition, the results showed that the recombination events between the vaccine and field strains resulted in altered genetics, serotype, antigenicity, and pathogenicity compared with those of their deduced parental viruses. The results are important not only because this virus is of economic importance to poultry industry, but also because it is important for elucidating the origin and evolution of other coronaviruses.","Han, Zongxi; Zhao, Wenjun; Chen, Yuqiu; Xu, Qianqian; Sun, Junfeng; Zhang, Tingting; Zhao, Yan; Liang, Shuling; Gao, Mengying; Wang, Qiuling; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28619134/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113517301438; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113517301438; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.01.039,21

This practice of smoking can lead to weakened defences of a smoker's respiratory epithelium, making the smoker vulnerable to respiratory diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019, tuberculosis and others. METHODS: This study evaluated the water quality and hygiene factors among 43 smokers of five villages in rural Luang Namtha Province. Water samples were collected from participant's TWPs and assessed for the presence of Escherichia coli, coliforms and aerobic plate count (APC) bacteria using the 3M Petrifilm. RESULTS: The microbial indicator testing results were 95% positive for the APC, 38% positive for coliforms and 17% positive for the E. coli indicator. The concentrations were highest for the APC, with an average of 10(6) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, followed by coliforms with <100 cfu/ml and lowest for E. coli with <10 cfu/ml. Most TWPs were infrequently cleaned, heavily used and contained a warm, brown-coloured water. CONCLUSIONS: The warm, dark and moist internal water container may facilitate microbial survival and growth. The use of a TWP adds several unstudied modes of transmission to a complex and common biobehavioural and environmental pathogen exposure. Future TWP cessation activities should be tailored to consider risks of infectious disease transmission.","Sinclair, Ryan G; Somsamouth, Khamphithoun; Sahar, Demetria; Englert, Robyn; Singh, Pramil",Int Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33049758/; https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihaa078,21

The purpose of this article is to clarify the various meanings that have been assigned to the term syndromic surveillance and to propose a refined categorization of the characteristics of these systems. Existing literature and conference proceedings were examined on syndromic surveillance from 1998 to 2010, focusing on low- and middle-income settings. Based on the 36 unique definitions of syndromic surveillance found in the literature, five commonly accepted principles of syndromic surveillance systems were identified, as well as two fundamental categories: specific and non-specific disease detection. Ultimately, the proposed categorization of syndromic surveillance distinguishes between systems that focus on detecting defined syndromes or outcomes of interest and those that aim to uncover non-specific trends that suggest an outbreak may be occurring. By providing an accurate and comprehensive picture of this field’s capabilities, and differentiating among system types, a unified understanding of the syndromic surveillance field can be developed, encouraging the adoption, investment in, and implementation of these systems in settings that need bolstered surveillance capacity, particularly low- and middle-income countries.","Katz, Rebecca; May, Larissa; Baker, Julia; Test, Elisa",J Epidemiol Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23856373/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jegh.2011.06.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210600611000050; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210600611000050,21

592416,A possible role for Clostridium difficile in the etiology of calf enteritis,2008-03-18,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex in calves impairs health and welfare and causes severe economic losses for the Stockperson. Early recognition of BRD should lead to earlier veterinary (antibiotic/anti-inflammatory) treatment interventions thereby reducing the severity of the disease and associated costs. Coughing is one of the clinical manifestations of BRD. It is believed that by automatically and continuously monitoring the sounds within calf houses, and analysing the coughing frequency, early recognition of BRD in calves is possible. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to develop an automated calf cough monitor and examine its potential as an early warning system for BRD in artificially reared dairy calves. The coughing sounds of 62 calves were continuously recorded by a microphone over a three-month period. A sound analysis algorithm was developed to distinguish calf coughs from other sounds (e.g. mechanical sounds). During the sound recording period the health of the calves was assessed and scored periodically per week by a trained human observer. Calves presenting with BRD received antibiotic and/or anti-inflammatory treatment and the dates of treatment were recorded. This treatment date reference served as a comparison for the investigation of whether an increase in coughing frequency could be related to calves developing BRD. The calf cough detection algorithm achieved 50.3% sensitivity, 99.2% specificity and 87.5% precision. Four out of five periods, where coughing frequency was observed to be increased, coincided with the development of BRD in more than one calf. This period of increased coughing frequency was always observed before the calves were treated. Therefore, the calf cough monitor has the potential to identify early onset of BRD in calves.","Vandermeulen, Joris; Bahr, Claudia; Johnston, Dayle; Earley, Bernadette; Tullo, Emanuela; Fontana, Ilaria; Guarino, Marcella; Exadaktylos, Vasileios; Berckmans, Daniel",Comput Electron Agric,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168169916305105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287575/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169916305105; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2016.07.014,21

However, with the convergence of these diverse technologies, various risks and security threats have emerged. To protect patients and improve telemedicine quality for patient safety, it is necessary to analyze these risks and security threats comprehensively and institute appropriate countermeasures. METHODS: The security threats likely to be encountered in each of seven telemedicine service areas were analyzed, and related data were collected directly through on-site surveys by a medical institution. Subsequently, an attack tree, the most popular reliability and risk modeling approach for systematically characterizing the potential risks of telemedicine systems, was examined and utilized with the attack occurrence probability and attack success probability as variables to provide a comprehensive risk assessment method. RESULTS: In this study, the most popular modelling method, an attack tree, was applied to the telemedicine environment, and the security concerns for telemedicine systems were found to be very large. Risk management and evaluation methods suitable for the telemedicine environment were identified, and their benefits and potential limitations were assessed.

These measures impacted daily life and mental well-being (MWB). The aims of this study were to explore the MWB impacts of COVID-19 on children and assess the associations among perceived changes in physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviors (SB), with perceived MWB changes, using a mixed-methods approach. METHODS: A convergent parallel mixed-methods design consisting of an online survey with a convenience sample and interviews was conducted from May through July 2020 with parents/caregivers of kindergarten through 5th graders in the St. Louis region. Survey domains assessed included child MWB, PA, and SB. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and qualitatively analyzed using a code book developed to elicit themes. Survey data was analyzed with chi-squared tests and logistic regressions. The dependent variable was perceived change in child MWB due to the impact of COVID-19. Independent variables included perceived changes in PA, SB, and child concerns about COVID-19. RESULTS: Sample size consisted of 144 surveys and 16 interviews. Most parents reported a perceived decrease in child MWB (74%), a decrease in child PA (61%), and an increase in child SB (91%). Discontentment with stay-at-home orders and concern about COVID-19 were associated with a perceived decrease in MWB. Children whose PA decreased were 53% less likely to have the same or better MWB (OR 0.47) and children whose outside PA decreased were 72% less likely to have the same or better MWB (OR 0.28). Common qualitative themes included difficulty in adjusting to COVID-19 restrictions due to school closures and lack of socializing, child concerns about family getting sick, and PA benefits for improving MWB. CONCLUSIONS: Based on parent perceptions, MWB decreased with COVID-19. Maintained or increased child PA improved the chances MWB would remain the same or improve. Parent interviews provide context to these findings by showing how COVID-19 impacted MWB and the associations between PA and MWB. Understanding protective factors for child MWB during COVID-19 is important to offset negative long-term health outcomes from this ongoing pandemic.

We describe the complete follow-up of a pregnant woman with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first trimester. The woman tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs in her seventh week of gestation and was admitted to a local hospital for treatment. Although the woman had a BMI above 28 and a total gestational weight gain of 21 kg, no pregnancy complications or severe complications related to SARS-CoV-2 were reported. An ultrasound scan identified no fetal abnormalities at 22 weeks. The pregnancy ended at term (37 weeks), and the newborn's birth weight was 3100 g. Placental insufficiency was revealed by placental histology examination but this appeared not to be related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemical tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, spike protein 1, and nucleocapsid proteins were negative. However, ACE-2 was positive in samples of the placenta, umbilical cord and fetal membrane. The baby was followed up through to 10 days after birth and grew normally.

594506,Large protein complex production using the SmartBac System - Strategies and Applications,2017-11-14,"Pervasive technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality and the Internet of Things, despite their great potential for improved workability and well-being of older workers, entail wide ethical concerns. Aligned with these considerations we emphasize the need to present from the viewpoint of ethics the risks of personalized ICT solutions that aim to remedy health and support the well-being of the ageing population at workplaces. The ethical boundaries of digital technologies are opaque. The main motivation is to cope with the uncertainties of workplaces’ digitization and develop an ethics framework, termed SmartFrameWorK, for personalized health support through ICT tools at workplace environments. SmartFrameWorK is built upon a five-dimensional approach of ethics norms: autonomy, privacy, transparency, trustworthiness and accountability to incite trust in digital workplace technologies. A typology underpins these principles and guides the ethical decision-making process with regard to older worker particular needs, context, data type-related risks and digital tools’ use throughout their lifecycle. Risk analysis of pervasive technology use and multimodal data collection, highlighted the imperative for ethically aware practices for older workers' activity and behaviour monitoring. The SmartFrameWorK methodology has been applied in a case study to provide evidence that personalized digital services could elicit trust in users through a well-defined framework. Ethics compliance is a dynamic process from participants’ engagement to data management. Defining ethical determinants is pivotal towards building trust and reinforcing better workability and well-being in older workers.","Segkouli, Sofia; Giakoumis, Dimitrios; Votis, Konstantinos; Triantafyllidis, Andreas; Paliokas, Ioannis; Tzovaras, Dimitrios",Univers Access Inf Soc,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10209-021-00829-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305502/,21
594787,Discovery of Novel Alphacoronaviruses in European Rodents and Shrews,2016-03-18,"OBJECTIVE: Endosonography (EUS) is a useful but complex diagnostic modality which requires advanced endoscopy training and guidance by a supervisor. Since learning curves vary among individuals, assessment of the actual competence among EUS trainees is important. DESIGN/METHODS: We designed a novel assessment tool entitled Global Assessment of Performance and Skills in EUS (GAPS-EUS) for assessing skills among EUS trainees. Five quality indicators were marked on a five-grade scale by the supervisor (Observer Score) and by the trainee (Trainee Score). Trainees were included in two high-volume centres (Gothenburg, Sweden, and Bologna, Italy). Outcomes were feasibility, patient safety, reliability, and validity of GAPS-EUS in trainee-performed EUS procedures. RESULTS: Twenty-two EUS-trainees were assessed in a total of 157 EUS procedures with a completion rate of 157/157 (100 %) and a patient adverse event rate of 2/157 (1.3 %; gastroenteritis n=1, fever n=1). GAPS-EUS showed a high measurement reliability (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient=0.87) and a high inter-rater reliability comparing the supervisor and the trainee (r=0.83, r(2)=0.69, p<0.001). The construct of GAPS-EUS was verified by comparing low-level and high-level performance procedures and the content validity by recording that the EUS-FNA manoeuvre resulted in a lower score than other aspects of EUS 3.07 (95% CI 2.91 to 3.23) vs 3.51 (95% CI 3.37 to 3.65) (p<0.001). External validity was confirmed via similar findings in both centres. CONCLUSION: GAPS-EUS is an easy-to-use and reliable tool with a recorded high validity for the assessment of competence among trainees in EUS. It can be recommended to centres involved in the education of future endosonographers.

594981,Cross-crystal averaging with search models to improve molecular replacement phases,2011-02-01,"BACKGROUND: To maintain control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic as lockdowns are lifted, it will be crucial to enhance alternative public health measures. For surveillance, it will be necessary to detect a high proportion of any new cases quickly so that they can be isolated, and people who have been exposed to them traced and quarantined. Here we introduce a mathematical approach that can be used to determine how many samples need to be collected per unit area and unit time to detect new clusters of COVID-19 cases at a stage early enough to control an outbreak. METHODS: We present a sample size determination method that uses a relative weighted approach. Given the contribution of COVID-19 test results from sub-populations to detect the disease at a threshold prevalence level to control the outbreak to 1) determine if the expected number of weekly samples provided from current healthcare-based surveillance for respiratory virus infections may provide a sample size that is already adequate to detect new clusters of COVID-19 and, if not, 2) to determine how many additional weekly samples were needed from volunteer sampling. RESULTS: In a demonstration of our method at the weekly and Canadian provincial and territorial (P/T) levels, we found that only the more populous P/T have sufficient testing numbers from healthcare visits for respiratory illness to detect COVID-19 at our target prevalence level-assumed to be high enough to identify and control new clusters. Furthermore, detection of COVID-19 is most efficient (fewer samples required) when surveillance focuses on healthcare symptomatic testing demand. In the volunteer populations: the higher the contact rates;the higher the expected prevalence level;and the fewer the samples were needed to detect COVID-19 at a predetermined threshold level. CONCLUSION: This study introduces a targeted surveillance strategy, combining both passive and active surveillance samples, to determine how many samples to collect per unit area and unit time to detect new clusters of COVID-19 cases. The goal of this strategy is to allow for early enough detection to control an outbreak.","Rees, E. E.; Rodin, R.; Ogden, N.

595407,"The roles of cytosolic quality control proteins, SGTA and the BAG6 complex, in disease",2018-12-18,"Research has shown that we are currently not doing this—822 million people are undernourished, a fact linked with almost half of child mortality globally.2 However, the solution to this problem cannot simply be to produce more food, particularly when the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted.3 The need for change is reflected in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 2.4 which aims to improve the sustainability of food production, increasing productivity while maintaining ecosystems, by 2030. Producing 1 kg of lamb or mutton requires 369.81 m2 of land compared with 12.22 m2 for 1 kg of poultry meat and 2.97 m2 for 1 kg of farmed prawns.5 Examining greenhouse-gas emissions associated with production of 1 kg of beef, poultry and root vegetables, it tells a similar story with 60, 6 and 0.4 kg CO2/kg, respectively.5 Irrigating cropland is the largest human use of freshwater, accounting for 66% of annual resources, while food production is responsible for approximately 30% of the global greenhouse-gas emissions.6 7 There has been significant coverage in the last number of years in strategies to adopt a plant based diet. If greenhouse-gas emissions continue along their current trajectory, vegetable and legume production could decrease by 35% by 2100 due to water shortage and amplified salinity.15 In the same time period, corn production may be cut by half by a 4º C increase in global temperatures, while a temperature increase of under 2º C (in line with the Paris Climate Accord) could possibly reduce American corn production by approximately 18%.16 From a dietary point of view, there are three universal challenges: obesity, undernutrition and climate change.","Bradfield, James; Trigueiro, Helena; Ray, Sumantra",BMJ Nutr Prev Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2020-000101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33521518/,21
595609,An epidemiological study of winter dysentery in fifteen herds in France,1990,"BACKGROUND: New York City (NYC) has been one of the hotspots of the COVID‐19 pandemic in the United States. By the end of April 2020, close to 165 000 cases and 13 000 deaths were reported in the city with considerable variability across the city's ZIP codes. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examine: (a) the extent to which the variability in ZIP code‐level case positivity can be explained by aggregate markers of socioeconomic status (SES) and daily change in mobility; and (b) the extent to which daily change in mobility independently predicts case positivity. METHODS: COVID‐19 case positivity by ZIP code was modeled using multivariable linear regression with generalized estimating equations to account for within‐ZIP clustering. Daily case positivity was obtained from NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and measures of SES were based on data from the American Community Survey. Changes in human mobility were estimated using anonymized aggregated mobile phone location systems. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that the socioeconomic markers considered together explained 56% of the variability in case positivity through April 1 and their explanatory power decreased to 18% by April 30. Changes in mobility during this time period are not likely to be acting as a mediator of the relationship between ZIP‐level SES and case positivity. During the middle of April, increases in mobility were independently associated with decreased case positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings present evidence that heterogeneity in COVID‐19 case positivity during NYC’s spring outbreak was largely driven by residents’ SES.","Lamb, Matthew R.; Kandula, Sasikiran; Shaman, Jeffrey",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12816; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280263/,21

This study was conducted to assess the relationship between time to consultation, presence of respiratory complications at hospital admission and fatal outcome of COVID 19 cases. METHODS: This was a case control design study which collected data from records of all COVID 19 patients admitted in Bafoussam Regional Hospital from March 2020 to April 2021. The association between the delay in seeking care, dyspnoea and blood oxygen level at admission, and fatal outcome was assessed by estimating crude and adjusted odd ratio. RESULTS: Of 400 included patients, 239 (59.75%) were male, 84 (23.73%) health professionals and 144 (36.0%) aged 64 years and above. The mean duration of hospitalization was 11.39 days and 120 (30.0%) admitted patient died. Seeking care during or before the end of the first day of symptom onset significantly reduced the risk (Adjusted (A) OR = 0.4 (0.16-0.98)) of fatal outcome, whereas waiting three (AOR=0.6(0.31-1.16))or seven days (AOR=0.91(0.47-1.75)) did not change this risk. Dyspnoea (AOR=2.71(1.38-5.29)) or oxygen level <95% (AOR=22.87(2.99-174.76)) significantly increased the risk of fatal outcome.

Firstly, the patient developed hypercalcemia due to elevated 1,25-didydroxyvitamin D. Although hypercalcemia in AITL is not rare (1-2% incidence), this case was unusual in that the complication developed when disease appeared stable and symptomatically, he was doing well otherwise. Hypercalcemia surprisingly resolved a few months later at a time when his disease appeared to be progressing. A year later, the patient presented with digital ischemia necessitating partial amputation of a finger. Pathological exam revealed granulomatous vasculitis of small and medium arterioles with infiltrating malignant T lymphocytes. Although skin manifestations are common in AITL, necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis with accompanying tumor cells leading to severe digital ischemia appears rare. Subsequently the patient developed profound pancytopenia with bone marrow confirming severe aplastic anemia.

Orthopaedic surgeons are at risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their close contact with patients in both outpatient and theatre environments. The aim of this review was to perform a literature review, including articles of other coronaviruses, to formulate guidelines for orthopaedic healthcare staff. METHODS: A search of Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, World Health Organization (WHO), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) databases was performed encompassing a variety of terms including ‘coronavirus’, ‘covid-19’, ‘orthopaedic’, ‘personal protective environment’ and ‘PPE’. Online database searches identified 354 articles. Articles were included if they studied any of the other coronaviruses or if the basic science could potentially applied to COVID-19 (i.e. use of an inactivated virus with a similar diameter to COVID-19). Two reviewers independently identified and screened articles based on the titles and abstracts. 274 were subsequently excluded, with 80 full-text articles retrieved and assessed for eligibility. Of these, 66 were excluded as they compared personal protection equipment to no personal protection equipment or referred to prevention measures in the context of bacterial infections. RESULTS: There is a paucity of high quality evidence surrounding COVID-19. This review collates evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks to put forward recommendations for orthopaedic surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic. The key findings have been summarized and interpreted for application to the orthopaedic operative setting.

We develop a nowcasting and forecasting framework that provides estimates for influenza incidence in Italy up to 4 weeks ahead. We make use of the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to produce the predictions of seasonal flu incidence. Our predictions outperform both a baseline autoregressive model and a second baseline based on product purchases.

Pediatric information in this aspect is limited. Our study aims to analyze the spectrum of co-infections in pediatric COVID-19 patients and determine the clinical as well as laboratory parameters predicting co-infection. METHODOLOGY: In this prospective observational study conducted from June to December 2020 in a single tertiary care institution, data pertaining to demographic, illness and treatment-related variables were analyzed among two subsets of pediatric patients of age 1 month–12 years with RT–PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection-Group A: those with confirmed co-infection and Group B: moderate to severe disease without co-infection. Among Group A, etiology of co-infection was characterized through relevant microbiological examination within 48 h admission. RESULT: Among our study population, 15.03% and 20.6% had co-infections and moderate to severe disease respectively. Among those with confirmed co-infection, 32.5%, 11.6% and 6.97% recorded blood culture, respiratory secretion and CSF growth, respectively, the picture being dominated by Methicillin resistant and sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Serum serology demonstrated Scrub typhus infection to be most prevalent. Concurrent respiratory viral infections were seen in 11.6%. Children with co-infection had significantly higher morbidity and need for supportive therapy. Predictors of co-infection were localization of infection, Neutrophil count ≥10×10(9), age-specific lymphopenia, CRP > 100 mg/dl and hyperferritinemia.

The COVID-19 pandemic has renewed interest in propolis products worldwide; fortunately, various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism are potential targets for propolis compounds. SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is characterized by viral spike protein interaction with cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2. This mechanism involves PAK1 overexpression, which is a kinase that mediates coronavirus-induced lung inflammation, fibrosis, and immune system suppression. Propolis components have inhibitory effects on the ACE2, TMPRSS2 and PAK1 signaling pathways; in addition, antiviral activity has been proven in vitro and in vivo. In pre-clinical studies, propolis promoted immunoregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including reduction in IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF-α. This immunoregulation involves monocytes and macrophages, as well as Jak2/STAT3, NF-kB, and inflammasome pathways, reducing the risk of cytokine storm syndrome, a major mortality factor in advanced COVID-19 disease. Propolis has also shown promise as an aid in the treatment of various of the comorbidities that are particularly dangerous in COVID-19 patients, including respiratory diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. Standardized propolis products with consistent bioactive properties are now available.

The past decade has evidenced the role of intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs)/(IDPRs) in viral and other diseases. In general, (IDPs)/(IDPRs) are considered as dynamic conformational ensembles that devoid of a specific 3D structure, being associated with various important biological phenomena. Viruses utilize IDPs/IDPRs to survive in harsh environments, to evade the host immune system, and to highjack and manipulate host cellular proteins. The role of IDPs/IDPRs in Rotavirus biology and pathogenicity are not assessed so far, therefore, we have designed this study to deeply look at the penetrance of intrinsic disorder in rotavirus proteome consisting 12 proteins encoded by 11 segments of viral genome. Also, for all human rotaviral proteins, we have deciphered molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are disorder based binding sites in proteins. Our study shows the wide spread of intrinsic disorder in several rotavirus proteins, primarily the nonstructural proteins NSP3, NSP4, and NSP5 that are involved in viral replication, translation, viroplasm formation and/or maturation.

By crossing population data with the results of a web-based survey focused on the timeframes January–April and May–December 2020, we found that among 334/518 responders, 28 had COVID-19 in 2020. Seventeen cases occurred in May–December, in parallel with trends in the general population and loosening of containment policy strength. Age > 40 years (p = 0.026), prednisone escalation (p = 0.008) and infected relatives (p < 0.001) were most significantly associated with COVID-19. Weaker associations were found with asthma, lymphadenopathy and azathioprine or cyclosporine treatment. Only 31% of patients with infected relatives developed COVID-19. Healthcare service disruptions were not associated with rising hospitalisations. Vaccination prospects were generally welcomed. Our data suggest that COVID-19 has a moderate impact on patients with SLE, which might be significantly modulated by public health policies, including vaccination.","Ramirez, Giuseppe A.; Argolini, Lorenza M.; Bellocchi, Chiara; Moroni, Luca; Della-Torre, Emanuel; Farina, Nicola; Caporali, Roberto F.; Beretta, Lorenzo; Gerosa, Maria; Bozzolo, Enrica P.; Dagna, Lorenzo",Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34478882/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1521661621001820; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2021.108845; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521661621001820?v=s5,21

However, NHBE cells are expensive, difficult to culture, and vary with the source patient. An alternate approach is to use a continuous cell line that has features of bronchial epithelial cells such as Calu-3, an epithelial cell line derived from human lung adenocarcinoma, as an in vitro model of respiratory virus infection. The results show that Calu-3 fully polarize when grown on permeable supports as liquid-covered cultures. Polarized Calu-3 are susceptible to RSV infection and release infectious virus primarily from the apical surface, consistent with studies in NHBE cells. The data demonstrate that polarized Calu-3 may serve as a useful in vitro model to study host responses to RSV infection.","Harcourt, Jennifer L.; Caidi, Hayat; Anderson, Larry J.; Haynes, Lia M.",J Virol Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093411001182; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.03.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21458491/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093411001182,21
602520,Overview of Biologically Active Nucleoside Phosphonates,2021-01-08,"Objective: We examined the antibody response of pregnant women who delivered at Mount Sinai Hospital with a SARS-CoV 2 infection between the study interval of March 15, 2020 through April 30, 2020. Study Design: This was a prospective observational study examining the immune response of pregnant women who delivered at Mount Sinai Hospital with a PCR confirmed SARS-CoV 2 infection. Women with a SARS-CoV 2 infection were contacted via phone and scheduled for a phlebotomy visit to assess their antibody titer levels to COVID 19. The COVID-19 ELISA IgG Antibody Test was used to evaluate the patients’ antibody titers. Results: 122 patients were identified as being diagnosed and delivered with SARS-CoV 2 in the pre-specified time frame. Of those patients, 25 women agreed to participate and were included in this study. 64.00% were Caucasian with an average age of 35 years. Demographic variables are illustrated in Table 1. The majority of women were asymptomatic for COVID-19 at the time of admission (80.00 %) and the average gestational age of delivery and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 39 weeks gestation (Table 1). The later the gestational age at the time of diagnosis, the lower the antibody titer response (Table 2). When examining interval from diagnosis to antibody titer level, patients with the highest titers (2880) tended to have a shorter interval between their COVID-19 diagnosis and the time at which the titer level was drawn (73 vs 87 vs 77 days for patients with titers of 1:2880, 960 and 320 respectively). In addition, patients with symptoms on admission were slightly more likely to have a higher antibody titer level (80.00% of symptomatic patients had a reported antibody level of 960 or 2880). Conclusion: The antibody response among women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy, appears to be greater when the patients are diagnosed at an earlier gestational age. Antibody titers were assessed greater than 4 weeks from the time of initial diagnosis, however beyond this time period the shorter the interval between diagnosis and assessment of antibody titer level, the more robust the apparent immune response.

Forty-four young couples (n = 88) aged between 18 and 36 years old participated in the study (53.4% women; M = 24.18; SD = 4.34). Twenty-two couples belonged to the experimental group (received the intervention) and 22 to the control group (received no intervention). The intervention program consisted of seven two-hour sessions over a month, in groups of four to five couples. The variables studied were sociodemographic characteristics, emotional intelligence (TMMS-24), emotional inter-regulation with the partner (SIERC), attachment (ECR-S) and satisfaction with the relationship (RAS). The proposed design was quasi-experimental, with two randomized groups (experimental and control group) and longitudinal data from two occasions. SPSS version 24.0 was used to perform analysis of variance (MANOVA and MANCOVA), multiple hierarchical regression and reliable change index. PROCESS was also used for moderation analyses. The results indicate that the program is effective in increasing emotional self-regulation and emotion regulation with the partner, as well as reducing couples’ avoidance of intimacy. Age, relationship duration and previous relationship satisfaction moderate the effectiveness of the program. The importance of continuing this research line to address well-being of young populations is discussed.","Mónaco, Estefanía; de la Barrera, Usue; Montoya-Castilla, Inmaculada",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572448/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041677,21

However, there is noticeable the lack of clinical trials that confirm the efficacy, security, absence of side effects in the short and long term, and the effective doses of melatonin. This point is especially important in diseases with high morbidity and mortality including COVID‐19. There is not treatment for COVID‐19, and several anti‐inflammatory and antiviral molecules are being tested, and different vaccines are in preparation. Although the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic is apparently improving, it is expected new resurges next fall. Thus, looking for an effective treatment of COVID‐19 is mandatory. Melatonin has significant anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, and mitochondrial protective effects, and its efficacy has been demonstrated in multiple experimental models of disease and in a clinical trial in sepsis. Because COVID‐19 courses with a severe septic response, multiple reviews proposing melatonin as a treatment for COVID‐19 have been published. Nevertheless, there is a lack of experimental and clinical data on the use of melatonin on SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Accordingly, we designed a clinical trial with an injectable formulation of melatonin for intravenous perfusion in ICU patients suffering from COVID‐19 that has been just approved by the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS). The trial will allow by the first time understand the doses and efficacy of melatonin against COVID‐19.","Acuña‐Castroviejo, Dario; Escames, Germaine; Figueira, Juan C.; de la Oliva, Pedro; Borobia, Alberto M.; Acuña‐Fernández, Carlos",J Pineal Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32770854/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jpi.12683,21

Upon infection, DMVs have been shown to harbor the replicase complex of positive-strand RNA viruses such as MHV, poliovirus, and equine arteritis virus. Recently, it has been shown that autophagy proteins are proviral factors that favor initiation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Here, we identified ATG5 as an interacting protein for the HCV NS5B. ATG5/NS5B interaction was confirmed by co-IP and metabolic labeling studies. Furthermore, ATG5 protein colocalizes with NS4B, a constituent of the membranous web. Importantly, immunofluorescence staining demonstrated a strong colocalization of ATG5 and NS5B within perinuclear regions of infected cells at 2days postinfection. However, colocalization was completely lacking at 5DPI, suggesting that HCV utilizes ATG5 as a proviral factor during the onset of viral infection. Finally, inhibition of autophagy through ATG5 silencing blocks HCV replication.","Guévin, Carl; Manna, David; Bélanger, Claudia; Konan, Kouacou V.; Mak, Paul; Labonté, Patrick",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.05.032; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682210003764; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2925245/pdf/nihms227865.pdf?origin%3Dpublication_detail; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20580051/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682210003764,21

AIM: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the in-hospital incidence of acute PE among COVID-19 patients based on studies published within four months of COVID-19 outbreak. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched Medline, Scopus and Web of Science to locate all articles published up to August 1, 2020 reporting the incidence of acute PE (or lung thrombosis) in COVID-19 patients. The pooled in-hospital incidence of acute PE among COVID-19 patients was calculated using a random effects model and presenting the related 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I(2) statistic. RESULTS: We analysed data from 7178 COVID-19 patients [mean age 60.4 years] included in twenty-three studies. Among patients hospitalized in general wards and intensive care unit (ICU), the pooled in-hospital incidence of PE (or lung thrombosis) was 14.7% of cases (95% CI: 9.9–21.3%, I(2)=95.0%, p<0.0001) and 23.4% (95% CI:16.7–31.8%, I2=88.7%, p<0.0001), respectively. Segmental/sub-segmental pulmonary arteries were more frequently involved compared to main/lobar arteries (6.8% vs18.8%, p<0.001). Computer tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was used only in 35.3% of patients with COVID-19 infection across six studies. CONCLUSIONS: The in-hospital incidence of acute PE among COVID-19 patients is higher in ICU patients compared to those hospitalized in general wards. CTPA was rarely used suggesting a potential underestimation of PE cases.","Roncon, Loris; Zuin, Marco; Barco, Stefano; Valerio, Luca; Zuliani, Giovanni; Zonzin, Pietro; Konstantinides, Stavros V",Eur J Intern Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953620520303496?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2020.09.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0953620520303496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32958372/,21
605036,Modeling mitigation of influenza epidemics by baloxavir,2020-06-02,"Population density, behaviour and cultural habits strongly influence the spread of pathogens. Consequently, key epidemiological parameters may vary from country to country. Confirmed COVID-19 cases in in China have been used to estimate those parameters, that vary largely (reviewed in 1). The estimates also depend on testing frequency and case definitions that are prone to change during ongoing epidemics, providing additional uncertainties. The rise in fatal cases due to SARS-CoV2 could be a more reliable parameter, since missing of deaths is less likely. In the absence of changes in the management of severe COVID-19 cases, the rise in death cases should be proportional to the rise in virus infections. Although the fluctuating low numbers of fatal cases very early in the epidemic may lead to some uncertainty, more than 100 deaths per day are reported since 10.03.2020 in Italy and since 21.03.2020 in the US. Therefore, the dynamics of deaths were analysed to estimate the daily reproduction numbers (Rt) and the effectiveness of control measures. Thus, our analysis provides evidence that basic epidemiological parameters differ between countries to an extent compromising epidemiological predictions of the pandemic. It also suggests that suppression of spread in Italy and the US may be more difficult to achieve. Although we assume that variations in social behaviour are responsible for the different estimates of R0, selection of more rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded. Despite uncertainty in the reliability of the data used and lack of information on possible changes in the effectiveness of registration of COVID-19 deaths during the observation period, our findings should be considered as a working hypothesis demanding further investigations. As the number of deaths rapidly increases worldwide, we encourage more sophisticated modelling of the epidemic based on the dynamics of death cases by experts in the field.","Ensser, Armin; Ueberla, Klaus",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046094,21

Methods: In order to carry out the research the modified SIR-model was used as the basic epidemic one. As the economic growth model was used the model of probability of mixed economic systems, developed by authors. The consolidation of such models to its lowest terms allowed to form the combined digital economic-epidemic model. As basic ones were considered three potentially possible options for the implementation of quarantine measures. On the basis of the model, developed by authors, were developed feasibility studies for each of three options of quarantine measures. While carrying out calculations as initial terms was adopted the dynamics of the daily accrual of people, infected withCOVID-19 for the week between 01.04 and 08.04.2020.

While control measures are being taken, research into the biomedical and socio-cultural aspects of the pandemic, relevant to the African population, should not be ignored. It should not be assumed that research performed in Asian, American and European populations will always be applicable to Africa. Rather, research should be done in Africa to answer questions peculiar to the epidemic on the continent and help inform international guidelines. National guidelines for treatment and prevention, patient recoveries and discharge, and public health control measures should be based on research performed in the appropriate context for them to be effective and robust.

606877,Post-translational glycosylation of coronavirus glycoprotein E1: inhibition by monensin.,1982,"BACKGROUND: Despite widespread interest in the use of virtual (ie, telephone and video) visits for ambulatory patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic, studies examining their adoption during the pandemic by race, sex, age, or insurance are lacking. Moreover, there have been limited evaluations to date of the impact of these sociodemographic factors on the use of telephone versus video visits. Such assessments are crucial to identify, understand, and address differences in care delivery across patient populations, particularly those that could affect access to or quality of care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine changes in ambulatory visit volume and type (ie, in-person vs virtual and telephone vs video visits) by patient sociodemographics during the COVID-19 pandemic at one urban academic medical center. METHODS: We compared volumes and patient sociodemographics (age, sex, race, insurance) for visits during the first 11 weeks following the COVID-19 national emergency declaration (March 15 to May 31, 2020) to visits in the corresponding weeks in 2019. Additionally, for visits during the COVID-19 study period, we examined differences in visit type (ie, in-person versus virtual, and telephone versus video visits) by sociodemographics using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Total visit volumes in the COVID-19 study period comprised 51.4% of the corresponding weeks in 2019 (n=80,081 vs n=155,884 visits). Although patient sociodemographics between the COVID-19 study period in 2020 and the corresponding weeks in 2019 were similar, 60.5% (n=48,475) of the visits were virtual, compared to 0% in 2019. Of the virtual visits, 61.2% (n=29,661) were video based, and 38.8% (n=18,814) were telephone based. In the COVID-19 study period, virtual (vs in-person) visits were more likely among patients with race categorized as other (vs White) and patients with Medicare (vs commercial) insurance and less likely for men, patients aged 0-17 years, 65-74 years, or ≥75 years (compared to patients aged 18-45 years), and patients with Medicaid insurance or insurance categorized as other. Among virtual visits, compared to telephone visits, video visits were more likely to be adopted by patients aged 0-17 years (vs 18-45 years), but less likely for all other age groups, men, Black (vs White) patients, and patients with Medicare or Medicaid (vs commercial) insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual visits comprised the majority of ambulatory visits during the COVID-19 study period, of which a majority were by video. Sociodemographic differences existed in the use of virtual versus in-person and video versus telephone visits. To ensure equitable care delivery, we present five policy recommendations to inform the further development of virtual visit programs and their reimbursement.","Gilson, Sarah F; Umscheid, Craig A; Laiteerapong, Neda; Ossey, Graeme; Nunes, Kenneth J; Shah, Sachin D",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33191247/; https://doi.org/10.2196/24544,21

Antiviral drugs continue to be an important option for the treatment of influenza disease and will likely be the only option during the early phases of pandemic. However, the limited number of drug classes licensed for treatment of influenza raises several issues, particularly in the face of drug resistance. Two classes of drugs are presently licensed for treatment of influenza, M2 and neuraminidase inhibitors. M2 inhibitors are currently not recommended for treatment of influenza because of widespread resistance and resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has been observed during the past influenza seasonal outbreaks. Additional antiviral drugs with novel mechanisms of action are clearly needed for the treatment of influenza. Fortunately, the landscape of drugs in early and advanced development has dramatically increased over the last 5 years. Drugs targeting viral functions such as attachment, entry/fusion, transcription, and polymerase and drugs targeting host factors affecting viral replication are currently in clinical trials.

607728,Interactions Between Virus Proteins and Host Cell Membranes During the Viral Life Cycle,2005-08-25,"BACKGROUND: Patient selection and cannulation arguably represent the key steps for the successful implementation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Cannulation is traditionally performed in the operating room or the catheterization laboratory for a number of reasons, including physician preference and access to real‐time imaging, with the goal of minimizing complications and ensuring appropriate cannula positioning. Nonetheless, the patients' critical and unstable conditions often require emergent initiation of ECMO and preclude the safe transport of the patient to a procedural suite. AIMS: Therefore, with the objective of avoiding delay with the initiation of therapy and reducing the hazard of transport, we implemented a protocol for bedside ECMO cannulation. MATHERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 89 patients required ECMO support at Hennepin County Medical Center between March 2015 and December 2019. Twenty‐eight (31%) required veno‐venous support and were all cannulated at the bedside. Overall survival was 71% with no morbidity or mortality related to the cannulation procedure. CONCLUSION: In the current pandemic, the strategy of veno‐venous bedside cannulation may have additional benefits for the care of patients with refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease‐2019, decreasing the risk of exposure of health care worker or other patients to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 occurring during patient transport, preparation, or during disinfection of the procedural suite and the transportation pathway after ECMO cannulation.","Calcaterra, Domenico; Heather, Beth; Kohl, Louis P.; Erickson, Heidi L.; Prekker, Matthew E.",J Card Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531129/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.14641,21

609025,Peptide-mediated Cell and In Vivo Delivery of Antisense Oligonucleotides and siRNA,2012-06-12,"A “superspreader” refers to an unusually contagious organism infected with a disease. With respect to a human borne illnesses, a superspreader is someone who is more likely to infect other humans when compared to a typically infected person. The existence of human superspreaders is deeply entrenched in history; the most famous case being that of Typhoid Mary. Through contact tracing, epidemiologists have identified human superspreaders in measles, tuberculosis, rubella, monkeypox, smallpox, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and SARS. The recent outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has shifted the focus back on the superspreaders. We herein present a case report of a COVID-19 superspreader with a hitherto unusually high number of infected contacts. The index case was a 33 year old male who resided in a low income settlement comprising of rehabilitated slum dwellers and worked as a healthcare worker (HCW) in a tertiary care hospital and had tested positive for COVID-19.On contact tracing, he had a total of 125 contacts, of which 49 COVID-19 infections had direct or indirect contact with the index case, qualifying him as a “superspreader.” This propagated infection led to an outbreak in the community. Contact tracing, testing and isolation of such superspreaders from the other members of the community is essential to stop the spread of this disease and contain the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mohindra, Ritin; Ghai, Arushi; Brar, Rinnie; Khandelwal, Neha; Biswal, Manisha; Suri, Vikas; Goyal, Kapil; Singh, Mini P.; Bhalla, Ashish; Rana, Kirtan; Lakshmi, P.

Why is only one class of cyclic peptides found in mammals? Possibly we have not looked hard enough for them, or the technologies needed to identify them are not fully developed. We also do not yet understand their intriguing biosynthesis from two separate gene products. Addressing these challenges will require the application of chemical tools and insights from other classes of cyclic peptides. Herein, we highlight recent developments in the characterization of theta defensins and describe the important role that chemistry has played in delineating their modes of action. Furthermore, we emphasize the potential of theta defensins as antimicrobial agents and scaffolds for peptide drug design.","Conibear, Anne C.; Craik, David J.",Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25079086/; https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201402167,21

The question is relevant because, initially, vaccine availability will likely be limited. After healthcare and some other essential workers, it might seem the most obvious candidates are the elderly and other groups that are more vulnerable to the virus. However, we argue that this is not necessarily the case. Protecting the most vulnerable might require prioritizing vaccinating children in order to maximize the benefits of indirect immunity for the elderly and the other vulnerable groups. Whether this will be the best strategy from a public health perspective will depend on characteristics of the vaccine and of the virus, which are currently unknown. Here, we assess this possibility from an ethical point of view, by drawing comparisons and analogies with the case of the flu vaccination and with other examples of health policies and practices. We conclude that there are strong ethical reasons to vaccinate the young to protect the old, provided that the risks imposed on children are reasonable, even if that implies using children as a means to protect the elderly and the vulnerable.","Giubilini, Alberto; Savulescu, Julian; Wilkinson, Dominic",J Law Biosci,https://doi.org/10.1093/jlb/lsaa050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32959006/,21

These essential immune responses are triggered by common TLR pattern recognition receptors of microbial products expressed through the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal Toll/IL-1 domain. Toll/IL-1 adapter protein cascades are induced by an activated Toll/IL-1 to induce transient transcription responses. All TLRs, with the exception of TLR3, use an MyD88 adapter to Toll/IL-1 to initiate a proinflammatory cascade. TLR3 uses the toll receptor 3/4 induction factor adapter to initiate a different cytosolic adapter cascade with double-stranded RNA agonists. This non-MyD88 pathway induces both NF-κB and type 1 interferon responses. By using a TLR3-restricted double-stranded RNA agonist, rintatolimod, we demonstrate significant unexpected differences in toxic responses between rats and primates. The mechanism of this differential response is consistent with a relative down-regulation of the NF-κB inflammatory cytokine induction pathway in the cynomolgus monkey and humans, but not observed systemically in rat. Our findings suggest evaluation of TLR3 agonists in drug therapy.","Mitchell, William M.; Nicodemus, Christopher F.; Carter, William A.; Horvath, Joseph C.; Strayer, David R.",Am J Pathol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000294401400011X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000294401400011X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486326/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.12.006,21

Methods: Systematic review in five engines, pre-print webpages and RCT registries until May 22, 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies evaluating remdesivir on confirmed, COVID-19 adults with pneumonia and/or respiratory insufficiency. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, clinical improvement or recovery, need for invasive ventilation, and serious adverse events (SAE). Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, progression of pneumonia, and adverse events (AE). Inverse variance random effects meta-analyses were performed. Results: Two placebo-controlled RCTs (n=1300) and two case series (n=88) were included. All studies used remdesivir 200mg IV the first day and 100mg IV for 9 more days, and followed up until 28 days. Wang et al. RCT was stopped early due to AEs; ACTT-1 was preliminary reported at 15-day follow up. Time to clinical improvement was not decreased in Wang et al. RCT, but median time to recovery was decreased by 4 days in ACTT-1. Remdesivir did not decrease all-cause mortality (RR 0.71, 95%CI 0.39 to 1.28) and need for invasive ventilation at 14 days (RR 0.57, 95%CI 0.23 to 1.42), but had fewer SAEs (RR 0.77, 95%CI 0.63 to 0.94). AEs were similar between remdesivir and placebo arms. Risk of bias ranged from some concerns to high risk in RCTs.

Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China spreads rapidly since December, 2019. Most patients show mild symptoms, but some of them develop into severe disease. There is currently no specific medication. The purpose of this study is to to explore changes of markers in peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients, which may be of value in disease monitoring. Methods Clinical data of patients with nonsevere and severe type COVID-19 diagnosed by laboratory test in our institution were collected. The relationship between peripheral blood cells and cytokines, clinical manifestation and outcome was analyzed. Results A total of 69 severe type COVID-19 patients were included. On admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% female patient. The most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement and interstitial abnormalities evidenced by chest computed tomography (CT) imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed obvious lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly increased in severe type, which was closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to CT findings. Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patients whose IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to disease progression. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a marker for disease monitoring in severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusions On admission, the baseline level of IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin was closely related to the severity of COVID-19, and the elevated IL-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. The decrease of IL-6 was closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of IL-6 indicated disease exacerbation. Collectively, the dynamic change of IL-6 level can be used as a marker for disease monitoring in patients with severe COVID-19.","Liu, Tao; Zhang, Jieying; Yang, Yuhui; Ma, Hong; Li, Zhengyu; Zhang, Jiaoyue; Cheng, Ji; Zhang, Xiaoyun; Zhao, Yanxia; Xia, Zihan; Zhang, Liling; Wu, Gang; Yi, Jianhua",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029769,21

We aimed to assess the performance of this modified EB mask and to test its use during different gas mixture supplies. CPAP set at 5, 10, and 15 cmH(2)O was delivered to 10 healthy volunteers with a high-flow system generator set at 40, 80, and 120 L min(−1) and with a turbine-driven ventilator during both spontaneous and loaded (resistor) breathing. Inspiratory CO(2) partial pressure (PiCO(2)), pressure inside the mask, breathing pattern and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) were measured at all combinations of CPAP/flows delivered, with and without the resistor. Using the high-flow generator set at 40 L min(−1), the PiCO(2) significantly increased and the system was unable to maintain the target CPAP of 10 and 15 cmH(2)O and a stable pressure within the respiratory cycle; conversely, the turbine-driven ventilator did. EAdi significantly increased with flow rates of 40 and 80 L min(−1) but not at 120 L min(−1) and with the turbine-driven ventilator. EB mask can be safely used to deliver CPAP only under strict constraints, using either a high-flow generator at a flow rate greater than 80 L min(−1), or a high-performance turbine-driven ventilator.","Noto, Alberto; Crimi, Claudia; Cortegiani, Andrea; Giardina, Massimiliano; Benedetto, Filippo; Princi, Pietro; Carlucci, Annalisa; Appendini, Lorenzo; Gregoretti, Cesare",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85093-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692464/,21

COVID-19 also causes organ dysfunction, complicating cancer treatment. In most countries with an outbreak of COVID-19, modifications of cancer management have been adopted to accommodate the crisis and minimize the exposure of cancer patients to the infection. In countries where COVID-19 numbers are subsiding, medical teams should also be prepared to resume normal practices gradually. Here, we aim to review the literature on the impact of COVID-19 on patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as discuss modifications to the management of HCC during and after recovery from the pandemic. SUMMARY: Based on current data, 10–40% of patients with COVID-19 have hepatic injury characterized by an elevation of transaminases and/or hyperbilirubinemia. Multiple mechanisms contribute to the hepatic injury, including direct viral entry to hepatocytes/cholangiocytes, immune-mediated hepatitis, hypoxia, and drug-related hepatotoxicity. In patients with HCC, COVID-19 may exacerbate existing chronic liver disease and complicate the management of cancer. Cancer patients generally have a higher risk of infection and worse outcome, especially those who have recently undergone cancer treatment. Although HCC is under-represented in COVID-19 series, mitigation measures should be implemented to minimize the exposure of patients to the virus. A decision on the treatment of HCC should be balanced with consideration of the availability of medical resources, the level of infection risk of COVID-19, and the risk-benefit ratio of the individual patient. In areas where the COVID-19 outbreak is subsiding, clinicians should be prepared to manage a surge of HCC patients with higher disease burdens and complications. KEY MESSAGES: Mitigation measures to protect at-risk patients, such as those with cancers, from SARS-CoV-2 infection should be exercised and the impact of COVID-19 on this group of patients should be thoroughly studied.","Chan, Stephen Lam; Kudo, Masatoshi",Liver Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078127/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000510765,21
624027,Fat(al) attraction: Picornaviruses Usurp Lipid Transfer at Membrane Contact Sites to Create Replication Organelles,2016-03-22,"COVID-19 pandemic in Italy displayed a spatial distribution that made the tracking of its time course quite difficult. The most relevant anomaly was the marked spatial heterogeneity of COVID-19 diffusion. Lombardia region accounted for around 60% of fatal cases (while hosting 15% of Italian population). Moreover, 86% of fatalities concentrated in four Northern Italy regions. The ‘explosive’ outbreak of COVID-19 in Lombardia at the very beginning of pandemic fatally biased the R-like statistics routinely used to control the disease dynamics. To (at least partially) overcome this bias, we propose a new index RI = dH/dI (daily derivative ratio of H and I, given H = Healed and I = Infected), corresponding to the ratio between healed and infected patients relative daily changes. The proposed index is less flawed than R by the uncertainty related to the estimated number of infected persons and allows to follow (and possibly forecast) epidemic dynamics in a largely model-independent way. To analyze the dynamics of the epidemic, starting from the beginning of the virus spreading—when data are insufficient to make an estimate by adopting SIR model—a ""sigmoidal family with delay"" logistic model was introduced. That approach allowed in estimating the epidemic peak using the few data gathered even before mid-March. Based on this analysis, the peak was correctly predicted to occur by end of April. Analytical methodology of the dynamics of the epidemic we are proposing herein aims to forecast the time and intensity of the epidemic peak (forward prediction), while allowing identifying the (more likely) beginning of the epidemic (backward prediction). In addition, we established a relationship between hospitalization in intensive care units (ICU) versus deaths daily rates by avoiding the necessity to rely on precise estimates of the infected fraction of the population The joint evolution of the above parameters over time allows for a trustworthy and unbiased estimation of the dynamics of the epidemic, allowing us to clearly detect the qualitatively different character of the ‘so-called’ second wave with respect to the previous epidemic peak.","Bizzarri, Mariano; Di Traglia, Mario; Giuliani, Alessandro; Vestri, Annarita; Fedeli, Valeria; Prestininzi, Alberto",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33353964/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79039-x,21
624919,Harnessed viruses in the age of metagenomics and synthetic biology: an update on infectious clone assembly and biotechnologies of plant viruses,2019-02-28,"The network of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) represents the filamentous (F)-actin rich tubular structure which is connected to the cytoplasm of the adjacent and or distant cells to mediate efficient cell-to-cell communication. They are long cytoplasmic bridges with an extraordinary ability to perform diverse array of function ranging from maintaining cellular physiology and cell survival to promoting immune surveillance. Ironically, TNTs are now widely documented to promote the spread of various pathogens including viruses either during early or late phase of their lifecycle. In addition, TNTs have also been associated with multiple pathologies in a complex multicellular environment. While the recent work from multiple laboratories has elucidated the role of TNTs in cellular communication and maintenance of homeostasis, this review focuses on their exploitation by the diverse group of viruses such as retroviruses, herpesviruses, influenza A, human metapneumovirus and SARS CoV-2 to promote viral entry, virus trafficking and cell-to-cell spread. The later process may aggravate disease severity and the associated complications due to widespread dissemination of the viruses to multiple organ system as observed in current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In addition, the TNT-mediated intracellular spread can be protective to the viruses from the circulating immune surveillance and possible neutralization activity present in the extracellular matrix. This review further highlights the relevance of TNTs in ocular and cardiac tissues including neurodegenerative diseases, chemotherapeutic resistance, and cancer pathogenesis. Taken together, we suggest that effective therapies should consider precise targeting of TNTs in several diseases including virus infections.","Tiwari, Vaibhav; Koganti, Raghuram; Russell, Greer; Sharma, Ananya; Shukla, Deepak",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.680891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34194434/,21

SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally to cause significant morbidity and mortality, and there still remain unknowns about the biology and pathology of the virus. Even with testing, tracing, and social distancing, many countries are struggling to contain SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 will only be suppressible when herd immunity develops, either because of an effective vaccine or if the population has been infected and is resistant to reinfection. There is virtually no chance of a return to pre-COVID-19 societal behavior until there is an effective vaccine. Concerted efforts by physicians, academic laboratories, and companies around the world have improved detection and treatment and made promising early steps, developing many vaccine candidates at a pace that has been unmatched for prior diseases. As of August 11, 2020, 28 of these companies have advanced into clinical trials with Moderna, CanSino, the University of Oxford, BioNTech, Sinovac, Sinopharm, Anhui Zhifei Longcom, Inovio, Novavax, Vaxine, Zydus Cadila, Institute of Medical Biology, and the Gamaleya Research Institute having moved beyond their initial safety and immunogenicity studies.

625938,The Alpha Keto Amide Moiety as a Privileged Motif in Medicinal Chemistry: Current Insights and Emerging Opportunities,2021-03-25,"OBJECTIVE: During the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, organ transplantation was classified a CMS Tier 3b procedure which should not be postponed. The differential impact of the pandemic on access to liver transplantation was assessed. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Disparities in organ access and transplant outcomes among vulnerable populations have served as obstacles in liver transplantation. METHODS: Using UNOS STARfile data, adult waitlisted candidates were identified from March 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020 (n = 21,702 pandemic) and March 1, 2019 to November 30, 2019 (n = 22,797 pre-pandemic), and further categorized and analyzed by time periods: March to May (Period 1), June to August (Period 2), and September to November (Period 3). Comparisons between pandemic and pre-pandemic groups included: Minority status, demographics, diagnosis, MELD, insurance type, and transplant center characteristics. Liver transplant centers (n = 113) were divided into tertiles by volume (small, medium, large) for further analyses. Multivariable logistic regression was fitted to assess odds of transplant. Competing risk regression was used to predict probability of removal from the waitlist due to transplantation or death and sickness. Additional temporal analyses were performed to assess changes in outcomes over the course of the pandemic. RESULTS: During Period 1 of the pandemic, Minorities showed greater reduction in both listing (−14% vs −12% Whites), and transplant (−15% vs −7% Whites), despite a higher median MELD at transplant (23 vs 20 Whites, P < 0.001). Of candidates with public insurance, Minorities demonstrated an 18.5% decrease in transplants during Period 1 (vs −8% Whites). Although large programs increased transplants during Period 1, accounting for 61.5% of liver transplants versus 53.4% pre-pandemic (P < 0.001), Minorities constituted significantly fewer transplants at these programs during this time period (27.7% pandemic vs 31.7% pre-pandemic, P = 0.04). Although improvements in disparities in candidate listings, removals, and transplants were observed during Periods 2 and 3, the adjusted odds ratio of transplant for Minorities was 0.89 (95% CI 0.83–0.96, P = 0.001) over the entire pandemic period. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19's effect on access to liver transplantation has been ubiquitous. However, Minorities, especially those with public insurance, have been disproportionately affected. Importantly, despite the uncertainty and challenges, our systems have remarkable resiliency, as demonstrated by the temporal improvements observed during Periods 2 and 3. As the pandemic persists, and the aftermath ensues, health care systems must consciously strive to identify and equitably serve vulnerable populations.","MacConmara, Malcolm; Wang, Benjamin; Patel, Madhukar S.; Hwang, Christine S.; DeGregorio, Lucia; Shah, Jigesh; Hanish, Steven I.; Desai, Dev; Lynch, Raymond; Tanriover, Bekir; Zeh, Herbert; Vagefi, Parsia A.",Ann Surg,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183513/,21

Few studies have concentrated on the learner's perspectives involved with the transition from traditional to online learning. The aim of this study was to assess students' attitudes towards online learning as well as the perceived preparedness and barriers. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional, correlational web-based survey design was used to recruit eligible participants from five Jordanian government universities. A Facebook-based campaign and snowball sampling approach were used to recruit potential survey participants. RESULTS: The results show that 1,210 medical college students decided to take part in this online survey. Students' attitudes and perceived preparedness for online learning were moderate, while perceived barriers were high. This study revealed a connection between students' attitudes toward online learning and their gender, major, living area, college level, and prior experience. The main obstacles to online learning were an unstable Internet connection, a lack of motivation, and a lack of instructions. CONCLUSION: The majority of students had mixed feelings about online learning and were largely supportive of conventional classroom learning. Students were pessimistic about their chances of learning professional skills and core competencies online. More research is required to determine whether students are ready and able to make greater use of online education in order to access high-quality learning opportunities.","Muflih, Suhaib; Abuhammad, Sawsan; Al-Azzam, Sayer; Alzoubi, Karem H.; Muflih, Mohammad; Karasneh, Reema",Heliyon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021021344; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34568607/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844021021344,21
626428,Coronavirus Translational Regulation: Leader Affects mRNA Efficiency,1994-08-01,"Interleukin‐6 (IL‐6)–mediated hyperinflammation may contribute to the mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). The IL‐6 receptor–blocking monoclonal antibody tocilizumab has been repurposed for COVID‐19, but prospective trials and dose‐finding studies in COVID‐19 have not yet fully reported. We conducted a single‐arm phase II trial of low‐dose tocilizumab in nonintubated hospitalized adult patients with COVID‐19, radiographic pulmonary infiltrate, fever, and C‐reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 40 mg/L. We hypothesized that doses significantly lower than the emerging standards of 400 mg or 8 mg/kg would resolve clinical and laboratory indicators of hyperinflammation. A dose range from 40 to 200 mg was evaluated, with allowance for one repeat dose at 24 to 48 hours. The primary objective was to assess the relationship of dose to fever resolution and CRP response. Thirty‐two patients received low‐dose tocilizumab, with the majority experiencing fever resolution (75%) and CRP decline consistent with IL‐6 pathway abrogation (86%) in the 24–48 hours following drug administration. There was no evidence of a relationship between dose and fever resolution or CRP decline over the dose range of 40–200 mg. Within the 28‐day follow‐up, 5 (16%) patients died. For patients who recovered, median time to clinical recovery was 3 days (interquartile range, 2–5). Clinically presumed and/or cultured bacterial superinfections were reported in 5 (16%) patients. Low‐dose tocilizumab was associated with rapid improvement in clinical and laboratory measures of hyperinflammation in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19.

627067,Physicochemical tools for studying virus interactions with targeted cell membranes in a molecular and spatiotemporally resolved context,2021-09-07,"IMPORTANCE: It is unclear whether burnout, anxiety, and depression constitute the same or different constructs. Better understanding of these constructs is important for diagnosis and treatment for intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians. OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations and distinctiveness of burnout, depression, and anxiety in a sample of ICU clinicians. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used baseline data from the ICU Visits Study, a cluster-randomized crossover clinical trial conducted from April 2017 to July 2018 in 36 mixed public and private nonprofit ICUs in Brazil. ICU clinicians, including day-shift physicians, nurses, nurse technicians, and physiotherapists working in an ICU at least 20 hours per week, were enrolled. Data were analyzed from December 27, 2019, to October 10, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome measures were burnout, depression, and anxiety measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI; range, 0-6, with high scores indicating more burnout) and the Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale (HADS; range, 0-3, with higher scores indicating more depression or anxiety). Internal consistencies were satisfactory. RESULTS: The total sample included 715 ICU clinicians (median [interquartile range] age, 34.8 [30.2-39.3] years; 520 [72.7%] women), including 96 physicians (13.4%), 159 nurses (22.2%), 358 nurse technicians (50.1%), and 102 physiotherapists (14.3%). Clinicians reported low levels of emotional exhaustion (mean [SD] score, 1.84 [1.18]), depersonalization (mean [SD] score, 0.98 [1.03]), and personal accomplishment (mean [SD] score, 5.05 [0.87]) on the MBI, and similarly low levels of depression (mean [SD] score, 0.54 [0.40]) and anxiety (mean [SD] score, 0.70 [0.45]) on the HADS. Confirmatory factor analyses consistently showed improved fit separating latent burnout dimensions from depression and anxiety. An exploratory graph analysis combining gaussian graphical model with clustering algorithms for weighted networks suggested 3 clusters, with distinct burnout, anxiety, and depression clusters. This structure was confirmed using a bootstrap with 1000 random samples, in which the 3-cluster solution emerged in 625 samples (62.5%). Both latent variable loadings and network statistics suggested 3 key indicators (ie, feeling burned out from work, worrying thoughts, and reverse-scored reporting feeling cheerful) that can be used for short screening instruments. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that burnout and clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety were empirically distinct in a large sample of ICU clinicians, highlighting the importance of screening for burnout and clinical symptoms to allow fast access to adequate support and treatment in health professionals at high risk of burnout.","Fischer, Ronald; Mattos, Paulo; Teixeira, Cassiano; Ganzerla, Daniel S.; Rosa, Regis Goulart; Bozza, Fernando A.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355676/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.30898,21

627677,Molecular Features of the Measles Virus Viral Fusion Complex That Favor Infection and Spread in the Brain,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND: The antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties of azithromycin suggest therapeutic potential against COVID-19. Randomised data in mild-to-moderate disease are not available. We assessed whether azithromycin is effective in reducing hospital admission in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. METHODS: This prospective, open-label, randomised superiority trial was done at 19 hospitals in the UK. We enrolled adults aged at least 18 years presenting to hospitals with clinically diagnosed, highly probable or confirmed COVID-19 infection, with fewer than 14 days of symptoms, who were considered suitable for initial ambulatory management. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to azithromycin (500 mg once daily orally for 14 days) plus standard care or to standard care alone. The primary outcome was death or hospital admission from any cause over the 28 days from randomisation. The primary and safety outcomes were assessed according to the intention-to-treat principle. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04381962) and recruitment is closed. FINDINGS: 298 participants were enrolled from June 3, 2020, to Jan 29, 2021. Three participants withdrew consent and requested removal of all data, and three further participants withdrew consent after randomisation, thus, the primary outcome was assessed in 292 participants (145 in the azithromycin group and 147 in the standard care group). The mean age of the participants was 45·9 years (SD 14·9). 15 (10%) participants in the azithromycin group and 17 (12%) in the standard care group were admitted to hospital or died during the study (adjusted OR 0·91 [95% CI 0·43–1·92], p=0·80). No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: In patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 managed without hospital admission, adding azithromycin to standard care treatment did not reduce the risk of subsequent hospital admission or death. Our findings do not support the use of azithromycin in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

The purpose of this study was to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on EMS responses to and outcomes of adult OHCA in an area of South Korea. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of adult OHCA patients attended by EMS providers comparing the EMS responses to and outcomes of adult OHCA during the COVID-19 pandemic to those during the pre-COVID-19 period. Propensity score matching was used to compare the survival rates, and logistic regression analysis was used to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the survival of OHCA patients. RESULTS: A total of 891 patients in the pre-COVID-19 group and 1,063 patients in the COVID-19 group were included in the final analysis. During the COVID-19 period, the EMS call time was shifted to a later time period (16:00–24:00, P < 0.001), and the presence of an initial shockable rhythm was increased (pre-COVID-19 vs. COVID-19, 7.97% vs. 11.95%, P = 0.004). The number of tracheal intubations decreased (5.27% vs. 1.22%, P < 0.001), and the use of mechanical chest compression devices (30.53% vs. 44.59%, P < 0.001) and EMS response time (median [quartile 1-quartile 3], 7 [5–10] vs. 8 [6–11], P < 0.001) increased. After propensity score matching, the survival at admission rate (22.52% vs. 18.24%, P = 0.025), survival to discharge rate (7.77% vs. 5.52%, P = 0.056), and favorable neurological outcome (5.97% vs. 3.49%, P < 0.001) decreased. In the propensity score matching analysis of the impact of COVID-19, odds ratios of 0.768 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.592–0.995) for survival at admission and 0.693 (95% CI, 0.446–1.077) for survival to discharge were found. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 period, there were significant changes in the EMS responses to OHCA. These changes are considered to be partly due to social distancing measures. As a result, the proportion of patients with an initial shockable rhythm in the COVID-19 period was greater than that in the pre-COVID-19 period, but the final survival rate and favorable neurological outcome were lower.","Lim, Daesung; Park, Song Yi; Choi, Byungho; Kim, Sun Hyu; Ryu, Ji Ho; Kim, Yong Hwan; Sung, Ae Jin; Bae, Byung Kwan; Kim, Han Byeol",J Korean Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34519188/,21

Given the large surface area and extensive ventilation of the lung, it is prone to exposure to airborne substances, such as pathogens, allergens, chemicals, and particulate matter. Highly elaborate and effective mechanisms have evolved to protect and maintain homeostasis in the lung. Despite these sophisticated defense mechanisms, the respiratory system remains highly susceptible to environmental challenges. Because of the impact of respiratory exposure on human health and disease, there has been considerable interest in developing reliable and predictive in vitro model systems for respiratory toxicology and basic research. Human air-liquid-interface (ALI) organotypic airway tissue models derived from primary tracheobronchial epithelial cells have in vivo–like structure and functions when they are fully differentiated. The presence of the air-facing surface allows conducting in vitro exposures that mimic human respiratory exposures. Exposures can be conducted using particulates, aerosols, gases, vapors generated from volatile and semi-volatile substances, and respiratory pathogens. Toxicity data have been generated using nanomaterials, cigarette smoke, e-cigarette vapors, environmental airborne chemicals, drugs given by inhalation, and respiratory viruses and bacteria. Although toxicity evaluations using human airway ALI models require further standardization and validation, this approach shows promise in supplementing or replacing in vivo animal models for conducting research on respiratory toxicants and pathogens.","Cao, Xuefei; Coyle, Jayme P.; Xiong, Rui; Wang, Yiying; Heflich, Robert H.; Ren, Baiping; Gwinn, William M.; Hayden, Patrick; Rojanasakul, Liying",In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11626-020-00517-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33175307/,21

630178,Building genomes to understand biology,2020-12-02,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is having major adverse consequences for the mental health of individuals worldwide. Alongside the direct impact of the virus on individuals, government responses to tackling its spread, such as quarantine, lockdown, and physical distancing measures, have been found to have a profound impact on mental health. This is manifested in an increased prevalence of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. As older adults are more vulnerable and severely affected by the pandemic, they may be at increased psychological risk when seeking to protect themselves from COVID-19. Methods: Our study aims to quantify the association between the stringency of measures and increased feelings of sadness/depression in a sample of 31,819 Europeans and Israelis aged 65 and above. We hypothesize that more stringent measures make it more likely that individuals will report increased feelings of sadness or depression. Conclusions: We found that more stringent measures across countries in Europe and Israel affect the mental health of older individuals. The prevalence of increased feelings of sadness/depression was higher in Southern European countries, where the measures were more stringent. We therefore recommend paying particular attention to the possible effects of pandemic control measures on the mental health of older people.","Voss, Gina; Paiva, Andreia F.; Delerue Matos, Alice",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18158017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360310/,21
630789,"Origin, Adaptation and Evolutionary Pathways of Fungal Viruses",1998,"BACKGROUND: Maintaining compliance with personal preventive measures is important to achieve a balance of COVID-19 pandemic control and work resumption. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate self-reported compliance with four personal measures to prevent COVID-19 among a sample of factory workers in Shenzhen, China, at the beginning of work resumption in China following the COVID-19 outbreak. These preventive measures included consistent wearing of face masks in public spaces (the workplace and other public settings); sanitizing hands using soap, liquid soap, or alcohol-based hand sanitizer after returning from public spaces or touching public installations and equipment; avoiding social and meal gatherings; and avoiding crowded places. METHODS: The participants were adult factory workers who had resumed work in Shenzhen, China. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used. We randomly selected 14 factories that had resumed work. All full-time employees aged ≥18 years who had resumed work in these factories were invited to complete a web-based survey. Out of 4158 workers who had resumed work in these factories, 3035 (73.0%) completed the web-based survey from March 1 to 14, 2020. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted. RESULTS: Among the 3035 participants, 2938 (96.8%) and 2996 (98.7%) reported always wearing a face mask in the workplace and in other public settings, respectively, in the past month. However, frequencies of self-reported sanitizing hands (2152/3035, 70.9%), avoiding social and meal gatherings (2225/3035, 73.3%), and avoiding crowded places (1997/3035, 65.8%) were relatively low. At the individual level, knowledge about COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] from 1.16, CI 1.10-1.24, to 1.29, CI 1.21-1.37), perceived risk (AORs from 0.58, CI 0.50-0.68, to 0.85, CI 0.72-0.99) and severity (AOR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.09, and AOR 1.07, CI 1.03-1.11) of COVID-19, perceived effectiveness of preventive measures by the individual (AORs from 1.05, CI 1.00-1.10, to 1.09, CI 1.04-1.13), organization (AOR 1.30, CI 1.20-1.41), and government (AORs from 1.14, CI 1.04-1.25, to 1.21, CI 1.02-1.42), perceived preparedness for a potential outbreak after work resumption (AORs from 1.10, CI 1.00-1.21, to 1.50, CI 1.36-1.64), and depressive symptoms (AORs from 0.93, CI 0.91-0.94, to 0.96, CI 0.92-0.99) were associated with self-reported compliance with at least one personal preventive measure. At the interpersonal level, exposure to COVID-19–specific information through official media channels (AOR 1.08, CI 1.04-1.11) and face-to-face communication (AOR 0.90, CI 0.83-0.98) were associated with self-reported sanitizing of hands. The number of preventive measures implemented in the workplace was positively associated with self-reported compliance with all four preventive measures (AORs from 1.30, CI 1.08-1.57, to 1.63, CI 1.45-1.84). CONCLUSIONS: Measures are needed to strengthen hand hygiene and physical distancing among factory workers to reduce transmission following work resumption. Future programs in workplaces should address these factors at multiple levels.","Pan, Yihang; Fang, Yuan; Xin, Meiqi; Dong, Willa; Zhou, Liemin; Hou, Qinghua; Li, Fanping; Sun, Gang; Zheng, Zilong; Yuan, Jinqiu; Wang, Zixin; He, Yulong",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32924947/; https://doi.org/10.2196/22457,21

Currently, global health is facing its devastating outbreak. However, there is no vaccine available against this virus up to now. In this study, a novel multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was designed to provoke both innate and adaptive immune responses. The immunodominant regions of six non-structural proteins (nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, nsp12 and nsp14) of SARS-CoV-2 were selected by multiple immunoinformatic tools to provoke T cell immune response. Also, immunodominant fragment of the functional region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (400–510 residues) protein was selected for inducing neutralizing antibodies production. The selected regions’ sequences were connected to each other by furin-sensitive linker (RVRR). Moreover, the functional region of β-defensin as a well-known agonist for the TLR-4/MD complex was added at the N-terminus of the vaccine using (EAAAK)3 linker. Also, a CD4 + T-helper epitope, PADRE, was used at the C-terminal of the vaccine by GPGPG and A(EAAAK)2A linkers to form the final vaccine construct. The physicochemical properties, allergenicity, antigenicity, functionality and population coverage of the final vaccine construct were analyzed. The final vaccine construct was an immunogenic, non-allergen and unfunctional protein which contained multiple CD8 + and CD4 + overlapping epitopes, IFN-γ inducing epitopes, linear and conformational B cell epitopes. It could form stable and significant interactions with TLR-4/MD according to molecular docking and dynamics simulations. Global population coverage of the vaccine for HLA-I and II were estimated 96.2% and 97.1%, respectively. At last, the final vaccine construct was reverse translated to design the DNA vaccine. Although the designed vaccine exhibited high efficacy in silico, further experimental validation is necessary.","Safavi, Ashkan; Kefayat, Amirhosein; Mahdevar, Elham; Abiri, Ardavan; Ghahremani, Fatemeh",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X20313074; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20313074?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.10.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33082015/,21

In line with the job demands-resources model, optimism was expected to positively relate with job resources, leading to higher work engagement. However, the underlying mechanism between optimism, autonomy and work engagement has not been explored. AIMS: To examine whether optimism has a positive impact on work engagement via autonomy among physicians fighting COVID-19 in China. METHODS: This study was conducted among physicians in March 2020. A convenience sample was used to recruit physicians from the Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital and Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. One hundred and four Chinese physicians working in the COVID-19 epidemic completed a survey measuring levels of autonomy, optimism and work engagement. The PROCESS macro (model 4) was used to test hypotheses about mediation. RESULTS: This current study found that optimism was related to increased autonomy, and autonomy was related to increased work engagement. The results of the bias-corrected bootstrap method suggested the indirect effect of optimism on work engagement via autonomy (Effect = 0.16, SE = 0.08, lower level confidence interval = 0.04, upper level confidence interval = 0.37), indicating a mediated relationship, in which autonomy is one mechanism to explain the link between optimism and increased work engagement. CONCLUSIONS: This study follows an observational design, with in-depth analysis of the relationship between optimism, autonomy and work engagement. When management implements strategies to improve work engagement among physicians working in the COVID-19 epidemic, the mediating impact of autonomy on the association between optimism and work engagement should be considered.","Zhang, H; Zhao, Y; Zou, P; Liu, Y; Gan, L",Occup Med (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1093/occmed/kqaa203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33289031/,21

New problems and challenges arose, as well as opportunities. Numerous studies have examined the negative effects of lockdown measures, but few have attempted to shine light on the potential positive effects that may come out of these measures. We focused on one particular positive outcome that might have emerged from lockdown: creativity. To this end, this paper compared self-reported professional creativity (Pro-C) and everyday creativity (little-c) before and during lockdown, using a questionnaire-based study conducted on a French sample (N = 1266). We expected participants to be more creative during than prior to lockdown, in both professional and everyday spheres. Regarding Pro-C, we did not see any significant differences between the two comparison points, before and during lockdown. Regarding everyday creativity, we observed a significant increase during lockdown. Furthermore, our results suggest that participants with a lower baseline creativity (before lockdown) benefited more from the situation than those with a higher initial baseline creativity. Our results provide new insights on the impact of lockdown and its positive outcomes. These measures may have inarguably negative consequences on the physical and mental health of many, but their positive impact exists as well.","Mercier, Maxence; Vinchon, Florent; Pichot, Nicolas; Bonetto, Eric; Bonnardel, Nathalie; Girandola, Fabien; Lubart, Todd",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536973/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.601150,21

We studied the clinical characteristics of survivor and non-survivor COVID-19-infected cancer patients in Pakistan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We did a retrospective study of 70 cancer patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection from Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore and Peshawar, Pakistan between April 13 and July 09, 2020. These patients were discharged from the hospital or had died by July 09, 2020. Clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics were compared between survivors and non-survivors by fisher’s exact test and chi-square test. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to explore the risk factors of mortality. RESULTS: Seventy cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled and the majority were males 38 (54.3%). 57 (81.4%) had solid tumors and 13 (18.6%) had hematological malignancies. Dyspnea (44 cases) was the most common symptom (62.9%). Complications were reported in 51 (72.9%) patients during the course of disease. 19 (27.1%) patients were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). A significant increase in the C-reactive protein level and neutrophil count was observed in the deceased patients as compared to the surviving patients. D-dimer values of ≥0.2 mg/L were significantly associated with mortality (P=0.01). We identified two independent risk factors associated with death, ICU admission (P=0.007) and D-dimer (P=0.003). CONCLUSION: Pakistani cancer patients with COVID-19 infection reported poor prognosis. Intensive surveillance of clinicopathological characteristics of cancer patients infected with COVID-19 especially D-dimer values may play a pivotal role in the outcome of the disease.","Asghar, Kashif; Abu Bakar, Muhammad; Akram, Muhammad Junaid; Farooq, Asim; Siddique, Kashif; Rana, Iftikhar Ali; Ali, Jamshed; Rashid, Muhammad Usman; Khan, Ashraf Ali; Loya, Asif",Front Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.655634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34094950/,21

634550,Trends in Antiviral Strategies,2015-10-01,"Objectives Evaluate six commercial serological assays for detection of IgA, IgM or IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in different disease severities. Methods Three lateral flow tests (LFTs) (Acro IgM/IgG, CTK IgM/IgG, Livzon IgM/IgG) and three ELISA assays (Euroimmun IgA and IgG, Wantai IgM) were included. Application was evaluated in samples from 57 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients stratified according to disease severity. Specificity was assessed using historical samples from 200 blood donors. Results While IgM LFTs failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 37–84% of non-hospitalised cases, the Wantai IgM ELISA detected antibodies in 79%. The Euroimmun IgG ELISA detected antibodies in 95% of non-hospitalised subjects. IgA, IgM and IgG ELISA levels were initially low, increased over time and correlated with disease severity. LFT sensitivity declined in samples taken >28 days after symptom onset/resolution. The Livzon IgG LFT had the highest specificity (98.5%), followed by the Euroimmun IgG ELISA (96.2%). The specificity for Euroimmun IgA ELISA improved (≥97.5%) using a custom cut-off value (4.0). Conclusions The sensitive and semi-quantitative ELISA assays are most appropriate for serologic detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mild cases. Livzon LFT and Euroimmun ELISA had the highest specificity among the IgG assays, making them most suitable for seroprevalence studies.","Nilsson, Anna Christine; Holm, Dorte Kinggaard; Justesen, Ulrik Stenz; Gorm-Jensen, Thøger; Andersen, Nanna Skaarup; Øvrehus, Anne; Johansen, Isik Somuncu; Michelsen, Jens; Sprogøe, Ulrik; Lillevang, Søren Thue",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.12.017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220325406?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220325406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33310021/,21

Here, we investigated the impact of agavins intake on gut microbiota modulation and their metabolites as well as their effect on metabolic endotoxemia and low-grade inflammation in mice fed high-fat diet. Mice were fed with a standard diet (ST) and high-fat diet (HF) alone or plus an agavins supplement (HF+A) for ten weeks. Gut microbiota composition, fecal metabolite profiles, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and systemic effects were analyzed. Agavins intake induced substantial changes in gut microbiota composition, enriching Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Prevotella, Allobaculum, and Akkermansia genus (LDA > 3.0). l-leucine, l-valine, uracil, thymine, and some fatty acids were identified as possible biomarkers for this prebiotic supplement. As novel findings, agavins supplementation significantly decreased LPS and pro-inflammatory (IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α; p < 0.05) cytokines levels in portal vein. In addition, lipid droplets content in the liver and adipocytes size also decreased with agavins consumption. In conclusion, agavins supplementation mitigate metabolic endotoxemia and low-grade inflammation in association with gut microbiota regulation and their metabolic products, thus inducing beneficial responses on metabolic disorders in high-fat diet-fed mice.","Huazano-García, Alicia; Silva-Adame, María Blanca; Vázquez-Martínez, Juan; Gastelum-Arellanez, Argel; Sánchez-Segura, Lino; López, Mercedes G.",Foods,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods9121792; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33287102/,21
634759,Mechanisms of Airborne Infection via Evaporating and Sedimenting Droplets Produced by Speaking,2020-07-15,"Human coronaviruses (HCoV) were discovered in the 1960s and were originally thought to cause only mild upper respiratory tract diseases in immunocompetent hosts. This view changed since the beginning of this century, with the 2002 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic and the 2012 MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreak, two zoonotic infections that resulted in mortality rates of approximately 10% and 35%, respectively. Despite the importance of these pathogens, no approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of human coronavirus infections became available. However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug originally developed for the treatment of Ebola virus, was found to inhibit the replication of a wide range of human and animal coronaviruses in vitro and in preclinical studies. It is therefore not surprising that when the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged in late 2019 in China, causing global health concern due to the virus strong human-to-human transmission ability, remdesivir was one of the first clinical candidates that received attention. After in vitro studies had shown its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, and a first patient was successfully treated with the drug in the USA, a number of trials on remdesivir were initiated. Several had encouraging results, particularly the ACTT-1 double blind, randomized, and placebo controlled trial that has shown shortening of the time to recovery in hospitalized patients treated with remdesivir. The results of other trials were instead negative. Here, we provide an overview of remdesivir discovery, molecular mechanism of action, and initial and current clinical studies on its efficacy.","Santoro, M.

This review examines the evidence regarding toilet plume bioaerosol generation and infectious disease transmission. METHODS: The peer-reviewed scientific literature was searched to identify articles related to aerosol production during toilet flushing, as well as epidemiologic studies examining the potential role of toilets in infectious disease outbreaks. RESULTS: The studies demonstrate that potentially infectious aerosols may be produced in substantial quantities during flushing. Aerosolization can continue through multiple flushes to expose subsequent toilet users. Some of the aerosols desiccate to become droplet nuclei and remain adrift in the air currents. However, no studies have yet clearly demonstrated or refuted toilet plume-related disease transmission, and the significance of the risk remains largely uncharacterized.

However, knowledge on the relationship between long-term maintained healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, and the risk of SARS-2-Cov infection is still sparse. We longitudinally assessed this association in a well-known Mediterranean cohort. METHODS: We assessed 9677 participants from the SUN Project, a prospective cohort of middle-aged university graduates in Spain. We inquired about a positive result in a COVID-19 diagnostic test during the months of February to December 2020. After excluding health professionals (HP), 5194 participants were included in the statistical analyses (mean age: 52.6, SD: 12.4; 55.2% women). Food habits were assessed at baseline using a previously validated semiquantitative 136-item food frequency questionnaire. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (cumulative average of 2 repeated measurements separated 10 years apart) was assessed using the 0-to-9 Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). We used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for incident COVID-19 according to the MDS. RESULTS: Among 5194 non-HP participants, 122 reported to have received a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on a specific diagnostic test. Participants with intermediate adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MDS ≥4 & <7) had a significantly lower odds of developing COVID-19 (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.50, 95% CI, 0.34–0.73), and those with the highest adherence (MDS ≥ 7) exhibited the lowest risk (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.36, 0.16–0.84, p for trend < 0.001) as compared with participants with MDS ≤3. This inverse association remained robust within subgroups and in sensitivity analyses. Notwithstanding, no significant associations were observed for health professionals (p for interaction = 0.06). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, better adherence to the Mediterranean diet may be associated with a lower risk of COVID-19.

This study aimed to compare the utilisation of healthcare services for RTIs between individuals with and without diabetes attending primary healthcare centres (PHCCs) in Qatar. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using an electronic database of all individuals who had a diagnosis of RTI. SETTING: PHCCs in Qatar from July 2015 to December 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Participants in the study were all adult individuals (aged ≥18 years) who visited the primary healthcare facilities and were diagnosed with an RTI during the study period. PRIMARY AND OUTCOME MEASURES: For each participant, visits to the healthcare facility, antibiotic use and use of other medications were extracted from the electronic database and compared between participants with and without a diabetes diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 32 857 participants were included, of whom 7407 (22.5%) had a diabetes diagnosis. Results from a negative binomial regression indicate that diabetes diagnosis was significantly associated with increased visits to the healthcare facility (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.10, 95% CI 1.076 to 1.134, p<0.001), antibiotic use (IRR 1.09, 95% CI 1.046 to 1.145, p<0.001) and use of other medications (IRR 1.11, 95% CI 1.078 to 1.143, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A diabetes diagnosis among patients with RTI was associated with higher utilisation of healthcare services. Given the added costs to the healthcare system, prevention of diabetes will have additional benefits to the healthcare system, apart from diabetes-associated costs alone.","Islam, Nazmul; Chivese, Tawanda; Alam, M Fasihul",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323446/,21
636032,ISG15 in antiviral immunity and beyond,2018-05-16,"Here we have analyzed the dynamics of the adaptive immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 in severely affected COVID-19 patients, as reflected by activated B cells egressing into the blood, at the single cell level. Early on, before seroconversion in response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, activated peripheral B cells displayed a type 1 interferon-induced gene expression signature. After seroconversion, activated B cells lost this signature, expressed IL-21- and TGF-{beta}-induced gene expression signatures, and mostly IgG1 and IgA1. In the sustained immune reaction of the COVID-19 patients, until day 59, activated peripheral B cells shifted to expression of IgA2, reflecting instruction by TGF-{beta}. Despite the continued generation of activated B cells, those cells were not found in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients, nor did the IgA2 bind to dominant antigens of SARS-CoV-2. In severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 thus triggers a chronic immune reaction distracted from itself and instructed by TGF-{beta}.","Ferreira-Gomes, Marta; Kruglov, Andrey; Durek, Pawel; Heinrich, Frederik; Tizian, Caroline; Heinz, Gitta Anne; Pascual-Reguant, Anna; Du, Weijie; Mothes, Ronja; Fan, Chaofan; Frischbutter, Stefan; Habenicht, Katharina; Budzinski, Lisa; Ninnemann, Justus; Jani, Peter K.; Guerra, Gabriela; Lehmann, Katrin; Matz, Mareen; Ostendorf, Lennard; Heiberger, Lukas; Chang, Hyun-Dong; Bauherr, Sandy; Maurer, Marcus; Schoenrich, Guenther; Raftery, Martin; Kallinich, Tilmann; Mall, Marcus Alexander; Angermair, Stefan; Treskatsch, Sascha; Doerner, Thomas; Corman, Victor M; Diefenbach, Andreas; Volk, Hans-Dieter; Elezkurtaj, Sefer; Winkler, Thomas H.; Dong, Jun; Hauser, Anja Erika; Radbruch, Helena; Witkowski, Mario; Melchers, Fritz; Radbruch, Andreas; Mashreghi, Mir-Farzin",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188169; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.04.20188169v1?rss=1,21

The challenge now is ensuring that these services remain sustainable. This review investigates the cost-effectiveness of videoconference and telephone consultations in primary care settings, by summarizing the available published evidence. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and CINAHL databases was used to identify articles published from January 2000 to July 2020, using keyword synonyms for telehealth, primary care, and economic evaluation. Databases were searched, and title, abstract, and full-text reviews were conducted. Article reporting quality was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist. RESULTS: Twenty articles were selected for inclusion, with 12 describing telephone triage services, seven describing telehealth substitution services, and one describing another telehealth service in primary care. These services were delivered by nurses, doctors, and allied health clinicians. Of the 20 included studies, 11 used cost analyses, five used cost-minimization analyses, and four used one or more methods, including either a cost-consequence analysis, a cost-utility analysis, or a cost-effectiveness analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone and videoconference consultations in primary care were cost-effective to the health system when deemed clinically appropriate, clinician when time was used efficiently, and when overall demand on health services was reduced. The societal benefits of telehealth consultations should be considered an important part of telehealth planning and should influence funding reform decisions for telehealth services in primary care.","De Guzman, Keshia R; Snoswell, Centaine L; Caffery, Liam J; Smith, Anthony C",J Telemed Telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x211043380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34617819/,21

Campania's strategy for digitalization of health and care and for healthy aging is based on a person-centered, life-course, “One Health” approach, where demographic change is considered capable of stimulating a growth dynamic linked to the opportunities of combining the “Silver Economy” with local assets and the specific health needs of the population. The end-users (citizens, patients, and professionals) contribute to the co-creation of products and services, being involved in the identification of unmet needs and test-bed activity. The Campania Reference Site of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Aging is a flexible regional ecosystem to address the challenge of an aging population with a life-course approach.

637277,Mechanisms of viral emergence,2010-02-05,"Calves are highly susceptible to disease and mortality occurrence within the first month of life. Even if failed transfer of passive immunity (FTPI) is commonly recognized as a main factor affecting calf health and survival, conflicting results are reported in literature about the association between passive immunity (PI) and calf health, especially regarding enteric diseases. Therefore, a prospective cohort study was conducted on 78 calves of three Italian dairy farms during winters of years 2014–2016, with the specific aim of evaluating the association between PI and health status of calves within 30 days of age under field conditions. Blood samples were collected between 1 and 5 days of age from each calf included in the study, and disease and mortality occurrence was monitored throughout the first month of life. Additionally, fecal samples were collected from calves with scours before treatment. Blood serum samples were tested by an electrophoretic method for the assessment of immunoglobulin (Ig) concentration, whereas fecal samples were submitted to ELISA test for positivity to Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium spp. Only enteric diseases occurred in calves of this study. Calves that suffered from diarrhea or died within the first month of life had lower serum Ig concentrations than those that remained healthy or survived (P < .05). Even if not significantly (P = .127), lower serum Ig concentrations were observed in sick calves that had been treated with antibiotics compared to those that had not been treated. The odds of disease and mortality occurrence were 24 (95% CI = 3–231) and 11 (95% CI = 1–111) times higher, respectively, for calves with FTPI (serum Ig concentration <10.0 g/L) than for those with an adequate PI transfer (P < .05). Calves with adequate PI transfer had also a 6-day delay in the age at first disease onset compared to those with FTPI (P < .01). Even if estimated on a small number of calves, those with FTPI had higher risks of enteric infections by rotavirus (odds ratio = 12; 95% CI = 1–137) and Cryptosporidium spp. (odds ratio = 9; 95% CI = 1–72) (P < .05). In this study, the PI level influenced the occurrence of enteric diseases and mortality in calves under one month of age, confirming the importance of a proper colostrum provision to calf health and, consequently, to the reduction of antimicrobial use in dairy farming. However, further investigations are needed, particularly focusing on the relationship between PI and specific enteropathogen infections in calves.","Lora, Isabella; Gottardo, Flaviana; Contiero, Barbara; Dall Ava, Brunella; Bonfanti, Lebana; Stefani, Annalisa; Barberio, Antonio",Prev Vet Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587717306463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29559100/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.01.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587717306463,21

This study evaluated the pattern of OAT uptake among PWID in two consecutive national bio-behavioral surveillance surveys (2010 and 2014) in Iran. METHODS: Data were obtained from two national bio-behavioral surveillance surveys (N(2010) = 1783 and N(2014) = 2166) implemented using convenience sampling at the harm reduction facilities and street venues in 10 geographically diverse urban centers across Iran. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to determine the correlates of OAT uptake for the 2014 survey, and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) along with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. RESULTS: The prevalence of OAT uptake decreased from 49.2% in 2010 to 45.8% in 2014 (P value = 0.033). OAT uptake varied across the studied cities ranging from 0.0 to 69.3% in the 2010 survey and 3.2 to 75.5% in the 2014 survey. Ever being married (AOR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.12, 1.75), having a history of incarceration (AOR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.16, 2.09), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sero-positivity (AOR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.08, 2.50) were associated with OAT uptake. Conversely, PWID who reported using only non-opioid drugs (AOR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.26, 0.71) and those who reported concurrent use of opioid and non-opioid drugs (AOR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.51, 0.86) were less likely to uptake OAT. CONCLUSIONS: Although OAT uptake among PWID in Iran is above the 40% threshold defined by the World Health Organization, there remain significant disparities across urban settings in Iran. Importantly, the OAT services appear to be serving high-risk PWID including those living with HIV and those with a history of incarceration. Evaluating service integration including mental health, HIV and hepatitis C virus care, and other harm reduction services may support the optimization of health outcomes associated with OAT across Iran.","Nakhaeizadeh, Mehran; Abdolahinia, Zahra; Sharifi, Hamid; Mirzazadeh, Ali; Haghdoost, Ali Akbar; Shokoohi, Mostafa; Baral, Stefan; Karamouzian, Mohammad; Shahesmaeili, Armita",Harm Reduct J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32698875/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-020-00392-1,21

640576,A great ape perspective on the origins and evolution of human viruses.,2021,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported a negative psychological and mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This impact is likely to be stronger for people with autism as they are at heightened risk of mental health problems and because the pandemic directly affects social functioning and everyday routines. We therefore examined COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in mental health, the impact of the pandemic on their social life and routines, satisfaction with pandemic-related information and tips, and participants’ wishes for guidance. METHODS: We used a mixed-method approach, collecting quantitative and qualitative survey data from adults with and without autism across three European countries: Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK (N = 1044). RESULTS: We found an increase in depression and anxiety symptoms in response to the pandemic for both the non-autism and the autism group, which was greater for adults with autism. Furthermore, adults with autism showed a greater increase in worries about their pets, work, getting medication and food, and their own safety/security. They felt more relieved from social stress, yet experienced the loss of social contact as difficult. Adults with autism also felt more stressed about the loss of routines. Pleasant changes noted by adults with autism were the increase in solidarity and reduced sensory and social overload. Adults with autism frequently reported problems with cancellation of guidance due to the pandemic and expressed their wish for (more) autism-specific information and advice. LIMITATIONS: Our sample is likely to reflect some degree of selection bias, and longitudinal studies are needed to determine long-term effects. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the psychological burden of the pandemic on adults with autism and shed light on how to support them during this COVID-19 pandemic, which is especially important now that the pandemic is likely to have a prolonged course. There is a need for accessible, affordable (continued) support from health services. Guidance may focus on the maintenance of a social network, and adjusting routines to the rapid ongoing changes. Finally, we may learn from the COVID-19 pandemic-related changes experienced as pleasant by adults with autism to build a more autism-friendly society post-pandemic.","Oomen, Danna; Nijhof, Annabel D.; Wiersema, Jan R.",Mol Autism,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13229-021-00424-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33658046/,21

Analysis of the data from 251 employees in Taiwan revealed two significant three-way interactive effects. Specifically, for men, the positive relationship between work demands and family-to-work conflict (FWC) was stronger for egalitarian than traditional individuals. For women, the positive relationship between family demands and FWC was stronger for egalitarian than traditional individuals. We also found a significant two-way interactive effect; that is, within the egalitarian group, the positive relationship between work demands and FWC was stronger for women than men. Our findings, thus, suggest both within-gender and between-gender variations in the links between work-to-family demands and conflict, jointly affected by the individual’s gender and gender role orientation. Contextualized within the cultural traditions of a Chinese society, we highlight the precarious position that egalitarian men and women (especially women) find for themselves in fulfilling work duties and family roles.

We examined the relationship between blood group and clinical outcomes in individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and compared their blood group distribution with the general population. METHODS: At the inception of the pandemic, all individuals testing positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 in Kuwait were admitted to one designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) hospital and enrolled in a prospective registry. Patients admitted from February 24 to May 27, 2020, were stratified according to blood group. As a control, blood groups of 3,730,027 anonymized individuals representing almost Kuwait's entire population were obtained from a national database. RESULTS: Of 3305 SARS‐CoV‐2–positive patients, 37.1%, 25.5%, 28.9%, and 8.5% were groups O, A, B, and AB, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed no significant differences in severe clinical outcomes or death among the blood groups. However, multivariable analysis demonstrated that group A individuals had higher odds of developing pneumonia compared with non–group A (adjusted odds ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.02–1.72, p < .036). Compared with the general population, the COVID‐19 cohort had a lower frequency of group O, equivalent frequency of A, and higher frequency of B and AB. No significant difference in the RhD group was found. CONCLUSION: This study supports potential involvement of the ABO blood group system in predisposing to infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 in an unselected population.

Methods We used population-level questionnaire data from a social networking service (SNS) with 275,560 respondents from March 5 to April 6 to evaluate the relationship between telework implementation and the presence of a fever (body temperature above 37.5°C) within one month as a surrogate indicator of COVID-19 infection, by occupation type and age group. Results Among company employees, a statistical significance was identified in the 15–29 and 30–59 age groups, showing higher fever rates in the non-teleworker group (for 15–29 age group, non-teleworkers: 7.64%; teleworkers: 6.45%; p=0.02; for 30–59 age group, non-teleworkers: 3.46%; teleworkers: 3.14%; p=0.02). Conclusions Telework remains a controversial topic in Japan as the government called for emergency measures. While caution is warranted in interpreting our findings because our data is limited to the voluntary SNS users, they will be essential to push forward with more measures to promote social distancing measures in the midst of Japan's current tense political climate.","Kawashima, Takayuki; Nomura, Shuhei; Tanoue, Yuta; Yoneoka, Daisuke; Eguchi, Akifumi; Shi, Shoi; Miyata, Hiroaki",Public Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350620301803?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33607515/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350620301803; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.05.018,21

This chapter discusses the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatments of KD. The etiology still remains unknown, although epidemiological and clinical features strongly suggest an infectious cause. Immunological abnormalities in the acute phase of the disease reflect activation of immune system and marked production of cytokines by activated cells. KD has some similarities to toxin-mediated diseases, both from a clinical and an immunological point of view. The role of one or more superantigens competent of stimulating large numbers of T cells produced by certain strains of Staphylococcus or Streptococcus is discussed in the chapter, in the context of the etiology of KD. Atypical cases are those with fever, acute surgical symptoms, or neurological manifestations as presenting signs. Medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests including elevated white-blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and low hemoglobin, sodium and albumin levels may help to rule out illnesses mimicking KD.

642146,Yeast surface display for protein engineering and characterization,2007-08-01,"BACKGROUND: Atractylodes lancea (Thunb.) DC, a medicinal herb belonging to the Asteraceae family, often faces severe drought stress during its growth. Until now, there has been no research on the effect of drought stress on the quality formation of A. lancea. Therefore, the present study aimed to study the effects of drought stress on A. lancea through physical and chemical analysis, and to reveal the related molecular mechanisms via transcriptome analysis. RESULTS: The photosynthesis was markedly inhibited under drought stress. There were alterations to photosynthetic parameters (Pn, Gs, Ci) and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm, NPQ), and the chlorophyll content decreased. Twenty genes encoding important regulatory enzymes in light and dark reactions, including the Rubisco gene of the Calvin cycle, were significantly downregulated. After exposure to drought stress for more than 4 days, the activities of four antioxidative enzymes (SOD, POD CAT and APX) began to decrease and continued to decrease with longer stress exposure. Meanwhile, most of the genes encoding antioxidative enzymes were downregulated significantly. The downregulation of 21 genes related to the respiratory electron transport chain indicated that the blocked electron transfer accelerated excessive ROS. The MDA content was significantly elevated. The above data showed that 15 days of drought stress caused serious oxidative damage to A. lancea. Drought stress not only reduced the size and dry weight of A. lancea, but also lowered the amount of total volatile oil and the content of the main bioactive components. The total volatile oil and atractylodin content decreased slightly, whereas the content of atractylon and β-eudesmol decreased significantly. Moreover, ten significantly downregulated genes encoding sesquiterpene synthase were mainly expressed in rhizomes. CONCLUSIONS: After exposed to drought stress, the process of assimilation was affected by the destruction of photosynthesis; stress tolerance was impaired because of the inhibition of the antioxidative enzyme system; and bioactive component biosynthesis was hindered by the downregulation of sesquiterpene synthase-related gene expression.

Through the replacement of arginine by the less basic canavanine, new inhibitors targeting furin in the trans-Golgi network were developed. These inhibitors exert potent antiviral activity in cell culture with much lower toxicity than arginine-derived analogues, most likely due to their reduced protonation in the blood circulation. Thus, despite its important physiological functions, furin might be a suitable antiviral drug target.","Lam van, Thuy Van; Heindl, Miriam Ruth; Schlutt, Christine; Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, Eva; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Klebe, Gerhard; Brandstetter, Hans; Dahms, Sven O.; Steinmetzer, Torsten",ACS Med Chem Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33732412/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmedchemlett.0c00651,21

By analysing the transmission dynamics during the first wave of COVID-19 in the country, the effectiveness of the various levels of control actions taken to flatten the curve can be better quantified and understood. This in turn can help the relevant authorities to better plan for and control the subsequent waves of the pandemic. To achieve this, a deterministic population model for the pandemic is firstly developed to take into consideration the time-dependent characteristics of the model parameters, especially on the ever-evolving value of the reproduction number, which is one of the critical measures used to describe the transmission dynamics of this pandemic. The reproduction number alongside other key parameters of the model can then be estimated by fitting the model to real-world data using numerical optimisation techniques or by inducing ad-hoc control actions as recorded in the news platforms. In this article, the model is verified using a case study based on the data from the first wave of COVID-19 in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The model is fitted to provide estimates for two settings in simulations; time-invariant and time-varying (with bounded constraints) parameters. Finally, some forecasts are made using four scenarios with time-dependent control measures so as to determine which would reflect on the actual situations better.","Do, Ton Duc; Gui, Meei Mei; Ng, Kok Yew",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33604187/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10806,21
643954,Targeting the SphK-S1P-SIPR Pathway as a Potential Therapeutic Approach for COVID-19,2020-09-29,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV2 is a rapidly spreading global pandemic. Although precise transmission routes and dynamics are unknown, SARS-CoV2 is thought primarily to spread via contagious respiratory droplets. Unlike with SARS-CoV, maximal viral shedding occurs in the early phase of illness, and this is supported by models that suggest 40-80% of transmission events occur from pre- and asymptomatic individuals. One widely-discussed strategy to limit transmission of SARS-CoV2, particularly from presymptomatic individuals, has been population-level wearing of masks. Modelling for pandemic influenza suggests some benefit in reducing total numbers infected with even 50% mask-use. COVID-19 has a higher hospitalization and mortality rate than influenza, and the impacts on these parameters, and critically, at what point in the pandemic trajectory mask-use might exert maximal benefit are completely unknown. We derived a simplified SIR model to investigate the effects of near-universal mask-use on COVID-19 assuming 8 or 16% mask efficacy. We decided to model, in particular, the impact of masks on numbers of critically-ill patients and cumulative mortality, since these are parameters that are likely to have the most severe consequences in the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas mask use had a relatively minor benefit on critical-care and mortality rates when transmissibility (Reff) was high, the reduction on deaths was dramatic as the effective R approached 1, as might be expected after aggressive social-distancing measures such as wide-spread lockdowns. One major concern with COVID-19 is its potential to overwhelm healthcare infrastructures, even in resource-rich settings, with one third of hospitalized patients requiring critical-care. We incorporated this into our model, increasing death rates for when critical-care resources have been exhausted. Our simple model shows that modest efficacy of masks could avert substantial mortality in this scenario. Importantly, the effects on mortality became hyper-sensitive to mask-wearing as the effective R approaches 1, i.e. near the tipping point of when the infection trajectory is expected to revert to exponential growth, as would be expected after effective lockdown. Our model suggests that mask-wearing might exert maximal benefit as nations plan their post-lockdown strategies and suggests that mask-wearing should be included in further more sophisticated models of the current pandemic.","Javid, Babak; Balaban, Nathalie Q",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063529,21
644076,Inhibition of Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney cell proliferation by X-ray-induced senescence,2021-03-17,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in lung transplant recipients (LTRs) have been associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Immunoglobulins, ribavirin, and palivizumab are suggested treatments for both pre-emptive and therapeutic purposes. However, in the absence of randomized, placebo-controlled trials, efficacy is controversial and there is toxicity as well as cost concerns. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cases of lower respiratory tract RSV infections in adult LTRs. Diagnosis was based on clinical history, combined with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or viral cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens. RESULTS: Ten symptomatic patients were identified (7 men and 3 women, age range 28 to 64 years). All were hospitalized for community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Two patients had a concomitant acute Grade A3 graft rejection, and 1 patient had a concomitant bacterial pneumonia. Eight patients did not receive a specific anti-RSV treatment because of clinical stability and/or improvement at the time of RSV diagnosis. Only 2 patients (1 with Grade A3 allograft rejection and 1 requiring mechanical ventilation) received ribavirin and palivizumab. All patients recovered without complications and with no persistent RSV infection. However, bronchiolitis obliterans (BOS) staging worsened in 6 patients during the mean follow-up of 45 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that mild RSV infections in LTRs might evolve favorably in the absence of specific anti-viral therapy. However, this observation needs confirmation in a large clinical trial specifically investigating the development of BOS in untreated vs treated patients.","Uçkay, Ilker; Gasche-Soccal, Paola M.; Kaiser, Laurent; Stern, Richard; Mazza-Stalder, Jesica; Aubert, John-David; van Delden, Christian",J Heart Lung Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2009.08.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19837611/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053249809006391; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053249809006391,21

This viral infection causes acute diarrhea leading to death. Rapid identification of infected calves is essential to control BRV successfully. Therefore development of simple, highly specific, and sensitive detection method for BRV is needed. RESULTS: A reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed and optimized for rapid detection of BRV. Specific primer sets were designed to target the sequences of the VP6 gene of the neonatal calf diarrhea virus (NCDV) strain of BRV. The RT-LAMP assay was performed in a water bath for 60 minutes at 63°C, and the amplification products were visualized either directly or under ultraviolet light. This BRV specific RT-LAMP assay could detect 3.32 copies of subtype A BRV. No cross-reactions were detected with other bovine pathogens. The ability of RT-LAMP to detect bovine rotavirus was further evaluated with 88 bovine rectal swab samples. Twenty-nine of these samples were found to be positive for BRV using RT-LAMP. The BRV-specific-RT-LAMP results were also confirmed by real-time RT-PCR assay. CONCLUSIONS: The bovine rotavirus-specific RT-LAMP assay was highly sensitive and holds promise as a prompt and simple diagnostic method for the detection of group A bovine rotavirus infection in young calves.","Xie, Zhixun; Fan, Qing; Liu, Jiabo; Pang, Yaoshan; Deng, Xianwen; Xie, Zhiqin; Liji, Xie; Khan, Mazhar I",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22894568/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-133,21

Marine resources are not explored much and to be taken into consideration for exploring antiviral potential. Chitosan (carbohydrate polymer) is one such bioactive glycan found ubiquitously in marine organisms. The presence of reactive amine/hydroxyl groups, with low toxicity/allergenicity, compels us to explore it against SARS-CoV-2. We have screened a library of chitosan derivatives by site-specific docking at not only spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of wild type SARS-CoV-2 but also on RBD of B.1.1.7 (UK) and P.1 (Brazil) SARS-CoV-2 variants. The obtained result was very interesting and ranks N-benzyl-O-acetyl-chitosan, Imino-chitosan, Sulfated-chitosan oligosaccharides derivatives as a potent antiviral candidate due to its high binding affinity of the ligands (-6.0 to -6.6 kcal/mol) with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD and they critically interacting with amino acid residues Tyr 449, Asn 501, Tyr 501, Gln 493, Gln 498 and some other site-specific residues associated with higher transmissibility and severe infection. Further ADMET analysis was done and found significant for exploration of the future therapeutic potential of these three ligands.

Testing enables quick identification of cases, which results in effective contact tracing and containment of virus spread. Faced with a lack of surge capacity in the public health laboratory system at the start, health officials implemented changes to testing and laboratory infrastructure to significantly expand testing capacity to include 1) the centralization of resources; and 2) the integration of private and independent labs into the COVID-19 testing program. With these changes, testing capacity has grown from approximately 4 000/day in March to 32 000/day by the end of August, 2020. Eligibility criteria for testing has expanded to increase sensitivity and include testing of asymptomatic individuals. Along with previous outbreaks, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for integration of testing surge capacity in public health systems before outbreaks occur.

However, the definition of well-being and the evidence base behind such guidelines remain unclear. AIMS: The aims of the study are to assess the applicability of well-being guidelines in practice, identify unaddressed healthcare workers’ needs and provide recommendations for supporting front-line staff during the current and future pandemics. METHOD: This paper discusses the findings of a qualitative study based on interviews with front-line healthcare workers in the UK (n = 33), and examines them in relation to a rapid review of well-being guidelines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 14). RESULTS: The guidelines placed greater emphasis on individual mental health and psychological support, whereas healthcare workers placed greater emphasis on structural conditions at work, responsibilities outside the hospital and the invaluable support of the community. The well-being support interventions proposed in the guidelines did not always respond to the lived experiences of staff, as some reported not being able to participate in these interventions because of understaffing, exhaustion or clashing schedules. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers expressed well-being needs that aligned with socio-ecological conceptualisations of well-being related to quality of life. This approach to well-being has been highlighted in literature on support of healthcare workers in previous health emergencies, but it has not been monitored during this pandemic. Well-being guidelines should explore the needs of healthcare workers, and contextual characteristics affecting the implementation of recommendations.","Vera San Juan, Norha; Aceituno, David; Djellouli, Nehla; Sumray, Kirsi; Regenold, Nina; Syversen, Aron; Mulcahy Symmons, Sophie; Dowrick, Anna; Mitchinson, Lucy; Singleton, Georgina; Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia",BJPsych Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33298229/; https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.148,21

The protein is expensive, requires a cold chain, and is difficult to deploy in limited-resource, high-incidence settings. We generated preclinical proof of concept (PoC) for a dry powder inhalation (DPI) containing DNA constructs to transiently transfect the lung and airway epithelium of mice with murine IFN-γ. Bacterial colony forming units (CFU) in the lungs of mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) reduced from about 106/g of tissue to ∼104 after four doses given once a week. Nodular inflammatory lesions in the lungs reduced significantly in number. Immunohistochemistry of infected lung sections for LC3-1 and LAMP-1 indicated autophagy induction between 18-48h after inhalation. ELISA on bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid showed differences in kinetics of IFN-γ concentrations in the epithelial lining fluid of healthy versus infected mice. Uninfected mice receiving DNA constructs expressing a fluorescent protein were live-imaged. The fluorescence signals from the intracellular protein peaked at about 36h after inhalation and declined by 48h. These results establish preclinical PoC of the efficacy of a DPI and dosing regimen as host-directed and transient gene therapy of experimental pulmonary TB in mice, justifying preclinical development.","Bharti, Reena; Srivastava, Ashish; Roy, Trisha; Verma, Khushboo; Reddy, DV Siva; Shafi, Hasham; Verma, Sonia; Raman, Sunil K.; Singh, Amit K.; Singh, Jyotsna; Ray, Lipika; Misra, Amit",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2162253120303358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33110704/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2020.10.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2162253120303358?v=s5,21

646170,Phylogeny of Viruses,2008-07-30,"In many single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses, the cis-acting packaging signal that confers selectivity genome packaging usually encompasses short structured RNA repeats. These structural units, termed repetitive structural motifs (RSMs), potentially mediate capsid assembly by specific RNA–protein interactions. However, general knowledge of the conservation and/or the diversity of RSMs in the positive-sense ssRNA coronaviruses (CoVs) is limited. By performing structural phylogenetic analysis, we identified a variety of RSMs in nearly all CoV genomic RNAs, which are exclusively located in the 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs) and/or in the inter-domain regions of poly-protein 1ab coding sequences in a lineage-specific manner. In all alpha- and beta-CoVs, except for Embecovirus spp, two to four copies of 5′-gUUYCGUc-3′ RSMs displaying conserved hexa-loop sequences were generally identified in Stem-loop 5 (SL5) located in the 5′-UTRs of genomic RNAs. In Embecovirus spp., however, two to eight copies of 5′-agc-3′/guAAu RSMs were found in the coding regions of non-structural protein (NSP) 3 and/or NSP15 in open reading frame (ORF) 1ab. In gamma- and delta-CoVs, other types of RSMs were found in several clustered structural elements in 5′-UTRs and/or ORF1ab. The identification of RSM-encompassing structural elements in all CoVs suggests that these RNA elements play fundamental roles in the life cycle of CoVs. In the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2, beta-CoV-specific RSMs are also found in its SL5, displaying two copies of 5′-gUUUCGUc-3′ motifs. However, multiple sequence alignment reveals that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 possesses a variant RSM harboring SL5b C241U, and intriguingly, several variations in the coding sequences of viral proteins, such as Nsp12 P323L, S protein D614G, and N protein R203K-G204R, are concurrently found with such variant RSM. In conclusion, the comprehensive exploration for RSMs reveals phylogenetic insights into the RNA structural elements in CoVs as a whole and provides a new perspective on variations currently found in SARS-CoV-2.","Chen, Shih-Cheng; Olsthoorn, René C L; Yu, Chien-Hung",Virus Evol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veab021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34141447/,21

Here, we describe a case of a patient with COVID-19 who developed transient complete atrioventricular (AV) block and bradycardia after initiating treatment with Remdesivir. CASE SUMMARY: A 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and lung cancer was hospitalized for COVID-19. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission demonstrated atrial fibrillation and right bundle branch block. He was started on a course of Dexamethasone and Remdesivir. Within 24 h of starting Remdesivir, he was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates between 30 and 40 b.p.m. On Day 5 of Remdesivir therapy, ECG demonstrated complete AV block. Having completed the Remdesivir regimen, during the next 48 h, he was closely monitored, and the AV block resolved spontaneously. As he remained asymptomatic and had an adequate chronotropic response with activity, pacemaker implantation was not recommended. DISCUSSION: Despite the widespread use of Remdesivir, there is little known information about its cardiac toxicity. Daily ECGs and close cardiac surveillance of patients who develop severe bradycardia or AV block are essential.

Our analyses involving molecular phylogenetics is a step toward understanding the transmission clusters that can be correlated to pathophysiology of the disease to gain insight into virulence mechanism. As the infections are increasing rapidly, more divergence is expected followed possibly by viral adaptation. We could identify mutational hotspots which appear to be major drivers of diversity among strains, with RBD of spike protein emerging as the key region involved in interaction with ACE2 and consequently a major determinant of infection outcome.

To support this search, computational models are used to predict the spread of the virus and to assess the efficacy of policy measures before actual implementation. The model output has to be interpreted carefully though, as computational models are subject to uncertainties. These can stem from, e.g., limited knowledge about input parameters values or from the intrinsic stochastic nature of some computational models. They lead to uncertainties in the model predictions, raising the question what distribution of values the model produces for key indicators of the severity of the epidemic. Here we show how to tackle this question using techniques for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. We assess the uncertainties and sensitivities of four exit strategies implemented in an agent-based transmission model with geographical stratification. The exit strategies are termed Flattening the Curve, Contact Tracing, Intermittent Lockdown and Phased Opening. We consider two key indicators of the ability of exit strategies to avoid catastrophic health care overload: the maximum number of prevalent cases in intensive care (IC), and the total number of IC patient-days in excess of IC bed capacity. Our results show that uncertainties not directly related to the exit strategies are secondary, although they should still be considered in comprehensive analysis intended to inform policy makers. The sensitivity analysis discloses the crucial role of the intervention uptake by the population and of the capability to trace infected individuals. Finally, we explore the existence of a safe operating space. For Intermittent Lockdown we find only a small region in the model parameter space where the key indicators of the model stay within safe bounds, whereas this region is larger for the other exit strategies.","Gugole, Federica; Coffeng, Luc E.; Edeling, Wouter; Sanderse, Benjamin; de Vlas, Sake J.; Crommelin, Daan",PLoS Comput Biol,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34534205/,21

648119,An Accessible Alternative to Melarsomine: “Moxi-Doxy” for Treatment of Adult Heartworm Infection in Dogs,2021-07-27,"Since the reform and opening up of China, the economy has continued to grow, and diverse needs have generated different types and periods of economic activities. This has caused people to have an unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, irregular work and rest, lack of sleep, mental stress, high psychological pressure, long-term bad moods, and other health problems. The proportion of the sub-healthy population continues to increase and health problems are becoming increasingly prominent. Based on this, we examine the internal mechanism of the economic cycle on national health since the reform and opening up of China. For a long time, China has actively responded to the UN's call for environmental protection and proposed that “clear waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets.” Therefore, this study combines air quality in the process of environmental governance in China to investigate national health. Data from 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, and four municipalities from 2004 to 2017 are selected as research samples to examine the relationship between economic cycles, air quality, and national health for empirical testing. Studies have shown that the economic cycle is significantly correlated with national health.

648620,Updates on Rabies virus disease: is evolution toward “Zombie virus” a tangible threat?,2021-02-04,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a surge in the use of virtual communication tools for delivering clinical services for many non-urgent medical needs allowing telehealth or telemedicine, to become an almost inevitable part of the patient care. However, most of patients with vascular disease may require face-to-face interaction and are at risk of worse outcomes if not managed in timely manner. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the utilization of telemedicine services in the outpatient vascular surgery clinics in a tertiary hospital. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data on all vascular outpatient encounters during 2019 and 2020 was conducted and compared to reflect the pattern of practice prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The study showed that 61% of the total patient encounters in 2020 were reported through teleconsultation. Females were the majority of patients who sought the virtual vascular care. Consultations for the new cases decreased from 29% to 26% whereas, the follow-up cases increased from 71% to 74% in 2020 (p = 0.001). The number of procedures performed in the vascular outpatient clinics decreased by 46% in 2020 when compared to 2019. This decrease in procedures was more evident in the duration from February 2020 to April 2020 in which the procedures decreased by 97%. The proportion of procedures represented 22.6% of the total encounters in 2019 and 10.5% of the encounters during 2020, (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Teleconsultation, along with supporting practice guidelines, can be used to maximize the efficiency of care in vascular surgery patients during the pandemic and beyond. Adoption of the ‘hybrid care’ which combines both virtual and in-person services as an ongoing practice requires evidence obtained through audits and studies on patients and healthcare providers levels. It is essential to establish a clear practice that ensures patient’s needs.","Al-Thani, Hassan; Mekkodathil, Ahammed; Hussain, Ahmed; Sharaf, Ahmed; Sadek, Ahmed; Aldakhl-Allah, Anas; Awad, Ahmed; Al-Abdullah, Nassar; Zitoun, Ahmad; Paul, Jini; Pillai, Pushpalatha; John, Sara; El-Menyar, Ayman",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34591886/,21
648680,Viruses and Evolution – Viruses First? A Personal Perspective,2019-03-19,"Due to its excessively high capacity for human-to-human transmission, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first reported in Wuhan in China, spread rapidly to the entire nation and beyond, and has now been declared a global public health emergency. Understanding the transmission pattern of the virus and the efficacy of transmission control measures is crucial to ensuring regional and global disease control. Here we propose a simple model based on exponential infectious growth, but with a time-varying, largely damping, transmission rate. This model provides an excellent fit to the existing data from the 102 countries and regions which have reported cases for more than 6 days, and, we think, has largely captured the transmission patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak under a variety of intervention and control measures. We found that the damping rate, defined as the rate of the exponential decline in transmission rate, ranged from -0.125 to 0.513 d-1 globally (a negative damping rate represents acceleration in spread). The estimated peak time (when the fastest spread occurs) and the final number of infections were found to be greatly affected by the damping rate. Successful control measures, such as those implemented in China and South Korea, have resulted in a clear pattern of exponential damping in the viral spread (also shown during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS). The damping rate, therefore, could be used as an indicator for the efficacy of implemented control measures. Our model suggests that the COVID-19 outbreak is currently accelerating worldwide, especially rapidly in certain countries (e.g. USA and Australia) where exponential damping is yet to emerge. Consistent with the message from the World Health Organisation (WHO), we thus strongly suggest all countries to take active measures to contain this global pandemic. Slight increments in the damping rate from additional control efforts, especially in countries showing weak or no exponential damping in COVID-19 transmission, could lead to a radically more positive outcome in the fight to contain the pandemic.","Zhang, Feng; Zhang, Jinmei; Cao, Menglan; Zhang, Yong; Hui, Cang",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041111,21

Large-scale testing is limited by the need for in-person blood collection by staff trained in venepuncture. Capillary blood self-sampling and postage to laboratories for analysis could provide a reliable alternative. Two-hundred and nine matched venous and capillary blood samples were obtained from thirty nine participants and analysed using a COVID-19 IgG ELISA to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Thirty seven out of thirty eight participants were able to self-collect an adequate sample of capillary blood ([≥]50 l). Using plasma from venous blood collected in lithium heparin as the reference standard, matched capillary blood samples, collected in lithium heparin-treated tubes and on filter paper as dried blood spots, achieved a Cohen's kappa coefficient of >0.88 (near-perfect agreement). Storage of capillary blood at room temperature for up to 7 days post sampling did not affect concordance.

The diagnostic test sensitivity of COVID-19 is limited due to irregularities in specimen handling. We propose a deep learning framework that identifies COVID-19 from medical images as an auxiliary testing method to improve diagnostic sensitivity. We use pseudo-coloring methods and a platform for annotating X-ray and computed tomography images to train the convolutional neural network, which achieves a performance similar to that of experts and provides high scores for multiple statistical indices (F1 scores > 96.72% (0.9307, 0.9890) and specificity >99.33% (0.9792, 1.0000)). Heatmaps are used to visualize the salient features extracted by the neural network. The neural network-based regression provides strong correlations between the lesion areas in the images and five clinical indicators, resulting in high accuracy of the classification framework.

To further our understanding of this critical and worldwide issue, we conducted a systematic review to understand whether, and how, PLACI access and use essential formal supports and services. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched 6 databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Sociological Abstracts) to identify quantitative and mixed-method literature on formal service use among PLACI. The initial search was conducted in 2018 and updated in 2020. RESULTS: We identified 32 studies published between 1992 and 2019, representing 13 countries, that met our criteria: 16 reported on health services and 26 on social services. Most studies compared PLACI with people with cognitive impairment living with others. Health service use was lower or similar among PLACI, as opposed to counterparts living with others. Most studies reported a higher use of social services (e.g., home services) among PLACI than those living with others. Overall use of essential home service among PLACI was higher in Europe than in the United States, a country where large portions of PLACI were reported receiving no formal services. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: We identified wide variability among countries and major gaps in service use. Results for use of health services were mixed, although our findings suggest that PLACI may have fewer physician visits than counterparts living with others. Our findings suggest that varying policies and budgets for these services among countries may have affected our findings. We encourage researchers to evaluate and compare the influence of social policies in the well-being of PLACI. We also encourage policy makers to prioritize the needs of PLACI in national dementia strategies.","Rosenwohl-Mack, Amy; Dubbin, Leslie; Chodos, Anna; Dulaney, Sarah; Fang, Min-Lin; Merrilees, Jennifer; Portacolone, Elena",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796795/; https://doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igab004,21
650291,Ribavirin: a drug active against many viruses with multiple effects on virus replication and propagation. Molecular basis of ribavirin resistance,2014-05-19,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been the focus of redox research in the realm of oxidative neonatal respiratory diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Over the years, nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) have been identified as important gaseous signaling molecules involved in modulating the redox homeostasis in the developing lung. While animal data targeting aspects of these redox pathways have been promising in treating and/or preventing experimental models of neonatal lung disease, none are particularly effective in human neonatal clinical trials. In recent years, hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has emerged as a novel gasotransmitter involved in a magnitude of cellular signaling pathways and functions. The importance of H(2)S signaling may lie in the fact that early life-forms evolved in a nearly anoxic, sulfur-rich environment and were dependent on H(2)S for energy. Recent studies have demonstrated an important role of H(2)S and its synthesizing enzymes in lung development, which normally takes place in a relatively hypoxic intrauterine environment. In this review, we look at clues from evolution and explore the important role that the H(2)S signaling pathway may play in oxidative neonatal respiratory diseases and discuss future opportunities to explore this phenomenon in the context of neonatal chronic lung disease.","Ganguly, Abhrajit; Ofman, Gaston; Vitiello, Peter F",Children (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33799529/; https://doi.org/10.3390/children8030213,21

652303,Isolation and Characterization of a Novel Gammaherpesvirus from a Microbat Cell Line,2016-02-17,"BACKGROUND: Ebolaviruses induce lethal viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) in humans and non-human primates, with the exceptions of Reston virus (RESTV), which is not pathogenic for humans. In human VHF cases, extensive analyses of the humoral immune responses in survivors and non-survivors have shown that the IgG responses to nucleoprotein (NP) and other viral proteins are associated with asymptomatic and survival outcomes, and that the neutralizing antibody responses targeting ebolaviruses glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) are the major indicator of protective immunity. On the other hand, the immune responses in non-human primates, especially naturally infected ones, have not yet been elucidated in detail, and the significance of the antibody responses against NP and GP(1,2) in RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the humoral immune responses of cynomolgus macaque by using serum specimens obtained from the RESTV epizootic in 1996 in the Philippines to expand our knowledge on the immune responses in naturally RESTV-infected non-human primates. RESULTS: The antibody responses were analyzed using IgG-ELISA, an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA), and a pseudotyped VSV-based neutralizing (NT) assay. Antigen-capture (Ag)-ELISA was also performed to detect viral antigens in the serum specimens. We found that the anti-GP(1,2) responses, but not the anti-NP responses, closely were correlated with the neutralization responses, as well as the clearance of viremia in the sera of the RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques. Additionally, by analyzing the cytokine/chemokine concentrations of these serum specimens, we found high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as IFNγ, IL8, IL-12, and MIP1α, in the convalescent phase sera. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that both the antibody response to GP(1,2) and the proinflammatory innate responses play significant roles in the recovery from RESTV infection in cynomolgus macaques.","Taniguchi, Satoshi; Sayama, Yusuke; Nagata, Noriyo; Ikegami, Tetsuro; Miranda, Mary E; Watanabe, Shumpei; Iizuka, Itoe; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Ishii, Yoshiyuki; Saijo, Masayuki; Akashi, Hiroomi; Yoshikawa, Yasuhiro; Kyuwa, Shigeru; Morikawa, Shigeru",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23057674/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-189,21
652569,Zinc-Embedded Polyamide Fabrics Inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A Virus,2021-06-27,"Several genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens have been conducted to identify host factors regulating SARS-CoV-2 replication, but the models used have often relied on overexpression of ACE2 receptor. Additionally, such screens have yet to identify the protease TMPRSS2, known to be important for viral entry at the plasma membrane. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of these screens and showed a high level of cell-type specificity of the identified hits, arguing for the necessity of additional models to uncover the full landscape of SARS-CoV-2 host factors. We performed genome-wide knockout and activation CRISPR screens in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, as well as knockout screens in Caco-2 intestinal cells. In addition to identifying ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as top hits, our study reveals a series of so far unidentified and critical host-dependency factors, including the Adaptins AP1G1 and AP1B1 and the flippase ATP8B1. Moreover, new anti-SARS-CoV-2 proteins with potent activity, including several membrane-associated Mucins, IL6R, and CD44 were identified. We further observed that these genes mostly acted at the critical step of viral entry, with the notable exception of ATP8B1, the knockout of which prevented late stages of viral replication. Exploring the pro- and anti-viral breadth of these genes using highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, seasonal HCoV-NL63 and -229E and influenza A orthomyxovirus, we reveal that some genes such as AP1G1 and ATP8B1 are general coronavirus cofactors. In contrast, Mucins recapitulated their known role as a general antiviral defense mechanism. These results demonstrate the value of considering multiple cell models and perturbational modalities for understanding SARS-CoV-2 replication and provide a list of potential new targets for therapeutic interventions.","Rebendenne, Antoine; Roy, Priyanka; Bonaventure, Boris; Chaves Valadão, Ana Luiza; Desmarets, Lowiese; Rouillé, Yves; Tauziet, Marine; Arnaud-Arnould, Mary; Giovannini, Donatella; Lee, Yenarae; DeWeirdt, Peter; Hegde, Mudra; Garcia de Gracia, Francisco; McKellar, Joe; Wencker, Mélanie; Dubuisson, Jean; Belouzard, Sandrine; Moncorgé, Olivier; Doench, John G.; Goujon, Caroline",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34031654/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.19.444823,21

METHODS: Data were gathered through an online survey distributed via snowball sampling in July 2020. The survey included an open‐ended question asking nurses to describe a personal experience providing care to a COVID‐19 patient. Researchers analyzed 118 responses using content analysis. RESULTS: The experience of nurses providing care to patients with COVID‐19 was summarized into six themes: (1) feeling overwhelmed with the quantity of work (33.1%), (2) patient death (30.5%), (3) helplessness (23.7%), (4) absence of patient family presence and need for additional support (22.9%), (5) personal protective equipment (PPE) concerns regarding safety and how PPE can impair the nursing role (20.3%), and (6) lack of preparedness for the pandemic (16.9%).

RESULTS: A framework integrating complexity and scaling up processes was used to conceptually orient the study. Findings are presented by case in four domains: value proposition, actors, technology and organisational context. The scale and use of PPIP and Child PIP were driven by ‘champions’; clinicians who developed technically simple tools to digitise clinical audit data. Top-down political will at the national level drove the scaling of MomConnect, supported by ongoing financial and technical support from donors and technical partners. Donor preferences played a significant role in the selection of CommCare as the platform to digitise community health worker service information, with a focus on HIV and TB. A key driver of scale across cases is leadership that recognises and advocates for the value of the digital health solution. The technology need not be complex but must navigate the complexity of operating within an overburdened and fragmented South African health system. Inadequate and unsustained investment from donors and government, particularly in human resource capacity and robust monitioring and evaluation, continue to threaten the sustainability of digital health solutions. CONCLUSIONS: There is no single pathway to achieving scale up or sustainability, and there will be successes and challenges regardless of the configuration of the domains of value proposition, technology, actors and organisational context. While scaling and sustaining digital solutions has its technological challenges, perhaps more complex are the idiosyncratic factors and nature of the relationships between actors involved. Scaling up and sustaining digital solutions need to account for the interplay of the various technical and social dimensions involved in supporting digital solutions to succeed, particularly in health systems that are themselves social and political dynamic systems.","Swartz, Alison; LeFevre, Amnesty E.; Perera, Shehani; Kinney, Mary V.; George, Asha S.",Global Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00716-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34229699/,21

Despite the efforts, so far no vaccine or drug has been approved for treatment. Artificial intelligence offers solutions that could accelerate the discovery and optimization of new antivirals, especially in the current scenario dominated by the scarcity of compounds active against SARS-CoV-2. The main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 is an attractive target for drug discovery due to the absence in humans and the essential role in viral replication. In this work, we developed a deep learning platform for de novo design of putative inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)). Our methodology consists of 3 main steps: (1) training and validation of general chemistry-based generative model; (2) fine-tuning of the generative model for the chemical space of SARS-CoV- M(pro) inhibitors and (3) training of a classifier for bioactivity prediction using transfer learning. The fine-tuned chemical model generated > 90% valid, diverse and novel (not present on the training set) structures. The generated molecules showed a good overlap with M(pro) chemical space, displaying similar physicochemical properties and chemical structures. In addition, novel scaffolds were also generated, showing the potential to explore new chemical series. The classification model outperformed the baseline area under the precision-recall curve, showing it can be used for prediction. In addition, the model also outperformed the freely available model Chemprop on an external test set of fragments screened against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, showing its potential to identify putative antivirals to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a previous study, we analyzed the potentiality of a number of distributions to describe the evolution of the pandemic and the potentiality of each distribution to mathematically predict the evolution of the pandemic in Italy. Since the number of daily tests was changing and increasing with time, we used the ratio of the new daily cases per swab. We considered distributions of the type of Gauss (normal), Gamma, Beta, Weibull, Lognormal and in addition of the type of the Planck blackbody radiation law. The Planck law, describing the amount of energy of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body at each wavelength or at each frequency, marked in 1900 the beginning of Quantum Mechanics. The result of our analysis was that, among the considered distributions, the Planck law has the best potentiality to mathematically predict the evolution of the pandemic and the best fitting capability. In this paper, we analyze the time evolution of this second wave of Covid-19 pandemic in Italy. In this study there is also an attempt to account for the effects of the governmental containment measures.","Ciufolini, I.; Paolozzi, A.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.24.20238139; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.24.20238139v1?rss=1,21
657144,Feline Virome—A Review of Novel Enteric Viruses Detected in Cats,2019-09-30,"Abstract Antibodies to a transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-related coronavirus have been demonstrated in mink sera by indirect immunofluorescence, peroxidase-linked antibody assays and immunoblotting. This is the first serological evidence of a specific coronavirus infection in mink. The putative mink coronavirus (MCV) seems to be widespread in the Danish mink population with a prevalence approaching 100%. Analysis by immunoblotting has shown that MCV is closely related to TGEV by the spike (S), matrix (M) and nucleoprotein (N) polypeptides. Furthermore, antibodies to MCV also cross-reacted with N and M polypeptides of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Thus MCV may occupy an intermediate position between the TGEV group of coronaviruses and PEDV. The possibility that MCV may be associated with syndromes of acute enteritis in preweaning mink is discussed.","Have, P.; Moving, V.; Svansson, V.; Uttenthal, Å.; Bloch, B.",Veterinary Microbiology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811359290135G; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/037811359290135G; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1319622/,21
657247,Performance and Microbial Community Analysis of an Electrobiofilm Reactor Enhanced by Ferrous-EDTA,2021-07-06,"BACKGROUND: There is a worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, and as the number of patients increases, an increasing number of patients are recovering. However, no relevant systematic review or meta-analysis has been designed to evaluate the effects of acupoint herbal patching on the life of patients recovering from COVID-19. METHODS: The following electronic databases will be searched from the respective dates of database inception to April 20, 2021: The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, MEDLINE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Wanfang database, the Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), and other sources. All published randomized controlled trials in English or Chinese related to acupoint herbal patching for COVID-19 will be included. The primary outcome was the timing of the influence of acupoint herbal patching on the quality of life of convalescent patients. Secondary outcomes were accompanying symptoms (such as myalgia, expectoration, stuffiness, runny nose, pharyngalgia, anhelation, chest distress, dyspnea, crackles, headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea) disappearance rate, negative COVID-19 results rate on two consecutive occasions (not on the same day), average hospitalization time, clinical curative effect, and improved quality of life. RESULTS: The main purpose of this systematic review protocol was to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupoint herbal patching therapy for treating patients recovering from COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of our study will provide evidence to judge whether acupoint herbal patching is an effective intervention for the quality of life in patients recovering.

Yet there is a lack of validated questionnaires that measure these attitudes. The goal of our study was to construct and validate such a questionnaire and use it to assess attitudes of Croatian scientists. We first developed a 21-item questionnaire called Attitudes towards Open data sharing, preprinting, and peer-review (ATOPP), which had a reliable four-factor structure, and measured attitudes towards open data, preprint servers, open peer-review and open peer-review in small scientific communities. We then used the ATOPP to explore attitudes of Croatian scientists (n = 541) towards these topics, and to assess the association of their attitudes with their open science practices and demographic information. Overall, Croatian scientists’ attitudes towards these topics were generally neutral, with a median (Md) score of 3.3 out of max 5 on the scale score. We also found no gender (P = 0.995) or field differences (P = 0.523) in their attitudes. However, attitudes of scientist who previously engaged in open peer-review or preprinting were higher than of scientists that did not (Md 3.5 vs. 3.3, P<0.001, and Md 3.6 vs 3.3, P<0.001, respectively). Further research is needed to determine optimal ways of increasing scientists’ attitudes and their open science practices.","Baždarić, Ksenija; Vrkić, Iva; Arh, Evgenia; Mavrinac, Martina; Gligora Marković, Maja; Bilić-Zulle, Lidija; Stojanovski, Jadranka; Malički, Mario",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34153041/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244529,21
657325,Immunogenicity and efficacy of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored Rift Valley Fever vaccine in mice,2013-12-05,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a common reason for people to consult in primary care, and contribute to antibiotic overuse and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Alternative approaches to supporting patients with RTIs may help, but it is important to understand public perceptions about these approaches before they are widely implemented. AIM: To describe public perceptions regarding finger-prick testing, back-up antibiotic prescriptions (BUPs), and alternatives to traditional consultations for RTIs, and identify factors associated with favouring these approaches. DESIGN & SETTING: Online national survey (HealthWise Wales) with linked primary care health record data. METHOD: Survey item response distributions were described. Associations between responses about consultation alternatives, BUP, and finger-prick point-of-care testing (POCT), and potential explanatory variables, were explored using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 8752 participants completed the survey between 2016 and 2018. The survey found 76.7% (n = 3807/4,966) and 71.2% (n = 3529/4,953) of responders with valid responses were in favour of being able to consult with a pharmacist or nurse in their GP surgery, or with a community pharmacist, respectively. It also showed 92.8% (n = 8034/8659) of responders indicated they would be happy to have a finger-prick test to guide antibiotic prescribing, and 31.8% (n = 2746/8646) indicated they would like to be given a BUP if their clinician thought immediate antibiotics were not required. In addition, 47.4% (n = 2342/4944) and 42.3% (n = 2095/4949) were in favour of having video and email consultations, respectively. Characteristics associated with different response options were identified. CONCLUSION: Consulting with pharmacists, using electronic communication tools, and finger-prick testing are widely acceptable approaches. BUP was described as acceptable less often, and is likely to require greater information and support when used.","Moore, Alex; Cannings-John, Rebecca; Butler, Christopher C; McNulty, Cliodna AM; Francis, Nick A",BJGP open,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgpo.2020.0124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33293410/,21
657554,Biochemical Aspects of Coronavirus Replication,2006,"Background: Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is widely used in pregnancy and generally regarded as “safe” by regulatory authorities. Methods: Clinically relevant doses of paracetamol were administered intraperitoneally to pregnant rats twice daily from embryonic day E15 to 19 (chronic) or as a single dose at E19 (acute). Control samples were from un-treated age-matched animals. At E19, rats were anaesthetised, administered a final paracetamol dose, uteruses were opened and fetuses exposed for sample collection. For RNA sequencing, placentas and fetal brains were removed and flash frozen. Fetal and maternal plasma and cerebrospinal fluid were assayed for α-fetoprotein and interleukin 1β (IL1β). Brains were fixed and examined (immunohistochemistry) for plasma protein distribution. Placental permeability to a small molecule ( (14)C-sucrose) was tested by injection into either mother or individual fetuses; fetal and maternal blood was sampled at regular intervals to 90 minutes. Results: RNA sequencing revealed a large number of genes up- or down-regulated in placentas from acutely or chronically treated animals compared to controls. Most notable was down-regulation of three acute phase plasma proteins (α-fetoprotein, transferrin, transthyretin) in acute and especially chronic experiments and marked up-regulation of immune-related genes, particularly cytokines, again especially in chronically treated dams. IL1β increased in plasma of most fetuses from treated dams but to variable levels and no IL1β was detectable in plasma of control fetuses or any of the dams. Increased placental permeability appeared to be only from fetus to mother for both (14)C-sucrose and α-fetoprotein, but not in the reverse direction. In the fetal brain, gene regulatory changes were less prominent than in the placenta of treated fetuses and did not involve inflammatory-related genes; there was no evidence of increased blood-brain barrier permeability. Conclusion: Results suggest that paracetamol may induce an immune-inflammatory-like response in placenta and more caution should be exercised in use of paracetamol in pregnancy.","Koehn, Liam M.; Huang, Yifan; Habgood, Mark D; Kysenius, Kai; Crouch, Peter J.; Dziegielewska, Katarzyna M; Saunders, Norman R",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32934805/; https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.24119.2,21

Data of patients with TAFRO syndrome were extracted from a Japanese patient registry. Patients were divided into groups according to the clinical and laboratory parameters at initial presentation. Cut-off values for the laboratory parameters were determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and by clinical relevance. Patient survival was analyzed by the Kaplan–Meier method. Univariable analysis was performed using log-rank tests. Multivariable analyses were performed with the logistic regression model and the Cox-proportional hazards model. We extracted the data of 83 patients with TAFRO syndrome from the registry. Univariable analysis identified several potential prognostic factors. Of these factors, age ≥ 60 years and D-dimer ≥ 18 μg/dL remained significant predictors of poor overall survival in the multivariable Cox-proportional hazards model. Based on these results, we developed a simple prognostic scoring system for TAFRO syndrome (TS-PSS). Patients in our cohort were stratified into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups by the TS-PSS. This system should be verified with independent patient cohorts in future studies.

By distinguishing contaminations generated by imported cases from those originating in the community, we are able to evaluate the contribution of importations to the dynamics of the disease in a community. We find that after an initial seeding, the role of importations becomes marginal compared to that of community-based propagation. We also evaluate the role of two travel control measures, quarantine and travel interruptions. We conclude that quarantine is an efficacious way of lowering importation rates, while travel interruptions have the potential to delay the consequences of importations but need to be applied within a very tight time window following the initial emergence of the variant.","Arino, J.; Boelle, P.-Y.; Milliken, E.

However, next-generation sequencing has not been used for routine viral detection in clinical respiratory samples owing to its sophisticated technology. Here, several pharyngeal samples with COPD were collected to enrich viral particles using an optimized method (M3), which involved M1 with centrifugation, filtration, and concentration, M2 (magnetic beads) combined with mixed nuclease digestion, and M4 with no pretreatment as a control. Metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analyses showed that the M3 method for viral enrichment was superior in both viral sequencing composition and viral taxa when compared to M1, M2, and M4. M3 acquired the most viral reads and more complete sequences within 15-h performance, indicating that it might be feasible for viral detection in multiple respiratory samples in clinical practice. Based on sequence similarity analysis, 12 human viruses, including nine Anelloviruses and three coronaviruses, were characterized. Coronavirus OC43 with the largest number of viral reads accounted for nearly complete (99.8%) genome sequences, indicating that it may be a major viral pathogen involved in exacerbation of COPD.","Liu, Bo; Shao, Nan; Wang, Jing; Zhou, SiYu; Su, HaoXiang; Dong, Jie; Sun, LiLian; Li, Li; Zhang, Ting; Yang, Fan",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32754134/,21

In this study, we adopted a mammalian two-hybrid system to screen the genome-wide intraviral protein-protein interactions of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and therefrom revealed a number of novel interactions which could be partly confirmed by in vitro biochemical assays. Three pairs of the interactions identified were detected in both directions: non-structural protein (nsp) 10 and nsp14, nsp10 and nsp16, and nsp7 and nsp8. The interactions between the multifunctional nsp10 and nsp14 or nsp16, which are the unique proteins found in the members of Nidovirales with large RNA genomes including coronaviruses and toroviruses, may have important implication for the mechanisms of replication/transcription complex assembly and functions of these viruses. Using a SARS-CoV replicon expressing a luciferase reporter under the control of a transcription regulating sequence, it has been shown that several viral proteins (N, X and SUD domains of nsp3, and nsp12) provided in trans stimulated the replicon reporter activity, indicating that these proteins may regulate coronavirus replication and transcription.

Particle generation and size are key determinant for pathogen carriage, aerosolisation, and transmission. Production of infectious respiratory particles is dependent on the type and frequency of respiratory activity, type and site of infection and pathogen load. Further, relative humidity, particle aggregation and mucus properties influence expelled particle size and subsequent transmission. Review of 26 studies reporting particle sizes generated from breathing, coughing, sneezing and talking showed healthy individuals generate particles between 0.01 and 500 μm, and individuals with infections produce particles between 0.05 and 500 μm. This indicates that expelled particles carrying pathogens do not exclusively disperse by airborne or droplet transmission but avail of both methods simultaneously and current dichotomous infection control precautions should be updated to include measures to contain both modes of aerosolised transmission.","Gralton, Jan; Tovey, Euan; McLaws, Mary-Louise; Rawlinson, William D.",J Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094184/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445310003476; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445310003476; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2010.11.010,21

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been leveraged amid the COVID-19 pandemic; however, little is known about its use for supporting public health efforts. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to explore how AI technology is being used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported in the literature. Thus, it is the first review that describes and summarizes features of the identified AI techniques and data sets used for their development and validation. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). We searched the most commonly used electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo) between April 10 and 12, 2020. These terms were selected based on the target intervention (ie, AI) and the target disease (ie, COVID-19). Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the extracted data. RESULTS: We considered 82 studies out of the 435 retrieved studies. The most common use of AI was diagnosing COVID-19 cases based on various indicators. AI was also employed in drug and vaccine discovery or repurposing and for assessing their safety. Further, the included studies used AI for forecasting the epidemic development of COVID-19 and predicting its potential hosts and reservoirs. Researchers used AI for patient outcome–related tasks such as assessing the severity of COVID-19, predicting mortality risk, its associated factors, and the length of hospital stay. AI was used for infodemiology to raise awareness to use water, sanitation, and hygiene. The most prominent AI technique used was convolutional neural network, followed by support vector machine. CONCLUSIONS: The included studies showed that AI has the potential to fight against COVID-19. However, many of the proposed methods are not yet clinically accepted. Thus, the most rewarding research will be on methods promising value beyond COVID-19.

METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we recruited Geneva University Hospitals employees and sampled them 3 times, every 3 weeks from March 30 to June 12, 2020. We measured the proportion of seroconverted employees and determined prevalence ratios of risk factors for seroconversion using multivariate mixed-effects Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Overall, 3,421 participants (29% of all employees) were included, with 92% follow-up. The proportion of seroconverted employees increased from 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7%–5.1%) at baseline to 8.5% [(95% CI, 7.6%–9.5%) at the last visit.

METHODS: We compared the immunological landscape between COVID-19 and two other contagious respiratory illnesses (influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)) by clustering analysis of the three diseases based on 27 immune signatures’ scores. RESULTS: We identified three immune subtypes: Immunity-H, Immunity-M, and Immunity-L, which displayed high, medium, and low immune signatures, respectively. We found 20%, 35.5%, and 44.5% of COVID-19 cases included in Immunity-H, Immunity-M, and Immunity-L, respectively; all influenza cases were included in Immunity-H; 66.7% and 33.3% of RSV cases belonged to Immunity-H and Immunity-L, respectively. These data indicate that most COVID-19 patients have weaker immune signatures than influenza and RSV patients, as evidenced by 22 of the 27 immune signatures having lower enrichment scores in COVID-19 than in influenza and/or RSV. The Immunity-M COVID-19 patients had the highest expression levels of ACE2 and IL-6 and lowest viral loads and were the youngest. In contrast, the Immunity-H COVID-19 patients had the lowest expression levels of ACE2 and IL-6 and highest viral loads and were the oldest. Most immune signatures had lower enrichment levels in the intensive care unit (ICU) than in non-ICU patients. Gene ontology analysis showed that the innate and adaptive immune responses were significantly downregulated in COVID-19 versus healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to influenza and RSV, COVID-19 displayed significantly different immunological profiles. Elevated immune signatures are associated with better prognosis in COVID-19 patients.","Abdelrahman, Zeinab; Chen, Zuobing; Lyu, Haoyu; Wang, Xiaosheng",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037021001550; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.04.043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907612/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037021001550?v=s5,21

To date, no drug or vaccine has been approved to treat the severe disease caused by this coronavirus, COVID-19. In this paper, we will focus on the main virus-based and host-based targets that can guide efforts in medicinal chemistry to discover new drugs for this devastating disease. In principle, all CoV enzymes and proteins involved in viral replication and the control of host cellular machineries are potentially druggable targets in the search for therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2. This Perspective provides an overview of the main targets from a structural point of view, together with reported therapeutic compounds with activity against SARS-CoV-2 and/or other CoVs. Also, the role of innate immune response to coronavirus infection and the related therapeutic options will be presented.","Gil, Carmen; Ginex, Tiziana; Maestro, Inés; Nozal, Vanesa; Barrado-Gil, Lucía; Cuesta-Geijo, Miguel Ángel; Urquiza, Jesús; Ramírez, David; Alonso, Covadonga; Campillo, Nuria E.; Martinez, Ana",J Med Chem,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511912/,21

Its narrative and strategies reinforces the counter‐hegemonic movement that denounces the logics of commodification and financialisation in the housing sector, placing hope in a post‐capitalist transition in the post‐COVID horizon. We conclude that the actors in this urban struggle have limited power over the changes they initiate, or make an effort to inflict, if they are not involved in a concerted and politically integrated action, not least because the achievements they obtain are temporary and exceptional, like the state of emergency imposed by COVID‐19.","Mendes, Luís",Tijdschr Econ Soc Geogr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834145/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tesg.12450,21
663754,Discovering human history from stomach bacteria,2003-04-28,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to changes in stroke patients' healthcare use. This study evaluated changes in Korean stroke patients' health-seeking behaviors and stroke care services using data from the Korean Stroke Registry (KSR). METHODS: We reviewed data from patients with acute stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) during 2019 (before COVID-19 period) and 2020 (COVID-19 period). Outcomes included patient characteristics, time from stroke onset to hospital arrival, and in-hospital stroke pathways. Subgroup analyses were performed for an epidemic region (Daegu city and Gyeongsangbuk-do region, the D-G region). RESULTS: The study included 1,792 patients from the pre-COVID-19 period and 1,555 patients from the COVID-19 period who visited hospitals that contribute to the KSR. During the COVID-19 period, the D-G region had two-thirds the number of cases (vs. the pre-CO-VID-19 period) and a significant decrease in the proportion of patients with TIA (9.97%-2.91%). Unlike other regions, the median onset-to-door time increased significantly in the D-G region (361 min vs. 526.5 min, p = 0.016), and longer onset-to-door times were common for patients with mild symptoms and who were in their 60s or 70s. The number of patients who underwent intravenous thrombolysis also decreased during the COVID-19 period, although the treatment times were not significantly different between the 2 periods. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Korean stroke patients in a CO-VID-19 epidemic region exhibited distinct changes in health-seeking behaviors. Appropriate triage system and public education regarding the importance of early treatment are needed during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jeong, Han-Yeong; Lee, Eung-Joon; Kang, Min Kyoung; Nam, Ki-Woong; Bae, Jeonghoon; Jeon, Kipyoung; Jung, Keun-Hwa; Ko, Sang-Bae; Oh, Mi Sun; Lee, Ji Sung; Hwang, Jaechun; Jeong, Eunhwan; Lee, Jun; Do, Jin-Kuk; Sohn, Sung-Il; Kwon, Sun U; Bae, Hee-Joon; Yoon, Byung-Woo; Park, Jong-Moo",Cerebrovasc Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34592732/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000519093,21

664038,Sulfur modification in natural RNA and therapeutic oligonucleotides,2021-04-27,"Background While specific interventions have previously demonstrated benefit in patients with the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), use of these interventions is inconsistent, and patient mortality remains high. The impact of variability in center management practices on ARDS mortality rates remains unknown. Research Question What is the impact of treatment variability on mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS in the United States (US)? Study Design and Methods We conducted a multicenter, observational cohort study of mechanically ventilated adults with ARDS and PaO2/FiO2 < 150 on positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) > 5 cm H2O, who were admitted to 29 US centers between October 1, 2016 and April 30, 2017. The primary outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality. Center variation in ventilator management, adjunctive therapy use, and mortality were also assessed. Results A total of 2,466 patients were enrolled. Median baseline PaO2/FiO2 was 105 (IQR 78.0, 129.0). In-hospital 28-day mortality was 40.7%. Initial adherence to lung protective ventilation (tidal volume < 6.5 ml/kg predicted body weight, plateau pressure and/or peak inspiratory pressure < 30mm H2O) was 31.4% and varied between centers (0%-65%), as did rates of adjunctive therapy use (27.1%-96.4%), types of modalities used (neuromuscular blockade, prone positioning, systemic steroids, pulmonary vasodilators, and extracorporeal support), and mortality (16.7-73.3%). Center standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), calculated using baseline patient-level characteristics to derive expected mortality rate, ranged from 0.33 to 1.98. Of the treatment-level factors explored, only center adherence to early lung protective ventilation (LPV) was correlated with SMR. Interpretation Substantial center-to-center variability exists in ARDS management, suggesting that further opportunities for improving ARDS outcomes exist. Early adherence to LPV was associated with lower center mortality and may be a surrogate for overall quality of care processes. Future collaboration is needed to identify additional treatment-level factors influencing center-level outcomes.

The paper computed financial disclosure quality by empirically combining earning qualities of accrual, persistence, predictability, and smoothness. Using content analysis and survey questionnaire research methods, it calculated sustainability quality by combining disclosure quantity (through quantitative weightings), disclosure type (through qualitative weightings), and disclosure item importance (through qualitative weightings) of economic, social, and environmental disclosures made in annual and sustainability reports, ascertained using the Global Reporting Initiative sustainability framework. The study finds that sustainability disclosure in the current period is sufficiently associated with financial disclosure quality of the current period and future period. Consistent with stakeholder theory, firms with a social reputation are perceived as trustworthy by stakeholders and shareholders. The findings lead to a cultural stakeholder theory where underlying values of societal culture create a condition supporting mutual stakeholder relationships between firm and various stakeholders. Demonstrating trustworthiness through disclosures can help boost consumer confidence and foreign trade relations for Chinese firms. The Chinese government can design innovative schemes to reward and promote trustworthiness in firms, such as regulating base-point reductions in interest rates on borrowing or raising funds.","Abeysekera, Indra; Li, Feng; Lu, Yingjun",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34048431/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250884,21
665031,Multitask learning for host–pathogen protein interactions,2013-07-01,"BACKGROUND: Opioid misuse screening in hospitals is resource-intensive and rarely done. Many hospitalized patients are never offered opioid treatment. An automated approach leveraging routinely captured electronic health record (EHR) data may be easier for hospitals to institute. We previously derived and internally validated an opioid classifier in a separate hospital setting. The aim is to externally validate our previously published and open-source machine-learning classifier at a different hospital for identifying cases of opioid misuse. METHODS: An observational cohort of 56,227 adult hospitalizations was examined between October 2017 and December 2019 during a hospital-wide substance use screening program with manual screening. Manually completed Drug Abuse Screening Test served as the reference standard to validate a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier with coded word embedding features from the clinical notes of the EHR. The opioid classifier utilized all notes in the EHR and sensitivity analysis was also performed on the first 24 h of notes. Calibration was performed to account for the lower prevalence than in the original cohort. RESULTS: Manual screening for substance misuse was completed in 67.8% (n = 56,227) with 1.1% (n = 628) identified with opioid misuse. The data for external validation included 2,482,900 notes with 67,969 unique clinical concept features. The opioid classifier had an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI 0.99–0.99) across the encounter and 0.98 (95% CI 0.98–0.99) using only the first 24 h of notes. In the calibrated classifier, the sensitivity and positive predictive value were 0.81 (95% CI 0.77–0.84) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.68–0.75). For the first 24 h, they were 0.75 (95% CI 0.71–0.78) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.57–0.64). CONCLUSIONS: Our opioid misuse classifier had good discrimination during external validation. Our model may provide a comprehensive and automated approach to opioid misuse identification that augments current workflows and overcomes manual screening barriers.

666827,Mating strategy is determinant of adenovirus prevalence in European bats,2020-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Mentoring is a recognized, but still underutilized strategy for effective clinical training of midwifery students. The success of formally recognized course-embedded mentoring depends on adequate preparation of clinical teacher to act as mentors and effective developing of their mentoring skills. The aim of this study was to evaluate a Mentor Training Program for midwives, the first of its kind in Poland. METHODS: Twenty-one midwives who completed a dedicated Mentor Training Program organized by the Medical University of Warsaw (12–14 June 2017) participated in this study. In Stage 1, 7 days prior to the training course, the participants completed an online questionnaire that identified their motivations and expectations. In Stage 2, they assessed the training program they had completed as well as described any perceived needs of further mentor training. Subsequently a qualitative study of the data was performed using content analysis. RESULTS: In Stage 1, the participants expressed their interest in the Mentor Training Program mostly expecting to develop skills allowing them to implement mentoring in clinical training of student midwives. They were aware of the potential benefits of mentoring for hands-on instruction on the wards and wanted to gain knowledge of this strategy. In Stage 2, the overall satisfaction with the program was high, but the participants assessed their preparedness to act as midwifery mentors as inadequate. The results suggest that the Mentor Training Program should be further refined and expanded while the outcomes need to be evaluated in more detail by both new mentors and their trainers over a longer period of time, possibly after the participants have gained actual experience of mentoring in the clinical setting. CONCLUSION: The participants described the Mentor Training Program as innovative, valuable and largely meeting their expectations. They gained knowledge of the concept of mentoring and its potential application in clinical training of midwifery students in Poland. Future mentor training programs should be expanded with a greater focus on developing, strengthening and applying mentoring skills in the clinical setting.

There were lot of attempts for developing efficient air and liquid filters as the demand increases with an utmost concern of present environmental situations. Thanks to its large surface area to volume ratio, polymer nanofibers and composites are found to be good substitute for conventional filters. As per the research and analysis data, filtration efficiency increases proportional to the reduction of the average diameter of the fibers. In this study, the most efficient electrospinning technology was adopted to prepare polycarbonate (PC) nanofiber mat which yields a very fine surface morphology. There are earlier researches and associated data available about the preparation of PC nanofibers but with average fiber diameter above 1000 nm. In this study, a systematic methodology was instigated to generate PC nanofibers with least average diameter of 90 nm without using any surfactants or salts. The most suitable solvents, solvent proportion, polymer concentration and electrospinning conditions for the formation of the fiber mat are discussed elaborately. PC fiber mat of least average diameter was proved to be highly efficient for particulate matter adsorption using a dust sampling analyzer.","Baby, Thomas; Jose, Tomlal E.; Aravindkumar, C.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of facemasks on gas exchange. METHODS: Healthy adults were assessed at rest and during slow and brisk 5-minute walks, with and without masks. We monitored O2 saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), and heart and respiratory rates. Participants graded their subjective difficulty and completed individual sensations questionnaires. RESULTS: Twenty-one participants with a median age of 38 years (range, 29-57 years) were recruited. At rest, all vital signs remained normal, without and with masks. However, during slow and brisk walks, EtCO2 increased; the rise was significantly higher while wearing masks: slow walk, mean EtCO2 (mmHg) change +4.5 ± 2.4 versus +2.9 ± 2.3, P = .004; brisk walk EtCO2 change +8.4 ± 3.0 versus +6.2 ± 4.0, P = .009, with and without masks, respectively. Wearing masks was also associated with higher proportions of participant hypercarbia (EtCO2 range, 46-49 mmHg) compared with walking without masks, though this was only partially significant. Mean O2-saturation remained stable (98%) while walking without masks but decreased by 1.2 % ± 2.2 while walking briskly with a mask (P = .01). Mild desaturation (O2 range, 93% to 96%) was noted during brisk walks among 43% of participants with masks, compared with only 14% without masks (P = .08). Borg's scale significantly increased while walking with a mask, for both slow and brisk walks (P < .001). Sensations of difficulty breathing and shortness of breath were more common while walking with masks. CONCLUSION: While important to prevent viral spread, wearing facemasks during brisk 5-minute walks might be associated with mild hypercarbia and desaturation. The clinical significance of these minor gas exchange abnormalities is unclear and should be further investigated.","Bar-On, Ophir; Gendler, Yulia; Stafler, Patrick; Levine, Hagit; Steuer, Guy; Shmueli, Einat; Prais, Dario; Mei-Zahav, Meir",J Am Board Fam Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34312270/; https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.04.200559,21

Stay-at-home orders and social distancing compounded with COVID-19 concerns have caused significant disruptions in daily life. One notable effect of these variables may be a change in the number of emergency department (ED) visits. This study aims to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on ED visits, and possible reasons for changes. METHODS: Retrospective analysis using CDC data for ED visits and percentage of visits for COVID-19-Like Illness (CLI) and Influenza-Like Illness (ILI). Google Trends was used to assess COVID-19 public awareness. Motor vehicle collision (MVC) data was collected from cities, which reported current data. A descriptive statistical analysis and two-sample t-test was performed on ED visit data to assess for significance and a descriptive analysis was conducted to assess COVID-19's impact on MVCs. RESULTS: The mean number of ED visits per week for the last four weeks of available data during the pandemic was significantly less than the four weeks prior to COVID-19 pandemic (p = 0.008). The ED visit decrease per week varied by region, with Region 1 having the greatest decrease (45%). MVCs decreased substantially across all cities studied, with New York City and Baton Rouge experiencing the greatest decrease (66%) during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: A number of factors have likely contributed to the substantial decrease in ED visits observed in this study.

Characterized by dysmorphic mitochondria and increased cytoplasmic cytochrome c, apoptosis of these cells was inhibited by preventing VDAC aggregation or blocking caspase activation. Further, we observed a marked increase in Hexokinase II(+) polymorphonuclear-myeloid derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC). While PMN-MDSC were also found in the PBMC of patients with other viral infections, the Hexokinase II(+) PMN-MDSC were found exclusively in the acute COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe disease. Finally, we identified a population of monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) expressing high carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1a) and VDAC, which were present in the PBMC of the acute COVID-19 patients, but not recovered COVID-19 patients and whose presence correlated with severity of disease.

COPD exacerbations increase with increasing severity of COPD. Earlier descriptions of COPD exacerbations had concentrated mainly on studies of hospital admission, though most COPD exacerbations are treated in the community and not associated with hospital admission. Exacerbation frequency is an important determinant of health status in COPD and is thus one of the important outcome measures in COPD. Factors predictive of frequent exacerbations included daily cough and sputum and frequent exacerbations in the previous year. In a further prospective analysis of 504 exacerbations, where daily monitoring was performed, there was some deterioration in symptoms, though no there were significant peak expiratory flow changes. Recovery was longer in the presence of increased dyspnoea or symptoms of a common cold at exacerbation. The changes observed in lung function at exacerbation were smaller than those observed at asthmatic exacerbations. The reasons for the incomplete recovery of symptoms and lung function are not clear, but may involve inadequate treatment or persistence of the causative agent. The incomplete physiological recovery after an exacerbation could contribute to the decline in lung function with time in patients with COPD. The association of the symptoms of increased dyspnoea and of the common cold at exacerbation with a prolonged recovery suggests that viral infections may lead to more prolonged exacerbations.","Wedzicha, Jadwiga A.",Asthma and COPD,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123740014000675; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123740014000675,21

Instead of deferring or delaying the procedure, we developed and implemented a novel percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) protocol aimed at minimizing the risk of transmission while maintaining favorable procedural outcome. Patients and Methods. All patients who underwent PDT per novel protocol were included in the study. The key element of the protocol was the use of apnea during the critical part of the insertion and upon any opening of the ventilator circuit. This was coupled with the use of enhanced personnel protection equipment (PPE) with a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). The operators underwent antibody serology testing and were evaluated for COVID-19 symptoms two weeks from the last procedure included in the study. RESULTS: Between March 12th and June 30th, 2020, a total of 32 patients underwent PDT per novel protocol. The majority (80%) were positive for COVID-19 at the time of the procedure. The success rate was 94%. Only one patient developed minor self-limited bleeding. None of the proceduralists developed positive serology or any symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: A novel protocol that uses periods of apnea during opening of the ventilator circuit along with PAPR-enhanced PPE for PDT on COVID-19 patients appears to be effective and safe for patients and healthcare providers.","Boujaoude, Ziad; Madisi, Nagendra; Patel, Bhavi; Rachoin, Jean-Sebastien; Dellinger, R.

669295,Antimicrobial lead compounds from marine plants,2020-01-24,"BACKGROUND: Fever and respiratory symptoms are the major causes of hospitalisation in infants aged 90 days or less. Respiratory viruses (RVs) are detected by multiplex reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (mRT‐PCR) in up to 70% of infants tested in this population. Aminotransferase elevation is not uncommon in RV infections, and repeat laboratory investigations are frequent due to concerns regarding the occurrence of hepatic disease. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study included 271 infants aged 8‐90 days, with positive RV mRT‐PCR results. Data were obtained on demographics, laboratory results and final diagnoses of hepatobiliary disease. RESULTS: Fever (73.1%) and/or respiratory symptoms (75.6%) were the major presentations among the hospitalised infants. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were elevated in 62 (22.9%) of the 271 infants. Twenty‐four of these 62 infants had their first follow‐up, and 19 (79.2%) showed persistent elevation. All 10 (100%) infants who had their second follow‐up showed persistently elevated aminotransferase levels. Eventually, none of the 10 infants were diagnosed with hepatic disease during the median follow‐up of 10 days (range 3‐232 days). Among the RVs of interest, parainfluenza virus type 1 was significantly associated with aminotransferase elevation (odds ratio: 2.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11‐7.83). CONCLUSIONS: RV‐related non‐specific hepatitis is occasionally observed in infants aged 8‐90 days, and ALT elevation is the most common abnormality. However, a final diagnosis of primary hepatobiliary disease appears to be rare. Therefore, regular follow‐ups and targeted testing may be recommended in this specific population.","Kim, Sang Gyeom; Oh, Yu Na; Lee, Joon Kee",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32157800/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12732,21

Protein kinase R (PK)R is an important protein in the host viral response; however, the role of PKR in CSFV infection remains unknown. This issue was addressed in the present study using the PK-15 swine kidney cell line. We found that CSFV infection increased the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)2α and its kinase PKR. However, the expression of viral proteins continued to increase. Furthermore, PKR overexpression enhanced CSFV replication, while PKR inhibition resulted in reduced CSFV replication and an increase in interferon (IFN) induction. In addition, PKR was responsible for eIF2α phosphorylation in CSFV-infected cells. These results suggest that the activation of PKR during CSFV infection is beneficial to the virus. The virus is able to commandeer the host cell's translation machinery for viral protein synthesis while evading innate immune defenses.","Liu, Wen-Jun; Yang, You-Tian; Zhao, Ming-Qiu; Dong, Xiao-Ying; Gou, Hong-Chao; Pei, Jing-Jing; Chen, Jin-Ding",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25899421/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.04.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817021500146X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817021500146X,21
670392,Mechanism of Viral Glycoprotein Targeting by Membrane-Associated RING-CH Proteins,2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is associated with cardiovascular injury, but left ventricular (LV) function is largely preserved. We aimed to evaluate for subclinical LV dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 through myocardial strain analysis. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent echocardiography. Traditional echocardiographic and global longitudinal strain (GLS) values were compared with prior and subsequent echocardiograms. RESULTS: Among 96 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with complete echocardiograms, 67 (70%) had adequate image quality for strain analysis. The cohort was predominantly male (63%) and 18% had prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Echocardiograms were largely normal with median [IQR] LV ejection fraction (EF) 62% [56%, 68%]. However, median GLS was abnormal in 91% (-13.5% [-15.0%, -10.8%]). When stratified by CVD, both groups had abnormal GLS, but presence of CVD was associated with worse median GLS (-11.6% [-13.4%, -7.2%] vs -13.9% [-15.0%, -11.3%], p=0.03). There was no difference in EF or GLS when stratified by symptoms or need for intensive care. Compared to pre-COVID-19 echocardiograms, EF was unchanged, but median GLS was significantly worse (-15% [-16%, -14%] vs -12% [-14%, -10%], p=0.003). Serial echocardiograms showed no significant changes in GLS or EF overall, however patients who died had stable or worsening GLS, while those who survived to discharge home showed improved GLS. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 had evidence of subclinical cardiac dysfunction manifested by reduced GLS despite preserved EF. These findings were observed regardless of history of CVD, presence of COVID-19 symptoms, or severity of illness.

Asthma is a common chronic medical condition in children that is uniquely susceptible to changes brought upon by COVID-19. Sudden dramatic changes in the environment, medical practice, and medication use have altered the asthma management landscape with potential impacts on asthma outcomes. In this paper, we review how changes in transportation and travel patterns, school attendance, physical activity, and time spent indoors, along with changes in healthcare delivery since the start of the pandemic all play a contributing role in asthma control in children. We review potentially important influences of asthma control in children during the COVID-19 pandemic worthy of further study.","Oreskovic, Nicolas M.; Kinane, T Bernard; Aryee, Emmanuel; Kuhlthau, Karen A.; Perrin, James M.",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32497662/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213219820305237; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.05.027; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213219820305237?v=s5,21

We have suggested previously that the infection rate of this virus might be lower in people living at high altitude (over 2,500 m) compared to that in the lowlands. Based on data from official sources, we performed a new epidemiological analysis of the development of the pandemic in 23 countries on the American continent as of May 23, 2020. Our results confirm our previous finding, further showing that the incidence of COVID-19 on the American continent decreases significantly starting at 1,000 m above sea level (masl). Moreover, epidemiological modeling indicates that the virus transmission rate is lower in the highlands (>1,000 masl) than in the lowlands (<1,000 masl). Finally, evaluating the differences in the recovery percentage of patients, the death-to-case ratio, and the theoretical fraction of undiagnosed cases, we found that the severity of COVID-19 is also decreased above 1,000 m. We conclude that the impact of the COVID-19 decreases significantly with altitude.","Arias-Reyes, Christian; Carvajal-Rodriguez, Favio; Poma-Machicao, Liliana; Aliaga-Raduán, Fernanda; Marques, Danuzia A.; Zubieta-DeUrioste, Natalia; Accinelli, Roberto Alfonso; Schneider-Gasser, Edith M.; Zubieta-Calleja, Gustavo; Dutschmann, Mathias; Soliz, Jorge",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780470/,21
672165,Characterization of a coronavirus II. Glycoproteins of the viral envelope: Tryptic peptide analysis,1977-04-30,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic posed major challenges in obstetric health care services. Preparedness, development, and implementation of new protocols were part of the needed response. This study aims to describe the strategies implemented and the perspectives of health managers on the challenges to face the pandemic in 16 different maternity hospitals that comprise a multicenter study in Brazil, called REBRACO (Brazilian network of COVID-19 during pregnancy). METHODS: Mixed-method study, with quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative data on the infrastructure of the units, maternal and perinatal health indicators, modifications on staff and human resources, from January to July/2020. Also, information on total number of cases, and availability for COVID-19 testing. A qualitative study by purposeful and saturation sampling was undertaken with healthcare managers, to understand perspectives on local challenges in facing the pandemic. RESULTS: Most maternities early implemented their contingency plan. REBRACO centers reported 338 confirmed COVID-19 cases among pregnant and post-partum women up to July 2020. There were 29 maternal deaths and 15 (51.8%) attributed to COVID-19. All maternities performed relocation of beds designated to labor ward, most (75%) acquired mechanical ventilators, only the minority (25%) installed new negative air pressure rooms. Considering human resources, around 40% hired extra health professionals and increased weekly workload and the majority (68.7%) also suspended annual leaves. Only one center implemented universal screening for childbirth and 6 (37.5%) implemented COVID-19 testing for all suspected cases, while around 60% of the centers only tested moderate/severe cases with hospital admission. Qualitative results showed that main challenges experienced were related to the fear of the virus, concerns about reliability of evidence and lack of resources, with a clear need for mental health support among health professionals. CONCLUSION: Study findings suggest that maternities of the REBRACO initiative underwent major changes in facing the pandemic, with limitations on testing, difficulties in infrastructure and human resources. Leadership, continuous training, implementation of evidence-based protocols and collaborative initiatives are key to transpose the fear of the virus and ascertain adequate healthcare inside maternities, especially in low and middle-income settings. Policy makers need to address the specificities in considering reproductive health and childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic and prioritize research and timely testing availability.","Costa, Maria Laura; Souza, Renato T.; Pacagnella, Rodolfo C.; Bento, Silvana F.; Ribeiro-do-Valle, Carolina C.; Luz, Adriana G.; Lajos, Giuliane J.; Nobrega, Guilherme M.; Griggio, Thayna B.; Charles, Charles M.; Tedesco, Ricardo P.; Fernandes, Karayna G.; Martins-Costa, Sérgio H.

Although the psychological effects of home confinement in children have been described, there is a lack of longitudinal research examining the impact of the confinement over time. The present study analyzes the evolution of the psychological wellbeing of children and adolescents from three European countries with different restrictions. Parents of 624 Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years old completed the “Impact Scale of COVID-19 and Home Confinement on Children and Adolescents” two, five, and eight weeks after the lockdown. Results show a different pattern for each country. Children from Italy, the first European country that applied a lockdown, were better adapted than Spanish and Portuguese children the first two weeks after confinement but they were more psychologically impacted by home confinement at the eight-week assessment. Portuguese children, who followed a general duty of home confinement, were the best adapted to the situation, with no significant differences over time. A significant change was found in anxiety symptoms in Spanish children, with a decrease at the last assessment. Findings suggest that long confinements and hard restrictions affect children, so prevention measures should be applied during confinements to prevent psychological problems in children.","Orgilés, Mireia; Francisco, Rita; Delvecchio, Elisa; Espada, José P.; Mazzeschi, Claudia; Pedro, Marta; Morales, Alexandra",Child Psychiatry Hum Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173126/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-021-01211-9,21

DESIGN: Prospective, population based cohort study using the QResearch database linked to data on covid-19 vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 results, hospital admissions, systemic anticancer treatment, radiotherapy, and the national death and cancer registries. SETTINGS: Adults aged 19-100 years with one or two doses of covid-19 vaccination between 8 December 2020 and 15 June 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was covid-19 related death. Secondary outcome was covid-19 related hospital admission. Outcomes were assessed from 14 days after each vaccination dose. Models were fitted in the derivation cohort to derive risk equations using a range of predictor variables. Performance was evaluated in a separate validation cohort of general practices. RESULTS: Of 6 952 440 vaccinated patients in the derivation cohort, 5 150 310 (74.1%) had two vaccine doses. Of 2031 covid-19 deaths and 1929 covid-19 hospital admissions, 81 deaths (4.0%) and 71 admissions (3.7%) occurred 14 days or more after the second vaccine dose. The risk algorithms included age, sex, ethnic origin, deprivation, body mass index, a range of comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. Incidence of covid-19 mortality increased with age and deprivation, male sex, and Indian and Pakistani ethnic origin. Cause specific hazard ratios were highest for patients with Down’s syndrome (12.7-fold increase), kidney transplantation (8.1-fold), sickle cell disease (7.7-fold), care home residency (4.1-fold), chemotherapy (4.3-fold), HIV/AIDS (3.3-fold), liver cirrhosis (3.0-fold), neurological conditions (2.6-fold), recent bone marrow transplantation or a solid organ transplantation ever (2.5-fold), dementia (2.2-fold), and Parkinson’s disease (2.2-fold). Other conditions with increased risk (ranging from 1.2-fold to 2.0-fold increases) included chronic kidney disease, blood cancer, epilepsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, thromboembolism, peripheral vascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. A similar pattern of associations was seen for covid-19 related hospital admissions. No evidence indicated that associations differed after the second dose, although absolute risks were reduced. The risk algorithm explained 74.1% (95% confidence interval 71.1% to 77.0%) of the variation in time to covid-19 death in the validation cohort. Discrimination was high, with a D statistic of 3.46 (95% confidence interval 3.19 to 3.73) and C statistic of 92.5. Performance was similar after each vaccine dose. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted covid-19 mortality risk, sensitivity for identifying covid-19 deaths within 70 days was 78.7%. CONCLUSION: This population based risk algorithm performed well showing high levels of discrimination for identifying those patients at highest risk of covid-19 related death and hospital admission after vaccination.","Hippisley-Cox, Julia; Coupland, Carol AC; Mehta, Nisha; Keogh, Ruth H; Diaz-Ordaz, Karla; Khunti, Kamlesh; Lyons, Ronan A; Kee, Frank; Sheikh, Aziz; Rahman, Shamim; Valabhji, Jonathan; Harrison, Ewen M; Sellen, Peter; Haq, Nazmus; Semple, Malcolm G; Johnson, Peter W M; Hayward, Andrew; Nguyen-Van-Tam, Jonathan S",BMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34535466/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n2244,21

This includes trajectories and outcomes for men who do and do not become fathers across five annual waves of the study. PARTICIPANTS: Australian resident, English-speaking men aged 28–32 years at baseline were eligible. Recruitment was over a 2-year period (2015–2017) via social and traditional media and through engagement with study partners. Eight hundred and eighteen eligible men consented to participate. Of these, 664 men completed the first online survey of whom 608 consented to ongoing participation. Of the ongoing sample, 83% have participated in at least two of the first three annual online surveys. FINDINGS TO DATE: Three waves of data collection are complete. The first longitudinal analysis of MAPP data, published in 2020, identified five profiles that characterise men’s patterns of depressive symptom severity and presentations of anger. Profiles indicating pronounced anger and depressive symptoms were associated with fathers’ lack of perceived social support, and problems with coparenting and bonding with infants. In a second study, MAPP data were combined with three other Australian cohorts in a meta-analysis of associations between fathers’ self-reported sleep problems up to 3 years postpartum and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. Adjusted meta-analytic associations between paternal sleep and mental health risk ranged from 0.25 to 0.37. FUTURE PLANS: MAPP is an ongoing cohort study. Waves 4 and 5 data will be ready for analyses at the end of 2021. Future investigations will include crossed-lagged and trajectory analyses that assess inter-relatedness and changing social networks, mental health, work and family life.

Different forms of inflammation may also occur in response to tumours, in allergy and autoimmune disorders. Pneumonia, respiratory tract infection and septic shock for instance can arise as serious complications of the Covid-19 virus. While radiotherapy has been most widely used to control malignant tumours, it has also been used for treatment of non-malignant diseases, including acute and chronic inflammation in situations where anti-inflammatory drugs may be ineffective or contraindicated. The present review examines the history and prospects for low-dose anti-inflammatory radiation treatments, the present interest largely being motivated by the increased incidence of pulmonary disease associated Covid-19 infections.

676924,Mass Spectrometry-Based Structural Virology,2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND: There are growing reports of the neurologic involvement among the patients with COVID-19. Headache, confusion, and anosmia following olfactory nerve disruption are the most prevalent presentation of the neurologic involvement related to COVID-19. However, small numbers of the central nervous system (CNS) involvement have been reported. CASE REPORT: A 49-year-old male was referred to our hospital with an abrupt vision loss. Three weeks earlier he was admitted to hospital based on his respiratory symptoms and was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Initial Brain MRI indicated diffuse restricted bilateral foci in both parietal and occipital lobes in favor of acute infarction. Diffuse Weighted Imaging (DWI) demonstrated restricted bilateral hyperintense signals in parietal and occipital region. Occipital cortex biopsy showed brain tissue with focal infiltration of foamy macrophages mixed with reactive astrocytes and no plasma cell infiltration. Considering all the evidence, post-COVID-19 encephalitis diagnosis was considered for the patient, and methyl prednisolone pulse-therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) was initiated. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Although there are growing reports of the neurologic involvement among the patients, blindness can rarely be observed as a complication of post-COVID-19 encephalitis. To our knowledge this is the first case of post-COVID-19 encephalitis which presented with bilateral vision loss primarily.

This was achieved by grafting mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane onto PVC, followed by the growth of zinc oxide nanoparticles covalently bonded on the polymer surface. In this study, the relationship between the physicochemical features of modified-surface PVC and antimicrobial activity on Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans was investigated. Zinc oxide with controllable morphologies (rods, rod flowers, and petal flowers) was synthesized on the polymer surface by tuning merely base-type and concentration using a hydrothermal process. The antimicrobial activity was more pronounced for rod flower morphology, because of their differences in microscopic parameters such as specific Zn-polar planes. This work provides an important hint for the safe use of PVC for biomedical devices by the structure surface tuning without injuring polymer bulk properties and a reduced risk of the covalently bonded nanoparticle dispersion in the host and the environment.","Donnadio, Anna; Roscini, Luca; Di Michele, Alessandro; Corazzini, Valentina; Cardinali, Gianluigi; Ambrogi, Valeria","Materials science & engineering.

677506,Analytical characterization of viruses,2021-10-01,"INTRODUCTION: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is a class of immunotherapy. An economic evaluation conducted at an early stage of development of CAR-T therapy for treatment of adult relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia could provide insight into factors contributing to the cost of treatment, the potential clinical benefits, and what the health system can afford. Traditionally, stakeholders are engaged in certain parts of health technology assessment processes, such as in the identification and selection of technologies, formulation of recommendations, and implementation of recommendations; however, little is known about processes for stakeholder engagement during the conduct of the assessment. This is especially the case for economic evaluations. Stakeholders, such as clinicians, policy-makers, patients, and their support networks, have insight into factors that can enhance the validity of an economic evaluation model. This research outlines a specific methodology for stakeholder engagement and represents an avenue to enhance health economic evaluations and support the use of these models to inform decision making for resource allocation. This protocol may inform a tailored framework for stakeholder engagement processes in future economic evaluation model development. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will involve clinicians, healthcare researchers, payers, and policy-makers, as well as patients and their support networks in the conduct and verification of an early economic evaluation of a novel health technology to incorporate stakeholder-generated knowledge. Three stakeholder-specific focus groups will be conducted using an online adaptation of the nominal group technique to elicit considerations from each. This study will use CAR-T therapy for adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia as a basis for investigating broader stakeholder engagement processes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study received ethics approval from the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute Research Ethics Board (REB 20200320-01HT) and the results will be shared via conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and ongoing stakeholder engagement.","Wilson, Mackenzie; Thavorn, Kednapa; Hawrysh, Terry; Graham, Ian D; Atkins, Harold; Kekre, Natasha; Coyle, Doug; Lalu, Manoj M; Fergusson, Dean A; Chan, Kelvin KW; Ollendorf, Daniel A; Presseau, Justin",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34385243/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046707,21

These variants have in common a higher transmissibility, becoming dominant within populations in a short time, and an accumulation of a high number of mutations in the spike (S) protein, especially within the amino terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor binding domain (RBD). These mutations have direct implications on virus infection rates through higher affinity of S RBD for the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. There are also signs of enhanced virulence, re-infection frequency, and increased resistance to the action of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies from convalescence sera and in vaccinated individuals in regions where the variants spread dominantly. In this review, we describe the different SARS-CoV-2 variants that have thus far been identified in various parts of the world with mutational changes and biological properties as well as their impact in medical countermeasures and human health.","Gómez, Carmen Elena; Perdiguero, Beatriz; Esteban, Mariano",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33799505/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030243,21

A controlled and persistent release of lockdown measures covers many potential strategies and is subject to extensive scenario analyses. Here, we use an individual-based model (STRIDE) to simulate interactions between 11 million inhabitants of Belgium at different levels including extended household settings, i.e., “household bubbles”. The burden of COVID-19 is impacted by both the intensity and frequency of physical contacts, and therefore, household bubbles have the potential to reduce hospital admissions by 90%. In addition, we find that it is crucial to complete contact tracing 4 days after symptom onset. Assumptions on the susceptibility of children affect the impact of school reopening, though we find that business and leisure-related social mixing patterns have more impact on COVID-19 associated disease burden. An optimal deployment of the mitigation policies under study require timely compliance to physical distancing, testing and self-isolation.","Willem, Lander; Abrams, Steven; Libin, Pieter J.

The current pandemic exacerbates the financial and associated resource limitations of OPA. Videoconsulting provides a safe method of real-time contact for some remotely residing patients with hospital-based clinicians. One factor in failing to move from introduction of service change to its general adoption may be lack of patient and public involvement. This project, based in the largest Island in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, aimed to codesign the use of the NHS Near Me video consulting platform for OPA to take place in the patient’s home. A codesign model was used as a framework. This included: step 1—presenting a process flow map of the current system of using Near Me to public participants and establishing their ideas on various steps in the process, step 2—conducting numerous Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) tests and creating a current process flow diagram based on learning and step 3—conducting telephone interviews and thematic analysis of transcripts (n=7) to explore participants’ perceptions of being involved in the codesign process. Twenty-five adaptations were made to the Near Me at Home video appointment process from participants’ PDSA testing. Four themes were identified from thematic analysis of participants’ feedback of the codesign process, namely: altruistic motivation, valuing community voices, the usefulness of the PDSA cycles and the power of ‘word of mouth’. By codesigning the use of Near Me with people living in a remote area of Scotland, multiple adaptations were made to the processes to suit the context in which Near Me at Home will be used. Learning from testing and adapting with the public will likely be useful for others embarking on codesign approaches to improve spread and sustainability of quality improvement projects.","Beattie, Michelle; Morrison, Clare; MacGilleEathain, Rebecah; Gray, Nicola; Anderson, Julie",BMJ Open Qual,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32855158/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2020-001035,21

679449,Prediction of functional class of novel viral proteins by a statistical learning method irrespective of sequence similarity,2005-01-05,"OBJECTIVES As we pass the anniversary of the declaration of a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation, it invites us to reflect upon the inescapable changes that coronavirus has wrought upon ENT and, in particular, rhinological practice. As it remains unclear when we will globally emerge from the shadow of COVID-19, a critical analysis of the evidence base on both the assessment and mitigation of risk is vital for ENT departments worldwide. This article presents a systematic review of the literature examining articles which consider either the quantification of risk or strategies to mitigate risk specifically in the setting of rhinological surgery. DESIGN Systematic literature review. RESULTS The literature search yielded a total of 3406 returns with 24 articles meeting eligibility criteria. A narrative synthesis stratified results into two broad themes: (1) those which made an assessment as to the aerosolisation of droplets during sinus surgery, further subdivided into work which considered macroscopically visible droplets and that which considered smaller particles; (2) and those studies which examined the mitigation of this risk. CONCLUSION Studies considering the aerosolisation of both droplets and smaller particles suggest endonasal surgery carries significant risk. Whilst results both highlight a range of innovative adjunctive strategies and support suction as an important variable to reduce aerosolisation, appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be considered mandatory for all healthcare professionals involved in rhinological surgery given studies have demonstrated that close adherence to PPE use is effective at preventing COVID-19 infection.","Williams, Stephen P; Leong, Samuel C",Clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ENT-UK ; official journal of Netherlands Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology & Cervico-Facial Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/coa.13854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34473910/,21

Consumers and healthcare providers, including many general practitioners, have turned to telehealth with enthusiasm. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to present evidence and analysis supporting the adoption of national telehealth standards in Australia. DISCUSSION: Despite efforts by professional organisations to develop telehealth standards, Australia lacks a national telehealth strategy and a unified set of shared standards for clinical governance and quality assurance that can be applied across the health system. To ensure consumer safety and support healthcare providers in telehealth, a national regulatory framework and telehealth standards should be established on the basis of the latest evidence on safety and quality in all forms of telehealth.","McKenzie, Rosemary; Kanhutu, Kudzai Nzenza",Aust J Gen Pract,https://doi.org/10.31128/ajgp-05-21-5967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34590087/,21

Since no evidence exists that SARS-CoV is infective before the onset of symptoms and the quarantined persons were exposed but not symptomatic, we thought the quarantine's effectiveness should be investigated. Using the Taiwan quarantine data, we found that the onset-to-diagnosis time of previously quarantined confirmed case-patients was significantly shortened compared to that for those who had not been quarantined. Thus, quarantine for SARS in Taiwan screened potentially infective persons for swift diagnosis and hospitalization after onset, thereby indirectly reducing infections. Full-scale quarantine measures implemented on April 28 led to a significant improvement in onset-to-diagnosis time of all SARS patients, regardless of previous quarantine status. We discuss the temporal effects of quarantine measures and other interventions on detection and isolation as well as the potential usefulness of quarantine in faster identification of persons with SARS and in improving isolation measures.","Hsieh, Ying-Hen; King, Chwan-Chuan; Chen, Cathy W.

PARTICIPANTS: The original SAABC comprised 449 women pregnant with an Aboriginal child recruited February 2011 to May 2012. At child age 2 years, 324 (74%) participants were retained, at age 3 years, 324 (74%) participants were retained and at age 5 years, 299 (69%) participants were retained. Fieldwork for follow-up at age 7 years is underway, with funding available for follow-up at age 9 years. FINDINGS TO DATE: At baseline, 53% of mothers were aged 14–24 years and 72% had high school or less educational attainment. At age 3 years, dental disease experience was higher among children exposed to the intervention later rather than earlier in infancy. The effect was sustained at age 5 years, but rates were still higher than general child population estimates. Experiences of racism were high among mothers, with impacts on both tooth brushing and toothache. Compared with population estimates, levels of self-efficacy and self-rated oral health of mothers at baseline were low. FUTURE PLANS: Our data have contributed to a better understanding of the environmental, behavioural, dietary, biological and psychosocial factors contributing to Aboriginal child oral and general health, and social and emotional well-being. This is beneficial in charting the trajectory of cohort participants’ health and well-being overtime, particularly in identifying antecedents of chronic diseases which are highly prevalent among Aboriginal Australians. Funding for continued follow-up of the cohort will be sought.

Infectious RNAs must also temporally control incompatible activities and rapidly complete their life cycle before being targeted by cellular defenses. Viral genomic RNAs must switch between translation and replication, and untranslated subviral RNAs must control other activities such as RNA editing or self-cleavage. Unlike well-characterized riboswitches in cellular RNAs, the control of infectious RNA activities by altering the configuration of functional RNA domains has only recently been recognized. In this review, we will present some of these molecular rearrangements found in RNA viruses, viroids and virus-associated RNAs, relating how these dynamic regions were discovered, the activities that might be regulated, and what factors or conditions might cause a switch between conformations.","Simon, Anne E.; Gehrke, Lee",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Regulatory Mechanisms,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1874939909000595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19501200/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874939909000595; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2009.05.005; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2784224?pdf=render,21

The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) and its different types among COVID-19 patients, and to check the glycemic control in diabetic cases for three months. After excluding known cases of DM, 570 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were studied. All participants were classified as non-diabetic or newly discovered diabetic. According to hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting insulin, newly discovered diabetic patients were further classified into pre-existing DM, new-onset type 1 DM, and new-onset type 2 DM. Glycemic control was monitored for three months in newly diagnosed diabetic patients. DM was diagnosed in 77 patients (13.5%); 12 (2.1%) with pre-existing DM, 7 (1.2%) with new-onset type 1 DM, and 58 (10.2%) with new-onset type 2 DM. Significantly higher rates of severe infection and mortality (p < 0.001 and p = 0.046) were evident among diabetic patients. Among survived diabetic patients (n = 63), hyperglycemia and the need for anti-diabetic treatment persisted in 73% of them for three months. COVID-19 was associated with a new-onset of DM in 11.4% of all participants and expression of pre-existing DM in 2.1% of all participants, both being associated with severe infection. COVID-19 patients with newly diagnosed diabetes had high risk of mortality.

Focusing on COVID-19-attributable mortality, we expand upon a national comparative analysis of years of potential life lost (YPLL) attributable to COVID-19 by race/ethnicity (Bassett et al., 2020), estimating percentages of total YPLL for non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, non-Hispanic Asians, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Natives, contrasting them with their respective percent population shares, as well as age-adjusted YPLL rate ratios - anchoring comparisons to non-Hispanic Whites - in each of 45 states and the District of Columbia using data from the National Center for Health Statistics as of December 30, 2020. Using a novel Monte Carlo simulation procedure to quantify estimation uncertainty, our results reveal substantial racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19-attributable YPLL across states, with a prevailing pattern of non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics experiencing disproportionately high and non-Hispanic Whites experiencing disproportionately low COVID-19-attributable YPLL. Furthermore, observed disparities are generally more pronounced when measuring mortality in terms of YPLL compared to death counts, reflecting the greater intensity of the disparities at younger ages. We also find substantial state-to-state variability in the magnitudes of the estimated racial/ethnic disparities, suggesting that they are driven in large part by social determinants of health whose degree of association with race/ethnicity varies by state.","Xu, J.

Appropriate triage and escalation of clinical care are critical for this patient group managed in community care facilities (CCFs). PURPOSE: To evaluate the imaging guideline recommendations for COVID-19 from the Fleischner Society and analyze the clinical utility of chest radiograph screening for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) who were admitted to Singapore Expo, a designated CCF, for continuation of their management during May 3-31, 2020 were identified. Upon admission, patients aged 36 and older without any baseline chest imaging received a chest radiograph. All chest radiographs and clinical outcomes of patients including those who were subsequently transferred to acute hospitals for escalation of care were reviewed. Key proportions of patients with findings of pulmonary infection and those requiring further inpatient treatment were calculated, and 95% binomial proportion confidence intervals obtained using the Clopper-Pearson method. RESULTS: The study included 5,621 patients: all men 100% (5,621/5,621), mean age 37 ± 8 years (range 17-60). A total of 1,964 chest radiographs were performed of which normal accounted for 98.0% (1,925/1,964) and findings of pulmonary infection represented 2.0% (39/1,964). Only 0.2% (4/1,964) with chest radiograph findings of pulmonary infection (all of whom were symptomatic) required supplemental oxygenation and inpatient treatment. None of the asymptomatic patients with findings of pulmonary infection required supplemental oxygenation, and they received only symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSION: In accordance with Fleischner Society recommendations, chest radiograph screening for patients with COVID-19 aged 17-60 with mild or no symptoms is not indicated unless there is risk of clinical deterioration.

The trial had 15.5% uptake and 7.9% attrition rate. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups: the intervention group (n = 61) received the PAM intervention as an adjunct to usual care; the control group (n = 40) received usual care only. At 3 months, biochemically validated medication adherence was improved by 20% (95% CI 3–36%) in the intervention than control, and systolic blood pressure was reduced by 9.16 mmHg (95% CI 5.69–12.64) in intervention than control. Improvements in medication adherence and reductions in blood pressure suggested potential intervention effectiveness.

Co-teaching may be one method for creating a collaborative environment. This pilot study designed, developed, and implemented Nurse-Doctor Co-Teaching on an inpatient medicine service. METHODS: Ten Nurse-Doctor Co-Teaching pairs designed 30-minute, structured co-teaching sessions with learning objectives, evidence-based content, interactive teaching strategies and a Take-Away of key content with the help of a coaching team. Each session was presented by a nurse and senior doctor to nurse and resident learners. Our assessment blueprint included: 1. Anonymous surveys assessing the overall rating of each session and 2. Pre- and post-anonymous surveys assessing measures of interprofessional collaboration and communication between nurses and residents before and after the series of ten co-teaching sessions. RESULTS: Data from ten post-session surveys included 121 of 156 participants (77.6%). Attendance at each session ranged from 13–19 participants with 8–17 participants completing a survey per session for an average of 12.1 surveys analyzed. All Nurse-Doctor Co-Teaching sessions scored in the excellent range between 1.00 and 1.43 on a Likert scale (1 is excellent and 5 is poor). In response to the question “What did you like best?”, interactive teaching strategies was the most frequent spontaneous answer. A significant correlation between the number of interactive teaching strategies and enjoyability of the session (p-value=0.01) was observed. Measures of interprofessional collaboration and communication did not change significantly in the pre-intervention compared to post-intervention period. CONCLUSION: We created a unique model of interprofessional co-teaching on an inpatient service. The overall excellent ratings of our interactive sessions indicate that Nurse-Doctor Co-Teaching is a valued form of learning. Our structured format is adaptable to various medical settings and could be expanded to include additional allied health professionals. We plan further studies to assess if Nurse-Doctor Co-Teaching improves measures of interprofessional collaboration.","Zambrotta, Marina E; Aylward, Patricia; Roy, Christopher L; Piper-Vallillo, Emily; Pelletier, Stephen R; Honan, James P; Heller, Noah; Ramani, Subha; Shields, Helen M",Adv Med Educ Pract,https://doi.org/10.2147/amep.s300231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33889044/,21

This study aims to evaluate the effect of these measures on paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in terms of acute metabolic complications and shortages in insulin and glucose measuring supplies. It also evaluates the caregivers’ perceptions of the use of telemedicine during the lockdown. Methods This is a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study. It was completed using Google forms and patients / caregivers were asked to consent if they agreed to answer. Results 235 patients/families participated in the study. The mean age of the patients was 10.8 years ± 3.9 years (N=229). Twenty-four children (10.2%) needed to visit the emergency department during the lockdown period which lasted for 10 weeks. Of these, eight (3.4%) were hospitalized due to acute metabolic complications. Families (58.3 %) faced insulin shortages and 14% had to ration insulin, i.e., decrease the dose, during the lockdown. Glucose monitoring strips were rationed by 43.4% of families leading to more frequent low / high glucose readings in 75.5% of children of these families. Telemedicine using phones and social media applications was utilized for communication with healthcare professionals and continuing medical care. Most of the participants (85.5 %) described it as a smooth and positive experience. Conclusions The extreme lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic caused insulin and glucose measuring equipment shortages in children with diabetes in Jordan.

Here, we examine three topics rooted in biology and biomedicine—creationism, harms from tobacco, and opioid addiction—to show that those purveying misinformation employ a consistent pattern of intellectual dishonesty to delegitimize science that challenges their ideological positions.

STUDY DESIGN: Multi-method longitudinal study involving ethnographic observation, semi-structured interviews, self-report questionnaires, and clinical information. Twenty fathers of preterm infants hospitalized in a level-III-NICU were included. Data were analyzed using thematic continent analysis. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified: support for mother (subthemes: putting mother’s and infant’s needs first; hiding worries and negative emotions; counteracting the sense of guilt; fear that the mother would reject the child), mother’s care for the infant (subthemes: observing mother engaged in caregiving; mother has “something extra”), and couple relationship (subthemes: collaboration; bond). CONCLUSION: Fathers supporting their partners during the stay in the NICU experience emotional distress and the need for being supported that often are hidden. This demands a great deal of emotional and physical energy.","Stefana, Alberto; Biban, Paolo; Padovani, Ezio Maria; Lavelli, Manuela",J Perinatol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41372-021-01195-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34471215/,21

Organ transplant recipients being at a risk for more severe COVID-19 if they get SARS CoV-2 viral infection, COVID-19 vaccine has a significant role in these patients. The vaccine is a safer way to help build protection and would either prevent COVID-19 infection or at least diminish the severity of the disease. It would also reduce the risk of the continuing transmission and enhance herd immunity. Immuno-compromised patients should not receive live vaccines as they can cause vaccine-related disease and hence the guidelines suggest that all transplant recipients should receive age-appropriate 'inactivated vaccine' as recommended for general population. Though trials have not been undertaken on transplant recipients, efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccine have been scientifically documented for few vaccines among the general population.","Kute, Vivek B; Agarwal, Sanjay K; Prakash, Jai; Guleria, Sandeep; Shroff, Sunil; Sharma, Ashish; Varma, Prem; Prasad, Narayan; Sahay, Manisha; Gupta, Subhash; Sudhindran, S; Krishan, Kewal; Ramesh, Vasanthi; Kumar, Sunil",Indian J Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34267426/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijn.ijn_64_21,21

OBJECTIVES: Research questions were: 1) How well does the WURSS-21 assess the symptoms and functional impairments associated with common cold? 2) How well can this instrument measure change over time (responsiveness)? 3) What is the minimal important difference (MID) that can be detected by the WURSS-21? 4) What are the descriptive statistics for area under the time severity curve (AUC)? 5) What sample sizes would trials require to detect MID or AUC criteria? 6) What does factor analysis tell us about the underlying dimensional structure of the common cold? 7) How reliable are items, domains, and summary scores represented in WURSS? 8) For each of these considerations, how well does the WURSS-21 compare to the WURSS-44, Jackson, and SF-8? STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: People with Jackson-defined colds were recruited from the community in and around Madison, Wisconsin. Participants were enrolled within 48 hours of first cold symptom and monitored for up to 14 days of illness. Half the sample filled out the WURSS-21 in the morning and the WURSS-44 in the evening, with the other half reversing the daily order. External comparators were the SF-8, a 24-hour recall general health measure yielding separate physical and mental health scores, and the eight-item Jackson cold index, which assesses symptoms, but not functional impairment or quality of life. RESULTS: In all, 230 participants were monitored for 2,457 person-days. Participants were aged 14 to 83 years (mean 34.1, SD 13.6), majority female (66.5%), mostly white (86.0%), and represented substantive education and income diversity. WURSS-21 items demonstrated similar performance when embedded within the WURSS-44 or in the stand-alone WURSS-21. Minimal important difference (MID) and Guyatt's responsiveness index were 10.3, 0.71 for the WURSS-21 and 18.5, 0.75 for the WURSS-44. Factorial analysis suggested an eight dimension structure for the WURSS-44 and a three dimension structure for the WURSS-21, with composite reliability coefficients ranging from 0.87 to 0.97, and Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.76 to 0.96. Both WURSS versions correlated significantly with the Jackson scale (W-21 R = 0.85; W-44 R = 0.88), with the SF-8 physical health (W-21 R = -0.79; W-44 R = -0.80) and SF-8 mental health (W-21 R = -0.55; W-44 R = -0.60). CONCLUSION: The WURSS-44 and WURSS-21 perform well as illness-specific quality-of-life evaluative outcome instruments. Construct validity is supported by the data presented here. While the WURSS-44 covers more symptoms, the WURSS-21 exhibits similar performance in terms of reliability, responsiveness, importance-to-patients, and convergence with other measures.","Barrett, Bruce; Brown, Roger L; Mundt, Marlon P; Thomas, Gay R; Barlow, Shari K; Highstrom, Alex D; Bahrainian, Mozhdeh",Health Qual Life Outcomes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19674476/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7525-7-76,21
684562,Assembly of Viruses: Enveloped Particles,2008-12-31,"BACKGROUND: A new variant of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7, emerged as the dominant cause of COVID-19 disease in the UK from November, 2020. We report a post-hoc analysis of the efficacy of the adenoviral vector vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), against this variant. METHODS: Volunteers (aged ≥18 years) who were enrolled in phase 2/3 vaccine efficacy studies in the UK, and who were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or a meningococcal conjugate control (MenACWY) vaccine, provided upper airway swabs on a weekly basis and also if they developed symptoms of COVID-19 disease (a cough, a fever of 37·8°C or higher, shortness of breath, anosmia, or ageusia). Swabs were tested by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for SARS-CoV-2 and positive samples were sequenced through the COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium. Neutralising antibody responses were measured using a live-virus microneutralisation assay against the B.1.1.7 lineage and a canonical non-B.1.1.7 lineage (Victoria). The efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a NAAT positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to vaccine received. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1 − relative risk (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vs MenACWY groups) derived from a robust Poisson regression model. This study is continuing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137. FINDINGS: Participants in efficacy cohorts were recruited between May 31 and Nov 13, 2020, and received booster doses between Aug 3 and Dec 30, 2020. Of 8534 participants in the primary efficacy cohort, 6636 (78%) were aged 18–55 years and 5065 (59%) were female. Between Oct 1, 2020, and Jan 14, 2021, 520 participants developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1466 NAAT positive nose and throat swabs were collected from these participants during the trial. Of these, 401 swabs from 311 participants were successfully sequenced. Laboratory virus neutralisation activity by vaccine-induced antibodies was lower against the B.1.1.7 variant than against the Victoria lineage (geometric mean ratio 8·9, 95% CI 7·2–11·0). Clinical vaccine efficacy against symptomatic NAAT positive infection was 70·4% (95% CI 43·6–84·5) for B.1.1.7 and 81·5% (67·9–89·4) for non-B.1.1.7 lineages. INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed reduced neutralisation activity against the B.1.1.7 variant compared with a non-B.1.1.7 variant in vitro, but the vaccine showed efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2.

685033,Hidden Costs of Biodefense Research,2005-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 outbreak, four cities -- Wuhan, Beijing, Urumqi and Dalian -- have experienced the process from outbreak to stabilization. Geographic location, population density, population mobility and epidemic prevention measures show relatively large differences among the four regions of interest, providing the possibility to use these regional conventional attributes and pathological infectious disease attributes to assess the risk of an infectious disease outbreak in an area. METHODS: According to the China Statistical Yearbook and China Center for Disease Control records, regional, pathological, medical and response attributes were selected as regional vulnerability factors of infectious diseases. Then the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was used to build a regional vulnerability index model for the infectious disease. RESULTS: The influence of the COVID-19 outbreak at a certain place was assessed computationally in terms of the number of days of epidemic duration and cumulative number of infections, and then fitted to the city data. The resulting correlation coefficient was 0.999952. The range of the regional vulnerability index for COVID-19 virus was from 0.0513 to 0.9379. The vulnerability indexes of Wuhan, Urumqi, Beijing and Dalian were 0.8733, 0.1951, 0.1566 and 0.1119, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of understanding of the virus became the biggest breakthrough point for the rapid spread of the virus in Wuhan. Due to inadequate prevention and control measures, the city of Urumqi was unable to trace the source of infection and close contacts, resulting in a relatively large impact. Beijing has both high population density and migration rate, which imply that the disease outbreak in this city had a great impact. Dalian has perfect prevention and good regional attributes. In addition, the regional vulnerability index model was used to analyze other Chinese cities. Accordingly, the regional vulnerability index and the prevention and control suggestions for them were discussed.","Gao, Zekun; Jiang, Yutong; He, Junyu; Wu, Jiaping; Xu, Jian; Christakos, George",J Infect Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034121002537; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034121002537?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.09.002,21

This study aimed to conduct a survey on the effects of COVID-19 on the capacity to perform gastrointestinal motility tests in Asian countries compared with European countries. Methods: We used the questionnaire previously established by our team for researchers in European countries. The correlation between the decreased rate of gastrointestinal motility and function tests, and the infection/mortality rates of COVID-19 and stringency of a government’s interventions in each country was analysed and protective measures were assessed. Results: In total, 58 gastroenterologists/motility experts in Asian countries responded to this survey. The infection/mortality rates of COVID-19 and Stringency Index had a significant impact on the testing capacity of oesophageal manometry and catheter-based pH monitoring. In European countries, most facilities used filtering facepiece 2/3 (FFP2/3) masks during oesophageal motility studies. Meanwhile, in Asian countries, most facilities used surgical masks.

We searched the keywords from PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE on August 14, 2020. The pooled effects and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated by Stata 11.2. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to explore the source of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis was implemented to assess the stability of the results. Begg’s test and Egger’s test were conducted to assess the publication bias. Sixteen articles with 8752 COVID-19 patients were finally included in the meta-analysis. The results based on random-effects model indicated that elevated value of IL-6 was significantly associated with adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (pooled effect = 1.21, 95% CI 1.13–1.31, I(2) = 90.7%). Subgroup analysis stratified by disease outcomes showed consistent results (severe: pooled effect = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05–1.31; ICU (intensive care unit) admission: pooled effect = 1.90, 95% CI 1.04–3.47; death: pooled effect = 3.57, 95% CI 2.10–6.07). Meta-regression indicated that study design was a source of heterogeneity. Publication bias was existent in our analysis (Begg’s test: P = 0.007; Egger’s test: P < 0.001).

688281,"First report of feline bocavirus associated with severe enteritis of cat in Northeast China, 2015",2018-02-20,"Abstract The effect of tunicamycin and monensin on the biosynthesis, intracellular transport, and maturation of bovine herpesvirus type-1 (BHV-1) glycoproteins was examined. Tunicamycin completely inhibited the production of infectious virus particles and significantly reduced the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into viral glycoproteins. In the presence of monensin, reduced amounts of infectious virus particles were produced, which was mainly due to inhibition of virus release, rather than virus production. Monensin only slightly inhibited viral glycoprotein synthesis. The effects of these compounds on infectivity indicated that glycosylation is required for the production of infectious virus, though complete processing of the glycoproteins is not essential. In addition, egress of the virions from infected cells probably requires a functional Golgi complex. In the presence of tunicamycin or monensin various degrees of glycosylation of the major glycoproteins occurred, consequently their rates of migration differed from that of the normal glycoproteins. Tunicamycin completely blocked glycosylation of GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7. In contrast, GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b were partially glycosyaated in the presence of tunicamycin. These results indicated that GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7 are N-linked glycoproteins, but GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b contain both N- and O-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Tunicamycin blocked the transport of all viral glycoproteins to the cell surface, suggesting that glycosylation is required for this process. In the presence of monensin, the viral glycoproteins were transported and expressed on the cell surface indicating that transport does not require complete processing of the glycoproteins and may occur via a Golgi-independent pathway. In addition, monensin-treated BHV-1 infected cells could act as target cells in an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity assay. Thus, complete glycosylation may not be essential for maintenance of antigenicity and participation in immune destruction.","Van Drunen Littel-Van Den Hurk, Sylvia; Babiuki, L.

But the information about cardiac consequences of COVID-19 after recovery is limited. The aim of the study was comprehensive echocardiography assessment of right ventricular (RV) in patients recovered from COVID-19. This is a prospective, single-center study. After recovery from COVID-19, echocardiography was performed in consecutive 79 patients that attended follow-up visits from July 15 to November 30, 2020. According to the recovery at home vs hospital, patients were divided into two groups: home recovery (n = 43) and hospital recovery (n = 36). Comparisons were made with age, sex and risk factor-matched control group (n = 41). In addition to conventional echocardiography parameters, RV global longitudinal strain (RV-GLS) and RV free wall strain (RV-FWS) were determined using 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D STE). Of the 79 patients recovered from COVID-19, 43 (55%) recovered at home, while 36 (45%) required hospitalization. The median follow-up duration was 133 ± 35 (87–184) days.

We demonstrated subclinic dysfunction of RV by 2D-STE in hospitalized patients in relation to the severity of pneumonia after recovery from COVID-19. 2D-STE supplies additional information above standard measures of RV in this cohort and can be used in the follow-up of these patients.","Ozer, Pelin Karaca; Govdeli, Elif Ayduk; Baykiz, Derya; Karaayvaz, Ekrem Bilal; Medetalibeyoglu, Alpay; Catma, Yunus; Elitok, Ali; Cagatay, Atahan; Umman, Berrin; Oncul, Aytac; Tukek, Tufan; Bugra, Zehra",Int J Cardiovasc Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33839981/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10554-021-02214-2,21
690690,Host receptors: the key to establishing cells with broad viral tropism for vaccine production,2020-03-23,"Efficient translational bypassing of a 50 nt non-coding gap in a phage T4 topoisomerase subunit gene (gp60) requires several recoding signals. Here we investigate the function of the mRNA stem loop 5′ of the take-off codon, as well as the importance of ribosome loading density on the mRNA for efficient bypassing. We show that polysomes are less efficient at mediating bypassing than monosomes, both in vitro and in vivo, due to their preventing formation of a stem loop 5′ of the take-off codon and allowing greater peptidyl-tRNA drop off. A ribosome profiling analysis of phage T4 infected E. coli yielded protected mRNA fragments within the normal size range derived from ribosomes stalled at the take-off codon. However, ribosomes at this position also yielded some 53 nucleotide fragments, 16 longer. These were due to protection of the nucleotides that form the 5′ stem loop. NMR shows that the 5′ stem loop is highly dynamic. The importance of different nucleotides in the 5′ stem loop is revealed by mutagenesis studies. These data highlight the significance of the 5′ stem loop for the 50 nt bypassing, and further enhance appreciation of relevance of the extent of ribosome loading for recoding.","O'Loughlin, Sinéad; Capece, Mark C.; Klimova, Mariia; Wills, Norma M.; Coakley, Arthur; Samatova, Ekaterina; O'Connor, Patrick B.F.; Loughran, Gary; Weissman, Jonathan S.; Baranov, Pavel V.; Rodnina, Marina V.; Puglisi, Joseph D.; Atkins, John F.",J Mol Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283620303466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32454154/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.05.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283620303466?v=s5,21
