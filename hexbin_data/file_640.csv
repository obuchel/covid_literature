12765,12765,12765,Tumor-suppressive function and mechanism of HOXB13 in right-sided colon cancer,8.437952,10.301506,2019-11-29,"The impact of ultramarathons (UM) on the organs, especially in professional athletes, is poorly understood. We tested a 36-year-old UM male runner before and after winning a 24-h marathon. The primary goal of the study was cardiovascular assessment. The athlete experienced right knee pain for the first time after 12 h of running (approximately 130 km), which intensified, affecting his performance. The competitors ran on a 1984 m rectangle-loop (950 × 42 m) in an atypical clockwise fashion. The winner completed 516 rectangular corners. Right knee Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) one day after the run showed general overload in addition to degenerative as well as specific features associated with “turning to the right”. Re-examination after three years revealed none of these findings. Different kinds of overloading of the right lower limb, including right knee pain, were indicated in 6 of 10 competitors from the top 20, including a woman who set the world record. The affected competitors suggested as cause for discomfort the shape of the loop and running direction. They believed that changing the direction of the run during the competition and an athletics stadium loop shape on a 2000–2500 m length is better for 24-h UM runners. In the absence of technical alternatives, the “necessary evil” is a counterclockwise run (also Association of Athletics Federations IAAF recommendation). Results suggest that a one-way, clockwise, 24-h UM run had an adverse effect on the athlete’s right knee, as a result of unsymmetrical load. Organizers of 24-h UM runs should consider the shape of the competition loop and apply the principle of uniform load on the musculoskeletal system (alternate directions run). In case of technical impossibility, it would be better to run counterclockwise, which is more common, preferred by runners, and recommended by the IAAF.","Gajda, Robert; Walasek, Paweł; Jarmuszewski, Maciej",Int J Environ Res Public Health,640,1

METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed within a EULAR taskforce on the assessment of competences in rheumatology training and other related specialities (July 2019). Two searches were performed: one search for rheumatology and one for related medical specialities. Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies and extracted data on assessment methods. Risk of bias was assessed using the medical education research study quality instrument. RESULTS: Of 7335 articles in rheumatology and 2324 reviews in other specialities, 5 and 31 original studies were included, respectively. Studies in rheumatology were at variable risk of bias and explored only direct observation of practical skills (DOPS) and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). OSCEs, including clinical, laboratory and imaging stations, performed best, with a good to very good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α=0.83–0.92), and intrarater reliability (r=0.80–0.95). OSCEs moderately correlated with other assessment tools: r=0.48 vs rating by programme directors; r=0.2–0.44 vs multiple-choice questionnaires; r=0.48 vs DOPS. In other specialities, OSCEs on clinical skills had a good to very good inter-rater reliability and OSCEs on communication skills demonstrated a good to very good internal consistency. Multisource feedback and the mini-clinical evaluation exercise showed good feasibility and internal consistency (reliability), but other data on validity and reliability were conflicting. CONCLUSION: Despite consistent data on competence assessment in other specialities, evidence in rheumatology is scarce and conflicting. Overall, OSCEs seem an appropriate tool to assess the competence of clinical skills and correlate well with other assessment strategies. DOPS, multisource feedback and the mini-clinical evaluation exercise are feasible alternatives.","Alunno, Alessia; Najm, Aurélie; Sivera, Francisca; Haines, Catherine; Falzon, Louise; Ramiro, Sofia",RMD Open,640,1

Given the well-established association between income and health, this increasing income gap may provide insights into the dynamics of cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden among adults in the US. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the contribution of people in the highest-resources group and the remainder of the population to the burden of CVD, and to estimate the trends in the prevalence of CVD for the 2 groups in the United States from 1999 to 2016. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This serial cross-sectional analysis used nationally representative data from 9 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2016. Survey participants were adults 20 years or older. Statistical analysis of the data was conducted in December 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age-standardized prevalence of CVD was calculated using the 2010 census estimates. Participants were stratified by income group using the NHANES income to poverty ratio, which was converted into a binary variable: a ratio of 5 or greater for the highest-resources group and a ratio of less than 5 for the remainder of the population. RESULTS: This analysis included 44 986 participants. Among the 7926 participants in the highest-resources group, 3290 (50.3%) were in the 40- to 59-year age group and 4094 (51.9%) were men. Among the 37 060 participants in the remainder of the population, 10 840 (34.1%) were in the 40- to 59-year age group and 19 470 (53.2%) were women. The age-standardized prevalence of CVD decreased in the highest-resources group during the study period (1999-2016): angina from 3.4% (n = 24) to 0.3% (n = 5), heart attack from 3.2% (n = 24) to 1.4% (n = 19), congestive heart failure (CHF) from 1.2% (n = 11) to 0.5% (n = 7), and stroke from 1.1% to 1.0% (n = 8). In the remainder of the population, the prevalence of angina decreased from 3.3% (n = 131) in 1999 to 2.6% (n = 118) in 2016 and heart attack from 4.0% (n = 160) in 1999 to 3.6% (n = 201) in 2016. Conversely, an increase was observed in the prevalence of CHF from 2.6% (n = 123) in 1999 to 2.8% (n = 176) in 2016 and stroke from 2.9% (n = 152) in 1999 to 3.2% (n = 178) in 2016. Over time, the odds of reporting angina (odds ratio [OR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73-0.87; P < .001), heart attack (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.97; P = .003), and CHF (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99; P = .03) decreased among those in the highest-resources group, while there was no significant change in the odds of reporting stroke (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90-1.05; P = .43). Among the remainder of the population, the odds of reporting angina (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99; P < .05) and heart attack (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97-1.02; P = .06) decreased over time. Conversely, there was no statistically significant change in the odds of reporting CHF (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05; P = .08) and stroke (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.99-1.04; P = .21). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found substantial and increasing disparities in CVD prevalence between the richest and poorest participants in the NHANES from 1999 to 2016, with lower CVD rate reported among the highest-resources group. Additional research into the dynamics of income inequality and health outcomes as well as policy and public health efforts to mitigate this inequality are needed.","Abdalla, Salma M.; Yu, Shui; Galea, Sandro",JAMA Netw Open,640,1

METHOD: This was a prospective observational study. Flexible bronchoscopy was done in eligible patients with failure of extubation form invasive ventilation. The main outcome measure was to find the presence of any anatomic or dynamic abnormalities of the airways of these patients and the organism profile of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. RESULTS: Forty-eight babies (68.8% preterm) were enrolled in the study. The most common finding on bronchoscopy was airway edema seen in 13 (27%) patients. BAL culture was positive in 29 (74%) patients. Overall treatment was modified in 35 (73%) patients based on bronchoscopy findings/BAL culture. Majority of infants (83.3%) tolerated the procedure very well. CONCLUSION: Flexible bronchoscopy provides useful information in the management of newborn babies with extubation failure.,"Bhat, Javeed Iqbal; Charoo, Bashir A.; Zahoor, Shihab; Ahmad, Qazi Iqbal; Ahangar, Ambreen Ali",Indian Pediatr,640,1

Marcol 52 and #10 white oil are mineral-based adjuvants and can be found in commercial inactivated ND virus vaccines. The present study demonstrated that a vegetable origin oil E515-D had lower polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and higher flash point than the commercial products Marcol 52 and #10 white oil. E515-D could be mixed with an aqueous phase containing ND virus antigen to form a stable water-in-oil vaccine emulsion and exhibited more potent adjuvant effects on the immune response than Marcol 52 and #10 white oil. Moreover, the absorption of E515-D–adjuvanted vaccine was faster than absorption of Marcol 52- and #10 white oil-adjuvanted vaccines when ND virus vaccines were injected in broilers. Therefore, E515-D was safe and could be a suitable adjuvant used in vaccines for food animals. In addition，E515-D is not easy to be flammable during shipping and storage owing to its higher flash point.","Yuan, L.; Wang, Y.; Li, Z.; Ma, X.; Cui, X.; Chi, X.; Xu, W.; Hu, S.",Poult Sci,640,1

OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in the size of surgical practices, market-level factors associated with this consolidation, and how place of service for surgical care delivery varies by practice size. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study of Medicare Data on Provider Practice and Specialty from January 1 to December 31, 2013, compared with January 1 to December 31, 2017, was conducted on all general surgeon practices caring for patients enrolled in Medicare in the US. Data analysis was performed from November 4, 2019, to January 9, 2020. EXPOSURES: Practice sizes in 2013 and 2017 were compared relative to hospital market concentration measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index in the hospital referral region. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in size of surgical practices over the study period. Secondary outcomes included change in surgical practice market concentration and the place of service for provision of surgical care stratified by surgical practice size. RESULTS: From 2013 to 2017, the number of surgical practices in the US decreased from 10 432 to 8451. The proportion of surgeons decreased in practices with 1 (from 26.2% to 17.4%), 2 (from 8.3% to 6.6%), and 3 to 5 (from 18.0% to 16.5%) surgeons, and the proportion of surgeons in practices with 6 or more surgeons increased (from 47.6% to 59.5%). Hospital concentration was associated with an increase in the size of the surgical practice. Each 10% increase in the hospital market concentration was associated with an increase of 0.204 surgeons (95% CI, 0.020-0.388 surgeons; P = .03) per practice from 2013 to 2017. Similarly, a 10% increase in the hospital-level HHI was associated with an increase in the surgical practice HHI of 0.023 (95% CI, 0.013-0.033; P < .001). Large surgical practices increased their share of Medicare services provided from 36.5% in 2013 to 45.6% in 2017. Large practices (31.3% inpatient in 2013 to 33.1% in 2017) were much more likely than small practices (19.0% inpatient in 2013 to 17.7% in 2017) to be based in hospital settings and this gap widened over time. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Surgeons have increasingly joined larger practices over time, and there has been a significant decrease in solo, small, and midsize surgical practices. The consolidation of surgeons into larger practices appears to be associated with hospital market concentration in the same market. Although overall care appears to be more hospital based for larger practices, the association between the consolidation of surgical practices and patient access and outcomes should be studied.","Tsai, Thomas C.; Jacobson, Benjamin H.; Benjamin, Evan M.; Figueroa, Jose F.",JAMA Netw Open,640,11

One-child families are one of these patterns that is caused by a set of factors and one of these factors is the fear of re-pregnancy. In this regard, this study aimed to use a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program to reduce the fear of women who have been experiencing anxiety after their first pregnancy and delivery. Materials and methods: This interventional study was conducted on 67 one-child women, who at least 6 years have been passed since the birth of their child and according to the short form of the Pregnancy Related Anxiety Questionnaire (PRAQ-17), have been experienced anxiety. These women were randomly divided into control and intervention groups. For the intervention group, the MBSR program was conducted in 8 sessions, once every week, each session lasting 2.5 hours. At the end of the program, a second PRAQ-17 was completed by both groups. Results: The findings showed that the MBSR approach in the intervention group significantly decreased the anxiety score in total (p=0.001) and individually in all subcategories. Conclusion: The MBSR approach can reduce the anxiety of one-child women who have experienced anxiety after their pregnancy and childbirth. Thus, using this method in helping women with pregnancy-related anxiety is recommended to increase the birth rate.","Malekpoorafshar, Mojgan; Salehinejad, Parvin; Pouya, Fatemeh; Khezri Moghadam, Noshiravan; Shahesmaeili, Armita",J Family Reprod Health,640,8

The two areas were compared regarding the number of respiratory disease outbreaks in fattening pigs on each farm per year with a multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering. The two areas exhibited different typologies: in the DPPA, high density was associated with a high proportion of finishing-pig units resulting in much moving of piglets within the area. Farrow-to-finish farms located in the DPPA had many contacts with external vehicles; this was associated with more than two respiratory disease outbreaks per farm per year. There also was a lack of biosecurity measures implemented on these farms. Conversely, the good health situation of the farms located in the SPPA was associated with few external contacts and good biosecurity measures. In a second step, risk factors for the occurrence of more than 2 respiratory outbreaks per year were studied. Having more than 4 pig farms within a 2 km radius area, more than 30 incoming rendering trucks per year, and storage of the carcasses of dead animals within the farm yard perimeter increased the risk of occurrence of more than 2 respiratory disease outbreaks per year on the farm. This risk was also increased when there were more than 2 animal-transport lorries entering the farm per month and more than 1 veterinarian's or technician's vehicle coming in every 2 months. These results were discussed because of possible bias due to the retrospective design of the survey and the sampling scheme (randomisation within two areas).","Rose, Nicolas; Madec, François",Veterinary research,640,31

In order to establish the polarity of entry and release of CCoV from epithelial cells, the interactions of the virus with A72 and CrFK cells grown on permeable supports was evaluated, and the amount of infective virus in the apical and in the basolateral media was determined and compared. Infection of A72 cells after different times post seeding demonstrated that CCoV grow after infection from both apical and basolateral sides. In CrFK cells, CCoV was observed in both compartments only in the later phase of the infection. To establish the reciprocal binding of CCoV on plasma membrane, A72 cells on a permeable support were preincubated with a mAb specific for CCoV. Infection from the apical side was blocked by mAb applied to that side; in contrast, such treatment on the basolateral side had no effect on the infectious process. Similarly, the low levels of CCoV observed after basolateral exposure to virus was abolished following mAb treatment of that side. The identification of CCoV into the basolateral medium could play an important role in the viral pathogenesis.","Pratelli, Annamaria",The new microbiologica,640,20

However, the precise characteristics of position marking have remained largely elusive. Recent studies have shown that space is involved in marking serial position of items in verbal working memory (WM). Furthermore, it has been suggested, but not proven, that accessing these items involves horizontal shifts of spatial attention. We used continuous electroencephalography recordings to show that memory search in serial order verbal WM involves spatial attention processes that share the same electrophysiological signatures as those operating on the visuospatial WM and external space. Accessing an item from a sequence in verbal WM induced posterior ""early directing attention negativity"" and ""anterior directing attention negativity"" contralateral to the position of the item in mental space (i.e., begin items on the left; end items on the right). In the frequency domain, we observed posterior alpha suppression contralateral to the position of the item. Our results provide clear evidence for the involvement of spatial attention in retrieving serial information from verbal WM.

However, these models often remain limited due to their contamination with non-human animal-derived components. As such, there is a need for a major shift to entirely xenofree methodologies so experimental conditions are free of non-human animal contaminants. Here, we evaluate the availability of xenofree stem cell lines and the extent of xenogenicity in major public sources of AD and control cell lines that could also be used in COVID-19 iPSC-related research. In order to assess the extent of xenogenicity, we analyzed three primary catalogs of stem cell repositories for AD and control cell lines. The iPSC catalogs were chosen based on their efforts to create accessible, high quality cell lines and recognition of the need to improve reproducibility in stem cell research. These public collections included the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), and the European Bank for induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (EBiSC). Over 300 cell lines were reviewed in this study. Although all cells were obtained from human donors, none of the collections were determined to meet fully verifiable xenofree criteria. A large numbers of cell lines were generated with one or more known xenogenic components (e.g., fetal bovine serum, Matrigel). Others lines were classified as 'suspected exposure to xenogenic components', based on the composition of the culture reagent and/or lack of manufacturer product information to verify whether animal-free reagents were used (e.g., Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium). Even CIRM, a repository clearly dedicated to producing xenofree cell lines, included Vitronectin (VTN-N) Recombinant Human Protein that was manufactured using Casein Peptone Type I derived from bovine milk. The results show that major stem cell collections -- despite substantial efforts to improve accessibility, consistency and reproducibility -- either fail to be xenofree or make it difficult to establish truly xenofree research conditions. The absence of xenofree resources fundamentally undermines the clinical, scientific and ethical integrity of stem cell research and raises specific concerns for readiness to study AD and COVID-19 using iPSCs. There is a clear need for xenofree sources, not only for clinical applications but also for the discovery and testing phases of research. This will likely require the development of open and transparent xenofree certification. By establishing truly xenofree research criteria, the field can build a foundation for accurately and effectively studying conditions that affect large parts of the population, including AD and COVID-19. Xenofree conditions for the study of long-term sequelae will be important in COVID-19 research as sources for iPSC cells from recovered and vaccinated individuals become available.

This paper identifies the impact of the pandemic and the effectiveness of government policies on human mobility by analyzing multiple datasets available at both macro and micro levels for the New York City. Using data sources related to population density, aggregated population mobility, public rail transit use, vehicle use, hotspot and non-hotspot movement patterns, and human activity agglomeration, we analyzed the inter-borough and intra-borough moment for New York City by aggregating the data at the borough level. We also assessed the internodal population movement amongst hotspot and non-hotspot points of interest for the month of March and April 2020. Results indicate a drop of about 80% in people's mobility in the city, beginning in mid-March. The movement to and from Manhattan showed the most disruption for both public transit and road traffic. The city saw its first case on March 1, 2020, but disruptions in mobility can be seen only after the second week of March when the shelter in place orders was put in effect. Owing to people working from home and adhering to stay-at-home orders, Manhattan saw the largest disruption to both inter- and intra-borough movement. But the risk of spread of infection in Manhattan turned out to be high because of higher hotspot-linked movements. The stay-at-home restrictions also led to an increased population density in Brooklyn and Queens as people were not commuting to Manhattan. Insights obtained from this study would help policymakers better understand human behavior and their response to the news and governmental policies.","Rajput, Akhil Anil; Li, Qingchun; Gao, Xinyu; Mostafavi, Ali",,640,32

Maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was initially deemed uncertain; however, recently a few cases of vertical transmission have been reported. The intrauterine mechanisms, besides direct vertical transmission, leading to the perinatal adverse outcomes are not well understood. METHODS: Multiple maternal, placental, and neonatal swabs were collected for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Serology of immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 was tested in maternal, umbilical cord, and neonatal blood. Placental examination included immunohistochemical investigation against SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression, with SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in situ hybridization and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: RT-qPCRs of the oropharynx, maternal blood, vagina, placenta, and urine were all positive over a period of 6 days, while breast milk, feces, and all neonatal samples tested negative. Placental findings showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles with generalized inflammation characterized by histiocytic intervillositis with diffuse perivillous fibrin depositions with damage to the syncytiotrophoblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Placental infection by SARS-CoV-2 leads to fibrin depositions hampering fetal-maternal gas exchange with resulting fetal distress necessitating a premature emergency cesarean section. Postpartum, the neonate showed a fetal or pediatric inflammatory multisystem-like syndrome with coronary artery ectasia temporarily associated with SARS-CoV-2 for which admittance and care on the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were required, despite being negative for SARS-CoV-2. This highlights the need for awareness of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes during the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, especially considering that the majority of pregnant women appear asymptomatic.","Schoenmakers, Sam; Snijder, Pauline; Verdijk, Robert M; Kuiken, Thijs; Kamphuis, Sylvia S M; Koopman, Laurens P; Krasemann, Thomas B; Rousian, Melek; Broekhuizen, Michelle; Steegers, Eric A P; Koopmans, Marion P G; Fraaij, Pieter L A; Reiss, Irwin K M",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,640,32

This homology allows robust insights to be gained into pathophysiologic mechanisms and therapeutic targets for the heterogeneous class of primary mitochondrial diseases through the study of diverse in vitro cellular and in vivo animal models. Dramatic advances in genetic technologies, ranging from RNA interference to achieve graded knock-down of gene expression to CRISPR/Cas-based gene editing that yields a stable gene knock-out or targeted mutation knock-in, have enabled the ready establishment of mitochondrial disease models for a plethora of individual nuclear gene disorders. These models are complemented and extended by the use of pharmacologic inhibitor-based stressors to characterize variable degrees, onset, duration, and combinations of acute on chronic mitochondrial dysfunction in individual respiratory chain enzyme complexes or distinct biochemical pathways in mitochondria. Herein is described the rationale for, and progress made in, ""therapeutic cross-training"", a novel approach meant to improve the validity and rigor of experimental conclusions when testing therapies by studying treatment effects in multiple, evolutionarily-distinct species, including C. elegans (invertebrate, worm), D. rerio (vertebrate, zebrafish), M. musculus (mammal, mouse), and/or human patient primary fibroblast cell line models of primary mitochondrial disease. The goal of these pre-clinical studies is to identify lead therapies from candidate molecules or library screens that consistently demonstrate efficacy, with minimal toxicity, in specific subtypes of mitochondrial disease. Conservation of in vitro and in vivo therapeutic effects of lead molecules across species has proven extensive, where molar concentrations found to be toxic or efficacious in one species are often consistent with therapeutic effects at similar doses seen in other mitochondrial disease models. Phenotypic outcome studies in all models are prioritized at the level of survival and function, to reflect the ultimate goal of developing highly potent therapies for human mitochondrial disease. Lead compounds that demonstrate significant benefit on gross phenotypes may be further scrutinized in these same models to decipher their cellular targets, mechanism(s), and detailed biochemical effects. High-throughput, automated technologic advances will be discussed that enable efficient, parallel screening in a diverse mitochondrial disease disorders and overarching subclasses of compounds, concentrations, libraries, and combinations. Overall, this therapeutic cross-training approach has proven valuable to identify compounds with optimal potency and safety profiles among major biochemical subtypes or specific genetic etiologies of mitochondrial disease. This approach further supports rational prioritization of lead compounds, target concentrations, and specific disease phenotypes, outcomes, and subgroups to optimally inform the design of clinical trials that test their efficacy in human mitochondrial disease subjects.

Its role as a tool of communication by the Public Health Departments in the U.S. remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social media following of the Public Health Departments of the 50 States of the U.S. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected by visiting the Public Health Department web page for each social media platform. State-level demographics were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention was utilized to collect information regarding the Governance of each State's Public Health Department. Health rankings were collected from ""America's Health Rankings"" 2019 Annual report from the United Health Foundation. The U.S. News and World Report Education Rankings were utilized to provide information regarding the public education of each State. EXPOSURE: Data were pulled on 3 separate dates: first on March 5th (baseline and pre-national emergency declaration (NED) for COVID-19), March 18th (week following NED), and March 25th (2 weeks after NED). In addition, a variable identifying the total change across platforms was also created. All data were collected at the State level. MAIN OUTCOME: Overall, the social media following of the state Public Health Departments was very low. There was a significant increase in the public interest in following the Public Health Departments during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: With the declaration of National Emergency, there was a 150% increase in overall public following of the State Public Health Departments in the U.S. The increase was most noted in the Midwest and South regions of the U.S. The overall following in the pandemic ""hotspots,"" such as New York, California, and Florida, was significantly lower. Interesting correlations were noted between various demographic variables, health, and education ranking of the States and the social media following of their Health Departments. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Social media following of Public Health Departments across all States of the U.S. was very low. Though, the social media following significantly increased during the early course of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it still remains low. Significant opportunity exists for Public Health Departments to improve social media use to engage the public better.","Khokhar, Areej; Spaulding, Aaron; Niazi, Zuhair; Ailawadhi, Sikander; Manochakian, Rami; Chanan-Khan, Asher; Niazi, Shehzad; Sher, Taimur",J Prim Care Community Health,640,24

Conjunctival swab was collected from both eyes of 36 patients (72 eyes), detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in conjunctival swab of two patients (5.5%). Among the 18 patients with conjunctivitis, only one of them (5.5%) showed positive results. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in one patient without conjunctivitis (5.5%).

Drawing from Issue Niche Theory, we examined how NGOs' networks and discourse evolved before and after the general public paid great attention to the COVID-19 issue and how such patterns changed across the whole issue niche and sub-issue niches. We analyzed the evolution of Twitter-based networks and discourse of 2,588 NGOs in the first five months of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. Our analysis revealed important factors that shape tie formation patterns in the NGOs' communities in this novel issue niche. The findings show that NGOs’ discourses help to orient the organizational community to identify most salient issues.

It is known that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sometimes present in the blood of COVID-19 patients. VV-ECMO is often used for several weeks, and plasma leaks can occur, albeit rarely. Hence, in terms of infection control, a concern is that SARS-CoV-2 may leak from the gas outlet port of the oxygenator during ECMO support of critically ill COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 leaks from the oxygenator during ECMO support. Five patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia were placed on VV-ECMO. Silicone-coated polypropylene membrane oxygenators were used in the ECMO circuits for these patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in serum and at the gas outlet port of the ECMO circuit at the time of circuit replacement or liberation from ECMO. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the gas outlet port of the ECMO circuit for 3 of the 5 patients. None of the medical staff involved in the care of these 5 patients has been infected with COVID-19. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 could leak to the gas outlet port of the ECMO circuit through silicone-coated polypropylene membranes during ECMO support of critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Ogawa, Tatsunori; Uemura, Tatsuki; Matsuda, Wataru; Sato, Motohiko; Ishizuka, Kota; Fukaya, Takashi; Kinoshita, Noriko; Nakamoto, Takato; Ohmagari, Norio; Katano, Harutaka; Suzuki, Tadaki; Hosaka, Shigeru",ASAIO. j,640,16

With the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2, there are now seven human coronaviruses. Those that cause mild diseases are the 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, and the pathogenic species are SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) are spherical (125nm diameter), and enveloped with club-shaped spikes on the surface giving the appearance of a solar corona. Within the helically symmetrical nucleocapsid is the large positive sense, single stranded RNA. Of the four coronavirus genera (&#945;,ß,Î³,Î´), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are classified under &#945;-CoV (HCoV-229E and NL63) and ß-CoV (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoVOC43 and HCoV-HKU1). SARS-CoV-2 is a ß-CoV and shows fairly close relatedness with two bat-derived CoV-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Even so, its genome is similar to that of the typical CoVs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats, and it appears to be so for SARS-CoV-2 as well. The possibility of an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans has already been shown with civet cats acting as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoVs, and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV. Human-to-human transmission is primarily achieved through close contact of respiratory droplets, direct contact with the infected individuals, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. The coronaviral genome contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, all of which are encoded within the 3' end of the genome. The S protein mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors resulting in fusion and subsequent viral entry. The M protein is the most abundant protein and defines the shape of the viral envelope. The E protein is the smallest of the major structural proteins and participates in viral assembly and budding. The N protein is the only one that binds to the RNA genome and is also involved in viral assembly and budding. Replication of coronaviruses begin with attachment and entry. Attachment of the virus to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the S protein and its specific receptor. Following receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol via cleavage of S protein by a protease enzyme, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The next step is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic RNA and then translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes. Following replication and subgenomic RNA synthesis, encapsidation occurs resulting in the formation of the mature virus. Following assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis.","Malik, Y A",Malays J Pathol,640,29

Not only will stressors increase risk for symptom exacerbation and/or relapse, but individuals will also have limited service access during this critical time. Individuals with SUD are using free, online digital recovery support services (D-RSS) that leverage peer-to-peer connection (i.e., social-online D-RSS) which simultaneously help these individuals to access support and adhere to public health guidelines. Barriers to SUD treatment and recovery support service access, however, are not unique to the COVID-19 epoch. The pandemic creates an opportunity to highlight problems that will persist beyond its immediate effects, and to offer potential solutions that might help address these long-standing, systemic issues. To help providers and other key stakeholders effectively support those interested in, or who might benefit from, participation in free, social-online D-RSS, this review outlines the following: 1) theories of expected therapeutic benefits from, and potential drawbacks of social-online D-RSS participation; 2) a typology that can be used to describe and classify D-RSS; 3) a D-RSS ""case study"" to illustrate how to apply the theory and typology; 4) what is known empirically about social-online D-RSS; and 5) whether and how to engage individuals with these online resources. METHOD: Narrative review combining research and theory on both in-person recovery supports and social-online D-RSS. RESULTS: Studies examining in-person recovery support services, such as AA and other mutual-help organizations, combined with theory about how social-online D-RSS might confer benefit, suggest these digital supports may engage individuals with SUD and mobilize salutary change in similar ways. While people may use in-person and digital supports simultaneously, when comparing the two modalities, communication science and telemedicine group therapy data suggest that D-RSS may not provide the same magnitude of benefit as in-person services. D-RSS can be classified based on the a) type of service, b) type of platform, c) points of access, and d) organizations responsible for their delivery. Research has not yet rigorously tested the effectiveness of social-online D-RSS specifically, though existing data suggest that those who use these services generally find their participation to be helpful. Content analyses suggest that these services are likely to facilitate social support and unlikely to expose individuals to harmful situations. CONCLUSIONS: When in-person treatment and recovery support services are limited, as is the case during the COVID-19 pandemic, expected therapeutic benefits and emerging data, taken together, suggest providers, mentors, and other community leaders may wish to refer individuals with current and remitted SUD to free, social-online D-RSS. Given the array of available services in the absence of best practice guidelines, we recommend that when making D-RSS referrals, stakeholders familiarize themselves with theorized benefits and drawbacks of participation, use a typology to describe and classify services, and integrate current empirical knowledge, while relying on trusted federal, academic, and national practice organization resource lists.","Bergman, Brandon G; Kelly, John F",J Subst Abuse Treat,640,26

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. However, it is still controversial whether vertical transmission exists. In order to investigate the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission, we explored ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) expression patterns in peri-implantation embryos and the maternal-fetal interface using previously published single-cell transcriptome data. The results show that day 6 (D6) trophectoderm cells (TE) in peri-implantation embryos, as well as syncytiotrophoblast (STB) at 8 weeks of gestation (STB_8W) and extravillous trophoblasts cells (EVT) at 24 weeks of gestation (EVT_24W) in the maternal-fetal interface, strongly co-expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2, indicating SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility. The ACE2 positive-expressing cells in the three cell types mentioned above are found to share common characteristics, which are involved in autophagy and immune-related processes. ACE2 showed no gender bias in post-implantation embryos but showed a significant gender difference in D6_TE, D6 primitive endoderm cells (PE), and ACE2 positive-expressing STBs. These findings indicate that there may be different SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibilities of D6 embryos of different genders and during the gestation of different genders. Our results reveal potential SARS-CoV-2 infection risks during embryo transfer, peri-implantation embryo development, and gestation.","Chen, Wei; Yuan, Peng; Yang, Ming; Yan, Zhiqiang; Kong, Siming; Yan, Jie; Liu, Xixi; Chen, Yidong; Qiao, Jie; Yan, Liying",,640,16

Platelets play a vital part in evading immune surveillance and angiogenesis in the case of tumor metastasis. The study aimed to analyze the predictive and prognostic effects of platelet count on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the prognostic effects of platelets on 52 NSCLC patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant following EGFR-TKI treatment. Related data, together with the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were collected before and after 2 cycles of treatments (60 days). RESULTS: The anti-EGFR treatment markedly reduced the platelet count in 33 (63.5%) patients after 2 cycles of treatment. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that, the decreased platelet count was closely correlated with the longer OS (HR = 0.293; 95%CI: 0.107-0.799; p = 0.017). Besides, the median OS was 326 days in the decreased platelet count group and 241 days in the increased platelet count group (HR = 0.311; 95%CI: 0.118-0.818; P = 0.018), as obtained from the independent baseline platelet levels and other clinical features. CONCLUSIONS: The platelet count may predict the prognosis for EGFR-TKI treatment without additional costs. Besides, changes in platelet count may serve as a meaningful parameter to establish the prognostic model for NSCLC patients receiving anti-EGFR targeted therapy.","Xu, Lu; Xu, Fangzhou; Kong, Haobo; Zhao, Meiling; Ye, Yuanzi; Zhang, Yanbei",BMC Cancer,640,1

It has been suspected that infected persons who remain asymptomatic play a significant role in the ongoing pandemic, but their relative number and effect have been uncertain. The authors sought to review and synthesize the available evidence on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asymptomatic persons seem to account for approximately 40% to 45% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and they can transmit the virus to others for an extended period, perhaps longer than 14 days. Asymptomatic infection may be associated with subclinical lung abnormalities, as detected by computed tomography. Because of the high risk for silent spread by asymptomatic persons, it is imperative that testing programs include those without symptoms. To supplement conventional diagnostic testing, which is constrained by capacity, cost, and its one-off nature, innovative tactics for public health surveillance, such as crowdsourcing digital wearable data and monitoring sewage sludge, might be helpful.","Oran, Daniel P; Topol, Eric J",Ann Intern Med,640,20

Being a new disease there is lack of information about pathogenesis and proliferation pathways of this new coronavirus. Currently there is no effective treatment for coronavirus infection; major effort is to develop vaccine against the virus and development of therapeutic drugs for the disease. The development of genome-based vaccine and therapeutic antibodies require thorough testing for safety and will be available after some time. In the meanwhile, the available practical approach is to repurpose existing therapeutic agents, with proven safety record as a rapid response measure for the current pandemic.

However, differences in individual environments affect people’s psychological intervention demands and intervention mode choices. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical value to analyze and identify the key factors affecting these demands and choices. Based on a nationwide sample of 24,188 respondents from the “Internet Survey of Residents’ Behavioral Changes and Psychological Conditions during the Epidemic”, the different characteristics of public psychological intervention demands and choices under different factors are explored in this paper. The results demonstrate that: (1) the psychological status of Chinese people was relatively stable during the epidemic period, and there were 1016 respondents who had subjective demands for a psychological intervention, (2) age, gender, occupation type, residence, family size, risk perception, psychological status, education level, and fixed expenditure all significantly affect public psychological intervention demands, and (3) risk perception, psychological status, age, gender, and family size will impact the choice of psychological intervention methods. The above results can provide a decision-making basis for the construction of a psychological intervention system in psychological crisis management during the post-epidemic prevention and control period, as well as reference and suggestions for handling psychological stress of similar sudden crisis events in the future.","Su, Fang; Fan, Bingjie; Song, Nini; Dong, Xue; Wang, Yanxia; Li, Jingzhong; Xue, Bing; Qiao, Xianrong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,640,1

However, like hardness, yield strength, fatigue life, and other material properties, wear data exhibit varying degrees of repeatability and reproducibility (R/R). Repeatability concerns the replication of experiments within the same laboratory using the same equipment and materials. Reproducibility concerns testing on different equipment, usually at a different location, but using the same lot of specimens and procedures. An important question is: How many replicate measurements are needed to validate trends in wear behavior or to relatively rank materials, surface treatments, or lubricants? Without repeatability information, it is virtually impossible to establish whether reported material rankings or the effects of variables are real or fall within normal data scatter. The purpose of this paper is to characterize and analyze the R/R of wear data that result from a variety of sources, including material homogeneity, choice of units of measure, and choice of experimental variables. Case studies compare R/R for different forms of wear and their test methods, including ASTM standards. Lessons learned are presented for five forms of wear: (1) cavitation erosion, (2) three-body abrasion, (3) solid particle erosion, (4) dry sliding wear, and (5) fuel lubricity using the ball-on-cylinder (BOCLE) test. Wear transitions can also affect R/R. These examples provide insights for validating wear models, deciding how many repeated tests to make, and when ranking wear-resistance.","Blau, P.J.",Wear,640,1

The institutional guidelines indicate that all surgical procedures require a negative COVID test within four days of surgery. Operating room (OR) delays/cancellations related to pending COVID results can lead to unnecessary waste of PPE resources. Additionally, it can cause undue emotional distress for the patient and family, which affects the patient experience. Objectives of Project The objective of this project was to reduce OR delays/cancellations related to COVID-19 testing. Process of implementation Perioperative guidelines and workflow on testing for COVID-19 prior to surgery was developed utilizing the institutional guidelines, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations. A tracking tool was created to enter COVID-19 test information, starting from 6/15/2020. This data included information regarding test status, delays and cancellations. Testing appointments and pending results were reviewed throughout the day to ensure timely identification and interventions if the patients fell outside the COVID testing criteria. Communication to surgical and leadership teams were also completed to ensure proper follow up and escalation of processes. Statement of Successful Practice The development of a COVID-19 test tracking tool data indicates significant reduction of OR delay or cancellation. The overall data from June to August 2020 shows that COVID-19 pending tests have improved significantly from 6.8% to 0.2%. Of the pending results, the delay of surgical cases improved from 2.9% to 0.2%; and the cancellations of cases improved from 0.7% to 0.07%. Implications for perianesthesia nurses and future research Having a tracking tool provides perianesthesia nurses an opportunity to quickly identify COVID testing needs.

Our objective was to comprehensively evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a clinically diverse COVID-19 convalescent cohort at defined time points to determine if anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist and to identify clinical and demographic factors that correlate with high titers. Using a novel multiplex assay to quantify IgG against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a receptor binding domain-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 inhibition assay, and a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay, we found that 98% of COVID-19 convalescent subjects had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies five weeks after symptom resolution (n=113). Further, antibody levels did not decline three months after symptom resolution (n=79). As expected, greater disease severity, older age, male sex, obesity, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score correlated with increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels.

The most essential work of the task force includes the generation of a study portal with metadata, selected instruments, other study documents, and study results as well as a search engine for preprint publications. Additional contents include a concept for the linkage between research and routine data, a service for an enhanced practice of image data, and the application of a standardized analysis routine for harmonized quality assessment.

Our group previously showed the importance of DDC in viral infections. We hereby aimed to investigate DDC expression in COVID-19 patients and cultured SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, also in association with ACE2 and dACE2. We concurrently evaluated the expression of the viral infection- and interferon-stimulated gene ISG56 and the immune-modulatory, hypoxia-regulated gene EPO. Viral load and mRNA levels of DDC, ACE2, dACE2, ISG56 and EPO were quantified by RT-qPCR in nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 patients, showing no or mild symptoms, and from non-infected individuals. Samples from influenza-infected patients were analyzed in comparison. SARS-CoV-2-mediated effects in host gene expression were validated in cultured virus-permissive epithelial cells. We found substantially higher gene expression of DDC in COVID-19 patients (7.6-fold; p = 1.2e-13) but not in influenza-infected ones, compared to non-infected subjects. dACE2 was more elevated (2.9-fold; p = 1.02e-16) than ACE2 (1.7-fold; p = 0.0005) in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. ISG56 (2.5-fold; p = 3.01e-6) and EPO (2.6-fold; p = 2.1e-13) were also increased. Detected differences were not attributed to enrichment of specific cell populations in nasopharyngeal tissue. While SARS-CoV-2 virus load was positively associated with ACE2 expression (r≥0.8, p<0.001), it negatively correlated with DDC, dACE2 (r≤−0.7, p<0.001) and EPO (r≤−0.5, p<0.05). Moreover, a statistically significant correlation between DDC and dACE2 expression was observed in nasopharyngeal swab and whole blood samples of both COVID-19 and non-infected individuals (r≥0.7). In VeroE6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 negatively affected DDC, ACE2, dACE2 and EPO mRNA levels, and induced cell death, while ISG56 was enhanced at early hours post-infection. Thus, the regulation of DDC, dACE2 and EPO expression in the SARS-CoV-2-infected nasopharyngeal tissue is possibly related with an orchestrated antiviral response of the infected host as the virus suppresses these genes to favor its propagation.","Mpekoulis, George; Frakolaki, Efseveia; Taka, Styliani; Ioannidis, Anastasios; Vassiliou, Alice G.; Kalliampakou, Katerina I.; Patas, Kostas; Karakasiliotis, Ioannis; Aidinis, Vassilis; Chatzipanagiotou, Stylianos; Angelakis, Emmanouil; Vassilacopoulou, Dido; Vassilaki, Niki",PLoS One,640,28

We propose a method for predicting both ICU requirements and the number of deaths, and which will enable the health authorities of the countries involved to plan the resources needed to face the pandemic as many days in advance as possible. Methods We use official Spanish data to predict ICU admissions and deaths based on the number of infections. We employ OLS to perform the econometric estimation, and through RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and SMAPE forecast performance measures we select the best lagged predictor of both dependent variables. Findings For Spain, our prediction shows that the best predictor of ICU admissions is the number of people infected eight days before, and that the best predictor of deaths is the number of people infected five days before. In the first case, we obtain a 98% coefficient of determination, and in the second a 97% coefficient. The estimated delayed elasticities find that a 1% increase in the number of cases today will imply a 0.72% increase in ICU patients eight days later and a 1.09% increase in the number of deaths five days later. Interpretation The model is not intended to analyse the epidemiology of COVID-19. Our objective is rather to estimate a leading indicator of clinical needs. Having a forecast model available several days in advance can enable governments to more effectively face the gap between needs and resources triggered by the outbreak and thus reduce the deaths caused by COVID-19.","Hierro-Recio, Luis Angel; Garzon-Gordon, Antonio Jose; Atienza-Montero, Pedro; Marquez, Jose Luis",,640,1

METHODS We use the cross-sectional online survey data of 2080 individuals, collected from 442 households during June to September 2020 in Bangladesh. The Longini and Koopman stochastic epidemic modelling approach was adapted for analyzing the data. To validate the results, a simulation study was conducted using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in the context of Bayesian framework. RESULTS Overall, the prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic was 15.1% (315 out of 2080) among people in Bangladesh. This proportion was higher in smaller households (size one: 40.0%, two: 35.7% and three: 25.9%) than larger (four: 15.8%, five: 13.3%, six: 14.1%, seven: 12.5% eight: 8.7%, nine: 14.8% and ten or eleven: 5.7%). The transmission rate of COVID-19 in community people was higher (12.0%, 95% CI: 10.0% to 13.0%) than household members (9.0%, 95% CI: 6.0% to 11.0%). CONCLUSION The susceptible individuals have a higher risk of community infection than the household and the community transmission is more responsible than the household for COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.","Rahman, Atikur; Marjan, Nahyatul; Afroz, Nahida; Afroz, Nilima; Hossain, Zakir",International journal of clinical practice,640,1

Previous studies suggest that the absence of a home crowd changes the home field advantage in terms of match outcomes, offensive performance, and referee decisions. However, because of the small sample sizes, these changes may be random rather than meaningful. To test this, we created 1,000,000 randomized samples from the previous four seasons with the exact same number of matches played behind closed doors in Europe’s four most elite soccer leagues at the end of the 2019/2020 season. We found that across countries (Germany, Spain, Italy, and England), performance indices and referee decisions (except red cards) indeed changed to the detriment of the home team beyond the level of chance. However, this overall pattern could be ascribed to specific countries. Most importantly, the proportion of points won by the home teams declined significantly only in Germany, which was accompanied by a meaningful increase in (1) the proportion of goals scored by the away teams and (2) the proportion of yellow cards given to the home teams. We conclude that the home field advantage may indeed be lost when spectators are absent. However, in future studies, more detailed behavioral analyses are needed to determine the robustness and the behavioral determinants of this phenomenon across leagues and countries.","Hill, Yannick; Van Yperen, Nico W.",Front Psychol,640,16

It relates infection and removal rates and is validated by the global Covid 19 data. Over 186,000 data points, from 190 countries and the states of the US, for the period April 1 to December 12, 2020 - fall on a single line, as the Universal rule predicts, transcending geography, ethnicity and race. The Universal rule requires that Herd immunity begin when just 25% of the population is vaccinated. With the anticipated 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days of the Biden administration, Herd immunity may be imminent in the US. The Universal rule promotes a temporary stasis with continuing infections and hospitalizations and becomes a barrier to runaway infections, making it practically impossible to reach Herd immunity, as Sweden discovered. Reduced infected population seems to be a third option to stifle the epidemic - a little known accomplishment, first by North Dakota and subsequently by twelve other U.S. states, including South Dakota.","Kuriyan, J.",,640,16

Although several standardized protocols have been proposed to target microbes on fomites through surface decontamination, use of microbicidal agents, and cleaning processes, only limited guidance is available on microbial decontamination of indoor air to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission between individuals. This article reviews the salient aspects of airborne transmission of infectious agents, exposure assessment, in vitro assessment of microbicidal agents, and processes for air decontamination for infection prevention and control. Laboratory-scale testing (eg, rotating chambers, wind tunnels) and promising field-scale methodologies to decontaminate indoor air are also presented. The potential of bacteriophages as potential surrogates for the study of airborne human pathogenic viruses is also discussed.","Duchaine, Caroline",Am J Infect Control,640,21

We aimed to compare the performance of the NEWS and NEWS2 in patients with COVID-19 versus those without during the first phase of the pandemic. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: Two acute hospitals (Scarborough and York) are combined into a single dataset and analysed collectively. PARTICIPANTS: Adult (≥18 years) non-elective admissions discharged between 11 March 2020 and 13 June 2020 with an index or on-admission NEWS2 electronically recorded within ±24 hours of admission to predict mortality at four time points (in-hospital, 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours) in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 admissions. RESULTS: Out of 6480 non-elective admissions, 620 (9.6%) had a diagnosis of COVID-19. They were older (73.3 vs 67.7 years), more often male (54.7% vs 50.1%), had higher index NEWS (4 vs 2.5) and NEWS2 (4.6 vs 2.8) scores and higher in-hospital mortality (32.1% vs 5.8%). The c-statistics for predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 admissions was significantly lower using NEWS (0.64 vs 0.74) or NEWS2 (0.64 vs 0.74), however, these differences reduced at 72hours (NEWS: 0.75 vs 0.81; NEWS2: 0.71 vs 0.81), 48 hours (NEWS: 0.78 vs 0.81; NEWS2: 0.76 vs 0.82) and 24hours (NEWS: 0.84 vs 0.84; NEWS2: 0.86 vs 0.84). Increasing NEWS2 values reflected increased mortality, but for any given value the absolute risk was on average 24% higher (eg, NEWS2=5: 36% vs 9%). CONCLUSIONS: The index or on-admission NEWS and NEWS2 offers lower discrimination for COVID-19 admissions versus non-COVID-19 admissions. The index NEWS2 was not proven to be better than the index NEWS. For each value of the index NEWS/NEWS2, COVID-19 admissions had a substantially higher risk of mortality than non-COVID-19 admissions which reflects the increased baseline mortality risk of COVID-19.","Richardson, Donald; Faisal, Muhammad; Fiori, Massimo; Beatson, Kevin; Mohammed, Mohammed",BMJ Open,640,27

However, the impact of lockdowns and shutdowns on the power system in different regions as well as periods of the pandemic can hardly be reflected on the foundation of current studies. In this paper, a prediction-based analysis method is developed to point out the electricity consumption gap resulted from the pandemic situation. The core of this method is a novel optimized grey prediction model, namely Rolling IMSGM(1,1) (Rolling Mechanism combined with grey model with initial condition as Maclaurin series), which achieves better prediction results in the face of long-term emergencies. A novel initial condition is adopted to track data with various characteristics in the form of higher-order polynomials, which are then determined by intelligent algorithms to realize accurate fitting. Historical power consumption data in China are utilized to carry out the monthly forecasts during COVID-19. Compared with other competitive models’ prediction results, the superiority of IMSGM(1,1) are demonstrated. Through analyzing the gap between predicted consumption values and the actual data, it can be found that the impact of the pandemic on electricity varies in different periods, which is related to its severity and the local lockdown policies. This study helps to understand the impact on power industry in the face of such an emergency intuitively so as to respond to possible future events.","Huang, Liqiao; Liao, Qi; Qiu, Rui; Liang, Yongtu; Long, Yin",Appl Energy,640,20

In this research, we collected data from January 1 to March 30, 2020 (90 days). This study used secondary data of meteorological and air pollutant parameters obtained from the Pollution Control Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment as well as daily confirmed COVID-19 case data in the BMR obtained from the official webpage of the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. We employed descriptive statistics, and Spearman and Kendall rank correlation tests were used to investigate the associations of weather variables, air pollutants, AQI with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. Our findings indicate that CO, NO(2), SO(2), O(3) PM(10), PM(2.5), AQI have a significantly negative association with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the BMR, whereas meteorological parameters such as temperature, relative humidity (RH), absolute humidity (AH) and wind speed (WS) showed significant positive associations with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the BMR. Our study is a useful supplement to encourage regulatory bodies to promote environmental strategies, as air pollution regulation could be a sustainable policy for mitigating the harmful effects of air pollutants. Furthermore, this study provides new insights into the relationship between daily meteorological factors, AQI, and air pollutants and daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the BMR. These data may provide useful information to the public health authorities and decision makers in Thailand, as well as to the World Health Organization (WHO), in order to set proper strategic aimed at reducing the impact of the COVID-19. Future studies concerning SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses should investigate the possibility of infectious droplet dispersion in indoor and outdoor air during and after the epidemic outbreak.","Sangkham, Sarawut; Thongtip, Sakesun; Vongruang, Patipat",Environ Res,640,0
