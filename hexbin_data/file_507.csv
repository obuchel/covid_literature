6368,Sommergrippe: Mehr als ein Mythos!,2019-06-22,"Viral and microbial constituents contain specific motifs or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are recognized by cell surface- and endosome-associated Toll-like receptors (TLRs). In addition, intracellular viral double-stranded RNA is detected by two recently characterized DExD/H box RNA helicases, RIG-I and Mda-5. Both TLR-dependent and -independent pathways engage the IκB kinase (IKK) complex and related kinases TBK-1 and IKKɛ. Activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) transcription factor pathways are essential immediate early steps of immune activation; as a result, both pathways represent prime candidates for viral interference. Many viruses have developed strategies to manipulate NF-κB signaling through the use of multifunctional viral proteins that target the host innate immune response pathways. This review discusses three rapidly evolving areas of research on viral pathogenesis: the recognition and signaling in response to virus infection through TLR-dependent and -independent mechanisms, the involvement of NF-κB in the host innate immune response and the multitude of strategies used by different viruses to short circuit the NF-κB pathway.","Hiscott, J; Nguyen, T-L A; Arguello, M; Nakhaei, P; Paz, S",Oncogene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100320/,507

We investigated whether automated voice signal analysis can be used to distinguish patients with laryngeal cancer from healthy subjects. We extracted features using the software package for speech analysis in phonetics (PRAAT) and calculated the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from voice samples of a vowel sound of /a:/. The proposed method was tested with six algorithms: support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosted machine (LGBM), artificial neural network (ANN), one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN). Their performances were evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The result was compared with human performance. A total of four volunteers, two of whom were trained laryngologists, rated the same files. The 1D-CNN showed the highest accuracy of 85% and sensitivity and sensitivity and specificity levels of 78% and 93%. The two laryngologists achieved accuracy of 69.9% but sensitivity levels of 44%. Automated analysis of voice signals could differentiate subjects with laryngeal cancer from those of healthy subjects with higher diagnostic properties than those performed by the four volunteers.","Kim, HyunBum; Jeon, Juhyeong; Han, Yeon Jae; Joo, YoungHoon; Lee, Jonghwan; Lee, Seungchul; Im, Sun",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7692693/,507

One of the most essential and leading goals of the BioMEMS and biosensor technologies is to develop point-of-care (POC) testing systems to perform rapid prognostic or diagnostic tests at a patient site with high accuracy. Manipulation of particles in the analyte of interest is a vital task for POC and biosensor platforms. Dielectrophoresis (DEP), the induced movement of particles in a non-uniform electrical field due to polarization effects, is an accurate, fast, low-cost, and marker-free manipulation technique. It has been indicated as a promising method to characterize, isolate, transport, and trap various particles. The aim of this review is to provide fundamental theory and principles of DEP technique, to explain its importance for the BioMEMS and biosensor fields with detailed references to readers, and to identify and exemplify the application areas in biosensors and POC devices.

14791,Kongresse des BDI,2021-01-20,"Allowing students to voluntarily ask and answer questions in front of the whole class are common teaching practices used in college science courses. However, few studies have examined college science students’ perceptions of these practices, the extent to which students choose to engage in these practices, and what discourages students from participating. In this study, we surveyed 417 undergraduates at a research-intensive institution about their experiences asking and answering questions in large-enrollment college science courses. Specifically, students answered questions about to what extent they perceive voluntarily asking and answering questions in large-enrollment science courses is helpful to them and why. They also answered questions about to what extent they engage in asking and answering questions in large-enrollment college science courses and what factors could discourage them from participating. Using binary logistic regression, we examined whether there were differences among students of different demographic groups regarding their opinions about asking and answering questions. We found that overwhelmingly students reported that other students voluntarily asking and answering instructor questions is helpful to them. Notably, compared to continuing generation students, first-generation students were more likely to perceive other students asking questions to be helpful. Despite perceiving asking and answering questions to be helpful, over half of students reported that they never ask or answer questions in large-enrollment college science courses during a semester, and women were more likely than men to report never asking questions. We identified fear of negative evaluation, or students’ sense of dread associated with being unfavorably evaluated, as a primary factor influencing their decision to answer instructor questions. This work adds to a growing body of literature on student participation in large-enrollment college science courses and begins to uncover underlying factors influencing student participation.","Nadile, Erika M.; Alfonso, Emilie; Barreiros, Briana Michelle; Bevan-Thomas, William D.; Brownell, Sara E.; Chin, Megan R.; Ferreira, Isabella; Ford, Sariah A.; Gin, Logan E.; Gomez-Rosado, Jomaries O.; Gooding, George; Heiden, Alyssa; Hutt, Airyn E.; King, Meagan L.; Perez, Shannon G.; Rivera Camacho, Yasiel I.; Salcedo, Flor; Sellas, Christopher F.; Sinda, Krystian A.; Stahlhut, Katherine N.; Stephens, Michelle D.; Wiesenthal, Nicholas J.; Williams, Keonti D.; Zheng, Yi; Cooper, Katelyn M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7802933/,507

15594,Mitteilungen des BDI,2021-02-25,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are relevant in developing countries where frequencies can be at least 3 times higher than in developed countries. The purpose of this research was to describe the intervention implemented in intensive care units (ICUs) to reduce HAIs through collaborative project and analyze the variation over 18 months in the incidence density (ID) of the three main HAIs: ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and catheter-related urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) and also the length of stay and mortality in these ICUs. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study in five public adult clinical-surgical ICUs, to reduce HAIs, through interventions using the BTS-IHI “Improvement Model”, during 18 months. In the project, promoted by the Ministry of Health, Brazilian philanthropic hospitals certified for excellence (HE), those mostly private, certified as excellence and exempt from security contributions, regularly trained and monitored public hospitals in diagnostics, data collection and in developing cycles to improve quality and to prevent HAIs (bundles). In the analysis regarding the length of stay, mortality, the IDs of VAP, CLABSIs and CAUTIs over time, a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model was applied for continuous variables, using the constant correlation (exchangeable) between assessments over time. The model estimated the average difference (β coefficient of the model) of the measures analyzed during two periods: a period in the year 2017 (prior to implementing the project) and in the years 2018 and 2019 (during the project). RESULT: A mean monthly reduction of 0.427 in VAP ID (p = 0.002) with 33.8% decrease at the end of the period and 0.351 in CAUTI ID (p = 0.009) with 45% final decrease. The mean monthly reduction of 0.252 for CLABSIs was not significant (p = 0.068). Length of stay and mortality rates had no significant variation. CONCLUSIONS: Given the success in reducing VAP and CAUTIs in a few months of interventions, the achievement of the collaborative project is evident. This partnership among public hospitals/HE may be applied to other ICUs including countries with fewer resources.

15595,Kongresse des BDI,2021-02-25,"[Image: see text] Strain engineering as a method to control functional properties has seen in the last decades a surge of interest. Heterostructures comprising 2D-materials and containing van der Waals(-like) gaps were considered unsuitable for strain engineering. However, recent work on heterostructures based on Bi(2)Te(3), Sb(2)Te(3), and GeTe showed the potential of a different type of strain engineering due to long-range mutual straining. Still, a comprehensive understanding of the strain relaxation mechanism in these telluride heterostructures is lacking due to limitations of the earlier analyses performed. Here, we present a detailed study of strain in two-dimensional (2D/2D) and mixed dimensional (2D/3D) systems derived from mica/Bi(2)Te(3), Sb(2)Te(3)/Bi(2)Te(3), and Bi(2)Te(3)/GeTe heterostructures, respectively. We first clearly show the fast relaxation process in the mica/Bi(2)Te(3) system where the strain was generally transferred and confined up to the second or third van der Waals block and then abruptly relaxed. Then we show, using three independent techniques, that the long-range exponentially decaying strain in GeTe and Sb(2)Te(3) grown on the relaxed Bi(2)Te(3) and Bi(2)Te(3) on relaxed Sb(2)Te(3) as directly observed at the growth surface is still present within these three different top layers a long time after growth. The observed behavior points at immediate strain relaxation by plastic deformation without any later relaxation and rules out an elastic (energy minimization) model as was proposed recently. Our work advances the understanding of strain tuning in textured heterostructures or superlattices governed by anisotropic bonding.","Zhang, Heng; Yimam, Daniel T.; de Graaf, Sytze; Momand, Jamo; Vermeulen, Paul A.; Wei, Yingfen; Noheda, Beatriz; Kooi, Bart J.",ACS Nano,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7905873/,507
16344,Kongresse des BDI,2021-03-25,"Comparing the pathogen genomes from several cases of an infectious disease has the potential to help us understand and control outbreaks. Many methods exist to reconstruct a phylogeny from such genomes, which represents how the genomes are related to one another. However, such a phylogeny is not directly informative about transmission events between individuals. TransPhylo is a software tool implemented as an R package designed to bridge the gap between pathogen phylogenies and transmission trees. TransPhylo is based on a combined model of transmission between hosts and pathogen evolution within each host. It can simulate both phylogenies and transmission trees jointly under this combined model. TransPhylo can also reconstruct a transmission tree based on a dated phylogeny, by exploring the space of transmission trees compatible with the phylogeny. A transmission tree can be represented as a coloring of a phylogeny where each color represents a different host of the pathogen, and TransPhylo provides convenient ways to plot these colorings and explore the results.

16481,Mitteilungen des Berufsverbandes der Deutschen Radiologen,2021-03-31,"A homeostatic balance exists between the resident microbiota in the oral cavity and the host. Perturbations of the oral microbiota under particular conditions can contribute to the growth of non-oral pathogens that are hard to kill because of their higher resistance to antimicrobials, raising the probability of treatment failure and reinfection. The presence of these bacteria in the oral cavity has been proven to be associated with several oral diseases such as periodontitis, caries, and gingivitis, and systemic diseases of importance in clinical medicine such as cystic fibrosis, HIV, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, it is still controversial whether these species are merely transient members or unique to the oral cavity. Mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between the oral microbiota and non-oral pathogens can also occur, though the mechanisms used by these bacteria are not clear. Therefore, this review presents an overview of the current knowledge about the presence of non-oral bacteria in the oral cavity, their relationship with systemic and oral diseases, and their interactions with oral bacteria.

Single doses of 6 mg dexamethasone phosphate (DEX-P), betamethasone phosphate (BET-P), or 1:1 mixture of betamethasone phosphate and acetate (BET-PA) were administered orally (PO) or intramuscularly (IM) where each woman enrolled in a two-period cross-over study. Plasma concentrations collected over 96 h were described with a two-compartment model with differing PO and IM first-order absorption inputs. Overall, BET exhibited slower clearance, similar volume of distribution, faster absorption, and longer persistence than DEX with BET acetate producing extremely slow absorption but full bioavailability of BET. Six biomarkers were assessed over a 24-h baseline period with four showing circadian rhythms with complex baselines. These baselines and the strong responses seen after drug dosing were fitted with various indirect response models using the Laplace estimation methods in NONMEM 7.4. Both the PK and six biomarker responses were well-described with modest variability likely due to the homogeneous ages, weights, and ethnicities of the women. The drugs either inhibited or stimulated the influx processes with some models requiring joint inclusion of drug effects on circadian cortisol suppression. The biomarkers and order of sensitivity (lowest IC(50)/SC(50) to highest) were: cortisol, T-helper cells, basophils, glucose, neutrophils, and T-cytotoxic cells. DEX sensitivities were generally greater than BET with corresponding mean ratios for these biomarkers of 2.86, 1.27, 1.72, 1.27, 2.69, and 1.06. Overall, the longer PK (e.g. half-life) of BET, but lesser PD activity (e.g. higher IC(50)), produces single-dose response profiles that appear quite similar, except for the extended effects from BET-PA. This comprehensive population modeling effort provides the first detailed comparison of the PK profiles and six biomarker responses of five commonly used dosage forms of DEX and BET in healthy women.

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) plays an essential role in this process; it is a transcription factor that mediates erythropoietin (EPO) induction at the transcriptional level under hypoxic environment. After successful cDNA cloning in 1995, a line of studies were conducted for elucidating the molecular mechanism of HIF activation in response to hypoxia. In 2001, cDNA cloning of dioxygenases acting on prolines and asparagine residues, which play essential roles in this process, was reported. HIF-prolyl hydroxylases (PHs) are molecules that constitute the core molecular mechanism of detecting a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen, or hypoxia, in the cells; they can be called oxygen sensors. In this review, I discuss the process of molecular cloning of HIF and HIF-PH, which explains hypoxia-induced EPO expression; the development of HIF-PH inhibitors that artificially or exogenously activate HIF by inhibiting HIF-PH; and the significance and implications of medical intervention using HIF-PH inhibitors.","Hirota, Kiichi",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8146675/,507

However, the lack of reliable promoters has limited its ability to express foreign antigens. In the present study, 21 promoters were identified from Listeria monocytogenes through RNA-seq analysis under two pH conditions of pH 7.4 and pH 5.5. Based on the constructed fluorescence report system, 7 constitutive promoters exhibited higher strength than P(help) (1.8-fold to 5.4-fold), a previously reported strong promoter. Furthermore, the selected 5 constitutive promoters exhibited higher UreB production activity than P(help) (1.1-fold to 8.3-fold). Notably, a well-characterized constitutive promoter P(18) was found with the highest activity of fluorescence intensity and UreB production. In summary, the study provides a panel of strong constitutive promoters for Listeria monocytogenes and offers a theoretical basis for mining constitutive promoters in other organisms. KEY POINTS: • Twenty-one promoters were identified from L. monocytogenes through RNA-seq. • Fluorescent tracer of L. monocytogenes (P(18)) was performed in vitro and in vivo. • A well-characterized constitutive promoter P(18) could improve the expression level of a foreign antigen UreB in L. monocytogenes SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00253-021-11374-z.","Ma, Junfei; Ji, Qianyu; Wang, Shuying; Qiu, Jingxuan; Liu, Qing",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175932/,507
18074,Die erste Seite,2021-06-10,"BACKGROUND: Artificial Intelligence has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, and it is increasingly being deployed to support and assist medical diagnosis. One potential application of AI is as the first point of contact for patients, replacing initial diagnoses prior to sending a patient to a specialist, allowing health care professionals to focus on more challenging and critical aspects of treatment. But for AI systems to succeed in this role, it will not be enough for them to merely provide accurate diagnoses and predictions. In addition, it will need to provide explanations (both to physicians and patients) about why the diagnoses are made. Without this, accurate and correct diagnoses and treatments might otherwise be ignored or rejected. METHOD: It is important to evaluate the effectiveness of these explanations and understand the relative effectiveness of different kinds of explanations. In this paper, we examine this problem across two simulation experiments. For the first experiment, we tested a re-diagnosis scenario to understand the effect of local and global explanations. In a second simulation experiment, we implemented different forms of explanation in a similar diagnosis scenario. RESULTS: Results show that explanation helps improve satisfaction measures during the critical re-diagnosis period but had little effect before re-diagnosis (when initial treatment was taking place) or after (when an alternate diagnosis resolved the case successfully). Furthermore, initial “global” explanations about the process had no impact on immediate satisfaction but improved later judgments of understanding about the AI. Results of the second experiment show that visual and example-based explanations integrated with rationales had a significantly better impact on patient satisfaction and trust than no explanations, or with text-based rationales alone. As in Experiment 1, these explanations had their effect primarily on immediate measures of satisfaction during the re-diagnosis crisis, with little advantage prior to re-diagnosis or once the diagnosis was successfully resolved. CONCLUSION: These two studies help us to draw several conclusions about how patient-facing explanatory diagnostic systems may succeed or fail. Based on these studies and the review of the literature, we will provide some design recommendations for the explanations offered for AI systems in the healthcare domain.

This bottleneck is particularly pronounced when interrogating long-range co-evolved genetic interactions given the read-length limitations of next-generation sequencing platforms. This has hampered the direct observation of these genetic interactions that code for protein-protein interfaces with relevance in both drug and vaccine development. Here we overcome these technical limitations by developing a nanopore-based long-range viral sequencing pipeline that yields accurate single molecule sequences of circulating virions from clinical samples. We demonstrate its utility in observing the evolution of individual HIV Gag-Pol genomes in response to antiviral pressure. Our pipeline, called Multi-read Hairpin Mediated Error-correction Reaction (MrHAMER), yields >1000s of viral genomes per sample at 99.9% accuracy, maintains the original proportion of sequenced virions present in a complex mixture, and allows the detection of rare viral genomes with their associated mutations present at <1% frequency.

21235,Corona-Splitter,2021-09-23,"OBJECTIVES: Our recent systematic review determined that remote patient monitoring (RPM) interventions can reduce acute care use. However, effectiveness varied within and between populations. Clinicians, researchers, and policymakers require more than evidence of effect; they need guidance on how best to design and implement RPM interventions. Therefore, this study aimed to explore these results further to (1) identify factors of RPM interventions that relate to increased and decreased acute care use and (2) develop recommendations for future RPM interventions. DESIGN: Realist review—a qualitative systematic review method which aims to identify and explain why intervention results vary in different situations. We analysed secondarily 91 studies included in our previous systematic review that reported on RPM interventions and the impact on acute care use. Online databases PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched in October 2020. Included studies were published in English during 2015–2020 and used RPM to monitor an individual’s biometric data (eg, heart rate, blood pressure) from a distance. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Contextual factors and potential mechanisms that led to variation in acute care use (hospitalisations, length of stay or emergency department presentations). RESULTS: Across a range of RPM interventions 31 factors emerged that impact the effectiveness of RPM innovations on acute care use. These were synthesised into six theories of intervention success: (1) targeting populations at high risk; (2) accurately detecting a decline in health; (3) providing responsive and timely care; (4) personalising care; (5) enhancing self-management, and (6) ensuring collaborative and coordinated care. CONCLUSION: While RPM interventions are complex, if they are designed with patients, providers and the implementation setting in mind and incorporate the key variables identified within this review, it is more likely that they will be effective at reducing acute hospital events.

Human-computer interactions involving electronic health records (EHRs) have become pervasive and act as an avenue for quantifying these collaborations using statistical and network analysis methods. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to measure HCW collaboration and its characteristics by analyzing concurrent EHR usage. METHODS: By extracting concurrent EHR usage events from audit log data, we defined concurrent sessions. For each HCW, we established a metric called concurrent intensity, which was the proportion of EHR activities in concurrent sessions over all EHR activities. Statistical models were used to test the differences in the concurrent intensity between HCWs. For each patient visit, starting from admission to discharge, we measured concurrent EHR usage across all HCWs, which we called temporal patterns. Again, we applied statistical models to test the differences in temporal patterns of the admission, discharge, and intermediate days of hospital stay between weekdays and weekends. Network analysis was leveraged to measure collaborative relationships among HCWs. We surveyed experts to determine if they could distinguish collaborative relationships between high and low likelihood categories derived from concurrent EHR usage. Clustering was used to aggregate concurrent activities to describe concurrent sessions. We gathered 4 months of EHR audit log data from a large academic medical center’s neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to validate the effectiveness of our framework. RESULTS: There was a significant difference (P<.001) in the concurrent intensity (proportion of concurrent activities: ranging from mean 0.07, 95% CI 0.06-0.08, to mean 0.36, 95% CI 0.18-0.54; proportion of time spent on concurrent activities: ranging from mean 0.32, 95% CI 0.20-0.44, to mean 0.76, 95% CI 0.51-1.00) between the top 13 HCW specialties who had the largest amount of time spent in EHRs. Temporal patterns between weekday and weekend periods were significantly different on admission (number of concurrent intervals per hour: 11.60 vs 0.54; P<.001) and discharge days (4.72 vs 1.54; P<.001), but not during intermediate days of hospital stay. Neonatal nurses, fellows, frontline providers, neonatologists, consultants, respiratory therapists, and ancillary and support staff had collaborative relationships. NICU professionals could distinguish high likelihood collaborative relationships from low ones at significant rates (3.54, 95% CI 3.31-4.37 vs 2.64, 95% CI 2.46-3.29; P<.001). We identified 50 clusters of concurrent activities. Over 87% of concurrent sessions could be described by a single cluster, with the remaining 13% of sessions comprising multiple clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging concurrent EHR usage workflow through audit logs to analyze HCW collaboration may improve our understanding of collaborative patient care. HCW collaboration using EHRs could potentially influence the quality of patient care, discharge timeliness, and clinician workload, stress, or burnout.","Li, Patrick; Chen, Bob; Rhodes, Evan; Slagle, Jason; Alrifai, Mhd Wael; France, Daniel; Chen, You",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8449299/,507

23812,Schwarze Haarknötchenkrankheit,2009-08-18,"This chapter explores how postmodernism and its rejection of grand narratives inform current epistemological theory, emerging from the study of contagion as a fluid and transgressive phenomenon. Donner proposes a drastic re-centering of epistemology around the notion of belief as well as the abandonment of truth and knowledge as possible objects of enquiry. By embracing the idea that the foundations of every belief cannot but themselves be the unjustified and unjustifiable products of an epistemic act, the result of an arbitrary cultural or individual decision, this chapter suggests a new approach to epistemology. Re-framing belief as akin to an insidious form of viral programming, lurking endemically in every belief and act, this new theory signals the invariably performative dimension of every belief and, ultimately, the necessary ethical responsibility revealed by applying epidemiological thinking to epistemological problems.","Donner, Mathieu",Endemic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119914/,507

Viren müssen sich ständig den Bedingungen ihres Wirtes oder ihrer Wirtspopulationen anpassen, sodass Mechanismen der Selektion experimentellen Ansätzen zugänglich sind. Dabei spielen unterschiedliche Kriterien, wie die antigene Diversität, das Ausmaß der Virusausscheidung, der Grad der Virulenz und viele andere Faktoren eine wichtige Rolle. Die vollständige Adaptation eines Virus an seinen Wirt, welche in eine möglichst geringe Virulenz des Infektionserregers mündet, ist die für beide erstrebenswerte Konsequenz: ein problemloses Zusammen- und Überleben. So scheinen die Hepatitis-G-Viren, die zwar erstmals aus Patienten mit einer Leberentzündung isoliert wurden, ähnlich wie die TT-Viren in vielen Menschen zu persistieren, ohne dass sie dabei Erkrankungen verursachen (▸Abschnitte 14.5 und 20.2).","Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Schätzl, Hermann",Molekulare Virologie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120978/,507
24983,Krim-Fieber,2009-08-18,"“Why do parasites harm their host?” is a recurrent question in evolutionary biology and ecology, and has several implications for the biomedical sciences, particularly public health and epidemiology. Contrasting the meaning(s) of the concept of “virulence” in molecular pathology and evolutionary ecology, we review different explanations proposed as to why, and under what conditions, parasites cause harm to their host: whereas the former uses molecular techniques and concepts to explain changes and the nature of virulence seen as a categorical trait, the latter conceptualizes virulence as a phenotypic quantitative trait (usually related to a reduction in the host’s fitness). After describing the biology of emerging influenza viruses we illustrate how the ecological and the molecular approaches provide distinct (but incomplete) explanations of the 1918–19 influenza pandemic. We suggest that an evolutionary approach is necessary to understand the dynamics of disease transmission but that a broader understanding of virulence will ultimately benefit from articulating and integrating the ecological dynamics with cellular mechanisms of virulence. Both ecological and functional perspectives on host-pathogens’ interactions are required to answer the opening question but also to devise appropriate health-care measures in order to prevent (and predict?) future influenza pandemics and other emerging threats. Finally, the difficult co-existence of distinct explanatory frameworks reflects the fact that scientists can work on a same problem using various methodologies but it also highlights the enduring tension between two scientific styles of practice in biomedicine.","Méthot, Pierre-Olivier; Alizon, Samuel","Classification, Disease and Evidence",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121464/,507

26859,Akute Störungen der Atmung: spezielle Krankheitsbilder,2012-05-30,"There is increasing recognition of infections caused by respiratory viruses (RVs) as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, especially within the thoracic and pediatric population. In addition to their direct, cytopathic, and tissue-invasive effects, RVs can create an inflammatory environment, autoimmune responses, resulting in acute and chronic rejection, although this relationship remains controversial. A laboratory diagnosis in SOT with respiratory syndrome should be performed with nucleic acid amplification tests on respiratory specimens, mainly nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Treatment options remain limited and consist of supportive care, reduction of immunosuppression, and, if available, antiviral therapy. The use of immunomodulatory agents remains a clinical dilemma. Since treatment options for RVs are limited, maximizing prevention measures against viral infections in SOT is mandatory. The main preventive strategy against influenza remains the administration of yearly inactivated influenza vaccine in all SOT. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence-based recommendations on the diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies to decrease the burden of RV infections in SOT recipients.","Peghin, Maddalena; Danziger-Isakov, Lara",Infectious Diseases in Solid-Organ Transplant Recipients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123882/,507

35116,Mitteilungen des BDI,2020-06-22,"JPEG algorithm defines a sequence of steps (essential and optional) executed in order to compress an image. The first step is an optional conversion of the image color space from RBG (red-blue-green) to YCbCr (luminance and two chroma components). This step allows to discard part of chrominance information, a useful gain due to the fact, that the chrominance resolution of the human eye is much lower than the luminance resolution. In the next step, the image is divided into 8[Formula: see text]8 blocks, called MCUs (Minimum Coded Units). In this paper we present a new adaptive bitmap compression algorithm, and we compare it to the state-of-the-art of JPEG algorithms. Our algorithm utilizes hypergraph grammar model, partitioning the bitmap into a set of adaptively selected rectangles. Each rectangle approximates a bitmap using MCUs with the size selected according to the entire rectangular element. The hypergraph grammar model allows to describe the whole compression algorithm by a set of five productions. They are executed during the compression stage, and they partition the actual rectangles into smaller ones, until the required compression rate is obtained. We show that our method allows to compress bitmaps with large uniform areas in a better way than traditional JPEG algorithms do.","Soliński, Grzegorz; Woźniak, Maciej; Ryzner, Jakub; Mosiałek, Albert; Paszyńska, Anna",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304022/,507

39325,Exokrine Pankreasinsuffizienz,2013,"High temperature sensing sensitivity and luminescence intensity of phosphors are crucial factors for excellent optical temperature sensing performance. Based on material design, the pure phase and two-phase solid solutions were prepared by regulating the relative content of cations Ca(2+) and La(3+) in CaWO(4)–La(2)(WO(4))(3), respectively. The up-conversion luminescence (UCL) and optical temperature sensing performance of rare earth ions Er(3+)/Yb(3+) co-doped CaWO(4)–La(2)(WO(4))(3) were studied. As guided by regulating cation composition through partial substituting Ca(2+) ions by La(3+) ions, the UCL intensity of two-phase solid solutions at 552 nm is much higher than that of pure phase material. The UCL intensity of 0.2La(2)(WO(4))(3)–0.8CaWO(4): 1%Er(3+), 5%Yb(3+) is as 33.5 times as that of CaWO(4): 1%Er(3+), 5%Yb(3+) material. More importantly, the high temperature sensing sensitivity (0.01026 K(−1)) is achieved in a wider temperature range 83–683 K in optimal UCL material 0.2La(2)(WO(4))(3)–0.8CaWO(4): 1%Er(3+), 5%Yb(3+). It is suggested that material design theory can be used as a powerful tool to accelerate discovery of novel optical temperature sensing materials, with implications even for the design of other optoelectronic materials.","Zhang, Ying; Wang, Xusheng; Liu, Qian; Song, Zhitang",J Mater Sci: Mater Electron,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7491023/,507

Unfortunately, this useful set of tools can also be abused and turned into an attack vector, providing malware with the ability to interact and read content from third-party apps. In this work, we are the first to study the impact that the stealthy exploitation of Android accessibility services can have on significantly reducing the forensic footprint of malware attacks, thus hindering both live and post-incident forensic investigations. We show that through Living off the Land (LotL) tactics, or by offering a malware-only substitute for attacks typically requiring more elaborate schemes, accessibility-based malware can be rendered virtually undetectable. In the LotL approach, we demonstrate accessibility-enabled SMS and command and control (C2) capabilities. As for the latter, we show a complete cryptocurrency wallet theft, whereby the accessibility trojan can hijack the entire withdrawal process of a widely used app, including two-factor authentication (2FA). In both cases, we demonstrate how the attacks result in significantly diminished forensic evidence when compared to similar attacks not employing accessibility tools, even to the extent of maintaining device take-over without requiring malware persistence.","Leguesse, Yonas; Vella, Mark; Colombo, Christian; Hernandez-Castro, Julio",Security and Trust Management,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7491630/,507

39365,Adipositas,2013,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Placental malaria is the primary mechanism through which malaria in pregnancy causes adverse perinatal outcomes. This review summarizes recent work on the significance, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prevention of placental malaria. RECENT FINDINGS: Placental malaria, characterized by the accumulation of Plasmodium-infected red blood cells in the placental intervillous space, leads to adverse perinatal outcomes such as stillbirth, low birth weight, preterm birth, and small-for-gestational-age neonates. Placental inflammatory responses may be primary drivers of these complications. Associated factors contributing to adverse outcomes include maternal gravidity, timing of perinatal infection, and parasite burden. SUMMARY: Placental malaria is an important cause of adverse birth outcomes in endemic regions. The main strategy to combat this is intermittent preventative treatment in pregnancy; however, increasing drug resistance threatens the efficacy of this approach. There are studies dissecting the inflammatory response to placental malaria, alternative preventative treatments, and in developing a vaccine for placental malaria.","Zakama, Arthurine K.; Ozarslan, Nida; Gaw, Stephanie L.",Curr Trop Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7493061/,507
39846,Mitteilungen des BDI,2020-09-25,"BACKGROUND: Attitudes towards patients with self-harm behaviors are decisive for the quality of the relationship of healthcare professionals towards them, which is further linked to successful treatment. In mental health settings, nurses are the ones spending the longest time caring for these patients. Nurses often experience negative emotions while delivering care which may lead to professional burnout and suboptimal patient care. The purpose of this study was to explore the feelings and attitudes of nurses working in different psychiatric hospital settings toward adolescents and young adults with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects were nurses from the tertiary psychiatric hospital who deliver mental health care to patients with NSSI on a daily basis (n = 76; 20 males, 56 females; average age 42 ± 8 years; average working experience 20 ± 9 years). Data were collected via a self-report questionnaire consisting of three parts (sociodemographic data, Emotional Burden, Adapted Self-Harm Antipathy-Scale). In the latter two parts of the questionnaire, the subjects rated their level of agreement with the emotions and statements on a five-point Likert scale. Nonparametric tests were used for statistical analysis. The statistical significance was set to p < 0.05. RESULTS: The emotions of nurses towards patients with NSSI were not very negative and the attitudes were positive. Powerlessness was the most prevalent (3.55 ± 1.038) of the studied emotions, followed by uncertainty (3.21 ± 1.225). The subjects disagreed with feeling anger (2.34 ± 1.17) and despair (2.07 ± 1.09) and were undecided about being afraid (3.07 ± 1.2). The nurses with higher education felt more negative emotions than those with medium education. Education did not affect nurses’ attitudes. The nurses from non-psychotherapeutic units felt more negative emotions and less positive attitudes than those from psychotherapeutic units. Gender did not affect the emotions felt towards patients, but the female nurses held more positive and less negative attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: The respondents expressed low levels of negative emotions and positive and caring attitudes towards patients with NSSI, indicating a good predisposition for empathetic work and long-term burnout prevention. However, the differences observed with regards to education, gender and especially working environment indicate the different needs for environmental, educational and supervisory support.","Pintar Babič, Matejka; Bregar, Branko; Drobnič Radobuljac, Maja",Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7508242/,507

YouTube™ is a popular video-sharing web platform that can be used as a source of information for SMBG. This study aimed to assess the usefulness of YouTube™ videos on SMBG. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched the keywords “blood glucose self-monitoring,” “home blood glucose monitoring,” “blood glucose test,” and “blood sugar test” on YouTube™. The first 40 videos of each search were listed. After the two-stage screening, 49 videos were included for final data analysis. General characteristics and SMBG-specific characteristics (namely, strip handling, lancing device handling, measurement, and post- measurement action) were observed with pre-defined criteria having “yes” and “no” closed option. Data were tested statistically by the binomial test. RESULTS: Average duration of 49 videos was 244.20 ± 72.61 s and those were online since 35.14 ± 20.52 months on YouTube™. Information about strip handling was mostly deficient, major being checking the expiry date (16.33% videos had the information). The handling of the lancing device was correct in the majority of the videos except for the disinfection of the tip of the lancing device (6.12% videos had the information). The measurement procedure was also correct in the majority of the videos except for the instruction to dry the hands (38.78% videos had the information) after washing. The post-measurement logbook entry was found in 48.98% videos. CONCLUSION: YouTube™ videos can be used as a potential source of information for patients’ education for SMBG. However, there are various levels of the incompleteness of the tutorials. Primary care physicians may suggest YouTube™ videos after exploring the videos and selecting the most appropriate one for their patients.","Mondal, Himel; Mondal, Shaikat",Indian J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7485635/,507

40217,Vorgehen bei Begleiterkrankungen,2016-06-14,"BACKGROUND: Deformed wing virus (DWV) is a virulent virus that causes honeybee disease. DWV can exist as a latent infection in honeybees, outbreak into epidemics, and cause serious damage to beekeeping cross the world, including Vietnam. METHODS: The two DWV strains circulating in Vietnamese honeybee, Apis cerana, were first isolated from adult honeybees in North Vietnam (DWV-NVN) and South Vietnam (DWV-SVN). Their complete nucleotide sequences were determined, aligned, and compared with other DWV strains. RESULTS: The two Vietnamese DWV strains comprised 10,113 bp and contained a large single open reading frame (ORF) of 2,893 amino acids, initiating at nucleotide 1,130 and terminating at nucleotide 9,812. Multiple nucleotide sequence alignment between these two DWV-VN strains and DWV strains in A. mellifera was performed. The DWV-VN strains showed a low genetic identity (from 91.4% to 92.0%) with almost of these strains, but lower identities (89.2% and 89.4%) with UK2 and (89.6%) with the China2 strain. Low identities (91.7% and 91.9%) were also observed between the China3 strain (in A. cerana) and the DWV-VN strains, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence alignment showed high genetic similarities (97.0%–97.9%) when the USA1, Chile, Italy1, France, UK1, UK2, Japan, Korea2, China1, China2 and China3 strains were compared to the DWV-VN strains. This ratio was 96.7% and 96.8% when the Korea1 strain was compared to the DWV-SVN and DWV-NVN strains, respectively. Numerous amino acid substitutions were identified in the L, VP3, and RdRp sequences. Notably, we observed six substitutions positioned at amino acids 27 (E > I), 98 (S > T), 120 (A > V), 153 (M > T), 170 (D > F), and 174 (Y > F) in the L protein, two amino acid changes at positions 980 (S > A) and 1032 (E > T) in VP3, and one amino acid change at position 2627 (R > C) unique to the DWV-VN strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete genome sequences, RdRp sequences and Simplot analysis indicated that there was a significant difference between DWV-VN strains in A. cerana and DWV strains in A. mellifera. The results suggested that the genetic variations of the DWV-VN strains in A. cerana help them to adapt geographical conditions and may lead to change the viral pathogenicity of DWV-VN strains.","Thu, Ha T.; Lien, Nguyen T.K.; Lanh, Pham T.; Duong, Bui T.T.; Hoa, Nguyen T.; Phuoc, Man H.; Thai, Pham H.; Quyen, Dong Van",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7513742/,507

Today, the importance of competitions for both educational purposes and technological innovation is widely recognised by the community. In this paper, we present an overview of this kind of challenges, using the most representative events to describe common trends and unique aspects. RECENT FINDINGS: Recently, competitions have been in a rapid evolution. Trends are the increasing popularity of Grand Challenges, the push for autonomous decision-making, the introduction of multi-domain cooperation and the birth of virtual competitions. More attention has been given to the scientific aspects, stressing the benchmarking/metrological perspective. Finally, forums and workshops are currently seen as a way to complement competitions and to create a community of interest. SUMMARY: Marine robotics competitions enable junior and expert teams to acquire experience in realistic environments. Virtual competitions can help in this aspect. They are useful for preparing team participation in the physical events, especially for open sea competitions. They allow teams to focus on advancing vehicle autonomy. Furthermore, they are important to widen the marine community attracting other robotics and AI experts.","Ferreira, Fausto; Ferri, Gabriele",Curr Robot Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7527245/,507

However, coinciding with this global, deadly pandemic is the proliferation of fake news. While pandemics and fake news are not new phenomena, an unprecedented time in history is presently unfolding when considered with the postdigital era. Digital media enables the prolific repetitious spread of fake news during crises when accurate and truthful information is necessary. Consequently, the ability of humans to discern between fact and fiction diminishes. It has resulted in some people making life-ending decisions based on their exposure to fake news. In this article, I define a primarily ignored and invisible epistemological process at work: negative epistemic postdigital inculcation, that, while has been at work with the rise of modern digital media, has primarily become visible because of the interrelationships between implicit learning, Covid-19, fake news, and digital media.

40264,Nervensystem,2016-06-14,"Host-associated bacteria and fungi, comprising the microbiota, are critical to host health. In the airways, the composition and diversity of the mucosal microbiota of patients are associated with airway health status. However, the relationship between airway microbiota and respiratory inflammation is not well-understood. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a complex disease that affects up to 14% of the US population. Previous studies have shown decreased microbial diversity in CRS patients and enrichment of either Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although bacterial community composition is variable across CRS patients, Malassezia is a dominant fungal genus in the upper airways of the majority of healthy and CRS subjects. We hypothesize that distinct bacterial-fungal interactions differentially influence host mucosal immune response. Thus, we investigated in vitro and in vivo interactions between Malassezia sympodialis, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus. The in vitro interactions were evaluated using the modified Kirby-Bauer Assay, Crystal Violet assay for biofilm, and FISH. A pilot murine model of acute sinusitis was used to investigate relationships with the host immune response. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were intranasally instilled in the presence or absence of M. sympodialis (n = 66 total mice; 3–5/group). Changes in the microbiota were determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and host immune response was measured using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In vitro, only late stage planktonic P. aeruginosa and its biofilms inhibited M. sympodialis. Co-infection of mice with M. sympodialis and P. aeruginosa or S. aureus differently influenced the immune response. In co-infected mice, we demonstrate different expression of fungal sensing (Dectin-1), allergic responses (IL-5, and IL-13) and inflammation (IL-10, and IL-17) in murine sinus depending on the bacterial species that co-infected with M. sympodialis (p < 0.05). The pilot results suggest that species-specific interactions in airway-associated microbiota may be implicated driving immune responses. The understanding of the role of bacterial-fungal interactions in CRS will contribute to development of novel therapies toward manipulation of the airway microbiota.","Lee, Keehoon; Zhang, Irene; Kyman, Shari; Kask, Oliver; Cope, Emily Kathryn",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498577/,507

52074,Kongresse des BDI,2021-04-27,"INTRODUCTION: Social media facilitates the rapid spread of information and misinformation to the public. Medical students as healthcare professionals in training have a responsibility to support public health advocacy. As such, it is important to understand whether medical students feel comfortable to use social media as a tool to promote public health. There is little literature evaluating this. The covid-19 pandemic gives us a unique opportunity to characterise this relationship. METHODS: This is a cross sectional survey-based study run by the student surgical society at Hull York Medical School. Data will be collected on confidence of medical students in receiving, appraising and resharing information on social media. The study will first be run as a single centre study. Following data collection and analysis, will be promoted to other student surgical societies across the UK to be run as a collaborative national study. RESULTS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: How confident are medical students in receiving, appraising and resharing information they receive on social media?: Secondary Objective: Is there a relationship between years of training or postgraduate/undergraduate status and confidence in using social media amongst medical students? How often do medical students use social media as their primary source of information? Is there adequate education on how social media can be used to combat misinformation?: Conclusion: The covid-19 pandemic allows a unique opportunity to characterise the relationship between medical students, social media, and health advocacy. Understanding this relationship will help guide medical education to incorporate social media as an effective tool in healthcare.","Veerappan, Vigneshwar Raj; Begum, Ruksana; Raja, Abdullah; Quddus, Tanjim; Senan, Rahul; Senan, Rahul",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030149/,507
52076,Mitteilungen des BDI,2021-04-27,"INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has greatly impacted medical education, resulting in changes to teaching, examinations and research opportunities. We explored changes across these areas, evaluating their impact on medical education. METHODS: Pubmed was searched using the terms “medical education”, “COVID-19”, and “changes”, yielding 174 results. Relevant results were assessed to determine perceived impact on medical education, categorised as changes to teaching, examinations, and research opportunities. RESULTS: Changes to teaching included the introduction of virtual learning, with in-person lectures replaced by recordings or livestreams to facilitate remote teaching. Perceived advantages included increased flexibility, although drawbacks include increased reporting of loneliness. With social-distancing measures limiting the number of individuals allowed in theatre, opportunities for surgical experience have been greatly reduced. Online assessments have largely replaced traditional written examinations, with the introduction of new mediums in order to assess “soft-skills”, as demonstrated by virtual OSCE examinations. However, the efficacy of such mediums has yet to be demonstrated. Despite large volumes of COVID-19-related studies, research as a whole has been negatively affected by restrictions in both funding and research-related hiring, as well as pauses on many clinical trials. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has resulted in significant changes to medical education, including greatly accelerating the incorporation of technology in medical teaching. These novel adaptations may be permanently incorporated into curriculums due to possible benefits in flexibility. However, these changes are not without drawbacks, including reduced opportunities for research and surgical experience.","Kabbani, Jade; Kabbani, Jamil; Kabbani, Jade",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030152/,507

Analysis of macroscopic, histopathological findings with clinical features was performed. All 3 deceased patients were Caucasian males (average age 61 years, range from 56 to 68 years). Using real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, the patients were confirmed (antemortem) to have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Two patients were obese, and 1 patient had type 2 diabetes mellitus. The medical history of 1 patient included hemorrhagic pancreatitis, gangrenous cholecystitis, Acinetobacter baumanii sepsis, and cholecystectomy. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 2 patients. At autopsy, in 1 case, the lungs showed bilateral interstitial pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), while in another case, interstitial pulmonary lymphoid infiltrates and enlarged atypical pneumocytes were present but without DAD. Microthrombi in lung vessels and capillaries were observed in 2 cases. This study revealed thrombotic complications of COVID-19 and interstitial pneumonia with DAD presence as the main autopsy findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that was confirmed antemortem with molecular tests.

397395,Fujifilm tests favipiravir as COVID-19 treatment,2020,"BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis is one of the most severe complications after prosthetic valve implantation and an accurate diagnosis is a clinical challenge. The purpose was to assess the diagnostic usefulness of cardiac computed tomography (CT) in valvular and perivalvular complications in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and to compare CT results with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and intraoperative findings. METHODS: The retrospective study included 44 consecutive patients with PVE who underwent cardiac surgery. The mean age was 59.6â¯±â¯12.9 years, 33 (75 %) were males. The presence of vegetations, abscess/pseudoaneurysm, paravalvular leakage (PVL) and inflammatory infiltration were evaluated by TTE, TEE and CT prior to surgery and the results were compared with intraoperative findings. RESULTS: Endocarditis affected 47 valves (26 mechanical, 21 biological) in 44 patients. PVE most often affected the aortic valve (nâ¯=â¯36), followed by the mitral valve (nâ¯=â¯9) and the pulmonary valve (nâ¯=â¯2). In the per-valve analysis, the sensitivity of TTE, TEE and CT in diagnosing vegetations was 65 %, 91 % and 96 %; abscess 44 %, 77 % and 89 %; paravalvular leakage 90 %, 100 % and 70 %; inflammatory infiltration 39 %, 56 % and 78 %, respectively. The combination of CT and echocardiography allowed the detection of abscesses/pseudoaneurysms and inflammatory infiltration in all cases except one. CONCLUSION: CT was superior to echocardiography in the diagnosis of paravalvular abscesses, vegetations and inflammatory infiltration. Echocardiography had a higher diagnostic value to CT in the evaluation of paravalvular leakage. Cardiac CT combined with echocardiography improves the diagnostic accuracy of PVE and both modalities should be performed.","Michalowska, Ilona; Stoklosa, Patrycjusz; Milkowska, Malgorzata; Zakrzewski, Dariusz; Nieznanska, Malgorzata; Kwiatek, Pawel; Lewandowska, Sylwia; Kusmierski, Krzysztof; Kolsut, Piotr; Kusmierczyk, Mariusz; Kuriata, Jaroslaw; Zatorska, Karina; Hryniewiecki, Tomasz",Eur J Radiol,,507

This crisis affects people in their most important, committed, and intimate relationships. Although this crisis has damaged the health and well-being of individuals, crushed economies, and led to an extensive period of uncertainty about the future, there may also be positive outcomes in the motivation people have to protect their relationships. In this paper, we focus on strategies that therapists and relationship educators can use to help couples preserve and protect their relationships during such a time. We describe four foundations of safety that allow relationships to thrive: physical, emotional, commitment, and community. We then highlight three keys from our body of work that can help guide individuals and couples in protecting their relationships on a day-to-day and moment-to-moment basis: (1) decide, don't slide; (2) make it safe to connect; (3) do your part.","Stanley, Scott M; Markman, Howard J",Fam Process,,507

418291,Liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen,2020,"In the African context, there is a paucity of data on SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 in pregnancy. Given the endemicity of infections such as malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), it is important to evaluate coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and their impact on maternal/infant outcomes. Robust research is critically needed to evaluate the effects of the added burden of COVID-19 in pregnancy, to help develop evidence-based policies toward improving maternal and infant outcomes. In this perspective, we briefly review current knowledge on the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy; the risks of preterm birth and cesarean delivery secondary to comorbid severity; the effects of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on the fetus/neonate; and in utero mother-to-child SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We further highlight the need to conduct multicountry surveillance as well as retrospective and prospective cohort studies across SSA. This will enable assessments of SARS-CoV-2 burden among pregnant African women and improve the understanding of the spectrum of COVID-19 manifestations in this population, which may be living with or without HIV, TB, and/or other coinfections/comorbidities. In addition, multicountry studies will allow a better understanding of risk factors and outcomes to be compared across countries and subregions. Such an approach will encourage and strengthen much-needed intra-African, south-to-south multidisciplinary and interprofessional research collaborations. The African Forum for Research and Education in Health's COVID-19 Research Working Group has embarked upon such a collaboration across Western, Central, Eastern and Southern Africa.","Nachega, Jean B; Sam-Agudu, Nadia A; Budhram, Samantha; Taha, Taha E; Vannevel, Valerie; Somapillay, Priya; Ishoso, Daniel Katuashi; Tshiasuma Pipo, Michel; Bongo-Pasi Nswe, Christian; Ditekemena, John; Ayele, Birhanu T; Machekano, Rhoderick N; Gachuno, Onesmus W; Kinuthia, John; Mwongeli, Nancy; Sekikubo, Musa; Musoke, Philippa; Agbeno, Evans Kofi; Umar, Lawal W; Ntakwinja, Mukanire; Mukwege, Denis M; Smith, Emily R; Mills, Eduard J; Otshudiema, John Otokoye; Mbala-Kingebeni, Placide; Kayembe, Jean-Marie N; Mavungu Landu, Don Jethro; Muyembe Tamfum, Jean-Jacques; Zumla, Alimuddin; Langenegger, Eduard J; Mofenson, Lynne M",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,507

446279,C&EN talks with Holden Thorp,2020,"Recent new materialist and posthumanist research in curriculum and pedagogy studies is focusing more and more on the intertwinement between social justice, fairness, and accountability, and how to put these ideals to use to create inclusive, consciousness-raising canons, curricula, and pedagogies that take the dehumanized and the more-than-human into account. Especially pedagogical responsibility, often rephrased as ‘response-ability’ to accentuate the entanglements that this notion engenders versus forgotten or forcefully eradicated knowledges, and between teacher and student as intra-active learners, is highlighted in this ethico-political turn. In this chapter, a critical pedagogical cartography of response-ability is sketched out to philosophically expand on-and also better anchor-the above turn. This critical cartography is put together at the backdrop of critical new materialist reflections with regards to the COVID-19 crisis;a crisis demanding a pedagogical but also ethico-political reorientation toward the hauntological powers of past-present-future injustices, the thick material present, and a more response-able engagement with the world. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Vivienne Bozalek, Michalinos Zembylas, Siddique Motala and Dorothee Hölscher.","Geerts, E.",Higher Education Hauntologies: Living with Ghosts for a Justice-to-come,,507

Using a study of US adults in late March 2020, we measure how often people witness correction, correct others, or are corrected themselves, using the case of COVID-19 misinformation on social media. Descriptively, our results suggest that all three experiences related to correction on social media are relatively common and occur across partisan divides. Importantly, a majority of those who report seeing misinformation also report seeing it corrected, and a majority of those who report sharing misinformation report being corrected by others. Those with more education are more likely to engage in correction, and younger respondents are more likely to report all three experiences with correction. While experiences with correction are generally unrelated to misperceptions about COVID-19, those who correct others have higher COVID-19 misperceptions. © The Author(s) 2021.","Bode, L.; Vraga, E.

METHOD: Searches were made between January 1, 2016 and August 30, 2020. First, the word ""vitamin"" was searched. Additionally, the search words ""vitamin,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""immunity,"" and Vitamin D,"" ""Vitamin C,"" ""Vitamin E,"" and ""Vitamin A"" were searched comparatively. Search was made in Turkish (in Turkey) and English (in world). Additionally, the word ""vitamin"" was translated into some countries' languages and was searched. Relative search volumes (RSVs) obtained in searches are presented with graphics. RSVs, downloaded as .csv were transferred to SPSS. Descriptive data was given as numbers and percentages. Kruskal-Wallis analysis was used to determine the difference of RSVs according to years and seasons. Additionally, rising queries related to search words were presented. RESULTS: Findings from the present study determined that the trend toward vitamins reached 100 RSVs in March 2020, when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Vitamins D and C were the most frequently searched vitamin type in Turkey and worldwide. It was determined that the searches consisting of a combination of COVID-19 and vitamins were made. CONCLUSION: Vitamins attract the public interest globally. Seasonal variation and COVID-19 shaped the popularity of vitamins both worldwide and in Turkey. The search was highest in the autumn and spring, but the largest search related to all search terms was determined to be in March 2020.

510041,Wie sich das Coronavirus in unsere Praxis schlich,2020,"PROBLEM: Value-added medical education (VAME) has been difficult to implement due to student and educator constraints. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a mass transition to online learning, removed students from clinical settings, and underscored students' desires for meaningful VAME opportunities. The authors introduced the Stanford Frontline COVID-19 Consult Service (SFCS), through which off-service medical and physician assistant (PA) students provided assistance to clinicians in the form of rapid research regarding COVID-19 clinical questions. APPROACH: The SFCS, a student-derived VAME initiative, was implemented from March to May 2020 by Stanford University medical students, PA students, and faculty. SFCS aligned with not only the interests of clinicians and students, but also national accreditation standards. Students attended weekly editorial meetings, didactic sessions on literature reviews and information management, and they underwent rigorous training on the peer-review process. After two months, the authors expanded the service to local community clinicians. OUTCOMES: The SFCS enrolled 16 students, was supported by 13 faculty members, and produced 87 peer-reviewed evidence syntheses. Of the 16 SFCS students, 13 (81%) completed evaluations; of 128 Stanford Primary Care and Population Health clinicians, 48 (38%) completed evaluations. Overall student satisfaction with the SFCS was 4.9/5 (standard deviation [SD] 0.3). Self-assessed achievement of SFCS learning objectives exceeded 90% for all objectives. Overall faculty satisfaction with the SFCS was 4.4/5 (SD 0.8). Most faculty (40/46 [87%]) planned to use the database to answer future COVID-19 questions. NEXT STEPS: The SFCS is a novel, student-initiated VAME curriculum focused on increasing students' meaningful contributions to patient care. The authors will track SFCS students throughout their clerkships to gauge clerkship performance/preparedness, and they will develop training for integrating VAME into preclerkship curricula at other institutions.

630125,Coronavirus — Aktuelle Empfehlungen für den Hausarzt: Neue DEGAM-Leitlinie,2020-04-07,"The COVID-19 pandemic, characterised by a fast and global spread during the first months of 2020, has prompted the development of a structured set of recommendations for cancer care management, to maintain the highest possible standards. Within this framework, it is crucial to ensure no disruption to essential oncological services and guarantee the optimal care. This is a structured proposal for the management of lung cancer, comprising three levels of priorities, namely: tier 1 (high priority), tier 2 (medium priority) and tier 3 (low priority)—defined according to the criteria of the Cancer Care Ontario, Huntsman Cancer Institute and Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale. The manuscript emphasises the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer care and reconsiders all steps from diagnosis, staging and treatment. These recommendations should, therefore, serve as guidance for prioritising the different aspects of cancer care to mitigate the possible negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of our patients. As the situation is rapidly evolving, practical actions are required to guarantee the best patients’ treatment while protecting and respecting their rights, safety and well-being. In this environment, cancer practitioners have great responsibilities: provide timely, appropriate, compassionate and justified cancer care, while protecting themselves and their patients from being infected with COVID-19. In case of shortages, resources must be distributed fairly. Consequently, the following recommendations can be applied with significant nuances, depending on the time and location for their use, considering variable constraints imposed to the health systems. An exceptional flexibility is required from cancer caregivers.","Passaro, Antonio; Addeo, Alfredo; Von Garnier, Christophe; Blackhall, Fiona; Planchard, David; Felip, Enriqueta; Dziadziuszko, Rafal; de Marinis, Filippo; Reck, Martin; Bouchaab, Hasna; Peters, Solange",ESMO Open,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2059702920326740; https://doi.org/10.1136/esmoopen-2020-000820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32581069/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2059702920326740,507

In this devastating situation, precautionary measures, early diagnosis, and repurposed drugs appear to be timely and decisive factors by which to handle this problem until the discovery of an effective, dedicated vaccine or medicine is made. Currently, some researchers and clinicians have claimed evidence exists in favor of the use of some antimalarial drugs (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) antiviral drugs (remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, umifenovir) vitamins, traditional Chinese medicines, and herbal medicines against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the available literature, this review article sought to highlight the current understanding of the origin, transmission, diagnosis, precautionary measures, infection and drug action mechanisms, therapeutic role, and toxicities of targeted drugs for the prevention and cure of COVID‐19. This review may be useful for developing further strategies as a blueprint and understanding the mentioned drugs’ mechanisms to elucidate the possible target of action by which to successfully freeze the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Hussain, Iqbal; Hussain, Afzal; Alajmi, Mohamed F.; Rehman, Md.

655853,Vergessen Sie die Schnellteste auf Coronavirus!,2020-04-07,"In this period of the Covid-19 pandemic, a protective mask has become a common object of use to contain virus transmission. The imminent need for masks has led many governments to produce them, including surgical masks with elastic loops or masks with side cuts at the ears. Among those on the market, surgical masks with elastic loops are the ones most chosen by parents for their children. These elastics cause constant compression on the skin and, consequently, on the cartilage of the auricle, leading to erythematous and painful lesions of the retroauricular skin when the masks are used for many hours a day. Pre-adolescent children have undeveloped auricular cartilage with less resistance to deformation; prolonged pressure from the elastic loops of the mask at the hollow or, even worse, at the anthelix level can influence the correct growth and angulation of the outer ear. In fact, unlike when using conservative methods for the treatment of protruding ears, this prolonged pressure can increase the cephaloauricular angle of the outer auricle. It is important for the authorities supplying the masks to be aware of this potential risk and for alternative solutions to be found while maintaining the possibility of legitimate prevention of the potential spread of the virus.

Several innovative approaches are in development to restrain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In particular, BCG, a vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), is being considered as an alternative therapeutic modality. BCG vaccine is known to induce both humoral and adaptive immunities, thereby activating both nonspecific and cross-reactive immune responses in the host, which combined could effectively resist other pathogens including SARS-CoV-2. Notably, some studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, case positivity, and mortality rate have been higher in countries that have not adopted BCG vaccination than in countries that have done so. This review presents an overview of the concepts underlying BCG vaccination and its nonspecific immuological effects and protection, resulting in ‘trained immunity’ and potential utility for resisting COVID-19.","Malik, Yashpal Singh; Ansari, Mohd Ikram; Ganesh, Balasubramanian; Sircar, Shubhankar; Bhat, Sudipta; Pande, Tripti; Vinodhkumar, OR; Kumar, Prashant; Iqbal Yatoo, Mohd; Tiwari, Ruchi; Touil, Nadia; Patel, Shailesh Kumar; Pathak, Mamta; Sharun, Khan; Dhama, Kuldeep",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991235/; https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1818522,507

We develop a multi sector disequilibrium model with buyer-seller relations between agents located in different countries. The production network model allows us to study not only the direct cost of the lockdown but also indirect costs which emerge from the reductions in the availability of intermediate inputs. Agents determine the quantity of output and the proportions in which to combine inputs using prices that emerge from local interactions. The model is calibrated to the world economy using input-output data on 56 industries in 44 countries including all major economies. Within our model, the lockdowns are implemented as partial reductions in the output of some sectors using data on sectoral decomposition of capacity reductions. We use computational experiments to replicate the temporal sequence of the lockdowns implemented in different countries. World output falls by 7% at the early stage of the crisis when only China is under lockdown and by 23% at the peak of the crisis when many countries are under a lockdown. These direct impacts are amplified as the shock propagates through the world economy because of the buyer-seller relations. Supply-chain spillovers are capable of amplifying the direct impact by more than two folds. Naturally, the substitutability between intermediate inputs is a major determinant of the amplification. We also study the process of economic recovery following the end of the lockdowns. Price flexibility and minor technological adaptations help in reducing the time it takes for the economy to recover. The world economy takes about one quarter to move towards the new equilibrium in the optimistic and unlikely scenario of the end of all lockdowns. Recovery time is likely to be significantly greater if partial lockdowns persist.","Mandel, Antoine; Veetil, Vipin",Econ Disaster Clim Chang,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41885-020-00066-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838118/,507

The aim of this work is to show the changes in the ambulatory care practices by individualized telematic care for each patient profile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles published from March 2020 to January 2021 were reviewed. We selected those that provided the highest levels of evidence regarding risk in different aspects: screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of prostate cancer. RESULTS: We developed a classification system based on priorities, at different stages of the disease (screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up) to which the type of care given, in-person or telephone visits, was adapted. We established 4 options, as follows: in priority A or low, care will be given by telephone in all cases; in priority B or intermediate, if patients are considered subsidiary of an in-person visit after telephone consultation, they will be scheduled within 3 months; in priority C or high, patients will be seen in person within a margin from 1 to 3 months and in priority D or very high, patients must always be seen in person within a margin of up to 48 h and considered very preferential. CONCLUSIONS: Telematic care in prostate cancer offers an opportunity to develop new performance and follow-up protocols, which should be thoroughly analyzed in future studies, in order to create a safe environment and guarantee oncologic outcomes for patients.","García Rodríguez, J.; González Ruiz de León, C.; Sacristán González, R.; Méndez Ramírez, S.; Modrego Ulecia, L.; Fernández-Gómez, J.M.",Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acuroe.2021.07.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2173578621000949?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2173578621000949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34531161/,507

Brachytherapy, being an integral part of radiation therapy, posts a dilemma related to the practice of evidence-based oncology. It requires a significant amount of resources and personnel, thereby increasing the risk of exposure to the virus. There has been a significant amount of papers published providing the best available alternatives to external radiation; however, there is a lack of literature on the practice of brachytherapy. In times of the pandemic, deploying brachytherapy as a treatment modality can act as a double-edged sword and therefore, judicious use is warranted in such times of crisis.
