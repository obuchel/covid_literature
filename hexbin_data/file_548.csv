The data is related to those obtained with other flaviviruses, which are assumed to have a conserved structural organization, and compare the characteristics of flavivirus fusion to those of other enveloped viruses. Fusion proteins from several different virus families, including Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Retroviridae, and Filoviridae have been shown to exhibit striking structural similarities; they all use a common mechanism for inducing membrane fusion, and the same general model applies to all of these cases. The flavivirus genome is a positive-stranded RNA molecule consisting of a single, long open reading frame of more than 10,000 nucleotides flanked by noncoding regions at the 5′ and 3′ ends. The fusion properties of flaviviruses have been investigated using several different assay systems, including virus-induced cell–cell fusion and virus–liposome fusion. All of these studies indicate that flaviviruses require an acidic pH for fusion, consistent with their proposed mode of entry.","Heinz, Franz X; Allison, Steven L",Adv Virus Res,548,4

Several advantages, such as cost-effectiveness, ease of design and production, good biocompatibility of plasmid DNA, attractive biosafety, and DNA stability, are found in DNA vaccines. METHODS: In this study, the plasmids expressing bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) gB, gC, and gD proteins were mixed at the same mass ratio and adsorbed polyethyleneimine (PEI) magnetic beads with a diameter of 50 nm. Further, the plasmid and PEI magnetic bead polymers were packaged into double carboxyl polyethylene glycol (PEG) 600 to use as a DNA vaccine. The prepared DNA vaccine was employed to vaccinate mice via the intranasal route. The immune responses were evaluated in mice after vaccination. RESULTS: The expression of viral proteins could be largely detected in the lung and rarely in the spleen of mice subjected to a vaccination. The examination of biochemical indicators, anal temperature, and histology indicated that the DNA vaccine was safe in vivo. However, short-time toxicity was observed. The total antibody detected with ELISA in vaccinated mice showed a higher level than PBS, DNA, PEI + DNA, and PBS groups. The antibody level was significantly elevated at the 15th week and started to decrease since the 17th week. The neutralizing antibody titer was significantly higher in DNA vaccine than naked DNA vaccinated animals. The total IgA level was much greater in the DNA vaccine group compared to other component vaccinated groups. The examination of cellular cytokines and the percentage of CD4/CD8 indicated that the prepared DNA vaccine induced a strong cellular immunity. CONCLUSION: The mixed application of plasmids expressing BoHV-1 gB/gC/gD proteins by nano-carrier through intranasal route could effectively activate long-term humoral, cellular, and mucosal immune responses at high levels in mice. These data indicate PEI magnetic beads combining with PEG600 are an efficient vector for plasmid DNA to deliver intranasally as a DNA vaccine candidate.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the causes and risk factors of mortality in people admitted with complete acute traumatic spinal cord injury (ATSCI). SETTING: The study was performed at the Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, New Delhi. METHODS: Data between 2000 and 2016 were retrospectively collected from case records of people with ATSCI. Risk factors for mortality were examined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Mortality rate in ATSCI admissions (n = 758) during the study period was 10%. Median (IQR) age of study participants was 34 (21) years with a range of 14–85 years. Respiratory complications, septicemia, and cardiovascular causes were responsible for 42%, 28, and 18% of deaths. Mortality rate in people with paraplegia and tetraplegia was 3% and 22%, respectively. The proportion surviving at 6 weeks was significantly different across people with paraplegia and people with high and low tetraplegia (p < 0.001). Greater age (OR (multivariable models) = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01–1.06), associated injuries (OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.11–5.27), high tetraplegia (OR = 5.09, 95% CI = 2.21–11.72), low tetraplegia (OR = 4.84, 95% CI = 1.29–18.09), need for ventilator support (OR = 31.32, 95% CI = 14.92–65.35), septicemia (OR = 4.60, 95% CI = 1.05–20.07), respiratory complications (OR = 3.46, 95% CI = 1.63–7.33), and cardiovascular causes (OR = 39.03, 95% CI = 8.29–183.89) were significant risk factors associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Respiratory complications, septicemia, and cardiovascular causes were the commonest causes of in-hospital mortality in people with complete ATSCI. Greater age, presence of associated injuries, tetraplegia, and ventilator support were risk factors significantly associated with mortality. To reduce morbidity and mortality in the acute phase, there is a need to focus on respiratory management and prevention of infections, especially in tetraplegics.","Chhabra, Harvinder Singh; Sharawat, Rajesh; Vishwakarma, Gayatri",Spinal Cord,548,4

In this single-center, prospective, one-arm study, we evaluated, in 32 post-HSCT patients, the acceptability of a coaching program inspired by elite sport coaching. Benefits were evaluated by questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The coaching program was accepted by 97% of the patients. Analysis of the scores on the “Means” sub-dimension of Hope showed a significant increase over time (p = 0.0249 < 0.05) for every patient. Qualitative analysis of patient’s satisfaction pointed out that this support facilitated the transition to a life without illness in particular in the non-hospital context of coaching sessions.

Despite the increased demand for economic evidence to support resource allocation for scaled-up implementation of mental health services in these contexts, economic evaluations of psychological treatments for CMDs remain scarce. OBJECTIVE: The proposed systematic review aims to synthesize findings on methods and outcomes of economic evaluations of psychological treatments for CMDs in LMICs and appraise quality. METHODS: We will identify, select, and extract data from published economic evaluations of psychological interventions for CMDs conducted in LMICs. We will search bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, EconLit, PsycINFO, Africa-Wide Information, Cochrane library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD), Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Registry), and the African Journals Online (AJOL) and Google Scholar platforms. Only full economic evaluations (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA), Cost-Consequence Analysis (CCA), or Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)) of psychological treatments for CMDs (defined as depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders) conducted in LMICs will be included. There will be no restrictions based on date of publication, perspective, follow-up duration or sample size. Data extraction will be guided by the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. RESULTS: The results presented will be examined using a narrative synthesis approach. The quality of included studies will be assessed using the Drummond & Jefferson checklist. CONCLUSION: The fledgling evidence base in this area provides an opportunity to promote improved economic evaluation methods in line with repeated calls for economic evidence alongside effectiveness evidence in these settings.

Adverse drug reactions (A.D.R.) are associated with ZOL-therapy, whose mechanics are unknown. ZOL is a nitrogen-containing molecule whose structure shows similarities with nucleotides, ligands of ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channels. We investigated the action of ZOL by performing in vitro patch-clamp experiments on native KATP channels in murine skeletal muscle fibers, bone cells, and recombinant subunits in cell lines, and by in silico docking the nucleotide site on KIR and SUR, as well as the glibenclamide site. ZOL fully inhibited the KATP currents recorded in excised macro-patches from Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and Soleus (SOL) muscle fibers with an IC(50) of 1.2 ± 1.4 × 10(−6) and 2.1 ± 3.7 × 10(−10) M, respectively, and the KATP currents recorded in cell-attached patches from primary long bone cells with an IC(50) of 1.6 ± 2.8 × 10(−10) M. ZOL fully inhibited a whole-cell KATP channel current of recombinant KIR6.1-SUR2B and KIR6.2-SUR2A subunits expressed in HEK293 cells with an IC(50) of 3.9 ± 2.7 × 10(−10) M and 7.1 ± 3.1 × 10(−6) M, respectively. The rank order of potency in inhibiting the KATP currents was: KIR6.1-SUR2B/SOL-KATP/osteoblast-KATP > KIR6.2-SUR2A/EDL-KATP >>> KIR6.2-SUR1 and KIR6.1-SUR1. Docking investigation revealed that the drug binds to the ADP/ATP sites on KIR6.1/2 and SUR2A/B and on the sulfonylureas site showing low binding energy <6 Kcal/mol for the KIR6.1/2-SUR2 subunits vs. the <4 Kcal/mol for the KIR6.2-SUR1. The IC(50) of ZOL to inhibit the KIR6.1/2-SUR2A/B channels were correlated with its musculoskeletal and cardiovascular risks. We first showed that ZOL blocks at subnanomolar concentration musculoskeletal KATP channels and cardiac and vascular KIR6.2/1-SUR2 channels.","Maqoud, Fatima; Scala, Rosa; Tragni, Vincenzo; Pierri, Ciro Leonardo; Perrone, Maria Grazia; Scilimati, Antonio; Tricarico, Domenico",Pharmaceutics,548,4

They are the only mammals capable of powered flight and have many unique characteristics, including long lifespans, echolocation, and hibernation, and play key roles in insect control, pollination, and seed dispersal. The role of bats as natural reservoirs of a variety of high-profile viruses that are highly pathogenic in other susceptible species yet cause no clinical disease in bats has led to a resurgence of interest in their immune systems. Equally compelling is the urgency to understand the immune mechanisms responsible for the susceptibility of bats to the fungus responsible for white syndrome, which threatens to wipe out a number of species of North American bats.

It causes dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome in patients. Each year, 390 million people are estimated to be infected by four serotypes of dengue virus, creating a great burden on global public health and local economy. So far, no antiviral drug is available for dengue disease, and the newly licensed vaccine is far from satisfactory. One large obstacle for dengue vaccine and drug development is the lack of suitable small animal models. Although some DENV infection models have been developed, only a small number of viral strains can infect immunodeficient mice. In this study, with biologically cloned viruses from a single clinical isolate, we have established two mouse models of DENV infection, one is severe lethal infection in immunocompromised mice, and the other resembles self-limited disease manifestations in Balb/c mice with transient blockage of type I IFN responses. This study not only offers new small animal models of dengue viral infection, but also provides new viral variants for further investigations on dengue viral pathogenesis.","Zheng, Zhihang; Li, Min; Liu, Zhihua; Jin, Xia; Sun, Jin",Virol Sin,548,4

METHODS: From January 2009 to February 2018, 100 patients with gastric varices caused by portal hypertension who underwent Sp + Dev (n = 45) or BRTO (n = 55) were included. Overall survival (OS) and the rebleeding rate were calculated using the inverse probability of a treatment weighting-adjusted log-rank test. Independent risk factors were identified by Cox regression analysis. Changes in liver function and adverse events after the procedures were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients in the Sp + Dev group tended to have lower platelet counts than those in the BRTO group, but liver function did not differ between these groups. The 5-year OS rates for the Sp + Dev and BRTO groups were 73.4 and 50.0% (p = 0.005), respectively. There were no significant differences in rebleeding rates between the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that serum albumin level ≤3.6 g/dL, prothrombin time% activity (PT%) ≤80%, and serum creatinine level ≥0.84 mg/dL were poor prognostic factors. Although the Sp + Dev group had more short-term complications after procedures, Sp + Dev tended to be more effective in improving liver function than BRTO. CONCLUSIONS: Sp + Dev showed better OS and improvement of liver function compared with BRTO for the treatment of gastric varices caused by portal hypertension.

We found that older age was associated with more information-seeking time (b = .45, SE = .16, p < .001). We then investigated whether perceived worries of getting COVID-19 might provide insights into this association. Findings point to a partial mediation with a significant direct effect (b = .37, SE = .16, p = .02, 95% bootstrap CI=[.07, .68]), a marginally significant indirect effect (b = .08, SE = .04, p = .06, 95% bootstrap CI=[-.003, .18]) and a significant total effect (b = .46, SE = .16, p < .001, 95% bootstrap CI=[.14, .77]). That is, older adults engaged in more information-seeking than younger adults in contexts in which information-seeking was personally relevant as indicated by perceived worries. These findings shed light on key correlates of information-seeking in older adulthood and highlight the importance for government and health organizations to make suitable information accessible for older adults.","Chu, Li; Pauly, Theresa; Garza, Elizabeth Zambrano; Gerstorf, Denis; Hoppmann, Christiane",Innov Aging,548,16

MATERIALS & METHODS: We conducted an observational study in a tertiary referral centre. Data was collected from patients (≥16 years) with a diagnosis of AA between 1st November 2019 to 10th March 2020 (pre-COVID period) and 10th March 2020 to 5th July 2020 (COVID period). RESULTS: A total of 116 patients in the pre-COVID period were included versus 91 in the COVID period. 43.1% (n = 50) of patients pre-COVID were classified as ASA 2 compared to 26.4% (n = 24) during the COVID period (p-value=0.042). 72.5% (n = 66) of the patients during the COVID period scored as high risk using the Alvarado score compared to 24.1% (n = 28) in the pre-COVID period (p-value<0.001). We observed a significant increase in radiological evaluation, 69.8% versus 87.5% of patients had a CT in the pre-COVID and COVID periods respectively (p-value=0.008). 94.9% of patients were managed operatively in the pre-COVID period compared to 60.4% in the COVID period (p-value<0.001). We observed more open appendicectomies (37.3% versus 0.9%; p-value<0.001) during the COVID period compared to the pre-COVID period.

In this study, two CCoV isolates were successfully propagated from 53 CCoV-positive clinical specimens by serial passaging in A-72 cells. These two strains, CCoV JS1706 and CCoV JS1712, caused cytopathic effects in A-72 cells. The sizes of virus plaque formed by them differed in early passages. Electron microscopy revealed a large quantity of typical coronavirus particles with 80–120 nm in diameter in cell culture media and cytoplasm of infected cells, in which they appeared as inclusion bodies. RT-PCR analysis of S gene indicated that these two isolates were belonged to CCoV IIa subtype. Homology of RdRp, S, M and N proteins between the two strains were 100, 99.6, 99.2 and 100.0%, respectively, whereas they were 99.4–100%, 83.1–95.2%, 88.5–99.2% and 91.9–99.7% identity compared to CCoV II reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis of RdRp, S, M and N protein showed that they were closely related to CCoV II strains. These two subtype IIa isolates will be useful for evaluating the pathogenesis and evolution of CCoV and for developing diagnostic reagents and vaccines.","Gan, Junji; Tang, Ye; Lv, Haifeng; Xiong, Wenbin; Tian, Xiaoyan",Animal Diseases,548,0

This study endeavored to investigate teachers’ CBA practices and factors that might exert influences on them. A purposive sample of three EFL teachers from two primary schools participated in this case study. Our thematic analysis revealed that the potential of CBA in supporting young EFL learners’ learning had not been fulfilled. The teachers failed to clarify such objectives and success criteria to their students. Despite the use of multiple assessments, the teachers relied heavily on formal assessments, with student-involving assessments being less frequently used. Moreover, there was a heavy reliance on norm-referenced assessment and evaluative feedback. It was also found that teachers’ CBA practices faced complex challenges related to teacher, student, context and system factors. Practical implications for how CBA can be effectively implemented in similar EFL contexts are discussed.","Yan, Qiaozhen; Zhang, Lawrence Jun; Cheng, Xiaolong",Asia-Pacific Edu Res,548,1

The main media-related concerns from 1990 to 2000 were freedom of the press, autonomy of journalism and censorship. The liberalization of the media market that started in 2000, led to proliferation of media outlets and galloping commercialization of media ownership and content. The next big change came with digitalization that fundamentally altered media habits of Croatian audiences. Television was preceded by online media as the main source of news while the press registers constant decline in readership, trust and advertising revenues. Radio remains the most trusted medium, as opposed to social media that are the least trusted source of information. Nevertheless, the level of trust in social networks in Croatia is considerably higher than the EU average. The data on media freedom and journalistic autonomy indicate that Croatia has made significant progress in this respect in the past thirty years. Although problems related to freedom, autonomy and political pressure persist, the biggest threat to journalism nowadays seems to come from within the profession. Commercialization, coupled with digitalization and merciless struggle for survival, eventually led news media to succumb to tabloid-style journalism and to radically downplay their professional standards. Although the role of the media as a social corrective remains undisputed, such media practices seem to cultivate ‘media fatigue’ and foster distrust in political institutions. In such an ethically challenging environment, the newsrooms and professional organizations remain for the most part silent about eroding professional standards.","Grbeša, Marijana; Volarević, Marija",Publizistik,548,20

Endoluminal vacuum therapy (EVT) is an emerging treatment strategy which may reduce morbidity and mortality compared to traditional treatments in this patient group. We report the outcomes for patients with esophageal leaks from a range of different causes that were treated with EVT in a tertiary UK hospital over a 10-year period. METHODS: Between April 2011 and March 2021, 45 patients with a median age of 67 years (31–92) who had an esophageal leak were treated with EVT. All patients were treated with an ad-hoc endoluminal vacuum device (EVD) constructed using V.A.C GRANUFOAMTM (KCI) and a standard nasogastric (Ryles) tube. The median Apache II score for patients at the time of leak diagnosis was 20 (6–36). The cause of the leak was anastomotic in 16 patients (36%), iatrogenic in 14 patients (31%), spontaneous in 14 patients (31%), and traumatic in 1 patient (2%). Information related to treatment and outcome was recorded prospectively. RESULTS: Successful resolution of the leak was achieved in 39 (87%) patients. The median number of EVD changes required to heal the leak was 6 (1–17). There were no complications related to insertion of the EVD. The median length of hospital stay was 49 days (1–108). Six (13%) patients died during treatment. Six (13%) patients had complications during treatment requiring further intervention; 2 (4%) had a significant bleed requiring angiography and aortic stent placement, 1 (2%) had a stroke, 1 (2%) had a pulmonary embolism, 1 (2%) had a myocardial infarction, and 1 (2%) contracted COVID-19. CONCLUSION: EVT is a safe and effective treatment that can be used successfully to treat esophageal leaks from a disparate range of leak causes in selected critically unwell patients. Further studies are required to develop a standardized procedure and management pathway which will enable broader adoption of EVT in this group of patients.","Afzal, Zeeshan; Gourgiotis, Stavros; Hardwick, Richard; Safranek, Peter; Sujendran, Vijay; Bennett, John; O'Neill, Robert; Noorani, Ayesha; Hindmarsh, Andrew",Dis Esophagus,548,16

In general, anxiety and poor health are higher in parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) than parents of children without ASD. However, the symptoms of anxiety, depression and poor mental health are likely to be more escalated in parents of children with ASD during COVID-19, possibly due to the emergency measures involving suspension of essential services, closure of schools, work-from-home policy and lack of professional support, etc. AIM: This empirical research aimed to explore the attitude, anxiety and perceived mental health care of parents of children with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD A total of 211 participants, including mothers and fathers of children with ASD from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, participated in this online study. Along with demographic details, data on attitude, anxiety, mental health status and perceived mental health care were obtained using both self-reported questionnaire and reference standard questionnaire. The collected data were analysed using t-test, Pearson correlation analysis and linear regression analysis. The responses to open-ended questions were also collected and analysed qualitatively. RESULTS The study revealed that attitudes towards taking care of children with ASD were affected by parents' age and child's age, and mothers were more affected. Further, the anxiety of parents during COVID-19 was significantly higher than before the COVID-19 situation. It was found that parents' mental status during COVID-19 mediated the interaction between anxiety and perceived mental health care. Finally, the open-ended questions indicated that parents sought support from teachers, family members and therapists to deal with children with ASD during the pandemic outbreak. In the context of perceived mental health care, besides psychological and financial support, other measures like training sessions, online classes, etc., were recommended. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study insisted on the importance of support from government and local health authorities to introduce interventions for parents and children with ASD to improve the overall mental health.","Althiabi, Youssef",Research in developmental disabilities,548,26

This study aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Barrel VRD at 12-month follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Barrel VRD trial is a prospective, multicenter, observational post-marketing registry evaluating the use of the Barrel VRD for treatment of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms. The primary effectiveness endpoint was successful aneurysm treatment measured by digital subtraction angiography with a Raymond-Roy occlusion grade of 1 or 2 in the absence of retreatment, parent artery stenosis (>50%), or target aneurysm rupture at 12 months. The primary safety endpoint was the absence of neurological death or major stroke at 12 months. RESULTS Twenty patients were enrolled from December 2013 to December 2014. The device was implanted in 19 patients with 19 aneurysms (8 middle cerebral artery, 4 anterior communicating artery, 1 internal carotid artery terminus, 4 basilar artery aneurysms; mean dome height 5.7±1.91 mm; mean neck length 4.8±1.35 mm, mean dome-to-neck ratio 1.6±2.0). Coiling was performed in all cases. The primary effectiveness endpoint was achieved in 78.9% of subjects (15/19; 12 complete occlusions, 3 neck remnants), and the primary safety endpoint was 5.3% (1/19). CONCLUSIONS This prospective study demonstrates that the Barrel VRD device resulted in ~80% occlusion rates and ~5% rates of neurological complications at 1 year after endovascular treatment of wide-necked bifurcation intracranial aneurysms.

Such poor prognosis calls for a better understanding of cancer-related signaling pathways of this disease. Here we elucidate a MYC-miRNA-MXI1 feedback loop that regulates proliferation and tumorigenesis in glioma. MYC suppressed MXI1 expression via microRNA-155 (miR-155) and the microRNA-23a~27a~24-2 cluster (miR-23a cluster), whereas MXI1, in turn, inhibited MYC expression by binding to its promoter. Overexpression of miR-155 and the miR-23a cluster promoted tumorigenesis in U87 glioma cells. Furthermore, FTO, an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA demethylase, regulated the loop by targeting MYC. The ethyl ester form of meclofenamic acid (MA2) inhibited FTO and enhanced the effect of the chemotherapy drug temozolomide (TMZ) on suppressing proliferation of glioma cells and negatively regulated the loop.

Methods Video-Assisted Mini-Open Sublay (VAMOS) consists of a laparoscopic atraumatic dissection of the hernia sac, diaphanoscopy, laparoscopically-assisted closure of the fascial gap and mesh placement in sublay position through a minimized skin incision. Feasibility of this concept was assessed in a cohort of 7 consecutive patients. Results VAMOS approach was feasible in all 7 patients. Median hernia size was 8 cm, the median skin incision width was 7.7 cm. Median operative time was 86 min. In all patients a sufficient mesh overlap on all sides of the fascial gap was ensured. On short-term follow-up no procedure related complications were recorded, seroma formation occurred in 2 patients. Pain medication was necessary for median 4.9 days. There was no need for pain medication on day 14, whatsoever. Conclusion Initial VAMOS results show that the technique is simple, time-saving and safe. It provides a substantial reduction in postoperative pain compared to an open approach. Through implantation in the intermuscular sublay position and minor access-related trauma, it is possible to achieve a biomechanically optimal mesh position, to lay the foundations for adequate remodelling of the abdominal wall, and to prevent recurrence as well as local complications. All in all, VAMOS appears to have several advantages over current surgical strategies.","Schwab, Robert; Sahm, Joachim; Willms, Arnulf Gregor",Frontiers in surgery,548,1

The European Hernia Society therefore implemented a Clinical Practice Guideline development project. METHODS The guidelines development group consisted of general, hernia and colorectal surgeons, a biostatistician and a biologist, from 14 European countries. These guidelines conformed to the AGREE II standards and the GRADE methodology. The databases of MEDLINE, CINAHL, CENTRAL and the gray literature through OpenGrey were searched. Quality assessment was performed using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklists. The guidelines were presented at the 38th European Hernia Society Congress and each key question was evaluated in a consensus voting of congress participants. RESULTS End colostomy is associated with a higher incidence of parastomal hernia, compared to other types of stomas. Clinical examination is necessary for the diagnosis of parastomal hernia, whereas computed tomography scan or ultrasonography may be performed in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. Currently available classifications are not validated; however, we suggest the use of the European Hernia Society classification for uniform research reporting. There is insufficient evidence on the policy of watchful waiting, the route and location of stoma construction, and the size of the aperture. The use of a prophylactic synthetic non-absorbable mesh upon construction of an end colostomy is strongly recommended. No such recommendation can be made for other types of stomas at present. It is strongly recommended to avoid performing a suture repair for elective parastomal hernia. So far, there is no sufficient comparative evidence on specific techniques, open or laparoscopic surgery and specific mesh types. However, a mesh without a hole is suggested in preference to a keyhole mesh when laparoscopic repair is performed. CONCLUSION An evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and management of parastomal hernias reveals the lack of evidence on several topics, which need to be addressed by multicenter trials. Parastomal hernia prevention using a prophylactic mesh for end colostomies reduces parastomal herniation. Clinical outcomes should be audited and adverse events must be reported.","Antoniou, S A; Agresta, F; Garcia Alamino, J M; Berger, D; Berrevoet, F; Brandsma, H-T; Bury, K; Conze, J; Cuccurullo, D; Dietz, U A; Fortelny, R H; Frei-Lanter, C; Hansson, B; Helgstrand, F; Hotouras, A; Jänes, A; Kroese, L F; Lambrecht, J R; Kyle-Leinhase, I; López-Cano, M; Maggiori, L; Mandalà, V; Miserez, M; Montgomery, A; Morales-Conde, S; Prudhomme, M; Rautio, T; Smart, N; Śmietański, M; Szczepkowski, M; Stabilini, C; Muysoms, F E",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,548,26

Herein, we introduce a new-type of polymersomes featuring reactive oxygen species singlet oxygen (1O2)-labile membrane by employing a versatile stereoregular amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(β-aminoacrylate)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers, which are synthesized through a facile one pot modular amino-alkynoate click polymerization between secondary amines and activated alkynes. These polymersomes readily co-encapsulate an anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) and a near infrared (NIR) photosensitizer IR-780 with hydrophobic characteristics in the membrane, and the resulting polymersomes show efficient uptake by the tumor cells. NIR light irradiation on the tumors, following intraperitoneal injection of the IR-780/DOX co-encapsulated polymersomes, facilitates tumor-specific release of DOX through disassembly of the polymersome nanostructure via 1O2-mediated photocleavage of the membrane. Moreover, IR-780 dye can convert NIR light energy into heat in addition to the generation of 1O2, thus allows to realize both photothermal and photodynamic therapy.

Failure to consider a range of outcomes impedes evidence-based interpretation and reduces power. Traditional approaches synthesizing information obtained from separate analysis of each outcome fail to incorporate associations between outcomes and recognize the cumulative nature of outcomes in individual patients, suffer from competing risk complexities during interpretation, and since efficacy and safety analyses are often conducted on different populations, generalizability is unclear. Pragmatic and efficient approaches to trial design and analyses are needed. METHODS Approaches providing a pragmatic assessment of benefits and harms of interventions, summarizing outcomes experienced by patients, and providing sample size efficiencies are described. Ordinal outcomes recognize finer gradations of patient responses. Desirability of outcome ranking is an ordinal outcome combining benefits and harms within patients. Analysis of desirability of outcome ranking can be based on rank-based methodologies including the desirability of outcome ranking probability, the win ratio, and the proportion in favor of treatment. Partial credit analyses, involving grading the levels of the desirability of outcome ranking outcome similar to an academic test, provides an alternative approach. The methodologies are demonstrated using the acute stroke or transient ischemic attack treated with aspirin or ticagrelor and patient outcomes study (SOCRATES; NCT01994720), a randomized clinical trial. RESULTS Two 5-level ordinal outcomes were developed for SOCRATES. The first was based on a modified Rankin scale. The odds ratio is 0.86 (95% confidence interval = 0.75, 0.99; p = 0.04) indicating that the odds of worse stroke categorization for a trial participant assigned to ticagrelor is 0.86 times that of a trial participant assigned to aspirin. The 5-level desirability of outcome ranking outcome incorporated and prioritized survival; the number of strokes, myocardial infarction, and major bleeding events; and whether a stroke event was disabling. The desirability of outcome ranking probability and win ratio are 0.504 (95% confidence interval = 0.499, 0.508; p = 0.10) and 1.11 (95% confidence interval = 0.98, 1.26; p = 0.10), respectively, implying that the probability of a more desirable result with ticagrelor is 50.4% and that a more desirable result occurs 1.11 times more frequently on ticagrelor versus aspirin. CONCLUSION Ordinal outcomes can improve efficiency through required pre-specification, careful construction, and analyses. Greater pragmatism can be obtained by composing outcomes within patients. Desirability of outcome ranking provides a global assessment of the benefits and harms that more closely reflect the experience of patients. The desirability of outcome ranking probability, the proportion in favor of treatment, the win ratio, and partial credit can more optimally inform patient treatment, enhance the understanding of the totality of intervention effects on patients, and potentially provide efficiencies over standard analyses. The methods provide the infrastructure for incorporating patient values and estimating personalized effects.","Evans, Scott R; Knutsson, Mikael; Amarenco, Pierre; Albers, Gregory W; Bath, Philip M; Denison, Hans; Ladenvall, Per; Jonasson, Jenny; Easton, J Donald; Minematsu, Kazuo; Molina, Carlos A; Wang, Yongjun; Wong, Ks Lawrence; Johnston, S Claiborne",Clinical trials,548,12

In this study, we show that IL-17 commonly produced during viral infection specifically augments a proinflammatory response by directly synergizing with antiviral signaling. Costimulation of primary human fibroblasts with IL-17 greatly enhanced respiratory syncytial virus-induced or synthetic dsRNA-based viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid-induced expression of proinflammatory genes without affecting expression of IFN-β-stimulated or IFN-stimulated genes. Knockdown of expression of known mediators of the antiviral signaling pathway revealed that the IL-17-poly(I:C) synergy depends on the presence of the transcriptional factors RelA and IFN regulatory factor 3 and IκB kinases. Moreover, this synergy was blocked by an IκB kinase inhibitor, BAY 11-7082. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms behind IL-17-dependent immunopathology observed in viral infections.","Ryzhakov, Grigory; Lai, Cheryl Chuk-ke; Blazek, Katrina; To, Ken-win; Hussell, Tracy; Udalova, Irina",Journal of immunology,548,16

Methods: In 2019, the National Psychological Care Project for the Elderly was launched, covering 818 communities across the country, and 188 407 subjects received psychological assessment. In April and May 2020, a convenient sample of 6 467 aged 65 and above subjects were followed up on the anxiety status and its influencing factors during the epidemic period by using structurized questionnaire. Data collection and management were carried out using the national elderly psychological care project data collection platform. McNemar test was used to compare the difference of the prevalence of anxiety among elderly before (October 2019 to January 23, 2020) and during the epidemic (April-May 2020). The difference of the prevalence of anxiety among elderly with different characteristics was compared by chi square test. The influencing factors of anxiety before and during the epidemic situation were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression model. Results: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms in the elderly population was 4.95% (95%CI: 4.42%-5.48%) before the outbreak of COVID-19, and 10.10% (95%CI: 9.36%-10.83%) during the epidemic which was twice as high as before the outbreak. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors of anxiety symptoms before the outbreak were with one underlying disease (OR=1.57, 95%CI: 1.05-2.37), with two or more underlying diseases (OR=3.10, 95%CI: 2.13-4.51), and the protective factors were with hobbies, good relationship between children, good relationship with spouse, positive aging attitude and good psychological resilience (all P<0.05). The risk factors of developing anxiety symptoms during the epidemic were living in rural areas (OR=1.77, 95%CI: 1.42-2.20), participating in social activities regularly (OR=1.23, 95%CI: 1.02-1.48), having a good relationship with friends (OR=1.42, 95%CI: 1.11-1.82) and were quarantined or people around were quarantined for medical observation (OR=2.80, 95% CI: 1.90-4.13). Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic leads to a double increase in anxiety among the elderly. We should pay more attention to the psychological state of the elderly in rural area and who is being quarantined or people around being quarantined for medical observation.","Wang, Z H; Qi, S G; Zhang, H; Mao, P X; He, Y L; Li, J; Xiao, S Y; Peng, H M; Sun, W W; Guo, H Y; Liu, M",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,548,12

We introduce a novel approach called Event-level Inverted Index (ELII) to optimize time trade-offs between one-time batch preprocessing and subsequent open-ended, user-specified temporal queries. An experimental temporal query engine has been implemented in a NoSQL database using our new ELII strategy. Near-real-time performance was achieved on a large Covid-19 EHR dataset, with 1.3 million unique patients and 3.76 billion records. We evaluated the performance of ELII on several types of queries: classical (non-temporal), absolute temporal, and relative temporal. Our experimental results indicate that ELII accomplished these queries in seconds, achieving average speed accelerations of 26.8 times on relative temporal query, 88.6 times on absolute temporal query, and 1037.6 times on classical query compared to a baseline approach without using ELII.

METHODS i) A focus group with 13 Aboriginal Immunisation Healthcare Workers; and ii) a cross-sectional survey of Aboriginal people aged ≥18 years at the 2017 New South Wales Koori Knockout (29 September-2 October). RESULTS The focus group nominated poor identification of Aboriginality in general practice. Of 273 survey respondents, a substantial minority (30%) were unaware of their eligibility for free influenza vaccination. More than half (52%) believed the vaccine could cause influenza, 40% reported there were better ways than vaccination for avoiding infection and 30% said they would not have the vaccine if it was offered to them. Regarding health service access, few reported experiencing difficulty (17%), feeling uncomfortable (15%) or being discriminated against (8%), but 53% reported not receiving a reminder from a health professional. CONCLUSIONS Misconceptions about influenza disease and vaccine among Aboriginal people and inadequate identification of Aboriginality in general practice appear to be the greatest barriers to vaccination, rather than health service access in general. Implications for public health: More active communication to and targeting of Aboriginal adults is required; this is even more urgent following the arrival of COVID-19.","Menzies, Robert; Aqel, Jalil; Abdi, Ikram; Joseph, Telphia; Seale, Holly; Nathan, Sally Anne",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,548,22

The emerging distribution of the multi-drug resistant P. falciparum becomes a worldwide concern, so the identification of unique targets and novel inhibitors is a prime need now. In the present study, we have employed pharmacoinformatics approaches to analyze 265 lead-like compounds from PubChem databases for virtual screening. Thereafter, 15 lead-like compounds were docked within the active side pocket of importin alpha. Comparative ligand properties and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile were also assessed. Finally, a novel inhibitor was designed and assessed computationally for its efficacy. From the comparative analysis we have found that our screened compounds possess better results than the existing lead ivermectin; having the highest binding energy of -15.6 kcal/mol, whereas ivermectin has -12.4 kcal/mol. The novel lead compound possessed more fascinating output without deviating any of the rules of Lipinski. It also possessed higher bioavailability and the drug-likeness score of 0.55 and 0.71, respectively compared to ivermectin. Furthermore, the binding study was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation over 25 ns by evaluating the stability of the complex. Finally, all the screened compounds and the novel compound showed promising ADMET properties likewise. To end, we hope that our proposed screened compounds, as well as the novel compound, might give some advances to treat malaria efficiently in vitro and in vivo.","Oany, Arafat Rahman; Pervin, Tahmina; Moni, Mohammad Ali","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",548,1

BNT162b2 is new type of vaccine, and previous studies have shown that the antibody response was significantly elevated in patients with prior COVID-19 infection after the first dose of BNT162b2 vaccination. However, no study has evaluated the efficacy of the vaccination or the adverse reactions of people with prior COVID-19 infection in Japan. The aim of this study is to evaluate the antibody titer and adverse reactions of BNT162b2 vaccine among participants with prior COVID-19 infection in Japan. Methods The data for this prospective study was collected between April 15, 2021, and June 9, 2021. All of the hospital staff who received the BNT162b2 vaccine were included in this study and were sorted into either the prior infection group or the control group. We collected the data of adverse reactions through self-reporting and calculated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibody titer for all participants. Results The antibody titer of the prior-infection group in first antibody test was significantly higher than that of the control group in the second antibody test. There was no significant difference in adverse reactions between the prior infection group receiving its first vaccination and the control group receiving its second vaccination. Furthermore, the history of prior infection was not related to local and systemic adverse reactions in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Conclusion Our study shows that the antibody response following the first vaccination in the prior COVID-19 infection group was found to be comparable to that of the second vaccination in the control group; however, the evaluation of adverse reactions was inadequate and further, large-scale studies are needed.","Mitsunaga, T.; Ohtaki, Y.; Seki, Y.; Yoshioka, M.; Mori, H.; Suzuka, M.; Mashiko, S.; Takeda, S.; Mashiko, K.",,548,23

Design/methodology/approach: Document analysis was adopted. Documents were collected from English news articles in the Nikkei Asian Review and Nikkei Asia which cover Japan's economy, industries and markets. The results of surveys by the Persol Research Institute and Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry were also provided to discuss factors promoting and hindering telework. Content analysis was adopted to analyse the documents. Findings: COVID-19 had an unavoidable impact on the implementation of telework that the government had previously failed to instigate. Japanese listed companies tend to implement telework, whereas small- and medium-sized companies are struggling. The ratio of telework has been low even after the declaration of the state of emergency because there exist organizational, technological and environmental barriers to telework in Japan.

There is a critical need for effective and approved antiviral therapies against coronaviruses including FIPV and zoonotic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. With regards to SARS-CoV-2, preliminary evidence suggests that there may be potential clinical and pathological overlap with feline coronaviral disease including enteric and neurological involvement in some cases. We have screened 89 putative antiviral compounds and have identified 25 compounds with antiviral activity against FIPV, representing a variety of drug classes and mechanisms of antiviral action. Based upon successful combination treatment strategies for human patients with HIV or hepatitis C virus infections, we have identified combinations of drugs targeting different steps of the FIPV life cycle resulting in synergistic antiviral effect. Translationally, we suggest that a combined anticoronaviral therapy (cACT) with multiple mechanisms of action and penetration of all potential anatomic sites of viral infection should be applied towards other challenging to treat coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2. Author summary We have screened 89 compounds in vitro for antiviral activity against FIPV. The putative antiviral activity of these compounds was either purported to be a direct effect on viral proteins involved in viral replication or an indirect inhibitory effect on normal cellular pathways usurped by FIPV to aid viral replication. Twenty-five of these compounds were found to have significant antiviral activity. Certain combinations of these compounds were determined to be superior to monotherapy alone.","Cook, S.E.; Vogel, H.; Castillo, D.; Olsen, M.; Pedersen, N.; Murphy, B. G.",bioRxiv,548,16

The COVID-19 pandemic, the nationwide lockdown and the subsequent new normal scenario, has made the adoption of telecommuting by different type of employees indispensable thus giving us the opportunity to conduct empirical research towards understanding the factors influencing telecommuting adoption, productivity and activity-travel behaviour during telecommuting in India. The data used in this survey has been collected in two phases to capture the evolving situation of the pandemic. The analysis has been done based on revealed preference data considering three time periods i.e., before COVID-19, during COVID-19 nationwide lockdown, after the termination of the lockdown(after first wave) and for the post-COVID 19 scenario where stated preferences are considered. In the first step, telecommuting behaviour, activity-travel pattern during telecommuting and productivity is estimated based on aggregate sample data for various socio-economic groups for the period before and during COVID-19 (1.during lockdown 2. during new normal). Next, factors influencing telecommuting adoption and productivity are determined which has been used in our stated preference survey conducted in the second phase. A logistic regression model has been developed to test the association of existing telecommuting behaviour, activity-travel pattern, factors influencing productivity, socio-economic characteristics and occupation categories with future telecommuting adoption. The findings of this research can not only provide insights to urban planners and policymakers to design sustainable travel demand management strategies but can also help employers to design appropriate telecommuting strategies at the organization level which will help to attain the desired productivity levels. Our empirical analysis reveal two major findings, i.e., a large percentage of employees can achieve their desired productivity by working from home and the ‘rebound’ effect as identified in literature seems to have little impact in the Indian context. The novelty of this research lies in the comprehension of the adoption process, and the behavioural analysis including adoption, productivity, activity, and travel of telecommuters in the context of a developing country for the first time.","Nayak, Suchismita Pandit Debapratim",Transport Policy,548,16

Preempting its highly profitable potential, Amazon has been expanding its fashion-driven apparel business by developing a series of advanced digital fashions (ADFs). ADFs intensified Amazon's omnichannel dependence based on seamless switching by utilizing its innovative assets. With this development, and in response to the increasing necessity for luxury brands to offer extra channels for a non-contact society, Amazon introduced Luxury Stores, a long-lasting digital platform for luxury fashion, in September 2020. While luxury brands confront “the Internet dilemma,” this conundrum can be solved by synchronizing ADFs, Luxury Stores, and on-demand manufacturing (ODM). Taking Amazon's challenge to realize its long-lasting dreams of selling luxury brands and using ODM, this paper attempts to demonstrate the significance of this approach for exploring new frontiers in business models beyond the current omnichannel approach. An empirical analysis was conducted focusing on the development trajectories of seven ADFs and 34 luxury brands that joined Luxury Stores by the end of the first half of 2021 by using a techno-economic analysis, analogical evidence approach, literature review, and subsequent SWOT analysis. It was demonstrated that by means of timely synchronization of ADFs, Luxury Stores and patented ODM, co-evolution among them can be constructed leading to the emergence of a cloud-based fashion platform that enables on-demand personalization and customization. Consequently, big data on customers, vendors, manufactures, global influencers, and social trends can be collected, which grow and expand Amazon Web Service (AWS). This in turn further accelerates co-evolution among ADFs, Luxury Brands, and ODM. Activated co-evolution further advances cloud-based fashion platforms leading to a virtuous cycle between them. Thus, dual co-evolution of the co-evolution among ADFs, luxury brands, and ODM, and cloud-based fashion platform advancement emerged. This dual-co-evolution leads to a supra-omnichannel approach that enables apparel to grow seamless switching and explore new frontiers beyond current business models. These findings give rise to suggestions for dynamic and resilient strategies toward a non-contact society.","Watanabe, Chihiro Akhtar Waleed Tou Yuji Neittaanmäki Pekka",Technology in Society,548,1

Computed tomography (CT) offers valuable clues to the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, little is known about the correlation between dynamic changes of CT scores and therapeutic response in the course of COVID-19. Objectives: To describe the temporal changes of CT findings and characterize the time window of disease progression on the follow-up CT scans of patients with COVID-19. Patients and Methods: In this historical cohort study performed in Shanghai, China, the follow-up chest CT images of 91 patients with COVID-19 with different therapeutic responses were reviewed in multiple centers, with an emphasis on characterizing the changing trend of CT scores for lung lesions at 13-15 days after the symptom onset and thereafter. The CT score curve patterns were categorized into type 1 (characterized by an increase to the peak level, followed by a decrease), type 2 (characterized by a steady change without an obvious peak), and type 3 (characterized by a progressive increase). Results: The CT scores of the progression group (n = 9) with a longer time to the peak were significantly higher than those of the non-progression group (n = 82) on the first day and days 13-15 (P < 0.05), except for the median CT scores before days 13-15. The CT curve type 1 and type 2 were commonly observed in the non-progression group (63.4% and 36.6%, respectively), while type 3 was more common in the progression group (88.9%). Conclusion: Most patients with COVID-19 show favorable responses to clinical treatments in Shanghai. Thirteen to fifteen days after the symptom onset can be considered as a turning point for the therapeutic response. The CT curve type 3 usually represents a poor response. The CT scores of patients with different therapeutic responses may overlap before days 13-15. The changing trend of longitudinal CT scores may contribute to the prediction of disease progression.","Zhu, J.; Tang, C.; Shi, Y.; Zhan, S.; Wang, S.; Song, L.; Shao, Z.; Tang, G.; Zhang, L.",Iranian Journal of Radiology,548,16

Using data collected in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), the Republic of Korea, Japan, Italy, the United Kingdom (UK), and the four biggest states of the United States (US) in April 2020, we find that the financial effects (represented by employment and income change) and nonfinancial effects (represented by experiencing negative nonfinancial effects including mental health issues and enjoying positive benefits) caused by nonpharmaceutical measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 are associated with individual subjective well-being. Moreover, positive benefits could reduce the likelihood of becoming unhappy for those who have experienced negative nonfinancial effects or those who have lost their jobs. The results also suggest that the degree to which people agree with their government’s approach to dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is positively correlated with their happiness.

All patients had no underlying kidney disease before admission. At patient recruitment, renal function assessment, laboratory examination, chest computed tomography (CT) were performed. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was used to detect metabolites in the plasma. We analyzed the longitudinally change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on serum creatinine and cystatin-c levels using the CKD-EPI equation and explored the metabolomic differences in patients with different eGFR change patterns from hospitalization to 3 months after discharge. Lung CT showed good recovery; however, the median eGFR significantly decreased at the 3-month follow-up.

We compared CGM-derived glucometrics during the COVID-19 pandemic with the previous year in a clinic-based pediatric sample with T1D using CGM. Method: We used EHR-extracted data to compare CGM metrics during the pandemic (3/16/20 -10/29/20) with the same calendar months in 2019. The sample comprised youth using CGM, aged 1-18 years, with T1D duration ≥6 months (age <6 years) or ≥1 year (age ≥6 years). Results: The pre-pandemic sample comprised 578 youth (53% female, age 12.4±3.5, T1D 6.2±3.5 years). The pandemic sample comprised 605 youth (54% female, age 13.4±3.6, T1D 6.8±3.8 years). Over 80% of youth were common to both samples. Mean CGM glucose was 7 mg/dL lower during the pandemic (186±35) vs. pre-pandemic (193±33) (p<.001).

We performed a surveillance study of outpatients who presented with fever and respiratory symptoms to examine the role of viral pathogens in these patients. METHODS Consecutive patients with a temperature of >38.0 degrees C and respiratory symptoms were recruited from a tertiary care HIV clinic during the period 2003-2006. Nasal pharyngeal samples were tested for influenzavirus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus using real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays. Paired acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples were tested for respiratory viruses by complement fixation. RESULTS Fifty patients (90% of whom were receiving HAART) were included in the study (median CD4(+) T cell count, 325 cells/microL; median HIV RNA level, <50 copies/mL). A causative pathogen was identified in 25 patients (50%). Even though 76% of subjects had received influenza vaccine, viral infections were diagnosed in 21 patients (42%), as follows: influenza A, 10 patients; influenza B, 10; and parainfluenza virus type 3 infection, 1. Patients with and those without viral infection had similar demographic characteristics and HIV statuses. No patients with influenza and 23% of patients with other conditions had radiography-confirmed pneumonia (P=.07). Antibiotic prescriptions were common: 70% of patients received antibiotics. No patients with influenza required hospitalization, compared with 21% of other patients (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS Although illness was mild, influenza accounted for a large proportion of unscheduled visits to a health care provider for respiratory illness and was associated with unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions that may contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Vaccination alone was insufficient to prevent infection. Thus, specific identification and management of influenza should be performed in HIV-infected outpatients who present with fever and respiratory symptoms.","Klein, Marina B; Lu, Ying; DelBalso, Lina; Coté, Stéphanie; Boivin, Guy",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,548,28

The promoter of sgRNA1 is a putative hot spot for RNA recombination in luteovirus evolution. The sgRNA1 transcription start site was mapped previously to either nucleotide 2670 or nucleotide 2769 of BYDV genomic RNA (gRNA) in two independent studies. Our data support the former initiation site. The boundaries of the sgRNA1 promoter map between nucleotides 2595 and 2692 on genomic RNA. Computer prediction, phylogenetic comparison, and structural probing revealed two stem-loops (SL1 and SL2) in the sgRNA1 promoter region on the negative strand. Promoter function was analyzed by inoculating protoplasts with a full-length infectious clone of the BYDV genome containing mutations in the sgRNA promoter. Because the promoter is located in an essential coding region of the replicase gene, we duplicated it in a nonessential part of the genome from which a new sgRNA was expressed. Mutational analysis revealed that secondary structure, but not the nucleotide sequence, was important at the base of SL1. Regions with both RNA primary and secondary structural features that contributed to transcription initiation were found at the top of SL1. Primary sequence, but not the secondary structure, was required in SL2, which includes the initiation site. Disruption of base pairing near the sgRNA1 start site increased the level of transcription three- to fourfold. We propose that both primary and secondary structures of the sgRNA1 promoter of BYDV play unique roles in sgRNA1 promoter recognition and transcription initiation.","Koev, G; Mohan, B R; Miller, W A",Journal of virology,548,1

DATA SUMMARY Nurses, respiratory therapists, and other clinicians caring for patients receiving HFOV need to be aware of specific differences in patient assessment, including close observation for symmetric chest-wall vibrations. In addition, management of sedation with or without neuromuscular blockade and effective communication with the patients are essential nursing skills needed with the use of HFOV. From an infection-control standpoint, HFOV is considered a high-risk respiratory procedure because of the inability to effectively filter all respiratory secretions. Appropriate infection-control precautions, including patient location and use of personal protective equipment, need to be considered when implementing HFOV in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS Important infection-control and nursing issues exist that are specific to the use of HFOV.

The mutant spectrum was characterized by nucleotide sequencing of three virus genomic regions (internal ribosome entry site; region between the two AUG initiation codons; VP1-coding region) from 70 biological clones (virus from individual plaques formed on BHK-21 cell monolayers) and 70 molecular clones (RT--PCR products cloned in E. coli). The biological and molecular clones provided statistically indistinguishable definitions of the mutant spectrum with regard to the distribution of mutations among the three genomic regions analysed and with regard to the types of mutations, mutational hot-spots and mutation frequencies. Therefore, the molecular cloning procedure employed provides a simple protocol for the characterization of mutant spectra of viruses that do not grow in cell culture. The number of mutations found repeated among the clones analysed was higher than expected from the mean mutation frequencies. Some components of the mutant spectrum reflected genomes that were dominant in the prior evolutionary history of the virus (previous passages), confirming the presence of memory genomes in virus quasispecies. Other components of the mutant spectrum were genomes that became dominant at a later stage of evolution, suggesting a predictive value of mutant spectrum analysis with regard to the outcome of virus evolution.

The aim of this study was to clarify the safety and usefulness of the SILS-TAPP procedure compared with standard laparoscopic TAPP and TEPP (totally extra-peritoneal pre-peritoneal) procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS 85 patients underwent laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs (TEPP, 30 patients; TAPP, 20 patients; SILS-TAPP, 35 patients) from 2007 to 2011. The operative outcomes of the three groups were compared. RESULTS There was no difference in the patients' characteristics among the three groups. The TEPP Group had a longer operation time. One patient in the SILS-TAPP group had an intraoperative complication. One patient in the TAPP group had a postoperative complication, and one patient had ileus and one had an umbilical hernia in the SILS-TAPP group. The postoperative hospital stay was not significantly different among the three groups. There were no recurrences in the TEPP group, 1 case of recurrence (5.0%) in the TAPP group, and 1 case (2.9%) in the SILS-TAPP group.

Recently, the Carillon system (CS) has also been shown to significantly reduce FMR. However, whether this beneficial effect of CS also translates into a survival benefit comparable to the MC system has not been investigated so far. The aim of the study was to compare the course of FMR grade and mortality after MC or CS in a retrospective, non-randomized, single-center analysis. Material and methods: A hundred and fifty-four patients with symptomatic FMR 2+ were included in this study (MC: n = 117, CS: n = 37). Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between groups. Results and conclusions: Initially, the degree of FMR was reduced in the MC group from 2.9 ±0.3 to 1.7 ±0.7 and from 2.7 ±0.5 to 2.1 ±0.7 in the CS group, p within and between groups < 0.01. Within 6 months, FMR remained reduced in the MC group (1.83 ±0.6) and CS group (2.1 ±0.7). One-year survival was 34.8% in the MC group and 54.8% in the CS group (p = 0.663). Median long-term survival was 1.66 years in the MC group and 3.92 years in the CS group, log rank p = 0.001.","Heyl, Stephan; Nikkhoo, Aria; Wieszner, Markus; Fichtlscherer, Stephan; Seeger, Florian; Assmus, Birgit; Luu, Brigitte; Hemmann, Katrin; Walther, Claudia; Honold, Joerg",Arch Med Sci Atheroscler Dis,548,23

METHODS: COVID-19 test samples (positive or negative results) from patients who attended a single hospital were evaluated. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were categorised according to the severity of the disease. Data were submitted to exploratory analysis (principal component analysis, PCA) to detect outlier samples, recognise patterns, and identify important variables. Based on patients' laboratory tests results, machine learning models were implemented to predict disease positivity and severity. Artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees (DT), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and K nearest neighbour algorithm (KNN) models were used. The four models were validated based on the accuracy (area under the ROC curve). RESULTS: The first subset of data had 5,643 patient samples (5,086 negatives and 557 positives for COVID-19). The second subset included 557 COVID-19 positive patients. The ANN, DT, PLS-DA, and KNN models allowed the classification of negative and positive samples with >84% accuracy. It was also possible to classify patients with severe and non-severe disease with an accuracy >86%. The following were associated with the prediction of COVID-19 diagnosis and severity: hyperferritinaemia, hypocalcaemia, pulmonary hypoxia, hypoxemia, metabolic and respiratory acidosis, low urinary pH, and high levels of lactate dehydrogenase. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that all the models could assist in the diagnosis and prediction of COVID-19 severity.","Cobre, Alexandre de Fátima; Stremel, Dile Pontarolo; Noleto, Guilhermina Rodrigues; Fachi, Mariana Millan; Surek, Monica; Wiens, Astrid; Tonin, Fernanda Stumpf; Pontarolo, Roberto",Comput Biol Med,548,15

For some individuals, cooking may be a strategy to reduce anxiety and stress associated with the pandemic. However, the Brazilian reality is marked by inequalities in income and access to food. Thus, more vulnerable populations may not have the same relationship with cooking.

We collected a strong biofilm-forming P. aeruginosa strain displaying small colony variant morphology from a severe COVID-19 patient. Genomic and transcriptomic sequencing analyses were performed with phenotypic validation to investigate its adaptation in SARS-CoV-2 infected environment. Genomic characterization predicted specific genomic islands highly associated with virulence, transcriptional regulation, and DNA restriction-modification systems. Epigenetic analysis revealed a specific N6-methyl adenine (m6A) methylating pattern including methylation of alginate, flagellar and quorum sensing associated genes. Differential gene expression analysis indicated that this isolate formed excessive biofilm by reducing flagellar formation (7.4 to 1,624.1 folds) and overproducing extracellular matrix components including CdrA (4.4 folds), alginate (5.2 to 29.1 folds) and Pel (4.8-5.5 folds).

Since some intermittent events are known to follow a power-law, we investigated the power-law hypothesis in BS by comparing it with alternative functions focusing on flattish periods and developed a new method for detecting BS as an application of statistical model in dogs. Young-adult 6 beagles and senior 6 beagles were anesthetized with sevoflurane 2.0%-5.0% and three of 64 sec EEG (256 Hz) from Fpz-T4 via scalp electrodes were recorded. Three thresholds for peak-to-peak voltage were set: mean value of peak-to-peak voltage at sevoflurane 2.0% in each dog (AS2%), 3mcrV, and 5mcrV. The subthreshold periods were discriminated as $\tau$ events. We fitted the empirical probability distribution of $\tau$ by a power-law distribution and an exponential distribution. These two distributions were compared by the normalized log-likelihood ratio test to see which distribution was better fit. At sevoflurane 2.0%-3.0%, by any threshold, the exponential distribution became better fit in all dogs. The power-law distribution became better fit only when BS expressed on EEG. No strict threshold was required for detection of onset of BS. We showed a transition from exponential behavior to power-law behavior on the right tail of $\tau$ distributions in response to the appearance of suppression waves with increasing anesthetic. This will be a robust tool for BS detection.","Koyama, Chika; Haruna, Taichi; Hagihira, Satoshi; Yamashita, Kazuto",,548,15

A potential limitation to the use of in vitro assay data in regulatory decision-making is the lack of coverage for xenobiotic metabolic processes. Both hepatic- and peripheral-tissue metabolism can yield metabolites that exhibit greater activity than the parent compound (bioactivation) or are inactive (bioinactivation) for a given biological target. Interpretation of biological effect data for both putative EAS, as well as other chemicals, screened in HTS assays may benefit from the addition of xenobiotic metabolic capabilities to decrease the uncertainty in predicting potential hazards to human health. The objective of this study was to develop an approach to retrofit existing HTS assays with hepatic metabolism. The Alginate Immobilization of Metabolic Enzymes (AIME) platform encapsulates hepatic S9 fractions in alginate microspheres attached to 96-well peg lids. Functional characterization across a panel of reference substrates for phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes revealed substrate depletion with expected metabolite accumulation. Performance of the AIME method in the VM7Luc estrogen receptor (ER) transactivation assay was evaluated across 15 reference chemicals and 48 test chemicals that yield metabolites previously identified as ER active or inactive. The results demonstrate the utility of applying the AIME method for identification of false positive and false negative target assay effects, reprioritization of hazard based on metabolism-dependent bioactivity, and enhanced in vivo concordance with the rodent uterotrophic bioassay. Integration of the AIME metabolism method may prove useful for future biochemical and cell-based HTS applications.","Deisenroth, Chad; DeGroot, Danica E; Zurlinden, Todd; Eicher, Andrew; McCord, James; Lee, Mi-Young; Carmichael, Paul; Thomas, Russell S",Toxicol. sci,548,16

This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of surgical smoke during open surgery or laparoscopic surgery for colorectal disease. METHODS: This study quantitated particulate matter (PM) counts as part of surgical smoke in 31 consecutive patients who underwent colectomy at the Niigata City General Hospital using a laser particle counter. Particles were graded by size as &#8804; 2.5 µm PM (PM2.5) or > 2.5 µm PM (large PM). Operative procedures were categorized as either open surgery (n = 14) or laparoscopic surgery (n = 17). RESULTS: The median patient age was 72 (range 41-89) years and 58.1% were male. The total PM2.5, PM2.5 per hour, and maximum PM2.5 per minute counts during operation were significantly higher in open surgery than in laparoscopic surgery (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.029, respectively).

In Italy, available data highlight that general practitioners (GPs) are, apparently, the most heavily affected group. Indeed, they currently represent 44.1% of the total COVID-19 related death cases occurred among physicians, whereas they constitute about 15% of the total number of doctors. This high proportion is most likely the consequence of a work-related contagion happening especially during the first weeks of the epidemic, and persisting also in the following weeks, after the national lockdown. There are various reasons for these higher contagion rates: GPs perform a lot of medical examinations daily, usually in close contact with patients. Especially at the beginning of the epidemic, GPs might have had scant information on the specific safety procedures for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g., there was limited knowledge on the possibility of contagions deriving from asymptomatic patients) and, moreover, the availability of personal protective equipment was insufficient. Furthermore, the risk of infection is highly increased by the virus' characteristics, like its survival for several hours/days on different surfaces and its persistence in the air after an aerosolization process, with possibilities to be transmitted over distances longer than two meters. Following these observations, and considering the high cost in term of GPs' lives, the COVID-19 pandemic will probably revolutionize the approach to patients in general practice. Clear and effective guidelines are absolutely and urgently needed for the refinement of adequate measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections among GPs.","Modenese, Alberto; Gobba, Fabriziomaria",,548,20

This perception has attracted attention in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) due to their fragile health systems and economies. The objective of this study was to understand how residents in Malawi perceived COVID-19, to determine the factors related to KAP. METHODS: A semi-structured questionnaire was used for the data collection. A field-based survey was conducted among adult residents in Lilongwe, Malawi. Descriptive statistic, linear regression, the Chi-square test, and Pearson's correlation statistics were used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 580 questionnaires were involved. The mean knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores were 10 (SD = ±3, range: 3-19), 16 (SD = ±4, range: 5-25), and 2 (SD = ±1, range: 0-5), respectively. Lack of money and resources (39%) was the biggest challenge for people who practice prevention measures. Among the participants, the radio (70%) and friends/family (56%) were the main sources of information. A higher economic status was associated with better KAP. CONCLUSIONS: A low level of KAP was detected among the population. The people faced challenges regarding a lack of necessary preventive resources and formal information channels. The situation was worse considering vulnerable population who had low economic status. Further all-round health education is urgently needed along with providing adequate health supplies and ensuring proper information management.","Li, Yutong; Liu, Guangqi; Egolet, Robert Okia; Yang, Runqing; Huang, Yangmu; Zheng, Zhijie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),548,26

Here, we report a computation-based workflow for efficiently selecting a subset of FDA-approved drugs that can potentially bind to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease MPRO. The workflow started with docking (using Autodock Vina) each of 1615 FDA-approved drugs to the MPRO active site. This step selected 62 candidates with docking energies lower than -8.5 kcal/mol. Then, the 62 docked protein-drug complexes were subjected to 100 ns of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in a molecular mechanics (MM) force field (CHARMM36). This step reduced the candidate pool to 26, based on the root-mean-square-deviations (RMSDs) of the drug molecules in the trajectories. Finally, we modeled the 26 drug molecules by a pseudoquantum mechanical (ANI) force field and ran 5 ns hybrid ANI/MM MD simulations of the 26 protein-drug complexes. ANI was trained by neural network models on quantum mechanical density functional theory (wB97X/6-31G(d)) data points. An RMSD cutoff winnowed down the pool to 12, and free energy analysis (MM/PBSA) produced the final selection of 9 drugs: dihydroergotamine, midostaurin, ziprasidone, etoposide, apixaban, fluorescein, tadalafil, rolapitant, and palbociclib. Of these, three are found to be active in literature reports of experimental studies. To provide physical insight into their mechanism of action, the interactions of the drug molecules with the protein are presented as 2D-interaction maps. These findings and mappings of drug-protein interactions may be potentially used to guide rational drug discovery against COVID-19.","Gupta, Aayush; Zhou, Huan-Xiang",ACS Comb Sci,548,16

In this study, we used the single-cell V(D)J sequencing to characterize the BCR repertoire across convalescent COVID-19 patients. We observed that the BCR diversity was significantly reduced in disease compared with healthy controls. And BCRs tend to skew toward different V gene segments in COVID-19 and healthy controls. The CDR3 sequences of heavy chain in clonal BCRs in patients were more convergent than that in healthy controls. In addition, we discovered increased IgG and IgA isotypes in the disease, including IgG1, IgG3 and IgA1. In all clonal BCRs, IgG isotypes had the most frequent class switch recombination events and the highest somatic hypermutation rate, especially IgG3. Moreover, we found that an IgG3 cluster from different clonal groups had the same IGHV, IGHJ and CDR3 sequences (IGHV4-4-CARLANTNQFYDSSSYLNAMDVW-IGHJ6).

Therefore, RdRp is among the most suitable targets in RNA viruses. Our aim was to investigate the FDA approved antiviral drugs having potential to inhibit the viral replication. The methodology adopted was virtual screening and docking of FDA-approved antiviral drugs into the RdRp protein. Top hits were selected and subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to understand the dynamics of RdRp in complex with these drugs. The antiviral activity of the drugs against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in Vero E6 cells. Notably, both remdesivir (half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) 6.6 µM, 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) > 100 µM, selectivity index (SI) = 15) and ledipasvir (EC50 34.6 µM, CC50 > 100 µM, SI > 2.9) exerted antiviral action.

Notably, there have been multiple attempts to leverage Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to disinfect surfaces. Although recent research suggests that surface transmission is less significant than airborne transmission in the spread of Covid-19, surfaces and fomites can play, and have played, critical roles in the transmission of Covid-19 and many other viruses, especially in settings such as child daycares, schools, offices, and hospitals. Employing UAVs for mass spray disinfection offers several potential advantages, including high-throughput application of disinfectant, large scale deployment, and the minimization of health risks to sanitation workers. Despite these potential benefits and preliminary usage of UAVs for disinfection, there has been little research into their design and effectiveness. In this work, we present an autonomous UAV capable of effectively disinfecting indoor surfaces. We identify relevant parameters such as disinfectant type and concentration, and application time and distance required of the UAV to disinfect high-touch surfaces such as door handles. Finally, we develop a robotic system that enables the fully autonomous disinfection of door handles in an unstructured and previously unknown environment. To our knowledge, this is the smallest untethered UAV ever built with both full autonomy and spraying capabilities, allowing it to operate in confined indoor settings, and the first autonomous UAV to specifically target high-touch surfaces on an individual basis with spray disinfectant, resulting in more efficient use of disinfectant","Roelofs, Sean; Landry, Benoit; Jalil, Myra Kurosu; Martin, Adrian; Koppaka, Saisneha; K.Y.Tang, Sindy; Pavone, Marco",,548,13

Design/methodology/approach - The study was carried out by pursuing the archival method. The information was collected from credible newspaper reports over the previous months, as well as articles published on the subject of COVID-19. Findings - The research revealed important and relevant dimensions of the health sector in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. The major factors were doctors, nurses (health service providers), patients, (customers) and society. This is a pioneering paper, which documents the major lessons learned from the management of COVID-19 in Bangladesh concerning three stakeholders of the health-care system, i.e. providers, patients and society. This paper covers the situation regarding the ongoing pandemic from three perspectives - provider, customers and society, and thus, may help to develop future research regarding the development of health-care management models for addressing the pandemic. Research limitations/implications - The major limitations of this paper is its over dependence on secondary sources for collecting the information. Practical implications - This paper presents the learnings from the pandemic in health-care management in different categories (e.g. social, doctor/nurse, patients), which can help the managers in understanding different dimensions of the health-care sector from different perspectives. The problems as well as the learnings stated in the paper can help the policy makers implement such strategies to ensure better delivery of the medical healthcare service during a pandemic. Social implications - This paper clearly reveals the social dimensions of the COVID-19 by assessing the social aspects of COVID-19 management. Both social stigma and support are traced out during evaluating the situation. Thus, the social forces will be able to rethink about their role in addressing the social costs of pandemic.

The commonest symptoms of COVID-19 disease are fever, cough, anosmia, and lymphocytopenia. However, other apparently less common clinical symptoms have been described, including skin lesions. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate skin involvement in COVID-19. METHODS: The authors performed a systematic review of literature, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). The search was reiterated until May 06, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 1593 patients (M/F ratio: 1 : 9) with suspect of COVID-19 were examined. The mean age was 37.8 (range 0-91) years. Among the analyzed patients, 84 (5.3%) were pediatrics (<18 years). Chilblains are very common among skin lesions and represent almost half of all skin lesions reported (46%); in 75% of patients with cutaneous manifestation, the latter presented before other typical clinical manifestation of COVID-19. Vasculitis or thrombosis was identified in almost 70% of patients who suffered from skin manifestations. CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the importance of skin involvement in COVID-19. Limbs should be examined to eventually foresee the onset of further typical symptoms. Chilblains can be considered typical features. Studies with higher scientific evidence are required.","Perna, Andrea; Passiatore, Marco; Massaro, Antonio; Terrinoni, Alessandro; Bianchi, Luca; Cilli, Vitale; D039,; Orio, Marco; Proietti, Luca; Taccardo, Giuseppe; De Vitis, Rocco",Int. j. dermatol,548,24

METHODS: Neonates born between April and December 2020 in our hospital to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results during pregnancy were included in this study. Neonates with risk factors for universal newborn hearing screening (NHS) were excluded. Neonates born to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results during pregnancy were compared with healthy controls in terms of newborn hearing screening results and independent variables. RESULTS: Neonates in the COVID-19 group were more likely to have a ""refer"" result in auditory brainstem responses (ABR) compared with the control group (53/118 and 28/118, respectively; p = 0.001). The second ABR test results did not differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.618). Logistic regression revealed that birth week and type of birth were not associated with the ""refer"" result. PCR positivity in the second trimester was more likely to produce the ""refer"" result in the first ABR test (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity in pregnancy is significantly associated with an increased risk of abnormal NHS results. Also, the timing of PCR positivity in pregnancy (trimester) may be related to abnormal NHS results.","Alan, Mehmet Akif; Alan, Cemre",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,548,16

We reviewed the effects of the pandemic on the neurosurgical case volume to study the incidence of COVID-19 in patients undergoing these procedures during the perioperative period and compared the characteristics and outcomes of this group to those of patients without COVID-19. METHODS: The neurosurgical and neurointerventional procedures at 2 tertiary care centers during the pandemic were reviewed. The case volume, type, and acuity were compared to those during the same period in 2019. The perioperative COVID-19 tests and results were evaluated to obtain the incidence. The baseline characteristics, including a modified Medically Necessary Time Sensitive (mMeNTS) score, and outcome measures were compared between those with and without COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 405 cases were reviewed, and a significant decrease was found in total spine, cervical spine, lumbar spine, and functional/pain cases. No significant differences were found in the number of cranial or neurointerventional cases. Of the 334 patients tested, 18 (5.4%) had tested positive for COVID-19. Five of these patients were diagnosed postoperatively. The mMeNTS score, complications, and case acuity were significantly different between the patients with and without COVID-19. CONCLUSION: A small, but real, risk exists of perioperative COVID-19 in neurosurgical patients, and those patients have tended to have a greater complication rate.

Moreover, currently available vaccines and therapeutic antibodies were shown to be less effective against new variants, in particular, the South African (SA) variant, termed 501Y.V2 or B.1.351. To assess the efficacy of the CT-P59 monoclonal antibody against the SA variant, we sought to perform as in vitro binding and neutralization assays, and in vivo animal studies. CT-P59 neutralized B.1.1.7 variant to a similar extent as to wild type virus. CT-P59 showed reduced binding affinity against a RBD (receptor binding domain) triple mutant containing mutations defining B.1.351 (K417N/E484K/N501Y) also showed reduced potency against the SA variant in live virus and pseudovirus neutralization assay systems. However, in vivo ferret challenge studies demonstrated that a therapeutic dosage of CT-P59 was able to decrease B.1.351 viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, comparable to that observed for the wild type virus. Overall, although CT-P59 showed reduced in vitro neutralizing activity against the SA variant, sufficient antiviral effect in B.1.351-infected animals was confirmed with a clinical dosage of CT-P59, suggesting that CT-P59 has therapeutic potential for COVID-19 patients infected with SA variant.","Ryu, Dong-Kyun; Song, Rina; Kim, Minsoo; Kim, Young-Il; Kim, Cheolmin; Kim, Jong-In; Kwon, Ki-Sung; Tijsma, Aloys Sl; Nuijten, Patricia M; van Baalen, Carel A; Hermanus, Tandile; Kgagudi, Prudence; Moyo-Gwete, Thandeka; Moore, Penny L; Choi, Young Ki; Lee, Soo-Young",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,548,15

While waiting for the vaccine, as for other public buildings, policy-makers' measures to limit virus outbreaks combine individual's strategies (facial masks), occupants' capacity and access control. But, up to now, no easy-to-apply tools are available for assessing the punctual effectiveness of such measures. To fill this gap, this work proposes a quick and probabilistic simulation model based on consolidated proximity and exposure-time-based rules for virus transmission confirmed by international health organizations. The building occupancy is defined according to university scheduling, identifying the main ""attraction areas"" in the building (classrooms, break-areas). Scenarios are defined in terms of occupants' densities and the above-mentioned mitigation strategies. The model is calibrated on experimental data and applied to a relevant university building. Results demonstrate the model capabilities. In particular, it underlines that if such strategies are not combined, the virus spreading can be limited by only using high protection respiratory devices (i.e. FFP3) by almost every occupant. On the contrary, the combination between access control and building capacity limitation can lead to the adoption of lighter protective devices (i.e. surgical masks), thus improving the feasibility, users' comfort and favorable reception. Simplified rules to combine acceptable mask filters-occupants' density are thus provided to help stakeholders in organizing users' presences in the building during the pandemic.

Scientific evidence supports that cancer patients infected with COVID-19 had a higher risk of developing severe complications. COVID-19 patients can be asymptomatic during part or all of their disease course, therefore it is a compelling need to develop universal pre-interventional COVID-19 screening guidelines. The aim of this study is to is review COVID-19 positive rate among asymptomatic cancer patients since the implementation of universal policy at our institution, and assess the impact of diagnosing COVID-19 on delay of oncologic interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population comprised of all cancer patients planned for high risk interventions between April 1, 2020 - May 14, 2020 at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi [CCAD] after implementing universal COVID-19 screening policy. DISCUSSION: Nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 among cancer patients could result in poor outcomes. Universal screening for high-risk populations may facilitate earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 and implementation of control strategies. Our review demonstrated that [7.5%] of asymptomatic cancer patients tested positive for COVID-19 after implementation of universal prospective screening policy. The overall evidence supporting universal COVID-19 screening of cancer patients is limited, yet as tests become more widely available, it may be reasonable to screen all cancer patients for COVID-19 before anticancer therapies. While such policy may delay and affect the timing of anticancer therapy as shown in this report, it should improve the safety of care for oncology patients and help protect healthcare workers. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection rate is higher in cancer patients than general population and can present without symptoms. Universal COVID-19 screening of cancer patients before high risk interventions is supported by the present findings.","Iskanderian, Rafal R; Karmstaji, Ahmed; Mohamed, Baraa Kamal; Alahmed, Shayma; Masri, Mohamad H; Choufani, Elie; Ahmed, Naveed; Al-Shamsi, Humaid O; Grobmyer, Stephen R",Gulf J Oncolog,548,20

Research has found that web search activity can be used to improve influenza models. Neural networks (NN) can provide state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy but do not commonly incorporate uncertainty in their estimates, something essential for using them effectively during decision making. In this paper, we demonstrate how Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) can be used to both provide a forecast and a corresponding uncertainty without significant loss in forecasting accuracy compared to traditional NNs. Our method accounts for two sources of uncertainty: data and model uncertainty, arising due to measurement noise and model specification, respectively. Experiments are conducted using 14 years of data for England, assessing the model's accuracy over the last 4 flu seasons in this dataset. We evaluate the performance of different models including competitive baselines with conventional metrics as well as error functions that incorporate uncertainty estimates. Our empirical analysis indicates that considering both sources of uncertainty simultaneously is superior to considering either one separately. We also show that a BNN with recurrent layers that models both sources of uncertainty yields superior accuracy for these metrics for forecasting horizons greater than 7 days.","Morris, Michael; Hayes, Peter; Cox, Ingemar J.; Lampos, Vasileios",,548,21

We explore the question of whether this represents exponentially decaying dynamics or is simply an artefact of India's testing strategy. Testing has largely been limited to individuals travelling from high-risk countries and their immediate contacts, meaning that the network reflects positive identifications from a biased testing sample. Given generally low levels of testing and an almost complete absence of testing for community spread, there is significant risk that we may be missing out on the actual nature of outbreak. India still has an apparently low current caseload, with possibly a small window of time to act, and should therefore aggressively and systematically expand random testing for community spread, including for asymptomatic cases.

Due to the significant strain on hospitals and medical facilities, the popularity of web-based medical consultation has drawn the focus of researchers during the deadly coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the United States. Healthcare organizations are now reacting to COVID-19 by rapidly adopting new tools and innovations such as e-consultation platforms, which refer to the delivery of healthcare services digitally or remotely using digital technology to treat patients. However, patients' utilization of different signal transmission mechanisms to seek medical advice through e-consultation websites has not been discussed during the pandemic. This paper examines the impact of different online signals (online reputation and online effort), offline signals (offline reputation) and disease risk on patients' physician selection choice for e-consultation during the COVID-19 crisis. (2) Methods: Drawing on signaling theory, a theoretical model was developed to explore the antecedents of patients' e-consultation choice toward a specific physician. The model was tested using 3-times panel data sets, covering 4231 physicians on Healthgrades and Vitals websites during the pandemic months of January, March and May 2020. (3) Results: The findings suggested that online reputation, online effort and disease risk were positively related to patients' online physician selection. The disease risk has also affected patients' e-consultation choice. A high-risk disease positively moderates the relationship between online reputation and patients' e-consultation choice, which means market signals (online reputation) are more influential than seller signals (offline reputation and online effort). Hence, market signals strengthened the effect in the case of high-risk disease. (4) Conclusions: The findings of this study provide practical suggestions for physicians, platform developers and policymakers in online environments to improve their service quality during the crisis. This article offers a practical guide on using emerging technology to provide virtual care during the pandemic. This study also provides implications for government officials and doctors on the potentials of consolidating virtual care solutions in the near future in order to contribute to the integration of emerging technology into healthcare.","Shah, Adnan Muhammad; Naqvi, Rizwan Ali; Jeong, Ok-Ran",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),548,6

OBJECTIVES: To compare respiratory physiology, clinical outcomes, and extrapulmonary clinical features of severe COVID-19 with non-COVID ARDS. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study, comparing 130 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 with 382 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS. Initial respiratory physiology and 28-day outcomes were compared. Extrapulmonary manifestations (inflammation, extrapulmonary organ injury, and coagulation) were compared in an exploratory analysis. RESULTS: Comparison of patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS suggested small differences in respiratory compliance, ventilatory efficiency, and oxygenation. 28-day mortality was 30% in COVID-19 patients and 38% in non-COVID ARDS. In adjusted analysis, point estimates of differences in time-to-breathing-unassisted at 28 days (adjusted SHR 0.98 [95% CI 0.77-1.26]) and 28-day mortality (risk ratio = 1.01 [95% CI 0.72-1.42]) were small for COVID-19 vs. non-COVID ARDS, although the confidence intervals for these estimates include moderate differences. Patients with COVID-19 had lower neutrophil counts but did not differ in lymphocyte count or other measures of systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: In this single center cohort, we found no evidence for large differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID ARDS. Many key clinical features of severe COVID-19 were similar to those of non-COVID-19 ARDS, including respiratory physiology and clinical outcomes, although our sample size precludes definitive conclusions. Further studies are needed to define COVID-19-specific pathophysiology before deviation from evidence-based treatment practices can be recommended.","Sjoding, Michael W; Admon, Andrew J; Saha, Anjan K; Kay, Stephen G; Brown, Christopher A; Co, Ivan; Claar, Dru; McSparron, Jakob I; Dickson, Robert P",Ann.

Over a short span of time, the structures of therapeutic target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 were identified based on the homology modelled structure of similar SARS-CoV transmission of 2003. Since the onset of the disease, the research community has been looking for a potential drug lead. Out of all the known resolved structures related to SARS-CoV, Main protease (Mpro) is considered an attractive anti-viral drug target on the grounds of its role in viral replication and probable non-interactive competency to bind to any viral host protein. To the best of our knowledge, till date only one compound has been identified and tested in-vivo as a potent inhibitor of Mpro protein, addressed as N3 (PubChem Compound CID: 6323191) and is known to bind irreversibly to Mpro suppressing its activity. Using computational approach, we intend to identify a probable natural fungal metabolite to interact and inhibit Mpro. After screening various small molecules for molecular docking and dynamics simulation, we propose Pyranonigrin A, a secondary fungal metabolite to possess potent inhibitory potential against the Main protease (Mpro) expressed in SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Rao, Priyashi; Shukla, Arpit; Parmar, Paritosh; Rawal, Rakesh M; Patel, Baldev; Saraf, Meenu; Goswami, Dweipayan",Biophys Chem,548,16

The surveys were completed between April 9, 2020 and April 18, 2020 which is a period that corresponded to the first 2-3 weeks of lockdown for most participants. A demographically diverse sample of participants was recruited. A substantial number of participants reported a reduction employment status and 69% were in self-isolation.Participants reported a high degree of perceived vulnerability to COVID-19. PPE mask wearing was variable: 16% ""not at all,"" 20% ""some of the time,"" 42% ""a good part of the time,"" and 26 ""most of the time."" Using clinical cutoff on the post-trauma scale, 70% of the sample would be considered to have symptoms consistent with PTSD. Physical symptom reporting was also high. Intolerance of uncertainty and psychological inflexibility were significant predictors of psychological distress and physical symptoms. Psychological flexibility moderated the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and psychological distress/physical symptoms. The relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and psychological distress/physical symptoms was stronger among participants with lower levels of psychological flexibility. These findings indicate psychological flexibility can reduce distress associated with COVID-19.

In following months several encouraging initiatives were undertaken including nationwide lockdown, maintaining social distancing and setting up COVID-19 dedicated laboratories and hospitals. Despite fear of an escalation in COVID-19 transmission during the winter months like their European counterparts, fortunately infection rates subsided and Bangladesh came out largely unharmed. But the next phase of COVID-19 pandemic management that includes viral transmission suppression and conduction of nationwide immunization program require several urgent steps from government of Bangladesh (GoB) and relevant stakeholders. This qualitative research piece discussed about issues including an urgent need to enhance critical care facilities around the country, especially in peripheral districts; ramping up COVID-19 testing at existing laboratories in view of diagnosing each case, and ensuring vaccines for the vulnerable populations in the country. Furthermore, the researchers shed light on other issues including a need to reinforce a struggling healthcare workforce, encouraging people to take vaccine, proper maintenance of social distancing regulations, routine epidemiological surveillance, management of environment and biomedical waste and undertaking a holistic approach to combat the pandemic and its environmental and financial consequences.","Molla, Md Maruf Ahmed; Disha, Jannat Ara; Yeasmin, Mahmuda; Ghosh, Asish Kumar; Nafisa, Tasnim",Int J Health Plann Manage,548,32

Unfortunately, the in vitro activity of these drugs did not necessarily correlate with most in vivo studies, which showed no consistent efficacy. Safety is also a major concern, with these agents having a known risk of QT prolongation and proarrhythmic effects. In addition, clinical practice guidelines provide no clear consensus on the role of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the management of COVID-19.

Methods we carried out a rapid systematic review on models led by primary and secondary care across seven countries (US, Australia, Canada, The Netherlands, Ireland, China, UK). The main outcomes included in the review were: impact of remote home monitoring on virtual length of stay, escalation, emergency department attendance/reattendance, admission/readmission and mortality. The search was updated on February 2021. We used the PRISMA statement and the review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD: 42020202888). Findings the review included 27 articles. The aim of the models was to maintain patients safe in the appropriate setting. Most models were led by secondary care and confirmation of COVID-19 was not required (in most cases). Monitoring was carried via online platforms, paper-based systems with telephone calls or (less frequently) through wearable sensors. Models based on phone calls were considered more inclusive. Patient/career training was identified as a determining factor of success. We could not reach substantive conclusions regarding patient safety and the identification of early deterioration due to lack of standardized reporting and missing data. Economic analysis was not reported for most of the models and did not go beyond reporting resources used and the amount spent per patient monitored. Interpretation future research should focus on staff and patient experiences of care and inequalities in patients’ access to care. Attention needs to be paid to the cost-effectiveness of the models and their sustainability, evaluation of their impact on patient outcomes by using comparators, and the use of risk-stratification tools.","Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia Singh Kelly E.; Sidhu, Manbinder S.; Georghiou, Theo Sherlaw-Johnson Chris Tomini Sonila M.; Inada-Kim, Matthew Kirkham Karen Streetly Allison Cohen Nathan Fulop Naomi J.",EClinicalMedicine,548,9

(2) Are there differences in patient-reported outcomes between telemedicine visits and in-person visits? (3) What is the difference in time commitment between telemedicine and in-person visits? METHODS: In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a systematic review with the primary objective to determine patient and surgeon satisfaction with telemedicine, and secondary objectives to determine differences in patient-reported outcomes and time commitment We used combinations of search keywords and medical subject headings around the terms ""telemedicine"", ""telehealth"", and ""virtual care"" combined with ""orthopaedic"", ""orthopaedic surgery"" and ""randomized "" We searched three medical databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) in duplicate and performed manual searches to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the outcomes of telemedicine and in-person orthopaedic assessments Trials that studied an intervention that was considered to be telemedicine (that is, any form of remote or virtual care including, but not limited to, video, telephone, or internet-based care), had a control group that comprised in-person assessments performed by orthopaedic surgeons, and were reports of Level I original evidence were included in this study Studies evaluating physiotherapy or rehabilitation interventions were excluded Data was extracted by two reviewers and quantitative and qualitive summaries of results were generated Methodological quality of included trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, which uniformly rated the trials at high risk of bias within the blinding categories (blinding of providers, patients, and outcome assessors) We screened 133 published articles;12 articles (representing eight randomized controlled trials) met the inclusion criteria There were 1008 patients randomized (511 to telemedicine groups and 497 to control groups) Subspecialties represented were hip and knee arthroplasty (two trials), upper extremity (two trials), pediatric trauma (one trial), adult trauma (one trial), and general orthopaedics (two trials) RESULTS: There was no difference in the odds of satisfaction between patients receiving telemedicine care and those receiving in-person care (pooled odds ratio 0 89 [95% CI 0 40 to 1 99];p = 0 79) There were also no differences in surgeon satisfaction (pooled OR 0 38 [95% CI 0 07 to 2 19];p = 0 28) or among multiple patient-reported outcome measures that evaluated pain and function Patients reported time savings, both when travel time was excluded (17 minutes shorter [95% CI 2 to 32];p = 0 03) and when it was included (180 minutes shorter [95% CI 78 to 281];p &lt; 0 001) CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from heterogeneous randomized studies demonstrates that the use of telemedicine for orthopaedic assessments does not result in identifiable differences in patient or surgeon satisfaction compared with in-person assessments Importantly, the source studies in this review did not adequately capture or report safety endpoints, such as complications or missed diagnoses Future studies must be adequately powered to detect these differences to ensure patient safety is not compromised with the use of telemedicine Although telemedicine may lead to a similar patient experience, surgeons should maintain a low threshold for follow-up with in-person assessments whenever possible in the absence of further safety data LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, therapeutic study","Chaudhry, H.; Nadeem, S.; Mundi, R.",Clin Orthop Relat Res,548,22

We formulated recommendations to meet the urgent need for a consensus for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD. METHODS: Systematic literature reviews were performed to evaluate: (a) outcomes in PRD with COVID-19; (b) efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccination; and (c) published guidelines/recommendations for non-live, non-COVID-19 vaccinations in PRD. Recommendations were formulated based on the evidence and expert opinion according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. RESULTS: The consensus comprises 2 overarching principles and 7 recommendations. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD should be aligned with prevailing national policy and should be individualized through shared decision between the healthcare provider and patient. We strongly recommend that eligible PRD and household contacts be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. We conditionally recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered during quiescent disease if possible. Immunomodulatory drugs, other than rituximab, can be continued alongside vaccination. We conditionally recommend that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered prior to commencing rituximab if possible. For patients on rituximab, the vaccine should be administered a minimum of 6 months after the last dose and/or 4 weeks prior to the next dose of rituximab. Post-vaccination antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 need not be measured. Any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines may be used, with no particular preference.

Similar silent pneumonia has been documented in the infectioninduced by H5N1 influenza virus HK483 and was found to result from the direct attack of the virus on the bronchopulmonary C-fibers at the early stage and the final infection in the brainstem at the late stage. The long stay of critical patients in the intensive care unit is possibly due to the depression of central respiratory drive, which resulted in the failure to wean from the mechanic ventilation. Carotid and aortic bodies and bronchopulmonary C-fibers are two key peripheral components responsible for the chemosensitive responses in the respiratory system, while triggering respiratory reflexes depends predominantly on the putative chemosensitive neurons located in the pontomedullary nuclei. In view of the findings for the H5N1 influenza virus, the silence of pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2 may be due to the possible impairment of peripheral chemosensitive reflexes as well as the damage to the respiratory-related central neurons.","Tan, Bai-Hong; Zhang, Yan; Gui, Yue; Wu, Shuang; Li, Yan-Chao",J. med. virol,548,20

La communication comprend des messages à destination des agences régionales de santé (MINSANTE), des professionnels de santé libéraux (DGS-Urgent) ou des établissements de santé et médicaux sociaux (MARS). Les DGS-Urgent sont consultables en ligne et plus d’un million de professionnels y sont abonnés. Les MARS sont envoyés à 3064 établissements. Nous avons cherché à décrire la fréquence, les thèmes et les publics cibles des messages adressés par le CCS aux professionnels au regard de la cinétique de l’épidémie. Matériels et méthodes Tous les messages relatifs à l’épidémie de SARS-CoV-2 diffusés par la DGS du 1er janvier 2020 au 28 février 2021 ont été inclus à l’exception des erratums. Sept thèmes ont été définis en amont : alerte – information épidémiologique, diagnostic – prise en charge individuelle, équipement de protection individuelle, conduite à tenir de santé publique, organisation des soins, moyens sanitaires et autres thèmes. Les messages ont fait l’objet d’une catégorisation par deux investigateurs en insu du travail de l’autre. Les discordances ont été résolues par discussion entre les investigateurs avec l’aide d’un tiers, un coefficient d’accord inter-juge a été calculé (kappa de Cohen). La description de la typologie des messages a été réalisée selon quatre périodes jalonnées par les mesures gouvernementales : le 17 mars (1er confinement) ;le 11 mai (déconfinement) et le 30 octobre (2e confinement). Résultats Un total de 440 messages concernant le SARS-CoV-2 ou ses conséquences ont été catégorisés sur les 425 jours de l’étude, dont 237 MINSANTE, 129 MARS et 82 DGS-Urgent. Cela contraste avec les 65 messages envoyés en 2019. La moyenne observée est de 5,1 messages par semaine pour la phase 1, de 14,5 pour la phase 2, de 5,2 pour la phase 3 et de 8,7 pour la phase 4. Avec une majorité relative d’entre 27 à 31 % des messages, le thème principal dans chacune des phases était l’organisation des soins, à l’exception de la phase 1 où le thème du diagnostic – prise en charge individuelle était également représenté (29 %). Les thèmes secondaires étaient respectivement, les moyens sanitaires (24 %) pour la phase 2, les conduites à tenir de santé publique (18 %) pour la phase 3 et les moyens sanitaires et les conduites à tenir de santé publique à part égale (17 %) en phase 4. Conclusion L’intensification du nombre de messages transmis par le CCS lors des confinements souligne l’intensité de la crise, mais témoigne aussi d’une adaptation de la communication aux professionnels selon l’évolution épidémique.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Public university hospital (Madrid). PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A total of 375 consecutive patients with COVID-19 infection, admitted to a Public University Hospital (Madrid) between March 1 and March 31, 2020, were included in the Prospective Cohort study. Death was the main outcome. The main variable was disability in activities of daily living (ADL) assessed with the Barthel Index. Covariates included sex, age, severity index (Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, qSOFA), polypharmacy (&#8805;5 drugs in the month before admission), and comorbidity (&#8805;3 diseases). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes. Estimated model coefficients served to calculate the expected probability of death for a selected combination of 5 variables: Barthel Index, sex, age, comorbidities, and severity index (qSOFA). RESULTS: Mean age was 66 years (standard deviation 15.33), and there were 207 (55%) men. Seventy-four patients died (19.8%). Mortality was associated with low Barthel Index (odds ratio per 5-point decrease 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.20), male sex (0.23, 0.11-0.47), age (1.07, 1.03-1.10), and comorbidity (2.15, 1.08-4.30) but not with qSOFA (1.29, 0.87-1.93) or polypharmacy (1.54, 0.77-3.08). Calculated mortality risk ranged from 0 to 0.78. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Functional status predicts death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Combination of 5 variables allows to predict individual probability of death. These findings provide useful information for the decision-making process and management of patients.","Laosa, Olga; Pedraza, Laura; Álvarez-Bustos, Alejandro; Carnicero, Jose A; Rodriguez-Artalejo, Fernando; Rodriguez-Mañas, Leocadio",J Am Med Dir Assoc,548,1

Existing approaches to detect coordinated accounts either make very strict assumptions about coordinated behaviours, or require part of the malicious accounts in the coordinated group to be revealed in order to detect the rest. To address these drawbacks, we propose a generative model, AMDN-HAGE (Attentive Mixture Density Network with Hidden Account Group Estimation) which jointly models account activities and hidden group behaviours based on Temporal Point Processes (TPP) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), to capture inherent characteristics of coordination which is, accounts that coordinate must strongly influence each other's activities, and collectively appear anomalous from normal accounts. To address the challenges of optimizing the proposed model, we provide a bilevel optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantee on convergence. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method and training algorithm on real-world social network data collected from Twitter related to coordinated campaigns from Russia's Internet Research Agency targeting the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections, and to identify coordinated campaigns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging the learned model, we find that the average influence between coordinated account pairs is the highest.On COVID-19, we found coordinated group spreading anti-vaccination, anti-masks conspiracies that suggest the pandemic is a hoax and political scam.","Sharma, Karishma; Zhang, Yizhou; Ferrara, Emilio; Liu, Yan",,548,22

We described the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak in a large urban jail system, including signs and symptoms at time of testing and risk factors for hospitalization. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study included all patients aged &#8805;18 years who were tested for COVID-19 during March 11-April 28, 2020, while in custody in the New York City jail system (N = 978). We described demographic characteristics and signs and symptoms at the time of testing and performed Cox regression analysis to identify factors associated with hospitalization among those with a positive test result. RESULTS: Of 978 people tested for COVID-19, 568 received a positive test result. Among symptomatic patients, the most common symptoms among those who received a positive test result were cough (n = 293 of 510, 57%) and objective fever (n = 288 of 510, 56%). Of 257 asymptomatic patients who were tested, 58 (23%) received a positive test result. Forty-five (8%) people who received a positive test result were hospitalized for COVID-19. Older age (aged &#8805;55 vs 18-34) (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 13.41; 95% CI, 3.80-47.33) and diabetes mellitus (aHR = 1.99; 95% CI, 1.00-3.95) were significantly associated with hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of people tested in New York City jails received a positive test result for COVID-19, including a large proportion of people tested while asymptomatic. During periods of ongoing transmission, asymptomatic screening should complement symptom-driven COVID-19 testing in correctional facilities. Older patients and people with diabetes mellitus should be closely monitored after COVID-19 diagnosis because of their increased risk for hospitalization.","Chan, Justin; Burke, Kelsey; Bedard, Rachael; Grigg, James; Winters, John; Vessell, Colleen; Rosner, Zachary; Cheng, Jeffrey; Katyal, Monica; Yang, Patricia; MacDonald, Ross",Public Health Rep,548,16

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies. DATA SOURCES: We searched six bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Sociological Abstracts), with no limits on publication date. Eligible studies reported peer-reviewed qualitative research on experiences of aging in place in the United States with full-text available in English. REVIEW METHODS: Three reviewers independently used Covidence software to screen titles and abstracts followed by full texts. We assessed quality and risk of bias using a modified version of the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Qualitative Research. Qualitative data analysis was conducted using meta-ethnography, following Noblit and Hare's seven-step method of translation and synthesis to generate a novel conceptual model. RESULTS: Of 2659 papers screened, 37 unique studies were eligible for inclusion, reported in 38 publications. The studies were conducted in 16 states and published between 1994 and 2018. The included samples represented 1199 participants in total, with mean ages ranging from 48 to 91 years. The gender of the samples ranged from 20% to 100% female, with a median of 77%. One-third of the included studies did not report participants' race/ethnicity, and half of the remaining study samples were at least 90% white; however, 20% of the studies focused exclusively on experiences of racial/ethnic minority older adults. Using meta-ethnography, we developed a new conceptual model of aging in place in the United States as a dynamic process of balancing threats and agency in relation to experiences of identity, connectedness, and place. We found that people aging in place were engaged in significant work to cope with unpredictable needs and challenges by changing their mindset, adapting their home environment to accommodate new needs, and finding different ways to connect with important people in their lives. Agency was shaped by resources and restrictions on choice, and where threats to aging in place outweighed an individual's sense of agency, the consequences included feelings of uncertainty, isolation, and dislocation. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of qualitative studies to evaluate experiences of aging in place in the United States. The findings of our meta-ethnographic synthesis led to the development of a new conceptual model of aging in place highlighting the dynamic tensions involved in balancing threats and agency.","Rosenwohl-Mack, Amy; Schumacher, Karen; Fang, Min-Lin; Fukuoka, Yoshimi",Int J Nurs Stud,548,22

Generally, GR's anti-inflammatory effects are attributed to the silencing of inflammatory genes, while its adverse effects are ascribed to the upregulation of metabolic targets. GR binding directly to DNA is proposed to activate, whereas GR tethering to pro-inflammatory transcription factors is thought to repress transcription. Using mice with a point mutation in GR's zinc finger, that still tether via protein-protein interactions while being unable to recognize DNA, we demonstrate that DNA binding is essential for both transcriptional activation and repression. Performing ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq and proteomics under inflammatory conditions, we show that DNA recognition is required for the assembly of a functional co-regulator complex to mediate glucocorticoid responses.

By assessing student predictions of exam performance and analyzing themes from 276 student narrative surveys, we highlight the power of a careful balance between cognitive and social interventions to help students recover. Students in this study showed a 50% loss of efficacy beliefs after ERI (midsemester) but were able to improve to at least 75% above starting efficacy beliefs after instructor interventions. Thus, we also show how academic efficacy is highly malleable and is mediated in relationships. In turn, we demonstrate a new assessment model that uses student narrative writing to reveal ""invisible"" threats to students' perceptions of their capacity to succeed.

In order to face pandemic, in a period in which a large number of emergency room accesses with suspicious symptoms are expected, physicians need a standardized ultrasonographic approach, fast educational processes in order to be able to recognize both suggestive and not suggestive echographic signs and shared algorithms for LUS role in early management of patients.","Smargiassi, Andrea; Soldati, Gino; Borghetti, Alberto; Scoppettuolo, Giancarlo; Tamburrini, Enrica; Testa, Antonia Carla; Moro, Francesca; Natale, Luigi; Larici, Anna Rita; Buonsenso, Danilo; Valentini, Piero; Draisci, Gaetano; Zanfini, Bruno Antonio; Pompili, Maurizio; Scambia, Giovanni; Lanzone, Antonio; Franceschi, Francesco; Rapaccini, Gian Ludovico; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Giorgini, Paolo; Richeldi, Luca; Demi, Libertario; Inchingolo, Riccardo",J Ultrasound,548,1

Pregnancy and childbirth do not seem to aggravate the course of symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia. However, reports on optimal management of severe COVID-19-related ARDS during pregnancy are still lacking. To our knowledge only two case reports describe prone ventilation in pregnant women with severe ARDS, no one related to COVID-19. We report the case of a COVID-19 related severe ARDS in a 48-year-old woman in the last trimester of pregnancy. The patient required intensive care hospitalization for 20 days and invasive mechanical ventilation for 15 days. Pronation maneuver during mechanical ventilation relieved hypoxia and prevented mother and fetus damages, thus avoiding an urgent cesarean section and a premature birth. The patient was successfully discharged from the hospital without maternal and fetal sequelae. In our experience prone ventilation can be safely used to improve respiratory gas exchanges in the last trimester of pregnancy in case of severe ARDS.","Barile, Luigi; Cerrano, Martina; Locatelli, Alessandro; Puppo, Andrea; Signorile, Anna F.; Barzaghi, Nicoletta",Signa Vitae,548,27

Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust opened a dedicated Health-Based Place of Safety (HBPOS) in 2020, situated separately from an emergency department (ED). There was concern that this may lead to physical health problems going unrecognised. We aimed to design a simple, efficient algorithm to be used by non-medically-trained staff to identify those who are subject to s.136 powers who would benefit from medical clearance before being admitted to the HBPOSMethodWe chaired a consensus meeting with nursing staff, police and emergency medicine consultants when designing the algorithm. Case notes of those presenting under s.136 to the POS over 1 calendar-month in 2019 were reviewed, and the proportion of those who the algorithm would have diverted for medical clearance was calculated. We then reviewed the proportion of cases sent for medical clearance during a single calendar month in 2020, after the HBPOS had opened, to see whether there was a significant difference.Result37 patients were admitted to the ED-based POS in July 2019, of which 36 records were analysed. 9 patients (25%) were referred for medical clearance, with 2 (6%) requiring medical admission. 8.6% were identified as needing medical clearance when the algorithm was applied retrospectively (positive predictive value 66%, negative predictive value = 79%).Review of records over 1 calendar-month after the HBPOS was established showed 30.6% of patients had been diverted for medical clearance prior to entering the HBPOS. Of the 65 patients, 1 (2%) required transfer to ED within 48 hours of entry. No statistical difference in the proportion of patients sent for medical clearance was observed since the formation of the HBPOS away from the ED (Chi-squared = 0.549, p = 0.458), suggesting the algorithm successfully identified those patients who needed medical clearance prior to admission.We observed high rates of intoxication amongst those admitted (30–40%).ConclusionThe algorithm showed high specificity and negative predictive value, allowing for a degree of confidence when admitting those deemed at low-risk of physical deterioration, though it does not eliminate the need for clinical judgement. Interpretation of the results is complicated by the COVID19 pandemic in 2020, which was not accounted for in the algorithm, which possibly led to deviations from the algorithm in real-world clinical practice.","Berry, Alex Dalton Florence Dunning Michael Johansson Freddie",BJPsych Open,548,1

However, it is not clear how the chirality of the extracellular microenvironment regulates cell adhesion and cytoskeletal structures and therefore affects gene transfection. In this study, the chirality of focal adhesions and the cytoskeleton of single human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) was controlled by specially designed micropatterns, and its influence on gene transfection was investigated. Micropatterns with different cell adhesion areas and swirling stripe lines were prepared by micropatterning fibronectin on polystyrene surfaces. The chiral micropatterns induced the formation of chiral focal adhesions and chiral cytoskeletal structures. Gene transfection efficiency was enhanced with increasing adhesion area, while hMSCs on left-handed and right-handed swirling micropatterns showed the same level of gene transfection. When the swirling angle was changed from 0°, 30°, and 60° to 90°, the gene transfection efficiency at a swirling angle of 60° was the lowest. The influence of cell chirality on gene transfection was strongly associated with cellular uptake capacity, DNA synthesis and cytoskeletal mechanics. The results demonstrated that cytoskeletal swirling had a significant influence on gene transfection.","Wang, Yongtao; Yang, Yingjun; Wang, Xinlong; Yoshitomi, Toru; Kawazoe, Naoki; Yang, Yingnan; Chen, Guoping",Biomaterials,548,1

This model is composed of several equations expressing the number of infecteds, considering the onset after an incubation period, infectivity, wavy infection persistence with repeated infection spread and convergence with insufficient quarantine. This model is applied to the infection in Japan, which is currently suffering from the 5th wave, and the initial number of infecteds and various related parameters are calculated by curve fitting of the cumulative number of infecteds to the total cases in the database. As a minimum boundary of the number of infecteds for the infection continuation up to the 5th wave, the initial number of infecteds at the outbreak of infection is more than an order of magnitude higher than the actual initial cases. A convergence ratio (cumulative number of infecteds / total cases) at the end of the first wave is obtained as 1.5. The quarantine rate and social distancing ratio based on the SIQR model are evaluated, and the social distancing ratio increases sharply just after the government's declaration of emergency. The quarantine rate closely equals the positive rate by PCR tests, meaning that the number of infecteds, which had been unknown, is on the order of almost the same as the number of tests.","Hashiguchi, Koichi",,548,1

Medical schools in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have limited capacity to develop resources in the face of rapidly developing health emergencies. Here, a free Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) was developed as a COVID-19 resource for medical students working in these settings, and its effectiveness was evaluated. METHODS: The RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework was utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of MOOC in teaching medical students about COVID-19. The data sources included the student registration forms, metrics quantifying their interactions within the modules, students' course feedback, and free-text responses. The data were collected from the Moodle learning management system and Google analytics from May 9 to September 15, 2020. The research team analyzed the quantitative data descriptively and the qualitative data thematically. RESULTS: Among the 16,237 unique visitors who accessed the course, only 6031 medical students from 71 medical schools registered, and about 4993 (83% of registrants) completed the course, indicating high levels of satisfaction (M = 8.17, SD = 1.49) on a 10-point scale. The mean scores of each assessment modules were > 90%. The free-text responses from 987 unique students revealed a total of 17 themes (e.g., knowing the general information on COVID-19, process management of the pandemic in public health, online platform use, and instructional design) across the elements of the RE-AIM framework.

We here describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of NAFLD patients in a cohort hospitalised for COVID-19. METHODS: This study included all consecutive patients admitted for COVID-19 between February and April 2020 at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, with either imaging of the liver available dated within one year from the admission or a known diagnosis of NAFLD. Clinical data and early weaning score (EWS) were recorded. NAFLD diagnosis was based on imaging or past medical history and patients were stratified for Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index. Clinical endpoints were admission to intensive care unit (ICU)and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 561 patients were admitted. Overall, 193 patients were included in the study. Fifty nine patients (30%) died, 9 (5%) were still in hospital, and 125 (65%) were discharged. The NAFLD cohort (n = 61) was significantly younger (60 vs 70.5 years, p = 0.046) at presentation compared to the non-NAFLD (n = 132). NAFLD diagnosis was not associated with adverse outcomes. However, the NAFLD group had higher C reactive protein (CRP) (107 vs 91.2 mg/L, p = 0.05) compared to non-NAFLD(n = 132). Among NAFLD patients, male gender (p = 0.01), ferritin (p = 0.003) and EWS (p = 0.047) were associated with in-hospital mortality, while the presence of intermediate/high risk FIB-4 or liver cirrhosis was not. CONCLUSION: The presence of NAFLD per se was not associated with worse outcomes in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Though NAFLD patients were younger on admission, disease stage was not associated with clinical outcomes. Yet, mortality was associated with gender and a pronounced inflammatory response in the NAFLD group.","Forlano, Roberta; Mullish, Benjamin H; Mukherjee, Sujit K; Nathwani, Rooshi; Harlow, Cristopher; Crook, Peter; Judge, Rebekah; Soubieres, Anet; Middleton, Paul; Daunt, Anna; Perez-Guzman, Pablo; Selvapatt, Nowlan; Lemoine, Maud; Dhar, Ameet; Thursz, Mark R; Nayagam, Shevanthi; Manousou, Pinelopi",PLoS One,548,26

Several logistical and operational needs were assessed and addressed to ensure a successful program, including credentialing, equipment management, and transportation. A multidisciplinary team was included in the planning, decision-making, and implementation of the mobile ECMO. From April 2020 to January 2021, mobile ECMO was provided to 22 patients in 13 facilities across four southern California counties. The survival to hospital discharge of patients with COVID-19 who received mobile ECMO was 52.4% (11 of 21) compared with 45.2% (14 of 31) for similar patients cannulated in-house. No significant patient or transportation complications occurred during mobile ECMO.

Here, we describe the neuropathological findings of four COVID-19-positive patients autopsied at the Helsinki University Hospital during the spring of 2020. While three of the patients (age range 63-90) exhibited merely mild to moderate hypoxia-associated changes, one 38-year-old subject with obesity, diabetes (type 2), Parkinson's disease and a very severe clinical course was found to have severe ischemic injury, abundant microhemorrhages and enlarged perivascular spaces most pronounced in the white matter and deep gray matter. The pattern of ischemic changes suggested a defect in microcirculation. In addition, a few small perivascular white matter lesions, with macrophages engulfing myelin, were found. No signs of encephalitis or meningitis were detected in any of the patients. When conducting RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses of brain tissue, we could not demonstrate in any of the patients marked injury or presence of SARS-CoV2 in the olfactory epithelium, olfactory bulbs or brain areas responsible for respiratory control.

Epidemiologic reports indicate that severity of illness increases with age. However, the reasons behind the relative protection of children and infants are unclear. Whether the rationale is host-related or virus-dependent is important to determine since the latter could change with viral mutations. We review factors that could affect the susceptibility of children to the novel coronavirus. METHODS: We search publications indexed on PUBMED. RESULTS: Descriptions of the pathophysiology of current and previous coronavirus infections suggest several viral targets and immunomodulatory pathways affecting the severity of illness. There is limited evidence to suggest age-variability of viral cell receptors and transmembrane co-factors required for coronavirus entry and replication. However, the ensuing cytokine storm and the effect of higher melatonin in children are age-dependent and could explain decreased disease variability in children. CONCLUSION: We believe that current evidence suggests host factors can play a role in disease severity in children and thus may remain protective despite potential virus mutation in the future. However, we recognize and discuss avenues of future research that can further illuminate the reasons children are protected from severe COVID-19 illness.","Rabi, Firas A; Al Zoubi, Mazhar S; Al-Iede, Montaha Mohammed; Kasasbeh, Ghena; Badran, Eman Farouk",Acta paediatr. scand,548,15

In medical applications, curating such datasets is not a favourable option because acquiring a large number of annotated samples from experts is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, numerous methods have been proposed in the literature for learning with limited annotated examples. Unfortunately, the proposed approaches in the literature have not yet yielded significant gains over random data augmentation for image segmentation, where random augmentations themselves do not yield high accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel task-driven data augmentation method for learning with limited labeled data where the synthetic data generator, is optimized for the segmentation task. The generator of the proposed method models intensity and shape variations using two sets of transformations, as additive intensity transformations and deformation fields. Both transformations are optimized using labeled as well as unlabeled examples in a semi-supervised framework. Our experiments on three medical datasets, namely cardiac, prostate and pancreas, show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms standard augmentation and semi-supervised approaches for image segmentation in the limited annotation setting.

METHODS: Scoping review based on literaature searches in national and international health science databases (Pubmed/Medline, Biblioteca virtual en salud (BVS), Scielo, COCHRANE and CUIDEN) and websites, and additionally by a ""snowball"" system. MeSH terms were used: ""COVID-19"", ""Pregnancy"", ""Delivery, Obstetric"" ""Pregnant Women"" and ""Maternal"". As limits in the search Spanish and English languages were selected. No limits were established in relation to the year of publication or type of article. RESULTS: A total of 49 documents and articles were detected, of which 27 were analyzed, 18 were used, and 9 were discarded because they did not contain practical recommendations. The recommendations were grouped into 9 subjects: Prevention of infection in pregnant women, Prevention of infection in health care personnel attending pregnant women, Form of presentation and severity in pregnant women, Maternal-fetal transmission (vertical and perinatal), Maternal-fetal control of the pregnant woman infected with COVID-19, Control of the severely pregnant woman with COVID-19, Treatment of the pregnant woman with COVID-19, Management and route of termination of labor, Neonatal outcomes in women with COVID-19 and Breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of strong evidence to support many of the recommendations for pregnant women with COVID-19, as they are based on previous experience with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. Further studies are needed to confirm the appropriateness of many of the recommendations and guidelines for action in the specific case of pregnant women and COVIC-19.","Torre, Héctor González-de la; Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Raúl; Martínez, Alicia Martín",Enferm. clin.

Similarly, COVID-19 poses significant challenges to maternal and obstetric care during the postpartum recovery period. African- American women bear a disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality burden for diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Pre-existing chronic health conditions may place pregnant and postpartum women at a higher risk for developing severe health consequences from COVID-19 before, during, and after delivery.

COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown from 9 March to 16 May 2020 have potentially influenced several activities, including ECs. OBJECTIVES: to assess the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on Italian ECs and their performance during the lockdown. DESIGN: cross-sectional survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the survey was conducted in mid-June 2020 in Italy contacting all the 90 local ECs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: amount and kind of activities performed during the lockdown, characteristics of submitted studies and adoption of standard protocols of evaluation of research applications during the pandemic. Chi-square test was used to estimate the differences between territories with higher incidence (HI) and lower incidence (LI) of COVID-19. RESULTS: 258 questionnaires were collected from 46 ECs that participated in the study. Ten were excluded due to missing substantial data. Responses were divided into two groups according to location of EC: the HI (125 responses) and the LI (123 responses). Seventy-five percent of the HI describe an increase in the number of studies submitted, while 53% of the LI does not (p=0.001). Due to the pandemic and its effects on research, the 15% of participants belonging to HI territories reported that consideration and respect of research-related and general ethical principles could have decreased, as well the adoption of standard protocols of evaluation of research applications. EC secretariats located in HI Regions moved to smart working more than in LI ones (75% vs 59%; p=0.001). Where the EC workload increased significantly, it was reported that it was impossible to perform an accurate analysis of the submitted documentation, with the effect of providing a favorable opinion to studies of not excellent quality, though always ensuring the respect of ethical principles and patients' safety. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 impact on ECs has been heavier in HI territories, but smart working has been effective in ensuring EC activities and the subsequent activation of clinical studies potentially useful to face the pandemic. Clear differences arise between ECs belonging to the Italian Regions that have recorded a HI of COVID-19 cases compared to those located in Regions with a LI of cases. In some EC members' perception, the high number of studies in the most affected Regions together with the emergency experienced during the lockdown may have exposed ECs to the risk of decreasing the adoption of ethical principles and standard protocols of evaluation of research applications.","Monaco, Eleonora; Pisano, Lorenza; Nasato, Laura; Lorenzoni, Giulia; Gregorio, Dario; Martinato, Matteo",Epidemiol Prev,548,2

We experienced a nosocomial outbreak and evaluated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in patients undergoing blood purification therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 28 patients who underwent blood purification therapy at the dialysis center of our hospital from April 2, 2020, to April 29, 2020. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify clinical factors related to COVID-19 for 18 patients who were tested using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Of the 28 patients, seven were COVID-19 positive, as confirmed by RT-PCR. The median age was 77 years, 22 patients were male (79%), four patients had acute kidney injury (14%), and six patients were bedridden (21%). All infected patients had been admitted to the wards where the nosocomial outbreak had occurred. Logistic regression analysis revealed that being bedridden (odds ratio 13.33, 95% confidence interval 1.05-169.56, p < 0.05) was significantly related to COVID-19 infection. However, the Charlson comorbidity index, receiving dialysis in the same room, and adjacency of the dialysis bed to COVID-19-positive patients before the confirmation of infection did not reveal any significant relationship. CONCLUSION: Bedridden patients admitted to nosocomial infection wards were associated with COVID-19 infection, and transmission within the dialysis center was not observed. More rigorous infection control measures need to be implemented for bedridden patients undergoing blood purification therapy.","Iio, Rei; Kaneko, Tetsuya; Mizuno, Hitoshi; Isaka, Yoshitaka",Clin. exp. nephrol,548,15

Repurposing arises in everyday situations such as finding substitutes for missing ingredients when cooking, or for unavailable tools when doing DIY. It also arises in critical, unprecedented situations needing crisis management. After natural disasters and during wartime, people must repurpose the materials and processes available to make shelter, distribute food, etc. Repurposing is equally important in professional life (e.g. clinicians often repurpose medicines off-license) and in addressing societal challenges (e.g. finding new roles for waste products,). Despite the importance of repurposing, the topic has received little academic attention. By considering examples from a variety of domains such as every-day activities, drug repurposing and natural disasters, we identify some principle characteristics of the process and describe some technical challenges that would be involved in modelling and simulating it. We consider cases of both substitution, i.e. finding an alternative for a missing resource, and exploitation, i.e. identifying a new role for an existing resource. We argue that these ideas could be developed into general formal theory of repurposing, and that this could then lead to the development of AI methods based on commonsense reasoning, argumentation, ontological reasoning, and various machine learning methods, to develop tools to support repurposing in practice.","Bikakis, Antonis; Dickens, Luke; Hunter, Anthony; Miller, Rob",,548,20

However, the wide adoption of whole-genome sequencing also poses new challenges for public-health agencies that must adapt to support a new set of expertise, which means that the capacity to perform genomic data assembly and analysis has not expanded as widely as the adoption of sequencing itself. In this Perspective, we make recommendations for developing an accessible, unified informatic ecosystem to support pathogen genomic analysis in public-health agencies across income settings.

Many drugs with promising in vitro profiles become ineffective in vivo due to BBB restrictive permeability. In particular, this includes drugs such as antiviral porphyrins, with the ability to fight brain-resident viruses causing diseases such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). In the last two decades, BBB shuttles, particularly peptide-based ones, have shown promise in carrying various payloads across the BBB. Thus, peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) formed by covalent attachment of a BBB peptide shuttle and an antiviral drug may become key therapeutic tools in treating neurological disorders of viral origin. In this study, we have used various approaches (guanidinium, phosphonium, and carbodiimide-based couplings) for on-resin synthesis of new peptide-porphyrin conjugates (PPCs) with BBB-crossing and potential antiviral activity. After careful fine-tuning of the synthetic chemistry, DIC/oxyma has emerged as a preferred method, by which 14 different PPCs have been made and satisfactorily characterized. The PPCs are prepared by coupling a porphyrin carboxyl group to an amino group (either N-terminal or a Lys side chain) of the peptide shuttle and show effective in vitro BBB translocation ability, low cytotoxicity toward mouse brain endothelial cells, and low hemolytic activity. Three of the PPCs, MP-P5, P4-MP, and P4-L-MP, effectively inhibiting HIV infectivity in vitro, stand out as most promising. Their efficacy against other brain-targeting viruses (Dengue, Zika, and SARS-CoV-2) is currently under evaluation, with preliminary results confirming that PPCs are a promising strategy to treat viral brain infections.","Mendonça, Diogo A; Bakker, Mariët; Cruz-Oliveira, Christine; Neves, Vera; Jiménez, Maria Angeles; Defaus, Sira; Cavaco, Marco; Veiga, Ana Salomé; Cadima-Couto, Iris; Castanho, Miguel A R B; Andreu, David; Todorovski, Toni",Bioconjug. chem,548,20

This study examined mental health as a potential mediating factor linking self-stigmatization and PTSD to quality of life and sleep. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, 844 people who had recovered from COVID-19 were called and interviewed. Data were collected using structured scales. Structural equation modeling was applied to assess fitness of a mediation model including self-stigma and PTSD as independent factors and quality of life and insomnia as dependent variables. RESULTS: Mental health, COVID-19-related self-stigma, and mental quality of life were associated. Insomnia, PTSD, and COVID-19-related self-stigma displayed significant direct associations (r = .334 to 0.454; p < .01). A mediation model indicated satisfactory goodness of fit (CFI = 0.968, TLI = 0.950, SRMR = 0.071, RMSEA = 0.068). Mental health as a mediator had negative relationships with COVID-19-related self-stigma, PTSD, and insomnia and positive associations with quality of life. CONCLUSION: Mental health may mediate effects of COVID-19-related self-stigma and PTSD on quality of life and insomnia. Designing programs to improve mental health among patients with COVID-19 may include efforts to reduce negative effects of PTSD and COVID-19-related self-stigma on quality of life and insomnia.","Mahmoudi, Hosein; Saffari, Mohsen; Movahedi, Mahmoud; Sanaeinasab, Hormoz; Rashidi-Jahan, Hojat; Pourgholami, Morteza; Poorebrahim, Ali; Barshan, Jalal; Ghiami, Milad; Khoshmanesh, Saman; Potenza, Marc N; Lin, Chung-Ying; Pakpour, Amir H",Brain Behav,548,16

Subsequently, betacoronaviruses from pangolins were identified as close relatives to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we perform structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV and all other coronaviruses in Betacoronavirus lineage B, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with betacoronaviruses in lineages A and C, and be a key component in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with this structural loop affecting virus stability and transmission.","Jaimes, Javier A; André, Nicole M; Chappie, Joshua S; Millet, Jean K; Whittaker, Gary R",J Mol Biol,548,27

It is important to describe our experience in order to assist hospitals in other areas of the country that may soon be subjected to similar surges. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the expansion of critical care medicine services at Montefiore during the COVID-19 surge in terms of space, staff, stuff, and systems. In addition, we report on a debriefing session held with a multidisciplinary group of frontline CCM providers at Montefiore. FINDINGS: The surge of critically ill patients from COVID-19 disease necessitated a tripling of critical care bed capacity at (MMC), with attendant increased needs for staffing, equipment, and systematic innovations to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Feedback from a multidisciplinary group of frontline providers revealed multiple opportunities for improvement for the next potential surge at MMC as well as guidance for other hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Given increasing cases and burden of critical illness from COVID-19 across the US, engineering safe and effective expansions of critical care capacity will be crucial. We hope that our description of what worked and what did not at MMC will help guide other hospitals in their pandemic preparedness.","Keene, Adam B; Shiloh, Arieil L; Eisen, Lewis; Berger, Jay; Karwa, Manoj; Fein, Daniel; Orsi, Deborah; Gong, Michelle",J Intensive Care Med,548,30

In this light, targeting the knee only from the inside may not be biologically justified for the management of a whole joint disease such as KOA. Our hypothesis to test is whether any injectable therapeutic intervention alone can lead to disease modification of KOA which is viewed in the complexity of the modern concept of osteoarthritis (OA) as a whole joint disease. Therefore, we aimed at analyzing the intraarticular route to the KOA patient in an attempt to unveil its ""biological"" constraints. A comprehensive search through databases was carried out using specific keywords to add objectivity to the main messages. The literature analysis has shown that ""cutting-edge"" intraarticular therapies may offer a key to non-invasive symptomatic relief. Changing the course of KOA, however, may necessitate a multimodal approach towards the knee joint including a combination of intraarticular injections with interventions on multiple levels. Importantly, our understanding of OA has evolved redefining the concept of the disease, being in interaction with the human body as a whole. Any future conservative disease-modifying treatment of KOA should aim at a multimodal, holistic approach towards the knee joint including but not limited only to intraarticular injections. A combination with other interventions should be further researched.","Georgiev, Tsvetoslav",Rheumatol.Int,548,15

Particular restrictions were placed on the functioning of economic entities whose activities involved a high intensity of direct interpersonal contacts. Government financial support programmes addressed to entrepreneurs were supposed to help gyms and fitness clubs survive the months-long ban. The purpose of this paper is to outline the actions taken by gym and fitness club owners in relation to business restrictions imposed by the government during the coronavirus pandemic. The paper uses a critical analysis of the literature on the functioning of gyms and fitness clubs in Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the opinion of entrepreneurs managing gyms and fitness clubs, state financial aid was not sufficient for the survival of their businesses, and the regulations and restrictions introduced were unconstitutional and not based on scientific research. Entrepreneurs, in an effort to avoid bankruptcy, have been restarting gyms and fitness clubs by creatively taking advantage of existing regulations. Their determination has been tremendous, as evidenced by the fact that every attempt to seal bans on the fitness industry has been met with an immediate response from businesses.The owners of gyms and fitness clubs saw a possibility to open their businesses based on exceptions formulated in the ordinance referring to physical activity within the framework of sports activities, sports competition (including amateur competition) and sports events (tournaments, matches). Another solution was to register the business under a changed the Polish Classification of Activities code. Instead of the previously used code 93.0 included in the ordinance, entrepreneurs started using code 85.51 which referred to extracurricular forms of sports activities. The examples of actions taken by entrepreneurs operating in the fitness industry as a response to scarce financial aid from the state during the COVID-19 pandemic provided in the paper contribute to its value and originality. © JPES.","Piotrowski, D.; Piotrowska, A.

On the other hand, it has raised important questions about our preparedness to adopt and employ new digital tools as part of a new process of care. While healthcare organizations are seeking to improve the quality of care by integrating innovations in digital health, they must also address key issues such as patient experience, develop clinical decision support systems that analyze digital health data trends, and create efficient clinical workflows.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) facilitates ACE2-mediated virus entry. Moreover, the expression of ACE2 in the testes of infertile men is higher than normal, which indicates that infertile men may be susceptible to be infected and SARS-CoV-2 may cause reproductive disorder through the pathway induced by ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Little is known about the pathway regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in male reproductive disorder. Since the regulation of gene expression is mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) at the post-transcriptional level, the aim of this study was to analyze the dysregulated miRNA-lncRNA interactions of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in male reproductive disorder. Using bioinformatics analysis, we speculate that the predicted miRNAs including miR-125a-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-574-5p, and miR-936 as regulators of ACE2 and miR-204-5p as a modulator of TMPRSS2 are associated with male infertility.

Patients with metabolic-associated preconditions, such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, are susceptible to experiencing severe symptoms. The recent emerging evidence of coagulation disorders in COVID-19 suggests that vasculopathy appears to be an independent risk factor promoting disease severity and mortality of affected patients. We recently found that the decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterols (LDL-c) correlate with disease severity in COVID-19 patients, indicating pathological interactions between dyslipidemia and vasculopothy in patients with COVID-19. However, this clinical manifestation has been unintentionally underestimated by physicians and scientific communities.

Moreover, it has been established that COVID-19 interacts and infects brain cells in humans via ACE2. Therefore in the light of these known facts we hypothesized that viral S protein molecule may bind to the other overexpressed receptor molecules in glioma cells and may play some role in glioma tumorogenesis. Thus we leverage docking analysis (HEX and Z-DOCK) between viral S protein and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptors (HGFR/c-MET) to investigate the oncogenic potential of COVID-19. Our findings suggested higher affinity of Viral S protein towards EGFR and VEGFR.

However, there are still challenges for the successful integration of deep learning into medical imaging tasks due to a lack of large annotated imaging data. To address this issue, we propose a teacher-student learning framework to transfer knowledge from a carefully pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) teacher to a student CNN. In this study, we explore the performance of knowledge transfer in the medical imaging setting. We investigate the proposed network's performance when the student network is trained on a small dataset (target dataset) as well as when teacher's and student's domains are distinct. The performances of the CNN models are evaluated on three medical imaging datasets including Diabetic Retinopathy, CheXpert, and ChestX-ray8. Our results indicate that the teacher-student learning framework outperforms transfer learning for small imaging datasets. Particularly, the teacher-student learning framework improves the area under the ROC Curve (AUC) of the CNN model on a small sample of CheXpert (n=5k) by 4% and on ChestX-ray8 (n=5.6k) by 9%. In addition to small training data size, we also demonstrate a clear advantage of the teacher-student learning framework in the medical imaging setting compared to transfer learning. We observe that the teacher-student network holds a great promise not only to improve the performance of diagnosis but also to reduce overfitting when the dataset is small.","Akbarian, Sina; Seyyed-Kalantari, Laleh; Khalvati, Farzad; Dolatabadi, Elham",,548,26

Seizures and status epilepticus (SE) are reported in the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), both new onset and worsening of existing epilepsy; however, the exact prevalence is still unknown. The primary aim of this study was to correlate the presence of seizures, status epilepticus, and specific critical care EEG patterns with patient functional outcomes in those with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective, multicenter cohort of COVID-19-positive patients in Southeast Michigan who underwent electroencephalography (EEG) from March 12th through May 15th, 2020. All patients had confirmed nasopharyngeal PCR for COVID-19. EEG patterns were characterized per 2012 ACNS critical care EEG terminology. Clinical and demographic variables were collected by medical chart review. Outcomes were divided into recovered, recovered with disability, or deceased. RESULTS: Out of the total of 4100 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 110 patients (2.68%) had EEG during their hospitalization; 64% were male, 67% were African American with mean age of 63â¯years (range 20-87). The majority (70%) had severe COVID-19, were intubated, or had multi-organ failure. The median length of hospitalization was 26.5â¯days (IQRâ¯=â¯15 to 44â¯days). During hospitalization, of the patients who had EEG, 21.8% had new-onset seizure including 7% with status epilepticus, majority (87.5%) with no prior epilepsy. Forty-nine (45%) patients died in the hospital, 46 (42%) recovered but maintained a disability and 15 (14%) recovered without a disability. The EEG findings associated with outcomes were background slowing/attenuation (recovered 60% vs recovered/disabled 96% vs died 96%, pâ¯<â¯0.001) and normal (recovered 27% vs recovered/disabled 0% vs died 1%, pâ¯<â¯0.001). However, these findings were no longer significant after adjusting for severity of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In this large multicenter study from Southeast Michigan, one of the early COVID-19 epicenters in the US, none of the EEG findings were significantly correlated with outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Although seizures and status epilepticus could be encountered in COVID-19, the occurrence did not correlate with the patients' functional outcome.","Danoun, Omar A; Zillgitt, Andrew; Hill, Chloe; Zutshi, Deepti; Harris, David; Osman, Gamaleldin; Marawar, Rohit; Rath, Subhendu; Syed, Maryam J; Affan, Muhammad; Schultz, Lonni; Wasade, Vibhangini S",Epilepsy Behav,548,16

Results: The e-scouts provided support in particular with preparing audio commentaries of presentation slides, video recording of presentations, and the implementation of case-based e-learning. The main reasons for requesting help from the students were technical support, equipment loan, and support with how to use the learning platform and course management system. Overall, the lecturers rated the service provided by e-scouts as highly satisfactory and praised their prompt and competent assistance. Over 50% of the lecturers stated their wish to continue working with e-scouts in the future and integrate online activities into their teaching even beyond the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Discussion and conclusion: With the support of the e-scouts, lecturers received assistance with developing and improving their own media competence without bureaucratic hurdles, aiming to create online courses for the local teaching and learning platform.

The aim of this study was to explore the implications of such changes on surgeons. METHOD: Using a qualitative study design, semi-structured interviews were conducted with general surgery consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors from a major tertiary hospital in the Dublin region between March-May 2020. Data collection proceeded iteratively using a thematic analysis approach with quality controls such as memoing and collaborative analysis. RESULTS: Fourteen surgeons (8 male, 6 female) were interviewed. The majority (n = 11, 78.6%) were NCHDs. Significant themes determined included 'impacts' on a variety of constructs such as performance, self-reported fatigue and wellbeing. Training themes elucidated included the effects of the cancellation of elective admissions on reduced operative exposure for trainees. Senior surgical staff were particularly focused on increased complexity in patient management. New policy requirements such as personal protective equipment use and novel rotas have had implications for aspects of work engagement. The pandemic and subsequent national restrictions imposed has afforded opportunities for improved well-being but also resulted in greater solitude in surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: Rhetoric surrounding fatigue management and virus control dominates the conversation on the relationship between COVID-19 and surgery. Tipping the balance back to parity of fatigue management with service delivery in surgery will be key for sustainability of the surgical workforce.","Whelehan, Dale F; Connelly, Tara M; Ridgway, Paul F",Surg.

Due to immense variability in scanners' parameters and imaging protocols, even images obtained from the same person and the same scanner could differ significantly. We address variability in computed tomography (CT) images caused by different convolution kernels used in the reconstruction process, the critical domain shift factor in CT. The choice of a convolution kernel affects pixels' granularity, image smoothness, and noise level. We analyze a dataset of paired CT images, where smooth and sharp images were reconstructed from the same sinograms with different kernels, thus providing identical anatomy but different style. Though identical predictions are desired, we show that the consistency, measured as the average Dice between predictions on pairs, is just 0.54. We propose Filtered Back-Projection Augmentation (FBPAug), a simple and surprisingly efficient approach to augment CT images in sinogram space emulating reconstruction with different kernels. We apply the proposed method in a zero-shot domain adaptation setup and show that the consistency boosts from 0.54 to 0.92 outperforming other augmentation approaches. Neither specific preparation of source domain data nor target domain data is required, so our publicly released FBPAug can be used as a plug-and-play module for zero-shot domain adaptation in any CT-based task.","Saparov, Talgat; Kurmukov, Anvar; Shirokikh, Boris; Belyaev, Mikhail",,548,16

Inefficient viral clearance at any stage is a hallmark of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Disease severity is associated with increases in peripheral blood cytokines among which interleukin 10 (IL-10) increases particularly early and independent of patient age, which is not seen in active SARS-CoV infection. Here, we consider the known multi-faceted immune regulatory role of IL-10, both in protecting the lung from injury and in defense against infections, as well as its potential cellular source. While the absence of an IL-10 response in SARS is thought to contribute to early deterioration, we suspect IL-10 to protect the lung from early immune-mediated damage and to interfere with viral clearance in COVID-19.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plays an important role in viral attachment, fusion and entry. However, other structural and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins are potential influencers in virus pathogenicity. Among these proteins; Orf3, Orf8, and Orf10 show the least homology to SARSCoV proteins and therefore should be further studied for their abilities to modulate antiviral and inflammatory responses.

These articles not only chronicle nursing's growth as a profession within the context of the events of the day, but they also reveal prevailing societal attitudes about women, health care, and human rights. Today's nursing school curricula rarely include nursing's history, but it's a history worth knowing. To this end, From the AJN Archives highlights articles selected to fit today's topics and times.For many years, autism was thought to be a type of childhood schizophrenia. In AJN's May 1958 issue, an article entitled ""Childhood Schizophrenia"" describes the inpatient treatment of children with autism. Some parts of it are difficult to read, not because the actual treatment was painful or torturous, but because experts decided that children needed to be away from their parents in order for treatment to be successful. The authors of this article, a pediatric psychiatrist and a psychiatric nurse educator, write, ""Because the mother's role is so significant in the child's development . . . in almost every instance, the schizophrenic [autistic] child must be removed from its 'sick' mother in order that adequate remedial measures may be instituted.""

In the 19th and 20th centuries, volume changes in the spleen related to nutrition were studied using plethysmographic measurements. Rhythmical and regulatory functions of the spleen were demonstrated in the haemodynamics of the splanchnic region and were described as a ""hepatolienal pendulum,"" a ""Windkessel function,"" or a ""pressure compensation."" These studies were mainly published in German-speaking countries and have not, as far as is known, been discussed in the English-speaking world so far. SUMMARY: This review explores the historical development of the rhythmical regulatory function of the spleen in the splanchnic region. Older studies and results are followed up in the modern literature, wherever possible, up to the present. The clinical relevance is illustrated with portal hypertension (with congestive or hyperdynamic splenomegaly), coeliac disease, and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (with functional hyposplenism). Key Message: The spleen's rhythmical regulatory function in nutrition is based on an autonomous rhythm comprising cycles of contractions and dilations of the spleen of around 1 min. These cycles can be influenced by sympathetically mediated single contractions with a release of pooled blood or by portal vein congestion. After food ingestion, the spleen responds either with contraction according to a vasomotor reaction or postprandial congestion with significant increases in volume. The spleen's rhythmical function is lost in the clinical picture of portal hypertension or in coeliac disease and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. In the aforementioned gastrointestinal diseases, we recommend taking more account of the haemodynamics between the spleen, liver, and intestine. New innovative techniques for recording splenograms are required which, besides elastographic measurements of spleen stiffness, could offer an important tool for early detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic evaluation.","Weinzirl, Johannes; Garnitschnig, Lydia; Scheffers, Tom; Andrae, Lukas; Heusser, Peter",Digestion,548,15

OBJETIVO: describir la estrategia de aislamiento comunitario utilizada en el barrio Villa Azul para contener y mitigar un brote de COVID-19. METODOS: se identificaron los limites del barrio y se procedio al cierre del mismo con fuerzas de seguridad. Quedo permitida la circulacion interna asumiendo que todos los habitantes eran casos sospechosos de COVID-19 o bien eran contactos estrechos de algun caso. En los dias subsiguientes se continuo con la busqueda activa de casos sospechosos, se realizaron los hisopados en el barrio y se obtuvieron los resultados a las 24 horas. Todos los dias, luego de la recepcion de los casos se les informaba el resultado a los casos negativos y se iba a las casas de los casos positivos para notificarlos del resultado y sugerirles el aislamiento fuera del barrio para cortar la cadena de contagios. RESULTADOS: en el barrio Villa Azul entre el 22 de mayo y el 20 de junio, se registraron 731 casos sospechosos de los cuales 379 fueron casos confirmados de COVID-19 (tasa de positividad acumulada del 52,1%). La primera semana hubo entre 20 y 40 casos confirmados diarios con un indice de positividad entre el 66 y el 81% pero con el correr del tiempo como consecuencia de la estrategia descripta fueron bajando el numero de casos por dia y tambien la positividad. Se trasladaron 193 pacientes confirmados para aislarlos afuera del barrio. Fallecieron 3 personas (tasa de letalidad 0,8%). DISCUSION: la estrategia de aislamiento comunitario resulto efectiva para contener el brote de COVID-19 en el barrio Villa Azul.","Esposito, M.; Bustos, S.; Cardonetti, L.; Pueyo Alvarado, M.

The risk score is based on three biomarkers that are readily available in routine blood samples and can easily be translated into a probability of death. The risk score can predict the mortality of individual patients more than 12 d in advance with more than 90% accuracy across all cohorts. Moreover, the Kaplan-Meier score shows that patients can be clearly differentiated upon admission as low, intermediate, or high risk, with an area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.9551.

Second, counties with more nursing home residents, lower income, higher poverty rates, and a greater presence of African Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately impacted, and these effects show no sign of disappearing over time.

STUDY DESIGN: Antibodies reactive to S1 and S2 subunits from SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E were measured via ELISA in human milk samples collected from March to June 2020 in mothers with and without viral symptoms. RESULTS: The presence of viral symptoms influenced the levels of SARS-CoV-2 S2-reactive SIgA/IgA and tended to influence SARS-CoV-2 S1 SIgA/IgA and S2-reactive SIgM/IgM in human milk but did not relate to IgG. HCoV-229E S1 + S2-reactive SIgA/IgA and SIgM/IgM, as well as HCoV-OC43 S1 + S2-reactive IgG were related to the symptoms.

However, information is lacking on symptoms that persist after recovery from COVID-19. In this study we assessed symptoms that persisted in patients even after their recovery and discharged from the hospital after one month from COVID-19. MethodsThis study is an observational cohort study. Participants in this study were enrolled between 30 to 40 days after recovery from COVID-19 of [≥]18 years of age, who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RT-PCR COVID-19 disease. Outcomes from post COVID-19 participants were elicited through questionnaire that consisted of three main parts beginning from subjects demographical data, depicting about the status of COVID-19 and other co-morbidities of the subject, and about post-COVID-19 symptoms and manifestations. ResultsAll subjects have reported some manifestation after recovery from COVID-19 whereas numerous symptoms and diseases were experienced by a great percentage of participants. Fatigue (56.25%), dyspnea (74.3%) and disturbed sleep (64.3%) were among the most common symptoms. However, more critical manifestations like renal failure and pulmonary fibrosis were reported by only a few percent of the subjects. Rating of worse physical and mental health after post-COVID recovery was also reported by subjects. There was a strong relationship found in between the presence of other co-morbidities before infection like diabetes, hypertension and in disease severity after infection. A total of 280 patients were enrolled and 160 completed the survey. ConclusionsPost COVID-19 sufferers often experience symptoms that cause a disturbance in their physical health, mental health and their respiratory status for several weeks even after recovery from COVID-19. Therefore, all subjects after recovering from COVID-19 should undergo long-term monitoring programme for their symptoms and condition improvement.","Fatima, Ghizal; Bhatt, Divyansh; Idrees, Jaserah; Khalid, Bushra; Mahdi, Farzana",,548,24

One of these is the need to (re)assess the occupational risks, particularly, biological risks. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work is to promote guidance to occupational safety and health practitioners when conducting a biological risk assessment in this context. METHODS: The main steps of the biological risk assessment are explained with some inputs regarding the novelty posed by SARS-CoV-2 and an example of a qualitative risk assessment method is presented. Also, its application to two different activities was exemplified. RESULTS: In both cases, the assessment considered that vulnerable workers were working from home or in medical leave. The results showed low or medium risk level for the assessed tasks. For medium risk level, additional controls are advised, such maintain social distancing, sanitize instruments/equipment before use, use proper and well-maintained PPE (when applicable), and promote awareness sessions to spread good practices at work. Employers must be aware of their obligations regarding biological risk assessment and OSH practitioners must be prepared to screen and link the abundance of scientific evidence generated following the outbreak, with the technical practice.

Virtualcommunication via telecommunication and video-calling is moreimportant than ever, but with minimal clinician education,preparation and relevant technological infrastructure available inthe context of a global pandemic, we have recognisedcommunication as an area for improvement as junior doctorsworking on a COVID-19 ward. Methods We interviewed via telephone 22 nominated next of kin relatives of patients admitted to a COVID-19 ward in the University Hospital of Llandough during May 2020 using a pre-prepared survey. We thenprovided relatives with the opportunity to engage with video-callupdates from a doctor (with the patient's permission). Inappropriate scenarios, we used video calling to break bad news andto facilitate difficult communications with family members. Thesevideo calls were provided via Accurx, an NHS approved videocommunication system. Results Initial survey results showed an average understanding score of their relative's current clinical plan of 5.5/10, with 63% of respondents saying they did not feel well informed. Nearly aquarter of respondents (22%) had received difficult news over thephone during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 86% said they wouldfind video communication useful. Post-intervention survey results suggested a unanimous improvement in relative satisfaction, withrelatives reporting an increased understanding around theadmission, reassurance around the quality of care being given and less isolation from the patient. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has provided novel communicationchallenges to physicians, promoting flexibility and adaptation tosome of the core inter-personal skills we develop throughouttraining. Technology plays a huge role in this, and the use of videocalling in particular can preserve non-verbal communicationwithin the doctor-relative relationship and improve emotionalconnection between patients and their loved ones.","White, H.; Tuck, A.; Pyrke, B.; Murphy, E.; Figg, K.; Cartwright, G.; Abdalla, B.",Age and Ageing,548,32

In this study, we examine how maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma history relate to mothers' beliefs and intentions about the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children. METHODS: A total of 240 mothers with a mental health history participating in a parenting study answered online survey questions via Prolific. Questions assessed: (a) trauma indictors (past diagnosis, current symptoms, and lifetime exposure to events); (b) vaccine measures (intentions for self and child, COVID-19 vaccine confidence, general vaccine perceived safety, reasoning about vaccine intentions, sources of influence on intentions); and (c) possible explanatory variables (institutional distrust, negative worldviews). ANCOVAs and regression analyses were used. RESULTS: When compared with mothers with other mental health diagnoses, mothers with a PTSD history had significantly less confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and less intent to get the vaccine for themselves or their child. These effects were explained by greater institutional distrust (i.e., significant indirect effects). Mothers with a previous PTSD diagnosis also expressed different reasons for vaccine hesitancy (e.g., less belief in science) and ascribed less influence to healthcare and governmental sources in vaccine decision-making. CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the potential utility of a trauma-informed approach in efforts to reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. For mothers with a history of PTSD, addressing institutional distrust, including towards the healthcare industry, may be an important element to consider in the content, delivery, and mode of vaccine messaging.","Milan, Stephanie; Dáu, Ana Luísa B T",J. pediatr. psychol,548,25

We evaluated efficacy of the efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) verapamil (VER) with fluconazole (FLC) against FLC-resistant (CaR) and -susceptible C. albicans (CaS). The susceptibility of both strains to VER and FLC was determined, as well as the synergism of VER with FLC. Experiments were performed in vitro for planktonic cultures and biofilms and in vivo using Galleria mellonella. Larval survival and fungal recovery were evaluated after treatment with VER and FLC. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and Kaplan-Meier tests. The combination of VER with FLC at sub-lethal concentrations reduced fungal growth. VER inhibited the efflux of rhodamine 123 and showed synergism with FLC against CaR. For biofilms, FLC and VER alone reduced fungal viability. The combination of VER with FLC at sub-lethal concentrations also reduced biofilm viability. In the in vivo assays, VER and FLC used alone or in combination increased the survival of larvae infected with CaR. Reduction of fungal recovery was observed only for larvae infected with CaR and treated with VER with FLC. VER reverted the FLC-resistance of C. albicans. Based on the results obtained, VER reverted the FLC-resistance of C. albicans and showed synergism with FLC against CaR.

In clinical practice, supervised exercise therapy and education demonstrate approx. 25% pain relief following an 8-week treatment program. Studies indicate that some patients with KOA experience larger pain relief compared to others. Assessments of peripheral and central pain mechanisms has been used to predict responders and non-responders to treatment. Studies on surgery and treatment with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with KOA have indicated that patients with higher levels of pain sensitivity might respond less positive. The primary aim of this observational study was to investigative if measures of pre-treatment pain sensitivity was associated with clinical outcomes after supervised exercise therapy and education. Methods: Patients with painful KOA (numeric rating scale [NRS, 0-10] ≥ 3) were included, and examined before and 1-2 weeks after 6-8 weeks of supervised exercise therapy (2 sessions of 1 hour per week) and 2 sessions of patient education. Handheld pressure pain threshold (PPT) was assessed locally at the most painful knee at 4 peripatellar sites (knee) and at two remote sites at the m. tibialis anterior (TA) and the contralateral m. extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL). Further, computer-controlled cuff algometry at the lower leg with the most intense knee pain was used to assess pain detection threshold (cPDT), pain tolerance threshold (cPTT) and conditioned pain modulation (cCPM). Peak pain intensity within the last 24 hours (NRS, 0-10), PainDetect questionnaire (PDQ, 0-38) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were assessed as clinical measures. PDQ assesses the pain phenotype with a score ≤ 12 indicating probably nociceptive pain, 13-18 uncertain pain phenotype and ≥ 19 probably neuropathic pain. KOOS4 was defined as the average score of the subscale scores for Pain, Symptoms, Activity of Daily Living and Quality of Life (0-100 with 0 indicating extreme problems and 100 indicating no problems). Physical performance was assessed using the 40-meter walk test (40MWT). A treatment attendance score (%) was calculated for each patient by dividing the number of sessions attended by the number of sessions scheduled (twice per week). This study was approved by the local ethical committee (N-20190045) and pre-registered at (NCT04123756). All participants gave oral and written informed consent prior to enrollment. Results: This interim analysis reports on the first patients recruited for this observational study. Eleven KOA patients (6 women) with mean peak pain intensity of 6.0 ± 1.5, median pain duration 17.0 months (range: 5-120) and body mass index of 30.3 ± 5.7 were included in this interim analysis. In one subject, follow-up was made by telephone due to the COVID-19 situation, leaving 10 subject for the analysis on changes in pain sensitivity measures. Attendance score was 98.1 ± 18.1% during 7.1 ± 0.7 weeks. Following treatment, improvements were observed in KOOS4 (57.1 ± 10.0 at baseline vs. 65.3 ± 13.1 at follow-up, P &lt; 0.01), and peak pain intensity (6.0 ± 1.5 vs. 3.2 ± 2.3, P &lt; 0.001). No differences were seen for PDQ (7.6 ± 2.6 vs 6.8 ± 3.6, P = 0.77) and 40MWT (27.1 ± 6.6 sec vs. 25.8 ± 5.2 sec, P = 0.29). Further, no changes in any of the pain sensitivity measures were found following treatment (all Ps &gt; 0.15). Pre-treatment cPDT (rs &lt; 0.73, P &lt; 0.05) and cPTT (rs &lt; 0.72, P &lt; 0.05) were associated with post-treatment KOOS4. No significant associations were found between pre-treatment PPT or CPM effects and post-treatment peak pain measures or change in KOOS-4 (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: These results indicate that patients with higher pre-treatment pressure pain sensitivity have worse KOOS4 scores following supervised exercise therapy and education.","Hansen, S.; Bjarke Vaegter, H.; Høgh, M.; Skou, S.

By focusing on the statement, ""We are all disabled"", the book explores the following questions: What are the philosophical, political, and practical implications of making this claim? What conceptions of disability underlie it? When, if ever, is this claim justified, and when or why might it be problematic or harmful? What are the implications of claiming ""we are all disabled"" amidst this global COVID-19 pandemic? These critical reflections on the boundaries of disability include perspectives from the humanities, social sciences, law, and the arts. In exploring the boundaries of disability, and the ways in which these lines are drawn theoretically, legally, medically, socially, and culturally, the authors in this volume challenge particular conceptions of disability, expand the meaning and significance of the term, and consider the implications of claiming disability as an identity. It will be of interest to a broad audience, including disability scholars, advocates and activists, philosophers and historians of disability, moral theorists, clinicians, legal scholars, and artists. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Licia Carlson and Matthew C.

The research endeavor is configured on a two-fold approach, including a detailed observation of the evolution of 274 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (145 in the first wave and 129 in the second wave of infection) according to specific treatment methods applied and patients’ individual features, as well as an econometric (quantitative) analysis through structural equation modeling and Gaussian graphical models designed to acknowledge the correlations and causal relationship between all considered coordinates. The main results highlight that the specific treatment methods applied had a positive influence on the evolution of COVID-19 patients, particularly in the second wave of coronavirus pandemic. In case of the first wave of COVID-19 infection, GGM results entail that there is a strong positive correlation between the evolution of the patients and the COVID-19 disease form, which is further positively correlated with the treatment scheme. The evolution of the patients is strongly and inversely correlated with the symptomatology and the ICU hospitalization. Moreover, the disease form is strongly and inversely correlated with oxygen saturation and the residence of patients (urban/rural). The symptomatology at first appearance also strongly depends on the age of the patients (positive correlation) and of the fact that the patient is a smoker or non-smoker and has other comorbidities. Age and gender are also important credentials that shape the disease degree and patient evolution in responding to treatment as well, our study attesting strong interconnections between these coordinates, the form of disease, symptomatology and overall evolution of the patients.","Mocanu, Alexandra Noja Gratiela Georgiana Istodor Alin Viorel Moise Georgiana Leretter Marius Rusu Laura-Cristina Marza Adina Maria Mederle Alexandru Ovidiu",Journal of Clinical Medicine,548,20

While a previous study demonstrated that health and eHealth literacy are related to COVID-19 prevention behaviors, few studies have focused on the relationship between health literacy, eHealth literacy, and COVID-19-related health behaviors. The latter includes not only preventative behaviors but also conventional health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop and verify a COVID-19-related health behavior questionnaire, explore its status and structure, and examine the associations between these behaviors and participants' health literacy and eHealth literacy. METHODS: A snowball sampling method was adopted to recruit participants to complete anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire surveys online that assessed sociodemographic information, self-reported coronavirus knowledge, health literacy, eHealth literacy, and COVID-19-related health behaviors. RESULTS: Of 1873 college students who were recruited, 781 (41.7%) had adequate health literacy; the mean eHealth literacy score was 30.16 (SD 6.31). The COVID-19-related health behavior questionnaire presented a two-factor structure-COVID-19-specific precautionary behaviors and conventional health behaviors-with satisfactory fit indices and internal consistency (Cronbach &#945;=.79). The mean score of COVID-19-related health behaviors was 53.77 (SD 8.03), and scores differed significantly (P<.05) with respect to residence, college year, academic major, family economic level, self-reported health status, having a family member or friend infected with coronavirus, and health literacy level. Linear regression analysis showed that health literacy and eHealth literacy were positively associated with COVID-19-specific precautionary behaviors (ßhealth literacy=.149, ßeHealth literacy=.368; P<.001) and conventional health behaviors (ßhealth literacy=.219, ßeHealth literacy=.277; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19-related health behavior questionnaire was a valid and reliable measure for assessing health behaviors during the pandemic. College students with higher health literacy and eHealth literacy can more actively adopt COVID-19-related health behaviors. Additionally, compared to health literacy, eHealth literacy is more closely related to COVID-19-related health behaviors. Public intervention measures based on health and eHealth literacy are required to promote COVID-19-related health behaviors during the pandemic, which may be helpful to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection among college students.","Li, Shaojie; Cui, Guanghui; Kaminga, Atipatsa Chiwanda; Cheng, Sixiang; Xu, Huilan",J Med Internet Res,548,16

In an attempt to limit the spread of infection and to preserve healthcare resources, one commonly used strategy has been to postpone elective surgery, whilst maintaining the provision of anaesthetic care for urgent and emergency surgery. General anaesthesia with airway intervention leads to aerosol generation, which increases the risk of COVID-19 contamination in operating rooms and significantly exposes the healthcare teams to COVID-19 infection during both tracheal intubation and extubation. Therefore, the provision of regional anaesthesia may be key during this pandemic, as it may reduce the need for general anaesthesia and the associated risk from aerosol-generating procedures. However, guidelines on the safe performance of regional anaesthesia in light of the COVID-19 pandemic are limited. The goal of this review is to provide up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations or expert opinion when evidence is limited, for performing regional anaesthesia procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. These recommendations focus on seven specific domains including: planning of resources and staffing; modifying the clinical environment; preparing equipment, supplies and drugs; selecting appropriate personal protective equipment; providing adequate oxygen therapy; assessing for and safely performing regional anaesthesia procedures; and monitoring during the conduct of anaesthesia and post-anaesthetic care. Implicit in these recommendations is preserving patient safety whilst protecting healthcare providers from possible exposure.","Uppal, V; Sondekoppam, R V; Landau, R; El-Boghdadly, K; Narouze, S; Kalagara, H K P",Anaesthesia,548,16

It was hypothesized that PROB could potentially affect the disposition of OATP1B drug substrates. The plasma levels of the OATP1B endogenous biomarker candidates, including coproporphyrin I (CPI), CPIII, hexadecanedioate (HDA), and tetradecanedioate (TDA), were examined in 14 healthy subjects treated with PROB. After oral administration with 1,000 mg PROB alone and in combination with furosemide (FSM), AUC(0-24h) values were 1.39 {plus minus} 0.21- and 1.57 {plus minus} 0.41-fold higher than predose levels for CPI and 1.34 {plus minus} 0.16- and 1.45 {plus minus} 0.57-fold higher for CPIII. Despite increased systemic exposures, no decreases in CPI and CPIII renal clearance (CLR) were observed (0.97 {plus minus} 0.38- and 1.16 {plus minus} 0.51-fold for CPI, and 1.34 {plus minus} 0.53- and 1.50 {plus minus} 0.69-fold for CPIII, respectively). These results suggest that the increase of CP systemic exposure is caused by OATP1B inhibition. Consistent with this hypothesis, PROB inhibited OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport of CPI in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 167 and 76.0 µM, respectively, in transporter overexpressing cell assay. The inhibition potential was further confirmed by CPI and CPIII hepatocyte uptake experiments. Taken together, these findings indicate that PROB displays weak OATP1B inhibitory effects in vivo and CP is a sensitive endogenous probe of OATP1B inhibition. This study provides an explanation for the heretofore unknown mechanism responsible for PROB's interactions. Significance Statement This study suggested that PROB is a weak clinical inhibitor of OATP1B based on the totality of evidence from the clinical interaction between PROB and CP, and the in vitro inhibitory effect of PROB on OATP1B-mediated CP uptake. It demonstrates a new methodology of utilizing endogenous biomarkers to evaluate complex DDI, providing explanation for the heretofore unknown mechanism responsible for PROB's inhibition. It provides evidence to strengthen the claim that CP is a sensitive circulating endogenous biomarker of OATP1B inhibition.","Zhang, Yueping; Holenarsipur, Vinay K; Kandoussi, Hamza; Zeng, Jianing; Mariappan, T Thanga; Sinz, Michael; Shen, Hong",Drug metab. dispos,548,16

The spike (S) glycoprotein binds ACE2 and promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. The trimeric S protein binds the receptor using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) causing conformational changes in S protein that allow priming by host cell proteases. Unraveling the dynamic structural features used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal novel therapeutic targets. Using structures determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, we performed structural analysis and atomic comparisons of the different conformational states adopted by the SARS-CoV-2-RBD. RESULTS: Here, we determined the key structural components induced by the receptor and characterized their intramolecular interactions. We show that &#954;-helix (polyproline-II) is a predominant structure in the binding interface and in facilitating the conversion to the active form of the S protein. We demonstrate a series of conversions between switch-like &#954;-helix and ß-strand, and conformational variations in a set of short &#945;-helices which affect the hinge region. These conformational changes lead to an alternating pattern in conserved disulfide bond configurations positioned at the hinge, indicating a possible disulfide exchange, an important allosteric switch implicated in viral entry of various viruses, including HIV and murine coronavirus. The structural information presented herein enables to inspect and understand the important dynamic features of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and propose a novel potential therapeutic strategy to block viral entry. Overall, this study provides guidance for the design and optimization of structure-based intervention strategies that target SARS-CoV-2.

The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature. Two similar human coronaviruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) are known to cause disease in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 has neurologic consequences as well. Observations: This review serves to summarize available information regarding coronaviruses in the nervous system, identify the potential tissue targets and routes of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, and describe the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19 and their potential pathogenesis. Viral neuroinvasion may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. The most common neurologic complaints in COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but other diseases, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizure, and encephalopathy, have also been reported. Conclusions and Relevance: Recognition and understanding of the range of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to improved clinical outcomes and better treatment algorithms. Further neuropathological studies will be crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease in the central nervous system, and longitudinal neurologic and cognitive assessment of individuals after recovery from COVID-19 will be crucial to understand the natural history of COVID-19 in the central nervous system and monitor for any long-term neurologic sequelae.","Zubair, Adeel S; McAlpine, Lindsay S; Gardin, Tova; Farhadian, Shelli; Kuruvilla, Deena E; Spudich, Serena",JAMA Neurol,548,3

The government rapidly initiated a public health response and provided adequate medical care to manage the public health crisis during the implementation of movement restrictions, starting 18th March 2020, throughout the country. The objective of this study was to investigate the relative efficiency level of managing COVID-19 in Malaysia using network data envelopment analysis. Malaysia state-level data were extracted from secondary data sources which include variables such as total number of confirmed cases, death cases and recovered cases. These variables were used as inputs and outputs in a network process that consists of 3 sub processes i) community surveillance, ii) medical care I and iii) medical care II. A state-level analysis was performed according to low, medium and high population density categories. The efficiency level of community surveillance was highest compared to medical care processes, indicating that the overall inefficiency is greatly influenced by the inefficiency of the medical care processes rather than the community surveillance process. Results showed that high-density category performed well in both community surveillance and medical care II processes. Meanwhile, low-density category performed better in medical care I process. There was a good overall performance of the health system in Malaysia reflecting a strong preparedness and response level to this pandemic.

Rapid management and transfer],17.178297,-0.6804545,2020,"The majority of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in use or advanced development are based on the viral spike protein (S) as their immunogen. S is present on virions as pre-fusion trimers in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) is stochastically open or closed. Neutralizing antibodies have been described against both open and closed conformations. The long-term success of vaccination strategies depends upon inducing antibodies that provide long-lasting broad immunity against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains. Here we have assessed the results of immunization in a mouse model using an S protein trimer stabilized in the closed state to prevent full exposure of the receptor binding site and therefore interaction with receptor. We compared this with other modified S protein constructs, including representatives used in current vaccines. We found that all trimeric S proteins induced a T cell response and long-lived, strongly neutralizing antibody responses against 2019 SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern B.1.248 and B.1.351. Notably, the protein binding properties of sera induced by the closed spike differed from those induced by standard S protein constructs. Closed S proteins induced more potent neutralizing responses than expected based on the degree to which they inhibit interactions between the RBD and ACE2. These observations suggest that closed spikes recruit different, but equally potent, immune responses than open spikes, and that this is likely to include neutralizing antibodies against conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. Together with their improved stability and storage properties we suggest that closed spikes may be a valuable component of refined, next-generation vaccines.ImportanceVaccines in use against SARS-CoV-2 induce immune responses against the spike protein. There is intense interest in whether the antibody response induced by vaccines will be robust against new variants, as well as in next-generation vaccines for use in previously infected or immunized individuals. We assessed the use as an immunogen of a spike protein engineered to be conformationally stabilized in the closed state where the receptor binding site is occluded. Despite occlusion of the receptor binding site, the spike induces potently neutralizing sera against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. Antibodies are raised against a different pattern of epitopes to those induced by other spike constructs, preferring conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. Closed spikes, or mRNA vaccines based on their sequence, can be a valuable component of next generation vaccines.","Carnell, George W; Ciazynska, Katarzyna A; Wells, David A; Xiong, Xiaoli; Aguinam, Ernest T; McLaughlin, Stephen H; Mallery, Donna; Ebrahimi, Soraya; Ceron-Gutierrez, Lourdes; Asbach, Benedikt; Einhauser, Sebastian; Wagner, Ralf; James, Leo C; Doffinger, Rainer; Heeney, Jonathan L; Briggs, John A G",J. virol,548,15

As public health messaging plays a pivotal role in the provision of directives during a health crisis, this study examines Canadians' opinions on the early messaging they received regarding personal protection, especially around mask use, with the goal of identifying potential improvements to strengthen future health messaging. Nine online focus group interviews with 47 Canadians were conducted. These natural conversations focused on personal protective equipment (PPE) choices, mask-relevant public health information sources, and advice to Canadian authorities to improve public health messaging on mask use. Responses were imported into NVivo for thematic analysis. Four meta-themes of relevance were identified. Despite demonstrating trust in scientific evidence and public health authorities, the inconsistencies in public health messaging fostered confusion, and induced mistrust toward health professionals. Further, several information deficits were identified pertaining to the scientific efficacy, safe use, and disposal of masks. Rooted in loyalty to healthcare workers, these Canadians eschewed using medical grade masks during PPE shortages to ensure a sufficient supply for medical workers. The findings stress that consistency in public health messages should be prioritized, with necessary changes clearly justified and explained. More information should reach the public on the scientific benefits and proper use of masks. Public health recommendations should be evidence-based, simple, transparent, and realistic in the current circumstances to guide Canadians to make more informed personal protection choices in the rapidly evolving pandemic.","Zhang, Ying Shan Doris; Young Leslie, Heather; Sharafaddin-Zadeh, Yekta; Noels, Kimberly; Lou, Nigel Mantou",J. community health,548,23

With little knowledge of COVID-19 virus, very few published reports on surgical outcomes; hospitals stopped elective surgery, whilst emergency surgery was offered only after exhausting all conservative treatment modalities. This study presents our experience of outcomes of emergency appendectomies performed during the pandemic. Methods - Prospectively we collected data on 132 patients in peak pandemic period from 1st March to 5th June 2020 and data compared with 206 patients operated in similar period in 2019. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, pre-operative events, investigations, surgical management, postoperative outcomes and complications were analysed. Results - Demographics and ASA grades of both cohorts were comparable. In study cohort 84.4% and 96.7% in control cohort had laparoscopic appendicectomy. Whilst the study cohort had 13.6% primary open operations, control cohort had 5.3%. Mean length of stay and early post-operative complications (&lt;30 days) were similar in both cohorts apart from surgical site infections (p = 0.02) and one mortality in study cohort. Conclusion - In these overwhelming pandemic times, although conservative treatment of acute appendicitis is an option, a proportion of patients will need surgery. Our study shows that with careful planning and strict theatre protocols, emergency appendicectomy can be safely offered with minimal risk of spreading COVID-19 infection. These observations warrant further prospective randomised studies.

Despite this, the literature around PPI in health services and research originating from European countries appears less than from the United Kingdom (UK), where PPI is well established. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to explore the attitudes and approaches to PPI across Europe. Eight scientific databases were systematically searched and data extracted. Data quality was assessed using a checklist based on the Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP2) (Staniszewska et al., Research, Involvement and Engagement, 3, 13, 2017) and the critical appraisal guidelines developed by Wright et al. (Health Expectations, 13, 359, 2010). We included all studies reporting PPI activity in both public and private health services and research institutions in the World Health Organization European region, excluding the UK, published in the English language from 1996 to 2018. Forty studies in total were included in the analysis. The studies imply a growing interest and support for the idea of PPI in health services and, to a lesser extent, in health research. There seems to be a convergence of conceptualisations of PPI across Europe, with internationally significant areas of innovative work taking place in countries such as the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries. However, the implementation of PPI is highly uneven, and PPI is not yet firmly embedded or adequately formalised in European healthcare systems and research, possibly due to a lack of infrastructure, guidance and support. In order to try to get a better understanding of what is happening on the ground, we are carrying out a survey with potential follow-up interviews as the next part of this research project.

We systematically searched Medline, Embase and Cochrane for studies published between January 2000 and September 2020. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they included a portable, commercially available air filter in any indoor setting including care homes, schools or healthcare settings, investigating either associations with incidence of respiratory infections or removal and/or capture of aerosolised bacteria and viruses from the air within the filters. Dual data screening and extraction with narrative synthesis. No studies were found investigating the effects of air filters on the incidence of respiratory infections. Two studies investigated bacterial capture within filters and bacterial load in indoor air. One reported higher numbers of viable bacteria in the HEPA filter than in floor dust samples. The other reported HEPA filtration combined with ultraviolet light reduced bacterial load in the air by 41% (sampling time not reported). Neither paper investigated effects on viruses. There is an important absence of evidence regarding the effectiveness of a potentially cost-efficient intervention for indoor transmission of respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Two studies provide 'proof of principle' that air filters can capture airborne bacteria in an indoor setting. Randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to investigate effects of portable HEPA filters on incidence of respiratory infections.","Hammond, Ashley; Khalid, Tanzeela; Thornton, Hannah V; Woodall, Claire A; Hay, Alastair D",PLoS One,548,24

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) formulated and established laboratory surveillance for COVID-19. In this study, an analysis of the surveillance data was done to describe the testing performance and descriptive epidemiology of COVID-19 cases by time, place and person. Methods: The data were extracted from January 22 to April 30, 2020. The frequencies of testing performance were described over time and by place. We described cases by time (epidemic curve by date of specimen collection; seven-day moving average), place (area map) and person (attack rate by age, sex and contact status), and trends were represented along with public health measures and events. Results: Between January 22 and April 30, 2020, a total of 1,021,518 individuals were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Testing increased from about 250 individuals per day in the beginning of March to 50,000 specimens per day by the end of April 2020. Overall, 40,184 (3.9%) tests were reported positive. The proportion of positive cases was highest among symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts, 2-3-fold higher than among those with severe acute respiratory infection, or those with an international travel history or healthcare workers. The attack rate (per million) by age was highest among those aged 50-69 yr (63.3) and was lowest among those under 10 yr (6.1). The attack rate was higher among males (41.6) than females (24.3). The secondary attack rate was 6.0 per cent. Overall, 99.0 per cent of 736 districts reported testing and 71.1 per cent reported COVID-19 cases. Interpretation & conclusions: The coverage and frequency of ICMR's laboratory surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 improved over time.

This troubles mental health, but also mental health care as treatments usually take place in personal contact and switching to remote treatments might be necessary in times of COVID-19. The present study investigated the question how the provision of psychotherapy changed in the early weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and whether there were differences between the four therapeutic orientations eligible in Austria (psychodynamic, humanistic, systemic, behavioral). Psychotherapists (N = 1547) completed an online survey. They entered their number of patients treated on average per week (in personal contact, via telephone, via Internet) in the early weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria as well as (retrospectively) in the months before. The number of patients treated on average per week in personal contact decreased (on average 81%;p < 0.001), whereas the number of patients treated on average per week via telephone and via Internet increased (on average 979% and 1561%;both p < 0.001). Yet, the decrease of psychotherapies through personal contact was not compensated for by increases of remote psychotherapies (p < 0.001). No diFFerences between the four therapeutic orientations emerged. Results imply an undersupply of psychotherapy in the COVID-19 lockdown and that further changes are necessary to cover the increased need for timely psychotherapy in times of COVID-19.","Probst, T.; Stippl, P.; Pieh, C.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,548,15

During the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, medical professionals need to strike a balance between providing timely treatment for STEMI patients and implementing infection control procedures to prevent nosocomial spread of COVID-19 among health care workers and other vulnerable cardiovascular patients. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and China Chest Pain Center's modified STEMI protocol on the treatment and prognosis of STEMI patients in China. METHODS: Based on the data of 28,189 STEMI patients admitted to 1,372 Chest Pain Centers in China between December 27, 2019 and February 20, 2020, the study analyzed how the COVID-19 outbreak and China Chest Pain Center's modified STEMI protocol influenced the number of admitted STEMI cases, reperfusion strategy, key treatment time points, and in-hospital mortality and heart failure for STEMI patients. RESULTS: The COVID-19 outbreak reduced the number of STEMI cases reported to China Chest Pain Centers. Consistent with China Chest Pain Center's modified STEMI protocol, the percentage of patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention declined while the percentage of patients undergoing thrombolysis increased. With an average delay of approximately 20 min for reperfusion therapy, the rate of in-hospital mortality and in-hospital heart failure increased during the outbreak, but the rate of in-hospital hemorrhage remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: There were reductions in STEMI patients' access to care, delays in treatment timelines, changes in reperfusion strategies, and an increase of in-hospital mortality and heart failure during the COVID-19 pandemic in China.","Xiang, Dingcheng; Xiang, Xin; Zhang, Wei; Yi, Shaodong; Zhang, Jinxia; Gu, Xiaolong; Xu, Yawei; Huang, Kai; Su, Xi; Yu, Bo; Wang, Yan; Fang, Weiyi; Huo, Yong; Ge, Junbo",J Am Coll Cardiol,548,16

In recent years new kinds of devices have emerged which can be used subcutaneously or worn on the skin. In particular for large-scale arrhythmia monitoring, small, unobtrusive gadgets seem positioned to upend paradigms and care delivery. However, the performance of CIEDs and wearables is only as good as their sensing and detection capacities. Whether for pacing, defibrillation or diagnostic monitoring, the device must be able to process and filter the sensed signal to reduce noise and to exclude irrelevant physiological signals. The demands on sensing and detection quality will differ depending on how the information is applied. With a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter/defibrillator, withheld or erroneous therapy can have severe consequences and accurate and reliable detection of cardiac function is crucial. Monitoring devices are usually used in risk assessment and management, with greater tolerance for isolated artefacts or lower quality of readings.

However, there is uncertainty about what the ""new normal"" in mental health care will be like in post-COVID-19 times. To what extent will the experiences gained during the pandemic influence a sustainable adoption and implementation of online mental health care treatment in the future? OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we aim to formulate expectations with regard to the sustainability of online mental health care after COVID-19. METHODS: In an interview study, 11 mental health care professionals were asked about their experiences and expectations for the future. Participants were recruited from a mental health care organization in the Netherlands. The interviews took place between April 7-30, 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in the Netherlands. The data were analyzed using a thematic coding method. RESULTS: From the interviews, we learn that the new normal in mental health care will most likely consist of more blended treatments. Due to skill enhancement and (unexpected) positive experiences with online treatment, an increase in adoption is likely to take place. However, not all experiences promise a successful and sustainable upscaling of online treatment in the future. Mental health care professionals are learning that not all clients are able to benefit from this type of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Sustainable upscaling of online mental health care requires customized solutions, investments in technology, and flexibility of mental health care providers. Online treatment could work for those who are open to it, but many factors influence whether it will work in specific situations. There is work to be done before online treatment is inherently part of mental health care.","Bierbooms, Joyce J P A; van Haaren, Monique; IJsselsteijn, Wijnand A; de Kort, Yvonne A W; Feijt, Milou; Bongers, Inge M B",JMIR Form Res,548,16

It observes combinations between language, technology and information in social information practices and activities during the Covid-19 pandemic. Theoretical-conceptual framework analyzes the social uses of ICT from the perspective of the French school: the strong relationship between the human condition of existence and processes of control of communication, use of language and fake news mediated by the intensive use of ICT. It delimits two contexts for analysis: the organizational spaces of Brazilian federal public universities dealing with the coevolution between public policies, institutions and technological development;and experiences in the use of technologies by social minorities with less access to information. In both, the technologies provide new resources for producing opportunities to improve previously established limits. Methodological procedures: uses systematic bibliographic research in the field of Communication and Information Science to discuss the concepts of social use of ICT with an emphasis on the French school and the challenges, in the scenario of the Covid-19 pandemic, about the social uses of ICT in social interest organizations and minority groups with little access to information. Results: expects the recognition of mutual influence in order to reformulate, in the terms of Gonzalez de Gomez (2004), the alliances between subjects (groups and organizations), information and means (technologies). Partial considerations: Organizations and social groups constitute a chain of relationships and interrelations in the social fabric regulated by development models derived from social, economic and political processes defining plural relationships: intermediate (mediated by new and old technologies), interorganizational (universities, associations, companies, institutions) and intersocial (social groups as collective subjects, collectives of professionals, etc.).","do Nascimento, Ladl Jantorno E.; da Fonseca, M.

From 1 April 2020 until 31 July 2020 a database was used to prospectively collect records for all patients with CFI who presented to oral and maxillofacial teams. Information gathered included clinical presentation, location/origin of infection, and how this was managed. The OMFS units were asked to compare the patient's care with the treatment that would usually have been given prior to the crisis. A total of 32 OMFS units recorded 1381 cases of CFI in the UK. Most of the infections were referred via the emergency department (74%). Lower first or second molars were the most common origin, contributing 40% of CFI. Collaborators reported that patients' treatments were modified as a response to COVID in 20% of cases, the most frequently cited reason being the application of COVID-19 hospital policy (85%). The impact of the first wave of COVID modified the management of a significant number of patients presenting with CFI, and there was a proactive move to avoid general anaesthetics where possible. Some patients who presented to secondary care were given no treatment, suggesting they could have been managed in primary dental care if this had been available. We recommend that OMFS units and urgent dental care centres (UDCCs) build strong communication links not only to provide the best possible patient care, but to minimise COVID exposure and the strain on emergency departments during the pandemic.","Puglia, F A; Ubhi, H; Dawoud, B; Magennis, P; Chiu, G A",Br. j. oral maxillofac. surg,548,24

It started in China in December 2019, and it rapidly spread throughout Italy, which has been the most affected country after China. The pandemia touched all countries with similarly negative effects on population, countries and healthcare structures. OBJECTIVE: Evolution of the Covid-19 infection as well as the way such a phenomena can be characterized in terms of resources and planning, has to be considered. One of the most critical resource items has been the less of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) places with respect to the infection trend and critical hospitalization. METHODS: We propose a model to estimate the needed number of places in ICUs during the most acute phase of the infection. We also define a scalable geographic model to plan emergency and future Covid-19 patients management by planning their reallocation in health structures of other region. RESULTS: We apply and assess the prediction method both at national and regional scale. ICU beds prediction has been tested with respect to real data provided by the Italian gouvernement. We show that our model is able to predict with a reliable error in terms of complexity of resources related to estimation parameters used for healthcare structures. Also, the proposed method is scalable at geographic level. This is relevant for pandemic phenomena as Covid-19 that have shown their different incidence even among northern and southern Italian regions. CONCLUSIONS: The contribution can be useful for decision-makers to plan resources to guarantee patients management, but it can be considered a reference model for the potential upcoming and feared virus increasing phase as well as for similar coronavirus diffusion.","Guzzi, Pietro H; Tradigo, Giuseppe; Veltri, Pierangelo",,548,26

The food and beverage industries have been profoundly affected, from production, to modifications in consumers' choices. Among the different reasons behind those modifications is confinement, which forces consumers to stay at home for an extended period and just go out to perform essential tasks, such as going to the supermarket. We hypothesized that this new dynamic of consumption could create a situation of fear that changes food choice. To test this hypothesis, two studies were conducted in three countries with a different degree of confinement: Mexico (flexible), Spain (strict), and Peru (hard). Study one consisted of a free association task with 60 participants in each country with the inductor word ""coronavirus and food"". The different associations served as the basis to build a structured questionnaire, which was used in the second study focused on fear and food choice. The second study was applied to 450 participants in the same three countries. Results showed that fear can be separated into nine dimensions: social, emotional, food supply, government, basic needs, food-delivery, overeating, immunity, and family conflicts. The participants could also be clustered into four different groups that differ in their country of origin and sex, but also in their food choice. Overall, the results showed that fear influenced consumer's food choices during a confinement period.","Gomez-Corona, C.; Rakotosamimanana, V. R.; Saenz-Navajas, M.

449644,449644,449644,Coronavirus: una amplia familia de virus no tan nueva,16.89284,-0.62704605,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although the COVID-19 pandemic will have a negative effect on China's economy in the short term, it also represents a major opportunity for internet-based medical treatment in the medium and long term. Compared with normal times, internet-based medical platforms including the Haodf website were visited by 1.11 billion people, the number of new registered users of all platforms increased by 10, and the number of new users' daily consultations increased by 9 during the pandemic. The continuous participation of physicians is a major factor in the success of the platform, and economic return is an important reason for physicians to provide internet-based services. However, no study has provided the effectiveness of interactive tools in online health care communities to influence physicians' returns. OBJECTIVE: The effect of internet-based effort on the benefits and effectiveness of interactive effort tools in internet-based health care areas remains unclear. Thus, the goals of this study are to examine the effect of doctors' internet-based service quality on their economic returns during COVID-19 social restrictions, to examine the effect of mutual help groups on doctors' economic returns during COVID-19 social restrictions, and to explore the moderating effect of disease privacy on doctors' efforts and economic returns during COVID-19 social restrictions. METHODS: On the basis of the social exchange theory, this study establishes an internet-based effort exchange model for doctors. We used a crawler to download information automatically from Haodf website. From March 5 to 7, 2020, which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, cross-sectional information of 2530 doctors were collected. RESULTS: Hierarchical linear regression showed that disease privacy (ß=.481; P<.001), reputation (ß=.584; P<.001), and service quality (ß=.560; P<.001) had a significant positive effect on the economic returns of the physicians. The influence of mutual help groups on earnings increases with an increase in the degree of disease privacy (ß=.189; P<.001), indicating that mutual help groups have a stronger effect on earnings when patients ask questions about diseases regarding which they desire privacy. CONCLUSIONS: For platform operators, the results of this study can help the platform understand how to improve doctors' economic returns, especially regarding helping a specific doctor group improve its income to retain good doctors. For physicians on the platform, this study will help doctors spend their limited energy and time on tools that can improve internet-based consultation incomes. Patients who receive internet-based health care services extract information about a doctor based on the doctor's internet-based efforts to understand the doctor's level of professionalism and personality to choose the doctor they like the most. The data used in this study may be biased or not representative of all medical platforms, as they were collected from a single website.","Ren, Dixuan; Ma, Baolong",J Med Internet Res,548,16

This article presents a model of cyberchondria during public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The factors that contribute to cyberchondria at this time include (a) a heightened perception of threat and fear of a newly identified and poorly understood disease; (b) difficulty in coping with uncertainty associated with the pandemic; (c) lack of authoritative and trustworthy sources of relevant health information; (d) difficulty in coping with abundance of information that is often confusing, conflicting, unverified and constantly updated, along with a decreased ability to filter out unnecessary information; and (e) inability of excessive online health information seeking to provide the necessary information and deliver reassurance. These factors amplify fear and distress, which increases the perception of threat and uncertainty and perpetuates further online health searches. Cyberchondria has significant public health implications because of the associated distress or functional impairment and effects on health behaviors. Cyberchondria should be addressed by targeting a heightened perception of threat, improving management of uncertainty and online health information and promoting an ability to critically appraise the results of online health searches. This should contribute to a better online health information literacy. The model of cyberchondria during the COVID-19 pandemic explains the hypothesized rise in cyberchondria during public health emergencies and helps to formulate a framework for prevention of cyberchondria and its effective management.","Starcevic, Vladan; Schimmenti, Adriano; Billieux, Joël; Berle, David",,548,16

To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated whether aspirin use is associated with reduced risk of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to multiple hospitals in the United States between March 2020 and July 2020 was performed. The primary outcome was the need for mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios for study outcomes were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models after adjustment for the effects of demographics and co-morbid conditions. RESULTS: Four hundred twelve patients were included in the study. Three hundred fourteen patients (76.3%) did not receive aspirin, while 98 patients (23.7%) received aspirin within 24 hours of admission or 7 days prior to admission. Aspirin use had a crude association with less mechanical ventilation (35.7% aspirin vs. 48.4% non-aspirin, p=0.03) and ICU admission (38.8% aspirin vs. 51.0% non-aspirin, p=0.04), but no crude association with in-hospital mortality (26.5% aspirin vs. 23.2% non-aspirin, p=0.51). After adjusting for 8 confounding variables, aspirin use was independently associated with decreased risk of mechanical ventilation (adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.85, p=0.007), ICU admission (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38-0.85, p=0.005), and in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31-0.90, p=0.02).

To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated whether aspirin use is associated with reduced risk of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to multiple hospitals in the United States between March 2020 and July 2020 was performed. The primary outcome was the need for mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios for study outcomes were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models after adjustment for the effects of demographics and co-morbid conditions. RESULTS: Four hundred twelve patients were included in the study. Three hundred fourteen patients (76.3%) did not receive aspirin, while 98 patients (23.7%) received aspirin within 24 hours of admission or 7 days prior to admission. Aspirin use had a crude association with less mechanical ventilation (35.7% aspirin vs. 48.4% non-aspirin, p=0.03) and ICU admission (38.8% aspirin vs. 51.0% non-aspirin, p=0.04), but no crude association with in-hospital mortality (26.5% aspirin vs. 23.2% non-aspirin, p=0.51). After adjusting for 8 confounding variables, aspirin use was independently associated with decreased risk of mechanical ventilation (adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.85, p=0.007), ICU admission (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38-0.85, p=0.005), and in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31-0.90, p=0.02).

The objectives of this study are to determine the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in pediatric subjects with COVID-19, evaluate patient characteristics, and describe treatments applied. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using TriNetX electronic health record data of subjects aged <18 years who were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, code U07.1). Pulmonary embolism was identified by using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, code I26. We additionally collected data on age, sex, race, ethnicity, all diagnostic codes, medications, procedures, laboratory results, comorbidities, and outcomes. RESULTS: During the study period, 24 723 pediatric subjects were reported to have a COVID-19 infection diagnosis among 41 health care organizations, of which 693 (2.8%) were hospitalized. Eight subjects (0.03% overall and 1.2% of hospitalized patients) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. The median age (25th to 75th percentile) of patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism was 16.5 years, and median (25th to 75th percentile) BMI was 22.1 (19.6-47.9). Three (37.5%) received critical care services, and 1 (12.5%) underwent mechanical ventilation. Five (62.5%) subjects had potentially significant risk factors (obesity, malignancy, recent surgery, and oral contraceptive use). All patients received anticoagulation, but none underwent thrombolysis. There were no reported deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Although pulmonary embolism is diagnosed less commonly in children than in adults, its occurrence appears to be more frequent in children hospitalized with COVID-19, as compared with previous reports in hospitalized children in general. All patients survived, with only 1 requiring mechanical ventilation.","Chima, Melissa; Williams, Duane; Thomas, Neal J; Krawiec, Conrad",Hosp Pediatr,548,4

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study audited the performance of a tertiary care surgical oncology department at an academic hospital in India during the first six months of the pandemic. Difficulties faced by patients, COVID-19-related incidents (preventable cases of hospital transmission), and modifications in practice were recorded. RESULTS: From April to September 2020, outpatient consultations, inpatient admissions, and chemotherapy unit functioning reduced by 62%, 58%, and 56%, respectively, compared to the same period the previous year. Major surgeries dropped by 31% with a decrease across all sites, but an increase in head and neck cancers (p = .012, absolute difference 8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.75% - 14.12%). Postoperative complications were similar (p = .593, 95% CI: -2.61% - 4.87%). Inability to keep a surgical appointment was primarily due to apprehension of infection (52%) or arranging finances (49%). Two COVID-19-related incidents resulted in infecting 27 persons. Fifteen instances of possible COVID-19-related mishaps were averted. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a decrease in the operations of the department without any adverse impact in postoperative outcomes. While challenging, treating cancer adequately during COVID-19 can be accomplished by adequate screening and testing, and religiously following the prevention guidelines.","Akhtar, Naseem; Rajan, Shiv; Chakrabarti, Deep; Kumar, Vijay; Gupta, Sameer; Misra, Sanjeev; Chaturvedi, Arun; Azhar, Tashbihul; Parveen, Shirin; Qayoom, Sumaira; Niranjan, Palavalasa; Tiwari, Shashwat",J Surg Oncol,548,16

The antiviral efficacy of Resveratrol was demonstrated for several viruses, including coronavirus. Resveratrol was shown to mitigate the major pathways involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, including regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), stimulation of immune system and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines release. It was also reported to promote SIRT1 and p53 signaling pathways and increase cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) immune cells. In addition, Resveratrol was demonstrated to be a stimulator of fetal hemoglobin and a potent antioxidant, by trapping reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Since that time there has been rapid spread and considerable mortality and morbidity. The immunology of COVID-19 is still being determined in the general population as well as select groups such as pregnant females whose immune response may be altered. Here we present a case of questionable relapse vs reinfection of COVID-19 in a pregnant health care worker. Case description A 32 year old female healthcare worker, with no significant past medical history developed slight shortness of breath and loss of taste and smell soon after she discovered about her first pregnancy. She subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 in April 2020. At that time she was at six weeks gestation. She never developed a fever, cough, GI symptoms, malaise, muscle fatigue or sore throat. Because her symptoms were mild and stable, and she never required oxygen supplements, she was asked to quarantine at home, and to take the needed precautions. Telephone visits have been conducted daily to check on her clinical status and patient had access to pulse oximetry and thermostat and therefore has been keeping track of her vital signs and wellbeing. In May 2020 - one month after initial infection- she reported total clearance of her initial symptoms and she has been preparing to return to work. She however reported that she has had contact COVID-19 positive individuals. Because of that she has been retested prior to returning to work. Nasopharyngeal swab was performed and PCR was negative. Two weeks later, she reported acute onset on dyspnea on exertion, and loss of taste and smell. Nasopharyngeal swab was performed and PCR was positive. She experienced mild symptoms and was quarantined home. One month later, she reported resolution of symptoms and repeat COVID19 testing was negative. Discussion Studies have shown that post infection immunity has conferred for at least 3-6 month. Clinical course and prognosis of COVID19 in pregnancy has been found to be associated with more complications and rapid clinical deterioration. Hence, frequent ICU admissions and need for mechanical ventilation were noticed in pregnant COVID19 infected females, however, limited data is available on post infection immunity in pregnancy. Hence, it remains unknown if this presented patient has experienced relapse of an initial infection or if given her immunosuppressed state in setting of pregnancy she has re-acquired the infection.","Abuhalimeh, B.

The impact of such stressors on disease activity in individuals with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is unclear. The aim of this study is to examine whether stress, anxiety, and depression are associated with patient-reported disease activity, after accounting for important factors. METHODS: We administered a survey to an axSpA cohort from a single center with well-defined demographic and disease characteristics. We included questions about job status changes, exercise, medication use, disease activity (by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index [BASDAI]), and psychological factors (stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety). Separate multivariable linear models examined the associations between perceived stress, anxiety, and depression with the BASDAI. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, those with higher levels of stress had a statistically significant 0.54-point higher BASDAI, on average, compared with those with lower levels of stress (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11, 0.97). Those with higher levels of anxiety also had a statistically significant higher BASDAI, on average, compared with those with lower levels of anxiety (ß: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.99). The association between depression and BASDAI was not statistically significant. We did not find differences in these associations among subgroups of age, job status, or county of residence. CONCLUSION: Individuals with axSpA with higher levels of stress and anxiety had significantly higher disease activity levels, although with a difference below clinical importance. Further planned studies will evaluate the trajectory of disease activity.","Liew, Jean W; Castillo, Maria; Zaccagnino, Ethan; Katz, Patricia; Haroon, Nigil; Gensler, Lianne S",ACR Open Rheumatol,548,15

We estimated the long-term clinical impact of breast and colorectal cancer screening interruptions in Canada using a validated mathematical model. METHODS: We used the OncoSim breast and colorectal cancers microsimulation models to explore scenarios of primary screening stops for 3, 6, and 12 months followed by 6-24-month transition periods of reduced screening volumes. For breast cancer, we estimated changes in cancer incidence over time, additional advanced-stage cases diagnosed, and excess cancer deaths in 2020-2029. For colorectal cancer, we estimated changes in cancer incidence over time, undiagnosed advanced adenomas and colorectal cancers in 2020, and lifetime excess cancer incidence and deaths. RESULTS: Our simulations projected a surge of cancer cases when screening resumes. For breast cancer screening, a three-month interruption could increase cases diagnosed at advanced stages (310 more) and cancer deaths (110 more) in 2020-2029. A six-month interruption could lead to 670 extra advanced cancers and 250 additional cancer deaths. For colorectal cancers, a six-month suspension of primary screening could increase cancer incidence by 2200 cases with 960 more cancer deaths over the lifetime. Longer interruptions, and reduced volumes when screening resumes, would further increase excess cancer deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Interruptions in cancer screening will lead to additional cancer deaths, additional advanced cancers diagnosed, and a surge in demand for downstream resources when screening resumes. An effective strategy is needed to minimize potential harm to people who missed their screening.","Yong, Jean He; Mainprize, James G; Yaffe, Martin J; Ruan, Yibing; Poirier, Abbey E; Coldman, Andrew; Nadeau, Claude; Iragorri, Nicolas; Hilsden, Robert J; Brenner, Darren R",J Med Screen,548,23

The purpose of this review is to provide important updates on cytokines and inflammatory mediators related to myositis. RECENT FINDINGS: In the past 5 years, multiple studies brought a fresh insight into the pathogenesis of myositis by introducing new factors or further characterizing the role of the well established mediators in myositis. Among the mediators reviewed in this article, special attention was paid to interferons, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, interleukin-18 and the IL23/Th17 axis. Some of the recent work has also focused on the nontraditional cytokines, such as adipokines, myokines, S100 proteins, High Mobility Group Box 1 or B-cell activating factor and on several anti-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, microRNAs and their potential to reflect the disease activity or to regulate the inflammatory processes in myositis have recently been subject of intensive investigation. Some of the above-mentioned mediators have been proposed as promising clinical biomarkers or therapeutic targets for myositis. SUMMARY: Several recent studies contributed to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of myositis and highlighted the clinical significance of certain inflammatory mediators. Application of these new findings may help to develop innovative approaches for patients' phenotyping, disease activity monitoring and potentially novel therapies.","Cerezo, Lucie Andrés; Vencovský, Jirí; Senolt, Ladislav",Curr Opin Rheumatol,548,1

Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time-series models were used to evaluate if the observed winter 2019/2020 rates were higher than the forecast 95% prediction intervals. The estimated excess number of visits and hospitalizations in winter 2019/2020 were calculated compared to previous seasons. RESULTS: The percentage of patients presenting with an EHR reason for visit containing the word ""cough"" to clinics exceeded the 95% prediction interval the week of December 22, 2019, and was consistently above the 95% prediction interval all 10 weeks through the end of February 2020. Similar trends were noted for emergency department visits and hospitalizations starting December 22, 2019, where observed data exceeded the 95% prediction interval in 6 and 7 of the 10 weeks, respectively. The estimated excess over the 3-month 2019/2020 winter season, obtained by either subtracting the maximum or subtracting the average of the five previous seasons from the current season, was 1.6 or 2.0 excess visits for cough per 1000 outpatient visits, 11.0 or 19.2 excess visits for cough per 1000 emergency department visits, and 21.4 or 39.1 excess visits per 1000 hospitalizations with acute respiratory failure, respectively. The total numbers of excess cases above the 95% predicted forecast interval were 168 cases in the outpatient clinics, 56 cases for the emergency department, and 18 hospitalized with acute respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly higher number of patients with respiratory complaints and diseases starting in late December 2019 and continuing through February 2020 suggests community spread of SARS-CoV-2 prior to established clinical awareness and testing capabilities. This provides a case example of how health system analytics combined with EHR data can provide powerful and agile tools for identifying when future trends in patient populations are outside of the expected ranges.","Elmore, Joann G; Wang, Pin-Chieh; Kerr, Kathleen F; Schriger, David L; Morrison, Douglas E; Brookmeyer, Ron; Pfeffer, Michael A; Payne, Thomas H; Currier, Judith S",J Med Internet Res,548,24

We aimed to estimate in near real time the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this modelling study, we developed a method to reconstruct the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of infections being detected, using the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence, hospitalisation, and case data, with deconvolution methods. We developed our method on a dataset consisting of seroprevalence estimates from 9782 participants (aged &#8805;20 years) in the two worst affected regions of France in May, 2020, and applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions over the period March, 2020, to January, 2021. We validated our method externally using data from a national seroprevalence study done between May and June, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimate that 5·7% (95% CI 5·1-6·4) of adults in metropolitan France had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by May 11, 2020. This proportion remained stable until August, 2020, and increased to 14·9% (13·2-16·9) by Jan 15, 2021. With 26·5% (23·4-29·8) of adult residents having been infected in Île-de-France (Paris region) compared with 5·1% (4·5-5·8) in Brittany by January, 2021, regional variations remained large (coefficient of variation [CV] 0·50) although less so than in May, 2020 (CV 0·74). The proportion infected was twice as high (20·4%, 15·6-26·3) in 20-49-year-olds than in individuals aged 50 years or older (9·7%, 6·9-14·1). 40·2% (34·3-46·3) of infections in adults were detected in June to August, 2020, compared with 49·3% (42·9-55·9) in November, 2020, to January, 2021. Our regional estimates of seroprevalence were strongly correlated with the external validation dataset (coefficient of correlation 0·89). INTERPRETATION: Our simple approach to estimate the proportion of adults that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 can help to characterise the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, epidemic dynamics, and the performance of surveillance in different regions.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The COVID-19 pandemic has extensively impacted global healthcare systems. We hypothesized that the degree of psychological impact would be higher for surgical providers deployed for COVID-19 work, certain surgical specialties, and for those who knew of someone diagnosed with, or who died, of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a global web-based survey to investigate the psychological impact of COVID-19. The primary outcomes were the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scores. RESULTS: 4283 participants from 101 countries responded. 32.8%, 30.8%, 25.9% and 24.0% screened positive for depression, anxiety, stress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) respectively. Respondents who knew someone who died of COVID-19 were more likely to screen positive for depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD (OR 1.3, 1,6, 1.4, 1.7 respectively, all p < 0.05). Respondents who knew of someone diagnosed with COVID-19 were more likely to screen positive for depression, stress and PTSD (OR 1.2, 1.2 and 1.3 respectively, all p < 0.05). Surgical specialities that operated in the Head and Neck region had higher psychological distress among its surgeons. Deployment for COVID-19-related work was not associated with increased psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic may have a mental health legacy outlasting its course. The long-term impact of this ongoing traumatic event underscores the importance of longitudinal mental health care for healthcare personnel, with particular attention to those who know of someone diagnosed with, or who died of COVID-19.","Tan, Yi Quan; Wang, Ziting; Yap, Qai Ven; Chan, Yiong Huak; Ho, Roger C; Hamid, Agus Rizal Ardy Hariandy; Landaluce-Olavarria, Aitor; Pellino, Gianluca; Gauhar, Vineet; Chand, Manish; Wroclawski, Marcelo Langer; Hameed, B M Zeeshan; Ling, Samuel Ka-Kin; Sengupta, Shomik; Gallo, Gaetano; Chiu, Peter Ka-Fung; Tanidir, Yiloren; Tallada, M Pilar Villanova; Garcia, Bernardo Nunez; Colleoni, Ramiro; Abiddin, Zainal Adwin Zainal; Campi, Riccardo; Esperto, Francesco; Carrion, Diego; Elterman, Dean; Chung, Amanda Shu Jun; Ng, Anthony Chi Fai; Moschini, Marco; Rivas, Juan Gomez; Mayol, Julio; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Chiong, Edmund",Ann. surg,548,15

In this work, we chose a model plant, wheat, as the test material to determine the effects of applying 10 mg/kg S-ME to soil on its fresh weight, chlorophyll and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the diversity and structural composition of the phyllosphere microorganisms after 7 and 14 days of exposure. Our work showed that this concentration of residual S-ME in soil only slightly decreased plant biomass and had little effect on lipid peroxidation, the antioxidant enzyme system and chlorophyll content. Interestingly, although the test concentration of S-ME did not exert strong inhibitory effects on the physiological activities of wheat, it decreased the diversity of phyllosphere microbial communities and changed their structure, indicating that microorganisms were more sensitive stress indicators. S-ME reduced the colonization by some beneficial bacteria related to plant nitrogen fixation among the phyllosphere microorganisms, which influenced the growth and yield of wheat because these bacteria contribute to plant fitness. In addition, S-ME affected the association between the host and the composition of the phyllosphere microbial communities under different growth conditions. Our work provides insights into the ecological implications of the effects of herbicides on the phyllosphere microbiome.","Xu, Nuohan; Qu, Qian; Zhang, Zhenyan; Yuan, Wenting; Cui, Hengzheng; Shen, Yijia; Lin, Wei; Lu, Tao; Qian, Haifeng",Sci Total Environ,548,1

To address these questions, we fielded a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults in late April 2020 (N = 1,007). Results showed substantial self-reported exposure to conflicting information about COVID-19, with nearly 75% of participants reporting having recently heard such information from health experts, politicians, and/or others. Participants perceived disagreement across a range of COVID-19-related issues, though from politicians more than health experts.

Meanwhile, multiple-group path analysis was used to evaluate path differences between the models of two samples. The results of the mediation analysis for both samples demonstrated that depression significantly mediated the relationship between Type A personality and appetite and sleep disorder. The results of multiple-group path analysis showed that the relationship between Type A personality and appetite and sleep disorder seems to be significantly stronger in ordinary people, whereas the relationship between depression and appetite and sleep disorder, as well as with the path towards AST, seems to be significantly stronger in frontline anti-epidemic medical staff.

Our aim was to determine the real-life clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. METHODS: This population-based retrospective study was conducted in March-April 2020 in the Helsinki Capital Region, Finland. Adults who were clinically suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, with sufficient data in their medical records for grading of clinical suspicion were eligible. In addition to examining the first RT-PCR test of repeat-tested individuals, we also used high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 as the reference standard for calculating the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. RESULTS: All 1,194 inpatients (mean [SD] age, 63.2 [18.3] years; 45.2% women) admitted to COVID-19 cohort wards during the study period were included. The outpatient cohort of 1,814 individuals (mean [SD] age, 45.4 [17.2] years; 69.1% women) was sampled from epidemiological line lists by systematic quasi-random sampling. The sensitivity (95% CI) for laboratory confirmed cases (repeat-tested patients) was 85.7% (81.5-89.1%) inpatients; 95.5% (92.2-97.5%) outpatients, 89.9% (88.2-92.1%) all. When also patients that were graded as high suspicion but never tested positive were included in the denominator, the sensitivity (95% CI) was: 67.5% (62.9-71.9%) inpatients; 34.9% (31.4-38.5%) outpatients; 47.3% (44.4-50.3%) all. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing was only moderate at best.

Despite the widely hypothesized role of a cytokine storm in disease severity, no study thus far has explored the association between immunosuppression and disease severity in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the association between the use of immunosuppressant medication and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: Nine hundred and eighty-one consecutive patients hospitalized between 12 March 2020 and 15 April 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), were enrolled in this cohort study and subdivided by immunosuppression status. The patients were followed up for a minimum of 28 days (median 37 days) for the primary end-point of mortality. Secondary end-points included the composite of intubation or death, and the composite of mortality, intubation or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) requirement. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 354 (36.1%) of study patients died. The immunosuppressed cohort (n = 31) had significantly higher mortality rates (aHR: 2.067, 95% CI: 1.20-3.57, P = 0.009). There was no association between immunosuppression and the composite end-point of mortality or intubation (aHR: 1.49 95% CI: 0.88-2.51, P = 0.14) and of the composite end-point of mortality, intubation or CPAP (aHR: 1.36 95% CI: 0.81-2.30 P = 0.245).

Prior to COVID-19, the global burden of disease attributable to sedentary behavior disproportionately affected the health of people with disabilities (PWD). This pre-existing gap has only widened during COVID-19 due to limited disability-friendly digital exercise resources. The purpose of this work is to examine this gap in accessibility to digital fitness resources, and re-frame the notion of accessibility to suit the contemporary context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using machine learning, video titles/descriptions about home exercise ordered by relevance populated on YouTube between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2020 were examined. RESULTS: Using the search terms, ""home exercise,"" ""home-based exercise,"" ""exercise no equipment,"" ""workout no equipment,"" ""exercise at home,"" or ""at-home exercise,"" 700 videos ordered by relevance included 28 (4%) that were inclusive of participants with disabilities. Unfortunately, most digital fitness resources are therefore inaccessible to PWD. The global pause the pandemic has induced may be the right moment to construct a comprehensive, indexed digital library of home-based fitness video content for the disabled. There is a further need for more nuanced understandings of accessibility as technological advancements continue. Implications for Rehabilitation Physical activity is incredibly important to the quality of life and health of all people. Physical activity levels, however, remain lower among persons with disabilities. Access to disability-friendly resources remains a challenge and worsened by the circumstances of COVID-19 due to an apparent lack of digital fitness resources for persons with disabilities. A broader and comprehensive definition of accessibility must recognize digital advances and access to physical activity for persons with disabilities must feature digital resources.","Stratton, Catherine; Kadakia, Shevali; Balikuddembe, Joseph K; Peterson, Mark; Hajjioui, Abderrazak; Cooper, Rory; Hong, Bo-Young; Pandiyan, Uma; Muñoz-Velasco, Laura Paulina; Joseph, James; Krassioukov, Andrei; Tripathi, Deo Rishi; Tuakli-Wosornu, Yetsa A",Disabil Rehabil,548,16

A test should have high sensitivity; however, the sensitivity of the PCR test is highly influenced by viral load, which changes over time. Because it is difficult to collect data before the onset of symptoms, the current literature on the sensitivity of the PCR test before symptom onset is limited. In this study, we used a viral dynamics model to track the probability of failing to detect a case of PCR testing over time, including the presymptomatic period. The model was parametrized by using longitudinal viral load data collected from 30 hospitalized patients. The probability of failing to detect a case decreased toward symptom onset, and the lowest probability was observed 2 days after symptom onset and increased afterwards. The probability on the day of symptom onset was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.5 to 1.9) and that 2 days before symptom onset was 60.2% (95% CI: 57.1 to 63.2). Our study suggests that the diagnosis of COVID-19 by PCR testing should be done carefully, especially when the test is performed before or way after symptom onset.

This virus has emerged as a threat to global health, social stability, and the global economy. This pandemic continues to cause rampant mortality worldwide with the dire urgency to develop novel therapeutic agents. To meet this task, this article discusses advances in the research and potential application of bioactive peptides for possible mitigation of infection by SARS-CoV-2. Growing insight into the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2 has revealed potential druggable targets for bioactive peptides. Bioactive peptides with unique amino acid sequences can mitigate such targets including, type II transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS2) inhibition, furin cleavage, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) members. Based on current evidence and structure-function analysis, multiple bioactive peptides present potency to neutralize the virus. To date, no SARS-CoV-2-explicit drug has been reported, but we here introduce bioactive peptides in the perspective of their potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bhullar, Khushwant S; Drews, Steven J; Wu, Jianping",Eur J Pharmacol,548,1

Therefore, we need to develop environments in which infectious diseases and dangerous chemicals cannot be spread or misused so easily. Especially, those who put themselves in situations of most exposure - doctors, nurses and those protecting and caring for the safety of others - should be adequately protected. In this Review, we explore how the development of coatings for surfaces and functionalized fabrics can help to accelerate the inactivation of biological and chemical toxins. We start by looking at recent advancements in the use of metal and metal-oxide-based catalysts for the inactivation of pathogenic threats, with a focus on identifying specific chemical bonds that can be targeted. We then discuss the use of metal-organic frameworks on textiles for the capture and degradation of various chemical warfare agents and their simulants, their long-term efficacy and the challenges they face.","Jabbour, Christia R; Parker, Luke A; Hutter, Eline M; Weckhuysen, Bert M",Nat Rev Chem,548,29

Understanding the level of public attention-a prerequisite for effective communication-implicates expensive and time-consuming surveys. We hypothesise that the relative search volume from Google Trends could be used as an indicator of public attention of a disease and its prevention measures. The search terms 'RKI' (Robert Koch Institute, national public health authority in Germany), 'corona' and 'protective mask' in German language were shortlisted. Cross-correlations between these terms and the reported cases from 15 February to 27 April were conducted for each German federal state. The findings were contrasted against a timeline of official communications concerning COVID-19. The highest correlations of the term 'RKI' with reported COVID-19 cases were found between lags of - 2 and - 12 days, meaning web searches were already performed from 2 to 12 days before case numbers increased. A similar pattern was seen for the term 'corona'. Cross-correlations indicated that most searches on 'protective mask' were performed from 6 to 12 days after the peak of cases. The results for the term 'protective mask' indicate a degree of confusion in the population. This is supported by conflicting recommendations to wear face masks during the first wave. The relative search volumes could be a useful tool to provide timely and location-specific information on public attention for risk communication.","Kristensen, Kaja; Lorenz, Eva; May, Jürgen; Strauss, Ricardo",Sci Rep,548,2

Myocardial cytopathy associated with hypoxic response has been largely overlooked in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, histology analysis and cardiac function of COVID-19 cases are often reported separately, rendering an incomplete understanding of COVID-19 cardiac symptoms. ObjectiveTo examine the relationship between myocardial cellular responses to hypoxic stress versus cardiac functional alterations within the same COVID-19 patients. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsCellular hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 alpha (HIF1) expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using post-mortem COVID-19 heart and lung tissues with known cardiac echocardiography records from a total of 8 patients. Clinical echocardiography data were obtained from Mount Sinai Heart between March to December, 2020. All gender and age groups were considered as long as cardiac involvement meets the preserved (EF > 50%) or moderate to severe (EF < 45%) criteria with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cell-type specific subcellular localization of HIF1 expression and nuclear stability was examined by immunohistochemistry and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was used to quantify apoptosis. Main Outcomes and MeasuresNo planned outcomes of this study as this is a retrospective analysis based on post-mortem specimens exclusively. ResultsCardiac HIF1 expression was found to be significantly higher in patients with preserved EF levels than it was in the low EF group. In the preserved EF group, HIF1 is protective against apoptosis predominantly in endothelial cells and cardiac fibroblasts. In the low EF group, HIF1 protects cardiomyocyte nuclear integrity as evident by its nuclear accumulation with nuclear envelope preservation. Conclusions and RelevanceThis study establishes a direct link of cardiac cellular responses to hypoxic stress with matching functional and histological data, serving as one of the first studies to bridge previous stand-alone clinical data and cellular data. The protective role of HIF1 in hearts may help predict cardiac involvement in not only COVID-19 patients, but also decipher the underlying mechanisms in other forms of viral cardiomyopathy. KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAre hypoxic signaling pathways associated with cardiac functional alterations in COVID-19 patients? FindingsCardiac HIF1 expression of COVID-19 patients with EF>50% or EF<45% was analyzed and quantified. Increased cardiac HIF1+ cells were found in patients with higher EF. HIF1+ endothelial cells are resistant to apoptosis, and HIF1+ cardiomyocytes are able to retain nuclear envelope under hypoxic stress. MeaningHIF1 is cardioprotective in hearts of COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Bingyan Jessica; Vadakke-Madathil, Sangeetha; Croft, Lori B; Brody, Rachel I; Chaudhry, Hina W",,548,20

Objective: To evaluate the interferon (IFN)-&#945; levels in a cohort of COVID-19 patients in relation to severity, evolution of the clinical manifestations and immune/inflammatory profile. Methods: This is prospective study recruiting consecutive hospitalized patients with respiratory failure associated with SARS-COV-2 infection and matched controls. After enrollment, patients were assessed every 7 ± 2 days for additional 2 consecutive visits, for a total of 21 days. The severity of the clinical condition was ranked based on the level of respiratory support required. At each time-point blood samples were obtained to assess immune cells and mediators by multiplex immunoassay. Results: Fifty-four COVD-19 and 11 control patients matched for severity were enrolled. At recruitment, lower levels of blood IFN-&#945; were found in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (3.8-fold difference, p < 0.01). Improvements in COVID-19 severity were paralleled by a significant increase of blood IFN-&#945; levels. A significant increase in blood IFN-&#945; was found over the study period in survivors (70% of the study population). A similar trend was found for blood IFN-ß with IFN-ß levels below the threshold of detectability in a substantial proportion of subjects. Significantly higher values of blood lymphocytes and lower levels of IL-10 were found at each time point in patients who survived compared to patients who died. In patients who clinically improved and survived during the study, we found an inverse association between IL-10 and IFN-&#945; levels. Conclusion: The study identifies a blood immune profile defined by deficient IFN-&#945; levels associated with increased IL-10 expression in patients progressing to severe/life threatening COVID-19 conditions, suggesting the involvement of immunological pathways that could be target of pharmacological intervention.

Consequently, it is not surprising that ones related to the Covid-19 pandemic are proliferating given the lack of any authoritative scientific consensus on the virus, its spread and containment, or on the long term social and economic ramifications of the pandemic. Among the stories currently circulating are ones suggesting that the 5G network activates the virus, that the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated by a global cabal, that the virus is a bio-weapon released deliberately by the Chinese, or that Bill Gates is using it as cover to launch a global surveillance regime. While some may be quick to dismiss these stories as having little impact on real-world behavior, recent events including the destruction of property, racially fueled attacks against Asian Americans, and demonstrations espousing resistance to public health orders countermand such conclusions. Inspired by narrative theory, we crawl social media sites and news reports and, through the application of automated machine-learning methods, discover the underlying narrative frameworks supporting the generation of these stories. We show how the various narrative frameworks fueling rumors and conspiracy theories rely on the alignment of otherwise disparate domains of knowledge, and consider how they attach to the broader reporting on the pandemic.

The structure and function of nodes can vary significantly, with vital nodes playing a crucial role in information spread and other spreading phenomena. Identifying and taking action on vital nodes enables change to the network's structure and function more efficiently. Previous work either redefines metrics used to measure the nodes' importance or focuses on developing algorithms to efficiently find vital nodes. These approaches typically rely on global knowledge of the network and assume that the structure of the network does not change over time, both of which are difficult to achieve in the real world. In this paper, we propose a localized strategy that can find vital nodes without global knowledge of the network. Our joint nomination (JN) strategy selects a random set of nodes along with a set of nodes connected to those nodes, and together they nominate the vital node set. Experiments are conducted on 12 network datasets that include synthetic and real-world networks, and undirected and directed networks. Results show that average degree of the identified node set is about 3-8 times higher than that of the full node set, and higher-degree nodes take larger proportions in the degree distribution of the identified vital node set. Removal of vital nodes increases the average shortest path length by 20-70% over the original network, or about 8-15% longer than the other decentralized strategies. Immunization based on JN is more efficient than other strategies, consuming around 12-40% less immunization resources to raise the epidemic threshold to [Formula: see text]. Susceptible-infected-recovered simulations on networks with 30% vital nodes removed using JN delays the arrival time of infection peak significantly and reduce the total infection scale to 15%. The proposed strategy can effectively identify vital nodes using only local information and is feasible to implement in the real world to cope with time-critical scenarios such as the sudden outbreak of COVID-19.","Dong, Zhihao; Chen, Yuanzhu; Tricco, Terrence S; Li, Cheng; Hu, Ting",Sci Rep,548,21

The aim of our study is to evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of this assay on previously tested SARS-CoV-2 people by conventional RT-PCR based approach in different settings, including initial diagnosis and clinical follow-up. METHODS: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Idylla SARS-CoV-2 Test, we retrieved 55 nasopharyngeal swabs, previously analysed by a fully validated assay, from symptomatic patients or from people who have been in close contact with COVID-19 positive cases. Discordant or high discrepant cases were further analysed by a third technique. In addition, a second subset of 14 nasopharyngeal swab samples with uncertain results (cycle threshold between 37 and 40), by using the fully validated assay, from patients with viral infection beyond day 21, were retrieved. RESULTS: Overall, Idylla showed a sensitivity of 93.9% and a specificity of 100.0%. In addition, in the additional 14 nasopharyngeal swab samples, only five (35.7%) featured a positive result by the Idylla SARS-CoV-2 Test.

However, there are no data on sex-specific differences in ACE2 expression. If there is a sex difference in the expression of ACE2 in the lung, this could theoretically explain the gender disparity in COVID-19 disease. More importantly, although modulation of ACE2 will certainly not provide a cure for the COVID-19 disease, modulation of ACE2 by sex hormone modulators, if they affect the expression of ACE2, could potentially be developed into a supportive therapy for COVID-19 patients.","Majdic, Gregor",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,548,30

However, data on the presence of these aerosols outside of patient rooms are limited. We investigated whether virus-containing aerosols were present in nursing stations and patient room hallways in a referral center with critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Eight National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health BC 251 two-stage cyclone samplers were set up throughout six units, including nursing stations and visitor corridors in intensive care units and general medical units, for six hours each sampling period. Samplers were placed on tripods which held two samplers positioned 102 cm and 152 cm above the floor. Units were sampled for three days. Extracted samples underwent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for selected gene regions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleocapsid and the housekeeping gene human RNase P as an internal control. RESULTS: The units sampled varied in the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients present on the days of sampling. Some of the units included patient rooms under negative pressure, while most were maintained at a neutral pressure. Of 528 aerosol samples collected, none were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the estimated limit of detection of 8 viral copies/m 3 of air. CONCLUSION: Aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 outside of patient rooms was undetectable.

We aimed to describe the practice of ventilation management and to establish outcomes in invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 in a single country during the first month of the outbreak. METHODS: PRoVENT-COVID is a national, multicentre, retrospective observational study done at 18 intensive care units (ICUs) in the Netherlands. Consecutive patients aged at least 18 years were eligible for participation if they had received invasive ventilation for COVID-19 at a participating ICU during the first month of the national outbreak in the Netherlands. The primary outcome was a combination of ventilator variables and parameters over the first 4 calendar days of ventilation: tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), respiratory system compliance, and driving pressure. Secondary outcomes included the use of adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia and ICU complications. Patient-centred outcomes were ventilator-free days at day 28, duration of ventilation, duration of ICU and hospital stay, and mortality. PRoVENT-COVID is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04346342). FINDINGS: Between March 1 and April 1, 2020, 553 patients were included in the study. Median tidal volume was 6·3 mL/kg predicted bodyweight (IQR 5·7-7·1), PEEP was 14·0 cm H2O (IQR 11·0-15·0), and driving pressure was 14·0 cm H2O (11·2-16·0). Median respiratory system compliance was 31·9 mL/cm H2O (26·0-39·9). Of the adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia, prone positioning was most often used in the first 4 days of ventilation (283 [53%] of 530 patients). The median number of ventilator-free days at day 28 was 0 (IQR 0-15); 186 (35%) of 530 patients had died by day 28. Predictors of 28-day mortality were gender, age, tidal volume, respiratory system compliance, arterial pH, and heart rate on the first day of invasive ventilation. INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19 who were invasively ventilated during the first month of the outbreak in the Netherlands, lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volume and low driving pressure was broadly applied and prone positioning was often used. The applied PEEP varied widely, despite an invariably low respiratory system compliance. The findings of this national study provide a basis for new hypotheses and sample size calculations for future trials of invasive ventilation for COVID-19. These data could also help in the interpretation of findings from other studies of ventilation practice and outcomes in invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19.

We show that convalescent-phase sera neutralize pseudotyped viruses with the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.1.248, COH.20G/677H, 20A.EU2, and mink cluster 5 spike proteins with only a minor loss in titer. Similarly, antibodies elicited by Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccination neutralized B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 with only a 3-fold decrease in titer, an effect attributable to E484K. Analysis of the Regeneron monoclonal antibodies REGN10933 and REGN10987 showed that REGN10933 has lost neutralizing activity against the B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 pseudotyped viruses, and the cocktail is 9- to 15-fold decreased in titer. These findings suggest that antibodies elicited by natural infection and by the Pfizer vaccine will maintain protection against the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.1.248 variants but that monoclonal antibody therapy may be less effective for patients infected with B.1.351 or B.1.1.248 SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised concerns with regard to their potential to escape from vaccine-elicited antibodies and anti-spike protein monoclonal antibodies. We report here on an analysis of sera from recovered patients and vaccinated individuals and on neutralization by Regeneron therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Overall, the variants were neutralized nearly as well as the wild-type pseudotyped virus. The B.1.351 variant was somewhat resistant to vaccine-elicited antibodies but was still readily neutralized. One of the two Regeneron therapeutic monoclonal antibodies seems to have lost most of its activity against the B.1.351 variant, raising concerns that the combination therapy might be less effective for some patients. The findings should alleviate concerns that vaccines will become ineffective but suggest the importance of continued surveillance for potential new variants.","Tada, Takuya; Dcosta, Belinda M; Samanovic, Marie I; Herati, Ramin S; Cornelius, Amber; Zhou, Hao; Vaill, Ada; Kazmierski, Wes; Mulligan, Mark J; Landau, Nathaniel R",mBio,548,15

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a self-efficacy theory-based health information technology intervention implemented through blood control and patient self-management. DESIGN: A clinical randomized waitlist-controlled trial. METHODS: The study was conducted at a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. A total of 60 subjects were randomly assigned to either the immediate intervention (experimental) group or the waitlist control group. The primary endpoint was systolic blood pressure at 3 months; secondary end points included self-management behavior and QOL. Treatment for the immediate intervention group lasted 3 months, while the waitlist control group received routine care for the first 3 months, at which point they crossed over to the intervention arm and received the same intervention as the experimental group for another 3 months. Both groups were evaluated by questionnaires and physiological measurements at both 3 and 6 months postadmission. The results were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure significantly improved for the intervention group participants at 3 months, when there was also significant improvement in self-management behavior and QOL. There was no significant or appreciable effect of time spent in the waitlist condition, with treatments in the two conditions being similarly effective. CONCLUSION: The use of a theory-based health information technology treatment compared with usual care resulted in a significant improvement in systolic blood pressure, self-management behavior, and QOL in patients with coronary artery disease. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This treatment would be a useful strategy for clinical care of cardiovascular disease patients, improving their disease self-management. It also may help guide further digital health care strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hong, Pei-Chen; Chen, Kuan-Jung; Chang, Yue-Cune; Cheng, Shu-Meng; Chiang, Hui-Hsun",J. nurs. scholarsh,548,20

Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of the non-neovascular (dry) type of AMD. Late-stage clinical trials suggest that intravitreal injections of novel therapeutics may slow down the rate of GA progression by up to 30% in 1 year, thus allowing people with GA to preserve central vision for a longer period. While intravitreal injections have become an established treatment modality for neovascular (wet) AMD, it is unknown whether patients with (more gradually progressing) GA would accept regular injections that slow down, but do not stop or reverse, vision loss. Therefore, this mixed-methods pilot study will aim to explore whether regular intravitreal injections will be acceptable as treatment for patients with GA, and the factors that may affect treatment acceptability. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A mixed-methods survey has been designed in collaboration with a GA patient advisory group. The survey comprises of structured questionnaires, semi-structured interview questions regarding patients' perceptions of intravitreal injections and the burden of treatment, and a task eliciting preferences between different potential treatments. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, this study will be conducted remotely by telephone. Thirty individuals will be recruited from NHS Medical Retina clinics at Central Middlesex Hospital, London. Half of the participants will be naïve to intravitreal injections, while half will have previous experience of intravitreal injections for neovascular (wet) AMD. Qualitative data analysis will be conducted using the Framework Method of analysis to identify key themes from participants' accounts. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study received Health Research Authority approval on 23 March 2021 (IRAS Project ID: 287824). Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations to the medical retina community, as well as through dialogue with patients and macular disease charities.","Enoch, Jamie; Ghulakhszian, Arevik; Crabb, David P; Dinah, Christiana; Taylor, Deanna J",BMJ Open,548,15

This study was conducted to determine whether noninvasive urine biomarkers can predict the clinical severity of coronavirus disease 2019. Interventions: Not applicable. Measurements and Main Results: This is single-center study, national center hospital designated for infectious disease. Fifty-eight patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in respiratory specimens through real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were retrospectively studied. Urinary ß2-microglobulin, liver-type fatty acid-binding protein were serially measured. Serum interferon-Î³ and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 were also evaluated. The 58 patients were assigned into three groups. Patients requiring intensive care were assigned to the severe group (n = 12). Patients treated with oxygen were assigned to the moderate group (n = 13). Other patients were assigned to the mild group (n = 33). Urine tests revealed that low ß2-microglobulin and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein levels were associated with mild disease, whereas high levels were associated with severe disease. In severe cases, liver-type fatty acid-binding protein tended to be persistently high. The resulting cutoff values were ß2-microglobulin; severe versus moderate + mild: 2,457 µg/dL (specificity 76.9% and sensitivity 90.0%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 85.9%), liver-type fatty acid-binding protein; severe versus moderate + mild: 22.0 µg/gCre (specificity 84.6% and sensitivity 90%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 91.8%). Urinary ß2-microglobulin and serum interferon-Î³/monocyte chemotactic protein-1 showed a similar trend. Conclusions: Evaluating urinary biomarkers such as ß2-microglobulin and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein may allow determination of coronavirus disease 2019 patients with active cytokines and recognition of patients likely to become critically ill and requiring careful observation and early intervention.","Katagiri, Daisuke; Ishikane, Masahiro; Asai, Yusuke; Kinoshita, Noriko; Ota, Masayuki; Moriyama, Yuki; Ide, Satoshi; Nakamura, Keiji; Nakamoto, Takato; Nomoto, Hidetoshi; Akiyama, Yutaro; Miyazato, Yusuke; Suzuki, Tetsuya; Okuhama, Ayako; Kanda, Kohei; Wakimoto, Yuji; Morioka, Shinichiro; Saito, Sho; Yamamoto, Kei; Ujiie, Mugen; Hayakawa, Kayoko; Kustuna, Satoshi; Yanagawa, Yasuaki; Terada, Junko; Takasaki, Jin; Izumi, Shinyu; Hojo, Masayuki; Hinoshita, Fumihiko; Sugiyama, Masaya; Noiri, Eisei; Mizokami, Masashi; Ohmagari, Norio; Sugiyama, Haruhito",Crit Care Explor,548,16

Next, we use ReScan, a method to efficiently sequester phage expressing the most immunogenic peptides and print them onto paper-based microarrays using acoustic liquid handling, which isolates and identifies nine candidate antigens, eight of which are derived from the two proteins used for SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays: spike and nucleocapsid proteins. After deployment in a high-throughput assay amenable to clinical lab settings, these antigens show improved specificity over a whole protein panel.

Despite evidence-based guidelines, antibiotics are still commonly used to treat infections likely caused by respiratory viruses. In this study, we examined the temporal relationships between antibiotic usage and respiratory infections in the Republic of Korea. METHODS: The number of monthly antibiotic prescriptions and the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections between 2010 and 2015 at all primary care clinics were obtained from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. The monthly detection rates of respiratory viruses, including adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, human coronavirus, and human rhinovirus, were collected from Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cross-correlation analysis was conducted to quantify the temporal relationship between antibiotic use and respiratory virus activities as well as respiratory infections in primary clinics. RESULTS: The monthly use of different classes of antibiotic, including penicillins, other beta-lactam antibacterials, macrolides and quinolones, was significantly correlated with influenza virus activity. These correlations peaked at the 0-month lag with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.45 (p < 0.01), 0.46 (p < 0.01), 0.40 (p < 0.01), and 0.35 (< 0.01), respectively. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between acute bronchitis and antibiotics, including penicillin (0.73, p < 0.01), macrolides (0.74, p < 0.01), and quinolones (0.45, p < 0.01), at the 0-month lag. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there is a significant temporal relationship between influenza virus activity and antibiotic use in primary clinics. This relationship indicates that interventions aimed at reducing influenza cases in addition to effort to discourage the prescription of antibiotics by physicians may help to decrease unnecessary antibiotic consumption.","Ryu, Sukhyun; Kim, Sojung; Kim, Bryan I.; Klein, Eili Y.; Yoon, Young Kyung; Chun, Byung Chul",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,548,22

If infection and related mortality are associated with social background, it is therefore natural to study variation in them in relation to the social composition of local areas. The first part of the paper studies the geographical impact of Covid-19 infection on age-standardised sex-specific excess death rates during the peak months of the pandemic so far, March through May 2020. The second part examines monthly mortality dynamics in relation to predictions from a spatial SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model of infection introduced by Bisin and Moro (2020). The analysis indicates that during the peak months of the Covid-19 pandemic, a larger non-white population and higher social deprivation in an area were associated with higher excess mortality, particularly among men. Regarding dynamics, higher population density accelerated the growth in mortality during the upsurge in infection and increased its rate of decline after the peak of the epidemic, thereby producing a more peaked mortality profile. There is also evidence of a slower post-peak decline in mortality in more socially deprived areas but a more rapid decline in areas with a larger non-white population.","Breen, R.; Ermisch, J.",,548,28

With written home exercise programs being the commonly prescribed form of rehabilitation after discharge, mobile health technology coupled with task-oriented programs can enhance self-management of upper extremity training. In the current study, a rehabilitation system, namely mRehab, was designed that included a smartphone app and 3D-printed household items such as mug, bowl, key, and doorknob embedded with a smartphone. The app interface allowed the user to select rehabilitation activities and receive feedback on the number of activity repetitions completed, time to complete each activity, and quality of movement. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the usability, perceived usefulness, and acceptance of the mRehab system by individuals with stroke and identify the challenges experienced by them when using the system remotely in a home-based setting. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was used with 11 individuals with chronic stroke. Following training, individuals with stroke used the mRehab system for 6 weeks at home. Each participant completed surveys and engaged in a semistructured interview. Participants’ qualitative reports regarding the usability of mRehab were integrated with their survey reports and quantitative performance data. RESULTS: Of the 11 participants, 10 rated the mRehab system between the 67.5th and 97.5th percentile on the System Usability Scale, indicating their satisfaction with the usability of the system. Participants also provided high ratings of perceived usefulness (mean 5.8, SD 0.9) and perceived ease of use (mean 5.3, SD 1.5) on a 7-point scale based on the Technology Acceptance Model. Common themes reported by participants showed a positive response to mRehab with some suggestions for improvements. Participants reported an interest in activities they perceived to be adequately challenging. Some participants indicated a need for customizing the feedback to be more interpretable. Overall, most participants indicated that they would like to continue using the mRehab system at home. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing usability in the lived environment over a prolonged duration of time is essential to identify the match between the system and users’ needs and preferences. While mRehab was well accepted, further customization is desired for a better fit with the end users.

While in the Americas the condition is described as a fatal disease, in Europe, reports on the clinical expression of the infection are scarce. This study describes the first case of Cytauxzoon sp. infection in Germany, in a domestic cat. A 6-year-old male domestic cat living in Saarlouis (Saarland) was presented with anorexia, lethargy and weight loss. The cat had an outdoor lifestyle and had not travelled abroad. Serum clinical chemistry analysis revealed azotaemia with markedly increased symmetric dimethylarginine, hypercreatinemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypoalbuminemia. Moreover, a mild non-regenerative anaemia was present. Approximately 1 year prior to these findings, the domestic cat was diagnosed with a feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection. These results pointed toward a decreased glomerular filtration rate, presumably as a result of kidney dysfunction. Round to oval signet ring–shaped intraerythrocytic organisms, morphologically suggestive for a piroplasm, were revealed during blood smear evaluation with a degree of parasitaemia of 33.0%. PCR analyses and sequencing of a region of the 18S rRNA gene confirmed the presence of a Cytauxzoon sp. infection, with 99–100% nucleotide sequence identity with previously published Cytauxzoon sp. isolates. As this is the first molecularly confirmed Cytauxzoon sp. infection in a domestic cat in Germany, these findings suggest that cytauxzoonosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of anaemia in outdoor domestic cats, particularly in areas where wild felid populations are present.","Panait, Luciana Cătălina; Stock, Graham; Globokar, Majda; Balzer, Jörg; Groth, Bernhard; Mihalca, Andrei Daniel; Pantchev, Nikola",Parasitol Res,548,24

Unfortunately, many questions concerning the pathophysiology, management, and long-term side effects remain unanswered, and novel aspects of the disease keep on emerging. Of concern to healthcare providers are the recent reported cases of reinfection. Serum coronavirus disease 2019 antibodies have been detected within a few days after onset of the disease. However, it remains unclear whether this immune response is universal, or whether it can lead to latent immunity. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 27-year-old white man presented with fever, chills, back pain, and other constitutional symptoms, 2 days after being exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients. His severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction was positive, and his symptoms resolved over the next 2 weeks. One month after a confirmatory negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction, he was found to be ineligible for plasma donation as his anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 serology was negative. The patient redeveloped symptoms similar to his first infection 3 weeks after the negative serology test. He and his wife both tested positive via polymerase chain reaction. Their symptoms resolved over the next few days, and they had a negative polymerase chain reaction test 10 days after the positive polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: While studies showed that anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulins start to develop early after infection, our healthy young patient’s immune system failed to mount latent immunity against the virus. This left him, especially amid widespread social and medical misconceptions, vulnerable to reinfection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Our case disputes the timelines for immune response that were set and supported by research studies. Our case also raises questions regarding prioritizing vaccinating other individuals over those with prior infection.","Awada, Hussein; Nassereldine, Hasan; Hajj Ali, Adel",J Med Case Rep,548,1

Accurate clinical characterisation studies are essential to informing research, diagnosis and clinical management efforts, particularly early in a pandemic. In this scoping review we identify the clinical characteristics of patients admitted to hospital in the early months of the pandemic, focusing on symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, and clinical outcomes. Methods: A scoping review. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases were searched studies published from January 1st 2020 to April 28th 2020. Studies which reported on at least 100 hospitalised patients with covid-19 of any age were included. Results: Of 1,249 studies identified through the search 78 studies were eligible for inclusion; one randomized control trial and 77 observational studies presenting data on 77,443 patients admitted with covid-19. Most studies were conducted in China (82%), 9% in the US and 10% in Europe and two studies were set in more than one country. No studies included patients from low and middle income countries. Coagulopathy was underrecognised as a complication in the early months of the pandemic. Use of corticosteroids varied widely, and the use of anticoagulants was reported in only one study. Fever, cough and dyspnoea are less common in older adults; gastrointestinal symptoms, as the only presenting feature may be underrecognised. The most common laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia. Inflammatory biomarkers were commonly elevated, including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Typical computed tomography findings include bilateral infiltrates however imaging may be normal in early disease. Data on clinical characteristics in children and vulnerable populations were limited. Conclusions: Clinical characterisation studies from early in the pandemic indicated that covid-19 is a multisystem disease, with biomarkers indicating inflammation and coagulopathy. However, early data collection on symptoms and clinical outcomes did not consistently reflect this wide spectrum. Corticosteroid use varied widely, and anticoagulants were rarely used. Clinicians should remain vigilant to the possibility of covid-19 in patients presenting without fever, cough and dyspnoea, particularly in older adults.

However, to our best knowledge, data on the characteristics and incidence of dysphagia associated with COVID-19 are lacking, especially in non-intubated patients. Therefore, we investigated the onset of swallowing disorders in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who have not been treated with invasive ventilation, in order to evaluate how the virus affected swallowing function regardless of orotracheal intubation. METHODS: We evaluated 41 patients admitted to the COVID department of our Hospital when they had already passed the acute phase of the disease and were therefore asymptomatic but still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. We examined patients’ clinical history and performed the Volume-Viscosity Swallow Test (VVST). Each patient also answered the Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire (SDQ). After 6 months, we performed a follow-up in patients with swallowing disorders. RESULTS: Eight of 41 patients (20%) presented with dysphagia symptoms during hospitalization and 2 of them (25%) still presented a SDQ high score and swallowing disorders with liquid consistency after 6 months. CONCLUSION: Non-intubated patients can experience various grades of swallowing impairment that probably directly related to pulmonary respiratory function alterations and viral direct neuronal lesive activity. Although these symptoms show natural tendency to spontaneous resolution, their impact on a general physical impaired situation should not be underestimated, since it can adversely affect patients’ recovery from COVID-19 worsening health outcomes.","Grilli, Gianluigi Mariano; Giancaspro, Rossana; Del Colle, Anna; Quarato, Carla Maria Irene; Lacedonia, Donato; Foschino Barbaro, Maria Pia; Cassano, Michele",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,548,24

METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on pneumonia treatment using a combination of Yinqiao powder and western medicine was performed in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, Weipu (VIP) and CBM. The retrieval time limit was from the establishment of the database to June 2020. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data and evaluated the bias risk of the included studies. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3 software. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULT: Fifteen RCTs involving 1705 patients were included in the analysis. The meta-analysis results revealed the total effective rate of the treatment group [RR = 1.21, 95% CI (1.15, 1.27), P < 0.00001], bacterial clearance rate [RR = 1.13, 95% CI (1.05, 1.22), P = 0.001], adverse reactions [RR = 0.54, 95% CI (0.38, 0.76), P = 0.0005]. There were statistically significant differences in the cooling time, T cell number, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) value decline rate (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the decline rate of neutrophils and leukocytes (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The current evidence indicated that the Yinqiao powder combined with western medicine can improve total efficiency in the treatment of pneumonia patients. The combination therapy performed better when compared to western medicine alone in the cooling time, bacterial clearance rate, T cell count, decline rates of CRP and PCT as well as in the incidences of adverse reactions. However, there was no significant difference in the decline rates of neutrophils and leucocytes between the two groups. The funnel plot, Egger's test and Begg's test indicated publication bias, which may be associated with unpublished negative study results. Due to the limitation of the quality and quantity of the included studies, more high-quality studies should be performed to verify our conclusions.","Fan, Yihua; Liu, Wei; Wan, Renhong; Du, Shaopeng; Wang, Aihua; Xie, Qing; Yang, Rumeng",Complement Ther Clin Pract,548,27

In this process, inefficient gas exchange in the alveolar could precipitate silent nonclinical hypoxemia. Unfortunately, patients with “silent hypoxemia” do not necessarily experience any breathing difficulty (dyspnea) at the early stage of COVID-19 while the disease progresses. As a result, several asymptomatic, presymptomatic and patients with mild symptoms may escape quarantine measure and thus continue to spread the virus through contacts. Therefore, early diagnosis of “silent hypoxemia”, which attracts no clinical warnings, could be an important diagnostic measure to prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome from the risk of pulmonary failure among the presymptomatic and as a screening tool in the asymptomatic who are hitherto potential spreaders of the virus.","Adedokun, Kamoru Ademola",Mil Med Res,548,29

UV-based technologies represent promising IPC tools: their effective application for sanitation has been extensively evaluated in the past but scant, heterogeneous and not conclusive evidence is available on their effect on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: With the aim of pooling the available evidence on the efficacy of UV technologies against coronaviruses, we conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, searching Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library, and the main clinical trials’ registries (WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane and EU Clinical Trial Register). Quantitative data on studies’ interventionS were summarized in tables, pooled by different coronavirus species and strain, UV source, characteristics of UV light exposure and outcomes. FINDINGS: Eighteen papers met our inclusion criteria, published between 1972 and 2020. Six focused on SARS-CoV-2, four on SARS-CoV-1, one on MERS-CoV, three on seasonal coronaviruses, and four on animal coronaviruses. All were experimental studies. Overall, despite wide heterocenicity within included studies, complete inactivation of coronaviruses on surfaces or aerosolized, including SARS-CoV-2, was reported to take a maximum exposure time of 15 minutes and to need a maximum distance from the UV emitter up to 1 meter. CONCLUSION: Advances in UV-based technologies in the field of sanitation and their proved high virucidal potential against SARS-CoV-2 support their use for IPC in hospital and community settings and their contribution towards ending the COVID-19 pandemic.

This has been eroded by colonisation, dispossession and increasing food and water insecurity due to climate change and supply constraints. Globally, indigenous peoples experience a disproportionate burden of chronic disease and poor nutrition is a major risk factor. Indigenous leaders have been advocating for community-led solutions. The primary aim of this systematic review is to determine what community-led programs have been undertaken to address food and/or water security globally. A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed literature will be performed in EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, LILACs, Informit and Business Source Premier. The grey literature search will include grey literature databases, customised Google search engines, targeted websites, and consultation with experts.

The ever-growing list of globally spread corona virus-19 disease (COVID-19) patients has demonstrated the high transmission rate among the human population. Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs or vaccines to prevent and treat the infection of the SARS-CoV-2. Considering the current state of affairs, there is an urgent unmet medical need to identify novel and effective approaches for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by re-evaluating the knowledge of traditional medicines and repurposing of drugs. Here, we used molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation approach to explore the beneficial roles of phytochemicals and active pharmacological agents present in the Indian herbs which are widely used in the preparation of Ayurvedic medicines in the form of Kadha to control various respiratory disorders such as cough, cold and flu. Our study has identified an array of phytochemicals present in these herbs which have significant docking scores and potential to inhibit different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as other Coronavirus target proteins. The phytochemicals present in these herbs possess significant anti-inflammatory property. Apart from this, based on their pharmaceutical characteristics, we have also performed in-silico drug-likeness and predicted pharmacokinetics of the selected phytochemicals found in the Kadha. Overall our study provides scientific justification in terms of binding of active ingredients present in different plants used in Kadha preparation with viral proteins and target proteins for prevention and treatment of the COVID-19.

High income countries (HIC) seemingly account for the majority of the mortalities considering that these countries have screened more persons. Low middle income countries (LMIC) countries may experience far worse mortalities considering the existence of a weaker health care system and the several underlying population level morbidities. As a result, it becomes imperative to understand the ecological correlation between critical underlying population level morbidities and COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFR). Method: This is an ecological study using data on COVID-19 cases, prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, adult HIV prevalence, quality of air and life expectancy. We plotted a histogram, performed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and used spearman correlation to assess the degree of correlation between COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) and other covariates mentioned above. Result: As at the 31st of March 2020, there were a total of 846,281 cases of COVID-19 from 204 countries and a global case fatality rate of 5% (range 0% to 29%). Angola and Sudan both had the highest CFR of 29%, while Italy had the highest number of deaths (i.e. 12,428) as at 31st of March 2020. Adult HIV prevalence has a significant but weak negative correlation with CFR (correlation coefficient = - 0.24, p value =0.01) while all the other variables have positive correlation with CFR due to COVID-19 though not statistically significant. Of the 204 countries analyzed, only 11 countries (i.e. 5%) had complete datasets across all 5 population level morbidities (i.e. prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, life expectancy, quality of air, and adult HIV prevalence variables). Correlations of CFR from these 11 countries were similar to that from the 204 countries except for the correlation with quality of air and prevalence of tobacco use. Conclusion: While we interpret our data with caution given the fact that this is an ecological study, our findings suggest that population level factors such as prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, life expectancy and quality of air are positively correlated with CFR from COVID-19 but, adult HIV prevalence has a weak and negative correlation with COVID-19 CFR and would require extensive research.","OKPOKORO, E.; IGBINOMWANHIA, V.; JEDY-AGBA, E.; KAYODE, G.; ONYEMATA, E.; ABIMIKU, A.",,548,20

DESIGN: Analysis of Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) registry data, supplemented by an ICU surge capability survey and veterinary facilities survey (both March 2020). SETTINGS: All Australian ICUs and veterinary facilities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline numbers of ICU beds, ventilators, dialysis machines, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, intravenous infusion pumps, and staff (senior medical staff, registered nurses); incremental capability to increase capacity (surge) by increasing ICU bed numbers; ventilator‐to‐bed ratios; number of ventilators in veterinary facilities. RESULTS: The 191 ICUs in Australia provide 2378 intensive care beds during baseline activity (9.3 ICU beds per 100 000 population). Of the 175 ICUs that responded to the surge survey (with 2228 intensive care beds), a maximal surge would add an additional 4258 intensive care beds (191% increase) and 2631 invasive ventilators (120% increase). This surge would require additional staffing of as many as 4092 senior doctors (245% increase over baseline) and 42 720 registered ICU nurses (269% increase over baseline). An additional 188 ventilators are available in veterinary facilities, including 179 human model ventilators. CONCLUSIONS: The directors of Australian ICUs report that intensive care bed capacity could be near tripled in response to the expected increase in demand caused by COVID‐19. But maximal surge in bed numbers could be hampered by a shortfall in invasive ventilators and would also require a large increase in clinician and nursing staff numbers.","Litton, Edward; Bucci, Tamara; Chavan, Shaila; Ho, Yvonne Y; Holley, Anthony; Howard, Gretta; Huckson, Sue; Kwong, Philomena; Millar, Johnny; Nguyen, Nhi; Secombe, Paul; Ziegenfuss, Marc; Pilcher, David",Med J Aust,548,16

AIM: First, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of five SARS-CoV-2 rapid nucleocapsid protein antigen detection (RAD) assays (Biosynex, Biotical, Orient Gene, Panbio, SD Biosensor). Secondly, we described the performance and impact of the implementation of the SD Biosensor assay at our emergency department. METHODS: Sensitivity and specificity of the five RAD assays were analyzed on 100 respiratory samples: 60 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, 24 SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative samples and 16 samples positive for other respiratory pathogens. We adapted the manufacturer’s protocol, to validate the antigen tests on transport media used for rRT-PCR in our routine practice. The SD Biosensor RAD assay was implemented as screening method for rapid diagnosis and targeted admission. FINDINGS: Sensitivity of the included RAD assays ranged from 88.9% to 100% for samples with Ct <26, specificity from 46.2% to 100%. During the implementation period, 4195 RAD tests were performed. Due to the rapid RAD result, 157 patients were transferred directly to the COVID-19 cohort instead of the regular ward (n=47) or the temporary COVID-19 ward (n=110). CONCLUSION: The SD Biosensor, Biotical and Panbio SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests had an acceptable overall performance and seem to be able to detect most of the contagious patients. In the context of high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, RAD tests can be used as a rapid screening tool, to guide infection prevention measures and aid targeted admission.","Van Honacker, Eveline; Van Vaerenbergh, Kristien; Boel, An; De Beenhouwer, Hans; Leroux-Roels, Isabel; Cattoir, Lien",J Hosp Infect,548,8

Further, pulmonary complication rates have risen during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This study explored the potential cost-effectiveness of administering preoperative chlorhexidine mouthwash versus no-mouthwash at reducing postoperative pneumonia among abdominal surgery patients. METHODS: A decision analytic model taking the South African healthcare provider perspective was constructed to compare costs and benefits of mouthwash versus no-mouthwash-surgery at 30 days after abdominal surgery. We assumed two scenarios: (i) the absence of COVID-19; (ii) the presence of COVID-19. Input parameters were collected from published literature including prospective cohort studies and expert opinion. Effectiveness was measured as proportion of pneumonia patients. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of parameter uncertainties. The results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis were presented using cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: In the absence of COVID-19, mouthwash had lower average costs compared to no-mouthwash-surgery, $3,675 (R 63,770) versus $3,958 (R 68,683), and lower proportion of pneumonia patients, 0.029 versus 0.042 (dominance of mouthwash intervention). In the presence of COVID-19, the increase in pneumonia rate due to COVID-19, made mouthwash more dominant as it was more beneficial to reduce pneumonia patients through administering mouthwash. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves shown that mouthwash surgery is likely to be cost-effective between $0 (R0) and $15,000 (R 260,220) willingness to pay thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Both the absence and presence of SARS-CoV-2, mouthwash is likely to be cost saving intervention for reducing pneumonia after abdominal surgery. However, the available evidence for the effectiveness of mouthwash was extrapolated from cardiac surgery; there is now an urgent need for a robust clinical trial on the intervention on non-cardiac surgery.","Kachapila, Mwayi; Ademuyiwa, Adesoji O.; Biccard, Bruce M.; Ghosh, Dhruva N.; Glasbey, James; Monahan, Mark; Moore, Rachel; Morton, Dion G.; Oppong, Raymond; Pearse, Rupert; Roberts, Tracy E.",PLoS One,548,1

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January 1, 2020, and February 1, 2020, based on a questionnaire that was published on WhatsApp and Twitter. RESULTS: From 1001 participants who completed the questionnaire, 54% of them are female and 70% between the age group of 18 and 30 years. The most common reason to visit the pharmacy among the participants is to purchase over-the-counter medications (36.4%). Although (86.5%) reported that there is no pharmacy provide drive-thru service in their city, 78% of participants think that this service will help all the community component. Participants believe that the drive-thru service will help in reducing car parking problems and traffic violations (83.8% and 86.3%, respectively) and will help in keeping patient privacy and (82.2%). CONCLUSION: Establishing community pharmacy with drive-thru service is very important to ensure a more convenient service to customers and to assist all ages, women, and special needs.

Emerging reports suggest that people living in rural areas in some countries are more susceptible to COVID-19. However, there is a lack of quantitative evidence that can shed light on whether residents of rural areas are more concerned about COVID-19 than residents of urban areas. OBJECTIVE: This infodemiology study investigated attitudes toward COVID-19 in different Japanese prefectures by aggregating and analyzing Yahoo! JAPAN search queries. METHODS: We measured COVID-19 concerns in each Japanese prefecture by aggregating search counts of COVID-19–related queries of Yahoo! JAPAN users and data related to COVID-19 cases. We then defined two indices—the localized concern index (LCI) and localized concern index by patient percentage (LCIPP)—to quantitatively represent the degree of concern. To investigate the impact of emergency declarations on people's concerns, we divided our study period into three phases according to the timing of the state of emergency in Japan: before, during, and after. In addition, we evaluated the relationship between the LCI and LCIPP in different prefectures by correlating them with prefecture-level indicators of urbanization. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that the concerns about COVID-19 in the prefectures changed in accordance with the declaration of the state of emergency. The correlation analyses also indicated that the differentiated types of public concern measured by the LCI and LCIPP reflect the prefectures’ level of urbanization to a certain extent (ie, the LCI appears to be more suitable for quantifying COVID-19 concern in urban areas, while the LCIPP seems to be more appropriate for rural areas). CONCLUSIONS: We quantitatively defined Japanese Yahoo users’ concerns about COVID-19 by using the search counts of COVID-19–related search queries. Our results also showed that the LCI and LCIPP have external validity.","Gao, Zhiwei; Fujita, Sumio; Shimizu, Nobuyuki; Liew, Kongmeng; Murayama, Taichi; Yada, Shuntaro; Wakamiya, Shoko; Aramaki, Eiji",JMIR Public Health Surveill,548,0

Epidemics happening in prisons are compounding the elevated risks that COVID-19 poses to people of colour, older people, and those with comorbidities. Intersectoral community re-entry efforts in the USA and other countries have shown that releasing people from correctional facilities as a pandemic-era public health intervention is safe and can support both public safety and community rebuilding. Therefore, substantial decarceration in the USA should be initiated. A point of focus for such efforts is that many people in prison are serving excessively long sentences and pose acceptable safety risks for release. Properly managed, correctional depopulation will prevent considerable COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and reduce prevailing socioeconomic and health inequities.","Franco-Paredes, Carlos; Ghandnoosh, Nazgol; Latif, Hassan; Krsak, Martin; Henao-Martinez, Andres F; Robins, Megan; Vargas Barahona, Lilian; Poeschla, Eric M",Lancet Infect Dis,548,8

In parallel, we will gather qualitative data to provide a more in-depth understanding of how the BE may facilitate or hinder resident’s healthy living outcomes. METHODS: This project employs a quasi-experimental pre-post design with at least one or more intervention and control sites. The quantitative BE evaluation will include pre- and post-intervention assessments of neighbourhood macroscale (e.g., layout of communities) and microscale (e.g., street details and characteristics) changes using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Microscale Audit Pedestrian Streetscapes (MAPS) audits, respectively. The quantitative resident evaluation will include self-report (i.e., surveys) and objective assessments (i.e., accelerometers, Global Positioning System [GPS]) of residents at baseline (3-6-months pre-move-in) and follow-up (3-6-months and 9-12-months post-move-in if possible).

Analyzing data from nationally representative samples of workers in September 2019 and March 2020, the authors find that role blurring is associated with elevated status, but the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 weakens that effect. Likewise, schedule control enhances the status of role blurring, but its potency is also weakened during the pandemic. These findings align with the suggestion that role blurring signals a commitment to work and adherence to ideal worker norms. However, the pandemic changed that by intensifying role integration and possibly by reducing the degree of agency once associated with role blurring.

Second, coronavirus associated with common colds in children may offer some protection, due to cross-reactive humoral immunity and T cell immunity between common coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. Third, T helper 2 immune responses are protective in children. Fourth, surprisingly, eosinophilia, associated with T helper 2, may be protective. Fifth, children generally produce lower levels of inflammatory cytokines. Finally, the influence of the downturn in the global economy, the impact of living in quarters among families who are the most at risk, and factors including the openings of some schools, are considered.

In T cells, FURIN is critical for maintaining the T regulatory cell dependent peripheral immune tolerance and intact T helper cell polarization. The enzymatic activity of FURIN is directly associated with its expression levels, but genetic determinants for cell-type specific Furin gene regulation have remained elusive. By exploring the histone acetyltransferase p300 binding patterns in T helper cells, a putative regulatory region at ca. 20kB upstream of Furin gene was identified. When this region was deleted with CRISPR/Cas9 the production of Furin mRNA was significantly reduced in activated mouse T cells. Genome-wide RNA profiling by sequencing revealed that the novel Furin regulator region also impacted the expression of several genes that have previously been associated with the Th1 type hall mark cytokine IFNγ regulation or function. Finally, Furin genetic regulatory region was found to specifically promote the secretion of IFNγ by activated T cells. In sum, our data unravels the presence of Furin expression regulatory region in T cells that has characteristics of a super-enhancer for Th1 cell fate.","Ortutay, Zsuzsanna; Grönholm, Anna; Laitinen, Melina; Keresztes-Andrei, Melinda; Hermelo, Ismail; Pesu, Marko",Front Immunol,548,16

Recent reports have shown elevated levels of cytokines due to increased inflammation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease. On the other hand, obesity represents a state of low-grade inflammation, with various inflammatory products directly excreted by adipose tissue. In this concise report we aimed to assess common elements of obesity and SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Pubmed search on obesity and SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: We present “mechanistic” obesity-related problems that aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as tentative inflammatory/metabolic links between these diseases.

We aimed to retrospectively explore the clinical efficacy of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in conjunction with flexible bronchoscopy (FB) in allo‐HSCT patients with pulmonary infiltrates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing FB after allo‐HSCT at the Peking University Institute of Hematology from January 2013 to December 2016. We used PCR to detect various viruses in FB specimens, particularly for 27 viruses. RESULTS: One hundred forty‐nine diagnostic FBs were performed in 130 patients. The overall diagnostic yield was 58%. Eighty‐nine percent of the patients with a positive FB result were diagnosed with a pulmonary infection. Viruses were the most common infectious diagnosis (70%), followed by fungi (48%), bacteria (38%), and Pneumocystis jirovecii (12%). Multivariate analyses showed that a chest computed tomography (CT) finding of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates (P = .012) and positive results in assisted microbiological and serological analyses (P = .000) predicted a positive FB result.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate Korean citizens’ perceptions of vaccines by examining their views on COVID-19 vaccines, their positive and negative perceptions of each vaccine, and ways to enhance policies to increase vaccine acceptance. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed posts on NAVER and Instagram to examine Korean citizens’ perception of COVID-19 vaccines. The keywords searched were “vaccine,” “AstraZeneca,” and “Pfizer.” In total 8100 posts in NAVER and 5291 posts in Instagram were sampled through web crawling. Morphology analysis was performed, overlapping or meaningless words were removed, sentiment analysis was implemented, and 3 public health professionals reviewed the results. RESULTS: The findings revealed a negative perception of COVID-19 vaccines; of the words crawled, the proportion of negative words for AstraZeneca was 71.0% (476/670) and for Pfizer was 56.3% (498/885). Among words crawled with “vaccine,” “good” ranked first, with a frequency of 13.43% (312/2323). Meanwhile, “side effect” ranked highest, with a frequency of 29.2% (163/559) for “AstraZeneca,” but 0.6% (4/673) for “Pfizer.” With “vaccine,” positive words were more frequently used, whereas with “AstraZeneca” and “Pfizer” negative words were prevalent. CONCLUSIONS: There is a negative perception of AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines in Korea, with 1 in 4 people refusing vaccination. To address this, accurate information needs to be shared about vaccines including AstraZeneca, and the experiences of those vaccinated. Furthermore, government communication about risk management is required to increase the AstraZeneca vaccination rate for herd immunity before the vaccine expires.","Lee, Hocheol; Noh, Eun Bi; Park, Sung Jong; Nam, Hae Kweun; Lee, Tae Ho; Lee, Ga Ram; Nam, Eun Woo",JMIR Public Health Surveill,548,30

The former are NSP4-dependent, induce calcium-dependent chloride secretion and involve oxidative stress. Diosmectite (DS) is a natural clay that has been recommended as an active therapy for diarrhoea, but the mechanism of its effect is not clear. Electrical parameters may be used to measure the direct enterotoxic and cytotoxic effects in polar epithelial intestinal cells. To investigate the effects of DS on RV-induced enterotoxic and cytotoxic damage. Caco-2 cells were used as a model of RV infection to evaluate chloride secretion, epithelial integrity, oxidative stress and viral infectivity in Ussing chambers. RESULTS: Diosmectite reduced the expression of NSP4 and oxidative stress, resulting in a strong inhibition of chloride secretion. Preincubating RV with DS reduced the cytotoxic effect. Finally, the viral load was reduced by DS but not by control clay. This result suggests that DS specifically affects the early events of RV infection protecting the enterocyte, whereas it does not restore already-established cell damage. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that DS exerts an anti-diarrhoeal effect by inhibiting viral replication and the expression of NSP4. Both ion secretion and cell damage induced by RV are strongly inhibited consequent to the antiviral effect, which explains its clinical efficacy.","Buccigrossi, Vittoria; Russo, Carla; Guarino, Amedeo; de Freitas, Maiara Brusco; Guarino, Alfredo",Gut Pathog,548,16

To date, there are no proven drugs or vaccines against this virus. Hence, the situation demands an urgent need to explore all potential therapeutic strategies that can be made available to prevent the disease progression and improve patient outcomes. In absence of clinically proven treatment guidelines, several repurposed drugs and investigational agents are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for their probable benefits in the treatment of COVID-19. These include antivirals (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir, and favipiravir), interferon, antimalarials (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine), antiparasitic drugs (ivermectin and nitazoxanide), biologics (monoclonal antibodies and interleukin receptor antagonist), cellular therapies (mesenchymal stem cells and natural killer cells), convalescent plasma, and cytokine adsorber. Though several observational studies have claimed many of these agents to be effective based on their in vitro activities and extrapolated evidence from SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics, the currently available data remains inconclusive because of ill-defined patient selection criteria, small sample size, lack of concurrent controls, and use of intermediary outcomes instead of patient-relevant outcomes. Moreover, there is a need to clearly define the patient populations who warrant therapy and also the timing of initiation of treatment.

However, whether mobility restriction is a proportional response to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is unclear. We aimed to develop a model that can quantify the potential effects of various intracity mobility restrictions on the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: In this modelling study, we used anonymous and aggregated mobile phone sightings data to build a susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered transmission model for COVID-19 based on the city of Shenzhen, China. We simulated how disease spread changed when we varied the type and magnitude of mobility restrictions in different transmission scenarios, with variables such as the basic reproductive number (R(0)), length of infectious period, and the number of initial cases. FINDINGS: 331 COVID-19 cases distributed across the ten regions of Shenzhen were reported on Feb 7, 2020. In our basic scenario (R(0) of 2·68), mobility reduction of 20–60% within the city had a notable effect on controlling COVID-19 spread: a flattening of the peak number of cases by 33% (95% UI 21–42) and delay to the peak number by 2 weeks with a 20% restriction, 66% (48–75) reduction and 4 week delay with a 40% restriction, and 91% (79–95) reduction and 14 week delay with a 60% restriction. The effects of mobility restriction were increased when combined with reductions of 25% or 50% in transmissibility of the virus. In specific analyses of mobility restrictions for individuals with symptomatic infections and for high-risk regions, these measures also had substantial effects on reducing the spread of COVID-19. For example, the peak of the epidemic was delayed by 2 weeks if the proportion of individuals with symptomatic infections who could move freely was maintained at 20%, and by 4 weeks if two high-risk regions were locked down. The simulation results were also affected by various transmission parameters. INTERPRETATION: Our model shows the effects of various types and magnitudes of mobility restrictions on controlling COVID-19 outbreaks at the city level in Shenzhen, China. The model could help policy makers to establish the optimal combinations of mobility restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially to assess the potential positive effects of mobility restriction on public health in view of the potential negative economic and societal effects.

As of March 2020, 96 countries have ratified the MLC2006, covering more than 90% of the world’s shipping fleet. A system of port state control (PSC) allows ratifying countries to inspect any foreign ship arriving in their ports for compliance with the convention. It is intended as a second safety measure for the identification of substandard ships that sail all over the world. Nine regional agreements, so-called Memoranda of Understanding (MoU), have been signed to coordinate and standardize PSC inspections and to increase efficiency by sharing inspections and information. This paper uses public PSC statistics to evaluate the impact of the MLC2006. METHODS: A preliminary analysis using registered tonnage and MLC2006 ratification was conducted and seven MoU were selected for the analysis. The annual reports of these MoU have been viewed in September 2019. Numbers on annual inspections, deficiencies and detentions and in particular data for deficiencies related to living and working conditions and certificates and documents, have been extracted and analyzed for the years 2010 to 2017. RESULTS: Across the eight-year period analyzed, inspection numbers remained stable among all MoU authorities. Deficiencies overall and deficiencies related to WLC declined, indicating an improvement in conditions overall and an increased focus on seafarers’ conditions on board. After the MLC2006 entered into force, three MoU reported WLC-ratios above 14%, while the numbers didn’t rise above 10% in the other four authorities. Deficiencies related to certificates and documents did not rise significantly between 2010 and 2017. Two European MoU showed the highest ratios for deficiencies in both categories analyzed. CONCLUSION: The analysis confirmed that an increasing attention is being paid to the inspection of working and living conditions, especially in European countries. However, a clear positive impact of the MLC2006 could not be determined from the PSC statistics in this analysis. A large variation still exists among the MoU, a fact that demands increased efforts for harmonization of PSC procedures.

METHODS: This pilot study included CBR workers and CBR managers to inform feasibility, acceptability, and sustainable implementation. The RE-AIM and Dynamic Sustainability Framework were incorporated to guide procedural design, survey development, data collection, data evaluation, and increase success of telehealth implementation. CBR workers participate in trainings, telehealth sessions, surveys and focus groups to inform feasibility and acceptability. CBR Managers participated in focus groups to inform feasibility and sustainable implementation. NVIVO 12 Software was utilized to develop themes from CBR worker and CBR manager responses. RESULTS: Findings from this study demonstrate the need for additional training support for CBR workers in CBR settings throughout the entire treatment process. The telehealth system demonstrated successful short-term implementation across several domains of feasibility. Telehealth utilization was also proven acceptable, appropriate and necessary. Cultural beliefs, CBR worker training, and CBR Center infrastructure pose the most significant barriers to implementation of telehealth technologies in CBR Centers.

Design constitutes a fundamental part of what teachers do (Goodyear in HERDSA Rev Higher Educ 2:27–50, 2015). However, it has received negligible attention in the research literature. Bennett et al. make a significant contribution to knowledge by identifying and illustrating how university teachers engage in educational design. In particular, the paper identifies key areas for further support and the professional development of university teachers, including in the use of systematic design models and tools. This will help university teachers significantly, especially during the current pandemic has increased the design workload of university teachers as they endeavour to migrate and transtion their teaching online.

Since then, clinical trials with vaccines have been started and completed, and at present, 3 COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for use in the United States. Healthcare providers were among the first to get vaccinated, but the precise attitudes of healthcare workers toward vaccination are uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To understand residents and fellows’ attitudes toward vaccination and record any side effects after vaccination. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous survey that was open from 3-1-2021 to 3-12-2021 using distribution lists from the Graduate Medical Education office on the Lubbock campus of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center after getting approval from the Institutional Review Board (L21-088). RESULTS: Eighty-one residents and fellows (26.6% out of 304) responded to our survey. Among those who responded, 63 (77.8 %) were between 25 and 35 years old, and 41 (50.6%) were males. Seventy-seven (95.1%) received the vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), 78 (96.3%) reported that they supported vaccination, and 3 (3.7%) reported that they did not want vaccination. Eight members (9.8%) had tested positive for COVID-19 infection before vaccination, but only 1 (1.23%) had tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies. All residents and fellows reported side effects after the vaccination, including pain at the injection site (77; 100%), local redness (9; 11.6%), local swelling (13; 16.8%), fever (25; 32.5%), fatigue (25; 32.5%), chills (34; 44.1 %), headache (38; 49.4%).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the precautionary measure of social isolation on adults in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia. METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional survey design was carried out in the Asir region for a period of five months from May 2020 to September 2020 to assess the psychological response of the adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic using an anonymous online questionnaire. The questionnaire was adapted from previous research and involved three sections, namely sociodemographic data, patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the generalised anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7 Scale). A total score of ≥ 10 indicates depression and anxiety. Data was analysed using SPSS V.25. RESULTS Females had higher rates of COVID-19 depression than males. There was a significant correlation between age and home setting and anxiety, and a significant association between marital status and level of education and depression. There was a significant association between gender and depression and anxiety, while there was no significant association between occupation and income, and depression and anxiety. CONCLUSION The findings of the study clearly show that depression and anxiety are highly prevalent among adults. Females had higher rates of COVID-19 depression and anxiety than males. The findings from this study show that implementing a strategy for the prevention and management of depression and anxiety is highly recommended to minimise the impact of these disorders.","Kandasamy, Geetha; Almaghaslah, Dalia; Almanasef, Mona; Vasudevan, Rajalakshimi; Easwaran, Vigneshwaran; Chinnadhurai, Maheswari",International journal of clinical practice,548,1

A growing body of literature raises the issue of Vitamin C and Vitamin D as a risk-assessment tool, and therapeutic option, in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this pilot study was to measure serum Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels in a cohort of patients with critical COVID-19 illness in our community hospital ICU, correlate with other illness risk factors (age, BMI, HgbA1c, smoking status), generate hypotheses, and suggest further therapeutic intervention studies. METHOD: This pilot study included all 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients hospitalized in May 2020 in the ICU of North Suburban Medical Center, Thornton, Colorado, in whose care the principal investigator (C.A.) was involved. We measured patients' serum Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels, and standard risk factors like age, BMI, HbA1c, and smoking status. Variables in this study were gauged using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients (15 males and 6 females, 17 Hispanic and 4 Caucasian, of median age 61 years, range 20–94), there were 11 survivors. Serum levels of Vitamin C and Vitamin D were low in most of our critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients. Older age and low Vitamin C level appeared co-dependent risk factors for mortality from COVID-19 in our sample. Insulin resistance and obesity were prevalent in our small cohort, but smoking was not. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study found low serum levels of Vitamin C and Vitamin D in most of our critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients. Older age and low Vitamin C level appeared co-dependent risk factors for mortality. Many were also insulin-resistant or diabetic, overweight or obese, known as independent risk factors for low Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels, and for COVID-19. These findings suggest the need to further explore whether caring for COVID-19 patients ought to routinely include measuring and correcting serum Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels, and whether treating critically ill COVID-19 warrants acute parenteral Vitamin C and Vitamin D replacement.","Arvinte, Cristian; Singh, Maharaj; Marik, Paul E.",Med Drug Discov,548,24

In an outbreak, timely establishment of diagnostic routines is crucial to identifying cases and preventing the spread of the disease, especially when faced with high-consequence pathogens. In this article, we describe a multiagency exercise including the rapid deployment and diagnostic adaptation of the Swedish Armed Forces mobile laboratory (biological field analysis laboratory) in the context of COVID-19. This deployment was initiated as a high-readiness exercise at the end of January 2020, when the global development of the outbreak was still uncertain. Through collaboration with the Public Health Agency of Sweden and a civilian hospital, a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method specific to SARS-CoV-2 was made available and adapted to the mobile laboratory, and the team established and evaluated a functional and efficient diagnostic asset along with a logistical support chain. We also organized and evaluated mobile testing teams, and the method was later used in large-scale, national, cross-sectional COVID-19 surveys in several regions of Sweden. In this article, we focus on the challenges of overbridging the civil-military interface in this context and identifying lessons learned and added values to the response during the early pandemic. We propose that the experiences from this exercise and governmental agency collaboration are valuable in preparation for future outbreaks.","Bacchus, Philip; Nissen, Karolina; Berg, Johanna; Bråve, Andreas; Gyll, Jenny; Larsson, Christer; Muradrasoli, Shaman; Tellström, Andreas; Salaneck, Erik",Health Secur,548,24

Un estudio observacional,17.001448,-1.0819651,2021-08-09,"BACKGROUND: Interferon α (IFNα) is a cytokine whose production is increased endogenously in response to viral infection and in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). An elevated IFNα signature has been associated with clinically observed neuro-behavioural deficits such as mild cognitive impairment, fatigue, depression and psychosis in these diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying these neuropsychiatric symptoms remain largely unknown, and it is as yet unclear how IFNα signalling might influence central nervous system (CNS) function. Aberrant microglia-mediated synaptic pruning and function has recently been implicated in several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, but whether and how IFNα modulates these functions are not well defined. METHODS: Using a model of peripheral IFNα administration, we investigated gene expression changes due to IFNAR signalling in microglia. Bulk RNA sequencing on sorted microglia from wild type and microglia-specific Ifnar1 conditional knockout mice was performed to evaluate IFNα and IFNAR signalling-dependent changes in gene expression. Furthermore, the effects of IFNα on microglia morphology and synapse engulfment were assessed, via immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found that IFNα exposure through the periphery induces a unique gene signature in microglia that includes the expected upregulation of multiple interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), as well as the complement component C4b. We additionally characterized several IFNα-dependent changes in microglial phenotype, including expression of CD45 and CD68, cellular morphology and presynaptic engulfment, that reveal subtle brain region-specific differences. Finally, by specifically knocking down expression of IFNAR1 on microglia, we show that these changes are largely attributable to direct IFNAR signalling on microglia and not from indirect signalling effects through other CNS parenchymal cell types which are capable of IFNα-IFNAR signal transduction. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral IFNα induces unique genetic and phenotypic changes in microglia that are largely dependent on direct signalling through microglial IFNAR. The IFNα-induced upregulation of C4b could play important roles in the context of aberrant synaptic pruning in neuropsychiatric disease.

BACKGROUND: We previously reported a 38% decline in cardiac catheterization activations during the early phase of the COVID‐19 pandemic mitigation measures. This study extends our early observations using a larger sample of STEMI programs representative of different US regions with the inclusion of more contemporary data. METHODS: Data from 18 hospitals or healthcare systems in the US from January 2019 to April 2020 were collecting including number activations for STEMI, the number of activations leading to angiography and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), and average door to balloon (D2B) times. Two periods, January 2019–February 2020 and March–April 2020, were defined to represent periods before (BC) and after (AC) initiation of pandemic mitigation measures, respectively. A generalized estimating equations approach was used to estimate the change in response variables at AC from BC. RESULTS: Compared to BC, the AC period was characterized by a marked reduction in the number of activations for STEMI (29%, 95% CI:18–38, p < .001), number of activations leading to angiography (34%, 95% CI: 12–50, p = .005) and number of activations leading to PPCI (20%, 95% CI: 11–27, p < .001). A decline in STEMI activations drove the reductions in angiography and PPCI volumes. Relative to BC, the D2B times in the AC period increased on average by 20%, 95%CI (−0.2 to 44, p = .05).

However, most microarray assays are labour‐intensive and time‐consuming to perform. This study describes the development and initial evaluation of a multiplex reverse transcription (RT)‐PCR and novel accompanying automated electronic microarray assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of seven important viruses that affect swine (foot‐and‐mouth disease virus [FMDV], swine vesicular disease virus [SVDV], vesicular exanthema of swine virus [VESV], African swine fever virus [ASFV], classical swine fever virus [CSFV], porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus [PRRSV] and porcine circovirus type 2 [PCV2]). The novel electronic microarray assay utilizes a single, user‐friendly instrument that integrates and automates capture probe printing, hybridization, washing and reporting on a disposable electronic microarray cartridge with 400 features. This assay accurately detected and identified a total of 68 isolates of the seven targeted virus species including 23 samples of FMDV, representing all seven serotypes, and 10 CSFV strains, representing all three genotypes. The assay successfully detected viruses in clinical samples from the field, experimentally infected animals (as early as 1 day post‐infection (dpi) for FMDV and SVDV, 4 dpi for ASFV, 5 dpi for CSFV), as well as in biological material that were spiked with target viruses. The limit of detection was 10 copies/μl for ASFV, PCV2 and PRRSV, 100 copies/μl for SVDV, CSFV, VESV and 1,000 copies/μl for FMDV. The electronic microarray component had reduced analytical sensitivity for several of the target viruses when compared with the multiplex RT‐PCR. The integration of capture probe printing allows custom onsite array printing as needed, while electrophoretically driven hybridization generates results faster than conventional microarrays that rely on passive hybridization. With further refinement, this novel, rapid, highly automated microarray technology has potential applications in multipathogen surveillance of livestock diseases.","Erickson, A.; Fisher, M.; Furukawa‐Stoffer, T.; Ambagala, A.; Hodko, D.; Pasick, J.; King, D.

The Apple Watch can detect falls and alert caregivers and clinicians that help is needed; the device could also be used to objectively collect data on gait, fitness, and falls as part of clinical trials. However, little is known about the ease of use of this technology among older adult ED patients, a population at high risk of recurrent falls. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study—the Geriatric Acute and Post-Acute Fall Prevention Intervention (GAPcare) II—is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the Apple Watch Series 4 paired with the iPhone and our research app Rhode Island FitTest (RIFitTest) among older adult ED patients seeking care for falls. METHODS: We will conduct field-testing with older adult ED patients (n=25) who sustained a fall and their caregivers (n=5) to determine whether they can use the Apple Watch, iPhone, and app either (1) continuously or (2) periodically, with or without telephone assistance from the research staff, to assess gait, fitness, and/or falls over time. During the initial encounter, participants will receive training in the Apple Watch, iPhone, and our research app. They will receive an illustrated training manual and a number to call if they have questions about the research protocol or device usage. Participants will complete surveys and cognitive and motor assessments on the app during the study period. At the conclusion of the study, we will solicit participant feedback through semistructured interviews. Qualitative data will be summarized using framework matrix analyses. Sensor and survey response data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Recruitment began in December 2019 and was on pause from April 2020 until September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Study recruitment will continue until 30 participants are enrolled.

We show that expansionary promise gaps were sizeable (about 1.5–2.5% of GDP during an average fiscal expansion episode) and that initial and economic conditions matter in explaining their size. We also find that the more leftist a government is, the larger the expansionary promise gap. Governments facing weak opposition in the parliament and those more effective are characterized by smaller expansionary promise gaps. Regarding the importance of decentralization and the role played by subnational governments, the larger their capacity to influence national legislation and policy, the larger the promise gaps.","Jalles, João Tovar",Comp Econ Stud,548,26

Here we focus on statistical predictions of COVID-19 infections performed by fitting asymptotic distributions to actual data. By taking as a case-study the epidemic evolution of total COVID-19 infections in Chinese provinces and Italian regions, we find that predictions are characterized by large uncertainties at the early stages of the epidemic growth. Those uncertainties significantly reduce after the epidemics peak is reached. Differences in the uncertainty of the forecasts at a regional level can be used to highlight the delay in the spread of the virus. Our results warn that long term extrapolation of epidemics counts must be handled with extreme care as they crucially depend not only on the quality of data, but also on the stage of the epidemics, due to the intrinsically non-linear nature of the underlying dynamics. These results suggest that real-time epidemiological projections should include wide uncertainty ranges and urge for the needs of compiling high-quality datasets of infections counts, including asymptomatic patients.","Alberti, Tommaso; Faranda, Davide",Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul,548,27

BACKGROUND: The infection risk for COVID‐19 in an enclosed inpatient psychiatric ward is high due to living arrangements in the ward and the nature of the infectious disease. INTRODUCTION: This paper describes inpatient nurses’ experiences, challenges and strategies deployed at the institutional and national levels to contain the spread of infection. METHODS: Written feedback was collected to understand nurses’ responses and identify their uptake of changes in procedure following the COVID‐19 outbreak in the ward. FINDINGS: Nurses felt shocked, worried, isolated, expressed a lack of confidence, and experienced physical exhaustion. COVID‐19 specific challenges were highlighted in the delivery of safe and quality nursing care. Nurses were satisfied with the hospital policy and strategies implemented during the outbreak, acknowledging the importance of support from nursing leaders. DISCUSSION: Practical support and strong nursing leadership have been imperative in the battle against the COVID‐19 outbreak in the psychiatric hospital. Psychiatric nursing care was maintained with a modified management and treatment approach. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses' willingness to adjust to the reconfiguration of operations to accommodate changes has been crucial for the healthcare system to run effectively. Good practices and policies established during this crisis should be developed and established permanently in nursing practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICY: Prompt and effective contingency planning and policymaking at the national and institutional level, targeting human resource management and infection control, can introduce changes and alternative options for nursing care in a pandemic. CONCLUSION: With support from influential nursing leaders, strategies and policies are imperative in ensuring the successful management of COVID situations in an inpatient psychiatric setting.","Gao, Z.; Tan, F.

There is an urgent need for serological tests to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which could be used to assess the prevalence of infection, as well as ascertain individuals who may be protected from future infection. Current serological tests developed for SARS-CoV-2 rely on traditional technologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and lateral flow assays, which may lack scalability to meet the demand of hundreds of millions of antibody tests in the coming year. Herein, we present an alternative method of antibody testing that just depends on one protein reagent being added to patient serum/plasma or whole blood and a short five-minute assay time. A novel fusion protein was designed that binds red blood cells (RBC) via a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against the H antigen and displays the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the surface of RBCs. Upon mixing of the fusion protein, RBD-scFv with recovered COVID-19 patient serum and RBCs, we observed agglutination of RBCs, indicating the patient developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Given that the test uses methods routinely used in hospital clinical labs across the world, we anticipate the test can be rapidly deployed with only the protein reagent required at projected manufacturing cost at U.S. cents per test. We anticipate our agglutination assay may find extensive use in low-resource settings for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Kruse, Robert L.; Huang, Yuting; Smetana, Heather; Gehrie, Eric A.; Amukele, Tim K.; Tobian, Aaron A.R.; Mostafa, Heba H.; Wang, Zack Z.",bioRxiv,548,8

However, the physiological demands of singing and its intensity as a physical activity are not well understood. METHODS: We compared cardiorespiratory parameters while completing components of Singing for Lung Health sessions, with treadmill walking at differing speeds (2, 4 and 6 km/hour). RESULTS: Eight healthy adults were included, none of whom reported regular participation in formal singing activities. Singing induced acute physiological responses that were consistent with moderate intensity activity (metabolic equivalents: median 4.12, IQR 2.72–4.78), with oxygen consumption, heart rate and volume per breath above those seen walking at 4 km/hour. Minute ventilation was higher during singing (median 22.42 L/min, IQR 16.83–30.54) than at rest (11 L/min, 9–13), lower than 6 km/hour walking (30.35 L/min, 26.94–41.11), but not statistically different from 2 km/hour (18.77 L/min, 16.89–21.35) or 4 km/hour (23.27 L/min, 20.09–26.37) walking. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the acute metabolic demands of singing are comparable with walking at a moderately brisk pace, hence, physical effects may contribute to the health and well-being benefits attributed to singing participation. However, if physical training benefits result remains uncertain. Further research including different singing styles, singers and physical performance impacts when used as a training modality is encouraged.

We conducted a systematic review to identify the characteristics of people who purchase loot boxes with real money, focusing on the relationships (a) between loot boxes and gaming, (b) between loot boxes and gambling, and (c) between loot boxes and other variables. RECENT FINDINGS: Of the 201 studies examined for eligibility, we reviewed 20 studies that met the predefined criteria, which were extracted by searching electronic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Ovid, EBSCO, and Web of Science) and the reference lists of included studies, and that were published up to March 27, 2021. Overall, this review identified positive relationships among Internet gaming disorder–related symptoms, disordered gambling symptoms, and engagement with, or investment in, loot boxes. In addition to gaming and gambling, the relationships among some variables, such as mood, gender, physiological state, motivation, and loot box engagement, were examined. SUMMARY: The present review clarified relationships between loot box engagement, gaming, gambling, and other variables, such as mood, gender, physiological state, and motivation, and partially identified the characteristics of people who purchase loot boxes using real money. Specifically, those who spend more money in-game on loot boxes exhibit Internet gaming–related and/or disordered gambling symptoms and behaviors.

This substantially impeded the integration of innovative pandemic outbreak management tools. Innovative crisis management, such as cluster tracking, risk group testing, georeferencing, or the integration of wastewater surveillance recommended by the EU Commission, was made significantly more difficult. AIM: In this case study in Berchtesgadener Land, we present the integration of an area-wide georeferenced wastewater surveillance system that captured 95% of the entire population since November 2020. METHODOLOGY: Sampling occurred twice a week at nine municipal wastewater treatment plants and directly from the main sewer at three locations. Samples were pre-treated by centrifugation and subsequently analyzed by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting four specific genes of SARS-CoV‑2. RESULTS: The integration of an area-wide georeferenced wastewater surveillance system was successful. Wastewater occurrences are plotted for each municipality against cumulative infections over seven days per 100,000 inhabitants. Changes in the infection pattern in individual communities are noticeable ten days ahead of the official case numbers with a sensitivity of approximately 20 in 100,000 inhabitants. DISCUSSION: The integration of this innovative approach to provide a comprehensive overview of the situation by employing a digital dashboard and the use of an early warning system via quantitative wastewater surveillance resulted in very efficient, proactive management, which might serve as a blueprint for other municipalities in Germany.","Roßmann, Katalyn; Großmann, Gerd; Frangoulidis, Dimitrios; Clasen, Rüttger; Münch, Manuel; Hasenknopf, Manfred; Wurzbacher, Christian; Tiehm, Andreas; Stange, Claudia; Ho, Johannes; Woermann, Marion; Drewes, Jörg E.",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,548,0

We propose herein to evaluate the impact of implementing conservative management as an alternative approach to surgical appendectomy in the treatment of proven acute appendicitis during COVID19 pandemic. Methods Our study is a prospective multicenter study that includes a cohort of 160 patients admitted to the surgical departments in both Tawam Hospital and Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City, Abu Dhabi, UAE, for the period from February 2020 till July 2020. Results Our results showed that 56 of our patients (35%) were treated conservatively, while the other 104 (65%) underwent operative management. There was a significant decrease in length of hospital stay (LOS) (2.32 days) among the first group compared to the second (2.8 days). Also, short term follow-up showed that 90% of those patients did not require further operative intervention or developed any serious complications. Out of the 110 patients that were swapped for COVID19, nine (8.18%) were confirmed to be positive. Our protocol was to avoid surgical management for COVID19 positive patients unless indicated. This resulted in (8/9) of COVID19 positive patients to be treated conservatively. Follow up was achieved by using telemedicine-based follow-up with the aim of empowering social distancing and reducing risk of viral exposure to patients as well as the health care providers. In conclusion, our results showed that the implementation of conservative management in treating patients with acute appendicitis who were COVID19 positive is a safe and feasible approach that maybe essential in reducing viral transmission risks as well as avoiding operative risks on COVID19 positive patients.","Hashmi, Fatima Y.

The emerging disease spread rapidly, due to the movement of infectious persons to some other regions, which has been witnessed in case of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). So, the networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. Motivated by the recent empirical evidence on the dispersal of infected individuals among the patches, we present the epidemic model SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) in which the population is divided into patches which form a network and the patches are connected through mean-field diffusive coupling. The corresponding unstable epidemiology classes will be synchronized and achieve stable state when the patches are coupled. Apart from synchronization and stability, the coupled model enables a range of rhythmic processes such as birhythmicity and rhythmogenesis which have not been investigated in epidemiology. The stability of Disease Free Equilibrium (or Endemic Equilibrium) is attained through cessation of oscillation mechanism namely Oscillation Death (OD) and Amplitude Death (AD). Corresponding to identical and non-identical epidemiology classes of patches, the different steady states are obtained and its transition is taking place through Hopf and transcritical bifurcation.","Verma, Tina; Gupta, Arvind Kumar",Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul,548,28

With no effective treatments and with time needed to develop a vaccine, alternative approaches are being used to control this pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to identify topics, opinions, and recommendations about the COVID-19 pandemic discussed by medical professionals on the Twitter social medial platform. METHODS: Using a mixed methods approach blending the capabilities of social media analytics and qualitative analysis, we analyzed COVID-19–related tweets posted by medical professionals and examined their content. We used qualitative analysis to explore the collected data to identify relevant tweets and uncover important concepts about the pandemic using qualitative coding. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques and text analysis were used to identify topics and opinions. RESULTS: Data were collected from 119 medical professionals on Twitter about the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 10,096 English tweets were collected from the identified medical professionals between December 1, 2019 and April 1, 2020. We identified eight topics, namely actions and recommendations, fighting misinformation, information and knowledge, the health care system, symptoms and illness, immunity, testing, and infection and transmission. The tweets mainly focused on needed actions and recommendations (2827/10,096, 28%) to control the pandemic. Many tweets warned about misleading information (2019/10,096, 20%) that could lead to infection of more people with the virus. Other tweets discussed general knowledge and information (911/10,096, 9%) about the virus as well as concerns about the health care systems and workers (909/10,096, 9%). The remaining tweets discussed information about symptoms associated with COVID-19 (810/10,096, 8%), immunity (707/10,096, 7%), testing (605/10,096, 6%), and virus infection and transmission (503/10,096, 5%).

Contact tracing is made ineffective, however, by delays in testing, calling, and isolating. Even if delays are minimized, contact tracing can only prevent a fraction of onward transmissions from contacts. Without other measures in place, contact tracing alone is insufficient to prevent exponential growth in the number of cases. Even when used effectively with other measures, occasional bursts in call loads can overwhelm contact tracing systems and lead to a loss of control. We propose embracing approaches to COVID-19 control that broadly test individuals without symptoms, in whatever way is economically feasible, either with fast cheap tests that can be deployed widely, with pooled testing, or with screening of judiciously chosen groups of high-risk individuals. Only by ramping up testing of asymptomatic individuals can we avoid the inherent delays that limit the efficacy of contact tracing.","Tupper, P. F.; Otto, S.; Colijn, C.",,548,18

METHODS: Retrospective case series of 28 eyes of 28 patients who underwent combined pars plana glaucoma drainage device and pars plana vitrectomy between November 2016 and September 2019 at Massachusetts Eye and Ear. Main outcome measures were intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucoma medication burden, best corrected visual acuity, and complications. Statistical tests were performed with R and included Kaplan-Meier analyses, Wilcoxon paired signed-rank tests, and Fisher tests. RESULTS: Mean IOP decreased from 22.8 mmHg to 11.8 mmHg at 1.5 years (p = 0.002), and mean medication burden decreased from 4.3 to 2.1 at 1.5 years (p = 0.004). Both IOP and medication burden were significantly lower at all follow-up time points. The probability of achieving 5 < IOP ≤ 18 mmHg with at least 20% IOP reduction from preoperative levels was 86.4% at 1 year and 59.8% at 1.5 years. At their last visit, three eyes (10.7%) achieved complete success with IOP reduction as above without medications, and 14 eyes (50.0%) achieved qualified success with medications. Hypotony was observed in 1 eye (3.6%) prior to 3 months postoperatively and 0 eyes after 3 months. Visual acuity was unchanged or improved in 23 eyes (82.1%) at their last follow-up. Two patients had a visual acuity decrease of > 2 lines. Two eyes required subsequent pars plana vitrectomies for tube obstruction, and one eye had transient hypotony. CONCLUSIONS: The results of pars plana glaucoma drainage device and pars plana vitrectomy using one of the vitrectomy sclerotomy sites for tube placement are promising, resulting in significant IOP and medication-burden reductions through postoperative year 1.5 without additional risk of postoperative complications. Inserting glaucoma drainage devices into an existing vitrectomy sclerotomy site may potentially save surgical time by obviating the need to create another sclerotomy for tube placement and suture one of the vitrectomy ports.","Chang, Enchi Kristina; Gupta, Sanchay; Chachanidze, Marika; Miller, John B.; Chang, Ta Chen; Solá-Del Valle, David A.",BMC Ophthalmol,548,24

Often in these communities, there is a dependence on bushmeat for both food security and basic income. Despite the importance of bushmeat for households worldwide, the practice raises concern for transmission of zoonotic pathogens through hunting, food preparation, and consumption. In Uganda, harvest of wildlife is illegal, but bushmeat hunting, is commonplace. We interviewed 292 women who cook for their households and 180 self-identified hunters from 21 villages bordering Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda to gain insights into bushmeat preferences, opportunity for zoonotic pathogen transmission, and awareness of common wildlife-associated zoonoses. Both hunters and women who cook considered primates to be the most likely wildlife species to carry diseases humans can catch. Among common zoonotic pathogens, the greatest proportions of women who cook and hunters believed that pathogens causing stomach ache or diarrhea and monkeypox can be transmitted by wildlife. Neither women who cook nor hunters report being frequently injury during cooking, butchering, or hunting, and few report taking precautions while handling bushmeat. The majority of women who cook believe that hunters and dealers never or rarely disguise primate meat as another kind of meat in market, while the majority of hunters report that they usually disguise primate meat as another kind of meat. These data play a crucial role in our understanding of potential for exposure to and infection with zoonotic pathogens in the bushmeat trade.

Objective: To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a combination of online and face-to-face follow-up for preterm infants during the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore a follow-up pattern that can provide follow-up services while maximizing the protection of preterm infants and soothing the fear of their parents. Methods: Preterm infants (n = 35) whose first follow-up appointment was scheduled from February 1 to April 30, 2020, and preterm infants (n = 43) in the NICU follow-up group who were discharged from January 1, 2018, to January 31, 2020, who had a second or later routine follow-up appointment scheduled from February 1 to April 30, 2020, were enrolled. We provided a combination of online and face-to-face follow-up for preterm infants surveyed with the Wenjuanxing platform before and after the online follow-up and compared the first-time follow-up rate between the outbreak and the same period of the previous year. Results: Feeding and oral medicine and supplements were the most concerning problems of the parents of preterm infants. The anxiety level of the family was significantly decreased after online follow-up (P < 0.05). A total of 96.8% of parents were satisfied or very satisfied with online follow-up, and 95.2% of parents thought that online follow-up had answered all their questions. Only 35.5% of parents thought online follow-up could replace face-to-face follow-up.

The importance of mitochondria in inflammatory pathologies, besides providing energy, is associated with the release of mitochondrial damage products, such as mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA), which may perpetuate inflammation. In this review, we aimed to show the importance of mitochondria, as organelles that produce energy and intervene in multiple pathologies, focusing mainly in COVID-19 and using multiple molecular mechanisms that allow for the replication and maintenance of the viral genome, leading to the exacerbation and spread of the inflammatory response. The evidence suggests that mitochondria are implicated in the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which forms double-membrane vesicles and evades detection by the cell defense system. These mitochondrion-hijacking vesicles damage the integrity of the mitochondrion’s membrane, releasing mt-DNA into circulation and triggering the activation of innate immunity, which may contribute to an exacerbation of the pro-inflammatory state. Conclusions. While mitochondrial dysfunction in COVID-19 continues to be studied, the use of mt-DNA as an indicator of prognosis and severity is a potential area yet to be explored.","Valdés-Aguayo, José J.; Garza-Veloz, Idalia; Badillo-Almaráz, José I.; Bernal-Silva, Sofia; Martínez-Vázquez, Maria C.; Juárez-Alcalá, Vladimir; Vargas-Rodríguez, José R.; Gaeta-Velasco, María L.; González-Fuentes, Carolina; Ávila-Carrasco, Lorena; Martinez-Fierro, Margarita L.",Medicina (Kaunas),548,16
