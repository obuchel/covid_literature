10615,10615,10615,Double-Edged Spike: Are SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Tests Safe Right Now?,10.539429,10.525044,2020-04-23,"ABSTRACT. The presence of concomitant viral or bacterial infection was evaluated in 20 patients hospitalized for adenovirus infection of the middle or lower airways by using new serological methods for detection of both antigens and antibodies. Adenovirus infection was identified by measurement of antibodies with complement fixation test or by direct detection of viral antigen in nasopharyngeal aspirates. Mixed infection was present in 11 (55%) of the 20 patients. Viral coinfection was demonstrated in five (25%) and bacterial in nine (45%) patients. Bacterial coinfection was common, 67%, in children with an infection focus, pneumonia or acute otitis media, but rare, 13%, in those without it. Seroconversion to nontypable Haemophilus influenzae was indicated in six children; four of them were infants, four had pneumonia and three acute otitis media. Pneumococcal infection was indicated in two patients with pneumonia, both aged over two years. Chlamydia trachomatis was involved in one case. The results indicate that bacterial coinfection is common in respiratory adenovirus infection affecting lower airways, especially if pneumonia is present.","KORPPI, M.; LEINONEN, M.; MÄKELÄ, P.

This time-consuming procedure requires expensive equipment and a high level of skill. Electroporation of zygotes offers a simplified and more streamlined approach to transfect mammalian zygotes. There are a number of studies examining the parameters used in electroporation of mouse and rat zygotes. Here, we review the electroporation conditions, timing, and success rates that have been reported for mice and rats, in addition to the few reports about livestock zygotes, specifically pigs and cattle. The introduction of editing reagents at, or soon after, fertilization can help reduce the rate of mosaicism, the presence of two of more genotypes in the cells of an individual; as can the introduction of nuclease proteins rather than mRNA encoding nucleases. Mosaicism is particularly problematic in large livestock species with long generation intervals as it can take years to obtain non-mosaic, homozygous offspring through breeding. Gene knockouts accomplished via the non-homologous end joining pathway have been more widely reported and successfully accomplished using electroporation than have gene knock-ins. Delivering large DNA plasmids into the zygote is hindered by the zona pellucida (ZP), and the majority of gene knock-ins accomplished by electroporation have been using short single stranded DNA (ssDNA) repair templates, typically less than 1 kb. The most promising approach to deliver larger donor repair templates of up to 4.9 kb along with genome editing reagents into zygotes, without using cytoplasmic injection, is to use recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) in combination with electroporation. However, similar to other methods used to deliver clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR) genome-editing reagents, this approach is also associated with high levels of mosaicism. Recent developments complementing germline ablated individuals with edited germline-competent cells offer an approach to avoid mosaicism in the germline of genome edited founder lines. Even with electroporation-mediated delivery of genome editing reagents to mammalian zygotes, there remain additional chokepoints in the genome editing pipeline that currently hinder the scalable production of non-mosaic genome edited livestock.","Lin, Jason C.; Van Eenennaam, Alison L.",Front Genet,601,1

Infection control practices have the potential to greatly influence family centeredness and care providers, and hospital personnel must consider the potential impacts of isolation and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Approaching infection control with the perspective of FCC requires balancing patient safety and overall patient well-being. In this chapter, authors consider infection control and the benefits of FCC, family and sibling visitation, the use of playrooms, animals in healthcare settings including animal-assisted interventions, the potential adverse effects of infection control practices, and strategies to mitigate these impacts.","Darby, John; Falco, Carla",Healthcare-Associated Infections in Children,601,33

The aim of BioASQ is the promotion of systems and methods for highly precise biomedical information access. This is done through the organization of a series of challenges (shared tasks) on large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering, where different teams develop systems that compete on the same demanding benchmark datasets that represent the real information needs of biomedical experts. In order to facilitate this information finding process, the BioASQ challenge introduced two complementary tasks: (a) the automated indexing of large volumes of unlabelled data, primarily scientific articles, with biomedical concepts, (b) the processing of biomedical questions and the generation of comprehensible answers. Rewarding the most competitive systems that outperform the state of the art, BioASQ manages to push the research frontier towards ensuring that the biomedical experts will have direct access to valuable knowledge.","Krallinger, Martin; Krithara, Anastasia; Nentidis, Anastasios; Paliouras, Georgios; Villegas, Marta",Advances in Information Retrieval,601,20

Confinement and social distancing have certainly been the most impacting ones. Such condition highlighted that religions, usually taken as something private and transcendent, are actually very material, in the sense that they are made in contact with and through body practices. The interruption of rituals and gatherings for religious activities prompted new religious material forms, like the use of technology for virtual ceremonies and protection masks adorned with religious motifs, the main point of this paper. Masks with Christian and Afro-Brazilian religious motifs sold on the internet as well as the process of making masks for donation as an unexpected form of religious activity will be here investigated. The goal is to show that material forms are intrinsic to religion and when they are suppressed in a way, they come around in another, for people need materiality to make unreal, real. The use of Material Religion approaches to examine such object should reveal that the many changes in religion triggered by pandemic will have occurred not because of the ideas it may evoke but through the material changes it might have occasioned.","de Souza, Patrícia Rodrigues",Int J Lat Am Relig,601,20

The TIPI has been translated into several languages, but psychometric properties of the Norwegian version (N-TIPI) have not been systematically explored. Objectives: This study aimed to explore the psychometric properties of the N-TIPI, in terms of internal consistency and structural validity. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, responses on the N-TIPI were collected from 5,009 Norwegian master graduates. Descriptive statistics for the subscales and correlations between subscales were calculated. Internal consistency was assessed with inter-item correlations, Cronbach’s α and Spearman-Brown coefficients. Structural validity was explored with principal component analysis, parallel analysis, and visual scree plot inspection. Results for the N-TIPI were compared with those previously reported for the original TIPI as well as the German, French, Spanish, and Portuguese versions. Results: Compared with the original and non-English versions of TIPI, results for N-TIPI showed comparable subscale rank order of means, standard deviations, and pattern of correlations between subscales, as well as inter-item correlations and Cronbach’s α. The 10 N-TIPI items were adequately reduced to five components, theoretically corresponding with the FFM personality domains. Conclusion: The N-TIPI demonstrated acceptable internal consistency and satisfactory structural validity. Although further research is warranted, the instrument stands out as feasible when it is essential to minimize participants’ response burden in studies that aim to explore personality as one among several concepts or utilize personality traits as covariates.","Thørrisen, Mikkel Magnus; Sadeghi, Talieh; Wiers-Jenssen, Jannecke",Front Psychol,601,16

Co-morbid depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Depressive symptoms in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are associated with poorer survival, longer hospitalisation and impaired quality of life. Literature on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is largely derived from high-income countries; yet 90% of deaths related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease occur in low- and middle-income countries. We aimed to establish the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as the association with psychosocial outcomes. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients attending outpatient primary care clinics in Karachi, Pakistan. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to assess depression and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 scale was used for the assessment of anxiety. Health-related quality of life was assessed with EuroQol–Five Dimensions, social support with Oslo-3 and social stress with Life Events Checklist. We recruited 293 subjects. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression and anxiety in the sample was 51% (n = 149) and 20% (n = 59), respectively. Depressed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients reported significantly lower health-related quality of life scores as compared to non-depressed patients. Participants with depression had significantly higher levels of anxiety, less social support, higher social stress and more subjective impairment in quality of life. CONCLUSION: Given the association with reduced social support and increased perceived stress, the role of psychosocial interventions must be explored in improving outcomes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in Pakistan.","Husain, Muhammad Omair; Chaudhry, Imran B; Blakemore, Amy; Shakoor, Suleman; Husain, Muhammad Ali; Lane, Steven; Kiran, Tayyeba; Jafri, Farhat; Memon, Rakhshi; Panagioti, Maria; Husain, Nusrat",SAGE Open Med,601,16

However, heterogeneity in the definition of multimorbidity and design of epidemiological studies results in difficulty in comparing multimorbidity studies. This scoping review aimed to describe multimorbidity prevalence in studies using large datasets and report the differences in multimorbidity definition and study design. METHODS We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases to identify large epidemiological studies on multimorbidity. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) protocol for reporting the results. RESULTS Twenty articles were identified. We found two key definitions of multimorbidity: at least two (MM2+) or at least three (MM3+) chronic conditions. The prevalence of multimorbidity MM2+ ranged from 15.3% to 93.1%, and 11.8% to 89.7% in MM3+. The number of chronic conditions used by the articles ranged from 15 to 147, which were organized into 21 body system categories. There were seventeen cross-sectional studies and three retrospective cohort studies, and four diagnosis coding systems were used. CONCLUSIONS We found a wide range in reported prevalence, definition, and conduct of multimorbidity studies. Obtaining consensus in these areas will facilitate better understanding of the magnitude and epidemiology of multimorbidity.","Chua, Ying Pin; Xie, Ying; Lee, Poay Sian Sabrina; Lee, Eng Sing",International journal of environmental research and public health,601,19

METHOD A longitudinal study of 330 injured trauma survivors was conducted and participants were assessed during hospitalization, and at 1, 3, and 6 months follow-up. Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) was assessed during hospitalization using the Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASD-I), PTSD was measured at all follow-up with the Post-Traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS) and depression was measured at hospitalization with the (BSI) and at follow-up with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESDS). Covariates were explored, including coping self-efficacy, anger, education level, and mechanism of injury. RESULTS Four latent classes were identified for PTSD and Depression symptoms: chronic distress, delayed distress, recovered, and resilience. When compared to the resilient group, individuals with chronic distress were more likely to have been assaulted, had higher levels of anger, and had less coping self-efficacy. The delayed distress group had lower education levels, higher levels of coping self-efficacy, and higher levels of anger. Individuals in the recovered group had fewer years of education, and higher levels of anger. CONCLUSION The majority of the injured trauma sample demonstrated resiliency, with those exhibiting distress doing so as a delayed, chronic, or recovered trajectory. Coping self efficacy, education, assaultive trauma type, and anger were important covariates of depression and PTSD trajectories.

In the present study, the effect of lethal influenza on pulmonary and systemic coagulation activation and whether or not FVL mutation alters coagulation activation in and the course of lethal influenza, was determined. Wild-type mice, and mice heterozygous or homozygous for FVL were infected intranasally with a lethal dose of H1N1 (haemagglutinin 1 and neuraminidase 1) influenza A. Mice were sacrificed after 48 or 96 h for determination of coagulation activation, histopathology, pulmonary inflammatory parameters and viral load, or were observed in a survival study. Extensive local and systemic coagulation activation during lethal influenza was demonstrated by increased lung and plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes and fibrin degradation products, and by pulmonary fibrin deposition. FVL mutation did not influence the procoagulant response, lung histopathology or survival. FVL mice demonstrated elevated viral loads 48 h after infection.

The disease is caused by an overreaction of the innate immune system producing a cytokine storm and inflicting multiple organ damage. Our interpretation of IvIg therapy hinges on a recent analysis of the immune dysregulation in Covid-19 infection.(1) Previous infections with common cold coronavirus induce suppressor memory B cells that inhibit an immune response to Covid-19. The repertoire of natural antibodies (IvIg) contains suppressing antibodies in a symmetrically balanced network structure. When this repertoire interacts with the imbalanced network in the infected patient, it can neutralize the suppression of an antibody response against Covid-19. The described scenario for IvIg in Covid-19 infection may also apply in the therapy of autoimmune diseases.(2).","Kohler, Heinz; Kaveri, Srini",Monoclonal antibodies in immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy,601,7

Patients were randomized to treatment on presentation with any nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Because all other randomized trials comparing these 2 types of treatments have been limited to saccular aneurysms, the authors analyzed the current BRAT data for this subgroup of lesions. METHODS The primary BRAT analysis included all sources of SAH: nonaneurysmal lesions; saccular, blister, fusiform, and dissecting aneurysms; and SAHs from an aneurysm associated with either an arteriovenous malformation or a fistula. In this post hoc review, the outcomes for the subgroup of patients with saccular aneurysms were further analyzed by type of treatment. The extent of aneurysm obliteration was adjudicated by an independent neuroradiologist not involved in treatment. RESULTS Of the 471 patients enrolled in the BRAT, 362 (77%) had an SAH from a saccular aneurysm. Patients with saccular aneurysms were assigned equally to the clipping and the coiling cohorts (181 each). In each cohort, 3 patients died before treatment and 178 were treated. Of the 178 clip-assigned patients with saccular aneurysms, 1 (1%) was crossed over to coiling, and 64 (36%) of the 178 coil-assigned patients were crossed over to clipping. There was no statistically significant difference in poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score > 2) between these 2 treatment arms at any recorded time point during 6 years of follow-up. After the initial hospitalization, 1 of 241 (0.4%) clipped saccular aneurysms and 21 of 115 (18%) coiled saccular aneurysms required retreatment (p < 0.001). At the 6-year follow-up, 95% (95/100) of the clipped aneurysms were completely obliterated, compared with 40% (16/40) of the coiled aneurysms (p < 0.001). There was no difference in morbidity between the 2 treatment groups (p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS In the subgroup of patients with saccular aneurysms enrolled in the BRAT, there was no significant difference between modified Rankin Scale outcomes at any follow-up time in patients with saccular aneurysms assigned to clipping compared with those assigned to coiling (intent-to-treat analysis). At the 6-year follow-up evaluation, rates of retreatment and complete aneurysm obliteration significantly favored patients who underwent clipping compared with those who underwent coiling.

METHODS A series of 767 patients with gastric cancer who underwent R0 laparoscopic gastrectomy were retrospectively matched for age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiology score, body mass index, surgeon, lymph node dissection, and pathologic stages by propensity scoring. Finally, data from 274 patients (74 conventional laparoscopic distal gastrectomy [CLDG] cases, 74 reduced-port distal gastrectomy [RPDG] cases, 63 conventional laparoscopic total gastrectomy [CLTG] cases, and 63, reduced-port total gastrectomy [RPTG] cases) were selected for analysis. RESULTS Compared with the conventional group, the reduced-port group had significantly longer operation times (RPDG 265 min vs CLDG 239 min; p = 0.001 and RPTG 305 min vs CLTG 285 min; p = 0.012) and reduced blood loss (RPDG 48 ml vs CLDG 68 ml; p = 0.001 and RPTG 75 ml vs CLTG 110 ml; p = 0.026).

AR often co-occurs with asthma and conjunctivitis and is a global health problem causing major burden and disability worldwide. Risk factors include inhalant and occupational allergens, as well as genetic factors. AR impairs quality of life, affects social life, school and work, and is associated with substantial economic costs. The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) initiative classified AR into intermittent or persistent and mild or moderate/severe. The diagnosis is based on the clinical history and, if needed in patients with uncontrolled rhinitis despite medications or with long-lasting symptoms, on skin tests or the presence of serum-specific IgE antibodies to allergens. The most frequently used pharmacological treatments include oral, intranasal or ocular H1-antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids or a fixed combination of intranasal H1-antihistamines and corticosteroids. Allergen immunotherapy prescribed by a specialist using high-quality extracts in stratified patients is effective in patients with persistent symptoms. Real-world data obtained by mobile technology offer new insights into AR phenotypes and management. The outlook for AR includes a better understanding of novel multimorbid phenotypes, health technology assessment and patient-centred shared decision-making.","Bousquet, Jean; Anto, Josep M; Bachert, Claus; Baiardini, Ilaria; Bosnic-Anticevich, Sinthia; Walter Canonica, G; Melén, Erik; Palomares, Oscar; Scadding, Glenis K; Togias, Alkis; Toppila-Salmi, Sanna",Nature reviews.

METHODS This was a single-centered, retrospective, observational study. Patients of Sino-French Eco-City section of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China attended by Peking University Supporting Medical Team and admitted from Jan. 29, 2020 to Mar. 20, 2020 were included. The positive nucleic acid of COVID-19 virus and combination with hypertension, coronary heart disease or diabetes were in the standard. We collected the clinical data and laboratory examination results of the eligible patients to evaluate the related factors of death. RESULTS In the study, 94 COVID-19 patients enrolled were divided into the group of death (13 cases) and the group of survivors (81 cases), the average age was 66.7 years. Compared with the survival group, the death group had faster basal heart rate(103.2 beats/min vs. 88.4 beats /min, P=0.004), shortness of breath(29.0 beats /min vs. 20.0 beats /min, P<0.001), higher neutrophil count(9.2×109/L vs. 3.8×109/L, P<0.001), lower lymphocyte count(0.5×109/L vs. 1.1×109/L, P<0.001), creatine kinase MB(CK-MB, 3.2 μg/L vs. 0.8 μg/L, P<0.001), high sensitivity cardiac troponin Ⅰ(hs-cTnⅠ, 217.2 ng/L vs. 4.9 ng/L, P<0.001), N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide(NT-proBNP; 945.0 μg/L vs. 154.0 μg/L, P<0.001), inflammatory factor ferritin(770.2 μg/L vs. 622.8 μg/L , P=0.050), interleukin-2 recepter(IL-2R, 1 586.0 U/mL vs. 694.0 U/mL, P<0.001), interleukin-6(IL-6, 82.3 ng/L vs. 13.0 ng/L, P<0.001), interleukin-10(IL-10, 9.8 ng/L vs. 5.0 ng/L, P<0.001)were higher than those in the survival group. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for death were old age, low non oxygen saturation, low lymphocyte count, myocardial injury, abnormal increase of IL 2R, IL-6, and IL-10. Multivariate regression showed that old age (OR=1.11, 95%CI=1.03-1.19, P=0.026), low non oxygen saturation(OR=0.85, 95%CI=0.72-0.99, P=0.041), and abnormal increase of IL-10(＞9.1 ng/L, OR=101.93, 95%CI=4.74-2190.71, P=0.003)were independent risk factors for COVID-19 patients combined with hypertension, coronary heart disease or diabetes. CONCLUSION In COVID-19 patients combined with hypertension, coronary heart disease or diabetes, the risk factors for death were old age, low non oxygen saturation, low lymphocyte count, myocardial injury, and abnormal increase of IL-2R, IL-6, and IL-10. Old age, low non oxygen saturation and abnormal increase of IL-10 were independent risk factors.","Yang, H; Yang, L C; Zhang, R T; Ling, Y P; Ge, Q G",Beijing da xue xue bao.

Accordingly, it is necessary to identify the risk factors for death in patients with cancer and COVID-19. METHODS PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase Ovid databases were searched for relevant articles published before July 31st, 2020. Studies that explored the risk factors for mortality were included. The effect size was relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS We included 17 observational studies involving 3268 patients. The pooled mortality was 24.8%. Male gender, age above 65 years, and comorbidities (especially hypertension and COPD) were risk factors for death (RR 1.16, 1.27, 1.12; 95% CI 0.7-1.95, 1.08-1.49, 1.04-1.2; P=0.006, 0.004 and 0.002, respectively). Recent anti-cancer treatments did not increase mortality (P> 0.05). Dyspnea, cough, and sputum were associated with an elevated risk of death (P< 0.05). Antibiotics, glucocorticoids, interferons, invasive ventilation, and complications were associated with a high probability of death (P< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Various demographic and clinical characteristics, such as male gender, advanced age, comorbidities, and symptoms, were identified as risk factors for mortality in patients with cancer and COVID-19. Our findings suggest recent anti-cancer treatments do not increase mortality.

Following its first detection in the United States in February 2014, additional PDCoV strains have been identified in the United States and Canada. Currently, no treatments or vaccines for PDCoV are available. In this study, U.S. PDCoV strain OH-FD22 from intestinal contents of a diarrheic pig from Ohio was isolated in swine testicular (ST) and LLC porcine kidney (LLC-PK) cell cultures by using various medium additives. We also isolated PDCoV [OH-FD22(DC44) strain] in LLC-PK cells from intestinal contents of PDCoV OH-FD22 strain-inoculated gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs. Cell culture isolation and propagation were optimized, and the isolates were serially propagated in cell culture for >20 passages. The full-length S and N genes were sequenced to study PDCoV genetic changes after passage in Gn pigs and cell culture (passage 11 [P11] and P20). Genetically, the S and N genes of the PDCoV isolates were relatively stable during the first 20 passages in cell culture, with only 5 nucleotide changes, each corresponding to an amino acid change. The S and N genes of our sequenced strains were genetically closely related to each other and to other U.S. PDCoV strains, with the highest sequence similarity to South Korean strain KNU14-04. This is the first report describing cell culture isolation, serial propagation, and biological and genetic characterization of cell-adapted PDCoV strains.

For budded virions of the baculovirus Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus, the envelope glycoprotein GP64 is involved in host cell receptor binding, and GP64 is sufficient to mediate low-pH-triggered membrane fusion. To better define the role of GP64 in receptor binding, we generated and characterized a panel of antisera against subdomains of GP64. Eight subdomain-specific antisera were generated, and their reactivities with GP64 proteins and neutralization of virus infectivity and binding were examined. Antibodies directed against the N-terminal region of GP64 (amino acids 21 to 159) showed strong neutralization of infectivity and effectively inhibited binding of (35)S-labeled budded virions to Sf9 cells. In addition, we generated virions displaying truncated GP64 constructs. A construct displaying the N-terminal 274 amino acids (residues 21 to 294) of the ectodomain was sufficient to mediate virion binding. Additional studies of antisera directed against small subdomains revealed that an antiserum against a 40-amino-acid region (residues 121 to 160) neutralized virus infectivity. Site-directed mutagenesis was subsequently used for functional analysis of that region. Recombinant viruses expressing GP64 proteins with single amino acid substitutions within amino acids 120 to 124 and 142 to 148 replicated to high titers, suggesting that those amino acids were not critical for receptor binding or other important GP64 functions. In contrast, GP64 proteins with single amino acid substitutions of residues 153 and 156 were unable to substitute for wild-type GP64 and did not rescue a gp64 knockout virus. Further analysis showed that these substitutions substantially reduced binding of recombinant virus to Sf9 cells. Thus, the amino acid region from positions 21 to 159 was identified as a putative receptor binding domain, and amino acids 153 and 156 appear to be important for receptor binding.","Zhou, Jian; Blissard, Gary W",Journal of virology,601,7

Amongst the emerging neurologic complications is sensorineural hearing loss. While several cases of hearing loss amongst COVID-19 patients have been reported, the management of these patients has yet to be discussed and determined. Herein we present cochlear implant outcomes for a patient who suffered from unilateral sensorineural hearing loss after a prolonged hospital course for COVID-19. METHODS A patient who was hospitalized for COVID-19 for one month and subsequently developed unilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss underwent cochlear implantation for single-sided deafness. His COVID-19 hospital course was reviewed in detail. Speech perception and audiometric assessments were used to evaluate cochlear implant outcomes. RESULTS After cochlear implantation, the patient demonstrated improved speech perception on the implanted side and decreased tinnitus within 1 month of activation. CONCLUSIONS Cochlear implantation may be an appropriate intervention for patients who suffer from severe sensorineural hearing loss following infection with COVID-19.","Asfour, Leena; Kay-Rivest, Emily; Roland, J Thomas",Cochlear implants international,601,24

Localizing theses nodules by electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) techniques has not been well studied. METHODS A review of our thoracic surgery database was performed for patients undergoing ENB localization of pulmonary nodules for robotic resection between August 2012 and April 2013. RESULTS 19 patients were identified who underwent a combined localization with ENB and then da Vinci robotic lung resection. A transbronchial needle biopsy was performed in 14 patients followed by methylene blue dye marking on the pleural surface to localize the lesion. Five patients did not have a needle biopsy and underwent dye marking only. After dye marking, patients underwent robotic resection. Three patients who underwent transbronchial needle biopsy were found to have a diagnosis of malignancy and no diagnostic resection was needed. We proceeded directly to anatomic resection. Four patients had lesions too deep for a wedge resection, and a diagnostic segmentectomy was needed. The remaining 11 patients required a diagnostic wedge resection. The median time for the ENB portion of the procedure was 28 minutes. No adverse events were related to the placement of the dye marker, and no patients underwent conversion to an open procedure to localize the lesion. CONCLUSIONS We found ENB to be a safe and effective technique for localization of small pulmonary nodules with the diagnostic needle biopsy, possibly altogether negating the need for a wedge resection without adding significant time to the procedure.","Bolton, William D; Howe, Harold; Stephenson, James E",The Annals of thoracic surgery,601,16

Here we report the midterm results of a microsurgical non-patch technique and compare these findings to those in the literature. METHODS From 1998 to 2009 we treated 586 consecutive patients with CEA. CEA was performed, under general anesthesia, with a surgical microscope using a non-patch technique. Somatosensory evoked potential and transcranial Doppler were continuously monitored. Cross-clamping was performed under EEG burst suppression and adaptive blood pressure increase. Follow-up was performed by an independent neurologist. Mortality at 30 days and morbidity such as major and minor stroke, peripheral nerve palsy, hematoma and cardiac complications were recorded. The restenosis rate was assessed using duplex sonography 1 year after surgery. RESULTS A total of 439 (75%) patients had symptomatic and 147 (25%) asymptomatic stenosis; 49.7% of the stenoses were on the right-side. Major perioperative strokes occurred in five (0.9%) patients [n = 4 (0.9%) symptomatic; n = 1 (0.7%) asymptomatic patients]. Minor stroke was recorded in six (1%) patients [n = 4 (0.9%) symptomatic; n = 2 (1.3%) asymptomatic patients]. Two patients with symptomatic stenoses died within 1 month after surgery. Nine patients (1.5%) had reversible peripheral nerve palsies, and nine patients (1.5%) suffered a perioperative myocardial infarction. High-grade (>70%) restenosis at 1 year was observed in 19 (3.2%) patients [n = 12 (2.7%) symptomatic; n = 7 (4.7%) asymptomatic patients].

A comprehensive systematic literature review and meta-analysis was therefore undertaken, pooling data on preference-based health state utilities by weight status in children using a random-effects model. Tests for heterogeneity were performed, and publication bias was assessed. Of 3,434 potentially relevant studies identified, 11 met our eligibility criteria. Estimates of Cohen's d statistic suggested a small effect of weight status on preference-based utilities. Mean utility values were estimated as 0.85 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0.84-0.87), 0.83 (95% UI 0.81-0.85), 0.82 (95% UI 0.79-0.84) and 0.83 (95% UI 0.80-0.86) for healthy weight, overweight, obese and overweight/obese states, respectively. Meta-analysis of studies reporting utility values for both healthy weight and overweight/obese participants found a statistically significant weighted mean difference (0.015, 95% UI 0.003-0.026). A small but statistically significant difference was also estimated between healthy weight and overweight participants (0.011, 95% UI 0.004-0.018).

Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), a class of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARD), are effective at treating symptoms and inhibiting joint progression. Although treatment changes are not recommended in patients with stable disease, health plans have recently enacted formulary changes with higher copayments that could disrupt patient access to TNFis. OBJECTIVE To assess the association of formulary copayment changes with real-world treatment patterns, treatment effectiveness, and health care costs among bDMARD-naive patients with RA receiving the TNFi etanercept. METHODS This retrospective observational cohort analysis used the IBM Watson Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database. Adult patients with RA with 6 months of stable etanercept use (no refill gap ≥ 45 days) from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015, were selected and the index date was set to the first fill date after the stable-use period. Average etanercept copayment was calculated at the drug-plan level. Copayment change was defined as a monthly increase of at least $40 to account for copayment changes attributable to etanercept wholesale acquisition costs between 2014 and 2015. This amount also corresponded to the 90th percentile of average plan-level changes in etanercept copayments in the database, representing an average change in copayment by a payer. Patients were followed ≥ 12 months before and after the index date to track etanercept treatment changes and ≥ 12 months after a treatment change to track costs after etanercept copayment changes. Etanercept persistence, bDMARD switching, refill gaps, and treatment effectiveness (using a validated effectiveness algorithm) were described for patients with or without copayment change during the 12 months post-index or postchange. We also assessed the mean total of all-cause and RA-related expenditure during the 12-month post-index (or postchange) period. RESULTS 1,970 stable patients met study inclusion criteria (mean [standard deviation] age: 50.3 [9.5] years; 77.8% female) and were evaluated. Of these, 133 (6.8%) patients had a copayment change ≥$40 during follow-up. Overall, most patients (60.3%) persisted on etanercept for the 12-month follow-up period, while 13.0% switched from etanercept, and 8.1% discontinued (refill gap of ≥ 45 days). Nearly half (48.0%) of all patients were considered effectively treated according to a validated algorithm. Compared with patients without a copayment change, those with a copayment change were more likely to switch biologics (19.5% vs. 12.6%; P = 0.021). Although statistical significance was not reached, patients with a copayment change were less likely to be persistent (54.1% vs. 60.7%; P = 0.135), and less likely to be effectively treated (42.1% vs. 48.4%; P = 0.161) than patients without a copayment change. All-cause and RA-related expenditures at baseline and post-copayment change were similar between patients with and without a copayment change. CONCLUSIONS Changing formulary copayment of etanercept was associated with higher switching without difference in costs or health care utilization between copayment and no copayment change groups.

As with the financial slump of 2008, however, such notions have proved almost ridiculously optimistic as it has been capital, through its near symbiosis with the state, that has been best able to respond, with the English government-the devolved nations adopted a markedly different approach-taking every opportunity to ensure the pandemic has proved a bonanza for private-sector healthcare interests. However, this has not just been about individual contracts in, for example, test and trace, vaccination, or personal protective equipment; the crisis has been used to both rescue the private acute market following 2 years of contracted revenues and to provide enormous stimulus for its future growth. This has required the support of several organizations acting in concert, including the NHS Confederation and the Royal Colleges. While the pandemic has served to illuminate such relationships, the author also argues that the oft-recurring governmental praise of the NHS needs to be matched by genuine investment in public hospitals.","Player, Stewart D","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",601,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Considering the working environment of medical staff in forefront of NCP, we designed and recorded MBSR audio album including 13 sessions, covering 24 hours of a day, then sent the album to medical staff who had been working in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. We collected the playback amount in each session on February 10th and February 24th, which were one week and three weeks after the album was finished. RESULTS On February 10th and February 24th, there were separately 5778 and 10640 times of broadcasting. The highest broadcasting frequency session was at 5:00 am, followed by 7:00 am. The least broadcasting frequency sessions were 17:00 pm and 19:00 pm. The broadcasting amount in the 6 periods of the night (from 21:00 pm to 7:00 am) was significantly higher than those in the daytime (from 9:00 am to 19:00 pm), with a statistical difference. The tendency of the amount of playback was consistent, which was not affected by the specific content of the mindfulness exercises. CONCLUSIONS Online MBSR exercises were well accepted by medical staff in the COVID-19. It may help them relax and reduce the risk of stress reactions. During the NCP, medical staff may have different degrees of sleep and emotional problems, which need to be paid more attention to.","Liu, Y; Luo, S-X; Ye, J-L; Chen, Y-Z; Li, J-F; Li, Y-X",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,601,1

OBJECTIVES To understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mothers/parents across Nova Scotia who are caring for a child 0-12 months of age. DESIGN This study utilized an online qualitative survey to collect data. Feminist poststructuralism and discourse analysis guided the analysis and discussion. SETTING Nova Scotia, Canada PARTICIPANTS: : 68 participants were recruited from across the province of Nova Scotia. FINDINGS Mental health and socialization were both major concerns for new mothers/parents, as many expressed feelings of worry, anxiety, loneliness, isolation, and stress. KEY CONCLUSIONS Online support was sought by many new mothers/parents as a way of supporting their own mental health. Some found ways to make it meaningful for them, while others believed that it could not replace or offer the same benefits as in-person interaction and support. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Informal and formal support systems are both essential for new mothers. As public health systems and health care services learn to adapt to COVID-19, further research is required to examine how health services may best meet the needs of new mothers/parents.","Ollivier, Rachel; Aston, Dr Megan; Price, Dr Sheri; Sim, Dr Meaghan; Benoit, Dr Britney; Joy, Dr Phillip; Iduye, Damilola; Nassaji, Neda Akbari",Midwifery,601,16

This type of retrospective visual analysis, however, is prone to a variety of selection bias effects, especially for high-dimensional data where only a subset of dimensions is visualized at any given time. The risk of selection bias is even higher when analysts dynamically apply filters or perform grouping operations during ad hoc analyses. These bias effects threaten the validity and generalizability of insights discovered during visual analysis as the basis for decision making. Past work has focused on bias transparency, helping users understand when selection bias may have occurred. However, countering the effects of selection bias via bias mitigation is typically left for the user to accomplish as a separate process. Dynamic reweighting (DR) is a novel computational approach to selection bias mitigation that helps users craft bias-corrected visualizations. This paper describes the DR workflow, introduces key DR visualization designs, and presents statistical methods that support the DR process. Use cases from the medical domain, as well as findings from domain expert user interviews, are also reported.","Borland, David; Zhang, Jonathan; Kaul, Smiti; Gotz, David",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,601,31

AIM To describe our technique of pure laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (PLPD) with the AFA, and to report the surgical outcomes of this procedure in a small series of 12 patients through a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twelve selected patients underwent elective full laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy with the AFA. The technical aspects of the procedure are described in detail and the included images facilitate the understanding of the procedure. RESULTS The mean operative time was 300 min (range: 250-540 min). No intraoperative complications were observed. No conversion to laparotomy was necessary. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 18 days (range: 8-42). Mortality was null. There were 3 major complications at the 3rd post-operative month follow-up: 2 patients reporting a grade A pancreatic fistula and one biliary fistula. CONCLUSIONS Our work shows that pure laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (PLPD) with the AFA is feasible, in selected patients. The AFA could improve on the advantages of laparoscopy in the identification of unresectable patients, and it also allows early control of vascular structures.","Azagra, Juan Santiago; Arru, Luca; Estévez, Sergio; Silviu-Tiberiu, Makkai-Popa; Poulain, Virginie; Goergen, Martine",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,601,26

Recent technological achievements and their overuse led falsely to underestimation of its significance, which has been further questioned during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to concerns regarding exposure risk and use of personal protective equipment. AREAS COVERED The role of clinical examination (namely chest examination) during the pandemic is discussed. Emerging evidence is being accumulated concerning alternatives to traditional practices. Telemedicine stands out as a promising tool, allowing inspection and interaction between physicians and patients, proved to be useful for many medical specialties but not enough for some others. Medical practices cannot remain the same in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet realistic strategies should be adopted for their optimal and safe implementation. EXPERT OPINION The experience of a dedicated Reference Center for COVID-19 along with a suggested algorithm for conducting clinical examination are presented. According to our experience, an initial detailed clinical examination upon admission of each COVID-19 patient appears to be necessary. Then, vital signs and signs of respiratory distress using inspection should be checked frequently. A focused examination approach should be adopted, in case of new onset clinical problems.","Kyriakoulis, Konstantinos G; Poulakou, Garyphallia; Nitsotolis, Thomas; Syrigos, Konstantinos N",Expert review of respiratory medicine,601,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study encompassed 91 recessions in 29 patients for whom MCAT was combined with CM on one side of the mandible and SCTG on the contralateral one. The following clinical parameters were measured: gingival recession height (GR) and width (RW), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), width of keratinized tissue (KT), gingival thickness (GT), mean (MRC) and complete root coverage (CRC) and Root Coverage Esthetic Score (RES). RESULTS The MRC proportions on the CM- and SCTG-treated sides were 53.20% and 83.10%, respectively. CRC was achieved in 9 out of 45 (20%) gingival defects treated with CM and 31 out of 46 (67%) treated with SCTG. There were statistically significant differences in MRC, CRC, GR, RW, KT, GT and RES between CM- and CTG-treated sides. CONCLUSIONS Modified coronally advanced tunnel technique leads to reduction in gingival recession both when combined CM and SCTG, of which the latter is more efficient as far as root coverage and aesthetic parameters are concerned.","Pietruska, Małgorzata; Skurska, Anna; Podlewski, Łukasz; Milewski, Robert; Pietruski, Jan",Journal of clinical periodontology,601,16

Bacteriophage therapy has experienced resurgence to compensate for the limited development of novel antibiotics. However, phage therapy is limited to a compassionate use so far, resulting from lack of adequate studies in relevant pharmacological models. We used a pig model of pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa that recapitulates essential features of human disease to study the antimicrobial efficacy of nebulized-phage therapy. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH (i) Lysis kinetic assays were performed to evaluate in vitro phage antibacterial efficacy against P. aeruginosa and select relevant combinations of lytic phages. (ii) The efficacy of the phage combinations was investigated in vivo (murine model of P. aeruginosa lung infection). (iii) We determined the optimal conditions to ensure efficient phage delivery by aerosol during mechanical ventilation. (iv) Lung antimicrobial efficacy of inhaled-phage therapy was evaluated in pigs, which were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated and infected with P. aeruginosa. KEY RESULTS By selecting an active phage cocktail and optimizing aerosol delivery conditions, we were able to deliver high phage concentrations in the lungs, which resulted in a rapid and marked reduction in P. aeruginosa density (1.5 Log reduction, p<0.001). No infective phage was detected in the sera and urines throughout the experiment. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings demonstrated: (i) the feasibility of delivering large amounts of active phages by nebulization during mechanical ventilation, (ii) rapid control of in situ infection by inhaled bacteriophage in an experimental model of P. aeruginosa pneumonia with high translational value.","Guillon, Antoine; Pardessus, Jeoffrey; L'Hostis, Guillaume; Fevre, Cindy; Barc, Celine; Dalloneau, Emilie; Jouan, Youenn; Bodier-Montagutelli, Elsa; Perez, Yonatan; Thorey, Camille; Mereghetti, Laurent; Cabrera, Maria; Riou, Mickaël; Vecellio, Laurent; Le Guellec, Sandrine; Heuzé-Vourc'h, Nathalie",British journal of pharmacology,601,5

Mechanisms transforming of HCV infection into lymphoproliferative and/or autoimmune disorders are still poorly understood. In course of HCV infection, the sustained virus-driven antigenic stimulation may probably induce a B-cell clonal expansion. Measurements of serum free light chains (FLCs) levels, considered as a direct marker of B cell activity, are analyzed with increasing interest in clinical practice, for diagnosis, monitoring and follow-up of plasma cell dyscrasia. Syndecan-1 (CD138) is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed and actively shed by most myeloma cells. Membrane CD138 represents the major receptor protein for HCV attachment to the hepatocyte surface and high levels of circulating sCD138 levels are detected in patients at early stage of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This study is aimed to evaluate sCD138 and FLC levels as diagnostic biomarkers of HCV-related MC with B-NHL. PATIENTS AND METHODS We enrolled 35 HCV-MC-NHL patients, characterized for the specific type of cryoglobulins, and 25 healthy blood donors (HBD) as negative control. Serum sCD138 levels were determined using ELISA kits specific for human sCD138. Serum FLCs were assessed by means of the turbidimetric assay. RESULTS We found that serum levels of sCD138, as well as FLCs, were significantly higher in patients than in HBD (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS In agreement with the definition of HCV-driven lymphoproliferative disorders as the consequence of a multifactorial and multistep pathogenetic process, we suggest that sCD138 and FLCs could be considered putative independent markers of worsening progression of the disease.","Gulli, F; Marino, M; Napodano, C; Pocino, K; Pandolfi, F; Gasbarrini, A; Rapaccini, G L; Basile, U",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,601,16

This study surveyed 211 forensic practitioners from the American Academy of Forensic Sciences membership, the Clark County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner, and the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner to assess current wellness perceptions within forensics. The 22-question survey focused on (a) how the demands of daily casework affect self-perceived burnout levels, (b) whether mental health issues are adequately addressed during the education and training of the forensic workforce, and (c) whether forensic professionals are getting the wellness support that they themselves feel that they need. Basic descriptive statistics, chi-square (χ2 ) cross tabulations, and correlation analyses were constructed to assess relevant relationships within survey responses. Results indicate that forensic professionals report a high level of burnout and a lack of sufficient wellness resources in their current professional climate. While professionals feel fulfilled from their work, the majority of respondents (73.9%) felt that common mental health issues that exist in their profession were not adequately addressed during their workplace training, academic schooling, or professional certification. Despite the uniformly weak correlations observed between variables, chi-square analyses reveal practically and statistically significant trends that warrant further investigation, particularly in the context of vicarious trauma. Overall, this study provides an important baseline for future wellness research to support the specialized needs of forensic scientists during their training and education.","Goldstein, Justin Z; Alesbury, Helen S",Journal of forensic sciences,601,24

GOALS To identify prognostic factors including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for overall survival and intrahepatic recurrence after RFA. PATIENTS AND METHODS Not only naïve but also previously treated patients with solitary hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma <5 cm were prospectively enrolled and a ≥50% decrease from baseline to 1 month after RFA was defined as an initial AFP response. Tumor responses were assessed by the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. RESULTS Among 255 patients, 156 patients (61.2%) developed intrahepatic recurrence. Radiologic progression occurred in 54.8% (86/157) in the AFP responders and 71.4% (70/98) in the AFP nonresponders. In multivariate analysis, a history of previous treatment [hazard ratio (HR), 2.037; P=0.015 for percutaneous ethanol injection vs. none; and HR, 2.642; P<0.001 for transarterial chemoembolization vs. none] and an initial AFP nonresponse (HR, 1.899; P<0.001) were independent predictors of accelerated progression after RFA. Moreover, those who had a history of previous treatment and did not achieve an initial AFP response had significantly unfavorable overall survival (HR, 3.581; P<0.001) and the increased risk of intrahepatic remote recurrence (HR, 5.385; P<0.001) compared with those with an initial AFP response and no history of previous treatment. CONCLUSIONS Biological response evaluation by the measurement of serial AFP levels is a useful predictor of overall survival and intrahepatic remote recurrence after RFA. Therefore, an initial AFP response may aid in determining the need of closer follow-up as a therapeutic response indicator of RFA.","Yu, Su Jong; Kwon, Jee Hye; Kim, Won; Yoon, Jung-Hwan; Lee, Jeong Min; Lee, Jae Young; Cho, Eun Ju; Lee, Jeong-Hoon; Kim, Hwi Young; Jung, Yong Jin; Kim, Yoon Jun",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,601,19

However, this device is barely visible using conventional DSA; thus, high-resolution contrast-enhanced flat panel detector CT (VasoCT) may be useful before detachment to assess the sizing and positioning of the WEB. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interest of VasoCT during WEB procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS From March 2012 to July 2013, twelve patients (10 women and 2 men; age range, 44-55 years) were treated for 13 intracranial aneurysms with the WEB device. DSA and VasoCT were used and compared to depict any protrusion of the device in parent arteries before detachment. Two neuroradiologists reviewed each VasoCT scan, and the quality was graded on a subjective quality scale. RESULTS The mesh of the WEB was very well-depicted in all cases, allowing a very good assessment of its deployment. Device protrusion was clearly detected with VasoCT in 5 cases, leading to WEB repositioning or size substitution. During follow-up, VasoCT also allows good assessment of eventual residual blood flow inside the aneurysm or the WEB device. CONCLUSIONS Unlike DSA, VasoCT is an excellent tool to assess WEB deployment and positioning. In our experience, it allowed a precise evaluation of the WEB sizing and its relation to the parent vessel. Such information very likely enhances the ability to safely use this device, avoiding potential thromboembolic events in cases of protrusion in the parent arteries.","Caroff, J; Mihalea, C; Neki, H; Ruijters, D; Ikka, L; Benachour, N; Moret, J; Spelle, L",AJNR.

Purpose The present study aimed to determine the influence of preoperative nutritional status on the postoperative outcomes of pediatric patients who underwent elective gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. Methods This prospective observational study was conducted at Cairo University Specialized Pediatric Hospital. According to the designated inclusion criteria, 75 surgical cases of both sexes were included. A structured questionnaire was developed and administered. This questionnaire included three main sections: demographic data and nutritional status parameters at admission and discharge. Pre- and postoperative nutritional statuses were compared. Results According to both the Subjective Global Nutritional Assessment and STRONGKIDS score Questioner, more than 60% of patients in the upper GI patient group were at risk of malnutrition. Wasting status was most common in the upper GI patient group (67%; versus 39.1% in the lower GI group). Underweight status was more common in the hepatobiliary and upper GI patient groups (nearly 50% for each group) than in the lower GI group (30.4%). On the other hand, stunted patients had a higher incidence of complications and a prolonged hospital stay (P = 0.003 and P = 0.037, respectively), while underweight lower GI patients experienced a prolonged hospital stay (P = 0.02). A higher proportion of patients with preoperative anemia than those without preoperative anemia required a blood transfusion (P = 0.003). Conclusion Nutritional assessment is a crucial component of pediatric surgical patient management. Both underweight and wasting statuses were more common among hepatobiliary and upper GI patients. Postoperative complications and a long hospital stay were more common among stunted patients.","El Koofy, Nehal; Nasr Eldin, Hadeer Mohamed; Mohamed, Wesam; Gad, Mostafa; Tarek, Sara; El Tagy, Gamal",Clinical and experimental pediatrics,601,16

Treatment improvement criteria for each lesion included the texture of the lesion, severity of the pigmentation, and an overall assessment of the healing. The severity of burning, pain, erythema, and the duration of the erythema after the procedures were documented. A survey of the patients' satisfaction with the treatments was also performed. RESULTS In the assessment of overall lesion healing by two dermatologists, the improvement rate was significantly higher in the CO2, Er:YAG lasers and electrodesiccation group compared to the cryotherapy (p <0.001). However, the CO2 and Er:YAG laser and the electrodesiccation groups showed no significant difference (p> 0.05). Moreover, no significant difference was observed in post-treatment pigmentation and texture between the groups (p> 0.05). The pain and burning severity after the interventions were negligible in all four groups. Prolonged erythema was not observed in any of the cases; however, the duration of erythema in the Er:YAG laser group was significantly longer (p <0.001). Patient satisfaction in the cryotherapy group was significantly lower than the other three groups (p <0.001). CONCLUSION The efficacy of treatment and patient satisfaction rate is highly comparable between electrodesiccation, CO2 laser, and Er:YAG laser but significantly higher than cryotherapy.

METHODS A retrospective observational cohort study was performed on children diagnosed with leukodystrophies in Peking University First Hospital from January 2004 to June 2019, and the patients were followed for 5.5 years (0.4-14.2 years) after the first visit. RESULTS A total of 333 patients were included. The overall incidence of epilepsy was 30.6% (102/333). Alexander disease had the highest incidence (77.3%, 51/66), followed by vanishing white matter disease (41.2%, 21/51), Canavan disease (33.3%, 1/3), megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (32.1%, 9/28), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (23.1%, 3/13), Krabbe disease (18.8%, 3/16), metachromatic leukodystrophy (14.3%, 6/42), and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (7.0%, 8/114). The incidence of epilepsy in leukodystrophies classified as astrocytopathies was higher than that in myelin disorders (55.9% vs. 11.2%, P < 0.001). Of the 102 patients with epilepsy, seizures were the chief complaint in 61.8% (63/102) and the initial symptom in 22.5% (23/102). The median age at seizure onset was 20.5 months (1 day-176 months). A total of 63.7% (65/102) of children were treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and the responder rate was 90.8% (59/65) at the last follow-up, including 71.2% (42/59) of children who were seizure free. CONCLUSIONS Epilepsy was not uncommon in children with leukodystrophies. Children with Alexander disease had the highest incidence; whereas, children with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease had the lowest incidence. Children with leukodystrophies classified as astrocytopathies were more prone to have epilepsy than those classified as myelin disorders. Most children with leukodystrophies who presented with epilepsy showed a good response to antiepileptic drugs.","Zhang, Jie; Ban, Tingting; Zhou, Ling; Ji, Haoran; Yan, Huifang; Shi, Zhen; Cao, Binbin; Jiang, Yuwu; Wang, Jingmin; Wu, Ye",Journal of neurology,601,29

However the occurrence of MUC1 cleavage, which leads to the release of the extracellular α subunit into the circulation where it can sequester many anti-MUC1 antibodies, renders the target problematic to some degree. To address this issue, we generated a set of unique MUC1 monoclonal antibodies that target a region termed the SEA domain that remains tethered to the cell surface after MUC1 cleavage. In breast cancer cell populations, these antibodies bound the cancer cells with high picomolar affinity. Starting with a partially humanized antibody, DMB5F3, we created a recombinant chimeric antibody that bound a panel of MUC1+ cancer cells with higher affinities relative to cetuximab (anti-EGFR1) or tratuzumab (anti-erbB2) control antibodies. DMB5F3 internalization from the cell surface occurred in an efficient temperature-dependent manner. Linkage to toxin rendered these DMB5F3 antibodies to be cytotoxic against MUC1+ cancer cells at low picomolar concentrations. Our findings show that high-affinity antibodies to cell-bound MUC1 SEA domain exert specific cytotoxicity against cancer cells, and they point to the SEA domain as a potential immunogen to generate MUC1 vaccines.","Pichinuk, Edward; Benhar, Itai; Jacobi, Oded; Chalik, Michael; Weiss, Lotem; Ziv, Ravit; Sympson, Carolyn; Karwa, Amolkumar; Smorodinsky, Nechama I; Rubinstein, Daniel B; Wreschner, Daniel H",Cancer research,601,1

In clinical settings, cuff pressure often decreases from target values. METHODS We performed an experimental study to investigate the effects of measuring devices and endotracheal tubes on change in cuff pressure. We continuously measured cuff pressure by inserting a three-way stopcock in the middle of an ETT pilot balloon system. After adjusting the cuff pressure to 24 cmH2O, we disconnected and reconnected each cuff inflator to the inflation valve of the ETT and measured the changes in the cuff pressure. We measured the change in cuff pressure with different ETT sizes, cuff shapes, brands of cuff inflator, and with and without added extension tubes. RESULTS The cuff pressure decreased, on average, by 6.6 cmH2O (standard deviation 1.9), when connecting the cuff inflator to the pilot balloon. The measured cuff pressure was less than 20 cmH2O in 67% of the tests. The cuff pressure decreased more when an extension tube was used. The brand of cuff inflator made no difference to the pressure loss. The cuff pressure decreased more with ETTs of smaller size and with ETTs with pyriform cuffs. CONCLUSIONS Procedures to connect cuff inflators to inflation valves resulted in the loss of cuff pressure by 6.6 cmH2O on average.","Asai, Shota; Motoyama, Asuka; Matsumoto, Yuri; Konami, Hiroyuki; Imanaka, Hideaki; Nishimura, Masaji",Journal of intensive care,601,5

METHODS Using data collected from May 19 to August 17, 2020, this cross-sectional online study assessed 429 women to better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women during the postpartum period. Enrolled respondents were asked to participate in a 30-45-min online survey about COVID-19-related experiences, pregnancy, stress, and well-being. RESULTS Postpartum women's depressive symptoms were related to lower quality maternal-infant bonding, but the anxiety symptoms were not associated with bonding. Maternal self-efficacy, but not social support, was associated with mothers' higher quality of maternal-infant bonding. COVID-19-related grief was significantly associated with lower quality bonding. On the other hand, COVID-19-related health worries were associated with higher quality of maternal-infant bonding. CONCLUSIONS We describe potential psychological risk factors to maternal-infant bonding among postpartum women during the pandemic period. To best support the medical and psychological well-being of the mothers and infants, enhanced interdisciplinary partnerships among perinatal healthcare professionals involved in primary and/or specialty care is needed. IMPACT Unique COVID-19-related health and grief concerns exist, with implications for maternal-infant bonding. Depression but not anxiety is associated with lower maternal-infant bonding. Caregiving confidence, but not social support, is associated with higher maternal-infant bonding. It is critical to screen for postpartum depression and COVID-19-related grief during maternal follow-up and pediatric visits. Study findings inform and prioritize pediatric interventions toward enhancing maternal-infant bonding during the COVID-19 era.","Liu, Cindy H; Hyun, Sunah; Mittal, Leena; Erdei, Carmina",Pediatric research,601,1

Evidence from mechanistic data suggests that exposure to long working hours may increase alcohol consumption and cause alcohol use disorder. In this paper, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder that are attributable to exposure to long working hours, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates. OBJECTIVES We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of exposure to long working hours (three categories: 41-48, 49-54 and ≥55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on alcohol consumption, risky drinking (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence and mortality) and alcohol use disorder (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence and mortality). DATA SOURCES We developed and published a protocol, applying the Navigation Guide as an organizing systematic review framework where feasible. We searched electronic bibliographic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including the WHO International Clinical Trials Register, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and CISDOC on 30 June 2018. Searches on PubMed were updated on 18 April 2020. We also searched electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-searched reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consulted additional experts. STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA We included working-age (≥15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but excluded children (<15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. We considered for inclusion randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the effect of exposure to long working hours (41-48, 49-54 and ≥55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on alcohol consumption (in g/week), risky drinking, and alcohol use disorder (prevalence, incidence or mortality). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from publications related to qualifying studies. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias, quality of evidence and strength of evidence, using Navigation Guide and GRADE tools and approaches adapted to this project. RESULTS Fourteen cohort studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 104,599 participants (52,107 females) in six countries of three WHO regions (Americas, South-East Asia, and Europe). The exposure and outcome were assessed with self-reported measures in most studies. Across included studies, risk of bias was generally probably high, with risk judged high or probably high for detection bias and missing data for alcohol consumption and risky drinking. Compared to working 35-40 h/week, exposure to working 41-48 h/week increased alcohol consumption by 10.4 g/week (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.59-15.20; seven studies; 25,904 participants, I2 71%, low quality evidence). Exposure to working 49-54 h/week increased alcohol consumption by 17.69 g/week (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.16-26.22; seven studies, 19,158 participants, I2 82%, low quality evidence). Exposure to working ≥55 h/week increased alcohol consumption by 16.29 g/week (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.93-24.65; seven studies; 19,692 participants; I2 82%, low quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of exposure to working 41-48 h/week, compared with working 35-40 h/week on developing risky drinking (relative risk 1.08; 95% CI 0.86-1.36; 12 studies; I2 52%, low certainty evidence). Working 49-54 h/week did not increase the risk of developing risky drinking (relative risk 1.12; 95% CI 0.90-1.39; 12 studies; 3832 participants; I2 24%, moderate certainty evidence), nor working ≥55 h/week (relative risk 1.11; 95% CI 0.95-1.30; 12 studies; 4525 participants; I2 0%, moderate certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses indicated that age may influence the association between long working hours and both alcohol consumption and risky drinking. We did not identify studies for which we had access to results on alcohol use disorder. CONCLUSIONS Overall, for alcohol consumption in g/week and for risky drinking, we judged this body of evidence to be of low certainty. Exposure to long working hours may have increased alcohol consumption, but we are uncertain about the effect on risky drinking. We found no eligible studies on the effect on alcohol use disorder. Producing estimates for the burden of alcohol use disorder attributable to exposure to long working hours appears to not be evidence-based at this time.

However, the evidence supporting this treatment is not fully established. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on the effect of adjunctive thyroid hormone in the management of treatment-resistant unipolar depression and to provide a pooled estimate of its efficacy. METHODS The study is registered with PROSPERO (reg. no. CRD42018108088) and followed the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were carried out on June 24th , 2019 in PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Each record was screened independently by at least two reviewers. In instances of discrepancies, consensus was reached upon discussion. Pooled efficacy estimates were calculated based on response rates (decrease of ≥50% on the primary outcome measure) using random effect statistics. RESULTS The search yielded 1355 records. Based on the screening of these records, we identified 10 studies that met the inclusion criteria (total number of patients = 663). The comparison of response to thyroid hormones versus placebo resulted in an odds ratio of 1.56 (95%CI: 0.50-4.84). Similarly, the comparison of response to thyroid hormones versus lithium resulted in an odds ratio of 1.91 (95%CI: 0.85-4.26). Thus, adjunctive therapy with thyroid hormones was not superior to placebo or lithium in the management of treatment-resistant unipolar depression. CONCLUSION According to this review and meta-analysis, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of adjunctive thyroid hormones for treatment-resistant unipolar depression.","Lorentzen, Rasmus; Kjaer, Jesper Nørgaard; Østergaard, Søren Dinesen; Madsen, Michael Moesmann",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,601,1

Human landing catches (HLC) are ethically questionable where arboviral transmission occurs. The host decoy trap (HDT) is an exposure-free alternative outdoor sampling device. To determine HDT efficacy for local culicids, and to characterize local mosquito fauna, the trapping efficacy of the HDT was compared to that of HLCs in one peri-urban (Lakkang) and one rural (Pucak) village in Sulawesi, Indonesia. RESULTS In Lakkang the outdoor HLCs collected significantly more Anopheles per night (n = 22 ± 9) than the HDT (n = 3 ± 1), while the HDT collected a significantly greater nightly average of Culex mosquitoes (n = 110 ± 42), than the outdoor HLC (n = 15.1 ± 6.0). In Pucak, there was no significant difference in Anopheles collected between trap types; however, the HDT collected significantly more Culex mosquitoes than the outdoor HLC nightly average (n = 53 ± 11 vs 14 ± 3). Significantly higher proportions of blood-fed mosquitoes were found in outdoor HLC (n = 15 ± 2%) compared to HDT (n = 2 ± 0%). More blood-fed culicines were collected with outdoor HLC compared to the HDT, while Anopheles blood-fed proportions did not differ. For the HDT, 52.6%, 36.8% and 10.5% of identified blood meals were on cow, human, and dog, respectively. Identified blood meals for outdoor HLCs were 91.9% human, 6.3% cow, and 0.9% each dog and cat. Mosquitoes from Pucak were tested for arboviruses, with one Culex pool and one Armigeres pool positive for flavivirus, and one Anopheles pool positive for alphavirus. CONCLUSIONS The HDT collected the highest abundance of culicine specimens. Outdoor HLCs collected the highest abundance of Anopheles specimens. Although the HDT can attract a range of different Asian mosquito genera and species, it remains to be optimized for Anopheles in Asia. The high proportion of human blood meals in mosquitoes collected by outdoor HLCs raises concerns on the potential exposure risk to collectors using this methodology and highlights the importance of continuing to optimize a host-mimic trap such as the HDT.","Davidson, Jenna R; Baskin, Robert N; Hasan, Hajar; Burton, Timothy A; Wardiman, Muhammad; Rahma, Nur; Saputra, Fadly R; Aulya, Muhammad Sultanul; Wahid, Isra; Syafruddin, Din; Hawkes, Frances M; Lobo, Neil F",Parasites & vectors,601,1

METHODS We use machine learning to build predictive models of overall well-being and physical health among veterans as a function of these three sets of characteristics. We link Gallup's U.S. Daily Poll between 2014 and 2017 over a range of demographic and socio-economic characteristics with zipcode characteristics from the Census Bureau to build predictive models of overall and physical well-being. RESULTS Although the predictive models of overall well-being have weak performance, our classification of low levels of physical well-being performed better. Gradient boosting delivered the best results (80.2% precision, 82.4% recall, and 80.4% AUROC) with perceptions of purpose in the workplace and financial anxiety as the most predictive features. Our results suggest that additional measures of socio-economic characteristics are required to better predict physical well-being, particularly among vulnerable groups, like veterans. CONCLUSION Socio-economic characteristics explain large differences in physical and overall well-being. Effective predictive models that incorporate socio-economic data will provide opportunities to create real-time and personalized feedback to help individuals improve their quality of life.","Makridis, Christos A; Zhao, David Y; Bejan, Cosmin A; Alterovitz, Gil",Computers in biology and medicine,601,16

The computed tomography demonstrated a ""blowout aneurysm"" of the TC and SMA patch. The bypass to the left renal artery originated from the level of the TC. We therefore modified a commercially available t-branch (Cook® Medical, Bloomington, IN) with surgeon-made fenestrations for both renal arteries.

Aiming at the problems of single disinfection method, single application scenario, low degree of intelligence and lack of autonomous mobile disinfection in existing disinfection robots, this paper proposes and designs a disinfection and epidemic prevention intelligent robot called Aimi-Robot UVC, which is based on graph-optimized slam algorithm to complete the localization and map creation functions of the robot in the unknown environment. After testing in the isolated single ward of the hospital, the realtime localization accuracy reaches 0.04m, which provides high-precision and high-reliability localization for the disinfection robot in the hospital scene and has great practical significance for the application of intelligent disinfection robots in epidemic prevention and control. © 2021 IEEE.","Tan, X.; Zhang, H.; Zhou, X.; Zhong, H.; Liu, L.","2021 IEEE International Conference on Real-Time Computing and Robotics, RCAR 2021",601,25

Attending on the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, in this paper I gauge the nature of human rights in the areas of health and religion by interrogating how the general Muslim publics and elites understand, justify, and explain those challenges in an environment of creeping authoritarianism. I call for a conceptual shift from the elite-driven traditional security perspectives to those of human rights as quotidian/everyday experiences while considering these vital issues.

This article demonstrates that differences between conservatives’ and liberals’ responses to COVID-19 are mitigated when people perceive the virus itself to have agency. We propose that conservatives are generally more sensitive to threats that are relatively high (vs. low) in agency. Consequently, we find that greater perceived agency of the coronavirus increases its perceived threat among conservatives but not liberals, and that this interaction is driven by differences in the tendency to attribute responsibility to agential entities. We also explore the effect of these malleable threat perceptions on downstream consequences related to the pandemic, including planned in-person consumption frequency. This research offers public health officials, policy makers, and firms insight into how to communicate more effectively about the pandemic and contributes theoretically to the literature on political ideology and threat sensitivity. © 2021 Association for Consumer Research.

The study considers nostalgia as a strategy for dealing with the 2020 state of emergency during which the lack of physical contact and social experiences can create preconditions for anxiety, depression and fear leading to traumatic consequences. The research is based on empirical material actively collected using the method of the included observation in the period from the 15th of March 2020, when the state of emergency in connection with COVID-19 was declared in Bulgaria, until the 30th of June 2020. The purpose of the paper is to present the nostalgic modes in Facebook and to reveal the reasons for their success as communicative and social messages. Applying interdisciplinary and multimodal approach the study describes the nostalgic manifestations by classifying thematically the initiatives, communication strategies and topics, oriented towards the past, as well as revealing their meaning for the society. The results show that the main role of nostalgic Facebook modes is to unite people in times of isolation, to raise their spirit and thus save them from the traumas that the COVID-19 crisis can cause. The multimodal analysis of the Facebook images from the empirical data confirms that social media and modern technologies make it possible to create `new products` based on old stories or memories that acquire a new meaning in the specific COVID-19 situation, modelled by the culture and mentality of Bulgarians in isolation. © Todorova, Bilyana;Padareva-Ilieva, Gergana, 2021.","Todorova, B.; Padareva-Ilieva, G.",East European Journal of Psycholinguistics,601,8

Despite the diligent cumulative effort of academia, there is hardly any light in the end tunnel so far in developing efficient and sustainable treatment options to tackle this public health threat. Therefore, designing a suitable vaccine to overcome this hurdle calls for immediate attention. The current study aimed to design a multi-epitope based vaccine using immunoinformatics tools. Materials and Methods: We approached the structural proteins: S, E, and M proteins of SARS-CoV-2 since they facilitate the infection of the virus into a host cell. By using different bioinformatics tools and servers, the multiple B-cell and T-cell epitopes were predicted potential for the required vaccine design. The phylogenetic analysis provides in-depth knowledge on ancestral molecular changes and the molecular evolutionary relationship of S, E, and M proteins. Results: Based on the antigenicity and surface accessibility of the spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins, eight epitopes were selected by various B cell and T cell epitope prediction tools. Molecular docking was executed to interpret the binding interactions of these epitopes from where three potential epitopes WTAGAAAYY, YVYSRVKNL, and GTITVEELK were finalized with their noticeable higher binding affinity scores-9.1,-7.4, and-7.0 kcal/mol, respectively. It is noteworthy to mention that the targeted epitopes are believed to cover 91.09% of the population coverage worldwide. Conclusions: In sum, we identified the three most potential epitopes at length, which might be turned to our purpose of designing the peptide-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. © 2021 The Author(s).","Roy, A.

The framework used for the analysis is dyadic, encompassing tenets from semantic theory (which deals extensively with lexical choices as well as the determination of the meanings attached to them) and Systemic Functional Grammar. The analysis reveals that a writer's selection of lexical items in a particular text is a reflection of his mood. This plays a significant and important role in the writer's arrangement of the lexical items into peculiar sentence patterns in the text. Mood which is a system at the deep structure of Systemic Functional Grammar determines, to a very large extent, the language a writer employs in a text. Repetition in NCDC COVID-19 sensitisation messages is used to emphasize the importance of such words. It is meant to further convince the general public that only self-efforts or actions can prevent the spread of COVID-19 as majority of the repeated words are action stimulated words (verbs).","Ogunrinde, Ebenezer Deji Ajenifari Joshua Taiwo",Theory and Practice in Language Studies,601,16

Market perceptions of sovereign creditworthiness, as grounded in national political economies, cause a persistent segmentation of the euro area capital market between peer countries regarded as safe or risky. As a consequence, cross-border capital flows have an asymmetric effect on the public and private finances of creditor and debtor countries, adding to the asymmetric impact from their economic growth models. These financial asymmetries interact with public opinion and are in turn endogenous drivers of political choices for or against fiscal discipline and of political preferences for a stable domestic investor base of public debt. A common safe asset for the eurozone is necessary to mitigate the asymmetric systemic risks from volatile capital flows and establish a symmetric financial driver of steady output growth, fiscal soundness, and financial stability. This common mechanism for endogenous stabilisation would help to sustain euro area capital market integration and support the long-term viability of the euro.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we attended to a viral spread of incorrect and misleading information that compromised collective actions and public health measures to contain the spread of the disease. We investigated the influence of fear of COVID-19 on social and cognitive factors including believing in fake news, bullshit receptivity, overclaiming, and problem-solving-within two of the populations that have been severely hit by COVID-19: Italy and the United States of America. To gain a better understanding of the role of misinformation during the early height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also investigated whether problem-solving ability and socio-cognitive polarization were associated with believing in fake news. Results showed that fear of COVID-19 is related to seeking out information about the virus and avoiding infection in the Italian and American samples, as well as a willingness to share real news (COVID and non-COVID-related) headlines in the American sample. However, fear positively correlated with bullshit receptivity, suggesting that the pandemic might have contributed to creating a situation where people were pushed toward pseudo-profound existential beliefs. Furthermore, problem-solving ability was associated with correctly discerning real or fake news, whereas socio-cognitive polarization was the strongest predictor of believing in fake news in both samples. From these results, we concluded that a construct reflecting cognitive rigidity, neglecting alternative information, and black-and-white thinking negatively predicts the ability to discern fake from real news. Such a construct extends also to reasoning processes based on thinking outside the box and considering alternative information such as problem-solving.","Salvi, C.; Iannello, P.; Cancer, A.; McClay, M.; Rago, S.; Dunsmoor, J.

Methods: Recent rollout of Symkevi® meant that this adult CF service had already developed processes for the identification of suitable patients and medication distribution. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, innovative methods for clinical review, patient discussion, testing for liver function and occasionally genotype were developed. Furthermore, contract extensions and new paperwork for Homecare companies had to be produced as medication was delivered to patients’ homes. This established process involving multidisciplinary digital consultations, Bluetooth spirometry and self-administered postal blood tests was therefore replicated. Additionally, to ensure access for as many patients as possible we re-checked some genetic mutation results, especially where diagnosis pre-dated current testing technology. Results: This table shows the rate at which our patients were able to access Kaftrio®. Two thirds of patients had access to Kaftrio® a month after it was commissioned and 265 of the 348 eligible patients were taking Kaftrio® within 2 months.

Emergence of multi-drug resistant Shigella isolates and the lack of availability of Shigella vaccines have made the efforts in the development of new therapeutic strategies against shigellosis very pertinent. In our study we have analyzed a total of 241 conserved sequences from a 15 different conserved virulence genes of Shigella sp and through extensive rational validation using a plethora of computational algorithms; we primarily obtained fifty eight small-interfering RNA (siRNA) candidates. Further extensive computational validation showed only three siRNA candidates that were found to exhibit substantial functional efficacy, be non-immunogenic and have a thermodynamically stable and sterically feasible and thereby acceptable tertiary structure. These siRNA candidates are intended to suppress the expression of the virulence genes, namely: IpgD (siRNA 9) and OspB (siRNA 15 and siRNA 17) and thus act as a prospective tool in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. However, the findings of our study require further wet lab validation and optimization for regular therapeutic use in the treatment of shigellosis.","Palit, Parag; Chowdhury, Farhana Tasnim; Baruah, Namrata; Sarkar, Bonoshree; Mou, Sadia Noor; Kamal, Mehnaz; Siddiqua, Towfida Jahan; Noor, Zannatun; Ahmed, Tahmeed",bioRxiv,601,1

In this paper, we consider the task of forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases at the county level for the United States. Although multiple methods have been explored for this task, their performance has varied across space and time due to noisy data and the inherent dynamic nature of the pandemic. We present a forecasting pipeline which incorporates probabilistic forecasts from multiple statistical, machine learning and mechanistic methods through a Bayesian ensembling scheme, and has been operational for nearly 6 months serving local, state and federal policymakers in the United States. While showing that the Bayesian ensemble is at least as good as the individual methods, we also show that each individual method contributes significantly for different spatial regions and time points. We compare our model's performance with other similar models being integrated into CDC-initiated COVID-19 Forecast Hub, and show better performance at longer forecast horizons. Finally, we also describe how such forecasts are used to increase lead time for training mechanistic scenario projections. Our work demonstrates that such a real-time high resolution forecasting pipeline can be developed by integrating multiple methods within a performance-based ensemble to support pandemic response. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Adiga, A.; Wang, L.; Hurt, B.; Peddireddy, A.; Porebski, P.; Venkatramanan, S.; Lewis, B.

Regarding restrictive measures such as physical distancing and the successive returning of passengers after the intelligent lockdown, significant lack of transport capacity can be expected. In this paper, the transport capacity of a PT network is assessed, using a mathematical passenger route choice and train scheduling model. By analysing the overall number of transported passengers and the resulting link and train utilization; the networks capabilities of facilitating different demands under capacity restrictions (e.g. physical distancing) are addressed. The analysis is performed on the Dutch railway network. The results show that at most 50% of the pre-covid19 demand can be transported, while most of the trains will be highly utilized reaching their maximum occupation. Thus, significantly more parts of the network are becoming highly utilized, leading to a more congested and vulnerable system than in normal conditions before covid19.","Bevsinovi'c, Nikola; Szymula, Christopher",,601,16

Social bonds were stretched thin, racial inequity was brought to the forefront, and political polarization deepened. This context heightened the need for effective theoretical frameworks, strategies, and understandings of how to support positive and negative peace and build cultures of peace across varied contexts. In this special section, we present a compendium of articles highlighting various ways that psychologists support these efforts through peace education. The section developed in a pre-COVID context from Christie and Wagner's (Handbook on peace education, 2010, Psychology Press) call in this journal for peace psychology to be central to peace education. Although the articles themselves do not directly address COVID-19, the racial pandemic, or political polarization, they offer insights into how the intersection of peace psychology and peace education can be used to promote harmonious relations and societies in a post-2020 world. In this introduction, we define peace education and its connections to peace psychology and then summarize each of the articles in the special section while drawing applications to the challenges that emerged in 2020. The rich and diverse articles in this section discuss innovative approaches to peace education that are designed to promote and maintain cultures of peace. This work must continue and accelerate, and more psychologists must invest in advancing such approaches to enhancing the quality of life of individuals and groups worldwide.","Velez, Gabriel M.; Gerstein, Lawrence H.",Peace &amp; Conflict,601,1

The findings presented here are part of a larger international project (research-all.org). Methods: The subjects were students of primary and secondary schools in Krakow (N = 455), aged 11 to 18 (M = 15.38, SD = 2.10). The instruments used in this study were: the MHC-SF Karas, Cieciuch and Keyes wellbeing scale, the Connor-Davidson CD-RSC resilience scale, and the DASS-21 Lovibond scale designed to measure depression, anxiety and stress. The participants also reported the amount of time they spent on eight types of activity (online and offline) during and before social isolation. Results: Correlation analysis showed that the more time students spend actively in a virtual environment, the higher the level of depression (r = 0.27;p < 0.001), anxiety (r = 0.25;p < 0.001), stress (r = 0.25;p < 0.001). The duration of online activity is also negatively correlated with psychological well-being (r = -0.13;p = 0.013), emotional well-being (r = -0.15;p = 0.003) and social well-being (r = -0.12;p = 0.026). Well-being increases with a higher number of activities that are not mediated by a screen medium (r = 0.17;p = 0.001). Conclusions: Social isolation resulted in an increase in online activity both in education and in the social life of young people. The results obtained indicate the intensification of negative affectivity in adolescents who spend more time in the online environments. Moreover, the protective role of non-Internet physical and social activities for the mental health of young people has been demonstrated.","Sikorska, I.

Without an effective drug therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is essential when invasive mechanical ventilation fails in severe cases. Our study carried out a systematic review of the studies published in 2020 to analyze the mortality of patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 who required ECMO. Methods: A systematic review was conducted on Medline combining keywords on SARS-CoV-2 and ECMO. All studies published during 2020 with positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 treated with ECMO were included, whether observational studies or case series. However, due to the heterogeneity in the methodology of the studies, a proper statistical analysis could not be carried out, which ended up limiting our findings. Results: Our research identified 41 publications during this period including 2007 cases of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection who required invasive support with ECMO. Among these, 985 (49%) improved clinically and were decannulated or discharged from the hospital, while 660 (32.8%) died despite invasive mechanical support. Only 357 patients (17.7%) still needed ventilation support with ECMO at the time of publication of these studies without describing the final clinical outcome. Conclusions: ECMO therapy could be useful in patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 according to the recommendations established in the clinical guidelines and based on the availability of financial resources during the pandemic. Conducting a randomized clinical trial comparing the use of ECMO with conventional invasive ventilatory therapy would provide more evidence on this regard and, consequently, more data on the management of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2021 Sociedad Española de Cardiología.

Considering the rarity of this disease, the management of TETs is still challenging and difficult. In fact, all the worldwide clinical practice guidelines are based on data from retrospective analyses, prospective single arm trials or experts' opinions. The results of combined modality therapy (chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy) in thymic malignancies are reasonably good in less advanced cases whereas in case of advanced (unsuitable for surgery) or metastatic disease, a platinum-based chemotherapy is considered standard of care. Unfortunately, chemotherapy in the palliative setting has modest efficacy. Moreover, due to the lack of known oncogenic molecular alterations, no targeted therapy has been shown to be efficient for these tumours. In order to offer the best diagnostic and therapeutic tools, patients with TETs should be managed with a continuous and specific multidisciplinary expertise at any step of the disease, especially in the era of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Current evidences show that cancer patients might have more severe symptoms and poorer outcomes from COVID-19 infection than general population. With the exception of the patients carrying a Good's syndrome, there is no evidence that patients with TETs present a higher risk of infection compared with other cancer patients and their management should be the same. The aim of this review is to summarize the existing literature about systemic treatments for TETs in all clinical setting (local and locally advanced/metastatic disease) exploring how these therapeutic strategies have been managed in the COVID-19 era. © Mediastinum.

There has been a call for action in education policy to provide a more flexible, digitally based learning strategy. It is presumed that this change in learning methods will reduce meaningful learning experiences. Methods: This study examines the application of discovery learning in the digital classroom and its effect on learning outcomes and independent learning. The research employed a quasi-experiment method, and the sample was taken using a randomized sampling technique. Two classes with the same initial knowledge value were used as experimental and control groups. The instrument used was a cognitive test and a Self-Directed Learning (SDL) questionnaire. Results: The results of this research show that there is a significant difference in learning outcomes and SDL in the experiment and control group. Students that apply discovery learning with a combination of face-to-face and digital classes get better results on both variables than in conventional discovery class. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the application of discovery learning through the digital classroom has a positive effect on learning outcomes and students’ level of independence. This study was only conducted in one secondary school and more samples are recommended for further study. The limitations of the application of face-to-face discovery learning can be overcome by the application of online learning, which facilitates meaningful learning experiences for students. © 2021.

A significant reduction in both proliferation and differentiation of deficient AT2 cells was observed in vivo and in 3D organoid cultures. This decrease was mainly restored by uPA derived A6 peptide, a binding fragment to CD44 receptors. The proliferative and differential rate of CD44+ AT2 cells was greater than that of CD44− controls. There was a reduction in transepithelial ion transport in deficient monolayers compared to wt cells. Moreover, we found a marked suppression in total AT2 cells and CD44+ subpopulation in lungs from brain dead patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a mouse model infected by influenza viruses.

Moreover, among other aims, it analyzes if teachers’ perceived negative impact of DL on life influenced WFC and negative affect. Finally, it examines differences in DL-related variables concerning gender, area of living, type of school, and teacher type. A path analysis model and MANOVAs on 587 teachers (Mage = 48.80±9.17) have been performed. Among the main findings, workaholism is a positive predictor of WFC, negative affect, and DL negative impact on work and life. Work engagement, instead, is a negative predictor of these variables and a positive predictor of DL perceived efficacy. However, workaholism is a stronger predictor than work engagement. Moreover, DL negative impact on life is a positive predictor of negative affect, while DL perceived efficacy for students negatively predicts it. Finally, DL negative impact on life predicts WFC. In conclusion, this study suggests that it is imperative to reduce workaholism (and increase study engagement) to improve teachers’ well-being and work quality during DL. Moreover, Schools’ Heads should implement training to help teachers to face the technical and educational issues posed by DL (especially for teachers working in kindergarten and secondary school and with children with special needs) to make them able to provide DL of good quality. They should also provide teachers with psychological support to help them cope with the distress felt due to the changes in their work, which affected their balance between work and life (especially in primary and secondary schools). © 2021, Amfiteatru Economic.

While the articles in the special issue do not deal centrally with the topic of the global COVID-19 pandemic, their critiques of the role of gender in transnational media—in various contexts—all point to the pressing need to think beyond the politically limiting optics of national histories and the boundaries of the nation-state, which we would argue is needed now more than ever.

There are overall increased mental health concerns in many countries but it is unclear what the general public individuals who do not have heighten vulnerability to stressors for existing mental diseases or significant physical illnesses were experiencing during the pandemic. We evaluated the stressors and mental health of general public in South Korea that has a relatively low confirmed cases and deaths. Responses on the on-line survey questions were used to assess the mental and physical symptoms in association with individuals' reported stressors. Individuals with the symptoms of the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were reported in 58.9%, and major depression (MD) in 23.2%, mostly in minimal to mild degrees, cut-off scores of 5 and 10, respectively by the validated screening tools, GAD-7 and PHQ-9. Both GAD and MD symptoms were in 21.5% of the respondents. The total number of stress had significant association with the scores of GAD-7, PHQ-9, physical symptoms, sleep difficulties and resilience (p < 0.01). GAD scores were also associated with sleep difficulties (p < 0.01) and raising young children (p < 0.05). MD scores were associated with sleep difficulties, job-dissatisfaction, and educational level (p < 0.05). The limitations of the study include small sample size, usage of smartphone or email, potential under-reporting by stigma in the socio-cultural context and evolving nature of pandemic. We conclude that keeping careful watch for mental symptoms, stressors, sleep difficulties and other physical symptoms are important even for the individuals without previous mental illnesses during the pandemic era.","Kim, K.

Herein, we attend to the generalization of this action throughout the world, specifically in its quest to reduce mortality and avoid infections. Considering the impact on the right to education from a global perspective, this article discusses how COVID-19 has exacerbated inequalities and pre-existing problems in education systems around the world. Therefore, the institutional responses to guaranteeing remote continuity of the teaching–learning process during this educational crisis was compared regionally through international databases. Three categories of analysis were established: infrastructure and equipment, both basic and computer-based, as well as internet access of schools;preparation and means of teachers to develop distance learning;and implemented measures and resources to continue educational processes. The results showed an uneven capacity in terms of response and preparation to face the learning losses derived from school closure, both in low-income regions and within middle- and high-income countries. We concluded that it is essential to articulate inclusive educational policies that support strengthening the government response capacity, especially in low-income countries, to address the sustainability of education.","Luis Miguel Lázaro, Lorente Ana Ancheta Arrabal",Sustainability,601,1

Objective: To discuss in detail the varied effects of COVID-19 on the oncology field. Methods: For this narrative review, the researchers relied only on accredited and peer-reviewed resources. As such, the references of this paper were mostly taken from Google Scholar and online repositories, such as PubMed, which hosts the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Science Direct, JSTOR, and The Lancet. Results: COVID-19 and the necessity of physical distancing have significantly changed the practice in the oncology field. The use of telehealth is widely adopted, physicians are recommended to consider other forms of treatment, and decisions on immediate cancer treatment depend on the level of risk of progression with cancer care delay. Cancer treatment delay is causing the highest mortality rate for patients who are suffering from cancer of the bladder, lungs, ovary, stomach, and esophagus. COVID-19 has shifted the focus of healthcare professionals away from other life-threatening diseases, like cancer. In the United Kingdom, it has been projected that there is at least a 20% increase in the expected cancer-related mortality rate. This is due to abrupt changes in diagnosing and treating cancer patients, physical distancing protocols, economic downfall, as well as the public's behavior in opting for medical assistance. Conclusion: With the spread of COVID-19, the situation has become more difficult for cancer patients. The mortality rate for cancer patients has worsened during COVID-19. Health professionals working in the oncology field are also devastated by COVID-19.","Turkistani, F.; Bin Sawad, A.",Journal of Pharmaceutical Research International,601,1

Here, we assessed the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-mediated immunity in a heterogeneous cohort of public university employees in Karaganda, Kazakhstan. Methods: Asymptomatic subjects (n=100) were randomly recruited prior to their first COVID-19 vaccination. Questionnaires were administered to capture a range of demographic and clinical characteristics. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing. Serological assays were performed to detect spike (S)-reactive IgG and IgA. Results: Anti-S IgG and IgA seropositivity rates among SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative participants (n=100) were 42% and 53%, respectively, and 61% of subjects tested positive for at least one of the antibodies. Serologically confirmed history of COVID-19 was associated with self-reported history of respiratory illness since March 2020 (p<0.001). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 exposure in this cohort is ~15-fold higher compared to the reported all-time national and regional COVID-19 prevalence. Continuous serological surveillance is critical for understanding the COVID-19 transmission dynamics and should be nationally implemented to better inform the public health response in Central Asia.","Kadyrova, I.; Yegorov, S.; Negmetzhanov, B.; Kolesnikova, Y.; Kolesnichenko, S.; Korshukov, I.; Akhmaltdinova, L.; Vazenmiller, D.; Turmukhambetova, A.; Miller, M.

Its temporary tourism function demands almost no additional construction work, meaning no permanent modification of space is needed for tourism purposes. Fortifications and defence buildings are recognised as valuable cultural attractions and present an anthropogenic resource with potential for touristic valorisation, both as sightseeing facilities as well as accommodation facilities. This paper explores the connection between the requirements of heritage protection of fortifications and the requirements of the application of indoor camping in these fortifications. The purpose of this paper is to help conserve fortifications by providing funding for their maintenance with the application of this innovative accommodation model respecting the principles of sustainability and health and safety standards in post-Covid tourism. The goal is to provide a general framework that could reconcile tourism businesses on one side and conservators on the other. The main scientific contribution is summarised in the framework of adequate implementation of indoor camping in fortified buildings according to conservators' requirements. The interview technique was used to assess this. The authors found that indoor camping can be a suitable accommodation model in fortified buildings. The key limitation of the model is based on the fact that an individual approach is necessary for every heritage building, as well as fortification, since they are unique. Therefore, each application of an indoor camping model should receive a proper conservators' permit before the entrepreneurship venture. Furthermore, the opinions of key stakeholders were also investigated.","Pamic, R. K.; Slivar, I.; Floricic, T.",Sustainability,601,32

The ICU ventilator system is one of the breathing apparatus that works invasively where its use is by inserting a breathing apparatus through the patient's mouth or nose. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is one of the variables that must be regulated in an ICU ventilator system because it affects the level of oxygen that enters the human body. Mixing of air and oxygen gas is done automatically using PID control which is applied to the proportional flow control valve of air and oxygen. This paper discusses the control of PID-based Fraction of inspired oxygen implanted in the ICU Ventilator. Adjusting the ratio of airflow and oxygen mixed in the mixing tank will produce airflow with the desired fraction of inspired oxygen. Teensy 4.0 Microcontroller and the C programming language are used to execute the PID control algorithm. In this study, the best Kp, Ki, and Kd values were determined using the PID Tuner, for the air proportional flow setpoint and oxygen proportional flow setpoints of 30, 60, and 100 LPM, respectively. These values are able to produce precise and accurate control of the FiO2 according to the desired setpoint on the ICU Ventilator. The results of the FiO2 test obtained an average value for rise time of 13478 ms, overshoot of 0.11%, settling time of 19803 ms, and steady-state error of 1.15%. Meanwhile, the results of the inspiratory flow test obtained an average value for a rise time of 964 ms, an overshoot of 5.43%, a settling time of 4697 ms, and a steady-state error of 0.98%. © 2021 IEEE.","Radzi, M.

Then, the inverse problem about parameter estimation for these fractional-order SEIAR models of the Norovirus outbreak is studied firstly. To provide the numerical solution of the single-term (or multiterm) fractional-order nonlinear differential equation, the GMMP scheme and Newton method are introduced. Then, we make use of the modified hybrid Nelder-Mead simplex search and particle swarm optimization (MH-NMSS-PSO) algorithm to obtain the fractional orders and parameters for these fractional-order SEIAR models of Norovirus outbreak. To guarantee the correctness and effectiveness of the methods, the data of a 2007 Norovirus outbreak in a middle school in one city is used as the real data to solve the inverse problem of the parameter estimation. With the new parameters, all numerical studies illustrate that the numerical solutions fit very well with the real data, which reveals that the single-term and multiterm fractional-order SEIAR models of Norovirus outbreak all can predict the number of the infectious people accurately. And it also shows that the GMMP scheme and the MH-NMSS-PSO method are efficient and valid for estimating the parameters of the single-term (or multiterm) fractional-order nonlinear equations. Then, we research the impact of changes in each parameter on the amount of infected humans It when the remaining parameters are unchanged. All results of numerical simulation reveal that the single-term and multiterm fractional-order SEIAR model of Norovirus can provide better results than other models. And we also study the effect of the isolation on different days. The conclusion is obtained that the earlier the isolation is taken, the less the infected people are. Hence, for a fractional-order application in the SEIAR model of Norovirus outbreak, we establish the effective parameter estimation methods.","Li, Tianzeng Wang Yu Pan Weiqiu",Advances in Mathematical Physics,601,11

While most cases in children remain mild, studies in pediatric T2D are limited. Our study aim was to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 course in youth with T2D. We conducted a retrospective review of electronic medical records of patients with T2D and positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing performed at Texas Children's Hospital between 3/1/2020 and 10/31/2020. Demographics, diabetes treatment regimen, metrics of glycemic control, and variables of COVID-19 course were recorded and analyzed. We identified 14 youth with active T2D and positive SARS-CoV-2 testing. All individuals had established diabetes;none were concurrently diagnosed with new onset T2D and SARS-CoV-2. Of them, 43% [n=6] were African-American, 57% [n=8] Hispanic, and none were Non-Hispanic Whites. All individuals had public medical insurance and were obese, with mean BMI Z score =+2.22 [SD =0.48]. Median last hemoglobin A1C within 3 months prior to testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was 13.2% [IQR= 2.50%], with 27% [n=3] patients' last A1C above the limit of detection [>14.0%] and 91% [n=10] above the American Diabetes Association Standards of Care goal of 7.0%.

However, the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic has posed particular obstacles that had to be overcome in order to allow Educational Robotics activities to be conducted in distance learning. In the first place, the obligation to work from home limited the access to required equipment for many students. Secondly, many teachers had to face the novel challenge of creating pedagogically meaningful activities in online learning formats. Aiming to address these challenges, this work explored maker-based approaches as a way to implement Educational Robotics activities in online learning. The devised tools and activities were evaluated in two case studies performed with (i) high school students participating in a mobile robotics summer school and (ii) in-service teachers attending a professional development course on Educational Robotics. The teachers' and students' perception of the proposed activities was analyzed using online surveys and video interviews. The findings showed that the combination of the devised tools and activities allowed teachers and students to explore the basics of mobile robotics while helping them develop a maker mindset. The use of ubiquitous construction materials and affordable electronic components promotes the accessibility of the approach. The proposed tools and activities may therefore provide an exemplary framework for more general applications of Educational Robotics in online learning that go beyond the context of emergency remote teaching. © 2013 IEEE.","Mehrotra, A.; Giang, C.; El-Hamamsy, L.; Guinchard, A.; Dame, A.; Zahnd, G.; Mondada, F.",IEEE Access,601,16

There is evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of the UK population, but this needs synthesising to guide effective policy recommendations and ensure support is targeted to populations most at risk. We conducted a rapid systematic review of the evidence of the impact of COVID-19 and associated restrictions on the mental health of UK adults, including risk and protective factors. Method. A range of databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Studies were eligible if they reported primary quantitative or qualitative research on the mental health of UK adults between March 2020 and March 2021. Journal publications and pre-prints were included. Reviews, position papers, protocol papers and studies published in languages other than English were excluded. The study authors screened papers for eligibility and included 102 papers in the analysis. Results. The evidence from this review indicates that the mental health of UK adults has declined since the start of the pandemic, with different populations being unequally affected. Populations particularly affected are women, young adults, ethnic minorities, people from lower socio-economic backgrounds, people with pre-existing conditions and people who have had COVID-19. Other risk factors include having to isolate and time spent watching pandemic related news. Protective factors include social contact and maintaining healthy behaviours, such as physical activity. Conclusions. Policy should aim to discourage risky behaviours while ensuring support is available for people to engage in protective behaviours. Interventions should be directed towards populations that have been most adversely affected. Addressing the decline in mental health across the UK population since the COVID-19 pandemic will require increasing mental health provision and ensuring equitable access to support.","Batteux, E.; Taylor, J.; Carter, H.",,601,1

Here, we developed a platform with engineered crRNAs and optimized conditions that enabled us to detect DNA, DNA/RNA heteroduplex and methylated DNA with higher sensitivity, achieving a limit of detection of in femtomolar range without any target pre-amplification step. By extending the 3’- or 5’-ends of the crRNA with different lengths of ssDNA, ssRNA, and phosphorothioate ssDNA, we discovered a new self-catalytic behavior and an augmented rate of LbCas12a-mediated collateral cleavage activity as high as 3.5-fold compared to the wild-type crRNA.

A multitude of factors likely account for this discrepancy. Gene expression represents the interaction of genetics and environment. To elucidate whether levels of expression of genes implicated in COVID-19 vary in African Americans as compared to European Americans, we re-mine The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) RNA-Seq data. Multiple genes integral to infection, inflammation and immunity are differentially regulated across the two populations. Most notably, F8A2 and F8A3, which encode the HAP40 protein that mediates early endosome movement in Huntington’s Disease, are more highly expressed by up to 24-fold in African Americans. Such differences in gene expression can establish prognostic signatures and have critical implications for precision treatment of diseases such as COVID-19. We advocate routine inclusion of information such as postal code, education level, and profession (as a proxies for socioeconomic condition) and race in the metadata about each individual sampled for sequencing studies.

Design: We applied the Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI), a methodological framework developed by the INFORMAS network. Qualitative content analysis of laws, directives and other documents formed the basis of a multi-staged, structured consultation process. Setting: Germany. Participants: The expert consultation process included 55 experts from academia, public administration, and civil society. Results: Germany lags behind international best practices in several key policy areas. For 18 policy indicators, the degree of implementation compared to international best practices was rated as very low, for 21 as low, for 8 as intermediate, and for none as high. In particular, indicators on food taxation, regulation of food marketing, and retail and food service sector policies were rated as very low to low. Identified priority actions included the binding implementation of nutrition standards for schools and kindergartens, a reform of the value added tax on foods and beverages, a sugar-sweetened beverage tax and stricter regulation of food marketing directed at children. Conclusions: The results show that Germany makes insufficient use of the potential of evidence-informed health-promoting nutrition policies. Adopting international best practices in key policy areas could help to reduce the burden of nutrition-related chronic disease and related inequalities in nutrition and health in Germany.

The main objective of the study was to investigate the students' and teachers' attitudes towards Online learning during the COVID-19 situation in Bangladeshi Government Colleges. Findings revealed that cost and time-effectiveness, safety, convenience, and improved participation were the most frequently cited positive aspects of the online learning experience, while distraction and reduced focus, heavy workload, problems with technology and the internet, lack of ICT knowledge, and poor network infrastructure, limited availability of educational resources, low attendance of learners, uncooperative learners and insufficient support from instructors and colleagues were the most recurrent negative aspects. The qualitative and quantitative research method was adopted, with semi-structured interviews conducted via Zoom with 10 College teachers and Focus group discussion conducted via Zoom with 18 and survey 100 college students via Google platform from three Bangladesh renowned Government College from Hons 1st year to masters' level located in Rajshahi divisional district town of the country. A sample of these essays was analyzed using open coding. The findings of the study help instructors and institutions understand students' and Teachers' attitudes regarding online teaching & learning under abnormal circumstances. Several recommendations informed by the interpretation of the participants' feedback are offered to assist instructors, administrators, and policymakers improve future online learning experiences.

The relevance of the study is due to the situation of the spread of coronavirus infection, the peculiarities of combating its spread, the influence of information technologies on this process and the need to understand the phenomena that have developed in society. The novelty of the research lies in the complex consideration of various social and individual psychological phenomena from the standpoint of the influence of the vital threat and existential fears on the individual and social consciousness. The article contains information on the socio-psychological phenomena that manifested themselves during the COVID-19 pandemic (alarmism, infodemic, intergroup tensions, stigmatization of certain groups of the population, a shift in political preferences, aggravation or emergence of mental disorders, inadequate purchasing activity) and describes them in terms of Terror Management Theory. In the conclusion, prospects are given for using the provisions of Terror Management Theory to develop a strategy for overcoming a pandemic situation, taking into account the action of proximal and distal defenses.

Human activities, especially at the wildlife interphase, are at the core of forces driving the emergence of new viral agents. Global surveillance activities have identified bats as the natural hosts of diverse coronaviruses, with other domestic and wildlife animal species possibly acting as intermediate or spillover hosts. The African continent is confronted by several factors that challenge prevention and response to novel disease emergences, such as high species diversity, inadequate health systems, and drastic social and ecosystem changes. We reviewed published animal coronavirus surveillance studies conducted in Africa, specifically summarizing surveillance approaches, species numbers tested, and findings. Far more surveillance has been initiated among bat populations than other wildlife and domestic animals, with nearly 26,000 bat individuals tested. Though coronaviruses have been identified from approximately 7% of the total bats tested, surveillance among other animals identified coronaviruses in less than 1%. In addition to a large undescribed diversity, sequences related to four of the seven human coronaviruses have been reported from African bats. The review highlights research gaps and the disparity in surveillance efforts between different animal groups (particularly potential spillover hosts) and concludes with proposed strategies for improved future biosurveillance.","Geldenhuys, M.; Mortlock, M.; Epstein, J.

Thus, to provide a well-conceptualized viewpoint demonstrating the prognostic value of thrombocytopenia in COVID-19, we performed a meta-analysis of pertinent literature. Methods The keywords ""platelet"" OR ""thrombocytopenia"" AND ""COVID-19"" OR ""coronavirus 2019"" OR ""2019-nCoV"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" were searched in National Library of Medicine Medline/PubMed and Scopus between December 30, 2019, and May 9, 2020 in English without any restriction. The initial search results were first screened by title and abstract, and then full texts of relevant articles representing information on the platelet count (main outcome) with a clinically validated deﬁnition of COVID-19 severity were ﬁnally selected. To assess the existence of bias in the included studies, the funnel plot and egger plot along with egger tests were used. Also, the heterogeneity among the included studies was tested using the Chi-square test. Results The results of our meta-analysis of 19 studies, totaling 3383 COVID-19 patients with 744 (21.9%) severe cases, revealed that non-severe cases have a significantly higher number of platelets and showed that the probability of the emergence of thrombocytopenia is significantly higher in the severe cases with the pooled mean difference of -21.5 (%95 CI: -31.57, -11.43). Conclusion Decreased number of platelets more commonly associates with severe COVID-19; however, whether the emergence of thrombocytopenia may result in diseases severity or the severity of the disease may decrease platelets, is open to debate.","Bashash, Davood; Hosseini-Baharanchi, Fatemeh Sadat; Rezaie-Tavirani, Mostafa; Safa, Majid; Akbari Dilmaghani, Nader; Faranoush, Mohammad; Abolghasemi, Hassan",Archives of academic emergency medicine,601,24

The method is based on counting the appearance frequency of oligopeptides of a fixed length (up to K = 6) in the collection of protein sequences of a species. It is a method without fine adjustment and choice of genes. Applied to prokaryotic genomes it has led to results comparable with the bacteriologists' systematics as reflected in the latest 2002 outline of the Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. The method has also been used to compare chloroplast genomes and to the phylogeny of Coronaviruses including human SARS-CoV. A key point in our approach is subtraction of a random background from the original counts by using a Markov model of order K-2 in order to highlight the shaping role of natural selection. The implications of the subtraction procedure is specially analyzed and further development of the new approach is indicated.,"Hao, Bailin; Qi, Ji",Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,601,1

Two distinct surveys were carried on: a case-control study including 32 diarrheic calves and 21 healthy calves bred in 53 different farms; and a separate study on nine diarrheic calves in another farm. The following infectious agents were looked for, by specific methods of detection: Escherichia coli K99 and E. coli lethal for mice, Salmonella species, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens, Chlamydia psittaci, rotaviruses, coronaviruses, Cryptosporidium. In the case-control survey, no enterotoxigenic E. coli (K99+) was detected in either group of calves. Four agents were more often detected in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves, i.e. rotavirus (12/32 vs 1/21), lethal E. coli (6/32 vs 1/21), Cryptosporidium (2/32 vs 0/21) and Salmonella typhimurium (1/32 vs 0/21). One at least of these four agents was present in 16 diarrheic calves (50%) vs only 2 healthy calves (10%) (P less than 0.01). On the other hand, the occurrence of Campylobacter jejuni and of C. perfringens, enterotoxin was similar in both groups of calves, accounting respectively for about 20% and 10% of total calves. Moreover, coronavirus-like particles were significatively associated with healthy calves (7/32 vs 11/21; P less than 0.05). In the other study, all the main categories of enteropathogens were detected throughout the period of observation in the same farm with the exception of enterotoxigenic E. coli. But each calf taken individually was rarely shedding more than two agents at a time. In addition, specific antibodies against C. perfringens enterotoxin, as tested in an ELISA test, were present in the serum of all the calves examined in both surveys. This study confirms the primary role of rotavirus and Cryptosporidium as agents of diarrhea in calves under three weeks. It also suggests the possible participation of E. coli strains that are lethal for mice and underlines the potential hazard for human health of bovine reservoirs of Campylobacter jejuni and enterotoxigenic C. perfringens.","De Rycke, J; Bernard, S; Laporte, J; Naciri, M; Popoff, M R; Rodolakis, A",Annales de recherches veterinaires.

From 29 February to 31 March, there was a 100.9-fold increase in the cumulative number of cases and a 428.6-fold increase in the number of deaths in Italy. When plotted on a semilogarithmic scale, the curves tended to diverge from linearity with 23%, 16%, and 7% average daily increases during the three decades of March. Similarly, the number of deaths decreased from an average daily growth of 19% over the second decade to 10% over the third decade. The correlation coefficients relating the days to cases or deaths over each one of the three decades approached unity. As inferred from the equations of the regression lines relative to the three decades, the doubling times of cases were 3.4, 5.1, and 9.6 days, respectively. The doubling times of deaths over the second and third decades were 4.9 and 7.0 days, respectively. There was a broad geographic variability, with a striking gradient from the North, where 40.8% of cases and 57.9% of deaths occurred in Lombardy, to the South.

We report results from our MGT program and emphasize its utility during the COVID-19 lockdown, when cancer genetics clinics had suspended their activity. METHODS: An MGT pathway for breast and ovarian cancer (BC/OC) patients was established in Jan-2018 between the Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris.Sorbonne Université Cancer Genetics team and the Oncology/Gynecology departments at one teaching and two regional hospitals. Trained O + G evaluated patients with the Manchester Scoring System. A 12-point threshold was recommended for testing. Next-generation sequencing of BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C and RAD51D was performed. Results were delivered to the patient by O/G. Pathogenic variants (PV) carriers were referred to the genetics clinic. Results are reported for the 2nd-Jan-2018 to 1st-June-2020 period. That includes the eight-week COVID-19 lockdown and three-week de-confinement phase 1. RESULTS: Results were available for 231/234 patients. Twenty-eight (12.1%) carried a PV. Of the 27 patients tested during the COVID-19 period, three carried a PV, two in BRCA1 and one in RAD51C. The clinical impact was immediate for the two BRCA1 BC cases undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, since double mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy will now be performed using two-step strategies.

Much research has focused on illuminant estimation for CCC on single images, with few attempts of leveraging the temporal information intrinsic in sequences of correlated images (e.g., the frames in a video), a task known as Temporal Colour Constancy (TCC). The state-of-the-art for TCC is TCCNet, a deep-learning architecture that uses a ConvLSTM for aggregating the encodings produced by CNN submodules for each image in a sequence. We extend this architecture with different models obtained by (i) substituting the TCCNet submodules with C4, the state-of-the-art method for CCC targeting images; (ii) adding a cascading strategy to perform an iterative improvement of the estimate of the illuminant. We tested our models on the recently released TCC benchmark and achieved results that surpass the state-of-the-art. Analyzing the impact of the number of frames involved in illuminant estimation on performance, we show that it is possible to reduce inference time by training the models on few selected frames from the sequences while retaining comparable accuracy.","Rizzo, Matteo; Conati, Cristina; Jang, Daesik; Hu, Hui",,601,26

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of the medical records of 268 adult patients, who were admitted to one of the six cohorted COVID ICUs across Emory Healthcare System and had at least two CRP values within the first seven days of admission to study the temporal progression of CRP and its association with all-cause in-hospital mortality. The median CRP during hospitalization for the entire cohort was 130 mg/L (IQR 82-191 mg/L), and the median CRP on ICU admission was 169 (IQR 111-234). The hospitalization-wide median CRP was significantly higher amongst the patients who died, compared to those who survived [206 mg/L (157-288 mg/L) vs 114 mg/L (72-160 mg/L), p<0.001]. CRP levels increased in a linear fashion during the first week of hospitalization and peaked on day 5. Compared to patients who died, those who survived had lower peak CRP levels and earlier declines. CRP levels were significantly higher in patients who died compared to those who survived (p<0.001).

METHODS: 108-Sprague Dawle male rats were randomly allocated into 6 equal groups differently receiving aqueous or methanolic fruit and seed extracts. Assay of serum creatinine, BUN and TNF-&#945;, morphological examination of the left kidney, markers of the redox state (MDA, CAT, and GSH), the expression of TNF&#945; and Nrf2 genes at the level of mRNA, the expression of caspase-3 and TGF-ß proteins by immunohistochemistry were performed. RESULTS: 45-min renal I/R caused significant deterioration of kidney functions (increase in serum creatinine and BUN) and morphology (P < 0.001) and significant reduction in CAT activity and GSH levels with significant increase in serum TNF-&#945; and MDA concentration and the expression of Nrf2, caspase-3, TNF-&#945;, and TGF-ß in kidney tissues. Pre-treatment with either date palm fruit or seed extracts significantly improved kidney functions and morphology (P &#8804; 0.001) with a significant increase in the expression of Nrf2 and CAT activity, and GSH concentration and a reduction in serum TNF-&#945; and expression of caspase-3, TNF-&#945;, and TGF-ß (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of date palm extracts exhibited a renoprotective effect against renal I/R injury.This renoprotective action might be due to their antioxidants, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory actions. Moreover, aqueous fruit extracts offered powerful renoprotective effect than aqueous seed extracts, and aqueous fruit and seed extracts were generally more effective than methanolic extracts.","Alghamdi, Mansour A; Hussein, Abdelaziz M; Al-Eitan, Laith N; Elnashar, Eman; Elgendy, Ahmed; Abdalla, Asim M; Ahmed, Seham; Khalil, Wael A",Biomed Pharmacother,601,17

The survey was repeated among a subsample of the participants in April 2020, after strict physical distancing measures were implemented, and in an extended sample in June 2020, after some measures were relaxed.ResultsThe average number of community contacts per day was reduced from 14.9 (interquartile range (IQR): 4-20) in the 2016-17 survey to 3.5 (IQR: 0-4) after strict physical distancing measures were implemented, and rebounded to 8.8 (IQR: 1-10) after some measures were relaxed. All age groups restricted their community contacts to at most 5, on average, after strict physical distancing measures were implemented. In children, the number of community contacts reverted to baseline levels after measures were eased, while individuals aged 70 years and older had less than half their baseline levels.ConclusionStrict physical distancing measures greatly reduced overall contact numbers, which likely contributed to curbing the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands. However, age groups reacted differently when measures were relaxed, with children reverting to normal contact numbers and elderly individuals maintaining restricted contact numbers.

We hypothesized that males and females in different age groups might have different epidemic trajectories. METHODS: Using publicly available data from South Korea, daily new COVID-19 cases were assessed using generalized additive models, assuming Poisson and negative binomial distributions. Epidemic dynamics by age and gender groups were explored using interactions between smoothed time terms and age and gender. RESULTS: A negative binomial distribution fitted the daily case counts best. The relationship between the dynamic patterns of daily new cases and age groups was statistically significant (p<0.001), but this was not the case with gender groups. People aged 20-39 years led the epidemic processes in South Korean society with two peaks - one major peak around March 1 and a smaller peak around April 7, 2020. The epidemic process among people aged 60 or above trailed behind that of the younger age group, and with smaller magnitude. After March 15, there was a consistent decline of daily new cases among elderly people, despite large fluctuations in case counts among young adults. CONCLUSIONS: Although young people drove the COVID-19 epidemic throughout society, with multiple rebounds, elderly people could still be protected from infection after the peak of the epidemic.","Yu, Xinhua; Duan, Jiasong; Jiang, Yu; Zhang, Hongmei",Int J Infect Dis,601,2

We evaluated the risk of COVID-19 among migrants from different areas of the world within the context of universal free access to medical care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort analysis of the cumulative incidence of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 among adult residents of Alcorcon (Spain) in the first wave of the disease up to April 25, 2020. RESULTS: The crude cumulative incidence among migrants (n=20419) was higher than among Spaniards (n=131599): 8.81 and 6.51 and per 1000 inhabitants, respectively (p < .001), but differed by region of origin. As per a negative binomial regression adjusted for age and sex, relative risk (RR) for COVID-19 for individuals from Europe, Asia, or North Africa was not significantly different from Spaniards. In contrast, a markedly increased risk was found in people from Sub-Saharan Africa (RR 3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-9.41, p = .007), the Caribbean (RR 6.35, 95% CI 3.83-10.55, p < .001), and Latin America (RR 6.92, 95% CI 4.49-10.67, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America exhibited increased risk for COVID-19 as compared to Spaniards or migrants from Europe, North Africa, or Asia. Our data suggest ethnic background may play a role in risk for COVID-19. Migrants from some areas of the world may merit closer attention for both clinical and epidemiological reasons.","Guijarro, C; Pérez-Fernández, E; González-Piñeiro, B; Meléndez, V; Goyanes, M J; Renilla, Mª E; Casas, M L; Sastre, I; Velasco, M",Rev. clin. esp.

People in many nations have lost their livelihoods, it has severely impacted international relations and, most importantly, health infrastructures across the world have been tormented. This pandemic has already left footprints on human psychology, traits, and priorities and is certainly going to lead towards a new world order in the future. As always, science and technology have come to the rescue of the human race. The prevention of infection by instant and repeated cleaning of surfaces that are most likely to be touched in daily life and sanitization drives using medically prescribed sanitizers and UV irradiation of textiles are the first steps to breaking the chain of transmission. However, the real challenge is to develop and uplift medical infrastructure, such as diagnostic tools capable of prompt diagnosis and instant and economic medical treatment that is available to the masses. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, are atomic sheets that have been in the news for quite some time due to their unprecedented electronic mobilities, high thermal conductivity, appreciable thermal stability, excellent anchoring capabilities, optical transparency, mechanical flexibility, and a unique capability to integrate with arbitrary surfaces. These attributes of 2D materials make them lucrative for use as an active material platform for authentic and prompt (within minutes) disease diagnosis via electrical or optical diagnostic tools or via electrochemical diagnosis.

CF involves in the inflammatory processes and is considered as a multisystem disorder that is not confined to lungs, but it also affects other vital organs that leads to numerous co-morbidities. The respiratory disorder in the CF results in mortality and morbidity which is characterized by series of serious events involving mucus hypersecretion, microbial infections, airways obstruction, inflammation, destruction of epithelium, tissue remodeling and terminal lung diseases. Mucins are the high molecular weight glycoproteins important for the viscoelastic properties of the mucus, play a significant role in the disease mechanisms. Determining the functional association between the CFTR and mucins might help to identify the putative target for specific therapeutic approach. In fact, furin enzyme which helps in the entry of novel COVID-19 virus into the cell, is upregulated in CF and this can also serve as a potential target for CF treatment. Moreover, the use of nano-formulations for CF treatment is an area of research being widely studied as they have also demonstrated promising outcomes. The in-depth knowledge of non-coding RNAs like miRNAs and lncRNAs and their functional association with CFTR gene expression and mutation can provide a different range of opportunity to identify the promising therapeutic approaches for CF.","Kotnala, Sudhir; Dhasmana, Anupam; Kashyap, Vivek K; Chauhan, Subhash C; Yallapu, Murali M; Jaggi, Meena",Life Sci,601,16

COVID-19 has now spread worldwide to become a global pandemic affecting over 24 million people as of August 26th, 2020 and claimed the life of more than 800,000 people worldwide. COVID-19 is asymptomatic for some individuals and for others it can cause symptoms ranging from flu-like to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia and death. Although it is anticipated that an effective vaccine will be available to protect against COVID-19, at present the world is relying on social distancing and hygiene measures and repurposed drugs. There is a worldwide effort to develop an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and, as of late August 2020, there are 30 vaccines in clinical trials with over 200 in various stages of development. This review will focus on the eight vaccine candidates that entered Phase 1 clinical trials in mid-May, including AstraZeneca/Oxford's AZD1222, Moderna's mRNA-1273 and Sinovac's CoronaVac vaccines, which are currently in advanced stages of vaccine development. In addition to reviewing the different stages of vaccine development, vaccine platforms and vaccine candidates, this review also discusses the biological and immunological basis required of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the importance of a collaborative international effort, the ethical implications of vaccine development, the efficacy needed for an immunogenic vaccine, vaccine coverage, the potential limitations and challenges of vaccine development.

Patients’ opinions on teledermatology have already been analyzed, but a current analysis during the COVID‐19 pandemic is lacking. The purpose of this survey was to investigate the satisfaction of patients who had received dermatological advice via telephone during the COVID‐19 pandemic and to analyze their general opinion about eHealth as well as possible limitations for a broad implementation. Ninety‐one patients managed in the dermatology department using telephone consultation during the COVID‐19 pandemic were interviewed. An anonymous questionnaire, including the established quality of life questionnaire (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI]), was used. It was found that men were more satisfied with telephone consultations than women (p = 0.029), educational level and age did not correlate with satisfaction (p = 0.186 and 388, respectively), and the longer the waiting time for a telephone consultation, the lower the satisfaction (p = 0.001). Grouped analysis of all participants showed that the majority (54.0% n = 38/71) were “very happy” with the telephone consultation. Higher disease burden (DLQI) was associated with lower satisfaction (p = 0.042). The main stated reasons for using telemedicine were shorter waiting times (51.6% n = 47/91) and no travel requirement (57.1% n = 47/91). Almost one‐quarter (23.1% n = 21/89) of patients would use teledermatology in the future, 17.6% (n = 16/89) would not, and 57.1% (n = 51/89) would only use it in addition to a traditional consultation with personal contact. In conclusion, most patients in the study group still preferred traditional face‐to‐face medical consultations to telephone consultations, but also desired an add‐on telemedical tool. Dermatological care using more modern telemedicine technologies than telephone conferencing is needed to better address patients’ desires, especially in times of the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Pia‐Charlotte, Stadler Senner Sonja Frey Surina Benjamin M.

The COVID-19 pandemic has renewed interest in propolis products worldwide; fortunately, various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism are potential targets for propolis compounds. SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is characterized by viral spike protein interaction with cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2. This mechanism involves PAK1 overexpression, which is a kinase that mediates coronavirus-induced lung inflammation, fibrosis, and immune system suppression. Propolis components have inhibitory effects on the ACE2, TMPRSS2 and PAK1 signaling pathways; in addition, antiviral activity has been proven in vitro and in vivo. In pre-clinical studies, propolis promoted immunoregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including reduction in IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF-&#945;. This immunoregulation involves monocytes and macrophages, as well as Jak2/STAT3, NF-kB, and inflammasome pathways, reducing the risk of cytokine storm syndrome, a major mortality factor in advanced COVID-19 disease. Propolis has also shown promise as an aid in the treatment of various of the comorbidities that are particularly dangerous in COVID-19 patients, including respiratory diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. Standardized propolis products with consistent bioactive properties are now available. Given the current emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and limited therapeutic options, propolis is presented as a promising and relevant therapeutic option that is safe, easy to administrate orally and is readily available as a natural supplement and functional food.","Berretta, Andresa Aparecida; Silveira, Marcelo Augusto Duarte; Cóndor Capcha, José Manuel; De Jong, David",Biomed Pharmacother,601,24

The situation is likely to be more aggravated in developing and least developed countries struggling with the problem of ineffective waste disposal system, open defecation, poor sanitation, and limited access to clean drinking water. In this review, the available data on wastewater treatment, sanitation status and healthcare infrastructure from middle- and low-income countries is collected and correlated with the risk associated with the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The review also highlights the limitation of COVID-19 surveillance through sewage monitoring in these countries owing to the absence of proper sewerage system.

METHOD: The participants were 1037 nurses working in inpatient wards at 4 hospitals in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey approximately 6 months after the first COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: More than 90% of the 734 nurses participating in this study positively perceived the preventive effect of oral health care on aspiration pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and viral infection. However, approximately half of them had negative perceptions about their knowledge and confidence regarding the control of COVID-19 with oral health care provision, and 84.7% expected to be provided with the necessary information by oral health professionals. Further, 537 nurses (73.2%) provided oral health care to their patients; 9 nurses (1.7%) responded that those patients who received oral health care decreased after the lockdown; and 12 (2.4%) responded that they could no longer collaborate with oral health professionals because of the lockdown. Additionally, 41.7% of them used neither protective glasses nor face shields even after the lockdown began. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that almost all the nurses perceived the benefcial effect of oral health care for the prevention of viral infection and pneumonia. However, some nurses perceived that their oral health care provision and collaborative oral health care were negatively affected. It also showed that most nurses' knowledge, confidence, and use of infection control measures were insufficient. The results indicate that oral health professionals should support nurses in providing oral health care by providing them with information on COVID-19 infection control measures to prevent infection transmission.","Haresaku, Satoru; Aoki, Hisae; Kubota, Keiko; Nakashima, Fuyuko; Uchida, Souhei; Jinnouchi, Akio; Naito, Toru",Int. dent. j,601,1

Therefore, it is urgent to develop environmentally friendly and foliar affinity formulations. The design and construction of pesticide nano-delivery system is considered to be an effective way to solve this problem. RESULTS: In this research, polyamine-modified zein (AM-zein) were synthesized by incorporating ethylenediamine-terminated polyethyleneimine into zein to improve its stability as a nanocarrier, enhance electrostatic force between the carrier and pesticides and plant foliage. Avermectin-loaded nanoparticles, containing a high positive charge, was prepared by the anti-solvent method using AM-Zein as carrier. The nanoparticles can be stably stored for 30 days without any significant change in the particle size and stably dispersed at pH 5 - 9. Compared to the commercial emulsifiable concentrate (EC), nanoparticles dispersions exhibited better leaf affinity, and the retention of dispersion increased from 7.82 mg/cm2 to 13.86 mg/cm2 . Interestingly, we have discovered for the first time that the UV barrier effect of zein increases while prolonging the UV exposure time; 30.47% of the encapsulated AVM remained intact after exposure to UV for 60 min, compared to only 17.13% for the EC. Insecticidal activity of avermectin nanoparticles did not improve compared to EC, but they demonstrated significantly lower toxicity against zebrafish. CONCLUSION: This research opens up a new idea for improving the stability of zein nanoparticles, providing a novel path to deliver pesticides efficiently and eco-friendly.","Chen, Long; Lin, Yuanxiong; Zhou, Hongjun; Hao, Li; Chen, Huayao; Zhou, Xinhua",Pest manag. sci,601,20

However, the significant variability in the mortality rate across the world indicates some underlying factors, especially the immunity factors that may have a potential role in this variability. One such factor that is being discussed and tested is the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. The available evidence suggests that BCG vaccination provides broad protection against respiratory infections as well as other infections. Therefore, BCG may prove to be a barrier for COVID-19 infection and may offer a ray of hope. In this review, we contrasted BCG vaccination program with COVID-19 mortality and analyzed trained immunity and cross protection against unrelated pathogens due to BCG vaccination. On analyzing the available data, we observed that countries without universal BCG vaccination policy are severely affected, while countries having universal BCG policies are less affected. Based on these data, we propose that the SARS-CoV-2 related qualified immunity, cross protection against unrelated pathogens and COVID-19 impact variations could be partly explained by the different national policies regarding BCG childhood vaccination.

Although personal protective equipment (PPE) use is associated with lower infection rates, appropriate use of PPE has been variable among HCWs, even in settings with COVID-19 patients. We aimed to evaluate the patterns of PPE adherence during emergency department resuscitations that included an aerosol generating procedure (AGP). Methods We conducted a retrospective, video-based review of pediatric resuscitations involving one or more AGPs during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (March-June 2020). Recommended adherence (complete, inadequate, absent) with five PPE items (headwear, eyewear, masks, gowns, gloves) and the duration of potential exposure were evaluated for individuals in the room after AGP initiation. Results Among the 345 HCWs observed during 19 resuscitations, 306 (88.7%) were nonadherent (inadequate or absent) with recommended use of at least one PPE type at some time during the resuscitation, 23 (6.7%) of whom had no PPE. One hundred and forty HCWs (40.6%) altered or removed at least one type of PPE during the event. The aggregate time in the resuscitation room for HCWs across all events was 118.7 hours. During this time, providers had either absent or inadequate eyewear for 46.4 hours (39.1%) and masks for 35.2 hours (29.7%). Conclusions Full adherence with recommended PPE use was limited in a setting at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 virus aerosolization. In addition to ensuring appropriate donning, approaches are needed for ensuring ongoing adherence with PPE during exposure.","Alberto, Emily C.; McCarthy, Kathleen H.; Hamilton, Colleen A.; Shalkevich, Jacob Milestone Zachary P.; Izem, Rima Fritzeen Jennifer L.; Marsic, Ivan Sarcevic Aleksandra O’Connell Karen J.; Burd, Randall S.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,601,21

Throughout human history, experience has shown that prejudices and viruses spread simultaneously during a viral pandemic. Outgroup members have been associated with various diseases and non-human vectors of diseases. Some epidemics have been named according to various outgroups, just as the novel coronavirus has been referred to by some as the ""Wuhan virus"" or the ""Chinese virus."" Associating a virus with a sociodemographic group builds a false illusionary correlation, which can lead to stigmatization and discrimination. Pandemics can also stimulate violent xenophobic reactions. Besides the obvious harmful consequences for the individuals targeted, pandemic-related discrimination also affects the spread of the virus through its effect on public attitudes toward prevention and restriction, health service procurement, and in the establishment of health-related policies. It is important to first understand the relevant concepts and processes, and also to understand the underlying causes of discrimination in order to fight it. Social psychology offers multidimensional and comprehensive explanations of prejudice and discrimination. This review's primary aim was to examine the motivations behind COVID-19-related discrimination based on social psychological perspectives. In line with this aim, the review first defines discrimination in detail, plus the related concepts and main social psychological theories on prejudice and discrimination. Then, pandemic-related discrimination in light of past experiences is discussed and explanations put forward for the theoretical perspectives and inferences specific to COVID-19. Finally, recommendations are made in order to prevent and combat discrimination related to infectious diseases.","Demirtas-Madran, H Andaç",Front Psychol,601,32

We analyze confirmed infections and deaths over multiple geographic scales to show that COVID-19's impact is highly unequal: many subregions have nearly zero infections, and others are hot spots. We attribute the effect to a Reed-Hughes-like mechanism in which disease arrives at different times and grows exponentially. Hot spots, however, appear to grow faster than neighboring subregions and dominate spatially aggregated statistics, thereby amplifying growth rates. The staggered spread of COVID-19 can also make aggregated growth rates appear higher even when subregions grow at the same rate.

A common issue in all of these crises seems to be the issue of ""trust."" Official authorities, including the Iranian President, ministers, and the judiciary system, tried to gain people's trust by either changing policies or developing new ones. In August 2019, the new law on crisis management in Iran went into effect and the issue of public donation has been considered, too. Also, in their response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Iranian officials ordered all sectors to cooperate with the Ministry of Health and provide it with all necessary facilities. Therefore, it seems that new policies are still needed to overcome mistrust in Iran at times of emergency. Developing a policy on donation management was the first step, and there are several factors that could have contributed to the perception of the mistrust and failure in emergency missions. Mistrust can be the result of different causes, including but not limited to lack of knowledge on capabilities and efficiencies of humanitarian organizations, engagement of a wide range of organizations from different categories, extension of mistrust of an organization to other emergency organizations in the area or all of operation, lack of unity in emergency response, and poor public relations.","Seddighi, Hamed",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,601,1

Though unequivocally beneficial for biodiversity, gazetting land for protecting nature can also be seen as an 'opportunity cost' that some politicians are unwilling to pay. One of the most effective strategies to increase the political resilience of PAs in the face of such threats is to demonstrate their broader value to society. This is one of the objectives of the recently proposed 'PA asset framework'. The framework conceptualizes PAs as being composed of suites of biophysical, human, infrastructure, institutional and cultural assets that interact with individuals and institutions to generate different forms of tangible and intangible value. Here, we test the utility of the framework by conducting an asset-based analysis of Brazilian National Parks (NPs) at two different scales (NP system and NP unit). Assets were identified at the system level through a systematic review of 49 Management Plans (MPs) using a typology of PA asset classes as a tool for characterising the presence and state of assets in or associated with NPs. At the NP unit level, assets were identified through semi-structured interviews with local managers of the Chapada Diamantina National Park. Biophysical and infrastructure assets were the most represented asset classes at both scales. Our analysis successfully revealed: (i) which assets can be managed to generate wider forms of values at local scale (e.g. natural spectacles, iconic species, park volunteers) (ii) relational values between assets (e.g. trails and outdoor recreational features), and (iii) value generating practices (VGPs) to capture values from the interaction between different assets (i.e. restoration of degraded areas through voluntary programmes, etc.). We conclude by discussing how the PA asset framework can be operatively integrated into NP management to improve the future allocation of limited financial resources.","Bragagnolo, Chiara; Correia, Ricardo A; Gamarra, Norah Costa; Lessa, Thainá; Jepson, Paul; Malhado, Ana C M; Ladle, Richard J",J Environ Manage,601,1

Results: Our model-based crude CFR fitted the observed data well throughout the course of the epidemic except for the very early stage in Gyeongsangbuk-do; this was partially due to the reporting delay.

Thereafter, labels of Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) in Europe and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in the USA were coined to refer to this new disease entity. The reality is that PIMS-TS/MIS-C resembles certain KD complications such as toxic shock syndrome and macrophage activation syndrome than to classic KD. PIMS-TS/MIS-C and KD share the viral origin (however just supposed for KD) and consequent dysregulated innate immune system inflammatory reaction. PIMS-TS/MISC symptoms occur about 2-4 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 or having been exposed to somebody positive for COVID-19, rather than in the acute phase of the infection. Clinically PIMS-TS/MIS-C affects older children than KD and presents more often with gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and multi-organ dysfunction. myocarditis is more common in PIMS-TS/MIS-C than coronary artery aneurysms formation seen in KD. There are also differences in laboratory tests and immunology responses in KD and PIMS-TS/MIS-C. Thus PIMS-TS/MIS-C seems to be a new and multifaceted entity, distinct from KD, notwithstanding some common features in both. The dysregulated innate immune system reaction is responsible for PIMS-TS/MIS-C onset and outcome.

Clinical manifestations included fever in four cases, respiratory symptoms in three cases, febrile convulsions in one case, vomiting in one case, abdominal pain in one case, and asymptomatic infection in two cases. All the children tested positive for nucleic acid in throat swabs at admission. Stool swabs of three cases were positive for nucleic acid after several days of fever. In nine children, blood routine results were normal, whereas in one case the white blood cell count was elevated. In four cases, CT findings of the lungs showed light ground-glass opacities, one case showed changes similar to bronchopneumonia, and the remaining cases were normal. All were treated with symptomatic support without complications. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that intrafamily transmission may be the main form of transmission of COVID-19 in children, and persistent intestinal excretion of virus is another characteristic among children. The results of stool swab tests should be considered for discharge and release from isolation.","Tan, Yu-Pin; Tan, Bo-Yu; Pan, Jia; Wu, Jing; Zeng, Sai-Zhen; Wei, Hong-Yan",J Clin Virol,601,16
229592,229592,229592,No Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on Urethral Swab in Patients with Positive Nasopharyngeal Swab,10.782885,10.4881,2020,"In this work, the degradation of chloroquine (CLQ), an antiviral and antimalarial drug, using electro-Fenton oxidation was investigated. Due to the importance of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation during electro-Fenton oxidation, effects of pH, current density, molecular oxygen (O2) flow rate, and anode material on H2O2 generation were evaluated. H2O2 generation was enhanced by increasing the current density up to 60 mA/cm2 and the O2 flow rate up to 80 mL/min at pH 3.0 and using carbon felt cathode and boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode. Electro-Fenton-BDD oxidation achieved the total CLQ depletion and 92% total organic carbon (TOC) removal. Electro-Fenton-BDD oxidation was more effective than electro-Fenton-Pt and anodic oxidation using Pt and BDD anodes. The efficiency of CLQ depletion by electro-Fenton-BDD oxidation raises by increasing the current density and Fe2+ dose; however it drops with the increase of pH and CLQ concentration. CLQ depletion follows a pseudo-first order kinetics in all the experiments. The identification of CLQ degradation intermediates by chromatography methods confirms the formation of 7-chloro-4-quinolinamine, oxamic, and oxalic acids. Quantitative amounts of chlorides, nitrates, and ammonium ions are released during electro-Fenton oxidation of CLQ. The high efficiency of electro-Fenton oxidation derives from the generation of hydroxyl radicals from the catalytic decomposition of H2O2 by Fe2+ in solution, and the electrogeneration of hydroxyl and sulfates radicals and other strong oxidants (persulfates) from the oxidation of the electrolyte at the surface BDD anode. Electro-Fenton oxidation has the potential to be an alternative method for treating wastewaters contaminated with CLQ and its derivatives.","Midassi, Sondos; Bedoui, Ahmed; Bensalah, Nasr",Chemosphere,601,24

Diagnostic autopsy, although useful for cause of death identification, have limited acceptance. Minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) is an alternative to autopsy for identification of the cause of death (CoD). A formative research linked to pilot MITS implementation was conducted to document the perceptions and attitudes of the healthcare professionals and the barriers for implementation. METHODS: This exploratory qualitative study conducted at a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India included the hospital staffs. In-depth interviews were conducted with the doctors, nurses and support staffs from pediatrics, neonatology, obstetrics and forensic medicine departments. Inductive data analysis was done to identify the emerging themes and codes. RESULTS: A total of 26 interviews (doctors, n = 10; nurses, n = 9 and support staffs, n = 7) were conducted. Almost all professional and support staffs were positive about the MITS and its advantage for CoD identification including co-existing and underlying illnesses. Some opined conduct of MITS for the cases without clear diagnosis. All participants perceived that MITS would be acceptable for parents due to the non-disfigurement and preferred by those who had unexplained child deaths or stillbirths in past. The key factors for MITS acceptance were appropriate communication, trust building, involvement of senior doctors, and engagement of the counselor prior to deaths and training of the personnel. For implementation and sustenance of MITS, involvement of the institute authority and government stakeholders would be essential. CONCLUSIONS: MITS was acceptable for the doctors, nurses and support staffs and critical for better identification of the causes of death and stillbirths. The key facilitating factors and challenges for implementing MITS at the hospital in Indian context were identified. It emphasized on appropriate skill building, counseling, system organization and buy-in from institution and health authorities for sustenance of MITS.","Das, Manoja Kumar; Arora, Narendra Kumar; Rasaily, Reeta; Kaur, Gurkirat; Malik, Prikanksha; Kumari, Mahisha; Joshi, Shipra; Chellani, Harish; Gaekwad, Harsha; Debata, Pradeep; Meena, K R",BMC Health Serv Res,601,20

Microcapsules containing these encapsulates are readily produced at room temperature in the form of alginate beads that are stabilized by an outer shell consisting of an ultra thin chitosan-calcium phosphate membrane. Modulation of the shell thickness and composition influences the rates of release and diffusion of encapsulated cells, growth factors and genes to produce microcapsules with tailored spatial and temporal properties that offer significant potential as novel biomimetic delivery systems in tissue engineering applications such as skeletal tissue repair and regeneration. We demonstrate the use of mineralized microcapsules to enable regeneration from encapsulated human mesenchymal populations, functional quantities of growth factor capture, and gene transfection. Significantly, we highlight the ability to fabricate integrated capsules consisting of spatially separated multiple components in nested combination that may provide phased temporal release of appropriate growth factors, analogous to the natural regeneration process.","Green, David W; Mann, Stephen; Oreffo, Richard O C",Soft Matter,601,20

We obtain the Euler angles by solving the post-Newtonian precession equations expanded to (next-to)$^4$ leading (second post-Newtonian) order and use them in the waveform mode rotations to extend non-precessing \texttt{TEOBResumS} waveforms to generic spin configurations. The scheme is compared to current state-of-the-art precessing approximants \texttt{NRSur7dq4} and \texttt{SEOBNRv4PHM} in terms of frequency-domain matches of the $\ell=2$ gravitational-wave strain for 200 and 1100 binaries, respectively, with the initial gravitational-wave frequencies between 20 and 50 Hz and the precessing spin parameter $\chi_p$ ranging up to one.

The largest disagreements occur for large mass ratios and for large spin components along the orbital plane quantified in terms of a new parameter, $S_{\perp,\text{max}}$, that we introduce. The disagreements stem from Euler-rotating non-precessing waveforms with constant spins, which can be replaced by time-varying $z$-components of spins.

Our aim was to determine the value of incorporating a chest computed tomography (CT) scan during acute stroke imaging, and the factors that influence this decision. METHODS: We constructed a probabilistic decision tree of the value of acquiring a chest CT scan or not, expressed in quality-adjusted life months (QALM) of patients and medical professionals. The model was based on the chance of detecting infection by chest CT scan, the case fatality rates of COVID-19 infection, the risk of COVID-19 infection after exposure, the expected proportion of medical professionals exposed, and the exposure reduction derived from early disease detection. RESULTS: The decision to incorporate the chest CT scan was superior to not doing so (12.00 QALM vs 11.99 QALM, respectively), when the probability of patients having undetected COVID-19 infection is 3.5%, potentially exposing 100% of medical professionals, and if early detection reduces exposure by 50%. The risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 infection following exposure casts uncertainty on the results, but this is offset by the potential for reducing exposure. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a measurable benefit of incorporating a chest CT into the urgent imaging protocol of acute stroke patients in reducing exposure of medical professionals without appropriate precautions. The clinical impact of this benefit, however, may not be materially significant.","Qureshi, Adnan I; French, Brandi R; Siddiq, Farhan; Arora, Niraj A; Nattanmai, Premkumar; Gomez, Camilo R",J Neuroimaging,601,16

Subjective childbirth experience is influenced not only by characteristics of the childbirth itself but also by maternal characteristics. A maternal characteristic that may be associated with a more positive childbirth experience is trait mindfulness. The current study aimed to assess this association and to assess whether trait mindfulness during pregnancy had a moderating role in the possible association between non-spontaneous delivery and perception of childbirth. A subsample of 486 women, participating in a longitudinal prospective cohort study (Holistic Approach to Pregnancy and the first Postpartum Year study), completed the Three Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form at 22 weeks of pregnancy. Women completed the Childbirth Perception Scale and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale between 7 and 21 days postpartum. The mindfulness facets acting with awareness and non-reacting were significantly associated with a more positive perception of childbirth, after adjusting for covariates. Moderation analyses showed a significant interaction between acting with awareness and non-spontaneous delivery and non-judging and non-spontaneous delivery. Non-spontaneous delivery was associated with a more negative perception of childbirth for low/medium scores of acting with awareness and non-judging, but not for high scores on these mindfulness facets. Trait mindfulness during pregnancy may enhance a positive perception of childbirth. Because this is among the first studies examining the association between maternal dispositional mindfulness and perception of childbirth, future research is needed to confirm the results of the current study.","Hulsbosch, Lianne P; Boekhorst, Myrthe G B M; Potharst, Eva S; Pop, Victor J M; Nyklícek, Ivan",,601,24

To confirm this observation this paper proposes to evaluate the impact of COVID-19, and more generally of crises that lead to a sharp drop in traffic, on the pilot/controller system, especially during the critical approach and landing phases. To study the influence of this type of crisis on flight operations at Charles De Gaulle airport, an existing energy atypicality metric is applied on a reference period before COVID-19 and compared to the COVID-19 period. Whereas the traffic at Charles De Gaulle airport has decreased by around 90% on April 2020, the obtained statistics underlined an increase in the atypical flight ratio of around 50%. This trend can be explained in part by the appearance of glide interceptions from above as a result of trajectory shortenings, and an increase in the proportion of high speed approaches.","Jarry, Gabriel; Delahaye, Daniel; Feron, Eric",Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,601,16

In addition, there remains an ever-increasing need to quantitatively evaluate the immune response to develop vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. Here, we report an analytical method for the rapid and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in human serum by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). A recombinant SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) protein labeled with HiLyte Fluor 647 (F-RBD) was prepared and used for FPIA. When the anti-RBD antibody in human serum binds to F-RBD, the degree of polarization (P) increases by suppressing the rotational diffusion of F-RBD. The measurement procedure required only mixing a reagent containing F-RBD with serum sample and measuring the P value with a portable fluorescence polarization analyzer after 15 min incubation. We evaluated analytical performance of the developed FPIA system using 30 samples: 20 COVID-19 positive sera and 10 negative sera. The receiver operating characteristic curve drawn with the obtained results showed that this FPIA system had high accuracy for discriminating COVID-19 positive or negative serum (AUC = 0.965). The total measurement time was about 20 min, and the serum volume required for measurement was 0.25 µL. Therefore, we successfully developed the FPIA system that enables rapid and easy quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibody. It is believed that our FPIA system will facilitate rapid on-site identification of infected persons and deepen understanding of the immune response to COVID-19.","Nishiyama, Keine; Takahashi, Kazuki; Fukuyama, Mao; Kasuya, Motohiro; Imai, Ayuko; Usukura, Takumi; Maishi, Nako; Maeki, Masatoshi; Ishida, Akihiko; Tani, Hirofumi; Hida, Kyoko; Shigemura, Koji; Hibara, Akihide; Tokeshi, Manabu",Biosens Bioelectron,601,16

Viral shedding measured from nasal and throat swabs, bronchoalveolar lavages, and tissues was not reduced with baricitinib. Type I interferon (IFN) antiviral responses and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses remained similar between the two groups. Animals treated with baricitinib showed reduced inflammation, decreased lung infiltration of inflammatory cells, reduced NETosis activity, and more limited lung pathology. Importantly, baricitinib-treated animals had a rapid and remarkably potent suppression of lung macrophage production of cytokines and chemokines responsible for inflammation and neutrophil recruitment. These data support a beneficial role for, and elucidate the immunological mechanisms underlying, the use of baricitinib as a frontline treatment for inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hoang, Timothy N; Pino, Maria; Boddapati, Arun K; Viox, Elise G; Starke, Carly E; Upadhyay, Amit A; Gumber, Sanjeev; Nekorchuk, Michael; Busman-Sahay, Kathleen; Strongin, Zachary; Harper, Justin L; Tharp, Gregory K; Pellegrini, Kathryn L; Kirejczyk, Shannon; Zandi, Keivan; Tao, Sijia; Horton, Tristan R; Beagle, Elizabeth N; Mahar, Ernestine A; Lee, Michelle Y H; Cohen, Joyce; Jean, Sherrie M; Wood, Jennifer S; Connor-Stroud, Fawn; Stammen, Rachelle L; Delmas, Olivia M; Wang, Shelly; Cooney, Kimberly A; Sayegh, Michael N; Wang, Lanfang; Filev, Peter D; Weiskopf, Daniela; Silvestri, Guido; Waggoner, Jesse; Piantadosi, Anne; Kasturi, Sudhir P; Al-Shakhshir, Hilmi; Ribeiro, Susan P; Sekaly, Rafick P; Levit, Rebecca D; Estes, Jacob D; Vanderford, Thomas H; Schinazi, Raymond F; Bosinger, Steven E; Paiardini, Mirko",Cell,601,20

The potential causes of coagulopathy are inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis. The thrombotic events including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis as well as intracatheter thrombosis are more likely to develop in patients infected with severe form of SARS-CoV-2 who are admitted to ICU. Furthermore, these events contribute to multi-organ failure. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a case of an immunocompromised COVID-19 elderly patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia who developed myocardial infarction with ST elevation in the setting of acute pulmonary thromboembolism in the presence of zero platelet count. Despite successful urgent coronary revascularization and platelet transfusion, the patient eventually died after failed resuscitation efforts. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 infection are at a greater risk of developing cardiovascular complications, but their appropriate management can decrease the risk of fatal events. Coronary thrombosis associated with pulmonary thromboembolism in the setting of thrombocytopenia is a rare and a complex to manage condition. Significance of single antiplatelet agent in STEMI with thrombocytopenia merits further studies. According to expert opinions and literature reviews, we must avoid dual antiplatelet therapy in these patients and keep platelet transfusion as a standard therapy to avoid drastic bleeding complications.","Hashemi, Arash; Gerges, Fady; Naqvi, Haseeb Raza; Kotlar, Irina; Moscatelli, Sara; Hashemi, Ashkan; Rustamova, Yasmin; Almaghraby, Abdallah",Egypt Heart J,601,16

METHODS: The evaluations were carried out by means of an online survey, with a sample of 3480 persons in the first data collection and 1041 and 569 persons in the successive evaluation periods. The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated by means of screening tests. Sociodemographic data, Covid-19 variables, loneliness, psychological well-being, social support, discrimination and a sense of belonging, were collected. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms increased significantly throughout the confinement, decreasing at the last assessment but not dropping to previous levels. In anxiety, there are no significant changes between the three evaluations, but a downward trend can be seen over time. Regarding the symptomatology of PTSD, a downward trend is observed throughout the three evaluations, with significantly lower scores between the first and third assessments. The different regression models developed reveal the importance of perceived loneliness and spiritual well-being as the main predictors of mental health, as well as the importance of the lower age for depression and the female gender for anxiety and PSTD. CONCLUSIONS: This research shows that the pandemic has had a negative impact on our mental health, which still does not seem to be at pre-crisis levels, although it has improved as the emergency situation subsides. These results underline the importance of paying greater attention to mental health, and reveal key variables such as spiritual well-being and perceived loneliness in which to intervene from different care services, as well as younger people and women as vulnerable groups on which to focus more attention.","González-Sanguino, C; Ausín, B; Castellanos, M A; Saiz, J; Muñoz, M",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,601,16

Air pollution also contributes to co-morbidities that are known to worsen outcomes amongst those infected with COVID-19, and air pollution may also enhance infection transmission due to its impact on more frequent coughing. Yet despite the massive disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are reasons for optimism: broad societal lockdowns have shown us a glimpse of what a future with strong air pollution measures could yield. Thus, the urgency to combat air pollution is not diminished, but instead heightened in the context of the pandemic.","Brauer, Michael; Casadei, Barbara; Harrington, Robert A; Kovacs, Richard; Sliwa, Karen",J.

Scrupulous blood sugar management is crucial, since the worse outcomes are closely associated with higher blood sugar levels in COVID-19 infection. Although recent observational studies showed that insulin was associated with mortality, it should not deter insulin use in hospitalized patients requiring tight glucose control. Back and forth dilemma in the past with regards to continue/discontinue certain medications used in diabetes have been mostly resolved. The initial fears of consequences related to continuing certain medications have been largely dispelled. COVID-19 also necessitates the transformation in diabetes care through the integration of technologies. Recent advances in health-related technologies, notably telemedicine and remote continuous glucose monitoring, have become essential in the management of diabetes during the pandemic. Today, these technologies have changed the landscape of medicine and become more important than ever. Being a high-risk population, patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, should be prioritized for vaccination.

Ultimately, it is plausible that the human impact on the biosphere could be the root cause of these emerging diseases, and that economic globalization, population growth and landscape anthropization might increase the likelihood of the emergence of novel zoonoses. This pattern bears similarities to phenomena that occurred during the Neolithic period with the emergence of agriculture and cattle domestication. Still today such phenomena could be accelerated by the vastly increased traffic of people and goods. Finally, we argue in favour of strong policies and actions aiming to mitigate the human impact on natural ecosystems as a key strategy to prevent future zoonoses. © 2021 Sciendo.

Here, we present gene-to-gene regulatory networks in response to SARS-CoV-2 using a Bayesian network. We examined the dynamic changes in the SARS-CoV-2-purturbated networks established by our proposed framework for gene network analysis, thus revealing that interferon signaling gradually switched to the subsequent inflammatory cytokine signaling cascades. Furthermore, we succeeded in capturing a COVID-19 patient-specific network in which transduction of these signals was concurrently induced. This enabled us to explore the local regulatory systems influenced by SARS-CoV-2 in host cells more precisely at an individual level.

The objective of this study was to determine the early effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical care of patients with cleft lip and/or palate at a high-volume cleft center. Methods: A retrospective comparative cohort study of patients with cleft lip and/or palate undergoing lip adhesion, cleft lip and nose repair, and palatoplasty before and during the pandemic was conducted. There were 50 patients in the prepandemic cohort and 53 in the pandemic cohort. Results: Mean age at lip adhesion was 3.1 +/- 1.1 months prepandemic (n = 8) and 3.5 +/- 2.5 months in the pandemic cohort (n = 8) (P = 0.75). One lip adhesion was delayed by 1.6 months. Mean age at cleft lip and nose repair was 6.6 +/- 1.9 months prepandemic (n = 23) and 8.0 +/- 2.1 months in the pandemic cohort (n = 23) (P = 0.03). Six pandemic cleft lip and nose repairs were delayed;the mean delay was 2.6 +/- 1.8 months.

Due to the lack of anti-COVID-19 therapies, decision-makers require timely and accurate data to estimate the incidence of disease and the availability of hospital resources to contain the pandemic. Methods: We adapted an existing model to the local context to forecast COVID-19 incidence and hospital resource use assuming different scenarios: (1) the implementation of quarantine from September 1st to October 15th (average daily growth rate of 2%); (2-3) partial restrictions (at 4% and 8% growth rates); and (4) no restrictions, assuming a 10% growth rate. Previous scenarios with predictions from June to August were also presented. We estimated the number of new cases, diagnostic tests required, and the number of available hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds (with and without ventilators) for each scenario. Results: We estimated 67,700 cases by October 15th when assuming the implementation of a quarantine, 80,400 and 101,500 cases when assuming partial restrictions at 4% and 8% infection rates, respectively, and 208,500 with no restrictions. According to different scenarios, the estimated demand for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests ranged from 202,000 to 1,610,600 between September 1st and October 15th. The model predicted depletion of hospital and ICU beds by September 20th if all restrictions were to be lifted and the infection growth rate increased to 10%. Conclusion: Slowly lifting social distancing restrictions and reopening the economy is not expected to result in full resource depletion by October if the daily growth rate is maintained below 8%. Increasing the number of available beds provides a safeguard against slightly higher infection rates. Predictive models can be iteratively used to obtain nuanced predictions to aid decision-making.","Iragorri, Nicolas; Gómez-Restrepo, Carlos; Barrett, Kali; Herrera, Socrates; Hurtado, Isabel; Khan, Yasin; Mac, Stephen; Naimark, David; Pechlivanoglou, Petros; Rosselli, Diego; Toro, Dilian; Villamizar, Pedro; Ximenes, Raphael; Zapata, Helmer; Sander, Beate",Colomb Med (Cali),601,24

The paleopathological evidence of TB attests the presence of the disease starting from Neolithic times. Traditionally, it was thought that TB has a zoonotic origin, being acquired by humans from cattle during the Neolithic revolution. However, the biomolecular studies proposed a new evolutionary scenario demonstrating that human TB has a human origin. The researches show that the disease was present in the early human populations of Africa at least 70000 years ago and that it expanded following the migrations of Homo sapiens out of Africa, adapting to the different human groups. The demographic success of TB during the Neolithic period was due to the growth of density and size of the human host population, and not the zoonotic transfer from cattle, as previously hypothesized. These data demonstrate a long coevolution of the disease and its human host. Understanding the changes of TB through time thanks to the advances in the field of paleopathology can help to solve the present problems and understand the future evolution of TB.","Buzic, I; Giuffra, V",J Prev Med Hyg,601,16

TRIAL DESIGN: Two separate multi-centre placebo-controlled parallel group randomized trials PARTICIPANTS: (1) Health care personnel working in the hospital or ambulance service where they will take care of patients with the COVID-19 infection and (2) elderly &#8805;60 years. The HCW trial is being undertaken in 9 hospitals. The elderly trial is being undertaken in locations in the community in Nijmegen, Utrecht, and Veghel, in the Netherlands, using senior citizen organisations to facilitate recruitment. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: For both trials the intervention group will be randomized to vaccination with 0.1 ml of the licensed BCG vaccine (Danish strain 1331, SSI, Denmark, equivalent to 0.075 mg attenuated M. bovis). The placebo group consists of 0.1 ml 0.9% NaCl, which is the same amount, and has the same colour and appearance as the suspended BCG vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES: (1) Number of days of unplanned work absenteeism in HCWs for any reason which can be continuously measured on a bi-weekly basis, and (2) the cumulative incidence of hospital admission due to documented COVID-19. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be randomized to BCG vaccine or placebo (1;1) centrally using a computer- based system, stratified by study centre. BLINDING (MASKING): Subjects, investigators, physicians and outcome assessors are blinded for the intervention. Only the pharmacist assistant that prepares- and research personnel that administers- study medicines are unblinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): (1) The sample size for the first trial is N=1500 HCWs randomised 1:1 to either BCG vaccine (n=750) and placebo (n=750) and (2) The sample size for the second trial is N=1600 elderly persons randomised to BCG vaccine (n=800) and the placebo group (n=800).

THE PURPOSE: The routine screening-based multiyear retrospective observational study of prevalence and circulation patterns of epidemic-prone human coronaviruses in Moscow. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect RNA of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in nasal and throat swabs from 16,511 patients with an acute respiratory infection (ARI), aged 1 month to 95 years (children accounted for 58.3%) from January 2016 to March 2020, and swabs from 505 relatively healthy children in 2008, 2010 and 2011. Results. HCoVs were yearly found in 2.6-6.1% of the examined patients; the detection frequency was statistically higher in adults than in children, regardless of sex. At the height of the disease incidence in December 2019, HCoVs were detected in 13.7% of the examined, demonstrating a two-fold increase as compared to the multi-year average for that month. The statistical frequency of HCoV detection in ARI pediatric patients under 6 years was significantly higher than in their healthy peers (3.7 vs 0.7%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: HCoVs circulate annually, demonstrating a winter-spring seasonal activity pattern in the Moscow Region and reaching peak levels in December. Over the years of observation, the HCoV epidemic activity reached maximum levels in December 2019-February 2020 and decreased in March to the multi-year average. Amid a growing number of SARS-CoV-2 cases imported to Moscow in March 2020, the HCoV detection frequency dropped sharply, which can be explained by the competition between different coronaviruses and by the specificity of HCoV detection with the diagnostic test kit used in this study.","Yatsyshina, S B; Mamoshina, M V; Shipulina, O Yu; Podkolzin, A T; Akimkin, V G",Vopr Virusol,601,24

Low trust in vaccines is attributed to a combination of factors, including lack of understanding, vaccine scares, flawed policies, social media and mistrust of vaccine manufacturers, scientists and decision-makers. The COVID-19 crisis has laid bare societies' vulnerability to new pathogens and the critical role of vaccines (and their acceptability) in containing this and future pandemics. It has also put science at the forefront of the response, with several governments relying on academics to help shape policy and communicate with the public. Against this backdrop, protecting public trust in scientists and scientific output is arguably more important than ever. Yet, conflicts of interest (CoI) in biomedical research remain ubiquitous and harmful, and measures to curb them have had limited success. There is also evidence of bias in industry-sponsored vaccine studies and academics are voicing concerns about the risks of working in a CoI prevalent research area. Here, we set out to challenge established thinking with regard to vaccine confidence, by shifting the gaze from a deficit in public understanding towards probity in research relationships and suggesting an alternative and perhaps complementary strategy for addressing vaccine mistrust. We argue that a concerted effort needs to be made to revisit the norms that undergird contemporary vaccine research, coupled with a willingness of all stakeholders to reimagine those relationships with an emphasis on demonstrating trustworthiness and probity.","Wheelock, Ana; Ives, Jonathan",J. med. ethics,601,9

Objective: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are the key proteins for 2019-nCoV entry into host cells. To evaluate the potential infection risk of 2019-nCoV on ocular surface, we compared ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression among different eye tissues. Methods: Experimental study. Thirty mice were assigned to male, female, aged, diabetic and non-diabetic groups, with 6 mice in each group. Real-time PCR was performed to quantify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in conjunctiva, cornea, lacrimal gland, iris, lens, retina, lung, heart, kidney, and liver from male mice. Immunohistochemistry staining was applied to visualize the distribution of the two proteins in different mice tissues, and in human corneal and conjunctival sections. Published transcriptome datasets were extracted to generate the expression comparasion of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 between human conjunctival and corneal tissues, and results were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test. Female mice, aged mice, STZ-induced diabetic mice, diabetic group control mice were also subjected to ACE2 expression analysis. Results were analyzed using Student's t-test. Results: The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes were the highest in conjunctiva among all the six mice eye tissues explored. The expression of these two genes in conjunctiva were lower than that in kidney and lung. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 shared similar expression pattern with the staining concentrated in corneal epithelium, conjunctival epithelium and lacrimal gland serous cells. The expression levels of ACE2 showed gender difference. Female mice had lower ACE2 in conjunctiva and cornea than male mice, with the expression levels being only 43% (t=3.269, P=0.031) and 63% (t=4.080, P=0.015) of that in the male conjunctiva and cornea, respectively. Diabetic mice expressed more ACE2 in conjunctiva (1.21-fold, P>0.05) and lacrimal gland (1.10-fold, P>0.05) compared with the control group. No significant difference on ACE2 expression was found between the aged and young adult mice. The expression level of human conjunctiva ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were significantly higher than that in the cornea (P=0.007), with 5.74-fold and 12.84-fold higher in the conjunctiva than in the corneal epithelium cells, which resembled the situation in mice. Conclusion: The observation of high-level ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in conjunctiva among the 6 eye tissues examined suggests that conjunctiva serves as an infection target tissue of 2019-nCoV.

This review aimed to synthesize the remission and recurrence rates following TSS for CD and identify predictors of these outcomes. METHODS: Medline (1946-) and Embase (1947-) were searched until 23rd January 2019 for original studies. A meta-analysis was performed of remission and recurrence rates. Studies were excluded if patients had prior radiosurgery/radiotherapy, mixed pathologies or interventions without separated data, follow-up not reported or population size < 20. For recurrence rate syntheses, studies with follow-up < 6 months were excluded. RESULTS: The search produced 2663 studies, of which n = 68 were included, involving 5664 patients. Remission rates after primary and revision TSS were 80% [77-82] and 58% [50-66] at last follow-up. After primary TSS, predictors of remission were micro- v macroadenomas (83% v 68%, p < 0.01), imaging-visible adenomas (81% v 69%, p < 0.01), adenomas confirmed on histopathology (87% v 45%, p < 0.01), absence of cavernous sinus invasion (80% v 30%, p < 0.01), postoperative serum cortisol (MSeC) nadir < 2 µg/dL (< 55 nmol/L; 95% v 46%, p < 0.01) and lower preoperative 24-h urine free cortisol (1250 nmol v 1726 nmol, p < 0.01). For revision TSS, predictors of remission were postoperative MSeC nadir < 2 µg/dL (< 55 nmol/L; 100% v 38%, p < 0.01) and operations for recurrence v persistence (80% v 54%, p < 0.01). Recurrence rates after primary and revision TSS were 18% [14-22] and 28% [16-42]. CONCLUSIONS: TSS is most effective in primary microadenomas, visible on preoperative imaging and without CS invasion, lower preoperative 24-h urine free cortisol and postoperative MSeC nadir < 2 µg/dL (< 55 nmol/L).","Stroud, Anna; Dhaliwal, Pearl; Alvarado, Raquel; Winder, Mark J; Jonker, Benjamin P; Grayson, Jessica W; Hamizan, Aneeza; Harvey, Richard J; McCormack, Ann",Pituitary,601,16

As usage rates for platelets are highly variable, the effective management of platelet demand and supply is very important yet challenging. The primary goal of this paper is to present an efficient forecasting model for platelet demand at Canadian Blood Services (CBS). To accomplish this goal, four different demand forecasting methods, ARIMA (Auto Regressive Moving Average), Prophet, lasso regression (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are utilized and evaluated. We use a large clinical dataset for a centralized blood distribution centre for four hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario, spanning from 2010 to 2018 and consisting of daily platelet transfusions along with information such as the product specifications, the recipients' characteristics, and the recipients' laboratory test results. This study is the first to utilize different methods from statistical time series models to data-driven regression and a machine learning technique for platelet transfusion using clinical predictors and with different amounts of data. We find that the multivariate approaches have the highest accuracy in general, however, if sufficient data are available, a simpler time series approach such as ARIMA appears to be sufficient. We also comment on the approach to choose clinical indicators (inputs) for the multivariate models.","Motamedi, Maryam; Li, Na; Down, Douglas G.; Heddle, Nancy M.",,601,30

In multi-region areas such as Italy, where the contagion peak has been reached, it is crucial to find targeted and coordinated optimal exit and restarting strategies on a regional basis to effectively cope with possible onset of further epidemic waves, while efficiently returning the economic activities to their standard level of intensity. Differently from the related literature, where modeling and controlling the pandemic contagion is typically addressed on a national basis, this paper proposes an optimal control approach that supports governments in defining the most effective strategies to be adopted during post-lockdown mitigation phases in a multi-region scenario. Based on the joint use of a non-linear Model Predictive Control scheme and a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)-based epidemiological model, the approach is aimed at minimizing the cost of the so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (that is, mitigation strategies), while ensuring that the capacity of the network of regional healthcare systems is not violated. In addition, the proposed approach supports policy makers in taking targeted intervention decisions on different regions by an integrated and structured model, thus both respecting the specific regional health systems characteristics and improving the system-wide performance by avoiding uncoordinated actions of the regions. The methodology is tested on the COVID-19 outbreak data related to the network of Italian regions, showing its effectiveness in properly supporting the definition of effective regional strategies for managing the COVID-19 diffusion.","Carli, Raffaele; Cavone, Graziana; Epicoco, Nicola; Scarabaggio, Paolo; Dotoli, Mariagrazia",Annual reviews in control,601,20

PURPOSE: This study will describe the occupational and personal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on oncologist well-being and patient care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four virtual focus groups were conducted with US ASCO member oncologists (September-November 2020). Inquiry and subsequent discussions centered on self-reported accounts of professional and personal COVID-19 experiences affecting well-being, and oncologist recommendations for well-being interventions that the cancer organization and professional societies (ASCO) might implement were explored. Qualitative interviews were analyzed using Framework Analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-five oncologists were interviewed: median age 44 years (range: 35-69 years), 52% female, 52% racial or ethnic minority, 76% medical oncologists, 64% married, and an average of 51.5 patients seen per week (range: 20-120). Five thematic consequences emerged: (1) impact of pre-COVID-19 burnout, (2) occupational or professional limitations and adaptations, (3) personal implications, (4) concern for the future of cancer care and the workforce, and (5) recommendations for physician well-being interventions. Underlying oncologist burnout exacerbated stressors associated with disruptions in care, education, research, financial practice health, and telemedicine. Many feared delays in cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Oncologists noted personal and familial stressors related to COVID-19 exposure fears and loss of social support. Many participants strongly considered working part-time or taking early retirement. Yet, opportunities arose to facilitate personal growth and rise above pandemic adversity, fostering greater resilience. Recommendations for organizational well-being interventions included psychologic or peer support resources, flexible time-off, and ASCO and state oncology societies involvement to develop care guidelines, well-being resources, and mental health advocacy. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected oncologist burnout, fulfillment, practice health, cancer care, and workforce.

The state of Texas ranks 2nd in infection with over 2.71 million cases and has seen a disproportionate rate of death across the state. The TX CARES project was funded by the state of Texas to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody status in children and adults. Materials and MethodsThe TX CARES (Texas Coronavirus Antibody Response Survey) is an ongoing prospective population-based convenience sample from the Texas general population that commenced in October 2020. Volunteer participants are recruited across the state to participate in a 3-time point data collection TX CARES to assess antibody response over time. We use the Roche Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassay to determine SARS-CoV-2 antibody status. ResultsThe crude antibody positivity prevalence in Phase I was 26.1% (80/307). The fully adjusted seroprevalence of the sample was 31.5%. Specifically, 41.1% of males and 21.9% of females were seropositive. For age categories, 33.5% of those 18-34; 24.4% of those 35-44; 33.2% of those 45-54; and 32.8% of those 55+ were seropositive. In this sample,42.2% (89/211) of those negative for the antibody test reported having had a COVID-19 test. ConclusionsIn this survey we enrolled and analyzed data for 319 participants, demonstrating a high survey and antibody test completion rate, and ability to implement a questionnaire and SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing within FQHC clinical settings. We were also able to determine our capability to estimate the cross-sectional seroprevalence within Texass FQHC clinical settings.

The genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 contains structural elements important for viral replication and/or pathogenesis making them potential therapeutic targets. Here we report on the stem-loop II motif, a highly conserved noncoding RNA element. Based on our homology model we determined that the G to U transversion in the SARS-CoV-2 stem-loop II motif (S2MG35U) forms a C-U base-pair isosteric to the C-G base-pair in the early 2000's SARS-CoV (S2M). In addition, chemo-enzymatic probing and molecular dynamics simulations indicate the S2MG35U conformational profile is altered compared to S2M in the apical loop region. We explored S2MG35U as a potential drug target by docking a library of FDA approved drugs. Enzymatic probing of the best docking ligands (aminoglycosides and polymyxins) indicated that polymyxin binding alters the conformational profile and/or secondary structure of the RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 stem-loop II motif conformational differences due to nucleotide transversion and ligand binding are highly significant and provide insight for future drug discovery efforts since the conformation of noncoding RNA elements affects their function.","Aldhumani, Ali H; Hossain, Md Ismail; Fairchild, Emily A; Boesger, Hannah; Marino, Emily C; Myers, Mason; Hines, Jennifer V",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,601,26

This year in view of COVID-19 pandemic, attitudes of HCWs towards vaccination are particularly important. A cross-sectional study was completed to understand how to best encourage and facilitate the vaccination of HCWs based on the previous years' findings. METHODS: An online survey was disseminated to all hospital staff via electronic channels. The clinical audit sphinx software was used for data collection and analysis. RESULTS: The total number of responses was n = 728, almost double the rate from 2018 (N = 393). A total of 78% (N = 551) of participants were vaccinated last year. A total of 94% (N = 677) of participants reported their intention to be vaccinated this year. The main barriers listed were being unable to find time (32%, N = 36), side effects (30%, N = 33) and thinking that it does not work (21%, N = 23). The most popular suggestions for how to increase uptake were more mobile immunisation clinics (72%, N = 517) and more information on the vaccine (50%, N = 360). A total of 82% of participants (N = 590) agreed that healthcare workers should be vaccinated, with 56% (N = 405) agreeing that it should be mandatory. Of the participants who were not vaccinated last year (N = 159), 40% (N = 63) agreed that COVID-19 had changed their opinion on influenza immunisation with a further 11% (N = 18) strongly agreeing. DISCUSSION: In light of the increasing number of survey participants, more staff were interested in flu vaccination this year than ever before. The COVID-19 pandemic has had some influence on staff's likelihood to be vaccinated. Feasibility of immunisation and education posed the largest barriers to HCW vaccination.","Kearns, Emma C; Callanan, Ian; O039,; Reilly, Ann; Purcell, Aisling; Tuohy, Niamh; Bulfin, Siobhan; Smyth, Angela; Bairead, Emer; Fitzgerald, Susan; Feeney, Eoin; Waqas, Sarmad",Ir. j. med. sci,601,11

Some cardiac defects may be associated with a poor COVID-19 outcome. Risk estimation in ACHD is currently based on expert opinion. The aim of this study was to collect clinical outcome data and to identify risk factors for a complicated course of COVID-19 in patients with ACHD. METHODS: Twenty-five ACHD centres in nine European countries participated in the study. Consecutive patients with ACHD diagnosed with COVID-19 presenting to one of the participating centres between 27 March and 6 June 2020 were included. A complicated disease course was defined as hospitalisation for COVID-19 requiring non-invasive or invasive ventilation and/or inotropic support, or a fatal outcome. RESULTS: Of 105 patients with a mean age of 38±13 years (58% women), 13 had a complicated disease course, of whom 5 died. In univariable analysis, age (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7, per 5 years), &#8805;2 comorbidities (OR 7.1, 95% CI 2.1 to 24.5), body mass index of >25 kg/m2 (OR 7.2, 95% CI 1.9 to 28.3) and cyanotic heart disease (OR 13.2, 95% CI 2.5 to 68.4) were associated with a complicated disease course. In a multivariable logistic regression model, cyanotic heart disease was the most important predictor (OR 60.0, 95% CI 7.6 to 474.0). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with ACHD, general risk factors (age, obesity and multiple comorbidities) are associated with an increased risk of complicated COVID-19 course. Congenital cardiac defects at particularly high risk were cyanotic lesions, including unrepaired cyanotic defects or Eisenmenger syndrome.","Schwerzmann, Markus; Ruperti-Repilado, Francisco Javier; Baumgartner, Helmut; Bouma, Berto; Bouchardy, Judith; Budts, Werner; Campens, Laurence; Chessa, Massimo; Del Cerro Marin, Maria Jesús; Gabriel, Harald; Gallego, Pastora; Garcia-Orta, Rocio; Gonzalez, Ana Elvira; Jensen, Annette Schophuus; Ladouceur, Magalie; Miranda-Barrio, Berta; Morissens, Marielle; Pasquet, Agnes; Rueda, Joaquín; van den Bosch, Annemien E; van der Zwaan, Heleen Berdina; Tobler, Daniel; Greutmann, Matthias",Heart,601,13

Strategies for cholera control include improving water, sanitation, and hygiene; providing early and effective treatment; and deploying oral cholera vaccine (OCV). This last strategy is relatively new, and countries considering its introduction are interested in knowing the potential cost not only of the vaccine, but also the cost of introduction. This paper describes the costing of OCV introduction in LMICs using a publicly available Excel-based tool known as the CholTool. It includes estimates of delivery cost categories which cover not only the service delivery costs (e.g. vaccine procurement, handling, storage, and transport; vaccination administration, monitoring supervision, and field support), but also the programmatic costs associated with introducing a new vaccine (i.e. microplanning, communication and training materials development, sensitization/social mobilization, and personnel training) to ensure that a comprehensive estimate is provided with health payer perspective. CholTool takes the user through a structured sequence of interlinked modules containing input parameter cells (assumptions), decision cells (variable selections), and formulas (calculations) to produce customized cost estimates based on standardized methods. The tool provides both financial and economic cost estimates, to ensure that both costs are available for consideration. Four examples of applications of CholTool are presented in three countries- one in Ethiopia, two in Malawi and one in Nepal. The estimates of economic delivery cost per dose (including service delivery and programmatic costs) were (in USD 2016): $2.89 in Ethiopia, $3.04 in Malawi1, $3.35 in Malawi2 and $3.06 in Nepal. A cost projection conducted before the campaign using the tool and a retrospective costing using the tool in Nepal resulted in no significant difference between economic delivery costs per dose.","Morgan, Winthrop; Levin, Ann; Hutubessy, Raymond Cw; Mogasale, Vittal",Hum Vaccin Immunother,601,20

Acute kidney injury requiring dialysis is common in critically ill patients and circuit clotting compromises efficacy of treatment. This study aims to analyze the circuit life and circuit clotting during continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) and intermittent hemodialysis in patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study in critically ill patients undergoing CKRT or intermittent hemodialysis between 1 February 2020 to 22 May 2020. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 infection and contemporary controls who tested negative were included. Co-primary outcomes were functional circuit life for patients on CKRT and all circuit clotting events for patients on CKRT and/or intermittent hemodialysis. RESULTS: Seventy CKRT circuits and 32 intermittent hemodialysis sessions for 12 COVID-19 cases and 22 CKRT circuits and 18 intermittent hemodialysis sessions for 15 controls were analyzed. CKRT circuit clotting was more common in the COVID-19 group compared to the control group (64% vs 36%, p = 0.02), despite higher anticoagulation use in the COVID-19 group (41% vs 14%, p = 0.02). Functional CKRT circuit life was similar in COVID-19 patients and controls (median 11 vs 12 h, p = 0.69). On Cox regression analysis, circuit clotting was similar with hazard ratio (HR) 1.90 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89-4.04]; however, clotting was increased in COVID-19 patients after adjustment for anticoagulation use (HR: 3.31 [95% CI 1.49-7.33]). In patients with COVID-19, CKRT circuits with anticoagulation had a longer circuit life compared to CKRT circuits without anticoagulation (median 22 versus 7 h respectively, p < 0.001). Circuit clotting was similar in both groups undergoing intermittent hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: Dialysis clotting amongst COVID-19 patients is increased despite more anticoagulation use and the hazard for clotting is greater especially after adjusting for anticoagulation use. Circuit life was suboptimal in COVID-19 patients on circuits without anticoagulation and therefore routine use of anticoagulation amongst COVID-19 patients should be considered whenever possible.","Khoo, Benjamin Zhi En; Lim, Regina Shaoying; See, Yong Pey; Yeo, See Cheng",BMC Nephrol,601,0

METHODS: A longitudinal study of 560 participants including 147 healthy controls was conducted between April 30 and May 30, 2020 during a state-wide lockdown. Bi-weekly measures included the Coronavirus Impact Scale, the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, the Patient Health Questionnaire, 9-item, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, 7-item. Generalized estimating equations method was used to examine the longitudinal change of the measures within the lockdown and the change from pre-pandemic period to pandemic period. RESULTS: All participants reported an impact of lockdown. Individuals with bipolar disorder reported greater impact from the stay-at-home orders with disruptions in routines, income/employment, social support and pandemic related stress. While these measures improved over time, healthy controls recovered quicker and with greater magnitude than persons with bipolar disorder. Comparing mood symptom severity measures in mid-March through May 2020 to the same time window in 2015-2019 (pre- verses post-pandemic), there were no significant differences among individuals with bipolar disorder, whereas healthy controls showed a significant, albeit transient, increase in mood symptoms. CONCLUSION: Everyone was impacted by the SARs-CoV pandemic; however, those with bipolar disorder experienced more life impacting changes from the stay-at-home orders vs healthy controls. These disruptions improved over time but much more slowly than healthy controls. Pre- vs post-pandemic comparisons show a modest but significant increase in mood severity in the healthy controls which was not observed in those with bipolar disorder.","Yocum, Anastasia K; Zhai, Yuqi; McInnis, Melvin G; Han, Peisong",J Affect Disord,601,16

DESIGN: A mixed-methods cross-sectional survey study design. Responses to the structured questionnaire were analysed using descriptive and non-parametric statistics. STUDY SAMPLE: UK based hearing care professionals (HCP) (n = 323) completed the survey (218 public sector; 89 private sector). RESULTS: Changes in working patterns varied greatly between different sectors, with 61% of national employed and 26% of independent HCPs being furloughed, compared with 1% in the public sector. Use of telehealth was under-utilised across all sectors and groups in UK hearing healthcare, despite 92% of public and 75% of private HCPs reporting feeling comfortable conducting remote consultations. CONCLUSION: This study highlights a variation in teleaudiology adoption and key barriers across sector in the UK. A collaborative approach between hearing device manufacturers, research centres, HCPs and professional bodies is required for the creation of targeted guidance and training materials according to sector, to support clinicians in effective teleaudiology provision.","Parmar, Bhavisha; Beukes, Eldre; Rajasingam, Saima",Int J Audiol,601,14

The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the mental health of health care professionals and the general population. Most of the research has focused on the immediate and short-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a paucity of research available exploring the longterm mental health effects. Experience with previous disasters has shown that survivors suffer from various mental health problems including posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, phobias, fears with avoidant behaviors, and various neuropsychiatric disorders. There has been an increased incidence of substance use and internet addiction along with increased rates of domestic violence and child abuse. Social distancing is helpful in limiting the spread of the disease, but the impact of social distancing and quarantine has resulted in increased anxiety among the general population. The long-term mental health effects are anticipated to be intensified due to the pandemic affecting people worldwide. Mitigation strategies need to be implemented as there will be no vaccine available to limit the long-term mental health effects of this pandemic.

It is a safe therapy, with few potential risks even if administered at high concentration. Inhaled NO gas is routinely used to increase systemic oxygenation in different disease conditions. The administration of high concentrations of NO also exerts a virucidal effect in vitro. Owing to its favorable pharmacodynamic and safety profiles, the familiarity in its use by critical care providers, and the potential for a direct virucidal effect, NO is clinically used in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, no device is currently available to easily administer inhaled NO at concentrations higher than 80 parts per million (ppm) at various inspired oxygen fractions, without the need for dedicated, heavy, and costly equipment. The development of a reliable, safe, inexpensive, lightweight, and ventilator-free solution is crucial, particularly for the early treatment of non-intubated patients outside of the intensive care unit (ICU) and in a limited-resource scenario. To overcome such a barrier, a simple system for the non-invasive NO gas administration up to 250 ppm was developed using standard consumables and a scavenging chamber. The method has been proven safe and reliable in delivering a specified NO concentration while limiting nitrogen dioxide levels. This paper aims to provide clinicians and researchers with the necessary information on how to assemble or adapt such a system for research purposes or clinical use in COVID-19 or other diseases in which NO administration might be beneficial.","Pinciroli, Riccardo; Traeger, Lisa; Fischbach, Anna; Gianni, Stefano; Morais, Caio Cesar Araujo; Fakhr, Bijan Safaee; Di Fenza, Raffaele; Robinson, Dianna; Carroll, Ryan; Zapol, Warren M; Berra, Lorenzo",J. vis. exp,601,20

The sustained economic devastation, which began at least 8 weeks prior to the first social distancing and shelter in place orders issued in the U.S. and Canada, has been further complicated by a history of aggressive policing of migrant massage workers in the wake of the war against human trafficking. Migrant Asian massage businesses are increasingly policed as locales of potential illicit sex work and human trafficking, as police and anti-trafficking initiatives target migrant Asian massage workers despite the fact that most do not provide sexual services. The scapegoating of migrant Asian massage workers and criminalization of sex work have led to devastating systemic and interpersonal violence, including numerous deportations, arrests, and deaths, most notably the recent murder of eight people at three Atlanta-based spas. The policing of sex workers has historically been mobilized along fears of sexually transmitted disease and infection, and more recently, within the past two decades, around a moral panic against sex trafficking. New racial anxieties around the coronavirus as an Asian disease have been mobilized by the state to further cement the justification of policing Asian migrant workers along the axes of health, migration, and sexual labor. These justifications also solidify discriminatory social welfare regimes that exclude Asian migrant massage workers from accessing services on the basis of the informality and illegality of their work mixed with their precarious citizenship status. This paper draws from ethnographic participant observation and survey data collected by two sex worker organizations that work primarily with massage workers in Toronto and New York City to examine the double-edged sword of policing during the pandemic in the name of anti-trafficking coupled with exclusionary policies regarding emergency relief and social welfare, and its effects on migrant Asian massage workers in North America. Although not all migrant Asian massage workers, including those surveyed in this paper, provide sexual services, they are conflated, targeted, and treated as such by the state and therefore face similar barriers of criminalization, discrimination, and exclusion. This paper recognizes that most migrant Asian massage workers do not identify as sex workers and does not intend to label them as such or reproduce the scapegoating rhetoric used by law enforcement. Rather, it seeks to analyze how exclusionary attitudes and policies towards sex workers are transferred onto migrant Asian massage workers as well whether or not they provide sexual services.","Lam, Elene Shih Elena Chin Katherine Zen Kate",Social Sciences,601,1

However, most of the studies in the literature focused on digital competencies in general without paying specific attention to learning. Therefore, this paper developed a DLC framework based on a comprehensive literature review, which consists of six dimensions, namely technology use, cognitive processing, digital reading skill, time-management, peer management and will management. This study then developed a scale to assess these competencies where 3473 middle school students participated in the scale validation process. Specifically, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and item discrimination were used to validate this scale. The six dimensions accounted for 58.66% of the total variance of the scale. The overall internal consistency coefficient was 0.94 for the scale. The results showed that the developed DLC scale is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing middle school students’ digital learning competence. The findings of this study can help teachers and specialists to improve the competencies of their learners by providing a new validated scale that could be used to assess learners and identify their DLC weakness, hence provide the needed trainings accordingly.","Yang, Junfeng Tlili Ahmed Huang Ronghuai Zhuang Rongxia Bhagat Kaushal Kumar",Sustainability,601,16

This retrospective cohort study examined how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted burn volumes and time to presentation. All burn admissions were included from January 20 th - August 31 st for the years 2020, 2019, & 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic group included admissions from 1/20/2020-8/31/2020 and was compared to the non-pandemic group comprised of admissions from 1/20-8/31 in 2018 and 2019. Subgroup analysis was performed according to meaningful dates during the COVID-19 pandemic including the 1 st US COVID-19 case, shelter in place, and state reopening orders. Admission volumes were 403 patients in the COVID-19 pandemic group compared to a mean of 429 patients in the non-pandemic group, which correlated to a 5.8% decrease in volume during the pandemic. The pandemic group showed an increase in time to presentation of 1 day (p<0.0001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated stable admission volumes and an increase in time to presentation of 1 day (P<0.0001) at each timepoint.

Some orthopaedic surgeons in Wuhan were infected with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a survey to identify the orthopaedic surgeons who were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to collect information such as social demographic variables, clinical manifestations, exposure history, awareness of the outbreak, infection control training provided by hospitals, and individual protection practices. To further explore the possible risk factors at the individual level, a 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 26 orthopaedic surgeons from 8 hospitals in Wuhan were identified as having COVID-19. The incidence in each hospital varied from 1.5% to 20.7%. The onset of symptoms was from January 13 to February 5, 2020, and peaked on January 23, 8 days prior to the peak of the public epidemic. The suspected sites of exposure were general wards (79.2%), public places at the hospital (20.8%), operating rooms (12.5%), the intensive care unit (4.2%), and the outpatient clinic (4.2%). There was transmission from these doctors to others in 25% of cases, including to family members (20.8%), to colleagues (4.2%), to patients (4.2%), and to friends (4.2%). Participation in real-time training on prevention measures was found to have a protective effect against COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 0.12). Not wearing an N95 respirator was found to be a risk factor (OR, 5.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09 to 25.00]). Wearing respirators or masks all of the time was found to be protective (OR, 0.15). Severe fatigue was found to be a risk factor (OR, 4 [95% CI, 1 to 16]) for infection with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Orthopaedic surgeons are at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Common places of work could be contaminated.

Systemic ozone therapy (OT) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2. The rationale and mechanism of action has already been proven clinically in other viral infections and has been shown in research studies to be highly effective at decreasing organ damage mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress. This review summarizes the OT studies that illustrate the possible cytoprotective mechanism of action of ozone and its physiological by-products in target organs affected by SARS-CoV-2. (2) Methods: This review encompasses a total of 74 peer-reviewed original articles. It is mainly focused on ozone as a modulator of the NF-&#954; B/Nrf2 pathways and IL-6/IL-1ß expression. (3) Results: In experimental models and the few existent clinical studies, homeostasis of the free radical and antioxidant balance by OT was associated with a modulation of NF-&#954; B/Nrf2 balance and IL-6 and IL-1ß expression. These molecular mechanisms support the cytoprotective effects of OT against tissue damage present in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. (4) Conclusions: The potential cytoprotective role of OT in the management of organ damage induced by COVID-19 merits further research.

In this paper, we develop an inferential method based on ideas from conformal prediction, which can wrap around any survival prediction algorithm to produce calibrated, covariate-dependent lower predictive bounds on survival times. In the Type I right-censoring setting, when the censoring times are completely exogenous, the lower predictive bounds have guaranteed coverage in finite samples without any assumptions other than that of operating on independent and identically distributed data points. Under a more general conditionally independent censoring assumption, the bounds satisfy a doubly robust property which states the following: marginal coverage is approximately guaranteed if either the censoring mechanism or the conditional survival function is estimated well. Further, we demonstrate that the lower predictive bounds remain valid and informative for other types of censoring.

The need to adapt to ""new normal"" and contain the rapid spread of disease, while maintaining a functional society, resulted with introduction of numerous new legal mechanisms and adaptation of the existing ones. However, it seems that one area of law remains on the fringes: the regulation of wills. Even before the start of the pandemic many authors often pointed to the fact that the current legal framework does not follow modern technological developments, but no significant attempts were made to overhaul the inheritance law. Also, once the pandemic started in its full, there were no references to introduction of extraordinary mechanisms or new legal solutions to overcome the potential difficulties in forming wills. Comparative analysis yielded no better results: although some countries (such as Austria) recently completely overhauled their regulation of inheritance law, it seems that no attempts were made to introduce new types of wills or new methods of drafting wills into their regulations. Furthermore, following the spread of the pandemic, increasing number of potential testators find themselves unable to use traditional methods of drafting wills as they, or the authorized persons tasked with assistance and creation of wills, remain isolated from one another due to various reasons (lock-downs, isolation in case of experiencing symptoms, etc.). Having in mind these circumstances, it is necessary to ascertain whether there is a genuine need to introduce new types of wills into existing legal framework, or to adapt the current legal framework by facilitating the communication between citizens and the institutions. Also, it is necessary to analyze whether the interpretation of the existing legal framework enables the introduction of certain facilitating mechanisms.

Olfactory training involving aromatic oils has been recommended to improve olfactory recovery, but quantitative data are missing. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify the benefit of olfactory training and visual stimulation assisted by a dedicated web application for patients who experienced olfactory dysfunction for &#8805;1 month. METHODS: We performed an observational, real-life, data-based study on a cohort of patients who experienced at least 1 month of persistent olfactory dysfunction between January 30 and March 26, 2021. An analysis was performed after a mean olfactory training time of 4 weeks, and at least 500 patients were assessable for primary outcome assessment. Participants exposed themselves twice daily to odors from 4 high-concentration oils and visual stimulation assisted by a dedicated web application. Improvement was defined as a 2-point increase on a 10-point, self-assessed olfactory visual analogue scale. RESULTS: In total, 548 patients were assessable for primary outcome assessment. The mean baseline, self-assessed olfactory score was 1.9 (SD 1.7), and this increased to 4.6 (SD 2.8) after a mean olfactory training time of 27.7 days (SD 17.2). Olfactory training was associated with at least a 2-point increase in 64.2% (352/548) of patients. The rate of patients' olfactory improvement was higher for patients who trained for more than 28 days than that rate for patients who trained for less than 28 days (73.3% vs 59%; P=.002). The time to olfactory improvement was 8 days faster for patients with hyposmia compared to the time to improvement for patients with anosmia (P<.001). This benefit was observed regardless of the duration of the olfactory dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory training and visual stimulation assisted by a dedicated web application was associated with significant improvement in olfaction, especially after 28 days of olfactory training.","Denis, Fabrice; Septans, Anne-Lise; Periers, Lea; Maillard, Jean-Michel; Legoff, Florian; Gurden, Hirac; Moriniere, Sylvain",J Med Internet Res,601,0

However, as more data from controlled trials became available, the results became disappointing, with at best moderate evidence of efficacy when CCP with high titers of neutralizing antibodies was used early in infection. To better understand the potential therapeutic efficacy of CCP, and to further validate SARS-CoV-2 infection of macaques as a reliable animal model for testing such strategies, we inoculated 12 adult rhesus macaques with SARS-CoV-2 by intratracheal and intranasal routes. One day later, 8 animals were infused with pooled human CCP with a high titer of neutralizing antibodies (RVPN NT50 value of 3,003), while 4 control animals received normal human plasma. Animals were monitored for 7 days. Animals treated with CCP had detectable levels of antiviral antibodies after infusion. In comparison to the control animals, they had similar levels of virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract, but had significantly reduced interstitial pneumonia, as measured by comprehensive lung histology. By highlighting strengths and weaknesses, data of this study can help to further optimize nonhuman primate models to provide proof-of-concept of intervention strategies, and guide the future use of convalescent plasma against SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other newly emerging respiratory viruses. Author summaryThe results of treating SARS-CoV-2 infected hospitalized patients with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP), collected from survivors of natural infection, have been disappointing. The available data from various studies indicate at best moderate clinical benefits only when CCP with high titer of neutralizing antibodies was infused early in infection. The macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be useful to gain further insights in the value of CCP therapy. In this study, animals were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the next day, were infused with pooled human convalescent plasma, selected to have a very high titer of neutralizing antibodies. While administration of CCP did not result in a detectable reduction in virus replication in the respiratory tract, it significantly reduced lung inflammation. These data, combined with the results of monoclonal antibody studies, emphasize the need to use products with high titers of neutralizing antibodies, and guide the future development of CCP-based therapies.","Rompay, Koen K.A.

We focus onCOVID-19and its information during the period when the disease was widely spread in China, i.e., from January 25th to March 24th, 2020. We first explore how the disease and information co-evolve via the spatial analysis of the two spreading processes. We visualize the geo-location of both disease and information at the province level and find that disease is more geo-localized compared to information. We find a high correlation between the disease and information data, and also people care about the spread only when it comes to their neighborhood. Regard to the content of the information, we find that positive messages are more negatively correlated with the disease compared to negative and neutral messages. Additionally, we introduce machine learning algorithms, i.e., linear regression and random forest, to further predict the number of infected using different disease spatial related and information-related characteristics. We obtain that the disease spatial related characteristics of nearby cities can help to improve the prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, information-related characteristics can also help to improve the prediction performance, but with a delay, i.e., the improvement comes from using, for instance, the number of messages 10 days ago, for disease prediction.

Clinical trials are a key element of comprehensive cancer care. Ensuring the continuing safe conduct of cancer clinical trials in the context of a pandemic is challenging. METHODS: We aimed to describe the COVID-19 pandemic response of a Cancer Care Clinical Research Unit (CRU) of a tertiary hospital in Queensland, Australia. We used a mixed methods approach for this case study. Emailed directives from CRU managers to all CRU staff sharing were qualitatively analysed and mapped against our unit activities over longitudinal time points. Data from patient recruitment and protocol deviations were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Mapping activity from 11 March to 30 September 2020 revealed rapid change during the first 2 weeks. Four key strategies to accommodate change were identified: supporting patients and families, introduction of telehealth, accessing investigational product, and social distancing. Early in the pandemic we recognised that our core key stakeholders were integral to our response. When compared to the previous 12 months, our recruitment numbers dropped markedly in early phases of the response but recovered over time, as we accommodated internal and external impacts. CONCLUSION: Our experience of agility as a necessity, adapting to support patients, and managing both clinical research activity and sponsors during the height of the pandemic response is presented here in order to inform future disaster response planning by clinical trial organisations.","Ives, Amy; Pusztai, Tricia; Keller, Jacqui; Ahern, Elizabeth; Chan, Bryan; Gasper, Harry; Wyld, David; Kennedy, Glen; Dickie, Graeme; Lwin, Zarnie; Roberts, Natasha A",Asia Pac. j. clin.oncol,601,20

With lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that were approved by the FDA as vectors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines, we designed a series of vaccines efficiently encapsulated with varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E (VZV-gE) and nucleic acids including polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) and the natural phosphodiester CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN), which was approved by the FDA as an immunostimulator in a hepatitis B vaccine. Preclinical trial in mice showed that these LNP vaccines could induce VZV-gE IgG titers more than 16 times those induced by an alum adjuvant, and immunized serum could block in vitro infection completely at a dilution of 1:80, which indicated potential as a varicella vaccine. The magnitude of the cell-mediated immunity induced was generally more than 10 times that induced by the alum adjuvant, indicating potential as a zoster vaccine. These results showed that immunostimulatory nucleic acids together with LNPs have promise as safe and economical varicella and zoster vaccine candidates.","Cao, Han; Wang, Yunfei; Luan, Ning; Liu, Cunbao",,601,32

Lower numbers of reads with >90% amino acid identity to previously described calicivirus, circovirus, adenoviruses, hepatovirus, bocaparvoviruses, and polyomavirus in other bat species were also found, likely reflecting their wide distribution among different bats. Unexpectedly, a few sequence reads of canine parvovirus 2 and the recently described mouse kidney parvovirus were also detected and their presence confirmed by PCR; these possibly originated from guano contamination by carnivores and rodents.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in complete blood count parameters and differential counts in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who survived compared to those who died. DESIGN: We performed a single-center retrospective study including 242 patients with confirmed COVID-19. We described the characteristics of the complete blood count parameters in these patients. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare hematologic parameters of patients who died and those who survived; multivariate logistic regression was used to look for associations with mortality. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 who died had significantly lower median absolute monocyte count (AMC) (0.4 vs 0.5, P = .039) and median platelet count (169 vs 213, P = .009) compared to those who survived. Patients who died had a significantly higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (6.4 vs 4.5, P = .001). The NLR was positively associated with death (OR = 1.038; 95% CI, 1.003-1.074, P = .031), while AMC was inversely associated with death (OR = 0.200; 95% CI, 0.052-0.761, P = .018).

We explored the feasibility and accuracy of delayed phase (DP) chest computed tomography (CT) performed immediately after brain CT perfusion (CTP) for the identification of thrombotic complications and myocardial fibrosis among patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods: Since July, we have incorporated the use of low dose chest CT scans using a spectral CT scanner in all patients admitted with AIS, encouraging acquisitions, five min after brain CTP. All scans were non gated and comprised low dose chest CT scans, without additional contrast. Using virtual monochromatic imaging and iodine maps, we evaluated the presence of thrombotic complications, myocardial late enhancement, and myocardial extracellular volume (ECV), as a surrogate of edema and interstitial fibrosis. Results: We included 22 patients. The mean age was 66.2±19.6 years. In 5 patients, a cardioembolic (CE) source was later identified by transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), [left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus, n=1], transthoracic echocardiogram with agitated saline injection (patent foramen ovale n=2), or by EKG (atrial fibrillation). Seven patients further underwent either TEE or cardiac CT to identify CE sources. DP non gated chest CT had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% to identify CE sources, 1 LAA thrombus correctly detected. Chest CT identified pulmonary thromboembolism (PE), later confirmed with CT angiography. Chest CT identified myocardial late enhancement in 16 patients (80% in CE vs. 71% in non CE, p=0.68), myocardial fat in 1, and coronary calcification in 77% [with 2.6±2.2 vs 3.8±3.6 coronary calcified segments in CE vs. non CEstrokes, p=0.36). The mean ECV was 35±4% in CE vs 32±6% in non CE strokes (p=0.17). The 2patients with a positive PCR test for COVID-19 showed evidence of myocardial late iodineenhancement, and incremented ECV of the septal wall (38% and 40%, respectively). Conclusions: In this pilot study, DP, non ECG gated, low dose chest CT scan performed 5 min afterbrain CTP with a spectral scanner;enabled straightforward identification of CE sources amongpatients with AIS. This approach allowed detection of PE and myocardial injury.","Granillo, G. R.; Cirio, J. J.; Lylyk, I.; Perez, N.; Caballero, M. L.; Ciardi, C.; Ceron, M.; Castrillon, R.

The aim of our study was to determine SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention and control knowledge and attitudes of frontline health workers in four provinces of South Africa as well as explore some elements of health worker and health facility infection prevention and control practices. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was utilised. The study population comprised both clinical and non-clinical staff working in casualty departments, outpatient departments, and entrance points of health facilities. A structured self-administered questionnaire was developed using the World Health Organization guidance as the basis for the knowledge questions. COVID-19 protocols were observed during data collection. RESULTS: A total of 286 health workers from 47 health facilities at different levels of care participated in the survey. The mean score on the 10 knowledge items was 6.3 (SD = 1.6). Approximately two-thirds of participants (67.4%) answered six or more questions correctly while less than a quarter of all participants (24.1%) managed to score eight or more. A knowledge score of 8 or more was significantly associated with occupational category (being either a medical doctor or nurse), age (< 40 years) and level of hospital (tertiary level). Only half of participants (50.7%) felt adequately prepared to deal with patients with COVD-19 at the time of the survey. The health workers displaying attitudes that would put themselves or others at risk were in the minority. Only 55.6% of participants had received infection prevention and control training. Some participants indicated they did not have access to medical masks (11.8%) and gloves (9.9%) in their departments. CONCLUSIONS: The attitudes of participants reflected a willingness to engage in appropriate SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention and control practices as well as a commitment to be involved in COVID-19 patient care. Ensuring adequate infection prevention and control training for all staff and universal access to appropriate PPE were identified as key areas that needed to be addressed.

Using supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in Japan, this study examines how governments can mitigate these economic losses when they are obliged to implement lockdowns. Through tests of all combinations of two-region lockdowns, we find that coordinated, i.e., simultaneous, lockdowns yield smaller GDP losses than uncoordinated lockdowns. Furthermore, we test practical scenarios in which Japan's 47 regions impose lockdowns over three months and find that GDP losses are lower if nationwide lockdowns are coordinated than if they are uncoordinated.","Inoue, Hiroyasu; Murase, Yohsuke; Todo, Yasuyuki",,601,23

During previsit planning, risk factors of the patient and procedures are considered. High-risk AGPs are identified by duration, proximity, manipulation of high-viral load tissue, and use of powered instrumentation. Appropriate personal protective equipment includes selection of respiratory and eye protection. COVID-19 testing can screen for asymptomatic carriers prior to high-risk procedures; however, alternative testing methods are required in rhinologic patients not eligible for nasopharyngeal testing due to nasal obstruction or skull base defects.

Several therapeutic options are currently emerging but none with universal consensus or proven efficacy. Solid organ transplant recipients are perceived to be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 because of their immunosuppressed conditions due to chronic use of immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs). It is therefore likely that solid organ transplant recipients will be treated with these experimental antivirals. METHODS: This article is not intended to provide a systematic literature review on investigational treatments tested against COVID-19; rather, the authors aim to provide recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring of ISDs in transplant recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2 based on a review of existing data in the literature. RESULTS: Management of drug-drug interactions between investigational anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and immunosuppressants is a complex task for the clinician. Adequate immunosuppression is necessary to prevent graft rejection while, if critically ill, the patient may benefit from pharmacotherapeutic interventions directed at limiting SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. Maintaining ISD concentrations within the desired therapeutic range requires a highly individualized approach that is complicated by the pandemic context and lack of hindsight. CONCLUSIONS: With this article, the authors inform the clinician about the potential interactions of experimental COVID-19 treatments with ISDs used in transplantation. Recommendations regarding therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustments in the context of COVID-19 are provided.","Elens, Laure; Langman, Loralie J; Hesselink, Dennis A; Bergan, Stein; Moes, Dirk Jan A R; Molinaro, Mariadelfina; Venkataramanan, Raman; Lemaitre, Florian",Ther Drug Monit,601,16

Design : A cross section design using a non-random sample of 206 women completed the questionnaire during the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown from April to June 2020 in Spain. Psychological, sociodemographic and obstetric factors and the new PREPS were collected. Results : Bartlett's test of sphericity (χ2(105) = 580.36, p < .001), and KMO = .79 confirmed appropriateness for factor analysis of the PREPS. Confirmatory factor analyses based on the factor structure of the original USA English version of this instrument confirmed three factors - Preparedness Stress (7 items), Perinatal Infection Stress (5 items), and Positive Appraisal (3 items). The 15-item version of the PREPS demonstrates internal consistency and reliability are adequate (α > .77), and for F1 - Preparedness (α > .65), for F2 - Infection (α > 0.60) and for F3 - Positive appraisal (α > .55). The three factors exhibited good inter-item correlations, (F1 – Preparedness: .21;F2 – Infection: .23, and F3 – Positive Appraisal: .29).

However, while there is evidence documenting the growth in discrimination and xenophobia, little is known about how the COVID-19 outbreak is activating the expression of such negative attitudes. The goal of the current paper therefore was to investigate what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to this rise in expressions of prejudice and xenophobia. More specifically, this study used an experimental design to assess the effects of using stigmatized language to describe the virus as well as the threat to physical health and economic wellbeing posed by the virus on COVID-19 prejudice. Data were collected from a national sample of 1451 adults residing within the United States. Results from 2 × 2 x 2 between-subjects analyses of covariance demonstrated that emphasizing the connection between China and COVID-19, rather than framing the virus neutrally, increased negative attitudes toward Asian Americans, beliefs that resources should be prioritized for Americans rather than immigrants, and general xenophobia. Emphasizing the severity of the economic impact of the virus also increased beliefs that Asian Americans are a threat to resources and general xenophobia. In contrast, messages which emphasized the serious health risks of COVID-19 did not increase bias toward Asian Americans or xenophobia. Our findings suggest that specific types of public health messaging related to infectious diseases, especially framing the virus in terms of its country of origin or its likely economic impact, may elicit prejudice and xenophobia. Public health campaigns that emphasize the severity of the virus, however, are not likely to trigger the same negative attitudes.

We aimed to describe the prevalence and features of anosmia in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We retrospectively included COVID-19 patients with anosmia between March 1st and March 17th, 2020. We used SARS-CoV-2 real time PCR in respiratory samples to confirm the cases. RESULTS: Fifty-four of 114 patients (47%) with confirmed COVID-19 reported anosmia. Mean age of the 54 patients was 47 (±16) years; 67% were females and 37% were hospitalised. The median Charlson comorbidity index was 0.70 (±1.6 [0-7]). Forty-six patients (85%) had dysgeusia and 28% presented with pneumonia. Anosmia began 4.4 (±1.9 [1-8]) days after infection onset. The mean duration of anosmia was 8.9 (±6.3 [1-21]) days and 98% of patients recovered within 28 days.

Local production of ABHRs in health facilities is recommended by WHO due to its availability and affordability reasons. However, fire hazard is a concern in health facilities during ABHRs production, storage, or use from dispensers. Objective: To evaluate the preparedness of public hospitals found in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia towards potential fire hazards during ABHR production and storage practices. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was applied. An assessment checklist was used for evaluating public hospitals' measures taken for the potential fire hazards during ABHR production and storage practice. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 was used for data entry and analysis. Results: Out of the 13 public hospitals observed in the study, fire extinguishers were not available in more than half of the hospitals' (7 hospitals) compounding premises. Also, 57.1% of the hospitals without fire extinguishers were manufacturing beyond the WHO 50 liters limit of ABHR solution at once under such unfavorable conditions. Moreover, ethanol and the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide were not stored separately in eight hospitals. Conclusion: None of the hospitals were found to be well prepared for the potential risk of fire associated with ABHR solution production and storage practice. Generally, the practices taken by the studied hospitals for preventing the fire risk and minimizing the damage if fire hazards occurred during ABHR production and storage were not satisfactory. On the safety and precautions measures taken for the risk of fire, Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH), Amanuel Mental Specialized Hospital (AMSH), and Eka Kotebe General Hospital (EKGH) showed a relatively better preparedness compared to others. ABHR solutions should be manufactured and stored in a way that limits the risk of ignition and follows standard fire safety measures.","Selam, Muluken Nigatu; Bayisa, Regasa; Ababu, Andualem; Abdella, Mahdi; Diriba, Edessa; Wale, Minychel; Baye, Assefa Mulu",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,601,30

Here, we focused on the geomorphological effects of animals in mountain streams. This ecosystem merits conservation measures as it furnishes cold-water refugia. We searched literature addressing the impact of various animal taxa on the river/stream bed structure. The citation sources were the Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases covering 1975-early 2020. We examined all animal taxa with documented or potential zoogeomorphological effects upon streams and assigned spatiotemporal scales to their impacts. Interpreting the literature was challenging due to a lack of uniformity in data treatment between species groups and over time. Though human interactions prevail in stream channels, animals also have a substantial effect on a spatial scale and their modifications are more durable. In general, animals markedly influence aquatic habitats. This literature compilation revealed much information about the geomorphological effects of beavers, redd-building fish, and large bottom-dwelling fish. The scale of impact of invertebrates such as crayfish or case-building caddisfly larvae on stony-gravel bottoms has previously been demonstrated. However, previous research has concentrated on only one taxon and has not demonstrated the bioaccumulation effect of multiple taxa. Quantitative data have been presented only for large terrestrial mammals crossing streams. There was comparatively little information on the impact of other terrestrial taxa on stream geomorphology. There were also few or no quantitative data on the impacts of aquatic fauna on mountain stream channels. Much has been reported about the effects of burying invertebrates but relatively little is known about the impacts of burying fish such as lamprey larvae. The present review highlights numerous outstanding information gaps. It is hoped that this review will facilitate ongoing zoogeomorphological research.","Bylak, Aneta; Kukula, Krzysztof",Sci Total Environ,601,16

Even with effective vaccines, infection is possible, and at-risk populations would benefit from effective drug compounds that reduce the lethality and lasting damage of COVID-19 infection. The CoV-2 MacroD-like macrodomain (Mac1) is implicated in viral pathogenicity by disrupting host innate immunity through its mono (ADP-ribosyl) hydrolase activity, making it a prime target for antiviral therapy. We therefore solved the structure of CoV-2 Mac1 from non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) and applied structural and sequence-based genetic tracing, including newly determined A. pompejana MacroD2 and GDAP2 amino acid sequences, to compare and contrast CoV-2 Mac1 with the functionally related human DNA-damage signaling factor poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). Previously, identified targetable features of the PARG active site allowed us to develop a pharmacologically useful PARG inhibitor (PARGi). Here, we developed a focused chemical library and determined 6 novel PARGi X-ray crystal structures for comparative analysis. We applied this knowledge to discovery of CoV-2 Mac1 inhibitors by combining computation and structural analysis to identify PARGi fragments with potential to bind the distal-ribose and adenosyl pockets of the CoV-2 Mac1 active site. Scaffold development of these PARGi fragments has yielded two novel compounds, PARG-345 and PARG-329, that crystallize within the Mac1 active site, providing critical structure-activity data and a pathway for inhibitor optimization. The reported structural findings demonstrate ways to harness our PARGi synthesis and characterization pipeline to develop CoV-2 Mac1 inhibitors targeting the ADP-ribose active site. Together, these structural and computational analyses reveal a path for accelerating development of antiviral therapeutics from pre-existing drug optimization pipelines.","Brosey, Chris A; Houl, Jerry H; Katsonis, Panagiotis; Balapiti-Modarage, Lakshitha P F; Bommagani, Shobanbabu; Arvai, Andy; Moiani, Davide; Bacolla, Albino; Link, Todd; Warden, Leslie S; Lichtarge, Olivier; Jones, Darin E; Ahmed, Zamal; Tainer, John A",Prog. biophys. mol. biol,601,16

In this process, a patient who tests positive for an infectious disease and public health officials work to identify the patient's close contacts, notify them of their risk of possible exposure to the disease, and provide resources to facilitate the decreased spreading of disease. Contact notification can be done physically in person, via phone call, or digitally through the use of media such as SMS text messages and email. When alerts are made through the latter, it is called digital contact notification. OBJECTIVE: For this study, we aim to perform a preliminary evaluation of the use of the TellYourContacts website, a digital contact notification tool for COVID-19 that can be used confidentially and anonymously. We will gather information about the number of website users and message senders, the types of messages sent, and the geographic distribution of senders. METHODS: Patients who chose to get tested for COVID-19 and subsequently tested positive for the disease were alerted of their positive results through Curative Inc (a COVID-19 testing laboratory) and Healthvana (a results disclosure app). Included in the notification was a link to the TellYourContacts website and a message encouraging the person who tested positive for COVID-19 to use the website to alert their close contacts of exposure risk. Over the course of three months, from May 18, 2020, to August 17, 2020, we used Google Analytics and Microsoft Excel to record data on the number of website users and message senders, types of messages sent, and geographic distribution of the senders. RESULTS: Over the course of three months, 9130 users accessed the website and 1474 unique senders sent a total of 1957 messages, which included 1820 (93%) SMS text messages and 137 (7%) emails. Users sent messages from 40 US states, with the majority of US senders residing in California (49%). CONCLUSIONS: We set out to determine if individuals who test positive for COVID-19 will use the TellYourContacts website to notify their close contacts of COVID-19 exposure risk. Our findings reveal that, during the observation period, each unique sender sent an average of 1.33 messages. The TellYourContacts website offers an additional method that individuals can and will use to notify their close contacts about a recent COVID-19 diagnosis.","Okpara, Kelechi S; Hecht, Jennifer; Wohlfeiler, Dan; Prior, Matthew; Klausner, Jeffrey D",JMIR Form Res,601,1

METHODS: The conceptual framework of HIT-6 was evaluated using baseline data from the PROMISE-2 study (NCT02974153; N = 1072). A unidimensional graded response model within the item response theory (IRT) framework was used to evaluate model fit and item characteristics. Using baseline and week 12 data, convergent and discriminant validity of the HIT-6 was evaluated by correlation coefficients. Sensitivity to change was assessed by evaluating correlations between HIT-6 scores and change scores for other established reference measures. All examined correlations were specified a priori with respect to direction and magnitude. Known-groups analyses were anchored using Patient Global Impression of Change and monthly headache days at week 12. RESULTS: A unidimensional model fit the data well, supporting that the 6 items measure a single construct. All item slopes and thresholds were within acceptable ranges. In both the validity and sensitivity to change analyses, all observed correlations conformed to directional expectations, and most conformed to magnitude expectations. Known-groups analyses demonstrated that the HIT-6 total score can distinguish between clinically meaningful CM subgroups. CONCLUSION: The HIT-6 was successfully calibrated using IRT with data from PROMISE-2. Results from these analyses were generally consistent with previous literature and provided supportive evidence that the HIT-6 is well suited for measuring the impact of headache and migraine in the CM population.","Houts, Carrie R; McGinley, James S; Wirth, R J; Cady, Roger; Lipton, Richard B",Qual. life res,601,16

Only a minority of dermatology practices has integrated teledermatology into their practice prior to COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the barriers and facilitators may promote teledermatology adoption. Implementation science frameworks offer theoretically driven ways to assess factors affecting teledermatology implementation. This review uses a comprehensive implementation science framework to summarize barriers and facilitators of teledermatology implementation and appraises the quality of existing research. Recent Findings: Technological characteristics of teledermatology (e.g., user-friendliness) and factors within the outer setting (e.g., reimbursement and legal considerations) were the most commonly reported barriers. No existing studies use a comprehensive implementation framework to identify factors influencing teledermatology implementation. Many included studies have a risk of bias in at least two of the five study quality indices evaluated. Summary: This systematic review is the first study to summarize the existing teledermatology implementation literature into well-defined constructs from a comprehensive implementation science framework. Findings suggest future studies would benefit from the use of an implementation framework to reduce study bias, improve result comprehensiveness, facilitate comparisons across studies, and produce evidence-based resolutions to implementation barriers.

Rapid antigen tests (RATs) are considered an important addition to molecular tests in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), mainly because of their fast turnaround time, easier analytical procedure and lower price. However, real-life studies on the usefulness of such testing for screening of HCWs are limited. METHODS: Physicians, nurses and hospital attendants currently working at the University Clinic of Respiratory and Allergic Diseases Golnik were invited to participate in the pilot study. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained three times per week for two consecutive weeks and tested with a point-of-care RAT and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum samples were obtained at the beginning of the study and 2 weeks after the last swab was collected to evaluate the serological status. RESULTS: A total of 191 nasopharyngeal swabs from 36 HCWs were obtained. None of the samples tested was positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, whereas two HCWs tested positive on RT-PCR. Of these, one HCW had a newly identified SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas RT-PCR probably detected a previous but recent infection in the other HCW. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this pilot study, it is unlikely that RAT will reliably detect novel SARS-CoV-2 infections among asymptomatic HCWs despite serial sampling. Although RT-PCR-based screening of HCWs may not be feasible due to high sample volume, molecular methods may identify SARS-CoV-2-infected HCWs already during the presymptomatic stage.

Countries with higher prevalence of exposed obese individuals experienced the highest number of mortalities. The analysis also proved that individuals having more adipose tissue in body have a higher level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is identified as functional receptor for COVID-19. Therefore, obese individuals are worse in condition because of a higher presence of adiposity increases the number of ACE2 expressing cells. Furthermore, in silico interactions of ACE2 and different variants of coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) spike S1 protein suggest that mutant strains are more infectious than wildtype as they bind to host ACE2 protein with high binding affinities. Certain specific cancers including cervical cancer, pancreatic and rectal adenocarcinomas have more expression of such receptors and pose additional risk to already immunocompromised cancer patients.

Here we compared the epidemiological characteristics of laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases with COVID-19 in Wuhan. METHODS: Demographics, case severity and outcomes of 29,886 confirmed cases and 21,960 clinically diagnosed cases reported between December 2019 and February 24, 2020, were compared. The risk factors were estimated, and the effective reproduction number (Rt) of SARS-CoV-2 was also calculated. RESULTS: The age and occupation distribution of confirmed cases and clinically diagnosed cases were consistent, and their sex ratio were 1.0 and 0.9, respectively. The epidemic curve of clinical diagnosis cases was similar to that of confirmed cases, and the city centers had more cumulative cases and higher incidence density than suburbs in both of two groups. The proportion of severe and critical cases (21.5 % vs. 14.0 %, P < 0.0001) and case fatality rates (5.2 % vs. 1.2 %, P < 0.0001) of confirmed cases were all higher than those of clinically diagnosed cases. Risk factors for death we observed in both of two groups were older age, male, severe or critical cases. Rt showed the same trend in two groups, it dropped below 1.0 on February 6 among confirmed cases, and February 8 among clinically diagnosed cases. CONCLUSIONS: The demographic characteristics and spatiotemporal distributions of confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases are roughly similar, but the disease severity and clinical outcome of clinically diagnosed cases are better than those of confirmed cases. In cases when detection kits are insufficient during the early epidemic, the implementation of clinical diagnosis is necessary and effective.","Shi, Fang; Wen, Haoyu; Liu, Rui; Bai, Jianjun; Wang, Fang; Mubarik, Sumaira; Liu, Xiaoxue; Yu, Yong; Hong, Qiumian; Cao, Jinhong; Yu, Chuanhua",Glob Health Res Policy,601,11

However, many current computational methods of such calculations are either inefficient or inaccurate in practice. Utilizing implicit solvent models in the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) framework allows for efficient calculations without significant loss of accuracy. Here, GBNSR6, a new flavor of the generalized Born model, is employed in the MM/GBSA framework for measuring the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor. A computational protocol is developed based on the widely studied Ras-Raf complex, which has similar binding free energy to SARS-CoV-2/ACE2. Two options for representing the dielectric boundary of the complexes are evaluated: one based on the standard Bondi radii and the other based on a newly developed set of atomic radii (OPT1), optimized specifically for protein-ligand binding. Predictions based on the two radii sets provide upper and lower bounds on the experimental references: -14.7(&#916;GbindBondi)<-10.6(&#916;GbindExp.)<-4.1(&#916;GbindOPT1) kcal/mol. The consensus estimates of the two bounds show quantitative agreement with the experiment values. This work also presents a novel truncation method and computational strategies for efficient entropy calculations with normal mode analysis. Interestingly, it is observed that a significant decrease in the number of snapshots does not affect the accuracy of entropy calculation, while it does lower computation time appreciably. The proposed MM/GBSA protocol can be used to study the binding mechanism of new variants of SARS-CoV-2, as well as other relevant structures.","Forouzesh, Negin; Mishra, Nikita",Molecules (Basel),601,16

For this, the experimental conditions were optimized to obtain an efficient, sensitive, reversible, and highly selective chemosensor to Cu2+ ions. The complex stoichiometry was 1:1, with a formation constant of 5.82â¯×â¯102â¯Lâ¯mol-1 and molar absorptivity of 5.82â¯×â¯103â¯molâ¯L-1â¯cm-1. Then, a spectrophotometric analytical method was developed and validated according to the Brazilian legislation. The linearity of the analytical curve was demonstrated by ANOVA, at a confidence level of 95%. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.0659 and 0.200â¯mgâ¯L-1, respectively. The coefficients of variation for both the intra- and inter-day precisions were lower than 3.83%, and the accuracy presented a mean recovery of 100.55â¯±â¯2.87%.

This result was in accordance with the Brazilian legislation but reinforces the need to carry out stricter quality control to achieve exportation standards. Therefore, the proposed method can be considered a simple, selective, linear, precise, and accurate tool that involves only a simple complexation reaction through the addition of the chemosensor solution in a buffered medium. As a consequence, the simplicity, practicality, rapidity, and low cost of synthesis of the proposed Schiff base chemosensor are highlighted.","Onça, Larissa Oliveira; de Souza, Joseana Caroline Palmeira; Dos Santos, Izabela Gessyane Nogueira; Santos, Emerson de Sousa; Soares, Sérgio Macêdo; Diniz, Paulo Henrique Gonçalves Dias",Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,601,15

Carried out from April 24 to May 24, 2020, the survey recruited participants by a chain sampling procedure. Its outcome was the worsening of self-rated health during the pandemic. Statistical analysis was based on a hierarchical model of determination. Logistic regression models were used to test the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, pre-existing health conditions, lifestyle indicators and intensity of social restraint measures, and biological and psychological issues during the pandemic. From the total sample of 45,161 participants, 29.4% reported worsening of health state during this period. After adjusting for hierarchical distal factors, the health problems mostly associated with worsening health state were: bad self-rated health (adjusted OR = 4.35, p &lt; 0.001), health care seeking for mental health problem (adjusted OR = 3.95, p &lt; 0.001), and for COVID-19 (adjusted OR = 3.60, p &lt; 0.001). People who experienced sleep problems, worsening of back pain, depression and at least one flu symptom during the pandemic were twice as likely to report worsening of health status. Sedentary and eating behaviors and adherence to social distancing measures showed significant correlation with the outcome.

The major limitation to overcome the issue is the lack of potential vaccines or effective medicines to treat or control the disease. Considering the shortness of time to act, the purpose of the paper was to identify and categorise the climatic, socio-biological factors that influence the global super-spread of the epidemic using a theory building approach, ‘Total Interpretive Structural Modelling’ (TISM). MICMAC analysis of the identified factors, based on their interdependence categorized the triggering factors, air temperature, humidity, age, airflow and ventilation, responsible for the increased mortality rate of COVID 19 compared to SARS and MERS. So the model explains why the temperate countries of similar climatic zones and aged people are more vulnerable. It also predicts the susceptibility of countries based on their geographic locations and upcoming climatic conditions which were found to be influential in sustaining longevity and aerosol spread of the virus. Since many of these factors remain unaltered or out of human control, the linkage factors identified in this paper; change in host behaviour and number of contacts can be given priorities in order to overcome the situation. Furthermore, this is the first attempt made to understand epidemiological characteristics of COVID 19 using TISM approach.","Lakshmi Priyadarsini, S.; Suresh, M.",Int. J. Healthc. Manage.,601,16

AIM: We aimed to examine the effects of social distancing, loneliness, difficulties in emotion regulation, and self-regulation on participants self-reported coping using sex during lockdown in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Participants had to be residents of the United Kingdom, aged between 18-60 years, fluent in English, and had to have an Internet connection. They were instructed not to participate if they had consumed alcohol in the previous 24 hours. A total of 789 participants aged 18-59 years completed an online survey. Participants provided self-report measures of social distancing, loneliness, and difficulties in emotion regulation. A Go/No-Go task was used to assess self-regulation. OUTCOMES: Participants self-reported their use of sex to cope over a 14-day period during lockdown, as well as retrospectively for a 14-day period immediately preceding lockdown. Coping using sex items included consensual and non-consensual themes. RESULTS: Overall, there was no increase in coping using sex during lockdown compared with before lockdown. Findings showed that 30% of participants reported increased coping using sex during lockdown compared with before, 29% reported decreased coping using sex, and 41% reported no change. All regression models included age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis of psychiatric condition, level of education, being at high-risk for difficulties relating to COVID-19, living alone, and diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 as covariates. Being younger, being male, and greater emotion dysregulation were associated with higher coping using sex total and consent subscale scores during lockdown. Being younger, being male, not living alone, and less adherence to social distancing advice were associated with coping using sex with a theme of rape/violence during lockdown. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: A proportion of participants used sex to cope more often during lockdown compared with before. Less adherence to social distancing advice and emotion dysregulation were associated with using sex to cope during lockdown. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Strengths of this study were the large sample size and inclusion of key sociodemographic characteristics as covariates. The main limitations were the cross-sectional design and a sample that was mostly white, educated, and female. CONCLUSION: Participants who had difficulty regulating emotions were more likely to use sex to cope. It is important that support is available for people who have problems regulating their emotions during the pandemic and that they have access to appropriate help and advice.

Herein, we isolated a strain of Lactobacillus paracasei R3 (L.p R3) with strong biofilm formation ability from infant feces. Interestingly, we also found L.p R3 strain can ameliorate the general symptoms of murine colitis, alleviate inflammatory cell infiltration and inhibit Th17 while promote Treg function in murine dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Overall, this study suggested that L.p R3 strain significantly improves the symptoms and the pathological damage of mice with colitis and influences the immune function by regulating Th17/Treg cell balance in DSS-induced colitis in mice.","Huang, Juan; Yang, Ziyan; Li, Yanyun; Chai, Xingxing; Liang, Yanfang; Lin, Bihua; Ye, Ziyu; Zhang, Shaobing; Che, Zhengping; Zhang, Hailiang; Zhang, Xueying; Zhang, Zhao; Chen, Tao; Yang, Weiqing; Zeng, Jincheng",J Transl Med,601,17

In addition, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China have the potential to provide evidence to support other metropolitan areas and large cities outside China with their emerging cases. We used data reported from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020, to fit a model of infection, estimate the likely number of infections in four high-risk metropolitan areas based on the number of cases reported, and increase the understanding of the COVID-19 spread pattern. Considering the effect of the official quarantine regulations and travel restrictions for China, which began January 23~24, 2020, we used the daily travel intensity index from the Baidu Maps app to roughly simulate the level of restrictions and estimate the proportion of the quarantined population. A group of SEIR model statistical parameters were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and fitting on the basis of reported data. As a result, we estimated that the basic reproductive number, R0, was 2.91 in Beijing, 2.78 in Shanghai, 2.02 in Guangzhou, and 1.75 in Shenzhen based on the data from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020. In addition, we inferred the prediction results and compared the results of different levels of parameters. For example, in Beijing, the predicted peak number of cases was 467 with a peak time of March 01, 2020; however, if the city were to implement different levels (strict, moderate, or weak) of travel restrictions or regulation measures, the estimation results showed that the transmission dynamics would change and that the peak number of cases would differ by between 54% and 209%. We concluded that public health interventions would reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and that more rigorous control and prevention measures would effectively contain its further spread, and awareness of prevention should be enhanced when businesses and social activities return to normal before the end of the epidemic. Further, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China offer the potential to provide evidence supporting other metropolitan areas and big cities with their emerging cases outside China.","Su, Longxiang; Hong, Na; Zhou, Xiang; He, Jie; Ma, Yingying; Jiang, Huizhen; Han, Lin; Chang, Fengxiang; Shan, Guangliang; Zhu, Weiguo; Long, Yun",Front.

This study was performed in the surgical department of COVID hospital on the basis of the Clinical Hospital No. 4 of the First Moscow State Medical University named I.M. Sechenov (Sechenov University). During the period from April 2020 to February 2021, 32 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and the presence of venous trophic ulcers (VTU) of the lower extremities were treated. All patients underwent complex therapy for viral pneumonia in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. The protease inhibitor Aprotinin (Gordox ™) was used to improve microcirculation and prevent the development of a ""cytokine storm"". To accelerate the cleansing and epithelialization of venous trophic ulcers, the surface of the trophic ulcer was treated with an air plasma flow of NO and injections into the trophic ulcer of autoplasma. Against the background of complex treatment, all patients showed positive dynamics of the clinical picture: relief of hyperthermia, increase or stabilization of SpO2 values from 95% and above, significant decrease in CRP, LDH, D-dimer indices, increase in the number of lymphocytes, decrease in the VTU area by 1.5 times, active granulation and marginal epithelialization of the ulcer. In 14 patients (43.8%), complete epithelialization of the VTU defect was noted by the end of the third week. According to the CIVIQ-20 questionnaire, all 32 patients participating in the study showed positive dynamics. There were no lethal outcomes. Multicomponent therapy of decompensated forms of CVI of the lower extremities in the COVID hospital in patients with moderate severity of coronavirus infection with the use of proteolysis inhibitors leads to a rapid relief of symptoms of intoxication, prevents the progression of lung tissue and parenchymal organ damage and contributes to the positive dynamics of healing of ulcerative defects in the vast majority of patients.","Krylov, A.; Khorobrykh, T.; Petrovskaya, A.; Gandybina, E.; Gogokhia, T.; Mansurova, G.",Georgian Med News,601,5

METHODS: A total of 100 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in intensive care unit (ICU) were enrolled and classified into moderate (n=17), severe (n=40) and critical groups (n=43). Clinical information and laboratory results were collected and the concentrations of ferritin were compared among different groups. The association between ferritin and mortality was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Moreover, the efficiency of the predicting value was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: The amount of ferritin was significantly higher in critical group compared with moderate and severe groups. The median of ferritin concentration was about three times higher in death group than survival group (1722.25µg/L vs. 501.90µg/L, p<0.01). The concentration of ferritin was positively correlated with other inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that ferritin was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. Especially, high-ferritin group was associated with higher incidence of mortality, with adjusted odds ratio of 104.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.63-4185.89; p=0.013]. Moreover, ferritin had an advantage of discriminative capacity with the area under ROC (AUC) of 0.822 (95% CI 0.737-0.907) higher than procalcitonin and CRP. CONCLUSION: The ferritin measured at admission may serve as an independent factor for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 in ICU.","Deng, Fuxue; Zhang, Lisha; Lyu, Lyu; Lu, Ziwei; Gao, Dengfeng; Ma, Xiaorong; Guo, Yonghong; Wang, Rong; Gong, Shouping; Jiang, Wei",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),601,6

Characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and PE suspicion who required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) were also analysed. METHODS: A retrospective study from March 18, 2020, until April 11, 2020. Inclusion criteria were patients with suspected PE and positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. Exclusion criteria were negative or inconclusive RT-PCR and other chest CT indications. CTPA features were evaluated and severity scores, presence, and localisation of PE were reported. D-dimer and IL-6 determinations, ICU admission, and previous antithrombotic treatment were registered. RESULTS: Forty-seven PE suspicions with confirmed COVID-19 underwent CTPA. Sixteen patients were diagnosed with PE with a predominant segmental distribution. Statistically significant differences were found in the highest D-dimer determination in patients with PE and ICU admission regarding elevated IL-6 values. CONCLUSION: PE in COVID-19 patients in our series might predominantly affect segmental arteries and the right lung. Results suggest that the higher the D-dimer concentration, the greater the likelihood of PE. Both assumptions should be assessed in future studies with a larger sample size. KEY POINTS: â¢ On CT pulmonary angiography, pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients seems to be predominantly distributed in segmental arteries of the right lung, an assumption that needs to be approached in future research. â¢ Only the highest intraindividual determination of d-dimer from admission to CT scan seems to differentiate patients with pulmonary embolism from patients with a negative CTPA. However, interindividual variability calls for future studies to establish cut-off values in COVID-19 patients. â¢ Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to determine whether the presence of PE could increase the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in COVID-19 patients.","Espallargas, Irene; Rodríguez Sevilla, Juan José; Rodríguez Chiaradía, Diego Agustín; Salar, Antonio; Casamayor, Guillem; Villar-Garcia, Judit; Rodó-Pin, Anna; Marsico, Salvatore; Carbullanca, Santiago; Ramal, Diego; Del Carpio, Luis Alexander; Gayete, Ángel; Maiques, José María; Zuccarino, Flavio",Eur. radiol,601,1

This study examined how parental worry and family-based disaster education related to children's internalizing and externalizing problems during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Method: Parents reported parental worry, family-based disaster education and their children's (5-8-year-old young elementary schoolchildren [n = 245] and 245 9-13-year-old early adolescents [n = 245]) internalizing and externalizing problems. Results: Data analysis showed that (a) across ages, parental worry related to children's internalizing and externalizing problems significantly and positively; (b) the significant and negative relationships between family-based disaster education and internalizing and externalizing problems were only supported in young elementary schoolchildren; and (c) high level of parent worry attenuated the negative link between family-based disaster education and young elementary schoolchildren's internalizing problems. Conclusion: This study expands our knowledge about relationships between parental worry and children's disaster-related well-being, and highlights the importance of adapting family-based disaster education to different ages. Data suggest that parents of young elementary schoolchildren and early adolescents both should avoid showing excessive worry in front of their children during the pandemic to help reduce their children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Effective family-based disaster education can mitigate young elementary schoolchildren's emotional distress and behavioral problems, the effect of which may be maximized if parents can avoid being overly worried. Parents of early adolescents should support their children in acquiring pandemic-related information independently and encourage them to seek support outside the family.

Vaccines are often considered as a cost-effective way to prevent and control infectious diseases, and the research and development of COVID-19 vaccines have been progressing unprecedently. It is needed to understand individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) among general population, which provides information about social demand, access and financing for future COVID-19 vaccination. OBJECTIVE: To investigate individuals' WTP and financing mechanism preference for COVID-19 vaccination during the pandemic period in China. METHODS: During March 1-18, 2020, we conducted a network stratified random sampling survey with 2058 respondents in China. The survey questionnaires included out-of-pocket WTP, financing mechanism preference as well as basic characteristics of the respondents; risk perception and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; attitude for future COVID-19 vaccination. Multivariable Tobit regression was used to determine impact factors for respondents' out-of-pocket WTP. RESULTS: The individuals' mean WTP for full COVID-19 vaccination was CNY 254 (USD 36.8) with median of CNY 100 (USD 14.5). Most respondents believed that governments (90.9%) and health insurance (78.0%) needed to pay for some or full portions of COVID-19 vaccination, although 84.3% stated that individuals needed to pay. Annual family income, employee size in the workplace, and whether considering the COVID-19 pandemic in China in a declining trend affected respondents' WTP significantly. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrated the individuals' WTP for COVID-19 vaccination in China and their preferences for financing sources from individuals, governments and health insurance. And to suggest an effective and optimal financing strategy, the public health perspective with equal access to COVID-19 vaccination should be prioritized to ensure a high vaccination rate.","Wang, Jiahao; Lyu, Yun; Zhang, Haijun; Jing, Rize; Lai, Xiaozhen; Feng, Huangyufei; Knoll, Maria Deloria; Fang, Hai",Vaccine,601,16

Should campaigns to promote protective behaviors focus on debunking misinformation or targeting behavior-specific beliefs? To address this question, we examine whether belief in COVID-19 misinformation is directly associated with two behaviors (face mask wearing and social distancing), and whether behavior-specific beliefs can account for this association and better predict behavior, consistent with behavior-change theory. We conducted a nationally representative two-wave survey of U.S. adults from 5/26/20-6/12/20 (n = 1074) and 7/15/20-7/21//20 (n = 889; follow-up response 83%). Scales were developed and validated for COVID-19 related misinformation beliefs, social distancing and face mask wearing, and beliefs about the consequences of both behaviors. Cross-lagged panel linear regression models assessed relationships among the variables. While belief in misinformation was negatively associated with both face mask wearing (B = -.27, SE =.06) and social-distancing behaviors (B = -.46, SE =.08) measured at the same time, misinformation did not predict concurrent or lagged behavior when the behavior-specific beliefs were incorporated in the models. Beliefs about behavioral outcomes accounted for face mask wearing and social distancing, both cross-sectionally (B =.43, SE =.05; B =.63, SE =.09) and lagged over time (B =.20, SE = 04; B =.30, SE =.08). In conclusion, belief in COVID-19-related misinformation is less relevant to protective behaviors, but beliefs about the consequences of these behaviors are important predictors. With regard to misinformation, we recommend health campaigns aimed at promoting protective behaviors emphasize the benefits of these behaviors, rather than debunking unrelated false claims.","Hornik, Robert; Kikut, Ava; Jesch, Emma; Woko, Chioma; Siegel, Leeann; Kim, Kwanho",Health Commun,601,15

A wide range of variations in the clinical symptoms of different patients attributed to genomic differences. Therefore, personalized treatments seem to play a critical role in improving these symptoms and even similar conditions. Prompted by the uncertainties in the area of COVID-19 therapies, we reviewed the published papers and concepts to gather and provide useful information to clinicians and researchers interested in personalized medicine and cell-based therapy. One novel aspect of this study focuses on the potential application of personalized medicine in treating severe cases of COVID-19. However, it is theoretical, as any real-world examples of the use of genuinely personalized medicine have not existed yet. Nevertheless, we know that stem cells, especially MSCs, have immune-modulatory effects and can be stored for future personalized medicine applications. This theory has been conjugated with some evidence that we review in the present study. Besides, we discuss the importance of personalized medicine and its possible aspects in COVID-19 treatment, then review the cell-based therapy studies for COVID-19 with a particular focus on stem cell-based therapies as a primary personalized tool medicine. However, the idea of cell-based therapy has not been accepted by several scientific communities due to some concerns of lack of satisfactory clinical studies; still, the MSCs and their clinical outcomes have been revealed the safety and potency of this therapeutic approach in several diseases, especially in the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and some incurable diseases.

These problems can lead to psychological problems. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis to ascertain the present impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance among nurses. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The following databases were searched: PubMed, CHINAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MedRxiv and Google Scholar, from January 2020 up to 26th October 2020. Prevalence rates were pooled with meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using I-squared (I2) statistics. RESULTS: A total of 93 studies (n = 93,112), published between January 2020 and September 2020, met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of stress was assessed in 40 studies which accounted for 43% (95% CI 37-49). The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 37% (95% CI 32-41) in 73 studies. Depression was assessed in 62 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 35% (95% CI 31-39). Finally, 18 studies assessed sleep disturbance and the pooled prevalence was 43% (95% CI 36-50). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis found that approximately one third of nurses working during the COVID-19 epidemic were suffering from psychological symptoms. This highlights the importance of providing comprehensive support strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among nurses under pandemic conditions. Further longitudinal study is needed to distinguish of psychological symptoms during and after the infectious disease outbreaks.","Al Maqbali, Mohammed; Al Sinani, Mohammed; Al-Lenjawi, Badriya",J Psychosom Res,601,16

This study aims to examine the current hand hygiene behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, post pandemic behavior intentions, and the relationship between behavior, psychosocial and contextual factors. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 28 May to 12 June 2020, with 896 valid responses obtained from Indonesian citizens over 18 years old. The survey questions included demographic characteristics, individual practices, risk perceptions, attitude, norm factors and ability factors related to hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive analysis, chi square and multiple logistic regression tests were used to analyse the data. The results showed that 82.32% of female respondents and 73.37% male respondents reported handwashing practice 8 times or more per day during COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who perceived themselves at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (OR 7.08, 2.26-22.17), had less negative perception toward the practice (OR 1.93, 1.32-2.82), perceived handwashing as an effective preventive measure (OR 1.77, 1.23-2.54), were female (OR 1.71, 1.21-2.41), perceived a more supportive norm (OR 1.68, 1.15-2.44) and noticed more barriers in access to handwashing facilities (OR 1.57, 1.05-2.36) were more likely to engage in hand hygiene practice more frequently during the pandemic. In conclusion, the majority of respondents did increase their frequency of hand hygiene practices during COVID-19 pandemic. In line with previous studies in other pandemic contexts, sex, perceived susceptibility and effectiveness are important predictors of hand hygiene practices, which are similar to findings from previous studies in other pandemic contexts. Addressing social norm related to the perceived hand hygiene practices of friends and important people is a potential health promotion strategy by creating hand hygiene norms in the community.","Dwipayanti, Ni Made Utami; Lubis, Dinar Saurmauli; Harjana, Ngakan Putu Anom",Front Public Health,601,33

Several factors influencing risk perception have been identified, including knowledge of the disease, information sources, and emotional states. Prior studies on COVID-19-related risk perception primarily focused on the general public, with little data available on COVID-19 patients. PURPOSE: To investigate COVID-19 patients' risk perception, knowledge of the disease, information sources, and emotional states in the epicenter, Wuhan, during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: Data were collected online using self-administered electronic questionnaire developed with reference to previous relevant studies and publications by the World Health Organization. FINDINGS: A higher level of perceived risk was found in relation to COVID-19 as compared to other potential health threats. Knowledge gaps existed regarding transmission and prevention of COVID-19. Additionally, risk perception was negatively related to knowledge and positively related to depressive states. Moreover, social media was a primary source for COVID-19 information, whereas the most trusted sources were health professionals. DISCUSSION: Realistic perception of risk should be encouraged considering both physical and mental health while developing relevant strategies. Furthermore, risk communication needs to be specifically tailored for various target groups, such as the elderly and mentally vulnerable individuals, with the adoption of popular media platforms.","Zhong, Yaping; Liu, Weihua; Lee, Tsorng-Yeh; Zhao, Huan; Ji, Ji",Nurs. outlook,601,33

We detailed the evolution of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Lot-et-Garonne department and the rest of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. RESULTS: Among the 89 screened individuals, 10 new cases were confirmed, including 4 asymptomatic persons. In Lot-et-Garonne, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases immediately decreased after this screening and no epidemic peak occurred, contrary to what was observed in the rest of the region. CONCLUSION: The early screening of high-risk contacts of COVID-19 cases and members of their household implemented a few days before the first lockdown probably helped to prevent the spread of the virus in the department.","Gault, Gaëlle; Monpierre, Olivier; Carion, Gaetane; Rispal, Patrick; Royer, Hélène; Lafon, Marie-Edith; Habold, Daniel; Filleul, Laurent",Infect Dis Now,601,16

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), 4,-4'-azobis-4-cyanopentanoyl chloride (ACPC), and methacryloyl chloride were reacted via bulk condensation polymerization to synthesize the macroinimer. The organogel systems were then prepared with macroinimer using different acrylic monomers of methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, and butyl acrylate without any additional crosslinker and initiator. The structural properties of the obtained final products were characterized by FT-IR, 1H-NMR, and TGA. The effect of alkyl chain length and macroinimer moieties in the organogel networks, as well as the swelling capacities of the prepared gels, was evaluated for different organic solvents and oils. The maximum solvent absorbencies of macroinimer-based organogels were determined as 85.3%, 100.9%, 1422.1%, 1660.0%, 3809.3%, and 5032.2% for diesel oil, gasoline, acetone, benzene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dichloromethane (DCM), respectively. Furthermore, adsorption-desorption kinetics, selective absorption from oil/water mixtures, temperature effect on the absorption capacity, and reusability tests were investigated. Obtained results showed that the prepared organogels possessed high swelling, efficient absorption capacity, and good oil separation performance in the removal of organic solvents from wastewater. The temperature-dependent absorption study shows no significant change in absorption capacity. Thus, the prepared macroinimer-based organogels in the present study demonstrate potential as prospective sorbents for organic pollutant cleanup from wastewater.","Erdem, Ahmet; Mammadli, Nigar; Yildiz, Ufuk",,601,1

The objective of this study was to analyse the efficacy of telemedicine (by telephone) in monitoring patients in a coloproctology unit, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method Prospective descriptive study of consecutive patients in a single centre. The result of the teleconsultation was classified as discharge, resolved visit or reprogramming and was analysed by different diagnostic groups. Results From March 19th to April 17th, 2020, the teleconsultation of 190 patients was carried out. The response rate was 94.2% (179). The diagnostic categories of the patients attended were: 51 (26.9%) colorectal neoplasia, 48 (25.3%) proctological pathology, 72 (37.9%) pelvic floor dysfunctions and 19 (10%) other benign pathologies. 105 (55.26%) could be recited as if they had come in person. Eleven (5.8%) patients were discharged. No significant differences were found between the different diagnostic categories and the resolution of the teleconsultation. The reasons for reprogramming are analyzed in the study. Conclusion In the context of a pandemic, teleconsultation has allowed 61% of follow-up visits to be definitively solved, avoiding the reprogramming of 116 patients. The new social and health paradigm after the pandemic will require a rethinking of our healthcare model, and in many aspects, telemedicine can offer tools for this. Resumen Introducción Durante el estado de alarma sanitaria establecido a causa de la pandemia de la COVID-19 se anularon la mayor parte de las consultas externas presenciales y se estableció una consulta telefónica para el seguimiento de pacientes coloproctológicos. El objetivo de este estudio fue analizar la eficacia de la consulta telefónica (teleconsulta) en el seguimiento de los pacientes de una unidad de coloproctología, en el contexto de la pandemia de COVID-19. Método Estudio descriptivo prospectivo de pacientes consecutivos en un solo centro.

This index ranked 195 countries according to their expected preparedness in the case of a pandemic or other biological threat. The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic provides the background to compare each country's predicted performance from the GHSI with the actual performance. In general, there is an inverted relation between predicted versus actual performance, i.e. the predicted top performers are among those that are the worst hit. Obviously, this reflects poorly on the potential policy uses of this index in imminent crisis management. METHODS: The paper analyses the GHSI and identifies why it may have struggled to predict actual pandemic preparedness as evidenced by the Covid-19 pandemic. The paper also uses two different data sets, one from the Worldmeter on the spread of the Covid-19 pandemics, and the other from the International Network for Government Science Advice (INGSA) Evidence-to-Policy Tracker, to draw comparisons between the actual introduction of pandemic response policies and the corresponding death rate in 29 selected countries. RESULTS: This paper analyses the reasons for the poor match between prediction and reality in the index, and mentions six general observations applying to global indices in this respect. These observations are based on methodological and conceptual analyses. The level of abstraction in these global indices builds uncertainties upon uncertainties and hides implicit value assumptions, which potentially removes them from the policy needs on the ground. CONCLUSIONS: From the analysis, the question is raised if the policy community might have better tools for decision-making in a pandemic. On the basis of data from the INGSA Evidence-to-Policy Tracker, and with backing in studies from social psychology and philosophy of science, some simple heuristics are suggested, which may be more useful than a global index.","Kaiser, Matthias; Chen, Andrew Tzer-Yeu; Gluckman, Peter",Health Res Policy Syst,601,18

Eighty RA patients were randomized to tocilizumab (n = 40) or conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and glucocorticoids (GC) (n = 40) for 3 months. Forty healthy subjects with similar age and sex served as controls. We measured: (a)perfused boundary region (PBR) of the sublingual arterial microvessels (increased PBR indicates reduced glycocalyx thickness), (b)pulse wave velocity (PWV), (c)global LV longitudinal strain (GLS), (d)global work index (GWI) using speckle tracking echocardiography and e)C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls (PCs) as oxidative stress markers at baseline and post-treatment. Compared to controls, RA patients had impaired glycocalyx and myocardial deformation markers (P < 0.05). Compared with baseline, tocilizumab reduced PBR(2.14 ± 0.2 versus 1.97 ± 0.2 µm; P < 0.05) while no significant differences were observed post-csDMARDs + GC(P > 0.05). Compared with csDMARDs + GC, tocilizumab achieved a greater increase of GLS, GWI and reduction of MDA, PCs and CRP(P < 0.05). The percent improvement of glycocalyx thickness (PBR) was associated with the percent decrease of PWV, MDA, PCs and the percent improvement of GLS and GWI(P < 0.05). Tocilizumab improves endothelial function leading to a greater increase of effective myocardial work than csDMARDs + GC through a profound reduction of inflammatory burden and oxidative stress.

We developed an adjusted model with two novel features: the asymptomatic population and threshold behavior in recovery. Unbiased parameter estimation identified faithful model fitting. Our model predicted that the epidemic for asymptomatic patients (ASP) was similar in both provinces. The latent periods and outbreak sizes are extremely sensitive to strongly controlled interventions such as isolation and quarantine for both asymptomatic and imported cases. We predicted that ASP serve as a more severe factor with faster outbreaks and larger outbreak sizes compared with imported patients. Therefore, we argued that the currently strict interventions should be continuously implemented, and unraveling the asymptomatic pool is critically important before preventive strategy such as vaccines.","Sun, Tingzhe; Weng, Dan",J. med. virol,601,20

COVID-19 accelerated the adoption of telehealth across many medical specialties. The purpose of this study was to examine telehealth utilization and satisfaction among pediatric physiatrists. METHODS: Using Google Forms, a voluntary survey was created and administered to pediatric physiatrists. The survey collected information on practice setting, telehealth utilization, provider satisfaction, perceived satisfaction of patients and families, and the anticipated role of telehealth in pediatric rehabilitation going forward. RESULTS: Seventy-eight respondents completed the survey. There was a significant reported increase in telehealth utilization since COVID-19 from 14.5% to 97.4%. Eighty-two percent of participants reported feeling comfortable utilizing telehealth, 77% felt confident in the quality of the care provided, and 91% believed patients were satisfied with telehealth visits. Responses indicate that telehealth is expected to play a role in future pediatric physiatry and interest in telehealth continuing medical education is prevalent. Most pediatric physiatrists plan to continue or expand telehealth offerings after COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Telehealth adoption has been expedited by COVID-19. Physician interest in and satisfaction with telehealth is high.

In this study, the impact of the social distancing measures on the concentrations of the three main primary air pollutants (PM10, NO2 and CO) was analyzed. CO levels showed the most significant reductions (up to 100%) since it is related to light-duty vehicular emissions. NO2 also showed reductions (9.1%-41.8%) while PM10 levels were only reduced in the 1st lockdown week. The decrease of pollutants was not directly proportional to the vehicular flux reduction, because it depends on other factors such as the transport of air masses from industrial and rural areas. The differences observed can be explained considering the fleet characteristics in the two cities and the response of the population to the social distancing recommendations.","Siciliano, Bruno; Carvalho, Giovanna; da Silva, Cleyton Martins; Arbilla, Graciela",Bull Environ Contam Toxicol,601,16

Methods: A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) identified 18 (from a total of 1398) relevant studies. Pooled current smoking prevalence was compared with the gender-adjusted and gender and age-adjusted, population-based expected prevalence by calculating prevalence odds ratio (POR). The association between current, compared with non-current and former, smoking and adverse outcome was examined. A secondary analysis was performed by including 12 pre-publications (30 studies in total). All analyses were performed using random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Among 6515 patients, the pooled prevalence of current smoking was 6.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.8–9.1%]. The gender-adjusted POR was 0.20 (95% CI: 0.16–0.25, p &lt; 0.001), and the gender and age-adjusted POR was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.19–0.30, p &lt; 0.001). Current smokers were more likely to have an adverse outcome compared with non-current smokers [odds ratio (OR): 1.53, 95%CI: 1.06–2.20, p = 0.022] but less likely compared with former smokers (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.27–0.74, p = 0.003). When pre-publications were added (n = 10,631), the gender-adjusted POR was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.19–0.38, p &lt; 0.001) and the gender and age-adjusted POR was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.24–0.48, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This meta-analysis of retrospective observational case series found an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Hospitalized current smokers had higher odds compared with non-current smokers but lower odds compared with former smokers for an adverse outcome. Smoking cannot be considered a protective measure for COVID-19. However, the hypothesis that nicotine may have a protective effect in COVID-19 that is partially masked by smoking-related toxicity and by the abrupt cessation of nicotine intake when smokers are hospitalized should be explored in laboratory studies and clinical trials using pharmaceutical nicotine products.","Farsalinos, Konstantinos; Barbouni, Anastasia; Poulas, Konstantinos; Polosa, Riccardo; Caponnetto, Pasquale; Niaura, Raymond",Ther.

Despite recent advances in understanding NOB physiology and taxonomy, there are currently very few cultured NOB or representative NOB genome sequences from marine environments. In this study, we employed enrichment culturing and genomic approaches in order to shed light on the phylogeny and metabolic capacity of marine NOB. We successfully enriched two marine NOB (designated MSP and DJ) and obtained a high-quality metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) from each organism. The maximum nitrite oxidation rates of the MSP and DJ enrichment cultures were 13.8 (0.1 mM nitrite as optimum) and 30.0 µM (0.3 mM nitrite) nitrite per day, respectively. Each enrichment culture exhibited different tolerance to varying nitrite and salt concentrations. Based on phylogenomic position and overall genome relatedness indices, both NOB MAGs were proposed as novel taxa within the Nitrospinota and Nitrospirota phyla. Functional predictions indicated that both NOB MAGs shared many highly conserve metabolic features with other NOB. Both NOB MAGs encoded proteins for hydrogen and organic compound metabolism and defense mechanisms for oxidative stress. Additionally, these organisms may have the genetic potential to produce cobalamin (an essential enzyme cofactor that is limiting in many environments) and thus may play an important role in recycling cobalamin in marine sediment. Overall, this study appreciably expands our understanding of the Nitrospinota and Nitrospirota phyla, and suggests that these NOB may play important biogeochemical roles in marine habitats.Importance Nitrification is a key process in the biogeochemical and global nitrogen cycle. Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) perform the second step of aerobic nitrification (converting nitrite to nitrate), which is critical for transferring nitrogen to other organisms for assimilation or energy. Despite their ecological importance, there are few cultured or genomic representatives from marine systems. Here, we obtained two NOB (designated as MSP and DJ) enriched from marine sediments and estimated the physiological and genomic traits of these marine microbes. Both NOB enrichment cultures exhibit distinct responses to varying nitrite and salt concentrations. Genomic analyses suggest that these NOB are metabolically flexible (similar to other previously described NOB), and yet also have individual genomic differences that likely support distinct niche distribution. In conclusion, this study provides more insights into the ecological roles of NOB in marine environments.","Park, Soo-Je; Andrei, Adrian-Stefan; Bulzu, Paul-Adrian; Kavagutti, Vinicius S; Ghai, Rohit; Mosier, Annika C",,601,16

There is evidence indicating that these drugs upregulate ACE2, a key component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and is found on the cells of a number of tissues, including the epithelial cells in the lungs. While ACE2 has a beneficial role in many diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, it also serves as a receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 via binding with the spike protein of the virus, thereby allowing it entry into host cells. Thus, it has been suggested that these therapies can theoretically increase the risk of SARS- CoV-2 infection and cause more severe COVID-19. Given the success of ACEi and ARBs in cardiovascular diseases, we seek to gain insights into the implications of these medications in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. To that end, we have developed a mathematical model that represents the RAS, binding of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent cell entry, and the host's acute inflammatory response. The model can simulate different levels of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and represent the effect of commonly prescribed anti-hypertensive medications, ACEi and ARB, and predict tissue damage. Model simulations indicate that whether the extent of tissue damage may be exacerbated by ACEi or ARB treatment depends on a number of factors, including the level of existing inflammation, dosage, and the effect of the drugs on ACE2 protein abundance. The findings of this study can serve as the first step in the development of appropriate and more comprehensive guidelines for the prescription of ACEi and ARB in the current and future coronavirus pandemics.","Sadria, Mehrshad; Layton, Anita T",PLoS Comput Biol,601,16

Machine learning algorithms represent a novel approach for the data-driven prediction of clinical outcomes with advantages over statistical modeling. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a machine learning-based score-the Piacenza score-for 30-day mortality prediction in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: The study comprised 852 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, admitted to the Guglielmo da Saliceto Hospital in Italy from February to November 2020. Patients' medical history, demographics, and clinical data were collected using an electronic health record. The overall patient data set was randomly split into derivation and test cohorts. The score was obtained through the naïve Bayes classifier and externally validated on 86 patients admitted to Centro Cardiologico Monzino (Italy) in February 2020. Using a forward-search algorithm, 6 features were identified: age, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, temperature, previous stroke, and gender. The Brier index was used to evaluate the ability of the machine learning model to stratify and predict the observed outcomes.

Regarding the customization properties of the Piacenza score, we added a tailored version of the algorithm to the website, which enables an optimized computation of the mortality risk score for a patient when some of the variables used by the Piacenza score are not available. In this case, the naïve Bayes classifier is retrained over the same derivation cohort but using a different set of patient characteristics. We also compared the Piacenza score with the 4C score and with a naïve Bayes algorithm with 14 features chosen a priori. RESULTS: The Piacenza score exhibited an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.84, Brier score=0.19) in the internal validation cohort and 0.79 (95% CI 0.68-0.89, Brier score=0.16) in the external validation cohort, showing a comparable accuracy with respect to the 4C score and to the naïve Bayes model with a priori chosen features; this achieved an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.83, Brier score=0.26) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.75-0.86, Brier score=0.17), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that a customizable machine learning-based score with a purely data-driven selection of features is feasible and effective for the prediction of mortality among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Halasz, Geza; Sperti, Michela; Villani, Matteo; Michelucci, Umberto; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe; Biagi, Andrea; Rossi, Luca; Botti, Andrea; Mari, Chiara; Maccarini, Marco; Pura, Filippo; Roveda, Loris; Nardecchia, Alessia; Mottola, Emanuele; Nolli, Massimo; Salvioni, Elisabetta; Mapelli, Massimo; Deriu, Marco Agostino; Piga, Dario; Piepoli, Massimo",J Med Internet Res,601,29

An underlying mechanism could be the improved ability of the variants to bind receptors on target cells and infect them. In this study, we provide atomic-level insight into the binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its single (N501Y), double (E484Q, L452R) and triple (N501Y, E484Q, L452R) mutated variants to the human ACE2 receptor. Using extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and advanced free energy calculations, we estimate the associated binding affinities and binding hotspots. We observe significant secondary structural changes in the RBD of the mutants, which lead to different binding affinities. We find higher binding affinities of the double (E484Q, L452R) and triple (N501Y, E484Q, L452R) mutated variants than the wild type and the N501Y variant, which could contribute to the higher transmissibility of recent variants containing these mutations.","Aggarwal, Abhishek; Naskar, Supriyo; Maroli, Nikhil; Gorai, Biswajit; Dixit, Narendra M; Maiti, Prabal K.",,601,1

Examining a recent consumer survey suggests consumers, especially among the younger generations, have mixed feelings about how the Canadian dairy industry is good for the environment or whether animals in the sector are humanely treated. The general Canadian public strongly supports financial stability for farmers, though is not fully educated about how supply management works. Issues regarding the centralization and amalgamation of the industry, making many regions underserved;recent milk dumping due to a strong shift in demand caused by COVID-19;and the popularity of dairy alternatives, show that the dairy sector in Canada is ill-prepared for major change. Dairy farmers are receiving compensation for trade deals recently ratified by the federal government, creating a precedent that will lead to an overcapitalized industry.

Approach and Results: Medical records of 616 pneumonia patients who were admitted to the Yichang Central People's Hospital in Hubei, China, from January 1 to March 23, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were treated in the dedicated COVID-19 units, and the patients with CAP were admitted to regular hospital campus. Risks of VTE were assessed using the Padua prediction score. All the patients received pharmaceutical or mechanical VTE prophylaxis. VTE was diagnosed using Duplex ultrasound or computed tomography pulmonary angiogram. Differences between COVID-19 and CAP groups were compared statistically. All statistical tests were 2 sided, and P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data managements and analyses were performed by IBM SPSS, version 24, software (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). Of the 616 patients, 256 had COVID-19 pneumonia and 360 patients had CAP. The overall rate of VTE was 2% in COVID-19 pneumonia group and 3.6% in CAP group, respectively (P=0.229). In these two groups, 15.6% of the COVID-19 pneumonia patients and 10% of the CAP patients were categorized as high risk for VTE (Padua score, >4), which were significantly different (P=0.036). In those high-risk patients, the incidence of VTE was 12.5% in COVID-19 pneumonia group and 16.7% in CAP group (P=0.606). Subgroup analysis of the critically ill patients showed that VTE rate was 6.7% in COVID-19 group versus 13% in CAP group (P=0.484). In-hospital mortality of COVID-19 and CAP was 6.3% and 3.9%, respectively (P=0.180). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with hypercoagulable state. However, the rate of VTE in COVID-19 pneumonia patients was not significantly higher than that in CAP patients.","Mei, Fei; Fan, Jiawei; Yuan, Jinhua; Liang, Zhenzhen; Wang, Kewei; Sun, Jianfeng; Guan, Wenfei; Huang, Mingkui; Li, Yu; Zhang, Wayne W",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,601,1

The resultant increase in prescribing was accompanied by an increase in adverse events, including severe toxicity and death. The Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning (EXTRIP) workgroup sought to determine the effect of and indications for extracorporeal treatments in cases of poisoning with these drugs. METHODS: We conducted systematic reviews of the literature, screened studies, extracted data, and summarized findings following published EXTRIP methods. RESULTS: A total of 44 studies (three in vitro studies, two animal studies, 28 patient reports or patient series, and 11 pharmacokinetic studies) met inclusion criteria regarding the effect of extracorporeal treatments. Toxicokinetic or pharmacokinetic analysis was available for 61 patients (13 chloroquine, three hydroxychloroquine, and 45 quinine). Clinical data were available for analysis from 38 patients, including 12 with chloroquine toxicity, one with hydroxychloroquine toxicity, and 25 with quinine toxicity. All three drugs were classified as non-dialyzable (not amenable to clinically significant removal by extracorporeal treatments). The available data do not support using extracorporeal treatments in addition to standard care for patients severely poisoned with either chloroquine or quinine (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Although hydroxychloroquine was assessed as being non-dialyzable, the clinical evidence was not sufficient to support a formal recommendation regarding the use of extracorporeal treatments for this drug. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our systematic review and analysis, the EXTRIP workgroup recommends against using extracorporeal methods to enhance elimination of these drugs in patients with severe chloroquine or quinine poisoning.","Berling, Ingrid; King, Joshua D; Shepherd, Greene; Hoffman, Robert S; Alhatali, Badria; Lavergne, Valery; Roberts, Darren M; Gosselin, Sophie; Wilson, Gabrielle; Nolin, Thomas D; Ghannoum, Marc",J Am Soc Nephrol,601,1

In this study, we aimed to identify the transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and assess the impact of COVID-19 case finding and contact tracing in each epidemic wave. METHODS: We collected data on COVID-19 cases published by local public health authorities in South Korea and divided the study into two epidemic periods (19 January-19 April 2020 for the first epidemic wave and 20 April-11 August 2020 for the second epidemic wave). To identify changes in the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the daily effective reproductive number (Rt) was estimated using the illness onset of the cases. Furthermore, to identify the characteristics of each epidemic wave, frequencies of cluster types were measured, and age-specific transmission probability matrices and serial intervals were estimated. The proportion of asymptomatic cases and cases with unknown sources of infection were also estimated to assess the changes of infections identified as cases in each wave. RESULTS: In early May 2020, within 2-weeks of a relaxation in strict social distancing measures, Rt increased rapidly from 0.2 to 1.8 within a week and was around 1 until early July 2020. In both epidemic waves, the most frequent cluster types were religious-related activities and transmissions among the same age were more common. Furthermore, children were rarely infectors or infectees, and the mean serial intervals were similar (~ 3 days) in both waves. The proportion of asymptomatic cases at presentation increased from 22% (in the first wave) to 27% (in the second wave), while the cases with unknown sources of infection were similar in both waves (22 and 24%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that relaxing social distancing measures was associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission despite rigorous case findings in South Korea. Along with social distancing measures, the enhanced contact tracing including asymptomatic cases could be an efficient approach to control further epidemic waves.","Ryu, Sukhyun; Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Noh, Eunbi; Kim, Dasom; Lau, Eric H Y; Cowling, Benjamin J",BMC Infect Dis,601,30

This is due to various factors such as the presence of asymptomatic carrier stage, increased morbidity and mortality in surgical procedures in a COVID-19 patient, and possible transmission of disease to the health care workers (HCWs). A guideline was formulated in our institution, which is a tertiary care university teaching hospital to resume the surgical activities in full. Following its implementation, a questionnaire-based study was conducted to understand the perception of the HCWs about the guidelines. The questionnaire had four domains with questions related to the impact of the epidemic on the practices, composition of the guidelines, its implementation, and effects. There were 217 responders which included doctors and the supportive staff. Majority of the responders welcomed the introduction of the guidelines, and felt that it ensured patient's safety and helped streamline the services. Quarantine and preoperative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing were found to be appropriate measures by the respondents. In some areas, there was a difference in the responses from the doctors to that from the supportive group which assumed statistical significance.

Why do people fail to ``unlearn''? We study one explanation: beliefs are resistant to retractions (the revoking of earlier information). Our experimental design identifies unlearning -- i.e., updating from retractions -- and enables its comparison with learning from equivalent new information. Across different kinds of retractions -- for instance, those consistent or contradictory with the prior, or those occurring when prior beliefs are either extreme or moderate -- subjects do not fully unlearn from retractions and update less from them than from equivalent new information. This phenomenon is not explained by most of the well-studied violations of Bayesian updating, which yield differing predictions in our design.

In October 2019, a wider array of products, including edibles, was legalized, with entry into the legal market beginning in December. DATA AND METHODS: Three quarters (the first quarters of 2018 and 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2020) of the National Cannabis Survey were used to examine changes in cannabis use (overall use and daily or almost daily (DAD) use), consumption methods, products and sources. RESULTS: Cannabis use in the past three months was higher in late 2020 (20.0%) than in 2019 (17.5%) and 2018 (14.0%), and this was particularly the case among: females (for whom rates rose to equal male rates for the first time), adults aged 25 and older, and some provinces. Similarly, DAD use, at 7.9% also increased. Higher percentages of Canadians reported getting at least some of their cannabis from legal sources or growing it, and fewer were relying on friends and family or illegal sources in 2020. DISCUSSION: This study spans three years-from before legalization to about two years after. It provides a more complete picture of the law's impact on cannabis use and related behaviours, given the more established legal cannabis industry better equipped to compete with the black market on price, convenience and selection. Findings demonstrate that change is continuing, and, as before, some cautions and assurances remain. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cannabis use continues to be difficult to measure. Monitoring remains important, given the ever-changing provincial retail landscapes; the introduction of new products; and the pressure by the industry to remove or adjust potency limits, and allow widespread delivery, farm-gate sales and cannabis lounges.","Rotermann, Michelle",Health Rep,601,1

However, asthma and atopy do not appear to be overrepresented comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, and hypotheses attempt to explain this observation. As COVID-19 continues to spread globally, it is imperative to understand how disease outcomes may be influenced in this population to guide patient care. RECENT FINDINGS: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the principal host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMRSS2) is the main priming protease. Models have linked atopic endotypes to reductions in ACE2 and increases in TMRSS2 on respiratory epithelia. Epidemiologic and experimental findings imply alterations in ACE2 expression correlate with clinical COVID-19 disease, but limitations restrict the ability to draw direct conclusions. SUMMARY: There is reasonable evidence to assert atopic endotypes modulate COVID-19 susceptibility, but it remains premature to classify this association as protective or deleterious. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease and epidemiologic studies should focus on investigating COVID-19 outcomes by underlying endotype. Direct experimental and clinical evidence is needed to draw definitive conclusions on how the complex interplay of ACE2 and TMRSS2 affect viral entry.

The high technicalities of nasopharyngeal sampling and molecular assays, as well as scarce resources of reagents, limit our testing capabilities. Several strategies failed, to date, to fully alleviate this testing process (e.g. saliva sampling or antigen testing on nasopharyngeal samples). We assessed the clinical performances of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-antigen) ELISA detection in serum or plasma using the COVID-19 Quantigene R (AAZ, France) assay. METHODS: Performances were determined on 63 sera from 63 non-COVID patients and 227 serum samples (165 patients) from the French COVID and CoV-CONTACT cohorts with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 142 serum (114 patients) obtained within 14 days after symptoms' onset.

Sensitivity was 79.3% overall (180/227, 95% CI, 74.0 to 84.6) and 93.0% (132/142, 95% CI, 88.7 to 97.2) within 14 days after symptoms onset. 91 included patients had a sera and nasopharyngeal swabs collected in the same 24 hours. Among those with high nasopharyngeal viral loads, i.e. Ct value below 30 and 33, only 1/50 and 4/67 tested negative for N-antigenemia, respectively. Among those with a negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, 8/12 presented positive N-antigenemia;the lower respiratory tract was explored for 6 of these 8 patients, showing positive RT-PCR in 5 cases. CONCLUSION: This is the first evaluation of a commercially available serum N-antigen detection assay. It presents a robust specificity and sensitivity within the first 14 days after symptoms onset. This approach provides a valuable new option for COVID-19 diagnosis, only requiring a blood draw and easily scalable in all clinical laboratories.","Hingrat, Q.

However, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain have been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of GI symptoms, elevated liver enzymes and mortality of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies that included a cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were performed from 1 December 2019 to 15 December 2020. Data were collected by conducting a literature search using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We analysed pooled data on the prevalence of individual GI symptoms and elevated liver enzymes and performed subanalyses to investigate the relationship between GI symptoms/elevated liver enzymes, geographical location, mortality, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: The available data of 78 798 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 from 158 studies were included in our analysis. The most frequent manifestations were diarrhoea (16.5%, 95% CI 14.2% to 18.4%), nausea (9.7%, 95% CI 9.0% to 13.2%) and elevated liver enzymes (5.6%, 95% CI 4.2% to 9.1%). The overall mortality and GI mortality were 23.5% (95% CI 21.2% to 26.1%) and 3.5% (95% CI 3.1% to 6.2%), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed non-statistically significant associations between GI symptoms/elevated liver enzymes and ICU admissions (OR=1.01, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.83). The GI mortality was 0.9% (95% CI 0.5% to 2.2%) in China and 10.8% (95% CI 7.8% to 11.3%) in the USA. CONCLUSION: GI symptoms/elevated liver enzymes are common in patients with COVID-19. Our subanalyses showed that the presence of GI symptoms/elevated liver enzymes does not appear to affect mortality or ICU admission rate. Furthermore, the proportion of GI mortality among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 varied based on geographical location.","Shehab, Mohammad; Alrashed, Fatema; Shuaibi, Sameera; Alajmi, Dhuha; Barkun, Alan",,601,1

We measured COVID-19 mRNA vaccine induced IgG and IgA in serum serially, up to 145 days post vaccination in 4 subjects. Spike antigen-specific IgG levels rose exponentially and plateaued 21 days after the initial vaccine dose. After the second vaccine dose IgG levels increased further, reaching a maximum approximately 7-10 days later, and remained elevated (average of 58% peak levels) during the additional >100 day follow up period. COVID-19 mRNA vaccination elicited spike antigen-specific IgA with similar kinetics of induction and time to peak levels, but more rapid decline in serum levels following both the 1st and 2nd vaccine doses (<18% peak levels within 100 days of the 2nd shot). The data demonstrate COVID-19 mRNA vaccines effectively induce spike antigen specific IgG and IgA and highlight marked differences in their persistence in serum.","Wisnewski, Adam V; Campillo Luna, Julian; Redlich, Carrie A",PLoS One,601,10

Because pregnant persons were excluded from the initial phase 3 clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines, limited data are available on their efficacy and safety during pregnancy. After developmental and reproductive toxicology studies are completed, some companies are expected to conduct clinical trials in pregnant persons. Until then, pregnant persons and their obstetricians will need to use available data to weigh the benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccines. Issues to be considered when counseling pregnant persons include data from animal studies and inadvertently exposed pregnancies during vaccine clinical trials when available, potential risks to pregnancy of vaccine reactogenicity, timing of vaccination during pregnancy, evidence for safety of other vaccines during pregnancy, risk of COVID-19 complications due to pregnancy and the pregnant person's underlying conditions, and risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and potential for risk mitigation.

An acellular biologic scaffold seems to be a promising option for urinary bladder augmentation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of bladder acellular matrix (BAM) for reconstruction of clinically significant large urinary bladder wall defects in a long-term porcine model. Urinary bladders were harvested from 10 pig donors. Biological scaffolds were prepared by chemically removing all cellular components from urinary bladder tissue. A total of 10 female pigs underwent hemicystectomy and subsequent bladder reconstruction with BAM. The follow-up study was 6 months. Reconstructed bladders were subjected to radiological, macroscopic, histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular evaluations. Six out of ten animals survived the 6-month follow-up period. Four pigs died during observation due to mechanical failure of the scaffold, anastomotic dehiscence between the scaffold and native bladder tissue, or occluded catheter. Tissue engineered bladder function was normal without any signs of postvoid residual urine in the bladder or upper urinary tracts. Macroscopically, graft shrinkage was observed. Urothelium completely covered the luminal surface of the graft. Smooth muscle regeneration was observed mainly in the peripheral graft region and gradually decreased toward the center of the graft. Expression of urothelial, smooth muscle, blood vessel, and nerve markers were lower in the reconstructed bladder wall compared to the native bladder. BAM seems to be a promising biomaterial for reconstruction of large urinary bladder wall defects.

METHODS: Data on Covid-19 deaths across 3,108 contiguous U.S. counties from the Johns Hopkins University and social determinants of health (SDoH) data from the County Health Ranking and the Bureau of Labor Statistics were fitted to Bayesian semi-parametric spatiotemporal Negative Binomial models, and 95% credible intervals (CrI) of incidence rate ratios (IRR) were used to assess the associations. Exceedance probabilities were used for detecting clusters. RESULTS: As of October 31, 2020, the median mortality rate was 40.05 per 100, 000. The monthly urban mortality rates increased with unemployment (IRRadjusted:1.41, 95%CrI: 1.24, 1.60), percent Black population (IRRadjusted:1.05, 95%CrI: 1.04, 1.07), and residential segregation (IRRadjusted:1.03, 95%CrI: 1.02, 1.04).

Here, by reanalyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data, we delineated metabolic remodeling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to elucidate the metabolic mechanisms that may lead to the progression of severe COVID-19. After scoring the metabolism-related biological processes and signaling pathways, we found that mono-CD14+ cells expressed higher levels of glycolysis-related genes (PKM, LDHA and PKM) and PPP-related genes (PGD and TKT) in severe patients than in mild patients. These genes may contribute to the hyperinflammation in mono-CD14+ cells of patients with severe COVID-19. The mono-CD16+ cell population in COVID-19 patients showed reduced transcription levels of genes related to lysine degradation (NSD1, KMT2E, and SETD2) and elevated transcription levels of genes involved in OXPHOS (ATP6V1B2, ATP5A1, ATP5E, and ATP5B), which may inhibit M2-like polarization. Plasma cells also expressed higher levels of the OXPHOS gene ATP13A3 in COVID-19 patients, which was positively associated with antibody secretion and survival of PCs. Moreover, enhanced glycolysis or OXPHOS was positively associated with the differentiation of memory B cells into plasmablasts or plasma cells. This study comprehensively investigated the metabolic features of peripheral immune cells and revealed that metabolic changes exacerbated inflammation in monocytes and promoted antibody secretion and cell survival in PCs in COVID-19 patients, especially those with severe disease.","Qi, Furong; Zhang, Wenbo; Huang, Jialu; Fu, Lili; Zhao, Jinfang",Front Immunol,601,1

Participants included 656 primary caregivers (e.g., mothers, fathers, foster parents) of least one child age 1.5-8 years of which 555 (84.6%) responded to at least one parenting questionnaire. Parenting quality was assessed across stressful, negative, and positive parenting dimensions. Household risk was examined across pandemic- linked (e.g., caregiver depression, unmet childcare needs) and stable factors (i.e., annual income, mental illness history). Significant correlates were examined with regressions in Mplus. Thematic analysis identified caregiver challenges and unmet needs from open-ended questions. FINDINGS: Caregiver depression, higher child parity, unmet childcare needs, and relationship distress predicted lower-quality parenting. Caregiver depression was the most significant predictor across every parenting dimension, with analyses indicating medium effect sizes, ds = .39 - .73. Qualitative findings highlighted severe strains on parent capacities including managing psychological distress, limited social supports, and too much unstructured time.

Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were assessed. Differences in the presence of symptoms and the relationship of coexistence and domestic violence were evaluated from a gender perspective. RESULTS: Men showed significant lower mean (SD) in anxiety, depression, and acute stress levels than women [HARS, 14.1 (9.8) versus. 18.4 (10.2), F = 56.2, p < .001; BDI 3.4 (3.9) versus 4.5 (4.3), F = 16.6, p < .001, and ASDI 3.6 (2.9) versus 4.7 (3.1), F = 39.0, p < .001, respectively), as well as a weaker depressive syndrome (28.1% males versus 39.9% females, &#967;2 = 25.5, p < .001).

We investigated the prevalence of elevated troponins in these patients and its prognostic value for predicting mortality. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching electronic databases and preprint servers. We included studies of hospitalised covid-19 patients that reported the frequency of troponin elevations above the upper reference limit and/or the association between troponins and mortality. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models. RESULTS: Fifty-one studies were included. Elevated troponins were found in 20.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16.8-25.0 %) of patients who received troponin test on hospital admission. Elevated troponins on admission were associated with a higher risk of subsequent death (risk ratio 2.68, 95% CI 2.08-3.46) after adjusting for confounders in multivariable analysis. The pooled sensitivity of elevated admission troponins for predicting death was 0.60 (95% CI 0.54-0.65), and the specificity was 0.83 (0.77-0.88). The post-test probability of death was about 42% for patients with elevated admission troponins and was about 9% for those with non-elevated troponins on admission. There was significant heterogeneity in the analyses, and many included studies were at risk of bias due to the lack of systematic troponin measurement and inadequate follow-up. CONCLUSION: Elevated troponins were relatively common in patients hospitalised for covid-19. Troponin measurement on admission might help in risk stratification, especially in identifying patients at high risk of death when troponin levels are elevated.

A plan is presented for how the model can be implemented worldwide in healthcare and how novel treatments and targets can be detected. The idea is based on poikilosis, pervasive heterogeneity, and variation at all levels, systems, and mechanisms. Poikilosis in diseases can be taken into account in pathogenicity model, which is based on distribution of three independent condition measures—extent, modulation, and severity. Pathogenicity model is a population or cohort-based description of disease components. Evidence-based thresholds can be applied to the pathogenicity model and used for diagnosis as well as for early detection of patients in risk of developing the most severe forms of the disease. Analysis of patients with differential course of disease can help in detecting biomarkers of diagnostic and prognostic significance. A practical and feasible plan is presented how the concepts can be implemented in practice.

This article introduces readers to core concepts, as well as recent advances, in bedside and instrumented vestibular assessments. RECENT FINDINGS: Vestibular testing has improved immensely in the past 2 decades. While history and bedside testing is still the primary method of differential diagnosis in patients with dizziness, advances in technology such as the ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential test for superior canal dehiscence and the video head impulse test for vestibular neuritis have capabilities that go far beyond the bedside examination. Current vestibular testing now allows clinicians to test all five vestibular sensors in the inner ear. SUMMARY: Contemporary vestibular testing technology can now assess the entire vestibular periphery. Relatively subtle conditions, such as superior canal dehiscence or a subtle vestibular neuritis, can now be diagnosed with far greater certainty.","Hain, Timothy C; Cherchi, Marcello",Continuum (Minneap Minn),601,16

Drawing on Bleger's formulations on the construction of the analytic frame and on André Green's on the function of the framing structure in the construction and elaboration of phantasy life, the case study shows how, in the absence of the physicality of the setting, the most primitive anxieties about the symbiotic relationship with the mother were expressed and contained in the transference and countertransference in the analysis. The author offers some considerations about the notion of ""background of the uncanny"", derived from Yolanda Gampel, which draws attention to the challenges when both patient and analyst are inserted into the same traumatic wider context.

Neuropsychology services are no exception. Methods for neuropsychological assessments, which typically require an in-person visit, must be modified in order to adhere to social distancing and isolation standards enacted in an effort to slow the pandemic. How can providers continue to meet the needs of patients referred for neuropsychology evaluations, while respecting federal and state guidelines for safety and ethical mandates? We offer a novel, tiered model of care, successfully implemented in response to mandated social distancing, in a large, pediatric neuropsychology program. METHOD: We describe the considerations and challenges to be addressed in transitioning a large neuropsychology department to a new model of care, including triaging referrals, developing -or rediscovering - types of services to meet the needs of a virtual patient population, and helping patients, parents, and providers to adjust to these new models. CONCLUSIONS: Lessons learned as a function of rapid changes in care models have implications for the field of neuropsychology as a whole as well as for future flexibility in meeting the needs of pediatric patients and their families.","Pritchard, Alison E; Sweeney, Kristie; Salorio, Cynthia F; Jacobson, Lisa A",Clin Neuropsychol,601,16

DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Rehabilitation hospital. PARTICIPANTS: We assessed the general cognitive functioning through tablet-supported video calls in 9 of 12 consecutive patients (N=9) admitted to the hospital at least 30 days earlier for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19. Three patients were excluded based on the exclusion criteria. None of the patients presented cognitive symptoms before hospitalization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: General cognitive functioning, measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test. RESULTS: A general cognitive decay was observed in 3 patients (33.3%) who had a pathologic score on the MMSE, with a specific decline in attention, memory, language, and praxis abilities. The cognitive malfunctioning appears to be linearly associated with the length of stay (in d) in the intensive care unit (ICU). The longer the amount of time spent in the ICU, the lower the MMSE score, indicating a lower global cognitive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that some patients with COVID-19 might also benefit from neuropsychological rehabilitation, given their possible global cognitive decay. The link between neuropsychological functioning and the length of stay in the ICU suggests that neurocognitive rehabilitative treatments should be directed explicitly toward patients who treated in the ICU, rather than toward every patient who experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome owing to COVID-19. However, given the limitation of a case series study, those hypotheses should be tested with future studies with larger samples and a longer follow-up period.","Negrini, Francesco; Ferrario, Irene; Mazziotti, Daniele; Berchicci, Marzia; Bonazzi, Maurizio; de Sire, Alessandro; Negrini, Stefano; Zapparoli, Laura",Arch. phys. med. rehabil,601,16

However, social disruption and economic damage are becoming visible some 7 months after the Wuhan City outbreak early December 2019. The authors wondered what could have been done better in prevention and repression of the Covid-19 pandemic from a safety management and risk control point of view. Within a case study framework, the authors gathered literature on pandemics, about country response effectiveness, and about human behaviour in the face of danger. The results consist of a safety management oriented narrative about the current pandemic, several critical observations about the current paradigms and shortcomings of preparation, and a number of opportunities for improvements of countermeasures. Many of the proverbial animals in the safety zoo, representing typical behaviours, were observed in action. Based on well proven risk analysis methods – risk management, event tree, scenarios, bowtie – the authors then analyse the generic sequence of events in a pandemic, starting from root causes, through prevention, via the outbreak of a pathogen, through mitigation to long term effects. Based on this analysis the authors propose an integrated pandemics barrier model. In this model the core is a generic pandemic scenario that is distinguishing five risk controllable sequential steps before an outbreak. The authors contend that the prevention of pandemics via safety management based biohazard risk control is both possible and of paramount importance since it can stop pandemic scenarios altogether even before an outbreak.","Lindhout, Paul; Reniers, Genserik",Saf.

Methods: The clinical and CT imaging data of 60 cured patients with imported COVID-19 and discharged from January to February 2020 in Anhui Province were retrospectively collected. At the initial diagnosis, 5 cases were mild, 53 were ordinary, and 2 were severe. The clinical characteristics of the patients and the characteristics of chest CT images at discharge were analyzed. Results: Fever (57 cases) and cough (55 cases) were the main symptoms in 60 patients. In 5 mild patients, 3 cases were negative in the whole course of CT examination, 2 cases were negative in the first time and abnormal in the second time. The first CT imaging features of 55 patients (53 common type and 2 severe type) were mainly bilateral lung involvement (51 cases), multiple lesions (33 cases), more common under the pleura (40 cases), and ground glass opacities were the most common (55 cases). The features of chest CT in clinical outcomes were that the ground glass shadow in the lung gradually faded and was completely absorbed (19 cases); the scope of ground glass shadow in the lung expanded and progressed to crazy-paving, consolidation shadow, and the lesion gradually absorbed again followed by fibrous cord shadows (27 cases); ground-glass opacities in the lungs quickly progressed to a consolidation and then slowly absorbed. Most of the lesions were accompanied by more residual fibrous cord shadows (4 cases). In 2 severe patients, the lesions in the lungs were larger ground glass, and a large amount of fibrous foci remained after slow absorption. Conclusions: Chest CT plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of imported COVID-19, and the degree of lung involvement seen on CT images is in good agreement with clinical outcome.","Li, Xiaohu; Wang, Haitao; Zhu, Juan; Qiu, Xiaohui; Zhang, Jinping; Huang, Guoquan; Zeng, Xiaosong; He, Kewu; Xie, Zongyu; Xu, Qizhong; Liu, Bin; Yu, Yongqiang",Chin.

As of now, no registered therapies are available for treatment of coronavirus infection. The viral infection depends on the attachment of spike (S) glycoprotein to human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We have designed a protein inhibitor (&#916;ABP-D25Y) targeting S protein using computational approach. The inhibitor consists of two &#945; helical peptides homologues to protease domain (PD) of ACE2. Docking studies and molecular dynamic simulation revealed that the inhibitor binds exclusively at the ACE2 binding site of S protein. The computed binding affinity of the inhibitor is higher than the ACE2 and thus will likely out compete ACE2 for binding to S protein. Hence, the proposed inhibitor &#916;ABP-D25Y could be a potential blocker of S protein and receptor binding domain (RBD) attachment.","Jaiswal, Grijesh; Kumar, Veerendra",PLoS One,601,16

In this study, we comprehensively analyzed viral load, antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, and cytokines/chemokines during the disease course, and identified the factors related to severity. Nasopharyngeal (NP) and plasma specimens were obtained from 31 patients with COVID-19 during hospitalization. Viral RNA in NP specimens was quantified by reverse transcription-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and cytokines/chemokines in plasma specimens were analyzed by ELISA and cytometric bead array. The viral load in patients with COVID-19 peaked at the early stage of the disease and continuously decreased. Severe and critical cases showed higher viral load and prolonged viral shedding than asymptomatic and mild cases. Whereas plasma IgG was gradually increased and maintained during hospitalization, plasma IgM peaked at 3 weeks after symptom onset and dissipated. The antibody response in severe and critical cases was slightly delayed but stronger than those in others. High levels of interferon (IFN)-&#945;, IFN-Î³-induced protein-10, monokine induced by IFN-Î³, and interleukin-6 at 5-10 days from symptom onset were associated with the severity of COVID-19.

There is little data on the use of on-demand telehealth to meet this need.Methods: The functional performance of on-demand telehealth as a COVID-19 remote patient screening approach was conducted by analysing 9270 patient requests.Results: Most on-demand telehealth requests (5712 of 9270 total requests; 61.6%) had a visit reason that was likely COVID-19 related. Of these, 79.1% (4518 of 5712) resulted in a completed encounter and 20.9% (1194 of 5712) resulted in left without being seen. Of the 4518 completed encounters, 19.1% were referred to an urgent care centre, emergency department or COVID-19 testing centre.

Of non-pharmaceutical interventions, social distancing policies -- designed to reduce person-to-person pathogenic spread -- have risen to recent prominence. In particular, stay-at-home policies of the sort widely implemented around the globe in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have proven to be markedly effective at slowing pandemic growth. However, such blunt policy instruments, while effective, produce numerous unintended consequences, including potentially dramatic reductions in economic productivity. Here we develop methods to investigate the potential to simultaneously contain pandemic spread while also minimizing economic disruptions. We do so by incorporating both occupational and network information contained within an urban environment, information that is commonly excluded from typical pandemic control policy design. The results of our method suggest that large gains in both economic productivity and pandemic control might be had by the incorporation and consideration of simple-to-measure characteristics of the occupational contact network. However we find evidence that more sophisticated, and more privacy invasive, measures of this network do not drastically increase performance.","Avraam, Demetris; Obradovich, Nick; Pescetelli, Niccol'o; Cebrian, Manuel; Rutherford, Alex",,601,10

In developing nations such as Jordan, appreciable impacts on healthcare delivery ensued owing to limited resources. As a result, managing chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) has been modified to accommodate altercations in the system. This study assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on managing patients with critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) during the lockdown. METHODS: Objectives were accomplished by retrieving records of clinical data and perioperative results for patients diagnosed with CLTI at King Abdullah University Hospital between March 17 and June 1, 2020. Patients' demographics, Rutherford classification, type of intervention, and intervention variables during the outbreak were retrospectively analyzed (pandemic Group A) and compared with patients from the same period last year (control Group B). RESULTS: A total of 96 patients with CLTI were included in the study; Groups A and B consisted of 28 and 68 patients, respectively. The mean ages for Groups A and B were 62.8 and 60.2 years, respectively. Conservative management was applied to 53.6% (P < 0.01) of Group A patients, whereas endovascular revascularization was the primary approach in Group B (39.7%, P < 0.01). After the intervention, the majority of patients in Group A were classified as category six on the Rutherford classification system (46.4%, P < 0.01), whereas the majority in group B were classified as category five (55.9%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The more unsatisfactory outcome of CLTI during the pandemic entails substantial measures to ensure conscientious virtual encounters and ambulatory community-based services during current and future pandemics. The endovascular-first policy should be endorsed in future pandemics as it is better at reducing aerosol transmission than standard surgical intervention. Moreover, endovascular procedures are minimally invasive and associated with favorable outcomes when medical optimization and hospital beds are limited.","Aljarrah, Qusai; Allouh, Mohammed; Hallak, Amer; Al-Omari, Mamoon; Mesmar, Zaid; Kamel, Ahmad; Husein, Anas; Manasreh, Tarek; Bakkar, Sohail; Jarboa, Hamza",Int J Surg Case Rep,601,15

METHODS: All patients, who were referred to a tertiary-university hospital respiratory triage (March 27-April 26, 2020), were highly clinically suggestive for COVID-19 and had undergone a chest CT scan were included. Those with positive rRT-PCR or highly clinically suspicious patients with typical chest CT scan pulmonary manifestations were considered confirmed COVID-19 for additional analyses. Patients, based on outcome, were categorized into outpatient, ordinary-ward admitted, intensive care unit (ICU) admitted, and deceased; their demographic, clinical, and chest CT scan parameters were compared. The pulmonary chest CT scan features were scaled with a novel semi-quantitative scoring system to assess pulmonary involvement (PI). RESULTS: Chest CT scans of 739 patients (mean age = 49.2 ± 17.2 years old, 56.7% male) were reviewed; 491 (66.4%), 176 (23.8%), and 72 (9.7%) cases were managed outpatient, in an ordinary ward, and ICU, respectively. A total of 439 (59.6%) patients were confirmed COVID-19 cases; their most prevalent chest CT scan features were ground-glass opacity (GGO) (93.3%), pleural-based peripheral distribution (60.3%), and multi-lobar (79.7%), bilateral (76.6%), and lower lobes (RLL and/or LLL) (89.1%) involvement. Patients with lower SpO2, advanced age, RR, total PI score or PI density score, and diffuse distribution or involvement of multi-lobar, bilateral, or lower lobes were more likely to be ICU admitted/expired. After adjusting for confounders, predictive models found cutoffs of age &#8805; 53, SpO2 &#8804; 91, and PI score &#8805; 8 (15) for ICU admission (death). A combination of all three factors showed 89.1% and 95% specificity and 81.9% and 91.4% accuracy for ICU admission and death outcomes, respectively. Solely evaluated high PI score had high sensitivity, specificity, and NPV in predicting the outcome as well. CONCLUSION: We strongly recommend patients with age &#8805; 53, SpO2 &#8804; 91, and PI score &#8805; 8 or even only high PI score to be considered as high-risk patients for further managements and care plans. KEY POINTS: â¢ Chest CT scan is a valuable tool in prioritizing the patients in hospital triage. â¢ A more accurate and novel 35-scale semi-quantitative scoring system was designed to predict the COVID-19 patients' outcome. â¢ Patients with age &#8805; 53, SpO2 &#8804; 91, and PI score &#8805; 8 or even only high PI score should be considered high-risk patients.","Salahshour, Faeze; Mehrabinejad, Mohammad-Mehdi; Nassiri Toosi, Mohssen; Gity, Masoumeh; Ghanaati, Hossein; Shakiba, Madjid; Nosrat Sheybani, Sina; Komaki, Hamidreza; Kolahi, Shahriar",Eur. radiol,601,5

Despite recent research that suggests COVID-19 and lockdown measures may eventually impact sexual response and sexually related behaviors, we are missing clinical sexologists' perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 in sexual health. Such perspectives could inform a preliminary framework aimed at guiding future research and clinical approaches in the context of COVID-19. AIM: To explore the perspectives of clinical sexologists about the impact of COVID-19 on their patients' sexual health, as well as the professional challenges they have faced during the current pandemic. Findings are expected to inform a preliminary framework aimed at understanding the impact of COVID-19 on sexual health. METHODS: We conducted an online qualitative exploratory survey with 4 open-ended questions with 39 clinical sexologists aged between 32 and 73 years old. The survey was advertised among professional associations' newsletters. We performed a Thematic Analysis using an inductive, semantic, and (critical) realist approach, leading to a final thematic map. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome is the thematic map and the corresponding table that aggregates the main themes, subthemes, and codes derived from participants' answers and that can serve as a preliminary framework to understand the impact of COVID-19 on sexual health. RESULTS: The final thematic map, expected to serve as a preliminary framework on the impact of COVID-19 in sexual health, revealed 3 main themes: Clinical Focus, Remapping Relationships, and Reframing Technology Use. These themes aggregate important interrelated issues, such as worsening of sexual problems and dysfunctions, mental health, relationship management, the rise of conservatism, and the use of new technology that influences sexuality and sexual health-related services. CONCLUSION: The current study allowed us to develop a preliminary framework to understand the impact of COVID-19 on sexual health. This framework highlights the role of mental health, as well as the contextual nature of sexual problems, and subsequently, their relational nature. Also, it demonstrates that the current pandemic has brought into light the debate of e-Health delivery within clinical sexology. PM Pascoal, J Carvalho, CF Raposo, et al.

The aim of this manuscript is to describe and share our experience in the prevention and treatment of the personal protective equipment related pressure sores and other skin alterations in the medical and paramedical staff. Materials and methods All healthcare workers with PPE-related skin damages were registered at time 0. Age, sex, profession, type of skin damage, diseases and possible drugs were registered. Results Two strategies were emplyed: the first strategy was to immediately treat the skin and the second one was to prevent pressure wounds formation both in already affected healthcare workers and the recurrence in healed staff. Three weeks after the two strategies were used, the incidence rate PPE-related skin damage was reduced in a statistically significant way. Conclusions Proper management helps in reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers related to personal protective devices in CoVid-19 Units.

These ligands were designed to provide a pH-dependent relaxivity response upon complexation with Mn2+ in aqueous solution. The protonation constants of the ligands and the stability constants of the Mn2+ complexes were determined using potentiometric titrations complemented by spectrophotometric experiments. The deprotonations of the sulfonamide groups of the ligands are characterized by protonation constants of log KiH = 10.36 and 10.59 for DPASAm3- and HNO2ASAm2-, respectively. These values decrease dramatically to log KiH = 6.43 and 5.42 in the presence of Mn2+, because of the coordination of the negatively charged sulfonamide groups to the metal ion. The higher log KiH value in [Mn(DPASAm)]- is related to the formation of a seven-coordinate complex, while the metal ion in [Mn(NO2ASAm)]- is six-coordinated. The X-ray crystal structure of Na[Mn(DPASAm)(H2O)]·2H2O confirms the formation of a seven-coordinate complex, where the coordination environment is fulfilled by the donor atoms of the two picolinate groups, the amine N atom, the N atom of the sulfonamide group, and a coordinated water molecule. The lower conditional stability of the [Mn(NO2ASAm)]- complex and the lower protonation constant of the sulfonamide group results in complex dissociation at relatively high pH (<7.0). However, protonation of the sulfonamide group in [Mn(DPASAm)]- falls into the physiologically relevant pH window and causes a significant increase in relaxivity from r1p = 3.8 mM-1 s-1 at pH 9.0 to r1p = 8.9 mM-1 s-1 at pH 4.0 (10 MHz, 25 °C).","Uzal-Varela, Rocío; Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Aurora; Martínez-Calvo, Miguel; Carniato, Fabio; Lalli, Daniela; Esteban-Gómez, David; Brandariz, Isabel; Pérez-Lourido, Paulo; Botta, Mauro; Platas-Iglesias, Carlos",Inorg. chem,601,1

Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19 as SARS-CoV-2 is able to enter gastrointestinal epithelial cells. However, these complaints can also be caused by a COVID-19-independent concomitant abdominal pathology. Therefore, patients with acute abdominal pain and fever need to be assessed very thoroughly.

The secondary aims were to assess whether there were clinical factors associated with COVID-19 status, the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19, and the rate of potential COVID-19 in patients not presenting to healthcare services. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective study was conducted of patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (1 March 2020 to 31 March 2020) with a minimum of 60 days follow-up. Patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, procedure type, primary or revision, length of stay (LOS), COVID-19 test status, and postoperative mortality were recorded. A subgroup of patients (n = 211) who had not presented to healthcare services after discharge were contacted and questioned as to whether they had symptoms of COVID-19. RESULTS: Five (0.5%) of 1,073 patients who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 postoperatively. When adjusting for confounding factors, increasing LOS (p = 0.022) was the only significant factor associated with developing COVID-19 following surgery and a stay greater than three days was a reliable predictor with an area under the curve of 81% (p = 0.018). There were three (0.3%) deaths in the study cohort and the overall mortality rate attributable to COVID-19 was 0.09% (n = 1/1,073), with one (20%) of the five patients with COVID-19 dying postoperatively. Of the 211 patients contacted, two had symptoms within two to 14 days postoperatively with a positive predictive value of 31% and it was therefore estimated that one patient may have had undiagnosed COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The rate of postoperative COVID-19 was 0.5% and may have been as high as 1% when accounting for those patients not presenting to healthcare services, which was similar to the estimated population prevalence during the study period. The overall mortality rate secondary to COVID-19 was low (0.09%), however the mortality rate for those patients developing COVID-19 was 20%.

However, previous portrait matting methods were all based on identifiable portrait images. To fill the gap, we present P3M-10k in this paper, which is the first large-scale anonymized benchmark for Privacy-Preserving Portrait Matting. P3M-10k consists of 10,000 high-resolution face-blurred portrait images along with high-quality alpha mattes. We systematically evaluate both trimap-free and trimap-based matting methods on P3M-10k and find that existing matting methods show different generalization capabilities when following the Privacy-Preserving Training (PPT) setting, i.e., training on face-blurred images and testing on arbitrary images. To devise a better trimap-free portrait matting model, we propose P3M-Net, which leverages the power of a unified framework for both semantic perception and detail matting, and specifically emphasizes the interaction between them and the encoder to facilitate the matting process. Extensive experiments on P3M-10k demonstrate that P3M-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both objective metrics and subjective visual quality. Besides, it shows good generalization capacity under the PPT setting, confirming the value of P3M-10k for facilitating future research and enabling potential real-world applications.

METHODS: We performed a case series of all PWH sequentially admitted with COVID-19 from 8 March 2020 to 23 April 2020 at three hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia. Sociodemographic, clinical and HIV-associated characteristics were collected. RESULTS: Of 530 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized during this period, 20 occurred among PWH (3.8%). The median age was 57 (Q1-Q3, 48-62) years, 65% were men, and 85% were non-Hispanic Black. Presenting median symptom duration was 5 (Q1-Q3, 3-7) days; cough (90%), fever (65%), malaise (60%) and dyspnea (60%) were most common. On admission, 40% of patients required oxygenation support and 65% had an abnormal chest radiograph. Median length of hospitalization was 5 (Q1-Q3, 4-12) days, 30% required intensive care, 15% required intubation, and 15% died. Median CD4 cell count prior to admission was 425 (Q1-Q3, 262-815) cells/µl and 90% of patients had HIV-1 RNA less than 200 copies/ml. Half of the patients had at least five comorbidities; hypertension (70%), dyslipidemia (60%) and diabetes (45%) were most prevalent. All three patients who died had CD4 cell count more than 200, HIV suppression and each had a total of five comorbidities. CONCLUSION: The multisite series in the Southern United States provides characteristics and early outcomes of hospitalized PWH with COVID-19. Nearly all patients had controlled HIV and a high comorbidity burden.

METHODS: The study was a multicentric open-label trial of COVID-19 patients who were aged &#8805;â¯18 years, receiving oxygen without mechanical ventilation, and with evidence of systemic inflammatory response who were assigned to standard of care (SOC) or SOC plus intravenous MP (40â¯mg bid for 3 days followed by 20â¯mg bid for 3 days). The primary outcome was a composite of death, admission to the intensive care unit, or requirement for noninvasive ventilation. Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 91 patients were screened, and 64 were randomized (mean age70â¯± 12 years). In the ITT analysis, 14 of 29 patients (48%) in the SOC group and 14 of 35 (40%) in the MP group suffered the composite endpoint (40% versus 20% in patients under 72 years and 67% versus 48% in those over 72 years; pâ¯= 0.25).

There is no term as Epidemiology in Ayurveda, but the principles were described in piecemeal when com-piled, analysed and interpreted the same as a modern theory of Epidemiol-ogy. Many of today’s medical sciences coincide with some of the basic principles of Ayurveda. Today whole world is suffering from the COVID-19 pan-demic. To assess the concepts of epidemiology in Ayurveda and to com-pare the same with recent COVID-19 pandemic. Literary study of the epidemic was done thoroughly, including classical treatises like Charak Samhita, Sushrut Samhita & modern textbooks of epidemiology. Most of the concepts of Ayurveda about Janapadodhwamsa are found relevant to current theories of pandemic/epidemic. When COVID-19 pandemic compares with Janapadod-hwamsa, it shows similarity in concepts like aetiology, modes of transmis-sion, principles of prevention of outbreaks etc. Also, control measures of COVID-19 can be compared with Hetu-viparit&Vyadhi-viparitchikitsa. The concepts described in Ayurveda regarding Janapadodhwamsa are more or like the present modern concept of the pandemic/epidemic. Thus, the ancient Indian medicinal systems were well known to the fact of the epidemics & outbreaks of infectious diseases.","Thakare, Seema Himmatrao; Jumade, Prashil Prakashrao",Int. J. Res. Pharm.

The identification of targeted antiviral mouth rinses to reduce salivary viral load would contribute to reducing the COVID-19 pandemic. While awaiting the results of significant clinical studies, which to date do not exist, the commercial availability of mouth rinses leads us to search among them for reagents that would have specific antiviral properties with respect to SARS-CoV-2. The challenges facing this target were examined for 7 reagents found in commercially available mouth rinses and listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website: povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide, cyclodextrin, Citrox, cetylpyridinium chloride, and essential oils. Because SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, many reagents target the outer lipid membrane. Moreover, some of them can act on the capsid by denaturing proteins. Until now, there has been no scientific evidence to recommend mouth rinses with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect to control the viral load in the oral cavity. This critical review indicates that current knowledge of these reagents would likely improve trends in salivary viral load status. This finding is a strong sign to encourage clinical research for which quality protocols are already available in the literature.","Carrouel, F; Gonçalves, L S; Conte, M P; Campus, G; Fisher, J; Fraticelli, L; Gadea-Deschamps, E; Ottolenghi, L; Bourgeois, D",J Dent Res,601,29

Here, we determined whether SGLT2 inhibition affects megalin endocytic function through suppressing its O-linked ß-N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation) and protects the diabetic kidney from protein overload. MATERIALS AND METHOD: We treated 8-week-old male non-obese and hypoinsulinemic KK/Ta-Ins2Akita (KK/Ta-Akita) mice which develop progressive DN with an SGLT2 inhibitor ipragliflozin or insulin for 6â¯weeks, and investigated the endocytic function (proximal tubular protein reabsorption), renal expression and O-GlcNAcylation of megalin along with their effects on renal phenotypes including histology and biochemical markers. RESULTS: The treatment with ipragliflozin, but not insulin, suppressed megalin O-GlcNAcylation and accelerated its internalization, resulting in reduction in proximal tubular reabsorption of the highly filtered plasma proteins such as albumin and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. These alterations following the ipragliflozin treatment contributed to amelioration of proximal tubular protein overload, mitochondrial morphological abnormality, and renal oxidative stress and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides a novel crosstalk mechanism between SGLT2 inhibition and megalin underlying the potential renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in DN.","Otomo, Hitomi; Nara, Mitsuhiko; Kato, Shunsuke; Shimizu, Tatsunori; Suganuma, Yumi; Sato, Takehiro; Morii, Tsukasa; Yamada, Yuichiro; Fujita, Hiroki",Metabolism,601,20

METHODS: A survey was sent to MFM fellowship program directors for distribution to current MFM fellows across U.S. Geographic regions, as determined using Census Bureau-designated regions. The survey looked at comfort and experience with FAVDs and vacuum-assisted vaginal deliveries (VAVD) throughout their post-graduate training. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze survey responses. Respondents were compared by post-graduate year (PGY) and region. RESULTS: One hundred six MFM fellows (32%) completed the survey. 22.6% of MFM fellows had performed greater than 30 FAVDs, with 33% having performed &#8804;10 FAVDs. In comparison, 35.8% of fellows had performed more than 30 VAVDs. While 95.2% of fellows feel prepared to perform a VAVD independently, only 59.4% feel prepared to do FAVDs independently. Never the less, 53% of MFM fellows favor performing a FAVD. While some regional differences were seen, there was no significant difference in the percent of fellows by geographic region who have performed >30 FAVD (p = .87). MFM fellows in the West are most likely to have performed >30 FAVD at 57.8%, compared to 42.3, 35, and 11.4% in the Midwest, South, and Northeast, respectively. CONCLUSION: MFM fellows are more confident with VAVD compared to FAVD. Despite feeling less confident performing FAVD (versus VAVD), the majority of MFM fellows feel comfortable performing FAVDs independently. Region of training fellowship training does not significantly affect one's confidence in FAVDs. A coordinated nationwide effort to increase exposure to and confidence for FAVDs should be considered.","Rose, Kelsey; Mei, Jenny; Kwan, Lorna; Pluym, Ilina D; Han, Christina S; Afshar, Yalda",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,601,20

In order to investigate the prevalence and evolution of CaKoV in Tangshan, China, 82 dog fecal samples from pet hospitals in Tangshan were subjected to RT-PCR targeting a segment of the 3D gene of CaKoV. Using this method, we identified CaKoV in 14 samples (17.07%, 14/82).

A dose-response relationship has been demonstrated, whereby increasing sedentary time corresponds with increasing mortality rate. This study aimed to identify current levels of sedentary behaviour among General Practitioners (GPs), by examining and synthesising how sedentary behaviour has been measured in the primary care literature. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify studies relating to levels of sedentary behaviour among GPs. Searches were performed using Medline®, Embase®, PscycINFO, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, from inception of databases until January 2020, with a subsequent search of grey literature. Articles were assessed for quality and bias, with extraction of relevant data. RESULTS: The search criteria returned 1707 studies. Thirty four full texts were reviewed and 2 studies included in the final review. Both were cross-sectional surveys using self-reported estimation of sedentary time within the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Keohane et al. examined GP trainees and GP trainers in Ireland. 60% reported spending in excess of 7 h sitting each day, 24% between 4 and 7 h, and 16% less than or equal to 4 h. Suija et al. examined female GPs in Estonia. The mean reported daily sitting time was 6 h and 36 min, with 56% sitting for over 6 h per day. Both studies were of satisfactory methodological quality but had a high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of research examining current levels of sedentary behaviour among GPs. Objective data is needed to determine GPs' current levels of sedentary behaviour, particularly in light of the increase in remote consulting as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mayne, Richard S; Hart, Nigel D; Heron, Neil",BMC Fam Pract,601,21

However, little is known about how well these unprecedented measures are being observed as the pandemic evolves. We conducted a six-month online survey to assess the preventive behaviour of Cameroonian adults during the COVID-19 outbreak. A five-point adherence score was constructed based on self-reported observance of the following preventive measures: physical distancing, face mask use, hand hygiene, not touching one's face, and covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing. Predictors of adherence were investigated using ordinal logistic regression models. Of the 7381 responses received from all ten regions, 73.3% were from male respondents and overall mean age was 32.8 ± 10.8 years. Overall mean adherence score was 3.96 ± 1.11 on a scale of 0-5.

By reviewing the existing pathological studies of COVID-19, it was found that abundant mucus secretion, formation of a hyaline membrane (supportive of acute respiratory distress syndrome), and interstitial fibrous exudation may be important characteristics of COVID-19 and may be pathological targets of drug therapy. In addition, multiple extrapulmonary organ injuries in COVID-19 may be associated with cytokine storm. NAC is an important antioxidant and anti-inflammatory drug. NAC has been demonstrated to have mucolytic effects in bronchitis, relieve respiratory failure in acute respiratory distress syndrome, and inhibit fibrous exudation in interstitial lung disease in clinical studies. These findings suggest that NAC may have a therapeutic effect on the pathological targets of COVID-19. Furthermore, NAC decreases TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-17 serum levels in patients with sepsis, severe burns, acute liver failure, or peritoneal dialysis and may also reduce cytokine storm in COVID-19. The antiviral effect of NAC on other respiratory viruses may also benefit COVID-19 patients. Summarizing the potential mechanisms of NAC in treating COVID-19 suggests that the role of NAC in COVID-19 treatment is worthy of further research.","Zhou, Nan; Yang, Xiaofan; Huang, Aie; Chen, Zhenbing",Curr pharm. biotechnol,601,1

Questionnaire survey methods have informed on how appropriation of digital devices influenced learner agency, specifically for girls belonging to low family income bracket. Our study showcases many aspects of digital gender divide issues spanning digital access, digital capability and digital outcomes. Learning is a function of the environment and cultural settings in which learners are situated. Our study reveals that girls in particular are much constrained in their learning space. Learning via online platforms from their homes (informal spaces) compared to direct teaching at schools (formal spaces) has created inequitable learning opportunities. This has further impacted learners' agency, that is, in how girls are able to achieve their learning outcomes.

In this unprecedented crisis, educators, managers and families had to deal with unpredictability and look for new ways of learning and teaching. Based on the paradigm of transmission of mass distribution, remotely teaching has gained strength, with the teacher as the protagonist of the education process. Instead of interactivity, content is emphasized to the detriment of more participatory, dialogic, and collaborative methodologies. It is necessary to prepare teachers and students for the online education modality to face this critical moment.

In our effort we have explored the 2-alkynyl substituted 3-chloropyrazine framework as a potential template for the design of molecules for this purpose. Our strategy was supported by the in silico studies of representative compounds to assess their binding affinities via docking into the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NTD) of N-protein of SARS-CoV-2. Thus we created a small library of molecules based on the aforementioned template via an environmentally safer method that involved the rapid synthesis of 2-alkynyl 3-chloropyrazine derivatives under Cu-catalysis assisted by ultrasound. The reactions proceeded via the coupling of 2,3-dichloropyrazine with commercially available terminal alkynes in the presence of CuI, PPh3 and K2CO3 in PEG-400.

Our objective was to describe adherence to cysteamine in NC patients, using electronic monitoring systems. METHODS: Patients with confirmed NC, aged > 4 years and receiving oral cysteamine (short acting or delayed release formulation as standard of care) from 3 French reference centers, were included. Adherence to treatment was primarily assessed as the percentage of days with a good adherence score, adherence score rating from 0 (poor) to 2 (good). A descriptive analysis was performed after 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (10 girls, median age: 13.9 (5.4-33.0) years) were included. Median age at diagnosis was 17.0 (3.0-76.9) months and age at start of cysteamine was 21.0 (15.5-116.3) months. Median daily dose of cysteamine was 1.05 (0.55-1.63) g/m2/day. Over the year, the median percentage of days with a good adherence score was 80 (1-99)% decreasing to 68 (1-99)% in patients > 11 years old. The median of average number of hours covered by treatment in a day was 22.5 (6.1-23.9) versus 14.9 (9.2-20.5) hours for delayed release versus short acting cysteamine. CONCLUSION: Our data are the first describing a rather good adherence to cysteamine, decreasing in adolescents and adults. We described a potential interest of the delayed release formulation. Our data highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach including therapeutic education and individualized approaches in NC patients transitioning to adulthood.

This study describes reported barriers and coping mechanisms to accessing healthcare among chronic care patients during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in Rwanda. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among chronic care patients enrolled in pediatric development, HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases, mental health, and oncology programs at 3 rural Rwandan districts. Active patients with an appointment scheduled between March-June 2020 and a phone number recorded in the electronic medical record system were eligible. Data were collected by telephone interviews between 23rd April and 11th May 2020, with proxy reporting by caregivers for children and critically ill-patients. Fisher's exact tests were used to measure associations. Logistic regression analysis was also used to assess factors associated with reporting at least one barrier to accessing healthcare during the lockdown. RESULTS: Of 220 patient respondents, 44% reported at least one barrier to accessing healthcare. Barriers included lack of access to emergency care (n = 50; 22.7%), lack of access to medication (n = 44; 20.0%) and skipping clinical appointments (n = 37; 16.8%). Experiencing barriers was associated with the clinical program (p < 0.001), with oncology patients being highly affected (64.5%), and with increasing distance from home to the health facility (p = 0.031). In the adjusted logistic regression model, reporting at least one barrier to accessing healthcare was associated with the patient's clinical program and district of residence. Forty (18.2%) patients identified positive coping mechanisms to ensure continuation of care, such as walking long distances during suspension of public transport (n = 21; 9.6%), contacting clinicians via telephone for guidance or rescheduling appointments (n = 15; 6.8%), and delegating someone else for medication pick-up (n = 6; 2.7%). Of 124 patients who reported no barriers to accessing healthcare, 9% used positive coping mechanisms. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of chronic care patients experienced barriers to accessing healthcare during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, many patients also independently identified positive coping mechanisms to ensure continuation of care - strategies that could be formally adopted by healthcare systems in Rwanda and similar settings to mitigate effects of future lockdowns on patients.","Nshimyiryo, Alphonse; Barnhart, Dale A; Cubaka, Vincent K; Dusengimana, Jean Marie Vianney; Dusabeyezu, Symaque; Ndagijimana, Deogratias; Umutesi, Grace; Shyirambere, Cyprien; Karema, Nadine; Mubiligi, Joel M; Kateera, Fredrick",BMC Public Health,601,24

Artemisinin-induced dormancy, shown in vitro and in animal models, provides a plausible explanation. To date, direct evidence of artemisinin-induced dormancy in humans is lacking. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from Plasmodium falciparum 3D7- or K13-infected participants before and 48-72 hours after single dose artesunate (AS) treatment. Parasite morphology, molecular signature of dormancy, capability and dynamics of seeding in vitro cultures, and genetic mutations in the K13 gene were investigated. RESULTS: Dormant parasites were observed in post-AS blood samples of 3D7- and K13-infected participants. The molecular signature of dormancy, an up-regulation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, was detected in 3D7 and K13 samples post-AS, but not in pre-AS samples. Post-treatment samples successfully seeded in vitro cultures, with a significant delay in time to reach 2% parasitemia compared to pre-treatment samples. CONCLUSION: This study provides strong evidence for the presence of artemisinin-induced dormant parasites in P. falciparum infections. These parasites are a likely reservoir for recrudescent infection following artemisinin monotherapy and artemisinin combination therapy (ACT). Combination regimens that target dormant parasites or remain at therapeutic levels for a sufficient time to kill recovering parasites will likely improve efficacy of ACTs.","Peatey, Christopher; Chen, Nanhua; Gresty, Karryn; Anderson, Karen; Pickering, Paul; Watts, Rebecca; Gatton, Michelle L; McCarthy, James; Cheng, Qin",J. infect. dis,601,16

Results: Compared with adult patients, pediatric patients had a shorter time of symptom onset to hospitalization than adults [median time, 1 ( IQR, 1.0-1.0) d vs. 3 ( IQR, 2.0-6.0) d, P < 0.001], milder or fewer symptoms, less severe chest CT findings. The clinical severity classification of children was less severe than adults. Up to 15 th March, the end of the follow-up, 33 (100%) children and 292 (97.3%) adult patients had been discharged from hospital. Only 2 (0.7%) adult patients died, with an overall case mortality of 0.6%. The median length of hospital stay of pediatric patients was shorter than that of adult patients [19 (95% CI: 16.6-21.4) d vs. 21 (95% CI: 19.9-22.1) d, P = 0.024]. Conclusion: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 had milder or less clinical symptoms, less evident pulmonary imaging changes, better prognosis, and shorter length of hospital stay.","Wang, Fang; Lai, Chang Xiang; Huang, Peng Yu; Liu, Jia Ming; Wang, Xian Feng; Tang, Qi Yuan; Zhou, Xuan; Xian, Wen Jie; Chen, Rui Kun; Li, Xuan; Li, Zhi Yu; Liao, Li Qun; He, Qing; Liu, Lei",Biomed Environ Sci,601,20

Despite typical manifestations of illness are dominated by respiratory symptom, some patients have concurrent gastrointestinal manifestations, including nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Massive gastrointestinal bleeding, however, has rarely been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We herein described a case of severe SARS-CoV-2 infected patient with several risk factors for poor prognosis, including male, hypertension, old age, mixed bacterial infection and multilobular infiltration on radiological imaging. After improvement of respiratory status, the onset of gastrointestinal bleeding occurred, probably resulting from direct viral invasion as evidenced by the positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in the repeat stool specimens. Although aggressive resuscitation was administered, hematochezia was uncontrolled. The patient rapidly deteriorated, suffered from cardiac arrest, and expired. CONCLUSIONS: Digestive symptoms could be severe in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, especially for the high-risk individuals with predisposing conditions. A more thorough protocol for preventing cross-infection through faecal-oral transmission should be implemented in the process of patient care and infection control.","Chen, Taojiang; Yang, Qin; Duan, Hongyu",BMC Gastroenterol,601,1

Although acute kidney injury, collapsing glomerulopathy and thrombotic micro-angiopathy have been frequently attributed to COVID-19, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (GN) has rarely been described [1]. Here we report a case of pauci-immune GN associated with SARS-CoV-2. Case Presentation: A 53 years old female with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C (treated 6 years ago), and recent covid-19 pneumonia (3 months ago), presented with dysuria, nausea, and vomiting. She denied fever, flank pain, and hematuria. The laboratory workup showed elevated blood urea nitrogen BUN 82 mg/dl and creatinine Cr 9.8 mg/dl (baseline creatinine was 0.9 mg/dl three months ago). Urinalysis showed proteinuria &gt;1000 mg/dl and urine protein creatinine ratio of 5.3 (normal &lt; 0.1), concerning for glomerulonephritis. Serological evaluation for glomerular disease showed normal complements C3 and C4, normal titers of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies including p-ANCA, c-ANCA, atypical ANCA, and cryoglobulins. Screening for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C was negative. The remainder of the autoimmune workup was unremarkable including Rheumatoid factor, Anti CCP antibodies (Ab), Anti Ribo-nucleoprotein Ab, and Anti Glomerular basement membrane antibodies. Coronavirus PCR was negative and qualitative IgG was reactive. CT chest showed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and resolving ground glass opacities from prior coronavirus infection. CT abdomen and pelvis was unremarkable for obstructive uropathy. The renal biopsy showed pauci-immune focal sclerosis with 20% fibro-cellular crescents diagnostic for pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. The patient was treated for pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with pulse-dose intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone) followed by oral prednisone and rituximab. The renal functions improved dramatically (on day 15, her creatinine down-trended to 4 mg/dl from 9mg/dl on admission). She did not require intermittent hemodialysis and was discharged on day 15 with outpatient follow up. Discussion: The mechanisms of acute kidney injury in COVID-19 include renal hypoperfusion, endothelial dysfunction, micro-thrombi, and cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 towards renal tubules and glomeruli. Due to a lack of scientific evidence related to coronavirus disease, the management of glomerulopathy is challenging. The existing literature favors the use of anti-viral therapy with immunosuppressive agents without the concern of worsening infection [2].","Waseem, H.; Zafar, F.; Anser, M.; Zia, M.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,601,16

It is not known whether sex hormones contribute to this predisposition. Objective: To investigate the association of concentrations of serum testosterone, estradiol, and insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1, concentrations of which are regulated by sex hormone signaling) with COVID-19 severity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study was conducted using serum samples collected from consecutive patients who presented from March through May 2020 to the Barnes Jewish Hospital in St Louis, Missouri, with COVID-19 (diagnosed using nasopharyngeal swabs). Exposures: Testosterone, estradiol, and IGF-1 concentrations were measured at the time of presentation (ie, day 0) and at days 3, 7, 14, and 28 after admission (if the patient remained hospitalized). Main Outcomes and Measures: Baseline hormone concentrations were compared among patients who had severe COVID-19 vs those with milder COVID-19 illness. RNA sequencing was performed on circulating mononuclear cells to understand the mechanistic association of altered circulating hormone concentrations with cellular signaling pathways. Results: Among 152 patients (90 [59.2%] men; 62 [40.8%] women; mean [SD] age, 63 [16] years), 143 patients (94.1%) were hospitalized. Among 66 men with severe COVID-19, median [interquartile range] testosterone concentrations were lower at day 0 (53 [18 to 114] ng/dL vs 151 [95 to 217] ng/dL; P = .01) and day 3 (19 [6 to 68] ng/dL vs 111 [49 to 274] ng/dL; P = .006) compared with 24 men with milder disease. Testosterone concentrations were inversely associated with concentrations of interleukin 6 (ß = -0.43; 95% CI, -0.52 to -0.17; P < .001), C-reactive protein (ß = -0.38; 95% CI, -0.78 to -0.16; P = .004), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (ß = -0.29; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.06; P = .02), hepatocyte growth factor (ß = -0.46; 95% CI, -0.69 to -0.25; P < .001), and interferon Î³-inducible protein 10 (ß = -0.32; 95% CI, -0.62 to -0.10; P = .007). Estradiol and IGF-1 concentrations were not associated with COVID-19 severity in men. Testosterone, estradiol, and IGF-1 concentrations were similar in women with and without severe COVID-19. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed upregulated hormone signaling pathways in CD14+CD16- (ie, classical) monocytes and CD14-CD16+ (ie, nonclassical) monocytes in male patients with COVID-19 who needed intensive care unit treatment vs those who did not. Conclusions and Relevance: In this single-center cohort study of patients with COVID-19, lower testosterone concentrations during hospitalization were associated with increased disease severity and inflammation in men. Hormone signaling pathways in monocytes did not parallel serum hormone concentrations, and further investigation is required to understand their pathophysiologic association with COVID-19.","Dhindsa, Sandeep; Zhang, Nan; McPhaul, Michael J; Wu, Zengru; Ghoshal, Amit K; Erlich, Emma C; Mani, Kartik; Randolph, Gwendalyn J; Edwards, John R; Mudd, Philip A; Diwan, Abhinav",JAMA Netw Open,601,22

This major challenge highlights the need for data compression techniques. In this study, we apply a physics-informed Deep Learning technique based on vector quantization to generate a discrete, low-dimensional representation of data from simulations of three-dimensional turbulent flows. The deep learning framework is composed of convolutional layers and incorporates physical constraints on the flow, such as preserving incompressibility and global statistical characteristics of the velocity gradients. The accuracy of the model is assessed using statistical, comparison-based similarity and physics-based metrics. The training data set is produced from Direct Numerical Simulation of an incompressible, statistically stationary, isotropic turbulent flow. The performance of this lossy data compression scheme is evaluated not only with unseen data from the stationary, isotropic turbulent flow, but also with data from decaying isotropic turbulence, a Taylor-Green vortex flow, and a turbulent channel flow. Defining the compression ratio (CR) as the ratio of original data size to the compressed one, the results show that our model based on vector quantization can offer CR$=85$ with a mean square error (MSE) of $O(10^{-3})$, and predictions that faithfully reproduce the statistics of the flow, except at the very smallest scales where there is some loss. Compared to the recent study of Glaws. et. al.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 10, 2020, to February 18, 2020. All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province were included, retrospectively. Quantitative CT measurements of pulmonary opacities including volume, density, and location were extracted by deep learning algorithm. Dynamic evolution of these measurements was investigated from symptom onset (day 1) to beyond day 15. Comparison was made between severity groups. RESULTS: A total of 484 patients (median age of 47 years, interquartile range 33-57) with 954 CT examinations were included, and each was assigned to one of the three groups: asymptomatic/mild (n = 63), moderate (n = 378), severe/critically ill (n = 43). Time series showed different evolution patterns of CT measurements in the groups. Following disease onset, posteroinferior subpleural area of the lung was the most common location for pulmonary opacities. Opacity volume continued to increase beyond 15 days in the severe/critically ill group, compared with peaking on days 13-15 in the moderate group. Asymptomatic/mild group had the lowest opacity volume which almost resolved after 15 days. The opacity density began to drop from day 10 to day 12 for moderately ill patients. CONCLUSIONS: Volume, density, and location of the pulmonary opacity and their evolution on CT varied with disease severity in COVID-19. These findings are valuable in understanding the nature of the disease and monitoring the patient's condition during the course of illness. KEY POINTS: â¢ Volume, density, and location of the pulmonary opacity on CT change over time in COVID-19. â¢ The evolution of CT appearance follows specific pattern, varying with disease severity.","Wang, Yuan-Cheng; Luo, Huanyuan; Liu, Songqiao; Huang, Shan; Zhou, Zhen; Yu, Qian; Zhang, Shijun; Zhao, Zhen; Yu, Yizhou; Yang, Yi; Wang, Duolao; Ju, Shenghong",Eur Radiol,601,24

As the health-care system is finally re-organizing to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, it was necessary to re-structure primary eye care (PEC) activities as well on the same lines. A consensus meeting was held with leading eye-care experts on 2nd May 2020 to prepare a roadmap for PEC in the days to come. Guidelines are needed for PEC activities like vision testing, refraction, optical dispensing, counseling, etc., Some of the activities at vision centers (VCs) may be postponed or modified in light of the current pandemic situation. PEC workers need to strictly follow social distancing norms (minimum 3 feet) for minimizing risk of exposure and need access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), like gloves, masks and shields while examining beneficiaries. For optometrists, sterilization of instruments and encouraging the people to remain silent during the examination is recommended. Because conjunctivitis may be an early sign which can present at VCs, extra precautions in the form of PPE has to be ensured while examining such patients. This is also an opportunity to start running telemedicine clinics for all emergent cases that cannot be managed at the primary level.

Data were collected to determine whether specific patients are better suited to VC, and to quantify the true benefit of VC in patients that successfully attended. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively on predetermined data collection forms, including consultation duration, diagnosis, management plan, and issues that arose. RESULTS: 37.8% of new referrals and 60.9% of return patients were vetted as suitable for VC. Of those invited to attend, 83.4% agreed to a VC appointment. Of the patients appointed to a VC clinic, 71.7% (new)/75% (return) successfully completed VC, 14.9%/15.8% attempted a VC which ultimately failed, and 13.4%/9.2% did not attend. VC successfully prevented face-to-face consultation in 81.3% of new cases and 91.1% of returns. Ectropion, entropion and dermatochalasis (new referrals), and postoperative follow-up (return patients) were well suited to VC, while patients with ""watery eye"" (new), and lid or conjunctival lesions (return), often required face-to-face consultation. Problems (most common issues with patients connecting to the consultation, video quality, and audio quality) were encountered during 50.3% of calls, although 82.6% of attempted calls were ultimately successful. Age was not associated with the proportion of calls that were successful. CONCLUSIONS: VC is a useful tool for oculoplastic patients, irrespective of age, as long as the patient's notes/referrals are carefully vetted to determine suitability. Patients with ectropion, entropion and dermatochalasis, and postoperative reviews are better suited to VC than those with ""watery eye,"" lid lesions, and conjunctival lesions.","Jamison, Aaron; Diaper, Charles; Drummond, Suzannah; Tejwani, Deepak; Gregory, Maria Elena; Cauchi, Paul; Crofts, Kevin; Chadha, Vikas",,601,21

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two-hundred fifty-six sera from 101 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR) and 50 control sera were tested for IgM/IgG using the NG-Test IgM-IgG COVID all-in-one assay. The seroconversion dynamic was assessed by symptom onset and day of RT-PCR diagnosis. RESULTS: Among the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, positive IgG and/or IgM result was observed for 67.3% of patients (68/101), including 17 (16.8%) already positive at the day of RT-PCR, and 51 (50.5%) with observable seroconversion, and 32.7% (33/101) remained negative as subsequent sampling was not possible due to patient discharge or death. The sensitivity increased with the delay between onset of symptoms and sampling, going from 29.1%, 78.2% and 86.5% for the time periods of 0-9-, 10-14- and >14-days after the onset of symptoms, respectively. Cumulative sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value and Negative Predictive Value were 97·0%, 100%, 100% and 96·2%, respectively 15-days after the onset of symptoms. No difference in seroconversion delay was observed regardless of whether patients received ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: The NG-test is a bedside serological assay that could serve as a complementary source of diagnostic information to RT-PCR and chest imaging. It may also be useful to monitor immunological status of medical and non-medical workers during the ongoing pandemic, and the general population after social distancing measures have eased.","Dortet, Laurent; Emeraud, Cecile; Vauloup-Fellous, Christelle; Khecharem, Mouna; Ronat, Jean-Baptiste; Fortineau, Nicolas; Roque-Afonso, Anne-Marie; Naas, Thierry",Emerg Microbes Infect,601,20

Hospitals need to plan in advance to ensure that their systems can adapt to a rapidly changing environment if necessary. This review provides an overview of 10 general principles that hospitals and health-care systems should consider when developing disaster plans. The principles are consistent with an ""all-hazards"" approach to disaster mitigation. This approach is adapted to planning for a multiplicity of threats but emphasizes highly relevant scenarios, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We also describe specific ways these principles helped prepare our hospital for this pandemic. Key points include acting quickly, identifying and engaging key stakeholders early, providing accurate information, prioritizing employee safety and mental health, promoting a fully integrated clinical response, developing surge plans, preparing for ethical dilemmas, and having a cogent exit strategy for post-disaster recovery.","Orsini, Erica; Mireles-Cabodevila, Eduardo; Ashton, Rendell; Khouli, Hassan; Chaisson, Neal",Chest,601,20

The low probability and rare occurrence of such events, however, impose severe sampling and computational requirements on classical solution methods that render them impractical. This work proposes a novel sampling-free method for solving rare chance constrained optimization problems affected by uncertainties that follow general Gaussian mixture distributions. By integrating modern developments in large deviation theory with tools from convex analysis and bilevel optimization, we propose tractable formulations that can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Our formulations enjoy several advantages compared to classical methods: their size and complexity is independent of event rarity, they do not require linearity or convexity assumptions on system constraints, and under easily verifiable conditions, serve as safe conservative approximations or asymptotically exact reformulations of the true problem. Computational experiments on linear, nonlinear and PDE-constrained problems from applications in portfolio management, structural engineering and fluid dynamics illustrate the broad applicability of our method and its advantages over classical sampling-based approaches in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.","Tong, Shanyin; Subramanyam, Anirudh; Rao, Vishwas",,601,16

At the time of this review, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in over 40 million cases and associated with 1.1 million deaths worldwide. Current management strategies for COVID-19 are largely supportive, and while there are more than 2000 interventional clinical trials registered with the U.S. National Library of Medicine (clinicaltrials.gov), results that can clarify benefits and risks of candidate therapies are only gradually becoming available. We herein describe recent advances in understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology and potential therapeutic targets that are involved in viral entry into host cells, viral spread in the body, and the subsequent COVID-19 progression. We highlight two major lines of therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment: 1) repurposing the existing drugs for use in COVID-19 patients, such as antiviral medications (e.g., remdesivir) and immunomodulators (e.g., dexamethasone) which were previously approved for other disease conditions, and 2) novel biological products that are designed to target specific molecules that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, including neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, such as REGN-COV2 (an antibody cocktail), as well as recombinant human soluble ACE2 protein to counteract SARS-CoV-2 binding to the transmembrane ACE2 receptor in target cells. Finally, we discuss potential drug resistance mechanisms and provide thoughts regarding clinical trial design to address the diversity in COVID-19 clinical manifestation.

Objective: To characterize mental state and ocular surface state of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and similar areas during the COVID-19 outbreak. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study assessed ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and Jiangxi, China, a province approximately 300 km south of Wuhan. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index were used to conduct questionnaire surveys via a messaging and social media app. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean scores from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (0-10 points), the Van Dream Anxiety Scale (0-100 points), and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (0-100 points). Results: Of 126 individuals, there were 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 ophthalmic nurses (16.7%) from Wuhan and 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 nurses (16.7%) from Jiangxi. The mean (SD) age of ophthalmologists was 36.1 (7.6) years in Wuhan and 41.2 (8.8) years in Jiangxi. For ophthalmic nurses, the mean (SD) age was 35.2 (7.4) years in Wuhan and 33.4 (7.9) years in Jiangxi. The response rate for ophthalmologists was 90.3% (84 of 93) and for nurses was 91.3% (42 of 46). The participation rate of ophthalmologists and nurses in Wuhan was 0.06% (42 of 70â¯000) and 0.07% (21 of 30â¯000), respectively; the participation rate in Jiangxi was 0.06% (42 of 70â¯000; 21 of 35â¯000) for both groups. In Wuhan, the mean (SD) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety and depression were counted as separate scores), Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index scores were 6.90 (2.30), 7.38 (2.19), 24.52 (5.86), and 43.90 (3.74), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 8.67 (3.04), 9.38 (2.64), 21.48 (6.15), and 40.05 (6.67), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. In Jiangxi, these scores were 5.67 (2.89), 4.90 (3.15), 12.76 (7.27), and 38.79 (7.78), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 4.67 (3.20), 4.33 (3.23), 10.10 (7.62), and 41.52 (5.92), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. The difference (95% CI) between the 2 regions for these scores in ophthalmologists was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.30-3.65), 11.76 (95% CI, 8.90-14.63), 5.12 (95% CI, 2.45-7.79), and 5.12 (95% CI, 2.47-7.77), respectively, and in ophthalmic nurses was 4.16 (95% CI, 2.05-5.95), 5.05 (95% CI, 3.21-6.89), 11.38 (95% CI, 7.06-15.70), and -1.48 (95% CI, -5.41 to 2.25), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan experienced more anxiety and depression and reported greater ocular surface abnormalities than counterparts outside of Wuhan, but the wide CIs preclude concluding confidently that there were differences.","Shao, Yi; Zhang, Wei",JAMA Ophthalmol,601,16

The aim of this study is to evaluate if lung ultrasound (LUS) was able to highlight typical interstitial lung lesions in children with persistent cough and suspected CV19, providing corroborating evidence of CV19 infection. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the data of 32 children who came consecutively to our outpatient observation in the period between March 1st and April 30th, 2020 because of the presence of persistent cough for at least 3 days and with suspected CV19. All the children undergone clinical examination, oximetry measurement and LUS. RESULTS: Twenty over thirty-two children had US lesions compatible with the presence of CV19, many of them without clinical signs of respiratory distress. LUS is much more sensitive than clinical examination to detect lung injury in children with suspected CV19. CONCLUSION: In the absence of reliable, highly sensitive diagnostic tests or when nasal swab is unworkable or there are too many requests to be performed quickly due to the pandemic, LUS should be used in children with persistent cough for whom a CV19 is suspected because it can highlight undiagnosed interstitial lung lesions and reinforce the diagnostic suspicion of CV19 This approach can be very useful in outpatient settings and in areas with limited medical resources such as developing countries.","Gregori, Giuseppe; Sacchetti, Roberto",Ital J Pediatr,601,20

However, making high-resolution bathymetric charts requires measuring underwater depths at many points in sea areas, and thus, is time-consuming and costly. In this work, treating gridded bathymetric data as digital images, we employ the image-processing technique known as superresolution to enhance the resolution of bathymetric charts by estimating high-resolution images from low-resolution ones. Specifically, we use the recently-developed deep-learning methodology to automatically learn the geometric features of ocean floors and recover their details. Through an experiment using bathymetric data around Japan, we confirmed that the proposed method outperforms naive interpolation both qualitatively and quantitatively, observing an eight-dB average improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio. Deep-learning-based bathymetric image superresolution can significantly reduce the number of sea areas or points that must be measured, thereby accelerating the detailed mapping of the seafloor and the creation of high-resolution bathymetric charts around the globe.","Sonogashira, Motoharu; Shonai, Michihiro; Iiyama, Masaaki",PLoS One,601,24

Left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction is the most frequent cardiac finding. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study we report on detailed assessment of LV function in MIS-C patients using strain and strain rate analysis. We compare those with normal peak systolic strain z-scores (both longitudinal and circumferential strain) to those with abnormal peak systolic strain z-scores (decreased circumferential and/or longitudinal strain). Results: Among 25 patients, 14 (56%) were male, 20 (80%) were Black or Hispanic, 13 (52%) were overweight/obese, and median age was 11.4 years (IQR, 7.5 to 16). Median ejection fraction (EF) was 55.2% (IQR, 48.3 to 58%) with the abnormal strain patients having lower EF (p<0.01). Demographics were similar between groups. The abnormal strain patients had more organ systems involved and were more likely to require inotropic support. When comparing MIS-C patients with normal EF (n=15) to controls, MIS-C patients had lower peak systolic strain as well as lower early diastolic strain rates. In patients with initially depressed function, EF normalized in 8/10 (80%) but 4/11 (36%) patients had persistently abnormal systolic strain after discharge. Conclusion: Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is common in the acute phase of MIS-C and detection may be improved with strain imaging. Longitudinal cardiac follow-up is imperative as some patients may be at risk for persistent LV dysfunction.","Kobayashi, Ryan; Dionne, Audrey; Ferraro, Alessandra; Harrild, David; Newburger, Jane; VanderPluym, Christina; Gauvreau, Kim; Son, Mary Beth; Lee, Pui; Baker, Annette; de Ferranti, Sarah; Friedman, Kevin G",,601,23

The present study showed that the potential therapeutic natural compound auraptene (AUR) enhances junction assembly in cerebrovascular endothelial cells by inducing antioxidant enzymes and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR). Treatment of mouse cerebrovascular endothelial cells with AUR enhanced the expression of junctional proteins, such as occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), by increasing the levels of mRNA encoding antioxidant enzymes. AUR treatment also resulted in the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of mtUPR. The ability of AUR to protect against ischemic conditions was further assessed using cells deprived of oxygen and glucose. Pretreatment of these cells with AUR protected against damage to junctional proteins, including occludin, claudin-5, ZO-1 and VE-cadherin, accompanied by a stress resilience response regulated by levels of ATF5, LONP1 and HSP60 mRNAs. Collectively, these results indicate that AUR promotes resilience against oxidative stress and improves junction assembly, suggesting that AUR may help maintain intact barriers in cerebrovascular endothelial cells.","Lee, Min Joung; Jang, Yunseon; Zhu, Jiebo; Namgung, Eunji; Go, Dahyun; Seo, Changjun; Ju, Xianshu; Cui, Jianchen; Lee, Yu Lim; Kang, Hyoeun; Kim, Hyeongseok; Chung, Woosuk; Heo, Jun Young",,601,23

The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, which has infected over 2,300,000 individuals and caused over 150,000 deaths, is an example of one of these catastrophic events. OBJECTIVE: We present a timely and novel methodology that combines disease estimates from mechanistic models and digital traces, via interpretable machine learning methodologies, to reliably forecast COVID-19 activity in Chinese provinces in real time. METHODS: Our method uses the following as inputs: (a) official health reports, (b) COVID-19-related internet search activity, (c) news media activity, and (d) daily forecasts of COVID-19 activity from a metapopulation mechanistic model. Our machine learning methodology uses a clustering technique that enables the exploitation of geospatial synchronicities of COVID-19 activity across Chinese provinces and a data augmentation technique to deal with the small number of historical disease observations characteristic of emerging outbreaks. RESULTS: Our model is able to produce stable and accurate forecasts 2 days ahead of the current time and outperforms a collection of baseline models in 27 out of 32 Chinese provinces. CONCLUSIONS: Our methodology could be easily extended to other geographies currently affected by COVID-19 to aid decision makers with monitoring and possibly prevention.","Liu, Dianbo; Clemente, Leonardo; Poirier, Canelle; Ding, Xiyu; Chinazzi, Matteo; Davis, Jessica; Vespignani, Alessandro; Santillana, Mauricio",J Med Internet Res,601,20

The objective of this study is to assess the status of the Government of Nepal designated COVID hospitals and COVID clinics to respond against COVID-19. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted with the focal persons of COVID hospitals and COVID clinics using a semi-structured questionnaire from April 26, 2020 to May 27, 2020 via face to face interview with onsite observation and telephonic interview in few unreachable health facilities. Results: Government of Nepal designated COVID hospitals and COVID clinics demonstrated efforts in establishing preparedness plans and committees such as COVID management core team (96.7% and 86%), provision of coordination with the government authority (both 100% ), preparedness response plan (93.3% and 84%), and infection prevention and control committee (63.3% and 65.6%) to respond to COVID-19 respectively.

We assessed the association between chronic use of RAAS blockers and mortality among inpatients with COVID-19 and explored reasons for discrepancies in the literature. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included adult hypertensive patients from a prospective nationwide cohort of 3512 inpatients with COVID-19 up to June 30, 2020. Cox proportional hazard models with various adjustment or propensity weighting methods were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) of 30-day mortality for chronic users versus non-users of RAAS blockers. We analyzed data of 1160 hypertensive patients: 719 (62%) were male and 777 (67%) were older than 65 years. The main comorbidities were diabetes (n = 416, 36%), chronic cardiac disease (n = 401, 35%), and obesity (n = 340, 29%); 705 (61%) received oxygen therapy. We recorded 135 (11.6%) deaths within 30 days of diagnosis. We found no association between chronic use of RAAS blockers and mortality (unadjusted HR = 1.13, 95% CI [0.8-1.6]; propensity inverse probability treatment weighted HR = 1.09 [0.86-1.39]; propensity standardized mortality ratio weighted HR = 1.08 [0.79-1.47]). Our comprehensive review of previous studies highlighted that significant associations were mostly found in unrestricted populations with inappropriate adjustment, or with biased in-hospital exposure measurement. CONCLUSION: Our results do not support previous concerns regarding these drugs, nor a potential protective effect as reported in previous poorly designed studies and meta-analyses. RAAS blockers should not be discontinued during the pandemic, while in-hospital management of these drugs will be clarified by randomized trials.

Among several drug candidates, chloroquine (CQN) and hydroxychloroquine (H-CQN) were tested intensively, and any contentious therapeutic effect of both has been discussed controversially in the light of severe side effects and missing efficacy. Originally, H-CQN descended from the natural substance quinine, a medicinal product used since the Middle Ages, which actually is regulatory approved for various indications. We hypothesized that quinine also exerts anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. In Vero cells, quinine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection more effectively than CQN, and H-CQN and was less toxic. In human Caco-2 colon epithelial cells as well as the lung cell line A549 stably expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2, quinine also showed antiviral activity. In consistence with Vero cells, quinine was less toxic in A549 as compared to CQN and H-CQN. Finally, we confirmed our findings in Calu-3 lung cells, expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 endogenously. In Calu-3, infections with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 were completely blocked by quinine, CQN, and H-CQN in concentrations above 50 µM. The estimated IC50s were ~25 µM in Calu-3, while overall, the inhibitors exhibit IC50 values between ~3.7 to ~50 µM, dependent on the cell line and multiplicity of infection (MOI). Conclusively, our data indicate that quinine could have the potential of a treatment option for SARS-CoV-2, as the toxicological and pharmacological profile seems more favorable when compared to its progeny drugs H-CQN or CQN.","Große, Maximilian; Ruetalo, Natalia; Layer, Mirjam; Hu, Dan; Businger, Ramona; Rheber, Sascha; Setz, Christian; Rauch, Pia; Auth, Janina; Fröba, Maria; Brysch, Ekkehard; Schindler, Michael; Schubert, Ulrich",Viruses,601,5

Physical, cognitive and psychological consequences seem to be realistic; however, do residual symptoms in patients who have returned to microbiological normalization constitute a post-COVID syndrome and which symptoms are principally possible in this context and are able to cause such a syndrome? It is no novelty that critically ill patients often still sustain functional limitations over a long period after discharge from hospital, in many cases even over many years. In most cases of COVID-19 it is too early for the diagnosis of a post-COVID syndrome. For this the symptoms would have to have lasted over a period of at least 6 months; therefore, only a post-infection fatigue can currently be spoken of. On top of this, even if patients recover physically they could be at particular risk of suffering from long-term mental health problems or perceive a reduced quality of life. Such findings exist not only after ARDS as many intensive care unit patients sustain long-term disorders, which is also known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). To sum up, there is sufficient evidence for the possible existence of a post-COVID syndrome or for the justification to correspondingly designate these possible sequelae with persisting symptoms in this way.

Until now, abstract models for describing the structural logic of studies in environmental sciences are lacking and tools for data management are insufficient. Mandatory for repeatability and reproducibility is the use of sophisticated data management solutions going beyond data file sharing. Particularly, it implies maintenance of coherent data along workflows. Design data concern elements from elementary domains of operations being transformation, measurement and transaction. Operation design elements and method information are specified for each consecutive workflow segment from field to laboratory campaigns. The strict linkage of operation design element values, operation values and objects is essential. For enabling coherence of corresponding objects along consecutive workflow segments, the assignment of unique identifiers and the specification of their relations are mandatory. The abstract model presented here addresses these aspects, and the software DiversityDescriptions (DWB-DD) facilitates the management of thusly connected digital data objects and structures. DWB-DD allows for an individual specification of operation design elements and their linking to objects. Two workflow design use cases, one for DNA barcoding and another for cultivation of fungal isolates, are given. To publish those structured data, standard schema mapping and XML-provision of digital objects are essential. Schemas useful for this mapping include the Ecological Markup Language, the Schema for Meta-omics Data of Collection Objects and the Standard for Structured Descriptive Data. Data pipelines with DWB-DD include the mapping and conversion between schemas and functions for data publishing and archiving according to the Open Archival Information System standard.

Disparities result in a disproportionately higher prevalence of disease or lower standard of care provided to the index group. Multiple theories exist regarding the genesis of this disturbing finding. The COVID-19 pandemic has had the unfortunate effect of amplifying health inequity in vulnerable populations. African Americans, who make up approximately 12% of the US population are reportedly being diagnosed with COVID-19 and dying at disproportionately higher rates. Viewed holistically, multiple factors are contributing to the perfect storm: 1) Limited availability of public testing, 2) A dramatic increase in low wage worker unemployment/health insurance loss especially in the service sector of the economy, 3) High rates of preexisting chronic disease states/reduced access to early healthcare and 4) Individual provider and structural healthcare system bias. Indeed, COVID-19 represents a pandemic superimposed on a historic epidemic of racial health inequity and healthcare disparities. Therapeutic solutions are not expected in the near term.

BACKGROUND: During the unprecedented era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of countries worldwide adopted very strong measures. Universities closed their doors, and education continued through digital learning lectures. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was administered to all 189 eligible candidates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health was assessed via the MH domain of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and burnout with the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 81.5%. The overall burnout prevalence did not differ significantly between the two periods (pre-COVID-19 18.1% vs. COVID-19 18.2%). However, the burnout prevalence dropped significantly in year 4 (pre-COVID-19 40.7% vs. COVID-19 16.7%, p = 0.011), whereas it increased significantly in year 6 (pre-COVID-19 27.6% vs. COVID-19 50%, p = 0.01). When looking at each MBI-SS dimension separately, we found that emotional exhaustion decreased significantly in year 4 but increased in year 6, and cynicism increased in all years. The overall MH deteriorated significantly between the two periods (pre-COVID-19 58.8 ± 21.6 vs. COVID-19 48.3 ± 23, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Digital learning in medical studies carries significant risks. Not only does the MH deteriorate, but cynicism levels also increase. Emotional exhaustion was found to increase particularly in final year students, who struggle with the lack of clinical experience just before they start working as qualified junior doctors.","Zis, Panagiotis; Artemiadis, Artemios; Bargiotas, Panagiotis; Nteveros, Antonios; Hadjigeorgiou, Georgios M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),601,21

A key concern are neurological and long-term cognitive complications. At the same time, the prevalence and nature of the cognitive sequalae of COVID-19 are unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the frequency, pattern and severity of cognitive impairments 3-4 months after COVID-19 hospital discharge, their relation to subjective cognitive complaints, quality of life and illness variables. We recruited patients at their follow-up visit at the respiratory outpatient clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg, approximately four months after hospitalisation with COVID-19. Patients underwent pulmonary, functional and cognitive assessments. Twenty-nine patients were included. The percentage of patients with clinically significant cognitive impairment ranged from 59% to 65% depending on the applied cut-off for clinical relevance of cognitive impairment, with verbal learning and executive functions being most affected. Objective cognitive impairment scaled with subjective cognitive complaints, lower work function and poorer quality of life. Cognitive impairments were associated with d-dimer levels during acute illness and residual pulmonary dysfunction. In conclusion, these findings provide new evidence for frequent cognitive sequelae of COVID-19 and indicate an association with the severity of the lung affection and potentially restricted cerebral oxygen delivery. Further, the associations with quality of life and functioning call for systematic cognitive screening of patients after recovery from severe COVID-19 illness and implementation of targeted treatments for patients with persistent cognitive impairments.","Miskowiak, K W; Johnsen, S; Sattler, S M; Nielsen, S; Kunalan, K; Rungby, J; Lapperre, T; Porsberg, C M",Eur Neuropsychopharmacol,601,1

Objective: To evaluate the comparative performance of PE-owned nursing homes on COVID-19 outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study of 11â¯470 US nursing homes used the Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File from May 17, 2020, to July 2, 2020, to compare outcomes of PE-owned nursing homes with for-profit, nonprofit, and government-owned homes, adjusting for facility characteristics. Exposure: Nursing home ownership status. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths and deaths by any cause per 1000 residents; possessing 1-week supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE); staffing shortages. Results: Of 11â¯470 nursing homes, 7793 (67.9%) were for-profit; 2523 (22.0%), nonprofit; 511 (5.3%), government-owned; and 543 (4.7%), PE-owned; with mean (SD) COVID-19 cases per 1000 residents of 88.3 [2.1], 67.0 [3.8], 39.8 [7.6] and 110.8 [8.1], respectively. Mean (SD) COVID-19 deaths per 1000 residents were 61.9 [1.6], 66.4 [3.0], 56.2 [7.3], and 78.9 [5.9], respectively; mean deaths by any cause per 1000 residents were 78.1 [1.3], 91.5 [2.2], 67.6 [4.5], and 87.9 [4.8], respectively. In adjusted analyses, government-owned homes had 35.5 (95% CI, -69.2 to -1.8; P = .03) fewer COVID-19 cases per 1000 residents than PE-owned nursing homes. Cases in PE-owned nursing homes were not statistically different compared with for-profit and nonprofit facilities; nor were there statistically significant differences in COVID-19 deaths or deaths by any cause between PE-owned nursing homes and for-profit, nonprofit, and government-owned facilities. For-profit, nonprofit, and government-owned nursing homes were 10.5% (9.1 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.8 to 16.3 percentage points; P = .006), 15.0% (13.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.5 to 20.6 percentage points; P < .001), and 17.0% (14.8 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.5 to 23.0 percentage points; P < .001), respectively, more likely to have at least a 1-week supply of N95 masks than PE-owned nursing homes. They were 24.3% (21.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 11.8 to 30.8 percentage points; P < .001), 30.7% (27.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 17.7 to 36.2 percentage points; P < .001), and 29.2% (25.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 16.1 to 35.3 percentage points; P < .001) more likely to have a 1-week supply of medical gowns than PE-owned nursing homes.

However, little is known about the psychosocial implications of COVID-19. This study set out to determine the rate as well as correlates of anxiety and depressive symptoms among persons managed as in-patients for COVID-19 in Lagos, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: We conducted an online survey between April to June ending 2020 using a consecutive sampling technique of persons positive for COVID-19 and who were managed as in-patients across five (5) treatment centers in Lagos, Nigeria. The survey collected information on demographic as well as clinical data including suicidality. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: There were one hundred and sixty participants in total. The mean age of respondents was 36.4 (±9.7) years with a higher proportion (56.9%) being males. With regards to diagnosis, 28.1% and 27.5% of the respondents were categorised as probable cases of depression and anxiety respectively, while 3.8% respondents reported suicidal ideation. Majority of the respondents (61.9%) reported the fear of infecting their loved ones. The variables that showed association with psychiatric morbidity were a past history of an emotional concern, employment status, guilt about infecting others and boredom. Conclusion: This study revealed a high burden of psychological/psychiatric morbidity among persons treated for COVID-19, particularly persons who have had prior emotional concerns. The findings from this study reiterate the need to pay attention to the mental health of people during disease outbreaks and to incorporate psychosocial interventions as part of the management package.","Fadipe, Babatunde; Oshodi, Yewande O; Umeh, Charles; Aikomo, Kehinde; Ajirotutu, Omotayo Francis; Kajero, Jaiyeola; Fashanu, Chizoba; Adeoye, Adefemi A; Coker, Ayodele Olurotimi; Sokunbi, Modupe; Nyamali, Veronica Oluyemisi; Ajomale, Tolu; Gbadebo, Adesoji; Oni, Adedapo; Keshinro, Ajibola Oladimeji; Ngozi Ejiegbu, Teniola Anne; Bowale, Abimbola; Akase, Iorhen E; Mutiu, Bamidele; Adebayo, Bisola; Abdus-Salam, Ismail; Bode, Chris; Osibogun, Akin",Brain Behav Immun Health,601,2

HCWs perceived risks of contracting COVID-19, in relation to depression were investigated. It was hypothesized that perceived high risk of contracting COVID-19 (close contact with cases, inadequate provision of personal protective equipment, insufficient infection control training, and presence of symptoms) would be significant predictors of depression. Our cross-sectional survey was completed by HCWs across three regions (Hubei, Guangdong, Hong Kong) between March 9 to April 9 2020 using convenience sampling. Depression was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Prevalence of depression was 50.4% (95% CI: 44.5-56.2), 15.1% (10.1-21.9) and 12.9% (10.3-16.2) for HCWs in Hong Kong, Hubei and Guangdong, respectively. The strongest significant risk factors for depression, after adjustment, were HCWs who reported the greatest extent of feeling susceptible to contracting COVID-19 and those who reported the greatest difficulty obtaining face masks. HCWs whose family/peers greatly encouraged face mask use had lower prevalence of depression. Access to adequate supplies of personal protective equipment is essential for the psychological health of HCWs working in stressful environments, through potentially easing their perceptions of vulnerability to COVID-19.","Lam, Simon Ching; Arora, Teresa; Grey, Ian; Suen, Lorna Kwai Ping; Huang, Emma Yun-Zhi; Li, Daofan; Lam, Kin Bong Hubert",Front Psychiatry,601,16

The prior detection and diagnosis can decrease the occurrence of acute vision loss and enhance efficiency of treatment. Fundus imaging, a non-invasive diagnostic technique, is the most frequently used mode for analyzing retinal abnormalities related to diabetic retinopathy. Computer-aided methods based on retinal fundus images support quick diagnosis, impart an additional perspective during decision-making, and behave as an efficient means to assess response of treatment on retinal abnormalities. However, in order to evaluate computer-aided systems, a benchmark database of clinical retinal fundus images is required. Therefore, a representative database comprising of 2942 clinical retinal fundus images is developed and presented in this work. This clinical database, having varying attributes such as position, dimensions, shapes, and color, is formed to evaluate the generalization capability of computer-aided systems for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. A framework for the development of benchmark retinal fundus images database is also proposed. The developed database comprises of medical image annotations for each image from expert ophthalmologists corresponding to anatomical structures, retinal lesions and stage of diabetic retinopathy.

As with the original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic information systems and methods, including, among other application possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past.

Some data suggest that early administration of diuretics would shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation. However, this strategy may expose patients to a higher risk of haemodynamic and metabolic complications. Currently, there is no recommendation for the use of diuretics during weaning and there is an equipoise on the timing of their initiation in this context. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing two strategies of fluid removal during weaning in 13 French intensive care units (ICU). The preventive strategy is initiated systematically when the fluid balance or weight change is positive and the patients have criteria for clinical stability; the curative strategy is initiated only in case of weaning failure documented as of cardiac origin. Four hundred and ten patients will be randomised with a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is the duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation, defined as the number of days between randomisation and successful extubation (alive without reintubation nor tracheostomy within the 7 days after extubation) at day 28. Secondary outcomes include daily and cumulated fluid balance, metabolic and haemodynamic complications, ventilator-associated pneumonia, weaning complications, number of ventilator-free days, total duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in ICU and mortality in ICU, in hospital and, at day 28. A subgroup analysis for the primary outcome is planned in patients with kidney injury (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes class 2 or more) at the time of randomisation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Paris 1) and patients will be included after informed consent.

METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study of 11 Israeli pediatric emergency departments (ED) was conducted. Children with T1D who attended the ED between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 were compared with those who attended the ED between March 1, 2019 and May 31, 2019. RESULTS: Overall, 150 and 154 children with T1D attended the EDs during the 3-month study periods in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Among patients with established T1D, DKA rates significantly increased in 2020 compared to 2019 [38/64 (59.3%) vs 31/74 (41.9%); p < 0.043]. There was a non-statistically significant trend toward a higher rate of DKA in patients with newly diagnosed T1D [46/86 (53.4%) vs 31/80 (38.7%); p = 0.063]. No differences were observed in the rates of severe DKA in 2020 compared to 2019 among patients with established T1D [10/64 (15.6%) vs 6/74 (8.1%); p = 0.184], and newly diagnosed T1D [16/86 (18.6%) vs 14/80 (17.5%); p = 0.858]. No differences were observed in the rates of intensive care unit admissions in 2020 compared to 2019 among patients with established T1D [14/64 (21.8%) vs 14/74 (18.9%); p = 0.672], and newly diagnosed T1D [26/86 (30.2%) vs 21/80 (26.2%); p = 0.977]. CONCLUSIONS: Increased rates of DKA in children with established T1D were observed during the first 3 months of the outbreak in Israel.

Essas pessoas lidam com o desamparo institucionalizado, e a pandemia da Covid-19 expôs ainda mais essa situação. Quanto à formação dos profissionais de saúde, torna-se fundamental a abordagem do tema. Relato de Experiência: Com base na inclusão de experiências de docentes que articulavam ações de integração ensino-serviço com a equipe do Consultório na Rua de Mossoró, bem como a abordagem de temas relacionados às populações mais vulneráveis em eixo longitudinal ao curso, despertou-se o interesse dos discentes do curso de Medicina da Ufersa para ações direcionadas à PSR. Destarte, surge, em 2019, a ação ""Saúde nas Ruas"", em parceria com o Consultório na Rua, que fornece suporte à PSR em diversos aspectos, com a participação dos alunos do curso de Medicina. A ação, proposta a partir de iniciativa dos próprios alunos, marcou o início do planejamento da inclusão do atendimento a essa população no programa do internato do curso, bem como a criação de um projeto de extensão longitudinal para ações voltadas à PSR. Nesse processo, os discentes puderam imergir na realidade dessa população, e os usuários tiveram autonomia para compartilhar suas experiências e dores. Discussão: Mediante uma formação acadêmica que visa romper com o modelo tecnicista, os estudantes possibilitaram voz à PSR e, compreendendo essas pessoas como sujeitos do processo, refletiram sobre o agir médico na transformação da realidade em que se inserem. Conclusão: O corpo acadêmico participante potencializou em si a empatia e o desejo por uma saúde pública democrática e acessível.

Mental and behavioral disorders may be the manifestations or complications of acute COVID-19, such as acute psychotic disorders, more often in the form of hyperactive delirium, cognitive impairment, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, depression, and suicide attempts. The post-Covid period is also represented by a wide range of mental disorders, when cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, and PTSD come to the fore. The problem of early diagnosis and complex therapy of mental disorders associated with COVID-19 at all stages of the disease can be successfully solved using a holistic psychosomatic approach. Medical and psychological support and counseling psychiatric care are provided mainly in the mode of telemedicine. When prescribing psychotropic drugs, the doctor should take into account the risk of drug interactions: lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, and antibiotics often give potentially dangerous combinations with psychotropic drugs in the treatment of acute COVID-19. At the same time, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, and anakinra can be used concomitantly with psychotropic drugs without significant risk of drug interaction (except for the hematological risk with clozapine and baricitinib). The article presents international and national recommendations for the selection of the most effective therapy for mental disorders (antipsychotics, antidepressants, thymostabilizers, and anxiolytics) during acute COVID-19, indicating the doses and mode of administration.

During nonpandemic semesters at their institutes (e.g. universities), educators can directly provide students the software environment needed to support their learning - either in specialized computer laboratories (e.g. computational chemistry labs) or shared computer spaces. These labs are often supported by staff that maintains the operating systems (OS) and software. But how does one provide a specialized software environment for remote teaching? One solution is to provide students a customized operating system (e.g., Linux) that includes open-source software for supporting your teaching goals. However, such a solution should not require students to install the OS alongside their existing one (i.e. dual/multi-booting) or be used as a complete replacement. Such approaches are risky because of a) the students' possible lack of software expertise, b) the possible disruption of an existing software workflow that is needed in other classes or by other family members, and c) the importance of maintaining a working computer when isolated (e.g. societal restrictions). To illustrate possible solutions, we discuss our approach that used a customized Linux OS and a Docker container in a course that teaches computational chemistry and Python3.","Thomas, Gerlach Schauer Lukas Rademacher Michael Heiden Wolfgang Kirschner Karl",,601,11

METHODS: In this unmatched (1:2) case-control validation study, we used sera of 181 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and 326 controls collected before SARS-CoV-2 emergence. Diagnostic accuracy of the immunoassay was assessed against a whole spike protein-based recombinant immunofluorescence assay (rIFA) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Discrepant cases between ELISA and rIFA were further tested by pseudo-neutralization assay. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients were more likely to be male and older than controls, and 50.3% were hospitalized. ROC curve analyses indicated that IgG and IgA had high diagnostic accuracies with AUCs of 0.990 (95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 0.983-0.996) and 0.978 (95%CI: 0.967-0.989), respectively. IgG assays outperformed IgA assays (p=0.01). Taking an assessed 15% inter-assay imprecision into account, an optimized IgG ratio cut-off > 2.5 displayed a 100% specificity (95%CI: 99-100) and a 100% positive predictive value (95%CI: 96-100). A 0.8 cut-off displayed a 94% sensitivity (95%CI: 88-97) and a 97% negative predictive value (95%CI: 95-99). Substituting the upper threshold for the manufacturer's, improved assay performance, leaving 8.9% of IgG ratios indeterminate between 0.8-2.5. CONCLUSIONS: The Euroimmun assay displays a nearly optimal diagnostic accuracy using IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples, with no obvious gains from IgA serology. The optimized cut-offs are fit for rule-in and rule-out purposes, allowing determination of whether individuals in our study population have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or not.

More specifically, what determines the transmission mechanism of tax shocks at the state level? How vital are states' fiscal structures, financial conditions, labor market rigidities, and industry mix? Do these economic and structural characteristics drive the transmission mechanism of the tax changes at the state level at different horizons? This study employs a panel factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) technique to answer these issues. The findings show that state economies respond homogeneously in terms of employment and price levels; however, they react heterogeneously in real GDP and personal income growth. In most states, these reactions are statistically significant, and the heterogeneity in the effects of tax cuts is significantly related to the state's fiscal structure, manufacturing and financial composition, and the labor market's rigidity. A cross-state regression analysis shows that states with higher tax elasticity, higher personal income tax, strict labor market regulation, and economic policy uncertainties are relatively less responsive to federal tax changes. In contrast, the magnitude of the response in real GDP, personal income, and employment to tax cuts is relatively higher in states with a larger share of finance, manufacturing, lower tax burdens, and flexible credit markets.","Alam, Masud",,601,6

Approximately one-third of patients are candidates for systemic immunosuppressive treatments, such as synthetic or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, because of disease extensions, localization in sensitive or visible areas and/or resistance to topical treatments. These therapies have been associated with increased risk of infection, including upper respiratory tract viral infection. Psoriasis is frequently associated with cardio-metabolic comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes, that are risk factors for poor prognosis in the case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. A narrative review of the literature based on an electronic search of the PubMed® database was undertaken with the objective of investigating whether there is an increased risk of COVID-19 infection in psoriasis patients on systemic treatment. Original articles, such as case reports, published up to 1 November 2020 were included. There is no evidence that patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis receiving systemic treatments, including biologics, have higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or increased hospitalization and death related to COVID-19 compared to the general population. Several case reports described full recovery from COVID-19 with favorable outcomes in psoriasis patients who were being treated with synthetics or biologicals.

METHODS: Pseudo-monoenergetic CT images were obtained using the dual-energy mode on the Siemens Somatom Definition AS scanner. A range of PMR combinations (70-130 keV) were used with and without iMAR. A Virtual Water&#8482; phantom was used for quantitative assessment of error in the presence of high density materials: titanium, alloys 330 and 600. The absolute values of CT number differences (AD) and normalised standard deviations (NSD) were calculated for different phantom positions. Image quality was assessed using an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom with an embedded hip prosthesis. Image quality was scored blindly by five observers. RESULTS: AD and NSD values revealed differences in CT number errors between tested sets. AD and NSD were reduced in the vicinity of metal for images with iMAR (p < 0.001 for AD/NSD). For ROIs away from metal, with and without iMAR, 70 keV PMR and pCT AD values were lower than for the other reconstructions (p = 0.039). Similarly, iMAR NSD values measured away from metal were lower for 130 keV and 70 keV PMR (p = 0.002). Image quality scores were higher for 70 keV and 130 keV PMR with iMAR (p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: The use of 70 keV PMR with iMAR allows for significant metal artefact reduction and low CT number errors observed in the vicinity of dense materials. It is therefore an attractive alternative to high keV imaging when imaging patients with metallic implants, especially in the context of radiotherapy planning.","Pawalowski, Bartosz; Panek, Rafal; Szweda, Hubert; Piotrowski, Tomasz",Phys Med,601,30

In 2020, testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 was ramped up from none to over 10,000 weekly PCR tests per 100,000 population. The crude incidence data mirrored this increase in testing. Real-time access to denominator data and patient registries enabled adjustments for fluctuations testing activity, providing robust data on crude SARS-CoV-2 incidence during the changing diagnostic and management strategies. The use of the same data for different purposes, for example, final laboratory reports, information to the public, contact tracing, public health, and science, has been a critical asset for the pandemic response. It has also raised issues concerning data protection and critical capacity of the underlying technical systems and key resources. However, even with these limitations, the setup has enabled decision makers to adopt timely interventions. The experiences from COVID-19 may motivate a transformation from traditional indicator-based public health surveillance to an all-encompassing information system based on access to a comprehensive set of data sources, including diagnostic and reference microbiology.","Schønning, Kristian; Dessau, Ram Benny; Jensen, Thøger Gorm; Thorsen, Nicklas Myrthue; Wiuff, Camilla; Nielsen, Lene; Gubbels, Sophie; Denwood, Matt; Thygesen, Uffe Høgsbro; Christensen, Lasse Engbo; Møller, Camilla Holten; Møller, Jens Kjølseth; Ellermann-Eriksen, Svend; Østergaard, Christian; Lam, Janni Uyen Hoa; Abushalleeh, Nour; Meaidi, Marianna; Olsen, Stefan; Mølbak, Kåre; Voldstedlund, Marianne",APMIS acta pathol. microbiol. immunol. scand,601,17

TRIAL DESIGN: This is a single center, open label, randomized, controlled, parallel group, clinical trial that will be conducted at Loghman Hakim Medical Education Center in conjunction with Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty COVID-19 confirmed cases (using the RT-PCR test) will be enrolled in the trial between April 9th to April 14th 2020. Patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention groups or the control group with the following eligibility criteria: &#8805; 18 years of age AND (oxygen saturation (SPO2) &#8804; 93% OR respiratory rate &#8805; 24) AND at least one of the following: Contactless infrared forehead thermometer temperature of &#8805;37.8, cough, sputum production, nasal discharge, myalgia, headache or fatigue on admission, and time of onset of the symptoms should be acute (Days &#8804; 14). Although Hydroxychloroquine will be administered in a single dose, patients with heart problems (prolonged QT or PR intervals, second- or third-degree heart block, and arrhythmias including torsade de pointes) will be excluded. Other exclusion criteria include using drugs with potential interaction with Hydroxychloroquine + Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Interferon-ß 1a, Interferon-ß 1b, pregnant or lactating women, history of alcohol or drug addiction in the past 5 years, blood ALT/AST levels > 5 times the upper limit of normal on laboratory results and refusal to participate. This study will be undertaken at the Loghman Hakim Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: COVID-19 confirmed patients will be randomly assigned to one of three groups, with 20 patients in each. The first group (Arm 1) will receive Hydroxychloroquine + Lopinavir / Ritonavir (Kaletra) + Interferon-ß 1a (Recigen), the second group (Arm 2) will be administered Hydroxychloroquine + Lopinavir / Ritonavir (Kaletra) + Interferon-ß 1b (Ziferon), and the control group (Arm 3) will be treated by Hydroxychloroquine + Lopinavir / Ritonavir (Kaletra). MAIN OUTCOMES: Time to clinical improvement is our primary outcome measure. This is an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale (recommended by the World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) R&D. Geneva: World Health Organization) or discharge from the hospital, whichever comes first. Secondary outcomes include mortality from the date of randomization until the last day of the study which will be the day all of the patients have had at least one of the following outcomes: 1) Improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale. 2) Discharge from the hospital 3) Death. If any patient dies, we have reached an important secondary outcome. SpO2 Improvement between the last and first day of hospitalization, using pulse-oximetry. Duration of hospitalization from date of randomization until the date of hospital discharge or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first. Incidence of new mechanical ventilation uses from date of randomization until the last day of the study. Please note that we are trying to add further secondary outcomes and this section of the protocol is still evolving. Statistical analysis will be performed by R version 3.6.1 software. We will use Kaplan-Meier to analyze the time to clinical improvement (compared with a log-rank test). Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using the Cox proportional-hazards model in crude and adjusted analysis. RANDOMIZATION: Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either Interferon Beta 1a, Interferon Beta 1b or standard care only. Patients will be randomly allocated to three therapeutic arms using permuted, block-randomization to balance the number of patients allocated to each group. The permuted block (three or six patients per block) randomization sequence will be generated, using Package 'randomizeR' in R software version 3.6.1. and placed in individual sealed and opaque envelopes by the statistician. The investigator will enroll the patients and only then open envelopes to assign patients to the different treatment groups. This method of allocation concealment will result in minimum selection and confounding biases. BLINDING (MASKING): The present research is open-label (no masking) of patients and health care professionals who are undertaking outcome assessment of the primary outcome - time to clinical improvement. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): Of the 60 patients who underwent randomization, 20 patients were assigned to receive Interferon beta-1a, 20 patients were assigned to receive Interferon beta 1b plus standard care and the rest of patients were assigned to receive the standard care alone. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 1.2.1. Recruitment is finished, the start date of recruitment was on 9th April 2020 and the end date was on 14th April 2020. Last point of data collection will be the last day on which all of the 60 participants have had an outcome of clinical improvement or death, completing the study's follow-up time window. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered with National Institutes of Health Clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov; identification number NCT04343768, registered April 8, 2020 and first available online April 13, 2020).

Environmental changes, disrupted routines, and reduced access to services and social networks will have a unique impact on autistic individuals and their families and will contribute to significant deterioration in some. Access to support is crucial to address vulnerability factors, guide adjustments in home environments, and apply mitigation strategies to improve coping. The current crisis highlights that our regular care systems are not sufficient to meet the needs of the autism communities. In many parts of the world, people have shifted to online school and increased use of remote delivery of healthcare and autism supports. Access to these services needs to be increased to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 and future epidemics/pandemics. The rapid expansion in the use of telehealth platforms can have a positive impact on both care and research. It can help to address key priorities for the autism communities including long waitlists for assessment and care, access to services in remote locations, and restricted hours of service. However, system-level changes are urgently needed to ensure equitable access and flexible care models, especially for families and individuals who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. COVID-19 mandates the use of technology to support a broader range of care options and better meet the diverse needs of autistic people and their families. It behooves us to use this crisis as an opportunity to foster resilience not only for a given individual or their family, but also the system: to drive enduring and autism-friendly changes in healthcare, social systems, and the broader socio-ecological contexts.","Ameis, Stephanie H; Lai, Meng-Chuan; Mulsant, Benoit H; Szatmari, Peter",Mol Autism,601,16

Like much about COVID, this so-called Long COVID is perplexing. It is associated with numerous symptoms. foremost among them profound fatigue, and often occurs in a relapsing/remitting pattern. There is one ""living"" guideline for managing Long COVID and even terminology and definitions of the syndrome are in flux. Long COVID occurs inpatients who have recovered from the acute infection and this may be viral persistence, a form of autoimmunity, or the long-term results of organ damage sustained during the acute infection. Symptoms have been reported up to six months after acute infection with no clear association between the severity of the acute infection and the presence or absence of Long COVID. The symptoms of the acute illness do not necessarily align with the symptoms of Long COVID. Disruptions to the autonomic function in Long COVID are particularly puzzling, including orthostatic intolerance syndrome (which may not have occurred during the acute infection). Loss of the sense of smell and taste is one symptom that appears common in both acute and Long COVID;on the other hand, fever is more prevalent in acute than Long COVID.

We find that frequencies of air flights and high-speed train (HST) services out of Wuhan are significantly associated with the number of COVID-19 cases in the destination cities. The presence of an airport or HST station at a city is significantly related to the speed of the pandemic spread, but its link with the total number of confirmed cases is weak. The farther the distance from Wuhan, the lower number of cases in a city and the slower the dissemination of the pandemic. The longitude and latitude coordinates do not have a significant relationship with the number of total cases but can increase the speed of the COVID-19 spread. Specifically, cities in the higher longitudinal region tended to record a COVID-19 case earlier than their counterparties in the west. Cities in the north were more likely to report the first case later than those in the south. The pandemic may emerge in large cities earlier than in small cities as GDP is a factor positively associated with the spread speed.","Zhang, Yahua; Zhang, Anming; Wang, Jiaoe",Transp Policy (Oxf),601,24

We tested the hypothesis that lowering a load involves different shoulder muscle coordination strategies compared to lifting a load. METHODS: EMG activity of 13 muscles was recorded in 30 healthy volunteers who lifted and lowered a 6, 12 or 18 kg box between three shelves. Kinematics, EMG levels and muscle synergies, extracted using non-negative matrix factorization, were analyzed. RESULTS: We found greater muscle activity level during lowering in four muscles (+ 1-2% MVC in anterior deltoid, biceps brachii, serratus anterior and pectoralis major). The movements were performed faster during lifting (18.2 vs. 15.9 cm/s) but with similar hand paths and segment kinematics. The number of synergies was the same in both tasks. Two synergies were identified in ~ 75% of subjects, and one synergy in the others. Synergy #1 mainly activated prime movers' muscles, while synergy #2 co-activated several antagonist muscles. Synergies' structure was similar between lifting and lowering (Pearson's r &#8776; 0.9 for synergy #1 and 0.7-08 for synergy #2). Synergy #2 was more activated during lowering and explained the greater activity observed in anterior deltoid, serratus anterior and pectoralis. CONCLUSION: Lifting and lowering a load were associated with similar synergy structure. In 3/4 of subjects, lowering movements involved greater activation of a ""multiple antagonists"" synergy. The other subjects co-contracted all shoulder muscles as a unit in both conditions. These inter-individual differences should be investigated in the occurrence of shoulder musculoskeletal disorders.","Turpin, Nicolas A; Martinez, Romain; Begon, Mickael",Eur. j. appl. physiol,601,16

With their mobility severely constrained, most citizen scientists in South Africa were not able to submit full protocol lists during the Alert Level 5 lockdown. There was a 70% decline in full protocol list submissions in April 2020, and only 20% of the number of pentads was surveyed, compared with the same period in the previous three years. The decline in ad hoc lists is also evident, with about a 50% decline in the number of lists submitted and 25% of the usual number of pentads. The number of citizen scientists submitting ad hoc lists only declined by about 15% in April, compared with previous years, indicating that volunteers were still eager to contribute to the atlas project, despite the challenging conditions. The BirdLasser ‘Lockdown Challenge’ further encouraged participation. Although the ability of citizen scientists to contribute full protocol lists to SABAP2 may have suffered, other projects with a scope more suited to lockdown thrived. The ‘Lockdown Garden Surveys’ instigated as part of a study of urban bird communities proved extremely successful, with 283 people regularly contributing point counts, many on a daily basis. The overwhelmingly positive response to initiatives like these indicates that the lockdown may have actually increased people’s desire to participate in citizen science.

Due to the lack of annotated samples, these studies recommend transfer learning and explore the choices of pre-trained models and data augmentation. However, it is still unknown if there are better strategies than vanilla transfer learning for more accurate COVID-19 classification with limited CT data. This paper provides an affirmative answer, devising a novel `model' augmentation technique that allows a considerable performance boost to transfer learning for the task. Our method systematically reduces the distributional shift between the source and target domains and considers augmenting deep learning with complementary representation learning techniques. We establish the efficacy of our method with publicly available datasets and models, along with identifying contrasting observations in the previous studies.","Altaf, Fouzia; Islam, Syed M.S.; Janjua, Naeem K.; Akhtar, Naveed",,601,16

This study examined the potentially unique and synergistic roles of individual differences in neurocognition and health literacy in the early uptake and use of COVID-19 public health information.Method: Data were collected between April 23 and 21 May 2020, a period during which 42 out of 50 states were under a stay-at-home order. Participants were 217 healthy adults who completed a telephone-based battery that included standard tests of neurocognition, health literacy, verbal IQ, personality, and anxiety. Participants also completed measures of COVID-19 information-seeking skills, knowledge, prevention intentions, and prevention behaviors.Results: A series of hierarchical multiple regressions with data-driven covariates showed that neurocognition (viz, episodic verbal memory and executive functions) was independently related to COVID-19 knowledge (e.g. symptoms, risks) at a medium effect size, but not to information-seeking skills, prevention intentions, or prevention behaviors. Health literacy was independently related to all measured aspects of COVID-19 health information and did not interact with neurocognition in any COVID-19 health domain.Conclusions: Individual differences in neurocognition and health literacy played independent and meaningful roles in the initial acquisition of knowledge related to COVID-19, which is a novel human health condition. Future studies might examine whether neurocognitive supports (e.g. spaced retrieval practice, elaboration) can improve COVID-19-related knowledge and health behaviors in vulnerable populations.","Babicz, Michelle A; Woods, Steven Paul; Matchanova, Anastasia; Medina, Luis D; Podell, Kenneth; Walker, Rheeda L; Fetterman, Adam; Rahman, Samina; Johnson, Briana; Thompson, Jennifer L; Sullivan, Kelli L; Beltran-Najera, Ilex; Brooks, Jasmin; Morales, Yenifer; Avci, Gunes",J Clin Exp Neuropsychol,601,18

However, the utility of medical chart writing simulations as a component of the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) has not been sufficiently evaluated. In this study, medical chart documentation in several clinical simulation settings was performed as part of the OSCE, and its correlation with CC performance was evaluated. METHODS: We created a clinical situation video and images involving the acquisition of informed consent, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and diagnostic imaging in the emergency department, and assessed medical chart documentation performance by medical students as part of the OSCE. Evaluations were conducted utilizing original checklist (0-10 point). We also analyzed the correlation between medical chart documentation OSCE scores and CC performance of 120 medical students who performed their CC in 2019 as 5th year students and took the Post-CC OSCE in 2020 as 6th year students. RESULTS: Of the OSCE components, scores for the acquisition of informed consent and resuscitation showed significant correlations with CC performance (P<0.001 for each). In contrast, scores for diagnostic imaging showed a slightly positive, but non-significant, correlation with CC performance (P = 0.107). Overall scores for OSCE showed a significant correlation with CC performance (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: We conducted a correlation analysis of CC performance and the quality of medical chart documentation in a simulation setting.

While patients with COVID-19 most frequently present with pneumonia, respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, increasing cases of immune-mediated disorders such as autoimmune thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia and antiphospholipid syndrome have been reported. In this article we describe a rare case of cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS) in a patient with COVID-19. The patient was a 77-year-old man with a history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency who presented with COVID-19 infection and acute respiratory failure. Initially he was started on intravenous steroids, antibiotics and hydroxychloroquine. Laboratory analysis revealed haemolytic anaemia with a positive direct anti-globulin test (DAT) and high titres of cold agglutinins. Hydroxychloroquine was stopped due to suspicion of haemolysis due to G6PD deficiency but the haemolysis persisted. Unfortunately, the respiratory failure progressed and the patient died. In summary, this article describes a rare case of CAS associated with COVID-19. CAS is a heterogenous group of cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemias occurring secondary to infections or malignancies. No definite treatment for CAS in COVID-19 patients has been approved so far.

The increase in population-weighted exposure was mainly driven by a nationwide urban-to-rural population migration before the Spring Festival coupled with the freezing of the migration backward due to the quarantine, which increased household energy consumption and the fraction of people exposed to rural household air pollution indoors.

In the infected animals, viral variants arose that harbored mutations in the spike (S) protein, the target of neutralizing antibodies, and these variants were transmitted back to humans. This raised concerns that mink might become a constant source of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with an increased threat to human health and resulted in mass culling of mink. Here, we report that mutations frequently found in the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 from mink are mostly compatible with efficient entry into human cells and its inhibition by soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In contrast, mutation Y453F reduces neutralization by an antibody with emergency use authorization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapy and sera/plasma from COVID-19 patients. These results suggest that antibody responses induced upon infection or certain antibodies used for treatment might offer insufficient protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants from mink.","Hoffmann, Markus; Zhang, Lu; Krüger, Nadine; Graichen, Luise; Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Kempf, Amy; Nessler, Stefan; Riggert, Joachim; Winkler, Martin Sebastian; Schulz, Sebastian; Jäck, Hans-Martin; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Cell Rep,601,24

With advances in omics technology of eye disorders, genome-scale datasets have been rapidly accumulated in genetics and epigenetics field. However, the efficient collection and comprehensive analysis of different kinds of omics data are lacking. Herein, we developed EyeDiseases (https://eyediseases.bio-data.cn/), the first database for multi-omics data integration and interpretation of human eyes diseases. It contains 1344 disease-associated genes with genetic variation, 1774 transcription files of bulk cell expression and single-cell RNA-seq, 105 epigenomics data across 185 kinds of human eye diseases. Using EyeDiseases, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 potential tropism in eye infection and found that the SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly correlated with cornea and keratoconus, suggest that ocular surface cells are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, integrating analysis of Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) GWAS loci and co-expression data revealed 9 associated genes involved in HIF-1 signaling pathway and voltage-gate potassium channel complex. The EyeDiseases provides a valuable resource for accelerating the discovery and validation of candidate loci and genes contributed to the molecular diagnosis and therapeutic vulnerabilities with various eyes diseases.","Yuan, J.; Chen, F.; Fan, D.; Jiang, Q.; Xue, Z.; Zhang, J.; Yu, X.; Li, K.; Qu, J.; Su, J.",Nar Genomics &amp; Bioinformatics,601,10

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the number of social activities on the relationship between walking habits and disability incidence in older adults. We included 2873 older adults (mean age, 73.1 years;SD, ±5.9 years) from the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology—Study of Geriatric Syndromes. Baseline measurements, including frequencies of physical and social activities, health conditions, physical function, cognitive function, metabolic parameters, and other potential disability risk factors (for example, the number of years of education);monthly assessment for disability was monitored through long-term care insurance certification for at least 2 years from baseline. During a mean follow-up of 35.1 months (SD, 6.4 months), 133 participants developed disability. The disability incidence was 19.0 and 27.9 per 1000 person-years for participants who walked more (≥3 times per week) and less (≤3 times per week) frequently, respectively. The potential confounding factor-adjusted disability hazard ratio was 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.96;p = 0.030). The relationship between habitual walking and the number of social activities was statistically significant (p = 0.004). The reduction of disability risk by walking was greater among participants with fewer social activities. Habitual walking was associated with disability incidence, with a more pronounced effect among older adults who were less likely to engage in social activities.","Katayama, Osamu Lee Sangyoon Bae Seongryu Makino Keitaro Chiba Ippei Harada Kenji Shinkai Yohei Shimada Hiroyuki",Journal of Clinical Medicine,601,33

Subunit vaccines can avoid potential toxicity associated with traditional whole virion-inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines; however, the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines is often poor. A facile method is here reported to produce lipid nanoparticle subunit vaccines that exhibit high immunogenicity and elicit protection against influenza virus. Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) immunogens are functionalized on the surface of liposomes via stable metal chelation chemistry, using a scalable advanced microfluidic mixing technology (NanoAssemblr). Immunization of mice with HA-liposomes elicits increased serum antibody titers and superior protection against highly pathogenic virus challenge compared with free HA protein. HA-liposomal vaccines display enhanced antigen deposition into germinal centers within the draining lymph nodes, driving increased HA-specific B cell, and follicular helper T cell responses. This work provides mechanistic insights into highly protective HA-liposome vaccines and informs the rational design and rapid production of next generation nanoparticle subunit vaccines.","Vu, Mai N; Kelly, Hannah G; Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Juno, Jennifer A; Esterbauer, Robyn; Davis, Thomas P; Truong, Nghia P; Wheatley, Adam K; Kent, Stephen J",Adv Healthc Mater,601,21

However, extremity ischemia with acrocyanosis and digital gangrene has not been commonly reported with COVID-19.

While common in developing nations, it is unusual in the United Kingdom. We present the first United Kingdom case series and discuss its potential role during and after this pandemic. Methods We prospectively studied patients with appendicitis at a British district general hospital who were unsuitable for conservative management and consequently underwent open appendicectomy under SA. We also reviewed patient satisfaction after 30 days. This ran for 5 weeks from March 25th, 2020 until the surgical department reverted to the laparoscopic appendicectomy as the standard of care. Main outcomes were 30-day complication rates and patient satisfaction. Results None of the included seven patients were COVID positive. The majority (four-sevenths) had complicated appendicitis. There were no major adverse (Clavien-Dindo grade III to V) postoperative events. Two patients suffered minor postoperative complications. Two experienced intraoperative pain. Mean operative time was 44 minutes. Median length of stay and return to activity was 1 and 14 days, respectively. Although four stated preference in hindsight for GA, the majority (five-sevenths) were satisfied with the operative experience under SA. Discussion Although contraindications, risk of pain, and specific complications may be limiting, our series demonstrates open appendicectomy under SA to be safe and feasible in the United Kingdom. The technique could be a valuable contingency for COVID-suspected cases and patients with high-risk respiratory disease.","Mai, D. V. C.; Sagar, A.; Claydon, O.; Park, J. Y.; Tapuria, N.; Keeler, B.

The aim of this paper is to present a case report of an COVID-19 patient with severe hypocalcaemia. This is a report of an 81-year-old female, suffered from myalgia and fatigue for more than 3-4 weeks. Fever and cough appear 2 days before she presented to the emergency room. On physical examination, she was febrile with a temperature of 38.8°C, accompanied by cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, and muscle ache. Her past medical history was remarkable with no chronic disease. She had lymphopenia. Laboratory test revealed moderate liver dysfunction, hypoalbuminemia, and severe hypocalcaemia (serum corrected calcium level: 5.7 mg/dL). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) was 107.9 pg/mL (range: 15-65) and 25(OH)2D levels was 4.5 ng/mL (range: 25-80). Chest CT scan detected peripheral ground-glass opacity.

She was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, third generation cephalosporin, anticoagulant, daily high-dose calcium acetate, vitamin D3, fresh frozen plasma and oxygen therapy. She was discharged after two negative throat swab tests for coronavirus by conventional RT-PCR. Learning points: Comorbidities are a risk factor for patients with COVID-19. Laboratory findings are unspecific in COVID-19 patients; laboratory abnormalities include lymphopenia, elevated of LDH, CPK and the inflammatory markers, such as C reactive protein, ferritinemia and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In addition to inflammatory markers, in COVID-19 patients it is crucial to check the level of vitamin D and calcium.

The recent Ebola, Zika and COVID-19 outbreaks demonstrate the devastating human, social and economic impacts of such diseases if they are not prevented or controlled, ideally at source. The risk drivers for zoonoses, which are complex and often interdependent, include climate change and related disasters, antimicrobial resistance, and anthropogenic drivers such as land-use changes and animal production practices. Understanding these drivers requires a better understanding of the ecology of zoonotic diseases at the human-animal-environment interface. Biosecurity and biosafety are critical for reducing the risk of accidental or deliberate release and should be included in risk management strategies. International frameworks for sustainable development, climate change, and disaster risk reduction have all integrated health as one of the core areas of work, calling for better preparedness and response to biological hazards and increased health system resilience.

Regarding the severity of COVID-19, six (25%) patients had moderate COVID-19 and 18 (75%) had severe COVID-19. Out of 24 patients, six survived and 18 died, the mortality being 75%. The most common cause of death was sepsis with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in 10 (42.6 %) patients followed by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and neurological cause in four (16.6 %) patients each. When survivors were compared with non-survivors, advanced age and presence of altered sensorium were more in non-survivors. Conclusion Severe COVID-19 and advanced malignancy is a sinister combination that has high mortality. These patients require close monitoring and aggressive care. Presence of altered sensorium and advanced age predicts poorer outcome.","Kumar, Rakesh; Patel, Nishant; Kodan, Parul; Aggarwal, Richa; Dass, Christopher; Soni, Kapil Dev; Trikha, Anjan",Cureus,601,20

Experimentally infected camelids clear infectious virus within one week and mount an effective adaptive immune response. Here, transcription of immune response genes was monitored in the respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected alpacas. Concomitant to the peak of infection, occurring at 2 days post inoculation (dpi), type I and III interferons (IFNs) were maximally transcribed only in the nasal mucosa of alpacas, while interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) were induced along the whole respiratory tract. Simultaneous to mild focal infiltration of leukocytes in nasal mucosa and submucosa, upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 and dampened transcription of pro-inflammatory genes under NF-κB control were observed. In the lung, early (1 dpi) transcription of chemokines (CCL2 and CCL3) correlated with a transient accumulation of mainly mononuclear leukocytes. A tight regulation of IFNs in lungs with expression of ISGs and controlled inflammatory responses, might contribute to virus clearance without causing tissue damage. Thus, the nasal mucosa, the main target of MERS-CoV in camelids, seems central in driving an efficient innate immune response based on triggering ISGs as well as the dual anti-inflammatory effects of type III IFNs and IL10.","Te, Nigeer; Rodon, Jordi; Ballester, Maria; Pérez, Mónica; Pailler-García, Lola; Segalés, Joaquim; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Bensaid, Albert",PLoS Pathog,601,8

Senescent T cells are highly inflammatory and secrete cytotoxic mediators and express natural killer cells receptors (NKR) that bypass their antigen specificity. Instead they recognize stress ligands that are induced by inflammation or infection of different cell types in tissues. In this article we discuss data on T cell senescence, how it is regulated and evidence for novel functional attributes of senescent T cells. We discuss an interactive loop between senescent T cells and senescent non‐lymphoid cells and conclude that in situations of intense inflammation, senescent cells may damage healthy tissue. While the example for immunopathology induced by senescent cells that we highlight is cutaneous leishmaniasis, this situation of organ damage may apply to other infections, including COVID‐19 and also rheumatoid arthritis, where ageing, inflammation and senescent cells are all part of the same equation.","Covre, Luciana P.; De Maeyer, Roel P.

A broad spectrum of information technology tools and applications played an essential role to create awareness of the COVID-19 vaccination drive and its health benefits. Research conducted by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in collaboration with information technology platforms like Facebook with inputs from World Health Organization (WHO), John Hopkins University (JHU), and Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) shows that 65.06% of people all over the globe are willing to get vaccinated. Vaccine acceptance depends upon social norms and human behavior. These organizations conducted the global survey in over 60 countries with a sample size of 437,236 responses. The international survey was organized using a pre-registered randomized experiment demonstrating the role of technology in reaching out to people based in diverse communities and evaluating their beliefs, behavior, and social norms. The study shows that vaccine acceptance can vary due to descriptive norms. All the respondents in the study were adults with access to the internet. Moreover, a large proportion of the population thinks that the COVID-19 pandemic is a viable threat to the community and preventive measures need to be taken including vaccination drives to eradicate the menace. The survey consisted of five blocks involving questions related to healthcare, demographics, vaccines, knowledge, and information exposure.

While the importance of traditional in silico approaches such as QSAR in such efforts in unquestionable, these models fundamentally rely on structural similarity to infer biological activity and are thus prone to becoming trapped in the very nearby chemical spaces of already known ligands. For novel and unprecedented threats such as COVID-19 much faster and efficient paradigms must be devised to accelerate the identification of new chemical classes for rapid drug development. Here we report the development of a new biological activity-based modeling (BABM) approach that builds on the hypothesis that compounds with similar activity patterns tend to share similar targets or mechanisms of action. In BABM, compound activity profiles established on massive scale across multiple assays are used as signatures to predict compound activity in a new assay or against a new target. We first trained and validated this approach by identifying new antiviral lead candidates for Zika and Ebola based on data from ~0.5 million compounds screened against ~2,000 assays. BABM models were then applied to predict ~300 compounds not previously reported to have activity for SARS-CoV-2, which were then tested in a live virus assay with high (>30%) hit rates. The most potent compounds showed antiviral activities in the nanomolar range. These potent confirmed compounds have the potential to be further developed in novel chemical space into new anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies. These results demonstrate unprecedented ability using BABM to predict novel structures as chemical leads significantly beyond traditional methods, and its application in rapid drug discovery response in a global public health crisis.","Huang, Ruili; Xu, Miao; Zhu, Hu; Chen, Catherine Z.; Lee, Emily M.; He, Shihua; Shamim, Khalida; Bougie, Danielle; Huang, Wenwei; Hall, Mathew D.; Lo, Donald; Simeonov, Anton; Austin, Christopher P.; Qiu, Xiangguo; Tang, Hengli; Zheng, Wei",bioRxiv,601,18

Materials and Methods: IRB approval was obtained. Cross-sectional anonymous surveys of patients were collected from a single academic fertility center. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive a one-page graphic of supplemental education providing basic facts and benefits regarding COVID-19 vaccination based on the ASRM COVID-19 taskforce recommendations. Beliefs related to COVID-19 vaccination was assessed with dichotomous, Likert scale and multiple-choice questions. Assessment of trust in the medical system was conducted via the Medical Mistrust Index (MMI). Descriptive data and chi-square analysis were used to compare responses between the intervention v. no intervention groups. Results: To date, 1130/3595 surveys have been received, response rate = 31.4%. Except for age (35.87, SD=4.0 vs 35.68, SD=4.187 p<.05), both the intervention and non-intervention groups were similar in term of demographics, including education and race;participants were predominantly white (77.8%), married (89.2%), and nulliparous (68.6%). 30.3% reported that a loved one or themselves (7.5%) tested positive for COVID-19, 46.7% knew someone who had been hospitalized or who died of COVID-19, and 6.8% stated they would not get the vaccine. Most participants (54.8%) strongly disagreed or disagreed that the vaccine could affect future fertility. Among the participants who reported their vaccination status (N=790), 25.3% of the study population received one dose, 61.4% completed vaccination while 11% did not plan on getting vaccinated. Compared to those who intended to receive the vaccine, 97.9% v. 70.4% believed that the COVID-19 vaccine given during pregnancy does not cause genetic abnormalities in a fetus or infertility (98.8% v. 81.5%), that a more severe infection has been associated with pregnancy (81.3% v. 74.6%) and strongly disagreed (32.7% v. 1.7%) or disagreed (29.0% v. 1.7%) on having concerns on its impact on future pregnancies (p<.05). Similar patterns were seen with those with higher scores on the MMI and beliefs that the vaccines can cause harm. Participants in the intervention group were more likely to believe that COVID-19 vaccination does not cause genetic abnormalities in a fetus (98.0% v. 94.2%), does not cause infertility (99% v. 96.2%) and that a more severe infection has been associated with pregnancy (81.3% v. 74.6%) (all p <.05). Higher scores on the MMI but not the intervention was associated with vaccine hesitancy (p=.01). Conclusions: The majority of women in this study had received or planned to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Participants with greater trust in the medical system were more likely to receive the vaccine. The intervention increased patient’s knowledge regarding the vaccine and most patients did not believe that COVID-19 vaccination negatively impacts infertility. Impact Statement: Vaccine hesitancy was associated with mistrust of the medical system.

The gold-standard in estimating a causal effect are randomized experiments. As these are neither feasible nor ethical in estimating mobility's impact on Dengue, we rely on methods that make use of observational data. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the world saw a sudden drop in long- and short-distance travel. In March 2020, inner- and inter-city transit dropped severely and uniformly across cities in Brazil. The drop was random (in time) and is not linked to any of the other factors that affect Dengue, such as the mosquito population size. This gives rise to a quasi-experimental situation to assess the impact of mobility reduction on Dengue Fever in Brazilian cities. The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Dengue Fever has been recognized globally [2, 3] and first attempts at estimating this impact have been published. Conceição et al. (2021) [4] find an association between social isolation and Dengue in the Brazilian state of São Paulo using a negative binomial regression model. Risk of Dengue infection in São Paulo decreases by 9% twenty days after isolation, defined as mobility reduction of 1-30% relative to baseline mobility prior to the pandemic. Lim et al. (2020) [5] use a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to estimate the causal effect of social distancing policies on Dengue at the state-level in three South-East Asian countries. Results for Thailand indicate that social distancing raises Dengue incidence by 0.431 cases per 10,000 people. The authors explain this effect by referring to the increased time spent at home, where the risk of infection is higher than in other locations, such as workplaces. No significant effect was found for Singapore and Malaysia. Figure 1 shows the time series of Dengue cases in cities in São Paulo over time. The top panel compares the evolution during the pandemic year 2020 with the average of prior distributions. We note that early 2020 saw greater incidence and an earlier peak than in prior years. This could be due to the stark mobility reduction that occurred in March (epidemiological weeks 11-13). However, the evolution of Dengue cases from 2020 is not unprecedented, as can be seen in the lower panel. Here we compare the time series in individual years and note that 2020 had a similar distribution as the year 2016. The peak in these years occurred earlier than in the years 2015 and 2019. In the following analysis, we aim to better understand the possible causal impact of mobility reduction on Dengue. METHODS: We implement propensity score matching to assess the causal effect of mobility on Dengue during the COVID-19 pandemic in São Paulo state in Brazil. We match weeks during the peak pandemic period (March-June 2020) to comparable previous periods based instruments for the mosquito population size and human susceptibility to Dengue. The breeding conditions and thus mosquito population size is approximated using climate factors. We estimate the level of susceptibility within the human population by taking the average number of infections in the same month of the past three years, so as to approximate the duration of partial immunity after Dengue infection. By matching within a given city, we also control for city-level characteristics that may affect Dengue, such as landscape and environment factors, socio-economic situation, or population density. We use weekly data on Dengue cases and climate (rainfall, temperature, humidity) in 37 cities in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, from 2015 until 2020. The peak isolation period (March - June 2020) was determined using monthly traffic volume at toll stations, where isolation is the period in which passenger traffic was consistently below the pre-pandemic (2011-2019) minimum. We also leverage the regional COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports published by Google to assess the change in mobility due to the pandemic. We compute the propensity score using both a logistic regression model and a 100-tree Random Forest model with five-fold cross-validation. In both cases, we observe good overlap in the propensity scores among treated and control groups, suggesting that conditions for matching are met (see figure 2). We implement both one-to-one and one-to-many matching with calipers. After matching, we observe similar distributions of the control variables among the treated and matched control periods. Figure 3 illustrates this using the distributions of the one-to-one matching based on propensity scores of the logistic regression models. RESULTS: We compare the Sample Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (SATT) across the four models and find variation in the direction of the causal effect. In 12 cities, mobility reductions are linked to more Dengue cases with results being robust to the propensity score estimation method and matching type. Fewer Dengue cases are reported in 9 cities during the pandemic, regardless of which model is chosen. The remaining cities are sensitive to the model chosen: in 6 cases, three of the four models produced a positive effect, while the majority indicated lower Dengue incidence in 5 cities. The diversity of results may be attributed to differing travel patterns across cities. Long-distance travel hubs like São Paulo (the state capital) and São Carlos (university city with flux of students across the country) demonstrate a negative relationship of a SATT of -18.0 and -18.8 cases per week, respectively. Cities that experience mostly local travel demonstrate the converse effect. This role of different mobility types should be explored further. Additional robustness checks should be performed to understand the role of additional control variables or varying time series length. CONCLUSIONS: The SATT of mobility on Dengue varies across the cities in our sample, with more cities experiencing an increase in cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. KEY MESSAGES: The travel reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic enables a quasi-experimental analysis of mobility on Dengue. Our results suggest that there is a a causal effect of mobility on Dengue that varies across cities in São Paulo state. Specific characteristics of cities may help explain where mobility leads to Dengue spreading and where home-based infections are the primary disease drivers.","Roster, Kirstin; Connaughton, Colm; Rodrigues, Francisco A",Int J Epidemiol,601,20

The purpose of this study is to compare sulodexide and its components with unfractionated heparin (UFH) to determine its suitability for the indications in which UFH is used. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) versions of sulodexide, FMH and DS were obtained from Alfasigma. API versions of UFH were obtained from Medefil Inc. Normal human citrated plasma was obtained from blood bank of the Loyola University Medical Center. Each of the individual agents were supplemented in plasma at a graded concentration of 0.0-10 µg/mL. Clotting assays (PiCT, aPTT, PT and TT), anti-Xa and anti-IIa and thrombin generation studies were carried out. Results were compiled as mean ± SD of 3 individual determination. RESULT: In the clot based (PiCT, aPTT and TT), anti-Xa and IIa assays, both the UFH and FMH produced stronger activities in these assays followed by sulodexide. DS did not show any anticoagulant activity. In the thrombin generation assay, FMH and UFH produced comparable inhibition of thrombin generation as measured by various parameters. Sulodexide was slightly weaker in this assay, whereas DS produced relatively weaker effects. CONCLUSION: In comparison to sulodexide, both UFH and FMH exhibit comparable anticoagulant activity despite differences in their molecular weight. These results suggest that sulodexide can be developed as a parenteral anticoagulant for indications in which UFH is used.","Siddiqui, Fakiha; Hoppensteadt, Debra; Bontekoe, Emily; Farooqui, Ambar; Jeske, Walter; Fareed, Jawed",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,601,28

This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students’ mental health and sleep in Saudi Arabia. Method: A total of 582 undergraduate students from Saudi Arabia aged between 18 and 45 years old (M = 20.91, SD = 3.17) completed a cross-sectional online questionnaire measuring depression, anxiety, stress, resilience, and insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020). Analysis included an independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, and Hierarchical regression analysis. Results: Undergraduate students reported high levels of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress and low levels of resilience (p < 0.001) during the pandemic. In addition, students reported experiencing insomnia. A hierarchical regression analysis indicated that lower resilience, high levels of insomnia, having a pre-existing mental health condition, and learning difficulties (such as dyslexia, dyspraxia, or dyscalculia) were significantly associated with high levels of depression and stress. In addition, lower resilience, a high level of insomnia, and pre-existing mental health conditions were significantly associated with high levels of anxiety. Finally, a lower level of psychological resilience and a high level of insomnia were significantly associated with increased levels of depression, anxiety and stress within university students. Conclusion: This study has provided evidence that a lower level of psychological resilience and insomnia were associated with mental health problems among undergraduate students in Saudi Arabia, thus enhancing psychological resilience and interventions to support sleep and mental health are vital to support student well-being outcomes throughout the pandemic.","Alyoubi, Azizah; Halstead, Elizabeth J.; Zambelli, Zoe; Dimitriou, Dagmara",Int J Environ Res Public Health,601,26

The patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 may develop a pro-thrombotic state with a much higher frequency, thus we decided to investigate the role of Spike protein (the only common product of the two conditions) or the anti-Spike antibodies in the etiopathogenesis of thrombosis. A pathogenic Platelet Factor 4 (PF4)-dependent syndrome, unrelated to the use of heparin therapy, has been reported after the administration of vaccines in the patients manifesting acute thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. Thus, we aimed at shedding light on the structural similarities of Spike of SARS-CoV-2 and PF4 on their eventual biochemical interactions and on the role of their specific antibodies. The similarities between PF4 and Spike-RBD proteins were evaluated by a comparison of the structures and by testing the cross-reactivity of their specific antibodies by ELISA assays. We found that the anti-Spike antibodies do not recognize PF4, on the contrary, the anti-PF4 antibodies show some cross-reactivity for Spike-RBD. More interestingly, we report for the first time that the PF4 and Spike-RBD proteins can bind each other. These data suggest that the interaction of the two proteins could be involved in the generation of anti-PF4 antibodies, their binding to Spike-RBD, which could lead to platelets aggregation due also to their high expression of ACE2.","Passariello, Margherita; Vetrei, Cinzia; Amato, Felice; De Lorenzo, Claudia",Int J Mol Sci,601,20

A total of 310 dog owners completed a questionnaire based on our model. We employed structural equation modeling to verify the structural relationships and found three main results. First, our model was fit, and each path was significant. People with better attitudes, stronger subjective norms, and more perceptive behavioral control have stronger behavioral intention. Second, perceived behavioral control, not attitude, was the best predictive index in this model. Finally, on perceived behavioral control, subjective knowledge showed more influence than objective knowledge. We successfully extended TPB to explain the behavioral intention of dog owners and presented more workable recommendations. To reduce the latent social risk of disease, the government should not only address dog owners’ attitudes, but also their subjective norms and perceptive behavioral control. Indeed, perceptive behavioral control and SK showed the most influence in this model. It is implied that the self-efficacy of dog owners is the most important factor in such a behavior. Therefore, the government should focus on enhancing dog owners’ self-efficacy first while devoted to prevention activities.","Ku-Yuan, Lee; Li-Chi, Lan; Jiun-Hao, Wang; Chen-Ling, Fang; Kun-Sun, Shiao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,601,26

However, ‘over-sharpening’ due to the application of a single global B-factor can distort processed maps causing connected densities to appear broken and disconnected. This issue limits the interpretability of cryo-EM maps, i.e. ab initio modelling. In this work, we propose 1) approaches to enhance high-resolution features of cryo-EM maps, while preventing map distortions and 2) methods to obtain local B-factors and electron density occupancy maps. These algorithms have as common link the use of the spiral phase transformation and are called LocSpiral, LocBSharpen, LocBFactor and LocOccupancy. Our results, which include improved maps of recent SARS-CoV-2 structures, show that our methods can improve the interpretability and analysis of obtained reconstructions.","Kaur, Satinder; Gomez-Blanco, Josue; Khalifa, Ahmad A.

Specifically, the data relating to the four Italian regions most affected by the effects of the new coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), namely Lombardia, Veneto, Emilia Romagna and Piemonte, were assessed. In this work, we decided to focus the analysis only on data relating to patients admitted to the intensive care unit and to patients who died in Italy with COVID-19 in the period 24 February–4 May 2020. We used a data set where each point was an expression not of a single day, but of a longer period of time (date-points method).

We aim to identify the prevalence and nuances of reported burnout in general surgery resident physicians to better understand which factors contribute the greatest risk. METHODS: A 42-question anonymous online survey was distributed by the Association of Program Directors in Surgery (APDS) to general surgery resident physicians. ANOVA, chi-square and multinomial regression analyses were performed with significance defined as p < 0.05. This survey was reported in line with the STOCSS criteria. RESULTS: 81 survey responses were received. Burnout was reported by 89.5% of university-hospital affiliated respondents and 95.2% of community teaching hospital affiliated respondents. After adjustment, community respondents showed a nearly fifteen times greater likelihood of burnout (aOR = 14.735, 95% CI: 0.791,274.482). Females were 2.7 times as likely as males to report burnout (aOR = 2.749, 95% CI: 0.189,39.960) and nearly twice as likely to report contemplating suicide (aOR = 1.819, 95% CI: 0.380,8.715). Burnout rates by hours worked/week revealed that 100% of those working ≥80 h/week report experiencing burnout. CONCLUSION: Overall burnout rates reported by surgical residents respondents were high. Community teaching hospital setting, female gender, and increased number of hours worked per week may be associated with higher rates of burnout. Both female and community-affiliated residents were at increased risk of reporting suicidal ideation. Targeted interventions are needed to adequately address program-specific causes for resident burnout and reduce its prevalence in high-risk cohorts.","Kinslow, Kyle; Sutherland, Mason; McKenney, Mark; Elkbuli, Adel",Ann Med Surg (Lond),601,1

Baseline characteristics may predict repeat hospitalization or death in these patients. Methods: A 103 patient-cohort, admitted for the first acute HFpEF episode, was monitored for six months. Baseline characteristics were recorded and their relation to the primary outcome of heart failure readmission (HFR) and secondary outcome of all-cause mortality was assessed. Results: We identified six independent determinants for HFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p = 0.07), hemoglobin (p = 0.04), left ventricle end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) (p = 0.07), E/e’ ratio (p = 0.004), left ventricle outflow tract velocity-time integral (LVOT VTI) (p = 0.045), and diabetes mellitus (p = 0.06). Three of the variables were used to generate a risk score for HFR: LVEDD, E/e’, LVOT VTI -DEI Score = − 28.763 + 4.558 × log (LVEDD (mm)) + 1.961 × log (E/e’ ratio) + 1.759 × log (LVOT VTI (cm)). Our model predicts a relative amount of 20.50% of HFR during the first 6 months after the first acute hospitalization within the general population with HFpEF with a DEI Score over −0.747.

Residents’ ability to share their experiences are impeded, due to a high degree of cognitive problems and frailty, and previous studies are thus mainly based on reports from staff. Therefore, we aimed to give voice to the residents by investigating their relatives’ experiences with elder abuse in NH. METHODS: Qualitative individual interviews were conducted with 16 relatives of residents with experience of abuse and/or neglect in NH. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Relatives perceived neglect as most pervasive and staff-to-resident psychological abuse as a key problem. Physical abuse was mostly related to resident-to-resident aggression. Relatives perceived elder abuse in NH to be related to low competence among staff, low staffing, poor NH leadership, working cultures characterized by fear and loyalty to employer or co-workers, and a lack of individualized care for the residents. Furthermore, relatives themselves experienced maltreatment from NH, which caused them to suffer stress, anxiety and distrust. Relatives also expressed a need to compensate for lack of care. CONCLUSIONS: Relatives of NH residents who had experienced abuse reported that neglect of basic care and individual rights was predominant and viewed organizational explanations as most important. Relatives perceive themselves as collaborators in care and are emotionally attached to their family member. Therefore, if relatives experience resident abuse or neglect, it inflicts a feeling of being mistreated themselves, particularly if they are not listened to or their notice of abuse on the part of the resident is ignored or trivialized. Including relatives in a committed partnership with NH in care practices is not only a valuable path to reduce the risk of abuse, but it also leads to a more sustainable healthcare with high standards of quality and safety.","Saga, Susan; Blekken, Lene Elisabeth; Nakrem, Sigrid; Sandmoe, Astrid",BMC Health Serv Res,601,9

Transmission occurs primarily through direct physical head-to-head contact. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a variant of the coronavirus. Therefore, on March 18, 2020, the Argentinean government established mandatory isolation for an indefinite period. This obligatory isolation interrupted regular classes avoiding direct contact between children, thus affecting the dispersal route of individuals and the evolution of head louse populations. In this study, we evaluated through an online survey how confinement affected the prevalence of lice during lockdown compared to the situation prior to confinement. The survey allowed to discriminate the different control strategies, the number of treatments, and the amount of insects recorded by parents. Data of 1118 children obtained from 627 surveys were analyzed. As the main result, it was observed that prevalence of lice decreased significantly from before (69.6%) to during (43.9%) COVID-19 lockdown. Moreover, head lice infestation was more effectively controlled in households with up to 2 children in comparison to households with 3 or more children. This is the first study that analyzed the prevalence of head lice during COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Providers (n = 93) completed online surveys with quantitative measures and open-ended items exploring their reactions to COVID-19 and to the transition to providing services via telehealth. RESULTS: Perceptions of personal risk and rumination around COVID-19 were low, while telehealth was viewed positively by providers. Three major themes emerged regarding the major impacts of COVID-19 on work: (1) the altered nature of interactions between patient/client and provider due to telehealth implementation, (2) changes in provider expectations regarding productivity, and (3) challenges maintaining work-life balance. In regard to the major impacts of COVID-19 on EBP delivery, three themes emerged: (1) increased difficulty delivering certain therapies via telehealth, (2) potential limitations to session confidentiality, and (3) challenge of engaging children in telehealth.

RESULTS: Each year, January–June 52,907–73,184 patients were seen for a MH/SUD visit. While non-MH/SUD visits declined during the surge relative to 2020 pre-pandemic (−38.2%), MH/SUD visits increased (9.1%)—concentrated in primary care (35.3%) and non-Hispanic Whites (10.5%). During the surge, MH visit volume increased 11.7% while SUD decreased 12.7%. During partial reopening, while MH visits returned to 2020 pre-pandemic levels, SUD visits declined 31.1%; MH/SUD visits decreased by Hispanics (−33.0%) and non-Hispanic Blacks (−24.6%), and among Medicaid (−19.4%) and Medicare enrollees (−20.9%). Telemedicine accounted for ~5% of MH/SUD visits pre-pandemic and 83.3%–83.5% since the surge.

COVID-19 results in higher pathogenicity and mortality in the elderly compared to children. Examining baseline SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive coronavirus immunological responses, induced by circulating human coronaviruses, is critical to understand such divergent clinical outcomes. The cross-reactivity of coronavirus antibody responses of healthy children (n=89), adults (n=98), elderly (n=57), and COVID-19 patients (n=19) were analysed by systems serology. While moderate levels of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA were detected in healthy individuals, we identified serological signatures associated with SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific Fc{gamma} receptor binding, which accurately distinguished COVID-19 patients from healthy individuals and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 induces qualitative changes to antibody Fc upon infection, enhancing Fc{gamma} receptor engagement. Vastly different serological signatures were observed between healthy children and elderly, with markedly higher cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG observed in elderly, whereas children displayed elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM, including receptor binding domain-specific IgM with higher avidity. These results suggest that less-experienced humoral immunity associated with higher IgM, as observed in children, may have the potential to induce more potent antibodies upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

It details the rationale behind the guidance prepared to support MAR services in organizing and managing the re-start of treatments or in case of any future wave of COVID-19 disease. The guidance includes information on patient selection and informed consent, staff and patient triage and testing, adaptation of ART services, treatment planning and code of conduct. The initiatives detailed in this manuscript are not necessarily COVID-specific and such action plans could be applied effectively to manage similar emergency situations in different areas of medicine, in the future.","Gianaroli, Luca; Ata, Baris; Lundin, Kersti; Rautakallio-Hokkanen, Satu; Tapanainen, Juha S; Vermeulen, Nathalie; Veiga, Anna; Mocanu, Edgar",Hum Reprod,601,12

However, the role of platelets in the elevated observed thrombotic risk in COVID-19 and utility of antiplatelet agents in attenuating thrombosis is unknown. We aimed to determine if the antiplatelet effect of aspirin may mitigate risk of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and venous thromboembolism in COVID-19. We evaluated 22,072 symptomatic patients tested for COVID-19. Propensity-matched analyses were performed to determine if treatment with aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) affected thrombotic outcomes in COVID-19. Neither aspirin nor NSAIDs affected mortality in COVID-19. Thus, aspirin does not appear to prevent thrombosis and death in COVID-19. The mechanisms of thrombosis in COVID-19, therefore, appear distinct and the role of platelets as direct mediators of SARS-CoV-2-mediated thrombosis warrants further investigation.","Sahai, Aditya; Bhandari, Rohan; Godwin, Matthew; McIntyre, Thomas; Chung, Mina K; Iskandar, Jean-Pierre; Kamran, Hayaan; Hariri, Essa; Aggarwal, Anu; Burton, Robert; Kalra, Ankur; Bartholomew, John R; McCrae, Keith R; Elbadawi, Ayman; Bena, James; Svensson, Lars G; Kapadia, Samir; Cameron, Scott J",Vasc Med,601,1

Migrants provide the foundations of the agricultural workforce in the ‘breadbasket’ states of Punjab and Haryana in Northwest India.There are mounting concerns that near and potentially longer-term reductions in labor availability may jeopardize agricultural production and consequently national food security. The timing of rice transplanting at the beginning of the summer monsoon season has a cascading influence on productivity of the entire rice-wheat cropping system. To assess the potential for COVID-related reductions in the agriculture workforce to disrupt production of the dominant rice-wheat cropping pattern in these states, we use a spatial ex ante modelling framework to evaluate four scenarios representing a range of plausible labor constraints on the timing of rice transplanting. Averaged over both states, results suggest that rice productivity losses under all delay scenarios would be low as compare to those for wheat, with total system productivity loss estimates ranging from 9%, to 21%, equivalent to economic losses of USD $674 m to $1.48 billion. Late rice transplanting and harvesting can also aggravate winter air pollution with concomitant health risks. Technological options such as direct seeded rice, staggered nursery transplanting, and crop diversification away from rice can help address these challenges but require new approaches to policy and incentives for change.","Balwinder-Singh; Shirsath, Paresh B.; Jat, M.L.; McDonald, A.J.; Srivastava, Amit K.; Craufurd, Peter; Rana, D.S.; Singh, A.K.; Chaudhari, S.K.; Sharma, P.C.; Singh, Rajbir; Jat, H.S.; Sidhu, H.S.; Gerard, B.; Braun, Hans",Agric Syst,601,18

Traditional recommendation systems make recommendations based on the popularity of viral foods or user ratings. However, because of the different sentimental levels of users, deviations occur and it is difficult to meet the user’s specific needs. Based on the characteristics of viral food, this paper constructs a hybrid recommendation approach based on viral food reviews and label attribute data. A user-based recommendation approach is combined with a content-based recommendation approach in a weighted combination. Compared with the traditional recommendation approaches, it is found that the hybrid recommendation approach performs more accurately in identifying the sentiments of user evaluations, and takes into account the similarities between users and foods. We can conclude that the proposed hybrid recommendation approach combined with the sentimental value of food reviews provides novel insights into improving the existing recommendation system used by e-commerce platforms.","Song, Cen; Yu, Qing; Jose, Esther; Zhuang, Jun; Geng, He",Foods,601,20

However, it is not clear how SARS-CoV-2 can cause neurological dysfunctions and which molecular processes are affected in the brain. In this work, we examined the frontal cortex tissue of patients who died of COVID-19 for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, comparing qRT-PCR with ddPCR. We also investigated the transcriptomic profile of frontal cortex from COVID-19 patients and matched controls by RNA-seq analysis to characterize the transcriptional signature. Our data showed that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected by ddPCR in 8 (88%) of 9 examined samples while by qRT-PCR in one case only (11%). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that 11 genes (10 mRNAs and 1 lncRNA) were differential expressed when frontal cortex of COVID-19 patients were compared to controls. These genes fall into categories including hypoxia, hemoglobin-stabilizing protein, hydrogen peroxide processes. This work demonstrated that the quantity of viral RNA in frontal cortex is minimal and it can be detected only with a very sensitive method (ddPCR). Thus, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 does not actively infect and replicate in the brain; its topography within encephalic structures remains uncertain. Moreover, COVID-19 may have a role on brain gene expression, since we observed an important downregulation of genes associated to hypoxia inducting factor system (HIF) that may inhibit the capacity of defense system during infection and oxigen deprivation, showing that hypoxia, well known multi organ condition associated to COVID-19, also marked the brain.","Gagliardi, Stella; Emanuele Poloni, Tino; Pandini, Cecilia; Garofalo, Maria; Dragoni, Francesca; Medici, Valentina; Davin, Annalisa; Damiana Visonà, Silvia; Moretti, Matteo; Sproviero, Daisy; Pansarasa, Orietta; Guaita, Antonio; Ceroni, Mauro; Tronconi, Livio; Cereda, Cristina",Brain Behav Immun,601,1

We performed phylogenetic analysis and structural reconstruction of the spike glycoproteins with subsequent alignment and comparison. Our phylogenetic results revealed that SARS‐CoV‐2 was more similar to the bats' betacoronavirus isolates: HKU5‐related from Pipistrellus abramus and HKU4‐related from Tylonycteris pachypus. We also identified a yak betacoronavirus strain, YAK/HY24/CH/2017, as the closest match in the comparison of the structural models of spike glycoproteins. Interestingly, a set of unique features has been described for this particular strain of the yak betacoronavirus.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment data of 5,061 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 in South Korea from January 20 to April 8, 2020. To evaluate the effect of hormone therapy on clinical outcomes among women, subgroup analyses using age-matched case-control data were performed. RESULTS: Coronavirus disease 2019 was most prevalent in women in the 20-39 years age group (1,250 [44.14%]). Men were more likely to receive oxygen therapy (144 [6.46%] vs 131 [4.63%], P = 0.004), be admitted to the intensive care unit (60 [2.69%] vs 53 [1.87%], P = 0.049), and have a longer length of stay after admission to the intensive care unit (19.70 ± 11.80 vs 14.75 ± 9.23, P = 0.016). However, there was no significant difference in the mortality rate (men vs women: 42 [1.88%] vs 42 [1.48%], P = 0.267). In the multivariable Cox analysis, older age and underlying comorbidities, but not sex, were independent risk factors for mortality.

The problems of the infections are exacerbated by rapid transmission of the pathogenic agents, which occur through inhalation and direct contact with contaminated surfaces. Moreover, cross-species transmission resulting from changes to viral genetic makeup poses a risk for emergence of pathogens with new characteristics, which in some cases may be responsible for causing different diseases. With the advent of efficient sequencing and nucleic acid-based virus-disabling technologies, gene therapy is well placed to advance new treatments to counter respiratory infections. Most studies aimed at using nucleic acids to treat respiratory viral infections have used RNA interference (RNAi) to silence viral gene targets. A few studies have used silencing of host factors required by the viruses as a means of inhibiting viral replication and preventing emergence of escape mutants. By administering antivirals to the airways, studies performed in vivo have taken advantage of the anatomy of the respiratory system to deliver therapeutic nucleic acids. Reported data have shown proof of principle of efficacy of gene therapy in models of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, influenza virus A, and measles virus, among others. RNAi-based gene therapy has been advanced to clinical trial for treatment of RSV infection.

APP overexpression interferes with neurite outgrowth, while BACE1 plays a role in Aβ generation. Medicinal herbs with effects on neurite outgrowth stimulation and BACE1 inhibition may benefit AD. This study aimed to investigate the neurite outgrowth stimulatory effect, along with BACE1 inhibition of Caesalpinia mimosoides (CM), using wild-type (Neuro2a) and APP (Swedish mutant)-overexpressing (Neuro2a/APPSwe) neurons. The methanol extract of CM leaves stimulated neurite outgrowth in wild-type and APP-overexpressing cells. After exposure to the extract, the mRNA expression of the neurite outgrowth activation genes growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and teneurin-4 (Ten-4) was increased in both Neuro2a and Neuro2a/APPSwe cells, while the mRNA expression of neurite outgrowth negative regulators Nogo receptor (NgR) and Lingo-1 was reduced. Additionally, the extract suppressed BACE1 activity in the APP-overexpressing neurons. Virtual screening demonstrated that quercetin-3′-glucuronide, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, clausarinol, and theogallin were possible inhibitors of BACE1. ADMET was analyzed to predict drug-likeness properties of CM-constituents. These results suggest that CM extract promotes neurite outgrowth and inhibits BACE1 activity in APP-overexpressing neurons. Thus, CM may serve as a source of drugs for AD treatment.

As such, we calculated the cost-effectiveness of using remdesivir and dexamethasone for moderate to severe COVID-19 respiratory infections using the United States health care system as a representative model. A decision analytic model modelled a base case scenario of a 60-year-old patient admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Patients requiring oxygen were considered moderate severity, and patients with severe COVID-19 required intubation with intensive care. Strategies modelled included giving remdesivir to all patients, remdesivir in only moderate and only severe infections, dexamethasone to all patients, dexamethasone in severe infections, remdesivir in moderate/dexamethasone in severe infections, and best supportive care. Data for the model came from the published literature. The time horizon was 1 year; no discounting was performed due to the short duration. The perspective was of the payer in the United States health care system. Supportive care for moderate/severe COVID-19 cost $11,112.98 with 0.7155 quality adjusted life-year (QALY) obtained. Using dexamethasone for all patients was the most-cost effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $980.84/QALY; all remdesivir strategies were more costly and less effective. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed dexamethasone for all patients was most cost-effective in 98.3% of scenarios.

Available mortality estimates vary and differ in methodology. We undertook a retrospective mortality study in the Ouaka prefecture to obtain reliable mortality data. METHODS: We conducted a population-based two-stage cluster survey from 9 March to 9 April, 2020 in Ouaka prefecture. We aimed to include 64 clusters of 12 households for a required sample size of 3636 persons. We assigned clusters to communes proportional to population size and then used systematic random sampling to identify cluster starting points from a dataset of buildings in each commune. In addition to the mortality survey questions, we included an open question on challenges faced by the household. RESULTS: We completed 50 clusters with 591 participating households including 4000 household members on the interview day. The median household size was 7 (interquartile range (IQR): 4—9). The median age was 12 (IQR: 5—27). The birth rate was 59.0/1000 population (95% confidence interval (95%-CI): 51.7—67.4). The crude and under-five mortality rates (CMR & U5MR) were 1.33 (95%-CI: 1.09—1.61) and 1.87 (95%-CI: 1.37–2.54) deaths/10,000 persons/day, respectively. The most common specified causes of death were malaria/fever (16.0%; 95%-CI: 11.0–22.7), violence (13.2%; 95%-CI: 6.3–25.5), diarrhoea/vomiting (10.6%; 95%-CI: 6.2–17.5), and respiratory infections (8.4%; 95%-CI: 4.6–14.8). The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was 2525/100,000 live births (95%-CI: 825—5794). Challenges reported by households included health problems and access to healthcare, high number of deaths, lack of potable water, insufficient means of subsistence, food insecurity and violence. CONCLUSIONS: The CMR, U5MR and MMR exceed previous estimates, and the CMR exceeds the humanitarian emergency threshold. Violence is a major threat to life, and to physical and mental wellbeing. Other causes of death speak to poor living conditions and poor access to healthcare and preventive measures, corroborated by the challenges reported by households. Many areas of CAR face similar challenges to Ouaka. If these results were generalisable across CAR, the country would suffer one of the highest mortality rates in the world, a reminder that the longstanding “silent crisis” continues.

Previously described mechanisms include the development of a cytokine storm, missing immunoglobulin class switch, antibody-mediated enhancement, and aberrant antigen presentation. OBJECTIVES: To understand the heterogeneity of immune response in COVID-19, a thorough investigation of histomorphological patterns in regional lymph nodes was performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lymph nodes from the cervical, mediastinal, and hilar regions were extracted from autopsies of patients with lethal COVID-19 (n = 20). Histomorphological characteristics, SARS-CoV‑2 qRT-PCR, and gene expression profiling on common genes involved in immunologic response were analyzed. RESULTS: Lymph nodes displayed moderate to severe capillary stasis and edema, an increased presence of extrafollicular plasmablasts, mild to moderate plasmacytosis, a dominant population of CD8(+) T‑cells, and CD11c/CD68(+) histiocytosis with hemophagocytic activity. Out of 20 cases, 18 presented with hypoplastic or missing germinal centers with a decrease of follicular dendritic cells and follicular T‑helper cells. A positive viral load was detected by qRT-PCR in 14 of 20 cases, yet immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen revealed positivity in sinus histiocytes of only one case. Gene expression analysis revealed an increased expression of STAT1, CD163, granzyme B, CD8A, MZB1, and PAK1, as well as CXCL9. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings imply a dysregulated immune response in lethal COVID-19. The absence/hypoplasia of germinal centers and increased presence of plasmablasts implies a transient B‑cell response, implying an impaired development of long-term immunity against SARS-CoV‑2 in such occasions.","Haslbauer, Jasmin D.; Matter, Matthias S.; Stalder, Anna K.; Tzankov, Alexandar",Pathologe,601,16

In animal models, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) inhibits these detrimental changes and thereby reduces tissue injury. The aim of this study is to investigate whether non-invasive cervical VNS (nVNS) in addition to the current standard treatment can improve penumbral recovery and limit final infarct volume. METHODS: NOVIS is a single-center prospective randomized clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment. One hundred fifty patients will be randomly allocated (1:1) within 12 h from clinical stroke onset to nVNS for 5 days in addition to standard treatment versus standard treatment alone. The primary endpoint is the final infarct volume on day 5 assessed with MRI. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that nVNS will result in smaller final infarct volumes as compared to standard treatment due to improved penumbral recovery. The results of this study will be used to assess the viability and approach to power a larger trial to more definitively assess the clinical efficacy of nVNS after stroke.

Myocardial injury can be caused by direct or indirect damage, particularly mediated by a cytokine storm, a disordered immune response that can cause myocarditis, abnormal coagulation, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, and myocardial infarction. The present review focuses on the mechanisms of this viral infection, cardiac biomarkers, consequences, and the possible therapeutic role of purinergic and adenosinergic signalling systems. In particular, we focus on the interaction of the extracellular nucleotide adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with its receptors P2X1, P2X4, P2X7, P2Y1, and P2Y2 and of adenosine (Ado) with A2A and A3 receptors, as well as their roles in host immune responses. We suggest that receptors of purinergic signalling could be ideal candidates for pharmacological targeting to protect against myocardial injury caused by a cytokine storm in COVID-19, in order to reduce systemic inflammatory damage to cells and tissues, preventing the progression of the disease by modulating the immune response and improving patient quality of life.","dos Anjos, Fernanda; Simões, Júlia Leão Batista; Assmann, Charles Elias; Carvalho, Fabiano Barbosa; Bagatini, Margarete Dulce",J Immunol Res,601,28

However, in major holidays that happened during the pandemic, desires to nurture relationships and maintain holiday traditions often conflicted with physical distancing and other measures to protect against COVID-19. The current research sought to understand wellbeing during American Thanksgiving in 2020, which happened 8months into the COVID-19 pandemic, after months of physical distancing and stay-at-home orders. American Thanksgiving is a major holiday not limited to any religion. We asked 404 American adults how they spent Thanksgiving Day and to report on their experiences of that day. Predictors of wellbeing that we drew from self-determination theory were satisfaction of the fundamental needs for social connection (relatedness), for doing what one really wants (autonomy), and feeling effective (competence). The predictors of wellbeing that we drew from regulatory focus theory were a focus on growth (promotion), and a focus on security (prevention). We found that feeling socially connected and focusing on growth related most strongly to wellbeing. Additionally, participants who saw even one other person face-to-face reported significantly higher relatedness satisfaction, promotion focus, and wellbeing than those who did not. Our research could help construct persuasive messages that encourage nurturing close relationships at major holidays while remaining safe against the virus.","Vaughn, Leigh Ann; Burkins, Patricia G.; Chalachan, Rachael D.; Judd, Janak K.; Garvey, Chase A.; Luginsland, John W.",Front Psychol,601,1

COVID-19 showed us that these barriers pertain not just to heath systems, but also to the conduct of health research. We completed fieldwork in one hamlet before lockdowns were announced and changed our fieldwork approach for the remaining two different hamlets. The main change was a shift to the use of mobile telephony for fieldwork. This technological shift necessitated substantial changes in the design of fieldwork, the scope of our inquiry, as well as the composition and power dynamics within our team. First, adjusting to technology-driven fieldwork posed restrictions but also enhanced the agency and comfort of participants in some ways. Study design changes attributable to COVID-19 restrictions were brought about, but also gave us critical insight into the impact of COVID-19 and related outbreaks.

The disease was first identified in December 2019 and has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. AIM: To explore the clinical characteristics and treatments for COVID-19 in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Area in China. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the blood cell counts (neutrophils and lymphocytes), blood gas analysis, and thoracic computed tomography changes of patients from Qinghai Province before, during, and after treatment (January 23, 2020 to February 21, 2020). In addition, we summarized and analyzed the information of critical patients. All data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States). The quantitative and count variables are represented as the mean ± SD and n (%), respectively. RESULTS: The main symptoms and signs of patients with COVID-19 were fever, dry cough, cough with phlegm, difficulty breathing, and respiratory distress with a respiration rate ≥ 30 times/min, finger oxygen saturation ≤ 93% in the resting state, and oxygenation index less than 200 but greater than 100 (after altitude correction). Eighteen patients with COVID-19, of whom three were critical, and the others were in a mild condition, were included. The main manifestations included fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Three patients developed difficulty breathing and had a fever. They were eventually cured and discharged. Adjuvant examinations showed one case with reduced white cell count (6%) (< 4 × 10(9)/L), six with reduced count of lymphocytes (33%) (< 0.8 × 10(9)/L), and one with abnormal blood glucose level.

Donor and acceptor template homology facilitates both replicative and recombinogenic transfers, but homology-independent determinants may also contribute. Here, improved murine leukemia virus-based assays were established and the effects of varying extents of mismatches and complementarity between primer and acceptor template regions were assessed. Template switch accuracy was addressed by examining provirus structures, and efficiency was measured using a competitive titer assay. The results demonstrated that limited mismatch extension occurred readily during both minus and plus strand transfer. A strong bias for correct targeting to the U3/R junction and against use of alternate regions of homology was observed during minus strand transfer. Transfer to the U3/R junction was as accurate with five bases of complementarity as it was with an intact R, and as few as 3nt targeted transfer to a limited extent. In contrast, 12 base recombinogenic acceptors were utilized poorly and no accurate switch was observed when recombination acceptors retained only five bases of complementarity. These findings confirm that murine leukemia virus replicative and recombinogenic template switches differ in homology requirements, and support the notion that factors other than primer–template complementarity may contribute to strong stop acceptor template recognition.","Marr, Sharon Fodor; Telesnitsky, Alice",Journal of Molecular Biology,601,1

The aim of this scoping review was to assess the extent, range and nature of published research related to formal systems for recognising and responding to clinical deterioration in emergency department (ED) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a scoping review according to PRISMA-ScR guidelines. MEDLINE complete, CINAHL and Embase were searched on 07 April 2021 from their dates of inception. Human studies evaluating formal systems for recognising and responding to clinical deterioration occurring after triage that were published in English were included. Formal systems for recognising and responding to clinical deterioration were defined as: i) predefined patient assessment criteria for clinical deterioration (single trigger or aggregate score), and, or ii) a predefined, expected response should a patient fulfil the criteria for clinical deterioration. Studies of short stay units and observation wards; deterioration during the triage process; system or score development or validation; and systems requiring pathology test results were excluded. The following characteristics of each study were extracted: author(s), year, design, country, aims, population, system tested, outcomes examined, and major findings. RESULTS: After removal of duplicates, there were 2696 publications. Of these 33 studies representing 109,066 patients were included: all were observational studies. Twenty-two aggregate scoring systems were evaluated in 29 studies and three single trigger systems were evaluated in four studies. There were three major findings: i) few studies reported the use of systems for recognising and responding to clinical deterioration to improve care of patients whilst in the ED; ii) the systems for recognising clinical deterioration in ED patients were highly variable and iii) few studies reported on the ED response to patients identified as deteriorating. CONCLUSION: There is a need to re-focus the research related to use of systems for recognition and response to deteriorating patients from predicting various post-ED events to their real-time use to improve patient safety during ED care.

A. fumigatus secretes siderophores to acquire iron during infection, which are also essential for virulence.

A single monoclonal antibody sequence was ultimately elucidated by a combinatorial strategy involving protein LC-MS/MS, cDNA sequencing and RNAseq.

The disease spread rapidly across the globe and brought the world of sports to an unprecedented stoppage. Usual symptoms of the disease are fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat and headache. In more severe cases, dyspnoea, hypoxaemia, respiratory failure, shock and multiorgan failure occur. This appears to be a self-limiting phenomenon related to individuals with coexisting medical conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Nevertheless, cases have been reported in professional soccer players in extremely good fitness condition, demonstrating that athletes are not spared by the disease. Despite COVID-19 clinical manifestations are mainly respiratory, major cardiac complications are being reported, leading to acute myocarditis. One difficulty is that symptoms of COVID-19 vary among individuals, with athletes being affected with no apparent sign of the disease. This could be a real danger for amateur or professional athletes when returning to their usual training and thus to play. Another threat is that the lock-down policies did not allow most athletes to follow their usual training routines. There is thus a need for a careful approach by the sports medicine community to ensure safety of all athletes before they return to sport. Here, we propose evaluation guidelines of fitness and health of athletes to (1) reduce any lethal risk of practice, especially myocarditis and sudden cardiac death; (2) evaluate the combined consequences of the disease and detraining on the physical abilities and biological profile of athletes; and (3) monitor postinfection fatigue symptoms.","Fabre, Jean-Bernard; Grelot, Laurent; Vanbiervielt, William; Mazerie, Julien; Manca, Raphael; Martin, Vincent",BMJ Open Sport Exerc Med,601,1

Hemiparesis, referring to impaired functionality in one side of the body, is a common complication of perinatal stroke. Standard long-term care for hemiparetic CP focuses on rehabilitation therapies. Early research suggests that patients with hemiparesis may benefit from adjunctive neuromodulation treatments such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS uses electric current to stimulate targeted areas of the brain non-invasively, potentially enhancing the effects of motor learning therapies. This protocol describes an economic evaluation to be conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the incremental cost of tDCS added to a camp-based therapy compared with camp-based therapy alone per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in children with hemiparetic CP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Stimulation for Perinatal Stroke Optimising Recovery Trajectories (SPORT) trial is a multicentre RCT evaluating tDCS added to a 2-week camp-based therapy for children aged 6–18 years with perinatal ischaemic stroke and disabling hemiparetic CP affecting the upper limb. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 1 week, 2 months and 6 months following intervention. Cost and quality of life data are collected at baseline and 6 months and results will be used to conduct a cost–utility analysis (CUA). The evaluation will be conducted from the perspectives of the public healthcare system and society. The CUA will be conducted over a 6-month time horizon.

Here, we examine the possibility that the multivalent RNA-binding nucleocapsid protein (N) from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) compacts RNA via protein-RNA liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and that N interactions with host RNA-binding proteins are mediated by phase separation. To this end, we created a construct expressing recombinant N fused to a N-terminal maltose binding protein tag which helps keep the oligomeric N soluble for purification. Using in vitro phase separation assays, we find that N is assembly-prone and phase separates avidly. Phase separation is modulated by addition of RNA and changes in pH and is disfavored at high concentrations of salt. Furthermore, N enters into in vitro phase separated condensates of full-length human hnRNPs (TDP-43, FUS, and hnRNPA2) and their low complexity domains (LCs). However, N partitioning into the LC of FUS, but not TDP-43 or hnRNPA2, requires cleavage of the solubilizing MBP fusion. Hence, LLPS may be an essential mechanism used for SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viral genome packing and host protein co-opting, functions necessary for viral replication and hence infectivity.","Perdikari, Theodora Myrto; Murthy, Anastasia C.; Ryan, Veronica H.; Watters, Scott; Naik, Mandar T.; Fawzi, Nicolas L.",bioRxiv,601,11

Its rapid spreading has sent billions of people into lockdown as health services struggle to cope up. The COVID-19 outbreak comes along with an exponential growth of new infections, as well as a growing death count. A major goal to limit the further exponential spreading is to slow down the transmission rate, which is denoted by a “spread factor (f)”, and we proposed an algorithm in this study for analyzing the same. This paper addresses the potential of data science to assess the risk factors correlated with COVID-19, after analyzing existing datasets available in “ourworldindata.org (Oxford University database)”, and newly simulated datasets, following the analysis of different univariate “Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)” models for forecasting new cases and resulting deaths. The result shows that vanilla, stacked, and bidirectional LSTM models outperformed multilayer LSTM models. Besides, we discuss the findings related to the statistical analysis on simulated datasets. For correlation analysis, we included features, such as external temperature, rainfall, sunshine, population, infected cases, death, country, population, area, and population density of the past three months—January, February, and March in 2020. For univariate timeseries forecasting using LSTM, we used datasets from 1 January 2020, to 22 April 2020.","Chatterjee, Ayan; Gerdes, Martin W.; Martinez, Santiago G.",Sensors (Basel),601,21

The structure of MRL was observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis confirmed the lipase conjugated to Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles. Optimized conditions for the process of biodiesel production by MRL were investigated by the response surface methodology (RSM) and the Box-Behnken design (BBD). The optimized conditions for biodiesel production by MRL were as follows. The molar ratio of methanol to oil was 4.0, water content was 1.5 % as oil weight, the dosage of MRL to oil was 9.0 % (W/W) under 41 °C for 28 h. Under the optimized conditions, the yield of FAMEs by MRL reached 82.20 %. Further experiments showed that the MRL could be used 10 cycles and the yield of FAMEs decreased slightly by 10.97 %. These results indicated that Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticle carrier could efficiently improve the FAMEs synthesis and enhance the MRL stabilization and reusability in the biodiesel production.","Li, Jing; Zhang, Jiandong; Shen, Shuguang; Zhang, Bing; Yu, William W.",Mater Today Commun,601,18

The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on some of these challenges, as academic parents shifted to working from home while simultaneously caring for children. On the other hand, many parents found that the shift to working from home offered new opportunities such as working more flexible hours, development of digital skillsets, and increased involvement in the education of their children. In this article we explore the work-related challenges and opportunities experienced by academic parents as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and offer potential long-term solutions for academic parents and their universities. We use the following methods: (1) a literature review focused on identifying the work-related challenges academic parents faced prior to the pandemic, as well as the impact of the pandemic on scientists and working parents and (2) administer a world-wide survey with the goal of identifying the challenges and opportunities associated with parenting and academic work through the COVID-19 lockdown (304 total responses; 113 complete). Moving forward these findings have enabled conclusions to be drawn in order to shape a new normal.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe, life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate that has increased in frequency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite decades of laboratory and clinical study, no efficient pharmacological therapy for ARDS has been found. An increase in endothelial permeability is the primary event in ARDS onset, causing the development of pulmonary edema that leads to respiratory failure. Currently, the detailed molecular mechanisms regulating endothelial permeability are poorly understood. Therefore, the use of the PDD approach in the search for efficient ARDS treatment can be more productive than classic target-based drug discovery (TDD), but its use requires a new cell-based assay compatible with high-throughput (HTS) and high-content (HCS) screening. Here we report the development of a new plate-based image cytometry method to measure endothelial barrier function. The incorporation of image cytometry in combination with digital image analysis substantially decreases assay variability and increases the signal window. This new method simultaneously allows for rapid measurement of cell monolayer permeability and cytological analysis. The time-course of permeability increase in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) in response to the thrombin and tumor necrosis factor &#945; treatment correlates with previously published data obtained by transendothelial resistance (TER) measurements. Furthermore, the proposed image cytometry method can be easily adapted for HTS/HCS applications.","Dubrovskyi, Oleksii; Hasten, Erica; Dudek, Steven M; Flavin, Michael T; Chan, Leo Li-Ying",SLAS Discov,601,1

Students using VR simulators are provided with a 3D human model to observe the details by using multiple senses and they can participate in an environment that is similar to reality. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to promote a new approach consisting of a shared and independent study platform for medical orthopedic students, to compare traditional tendon repair training with VR simulation of tendon repair, and to evaluate future applications of VR simulation in the academic medical field. METHODS: In this study, 121 participants were randomly allocated to VR or control groups. The participants in the VR group studied the tendon repair technique via the VR simulator, while the control group followed traditional tendon repair teaching methods. The final assessment for the medical students involved performing tendon repair with the “Kessler tendon repair with 2 interrupted tendon repair knots” (KS) method and the “Bunnell tendon repair with figure 8 tendon repair” (BS) method on a synthetic model. The operative performance was evaluated using the global rating scale. RESULTS: Of the 121 participants, 117 participants finished the assessment and 4 participants were lost to follow-up. The overall performance (a total score of 35) of the VR group using the KS method and the BS method was significantly higher (P<.001) than that of the control group. Thus, participants who received VR simulator training had a significantly higher score on the global rating scale than those who received traditional tendon repair training (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that compared with the traditional tendon repair method, the VR simulator for learning tendon suturing resulted in a significant improvement of the medical students in the time in motion, flow of operation, and knowledge of the procedure. Therefore, VR simulator development in the future would most likely be beneficial for medical education and clinical practice.

Here, we sought to validate the MSL-COVID-19 score, originally developed to predict COVID-19 mortality in Mexicans. Also, an adaptation of the formula is proposed for the prediction of COVID-19 severity in a triage setting (Nutri-CoV). METHODS: We included patients evaluated from March 16(th) to August 17(th), 2020 at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición, defining severe COVID-19 as a composite of death, ICU admission or requirement for intubation (n = 3,007). We validated MSL-COVID-19 for prediction of mortality and severe disease. Using Elastic Net Cox regression, we trained (n = 1,831) and validated (n = 1,176) a model for prediction of severe COVID-19 using MSL-COVID-19 along with clinical assessments obtained at a triage setting. RESULTS: The variables included in MSL-COVID-19 are: pneumonia, early onset type 2 diabetes, age > 65 years, chronic kidney disease, any form of immunosuppression, COPD, obesity, diabetes, and age <40 years. MSL-COVID-19 had good performance to predict COVID-19 mortality (c-statistic = 0.722, 95%CI 0.690–0.753) and severity (c-statistic = 0.777, 95%CI 0.753–0.801). The Nutri-CoV score includes the MSL-COVID-19 plus respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry. This tool had better performance in both training (c-statistic = 0.797, 95%CI 0.765–0.826) and validation cohorts (c-statistic = 0.772, 95%CI 0.0.745–0.800) compared to other severity scores. CONCLUSIONS: MSL-COVID-19 predicts inpatient COVID-19 lethality. The Nutri-CoV score is an adaptation of MSL-COVID-19 to be used in a triage environment. Both scores have been deployed as web-based tools for clinical use in a triage setting.","Bello-Chavolla, Omar Yaxmehen; Antonio-Villa, Neftali E.; Ortiz-Brizuela, Edgar; Vargas-Vázquez, Arsenio; González-Lara, María Fernanda; de Leon, Alfredo Ponce; Sifuentes-Osornio, José; Aguilar-Salinas, Carlos A.",PLoS One,601,1

Secondary objectives included measuring the effect of anti-IL-10 antibodies on calf health, performance, and shedding of less common diarrheal pathogens. A total of 133 calves, enrolled at 24 – 72 h of age, received a daily dose of 0.96 gm of egg yolk powder with anti-IL-10 antibodies (MAB, n = 71) or without anti-IL-10 antibodies (MEP, n = 62) split between 2 feedings for the first 11 d on feed at a calf ranch. Daily health evaluations were completed for 15 days after arrival and on d 56. Digital weights were collected at enrollment and d 56 and hipometer weights at enrollment, d 7 and 56. Packed cell volume and serum total protein concentration were measured at enrollment, d 7 and 14. Fecal pH was measured at enrollment, d 5 and 14, and fecal pathogen (C. parvum, coronavirus, rotavirus, and Salmonella spp) shedding was assessed at d 5 and 14. Continuous outcomes were compared between groups using a student’s t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Fecal pathogen shedding at d 14, respiratory disease at d 56, and antibiotic usage were compared using relative risk and chi square test. Fecal pH (median, IQR) on d 14 was 6.65 (6.39 – 6.99) and 6.52 (5.97 – 6.81) for MAB and MEP, respectively. On d 56, the risk of respiratory disease was lower for MAB compared to MEP (RR: 0.40; CI: 0.16 – 0.99). The risk for antibiotic treatment was lower for MAB compared to MEP treated calves (RR = 0.38; CI: 0.17 – 0.88). The risk of shedding rotavirus was higher in MAB (RR = 1.38; CI: 1.10 – 1.81) calves. After multivariable analyses, hipometer weights (LSM ± SE) were 1.7 ± 0.8 kg greater on d 56 in MAB compared to MEP; however ADG was 0.04 ± 0.02 kg/d lower in MAB calves. Total health score, diarrhea days, average respiratory score, packed cell volume, and serum total protein were not affected by feeding anti-IL-10 egg antibodies. In summary, feeding anti-IL-10 antibodies was associated with increased fecal pH, reduced risk of respiratory disease later in the preweaning period, and decreased antibiotic usage despite higher rotavirus infection. These findings might be associated with improved mucosal immunity, enhanced host defenses, or reduced susceptibility and warrant further investigation.","Raabis, S. M.; Ollivett, T. L.; Cook, M.

This study provides a new way to investigate the impact of the pandemic on carbon emissions by calculating the difference between the pandemic-free carbon emissions and the actual carbon emissions in 2020 based on scenario analysis. In this work, based on Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) method, two combined ARIMA-BPNN and BPNN-ARIMA simulation approaches were developed to simulate the carbon emissions of China, India, U.S. and EU with the pandemic-free scenario. The average relative error of the simulation was about 1%, which can provide reliable simulation result. The scenario simulation of carbon emission reduction in the US and EU in this work are almost the same as the inter-annual change rate of carbon emissions reported by the existing studies. However, the scenario simulation of carbon emission reduction in China and India is 5% larger than the inter-annual change rate of carbon emissions reported by the existing studies. In some sense, the impact of the pandemic on carbon emission reduction in developing countries might be underestimated.

Previous work has shown IDE plays an important role in VZV infection and virus cell-to-cell spread, which is the sole route for VZV spread in vitro. Here we report that a recombinant soluble IDE (rIDE) enhances VZV infectivity at an early step of infection associated with an increase in virus internalization, and increases cell-to-cell spread. VZV mutants lacking the IDE binding domain of gE were impaired for syncytia formation and membrane fusion. Pre-treatment of cell-free VZV with rIDE markedly enhanced the stability of the virus over a range of conditions. rIDE interacted with gE to elicit a conformational change in gE and rendered it more susceptible to proteolysis. Co-incubation of rIDE with gE modified the size of gE. We propose that the conformational change in gE elicited by IDE enhances infectivity and stability of the virus and leads to increased fusogenicity during VZV infection. The ability of rIDE to enhance infectivity of cell-free VZV over a wide range of incubation times and temperatures suggests that rIDE may be useful for increasing the stability of varicella or zoster vaccines.","Li, Qingxue; Ali, Mir A.; Wang, Kening; Sayre, Dean; Hamel, Frederick G.; Fischer, Elizabeth R.; Bennett, Robert G.; Cohen, Jeffrey I.",PLoS One,601,20

Hence, Deep Learning and Image Classification techniques can be employed to learn from these irregularities, and classify accordingly with high accuracy. This research presents an approach to create a classifier model named StackNet-DenVIS which is designed to act as a screening process before conducting the existing swab tests. Using a novel approach, which incorporates Transfer Learning and Stacked Generalization, the model aims to lower the False Negative rate of classification compensating for the 30% False Negative rate of the swab tests. A dataset gathered from multiple reliable sources consisting of 9953 Chest X-rays (868 Covid and 9085 Non-Covid) was used. Also, this research demonstrates handling data imbalance using various techniques involving Generative Adversarial Networks and sampling techniques. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity obtained on our proposed model were 95.07%, 99.40% and 94.61% respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of accuracy and false negative rate obtained by this paper outperforms the current implementations. We must also highlight that our proposed architecture also considers other types of viral pneumonia. Given the unprecedented sensitivity of our model we are optimistic it contributes to a better Covid-19 detection.","Autee, Pratik; Bagwe, Sagar; Shah, Vimal; Srivastava, Kriti",Phys Eng Sci Med,601,20

Over recent decades, risk managing institutions have experienced what by many has been described as a decline in public trust. Strategies like stakeholder involvement and communication of scientific uncertainties are increasingly implemented to rebuild levels of trust but often prove less effective. Also, trust-related research mainly revolves around the relation between regulators and authorities, on one hand, and the public, on the other, with less attention given to the role of the scientific risk assessor. In this paper, we argue that assessors can act to improve conditions of trust by adopting an understanding of risk, stressing uncertainty and knowledge aspects when conceptualizing and characterizing risk. While ‘full’ trust commonly is seen as an ideal situation and distrust as a state of affairs to be prevented, this approach involves recognizing distrust as a resource. Based on an example regarding the authorization and regulation of a feed additive and the Social Amplification of Risk Framework, we show how such a perspective affects trust, both as a filter for processing, interpreting and responding to risk-related information and as an impact following such processes. Drawing on a typology of trust, we also illustrate how this relates to different dimensions and forms of trust.","Fjaeran, Lisbet; Aven, Terje",Saf Sci,601,22

In this study Twenty vanillin derivatives together with monolaurin and tetrodotoxin were used as test sets to evaluate as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. The Structure-based pharmacophore modelling approach was also performed using 5RE6, 5REX and 5RFZ in order to analyse the binding site and ligand–protein complex interactions. RESULTS: The pharmacophore modelling mode of 5RE6 displayed two Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA) and one Hydrophobic (HY) interaction. Besides, the pharmacophore model of 5REX showed two HBA and two HY interactions. Finally, the pharmacophore model of 5RFZ showed three HBA and one HY interaction. Based on ligand-based approach, 20 Schiff-based vanillin derivatives, showed strong M(Pro) inhibition activity. This was due to their good alignment and common features to PDB-5RE6. Similarly, monolaurin and tetrodotoxin displayed some significant activity against SARS-CoV-2. From structure-based approach, vanillin derivatives (1) to (12) displayed some potent M(Pro) inhibition against SARS-CoV-2.

Matériels et méthodes Évaluation des freins à la vaccination par audit qualitatifs collectifs et individuels par deux médecins infectiologues intervenant dans deux unité de soins pénitentiaire en Ile de France. La première phase de l’intervention évaluait le nombre de vaccinés, de volontaires à la vaccination et de personnels ayant été infectés par le Covid-19. La deuxième phase a comporté quatre axes de communication : Premièrement réunion d’information collectives avec questions réponses en fin de présentation dans les locaux de l’unité sanitaire. Deuxièmement, une consultation personnalisée d’infectiologie, ciblée pour les réfractaires à la vaccination. Troisièmement, la remise d’une procédure formalisée, simplifié, avec un numéro de téléphone de rendez-vous de vaccination. Un mois plus tard, un rapport de retour d’expérience a été réalisé par le chef de service de l’unité sanitaire. Résultats Le 16/02/2021, à la première phase de l’audit, zéro des 88 personnels était vacciné, zéro des 88 n’avait entrepris de démarche pour se faire vacciner, 4(4,5 %) étaient volontaires « au bon moment », aucun ne se définissait comme anti vaccin et 3(3,4 %) avaient contracté le Covid-19. Au moment de l’entretien collectif : 27(30,5 %) membres du personnel étaient prévus et présent. Les principaux freins à la vaccination par ordre décroissant de fréquence étaient : « L’absence de recul chronologique suffisant », « Ne pas servir de cobayes », « la peur d’effets secondaires graves », « L’absence de clarté des informations transmises », « La défiance envers la gestion de la crise par les autorités », et « La complexité parmi le choix des vaccins proposés ». Au bilan de fin d’intervention un mois plus tard, l’ensemble des 27 présents à la réunion étaient vaccinés, et au totale 84(95,4 %) des personnels était vacciné selon le parcours de soins spécifiques proposé. Trois avaient une contre-indication temporaire, et 1 resta réfractaire malgré la consultation individuelle.

Moreover, an increasing number of COVID-19 patients have been noted to experience hepatic and pancreatic injury. In this study, we retrospectively investigated symptoms and laboratory findings related to the GI system in a single center in Athens, Greece, and assessed the role of these parameters in relation to survival and disease severity. METHOD: We retrospectively studied 61 adult COVID-19 patients admitted to the Army Share Fund Hospital (NIMTS) in Athens, Greece, from April 6th to May 6(th), 2020. RESULTS: Sixty-one COVID-19 cases were assessed in the study period. Regarding both survival and disease severity, diarrhea was the most common finding. The multivariate analysis revealed that elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase levels and low serum albumin levels were associated with worse patient survival (odds ratio [OR] 1.029, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.007-1.05, P=0.0088; and OR 0.219, 95%CI 0.066-0.723, P=0.0127, respectively). As far as disease severity is concerned, only a low serum albumin level (measured at hospital admission) was correlated with more severe disease (OR 0.025, 95%CI 0.004-0.161, P=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms should be considered for COVID-19 testing in a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, as these symptoms are observed more and more in clinical settings. As prospective studies begin to emerge, clinicians will have more robust research data to diagnose COVID-19 patients earlier and identify patients in need of more intensive treatment.","Tsibouris, Panagiotis; Ekmektzoglou, Konstantinos; Agorogianni, Alexandra; Kalantzis, Chrysostomos; Theofanopoulou, Antonia; Toumbelis, Klearchos; Petrogiannopoulos, Leonidas; Poutakidis, Charalambos; Goggaki, Stavroula; Braimakis, Ioannis; Vlachou, Erasmia; Pouliakis, Abraham; Apostolopoulos, Periklis",Ann Gastroenterol,601,28

Therefore, a multi-methods approach is used. First we use a systematic literature review for reviewing the state of the art of digital health applications in healthcare. Furthermore, the usage of digital health applications is mapped to the different processes in care delivery. Here we provide an exemplary process model of oncological care delivery. The analysis shows that including digital health solutions may be helpful for care delivery in most processes of medical care provisioning. However, research on digital health solutions focuses strongly on some few processes and specific disciplines while other processes and medical disciplines are underrepresented in literature.

We investigated the diagnostic performance of calprotectin in respiratory tract infections and compared it with the performance of heparin binding protein (HBP) and procalcitonin (PCT). Biomarkers were analyzed in patients with viral respiratory infections and patients with bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia and streptococcal tonsillitis (n = 135). Results were compared with values obtained from 144 healthy controls. All biomarkers were elevated in bacterial and viral infections compared to healthy controls. Calprotectin was significantly increased in patients with bacterial infections; bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia and streptococcal tonsillitis compared with viral infections. PCT was significantly elevated in patients with bacterial pneumonia compared to viral infections but not in streptococcal tonsillitis or mycoplasma caused infections. HBP was not able to distinguish between bacterial and viral causes of infections. The overall clinical performance of calprotectin in the distinction between bacterial and viral respiratory infections, including mycoplasma was greater than performance of PCT and HBP.

METHODS: Various student-run health clinics were initiated throughout Southwest Ohio in underserved settings precepted by healthcare profession faculty. Physician assistant, pharmacy, and medical student learning needs and interprofessional perceptions were assessed following clinic participation utilizing the Clinical Learning Environment Comparison Survey (CLECS) and qualitative comment to allow objectification of students’ perceptions to different clinical learning environments and the interprofessional setting. RESULTS: The survey had responses from medical, pharmacy, and physician assistant students (n = 60). Overall, students preferred traditional learning environments compared to previous simulated clinical experiences (p < .01). Significance for communication, holism, and the teaching-learning dyad was demonstrated comparing the traditional clinical experience to the simulated experience (p < .05). Pharmacy students felt their critical thinking skills were more significantly improved after the simulated environment (p < .05). Males more significantly favored teaching-learning dyad simulation vs. the traditional environment (F = 5.86, p < .05). Qualitative comments regarding the interprofessional experience included themes of teamwork, patient communication, and clinical skills. CONCLUSION: When comparing a traditional clinical experience in an interprofessional student-run clinic vs. previous simulated learning clinical environment, physician assistant, pharmacy, and medical students qualitatively and quantitatively perceive their learning needs are greater met in the volunteer student-run clinic for communication, holism, and the teaching-learning dyad.

In Sainte Anne Hospital (GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neuroscience, Paris, France) we have observed a lower incidence of symptomatic forms of COVID-19 among patients than among our clinical staff. This observation led us to hypothesize that psychotropic drugs could have a prophylactic action against SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients from the symptomatic and virulent forms of this infection, since several of these psychotropic drugs have documented antiviral properties. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a phenothiazine derivative, is also known for its antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recent in vitro studies have reported that CPZ exhibits anti-MERS-CoV and anti-SARS-CoV-1 activity. Methods: In this context, the ReCoVery study aims to repurpose CPZ, a molecule with an excellent tolerance profile and a very high biodistribution in the saliva, lungs and brain. We hypothesize that CPZ could reduce the unfavorable course of COVID-19 infection among patients requiring respiratory support without the need for ICU care, and that it could also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we plan a pilot, multicenter, randomized, single blind, controlled, phase III therapeutic trial (standard treatment vs. CPZ + standard treatment). Conclusion: This repurposing of CPZ for its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity could offer an alternative, rapid strategy to alleviate infection severity. This repurposing strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, and could save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easily managed side effects. Résumé Objectifs: La pandémie mondiale actuelle de COVID-19 a touché environ 2 350 000 personnes et fait plus de 160 000 morts. Nous avons observé dans le GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences (site Sainte-Anne, Paris, France) une incidence moins importante de formes symptomatiques de COVID-19 chez les patients que dans notre personnel soignant. Notre hypothèse est que les traitements psychotropes pourraient avoir une action prophylactique sur le SARS-CoV-2. Cette hypothèse est cohérente avec les propriétés antivirales connues de plusieurs psychotropes au premier rang desquels la chlorpromazine (CPZ). En plus de ses effets antipsychotiques classiques, plusieurs études in vitro ont également démontré une activité antivirale de cette phénothiazine via l'inhibition de l'endocytose dépendante des clathrines. Récemment, des études ont révélé un effet anti-MERS-CoV et anti-SARS-CoV-1 de la CPZ. Méthodes: Dans ce contexte, l’étude reCoVery, basée sur le repositionnement de la CPZ -molécule avec un excellent profil de tolérance et une biodistribution très élevée dans la salive, les poumons et le cerveau - vise à tester l’hypothèse que la CPZ pourrait diminuer l’évolution défavorable de l’infection COVID-19 chez des patients oxygénorequérants sans nécessité de soins en réanimation mais aussi réduire la contagiosité du SARS-CoV-2. Nous allons réaliser pour cela un essai thérapeutique pilote de phase III multicentrique, randomisé, contrôlé (traitement standard vs. CPZ + traitement standard) et en simple insu. Conclusion: Le repositionnement de la CPZ comme antiviral anti-SARS-CoV-2 offre une stratégie alternative et rapide pour atténuer la propagation du virus ainsi que la gravité et la létalité du COVID-19.","Plaze, Marion; Attali, David; Petit, Anne-Cécile; Blatzer, Michael; Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Vinckier, Fabien; Cachia, Arnaud; Chrétien, Fabrice; Gaillard, Raphaël",Encephale,601,28

Various policies and mechanisms have been put in place in an attempt to maintain national geographical coverage with access points while increasing the financial viability of the network. One such mechanism is represented by the six official criteria for access to post offices, expressed as a percentage of the UK population living within one mile, three miles, and six miles of a post office. The method for calculating compliance with these access criteria is not published. Nor will any granular results be published, but only an annual statement that the criteria are being met. This article examines geographical and temporal access to post offices in order to understand the territorial coverage of the network and the impact this has on the provision of basic banking services. The area under investigation is Wales, for which we are reviewing the Government’s official access criteria. Through the Post Office Ltd website, we are collecting up-to-date information on the locations and opening hours of post offices in Wales. In addition, a detailed population grid is combined with calculated areas of equidistant geographical access, called isochrones, to determine the number of people who have access to the post office network. The isochrones are based on the Welsh road network and are calculated for different travel modes and thresholds using a powerful routing engine. Our results show that the official access criteria are largely unmet in Wales. In addition, and in contrast to previous studies, we show a rural-urban divide not in terms of spatial access, but in the combination of spatial and temporal access. The results are of both practical and theoretical value and will hopefully inform policy makers.","Sonea, Andra; Westerholt, René",Appl Spat Anal Policy,601,20

However, being surrounded by supportive relationships and being motivated to cultivate personal interests might have decreased anxiety. In this pilot study, we collected the responses of 174 students from Italian University merit colleges to an online questionnaire, investigating their perceived anxiety, the quality of surrounding relationships, whether they were cultivating any personal interests and whether they had spent the period of lockdown in college or at home. Regression analyses indicated that both quality of relationships and personal interests predicted low levels of anxiety (p < 0.001). However, simple slope analyses showed that personal interests were negatively related to anxiety only at medium and high quality of relationships (p < 0.001), while no association was found at low quality of relationships. No differences were found between students who stayed in college or at home. These results suggest that Universities should promote accessibility to relationships and cultivation of personal interests to protect students’ mental health during mass emergencies such as the current pandemic, in the perspective of improving community resilience.","Nola, Marta; Guiot, Cecilia; Damiani, Stefano; Brondino, Natascia; Milani, Roberta; Politi, Pierluigi",Curr Psychol,601,16

The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of a large pediatric cohort exposed to xenobiotics, through the analysis of a Pediatric Poison Control Center (PPCc) registry. METHODS: This study, conducted in the Pediatric Hospital Bambino Gesù of Rome, a reference National Pediatric Hospital, collected data of children whose parents or caregivers contacted the PPCc by phone (group “P”), or who presented to the Emergency Department (group “ED”), during the three-year period 2014–2016. Data were prospectively and systematically collected in a pre-set electronic registry. Comparisons among age groups were performed and multivariable logistic regression models used to investigate associations with outcomes (hospital referral for “P”, and hospital admission for “ED”group). RESULTS: We collected data of 1611 children on group P and 1075 on group ED. Both groups were exposed to both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical agents. Pharmaceutical agent exposure increased with age and the most common route of exposure was oral. Only 10% among P group were symptomatic children, with gastrointestinal symptoms. Among the ED patients, 30% were symptomatic children mostly with gastrointestinal (55.4%) and neurologic symptoms (23.8%). Intentional exposure (abuse substance and suicide attempt), which involved 7.7% of patients, was associated with older age and Hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes the characteristics of xenobiotics exposures in different paediatric age groups, highlighting the impact of both pharmacological and intentional exposure. Furthermore, our study shows the utility of a specific PPCc, either through Phone support or by direct access to ED. PPCc phone counselling could avoid unnecessary access to the ED, a relevant achievement, particularly in the time of a pandemic.","Marano, M.; Rossi, F.; Ravà, L.; Khalil Ramla, M.; Pisani, M.; Bottari, G.; Genuini, L.; Zampini, G.; Nunziata, J.; Reale, A.; Barbieri, M.

To elucidate the precise mechanism of leader-priming, we cloned and sequenced the 5′-end of the mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA. The 5′-terminal sequences are identical to the leader sequences present at the 5′-end of the subgenomic mRNAs. Two possible hairpin loop structures and an AU-rich region around the 3′-end of the leader sequence may provide the termination site for leader RNA synthesis. The comparison of 5′-end genomic sequences and the intergenic start sites for mRNA transcription revealed that there are homologous regions of 7–18 nucleotides at the putative leader/body junction sites. Some intergenic regions contain a mismatching nucleotide within this homologous region. We propose that free leader RNA binds to the intergenic region due to this homology and is cleaved at the mismatching nucleotide before serving as a primer. Thus, the free leader RNA species may be longer than the leader sequences in the subgenomic mRNAs and different mRNAs may have different leader/body junction sites.","Shieh, Chien-Kou; Soe, Lisa H.; Making, Shinji; Chang, Ming-Fu; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,601,23

METHOD AND RESULTS: We included all patients reported to the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation from 1 January to 20 July 2020. We defined 16 March 2020 as the start of the pandemic. We assessed overall and 30-day mortality using Cox regression and logistic regression, respectively. We studied 1946 cases of OHCA and 1080 cases of IHCA during the entire period. During the pandemic, 88 (10.0%) of OHCAs and 72 (16.1%) of IHCAs had ongoing COVID-19. With regards to OHCA during the pandemic, the odds ratio for 30-day mortality in COVID-19-positive cases, compared with COVID-19-negative cases, was 3.40 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31–11.64]; the corresponding hazard ratio was 1.45 (95% CI 1.13–1.85). Adjusted 30-day survival was 4.7% for patients with COVID-19, 9.8% for patients without COVID-19, and 7.6% in the pre-pandemic period. With regards to IHCA during the pandemic, the odds ratio for COVID-19-positive cases, compared with COVID-19-negative cases, was 2.27 (95% CI 1.27–4.24); the corresponding hazard ratio was 1.48 (95% CI 1.09–2.01).

Each organ represents a unique environment for resident microorganisms. Due to their simple digestive anatomy, snakes are good models for studying microbiome variation along the GIT. Cloacal sampling captures the majority of the microbial diversity found in the GIT of snakes—yet little is known about the oral microbiota of snakes. Most research on the snake mouth and gut microbiota are limited to studies of a single species or captive-bred individuals. It therefore remains unclear how a host’s life history, diet, or evolutionary history correlate with differences in the microbial composition within the mouths and guts of wild snakes. We sampled the mouth and gut microbial communities from three species of Asian venomous snakes and utilized 16S rRNA microbial inventories to test if host phylogenetic and ecological differences correlate with distinct microbial compositions within the two body sites. These species occupy three disparate habitat types: marine, semi-arboreal, and arboreal, our results suggest that the diversity of snake mouth and gut microbial communities correlate with differences in both host ecology and phylogeny.","Smith, Sierra N.; Colston, Timothy J.; Siler, Cameron D.",Front Microbiol,601,1

Infectious disease specialists, pneumologists and intensivists were not enough to face the enormous amount of patients that needed hospital care; therefore, many doctors have been recruited from other medical specialties trying to take care of as many patients as possible. The ‘call to duty’ of such doctors for urgent COVID-19 cases, however, diverted the attention from the care of patients with chronic conditions, which might have been neglected or undervalued. In this extremely difficult time, the standard of care of chronic patients has been reduced and this might have determined an increased rate of complications secondary to undermanagement. Thousands of patients with acute and chronic non-COVID-19 conditions have not accessed specialist care in the last weeks in Italy. Moreover, even those patients who have had scheduled an outpatient visit did not attend it for fear of leaving their home or due to the inability to go. During the pandemic, there was a drastic reduction in the number of hospital admissions for any medical conditions different from COVID-19. Self-presentation to the emergency department (ED) has been discouraged and the patients’ own fear of being infected by going to the hospital led to also a significant decrease in ED access. During the lockdown, in San Giuseppe Hospital MultiMedica IRCCS, Milan, the ED admissions dropped from the mean of 2361/month in December 2019–February 2020 to 1102 (− 53%) and 861 (− 63%) in March and April 2020, respectively. For all the above-mentioned reasons, it is possible that some clinical conditions will further progress with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. To prevent this, it is essential that patients with chronic conditions should be at least monitored and managed with telephone or online health consultation, identifying those who need urgent access to care, prioritizing outpatient visits based on disease severity. Patients with mild conditions could be managed outside the hospital by implementing telemedicine and creating networks of general practitioners who can consult with in-hospital specialists.","Mauro, Viganò; Lorenzo, Mantovani; Paolo, Cozzolino; Sergio, Harari",Intern Emerg Med,601,5

It goes beyond preventing the spread of diseases and reducing the disease burden. It includes interventions encompassing the creation of supportive environments, building public health policy, developing personal skills, reorienting health services and strengthening multisectoral community actions. AIM: The aim of the review was conduct an analysis on the opportunities and challenges of the use of social media for health promotion in South Africa. METHODS: A search of review articles on health promotion using social media conducted using Medline and Google Scholar. Secondary searches were conducted using references and citations from selected articles. RESULTS: Social media has potential of being an effective health promotion tool in South Africa. It presents an opportunity for scaling health promotion programs because of its low cost, its ability to have virtual communities and the ease of access eliminating geographical barriers. It also allows real-time communication between various stakeholders. It allows information to spread far and fast and leaving irrespective of the credibility of the source of information. There is a need to take into account country specific socio-economic issues, which may perpetuate unintended consequences related to the digital divide, data costs and the varying levels of health literacy. CONCLUSION: Considering the opportunities presented by social media, the National Department of Health needs to review its health promotion strategy and include the use of social media as an enabler.

Most countries, international organizations, and charitable organizations have been engaged in the R&D of COVID-19 vaccines to ensure timely affordability and accessibility to all countries. Concomitantly, the World Trade Organization (WTO) provides some provisions and enforcements regarding copyrights, patents, trademarks, geographical indications, and industrial designs. Given these safeguards, it is considered that intellectual property rights (IPRs) have become major barriers to the affordability and accessibility of vaccines/medicines/technology, particularly to the developing/least developed countries. Realizing the gravity of the pandemic impact, as well as its huge population and size, India has elevated this issue in its global health diplomacy by submitting a joint proposal with South Africa to the World Trade Organization (WTO) for a temporary waiver of IPRs to ensure timely affordability and accessibility of COVID-19 medical products to all countries. However, the issue of the temporary waive off had become a geopolitical issue. Countries that used to claim per se as strong advocates of human rights, egalitarianism, and healthy democracy have opposed this proposal. In this contrasting milieu, this paper is aimed at examining how the TRIPS has become a barrier for developing countries' development and distribution of vaccines/technology; secondly, how India strategizes its role in the WTO in pursuant of its global health diplomacy? We conclude that the IPRs regime should not become a barrier to the accessibility/affordability of essential drugs and vaccines. To ensure access, India needs to get more engaged in GHD with all the involved global stakeholders to get strong support for their joint proposal. The developed countries that rejected/resisted the proposal can rethink their full support.","Chattu, Vijay Kumar; Singh, Bawa; Kaur, Jaspal; Jakovljevic, Mihajlo",Biomed Res Int,601,33

One of the measures was to restrict access to family members of hospitalized patients. The presence of the patient’s family is considered an alternative to physical restraint. The aim of this study is to compare the use of physical restraint in hospitalized patients in an acute care hospital during the previous period of the pandemic of covid-19 with the post-confinement period with hospitals being still closed to family. Materials and methods: We made an observational study that compares the prevalence of physical restraint in an acute care hospital during the previous period to the alarm state (February 2020) with the second period, when visits where restricted (May 2020). From the clinical history of the patients with physical restraint we collected the following variables: sex, diagnostic, hospital admission unit, reason for using physical restraint, localization, length, type of material, registration in the medical record, information given to the family, alternatives to the physical restraint and injuries related to the physical restraint. Results: We evaluated 690 patients: 388 during the previous period and 320 during the second period. From all patients, 29 needed physical restraint. The use of physical restraint went from 8 (2%) to 21 (7%) (p=0.003).In the second period, a not statistically significant increase in continuous physical restraint was identified compared to the first period. Conclusions: The physical restraint prevalence has been superior during the second period in which families were not present with the hospitalized patients.","Font, Roser; Quintana, Salvador; Monistrol, Olga",J Healthc Qual Res,601,1

One clone of 2.0-kb contained part of the poly(A) tail and was sequenced in its entirety using the chemical method of Maxam and Gilbert. Another clone of 0.7 kb also contained part of the poly(A) tail and was sequenced in part to confirm the primary structure of the most 3′ end of the genome. Two potential, nonoverlapping genes were identified within the 3′-terminal 1663-base sequence from an examination of open reading frames. The first gene encodes a 382-amino acid protein of 43,426 mol wt, that is the apparent nucleocapsid protein on the basis of size, chemical properties, and amino acid sequence homology with other coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins. It is flanked on its 5′ side by at least part of the matrix protein gene. The second encodes a hypothetical 78-amino acid protein of 9101 mol wt that is hydrophobic at both ends. A 3′-proximal noncoding sequence of 276 bases was also determined and a conserved stretch of 9 nucleotides near the poly(A) tail was found to be common among TGEV, the mouse hepatitis coronavirus, and the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus.","Kapke, Paul A.; Brian, David A.",Virology,601,27

The survey had a total of 13 questions with (3–5) options and was designed with an aim to understand the perception and the state of mind of the Orthopaedic surgeons in the lockdown situation. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 611 orthopaedic surgeons from 140 cities in India. There were 22.5% orthopaedic surgeons who said that they were definitely stressed out, and 40.5% who said they were mildly stressed out. As the age decreased, the percentage of orthopaedic surgeons feeling “definitely stressed out” increased. Disruption of life-work balance and uncertainties regarding return to work were other strongly associated factors with the “definitely stressed out” group.

Macrophages and neutrophils constitute the majority of cells recruited into infected lungs, and are associated with immunopathology in influenza pneumonia. We examined pathological manifestations in models of macrophage- or neutrophil-depleted mice challenged with sublethal doses of influenza A virus H1N1 strain PR8. Infected mice depleted of macrophages displayed excessive neutrophilic infiltration, alveolar damage, and increased viral load, later progressing into ARDS-like pathological signs with diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and hypoxemia. In contrast, neutrophil-depleted animals showed mild pathology in lungs. The brochoalveolar lavage fluid of infected macrophage-depleted mice exhibited elevated protein content, T1-α, thrombomodulin, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and myeloperoxidase activities indicating augmented alveolar-capillary damage, compared to neutrophil-depleted animals. We provide evidence for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), entangled with alveoli in areas of tissue injury, suggesting their potential link with lung damage. When co-incubated with infected alveolar epithelial cells in vitro, neutrophils from infected lungs strongly induced NETs generation, and augmented endothelial damage. NETs induction was abrogated by anti-myeloperoxidase antibody and an inhibitor of superoxide dismutase, thus implying that NETs generation is induced by redox enzymes in influenza pneumonia. These findings support the pathogenic effects of excessive neutrophils in acute lung injury of influenza pneumonia by instigating alveolar-capillary damage.","Narasaraju, Teluguakula; Yang, Edwin; Samy, Ramar Perumal; Ng, Huey Hian; Poh, Wee Peng; Liew, Audrey-Ann; Phoon, Meng Chee; van Rooijen, Nico; Chow, Vincent T.",The American Journal of Pathology,601,16

Epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in monitoring the spread of the virus in the population and controlling possible outbreaks. However, sensitive sample preparation and detection methods are necessary to detect trace levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in influent wastewater (IWW). Unlike predecessors, method development of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and detection procedure was performed with IWW samples with high viral SARS-CoV-2 loads (in combination with seeding IWW with a surrogate coronavirus). This is of importance since the SARS-CoV-2 genome in IWW might have already been subject to in-sewer degradation into smaller genome fragments or might be present in a different form (e.g. cell debris,...). Centricon Plus-70 (100 kDa) centrifugal filter devices resulted in the lowest and most reproducible Ct-values for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Lowering pore sizes did not improve our limit of detection and quantification. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed for the amplification of the N1, N2, N3 and E_Sarbeco-gene. This is one of the first studies to apply digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW. Interestingly, qPCR results were comparable with dPCR results suggesting that qPCR is a valid method. In this study, dPCR was also used as a proxy to assess the precision of qPCR. In this light, dPCR showed high variability at low concentration levels (100 copies/{micro}L), indicating that variability in bioanalytical assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA might be substantial. On average, the N2-gene showed high in-sample stability in IWW for 10 days of storage at 4 {degrees}C. Between-sample variability was substantial due to the low native concentrations in IWW. Additionally, the E-gene proved to be less stable compared to the N2-gene and showed higher variability. Freezing the IWW samples resulted in a 10-fold decay of loads of the N2- and E-gene in IWW. Although WBE can already aid in filling some knowledge gaps in the epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, future WBE studies should aim to further validate and standardize bioanalytical assays, especially with regards to methodological limitations.

For several of these pathogens, neither antivirals nor vaccines are currently available. In addition to this unmet medical need, flaviviruses are of particular interest since they constitute an excellent model for the study of spatiotemporal regulation of RNA metabolism. Indeed, with no DNA intermediate or nuclear step, the flaviviral life cycle entirely relies on the cytoplasmic fate of a single RNA species, namely the genomic viral RNA (vRNA) which contains all the genetic information necessary for optimal viral replication. From a single open reading frame, the vRNA encodes a polyprotein which is processed to generate the mature viral proteins. In addition to coding for the viral polyprotein, the vRNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis and is also selectively packaged into newly assembled viral particles. Notably, vRNA translation, replication and encapsidation must be tightly coordinated in time and space via a fine-tuned equilibrium as these processes cannot occur simultaneously and hence, are mutually exclusive. As such, these dynamic processes involve several vRNA secondary and tertiary structures as well as RNA modifications. Finally, the vRNA can be detected as a foreign molecule by cytosolic sensors which trigger upon activation antiviral signaling pathways and the production of antiviral factors such as interferons and interferon-stimulated genes. However, to create an environment favorable to infection, flaviviruses have evolved mechanisms to dampen these antiviral processes, notably through the production of a specific vRNA degradation product termed subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA). In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the fates of flavivirus vRNA and how this is regulated at the molecular level to achieve an optimal replication within infected cells.","Mazeaud, Clément; Freppel, Wesley; Chatel-Chaix, Laurent",Front Genet,601,24

There is growing evidence of the reduction of stroke admissions and higher prevalence of severe clinical presentation. Yet, no studies have investigated the perfusion pattern of acute strokes admitted during the lockdown. We aimed to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on hyper-acute stroke CT perfusion (CTP) pattern during the first months of the pandemic in Italy. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed CTP images and clinical data of ischemic stroke patients admitted between 9 March and 2 June 2020 that underwent CTP (n = 30), to compare ischemic volumes and clinical features with stroke patients admitted during the same period in 2019 (n = 51). In particular, CTP images were processed to calculate total hypoperfused volumes, core volumes, and mismatch. The final infarct volumes were calculated on follow-up CT. RESULTS: Significantly higher total CTP hypoperfused volume (83.3 vs 18.5 ml, p = 0.003), core volume (27.8 vs 1.0 ml, p < 0.001), and unfavorable mismatch (0.51 vs 0.91, p < 0.001) were found during the COVID-19 period compared to no-COVID-19 one. The more unfavorable perfusion pattern at admission resulted in higher infarct volume on follow-up CT during COVID-19 (35.5 vs 3.0 ml, p < 0.001). During lockdown, a reduction of stroke admissions (− 37%) and a higher prevalence of severe clinical presentation (NIHSS ≥ 10; 53% vs 36%, p = 0.029) were observed.

Since then it had become a global pandemic. Such a pandemic leads to short- and long-term mental health burden for healthcare workers. Recent surveys suggest that rates of psychological stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia and will be high for this group. Numerous organizations have since released guidance on how both healthcare workers and the general public can manage the mental health burden. However, these recommendations focus on specific healthcare workers (e.g., nurses or psychologists), are often not evidence-based, and typically do not situate guidance within a phased model that recognizes countries are at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this perspective paper we propose a phased model of mental health burden and responses.

Staff within countries at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic will be able to use this model. We suggest practical tips for both healthcare workers and organizations and embed this within up-to-date scientific literature.

In this respect, a 4-variable assessment model, including lymphocyte, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil, is established and validated using the XGBoost algorithm. This model is found effective to identify severe COVID-19 cases on admission, with a sensitivity of 84.6%, a specificity of 84.6%, and an accuracy of 100% to predict the disease progression toward rapid deterioration. It also suggests that a computation-derived formula of clinical measures is practically applicable for the healthcare administrators to distribute hospitalization resources to the most needed in epidemics and pandemics.","Zheng, Yichao; Zhu, Yinheng; Ji, Mengqi; Wang, Rongpin; Liu, Xinfeng; Zhang, Mudan; Qin, Choo Hui; Fang, Lu; Ma, Shaohua",Patterns (N Y),601,24

However, treatment with sGP inhibited macrophage production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 while the yield of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, remained intact. Interestingly, the migratory ability of macrophages was also diminished by sGP, potentially due to a decrease in expression of CD11b, a vital macrophage integrin. Thus, EBOV sGP may operate to diminish functional contributions of non-infected macrophages to increase the potential viral dissemination.","Bradley, Jillian H.; Harrison, Ametria; Corey, Ashley; Gentry, Nathan; Gregg, Randal K.",Cell Immunol,601,20

Infectious diseases have a marked impact on pig production. Epidemiological indicators are considered the most useful criteria in decision-making; however, a health status assessment remains a challenge at the national and regional levels. This study proposes a health index including herd-losses, morbidity, fatality, and type of diseases, to rate the health situation in a region or country; it contributes to assessing the effectiveness of control, damage manifestation, and trends. It is a multidimensional index with a structure of triads and simple quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative expressions that use flexible and dynamics limits. With it, we analyzed twenty-one countries in 2005–2018, focusing on African swine fever, classical swine fever, foot-mouth-disease, and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome, diseases that caused 72% of the morbidity. Our multidimensional approach estimates farm, local, and regional impact from infectious agents and outbreaks, and apprises trends aiming to be useful to control measures, strategic actions, and animal health policies.","Zavala-Cortés, Aidé; Hernández, Gerardo; Calderón-Salinas, José-Víctor",Trop Anim Health Prod,601,20

We here try to clarify further how ranges of the fatty acids could make strong associations between their relative amounts, utilizing published data from chicken muscle and human sera. We generated random number variables (OA’, AA’, EPA’) in lieu of the true variables, and we studied effects of altering their ranges upon scatterplots of %OA’ vs. %AA’ (%EPA’), and %AA’ vs. %EPA’. To explain the results, we first applied the equation OA’ + AA’ + EPA’ = S, i.e., %OA’ + %AA’ + %EPA’ = 100. Next, we considered how the OA’ (AA’, EPA’) fractions of S related to S. Increasing the OA’ range towards higher values improved the positive association between %AA’ and %EPA’. Thus, increased intake of OA could improve the positive correlations between percentages of eicosanoid precursors, raising the question of whether “intended ranges” of some fatty acids represent a case of evolutionary selection to, e.g., achieve balance between eicosanoids.","Høstmark, Arne Torbjørn",Foods,601,16

Following AHV-1 infection, DEF showed morphological changes such as cell rounding, improved refractivity and detachment from the culture surface. However, its pathological characteristics were not adequately known. Related studies were performed and the results showed that syncytium formation could be observed as the other type of CPE in AHV-1 infection. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of infected DEF were each used to visualize the shape and distribution of chromatin within nuclei and nuclear fragmentation was observed. Chromatin condensation and margination, as well as formation of apoptotic bodies were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DNA ladder formation was detected in AHV-1 infected cells and apoptosis of the infected DEF was also detected by flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V-FITC/PI staining method. Therefore, it was suggested that AHV-1 virulent strain can induce syncytium and apoptosis in DEF.

OBJECTIVE: To define the respiratory tract microbiome in COVID-19 and relationship disease severity, systemic immunologic features, and outcomes. METHODS AND MEASUREMENTS: We examined 507 oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and endotracheal samples from 83 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, along with non-COVID patients and healthy controls. Bacterial communities were interrogated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, commensal DNA viruses Anelloviridae and Redondoviridae were quantified by qPCR, and immune features were characterized by lymphocyte/neutrophil (L/N) ratios and deep immune profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). MAIN RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had upper respiratory microbiome dysbiosis, and greater change over time than critically ill patients without COVID-19. Diversity at the first time point correlated inversely with disease severity during hospitalization, and microbiome composition was associated with L/N ratios and PBMC profiles in blood. Intubated patients showed patient-specific and dynamic lung microbiome communities, with prominence of Staphylococcus. Anelloviridae and Redondoviridae showed more frequent colonization and higher titers in severe disease. Machine learning analysis demonstrated that integrated features of the microbiome at early sampling points had high power to discriminate ultimate level of COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: The respiratory tract microbiome and commensal virome are disturbed in COVID-19, correlate with systemic immune parameters, and early microbiome features discriminate disease severity. Future studies should address clinical consequences of airway dysbiosis in COVID-19, possible use as biomarkers, and role of bacterial and viral taxa identified here in COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Merenstein, Carter; Liang, Guanxiang; Whiteside, Samantha A.; Cobián-Güemes, Ana G.; Merlino, Madeline S.; Taylor, Louis J.; Glascock, Abigail; Bittinger, Kyle; Tanes, Ceylan; Graham-Wooten, Jevon; Khatib, Layla A.; Fitzgerald, Ayannah S.; Reddy, Shantan; Baxter, Amy E.; Giles, Josephine R.; Oldridge, Derek A.; Meyer, Nuala J.; Wherry, E.

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library for COVID‐19 publications from 1 December 2019 to 18 May 2020. We included any study that reported the presence of GI symptoms in a sample of >5 COVID‐19 patients. Data collection and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Where ≥3 studies reported data sufficiently similar to allow calculation of a pooled prevalence, we performed random effects meta‐analysis. RESULTS: This review included 17 776 COVID‐19 patients from 108 studies. Isolated GI symptoms only occurred in 1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0–6%) of patients. GI symptoms were reported in 20% (95% CI 15–24%) of patients. The most common were anorexia (21%, 95% CI 15–27%), diarrhea (13%, 95% CI 11–16%), nausea or vomiting (8%, 95% CI 6–11%), and abdominal pain (4%, 95% CI 2–6%). Transaminase elevations were present in 24% (95% CI 17–31%) of patients. Higher prevalence of GI symptoms were reported in studies published after 1st April, with prevalence of diarrhea 16% (95% CI 13–20), nausea or vomiting 12% (95% CI 8–16%), and any GI symptoms 24% (95% CI 18–34%). GI symptoms were associated with severe COVID‐19 disease (odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% CI 1.3–3.2), but not mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.52–1.54). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with isolated GI symptoms may represent a small but significant portion of COVID‐19 cases. When testing resources are abundant, clinicians should still consider testing patients with isolated GI symptoms or unexplained transaminase elevations for COVID‐19. More recent studies estimate higher overall GI involvement in COVID‐19 than was previously recognized.","Dorrell, Robert D; Dougherty, Michael K; Barash, Eric L; Lichtig, Asher E; Clayton, Steven B; Jensen, Elizabeth T",JGH Open,601,1

Five experts used a heuristic evaluation procedure to independently rate all 16 websites on a severity scale of 0–4. Usability criteria published by the US Department of Health and Human Services and criteria on risk communication and data dashboards were used. Analyses involved cross tabulation of usability criteria with case counts, comparison of usability scores using Mood's median tests, test of differences in average usability scores using ANOVA and post-hoc tests, and identification of correlations between case counts and usability scores. Results from the Mood's median test showed that the median usability scores for the states were significantly different from each other at the 5% level of significance (df = 15, chi-square = 38.40; p = 0.001). ANOVA showed statistically significant differences between the mean usability scores for the states at the 5% level of significance (F = 6.33, p < 0.05).

A correlation has been identified between the severity of COVID-19 and a patient’s preexisting comorbidities. Although COVID-19 primarily involves the respiratory system, dysfunction in multiple organ systems is common, particularly in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune, renal, and nervous systems. Patients with amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis represent a population particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 morbidity due to the multisystem nature of ATTR amyloidosis. MAIN BODY: ATTR amyloidosis is a clinically heterogeneous progressive disease, resulting from the accumulation of amyloid fibrils in various organs and tissues. Amyloid deposition causes multisystem clinical manifestations, including cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy, along with gastrointestinal symptoms and renal dysfunction. Given the potential for exacerbation of organ dysfunction, physicians note possible unique challenges in the management of patients with ATTR amyloidosis who develop multiorgan complications from COVID-19. While the interplay between COVID-19 and ATTR amyloidosis is still being evaluated, physicians should consider that the heightened susceptibility of patients with ATTR amyloidosis to multiorgan complications might increase their risk for poor outcomes with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Patients with ATTR amyloidosis are suspected to have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality due to age and underlying ATTR amyloidosis-related organ dysfunction. While further research is needed to characterize this risk and management implications, ATTR amyloidosis patients might require specialized management if they develop COVID-19. The risks of delaying diagnosis or interrupting treatment for patients with ATTR amyloidosis should be balanced with the risk of exposure in the health care setting. Both physicians and patients must adapt to a new construct for care during and possibly after the pandemic to ensure optimal health for patients with ATTR amyloidosis, minimizing treatment interruptions.","Brannagan, Thomas H.; Auer-Grumbach, Michaela; Berk, John L.; Briani, Chiara; Bril, Vera; Coelho, Teresa; Damy, Thibaud; Dispenzieri, Angela; Drachman, Brian M.; Fine, Nowell; Gaggin, Hanna K.; Gertz, Morie; Gillmore, Julian D.; Gonzalez, Esther; Hanna, Mazen; Hurwitz, David R.; Khella, Sami L.; Maurer, Mathew S.; Nativi-Nicolau, Jose; Olugemo, Kemi; Quintana, Luis F.; Rosen, Andrew M.; Schmidt, Hartmut H.; Shehata, Jacqueline; Waddington-Cruz, Marcia; Whelan, Carol; Ruberg, Frederick L.",Orphanet J Rare Dis,601,1

It was shown that the largely used criteria of a historical all‐deaths baseline are not approachable in this case, where most of the deaths are associated with causes that should decrease due to social distancing and reduction of economic activities. A quite simple and intuitive model based on the Gompertz function was applied to estimate excess deaths and excess of infected cases. It fits well the data and predicts the evolution of the epidemic adequately. Based on these analyses, an excess of 21.638 deaths and 557.216 infected cases is predicted until the end of 2020, with an upper bound of the case fatality rate of around 2.4% and a prevalence of 2.6%.

METHODS: HNSCC cases (oropharynx/larynx/hypopharynx) treated with definitive RT‐hypo (60 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks), moderately accelerated radiotherapy (RT‐acc) alone (70 Gy in 35 fractions over 6 weeks), or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) during 2005‐2017 were included. Locoregional control (LRC) and distant control (DC) after RT‐hypo, RT‐acc, and CCRT were compared for various subgroups. RESULTS: The study identified 994 human papillomavirus–positive (HPV+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma cases (with 61, 254, and 679 receiving RT‐hypo, RT‐acc, and CCRT, respectively) and 1045 HPV– HNSCC cases (with 263, 451, and 331 receiving RT‐hypo, RT‐acc, and CCRT, respectively). The CCRT cohort had higher T/N categories, whereas the radiotherapy‐alone patients were older. The median follow‐up was 4.6 years. RT‐hypo, RT‐acc, and CCRT produced comparable 3‐year LRC and DC for HPV+ T1‐2N0‐N2a disease (seventh edition of the TNM system [TNM‐7]; LRC, 94%, 100%, and 94%; P = .769; DC, 94%, 100%, and 94%; P = .272), T1‐T2N2b disease (LRC, 90%, 94%, and 97%; P = .445; DC, 100%, 96%, and 95%; P = .697), and T1‐2N2c/T3N0‐N2c disease (LRC, 89%, 93%, and 95%; P = .494; DC, 89%, 90%, and 87%; P = .838). Although LRC was also similar for T4/N3 disease (78%, 84%, and 88%; P = .677), DC was significantly lower with RT‐hypo or RT‐acc versus CCRT (67%, 65%, and 87%; P = .005). For HPV– HNSCC, 3‐year LRC and DC were similar with RT‐hypo, RT‐acc, and CCRT in stages I and II (LRC, 85%, 89%, and 100%; P = .320; DC, 99%, 98%, and 100%; P = .446); however, RT‐hypo and RT‐acc had significantly lower LRC in stage III (76%, 69%, and 91%; P = .006), whereas DC rates were similar (92%, 85%, and 90%; P = .410). Lower LRC in stage III predominated in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma receiving RT‐acc (62%) but not RT‐hypo (80%) or CCRT (92%; RT‐hypo vs CCRT: P = .270; RT‐acc vs CCRT: P = .004). CCRT had numerically higher LRC in comparison with RT‐hypo or RT‐acc in stage IV (73%, 65%, and 66%; P = .336).

We identified the major topics in these journals by creating clusters based on terms co-occurrence over time. We also conducted a review of global health definitions during the same period. The analysis included 16 413 articles. The number of journals, labelled as global health, and articles published in these journals, increased dramatically during the study period. The majority of global health publications focused on topics prevalent in low-resource settings.

A written pandemic emergency plan and establishment of emergency management teams are critical to mounting a coordinated and effective response to what will be a catastrophic event. Members of these teams should include public health, medical, emergency response and public safety officials, organized at each local, state and federal level. The tragic events of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent anthrax attacks have substantially increased funding and support for bioterrorism planning in the United States. Thus, public health officials have an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen current systems' planning efforts by promoting dual use bioterrorism/pandemic influenza plans. Combining lessons learned from the 2001 terrorist incidents, recent preevent smallpox vaccine programs and the history of past influenza pandemics, more effective strategies can be developed. For example, enhanced influenza surveillance systems can provide data that will not only provide early identification of a novel influenza strain, but will provide more timely recognition of other outbreaks of infectious diseases, including public health threats that may initially present as an influenza-like illness (ILI). In recent years, we have witnessed emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats that have presented us with challenges similar to those posed by an influenza pandemic. Such events highlight the need for advance planning to ensure an optimal response to a health emergency that is certain to be unpredictable, complex, rapidly evolving and accompanied by considerable public alarm. While advance warning for a terrorist attack is unlikely, the warning already exists for a possible new influenza strain, as evidenced by the recent cases of H5N1 in Hong Kong and the rapid global spread of cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.","Gensheimer, K.F",Int Congr Ser,601,4

Unfortunately, some patients who may be or presumptively or confirmed as infected with COVID-2019 may also require emergent surgical procedures. As such, given the high-risk for exposure of many healthcare workers involved the complex requirements for appropriate isolation must be adhered to. CASE PRESENTATION: We present our experience with a 77-year-old who required emergency cardiac surgery for a presumed acute aortic syndrome in the setting of a presumed, and eventually confirmed, COVID-2019 infection. We outline the necessary steps to maintain strict isolation precautions to limit potential exposure to the surgical Team. CONCLUSIONS: We hereby provide our algorithm for emergent surgical procedures in critically-ill patients with presumptive or confirmed infection with COVID-2019. The insights from this case report can potentially be templated to other facilities in order to uphold high standards of infection prevention and patient safety in surgery during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Firstenberg, Michael S.; Libby, Matthew; Ochs, Michael; Hanna, Jennifer; Mangino, Julie E.; Forrester, Joseph",Patient Saf Surg,601,16

This study presents a systematic review of papers pertaining to the application of knowledge-driven systems in support of emergency management that have been published in the last two decades. Our review presents two major findings. First, only limited work has been done in three EMIS-knowledge management system (KMS) subdomains: (i) definition, (ii) use, and (iii) methods. Second, only limited research has been done in embedding roles in KM systems. We highlight role alignment to the 12 fundamental roles, as called for by Turoff et al.

Material and Methods: A multicenter retrospective observational study included 59 consecutive patients. The main goals were to evaluate the number, characteristics and practical conditions of tracheostomies, and the Covid-19 status of the otorhinolaryngologists. Secondary goals were to analyze tracheostomy time, decannulation rate, immediate postoperative complications and laryngotracheal axis status. Results: Tracheostomy indications were for ventilatory weaning and extubation failure in 86% and 14% of cases respectively. The technique was surgical, percutaneous or hybrid in 91.5%, 3.4% and 5.1% of cases respectively. None of the operators developed symptoms consistent with Covid-19. Postoperative complications occurred in 15% of cases, with no significant difference between surgical and percutaneous/hybrid techniques (p=0.33), although no complications occurred after percutaneous or hybrid tracheostomies. No procedures or complications resulted in death. The decannulation rate was 74.5% with a mean tracheostomy time of 20±12 days. In 55% of the patients evaluated by flexible endoscopy after decannulation, a laryngeal abnormality was found. On univariate analysis, no clinical features had a significant influence on tracheostomy time, decannulation rate or occurrence of laryngeal lesions.

Although our understanding of COVID-19 is still incomplete, a growing body of evidence is indicating potential direct deleterious effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems. Indeed, complex and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and functional impairments have often been observed after COVID-19. Early (defined as during and immediately after ICU discharge) rehabilitative interventions are fundamental for reducing the neurological burden of a disease that already heavily affects lung function with pulmonary fibrosis as a possible long-term consequence. In addition, ameliorating neuromuscular weakness with early rehabilitation would improve the efficiency of respiratory function as respiratory muscle atrophy worsens lung capacity. This review briefly summarizes the polymorphic burden of COVID-19 and addresses possible early interventions that could minimize the neurological and systemic impact. In fact, the benefits of early multidisciplinary rehabilitation after an ICU stay have been shown to be advantageous in several clinical conditions making an early rehabilitative approach generalizable and desirable to physicians from a wide range of different specialties.","Pincherle, Alessandro; Jöhr, Jane; Pancini, Lisa; Leocani, Letizia; Dalla Vecchia, Laura; Ryvlin, Philippe; Schiff, Nicholas D.; Diserens, Karin",Front Neurol,601,29

Early international healthcare experiences showed approximately 80% of patients with COVID-19 had mild disease and therfore could be managed as outpatients. However, SARS-CoV-2 can cause a biphasic illness with those affected experiencing a clinical deterioration usually seen after day 4 of illness. OBJECTIVE: We created an online tool with the primary objective of allowing for virtual disease triage among the increasing number of outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 at our hospital. Secondary aims included COVID-19 education and the promotion of official COVID-19 information among these outpatients, and analysis of reported symptomatology. METHODS: Outpatients with acute COVID-19 disease received text messages from the hospital containing a link to an online symptom check-in tool which they were invited to complete. RESULTS: 296 unique participants (72%) from 413 contacted by text completed the online check-in tool at least once, generating 831 responses from 1324 texts sent. 83% of text recipients and 91% of unique participants were healthcare workers. 7% of responses to the tool were from participants who admitted to a slight worsening of their symptoms during follow-up. Fatigue was the most commonly reported symptom overall (79%), followed by headache (72%). Fatigue, headache and myalgia were the most frequently reported symptoms in the first 3 days of illness. 8% of responses generated in the first 7 days of illness did not report any of the cardinal symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnoea, taste/smell disturbance) of COVID-19. Participants found the tool to be useful and easy to use, describing it as ‘helpful’ and ‘reassuring’ in a follow-up feedback survey (n=140). 93% said they would use such a tool in the future. 39% reported ongoing fatigue, 16% reported ongoing smell disturbance and 14% reported ongoing dyspnoea after 6 months.

It could be difficult to orientate the diagnosis or the therapeutic approach, not knowing if what is found in the literature is a scientific proof or just an unverified affirmation. This problem may result from the fact that there are still physiological processes that remain unclear, but also that some common beliefs are based on old studies that have not been repeated or verifiedIn addition, to make it more challenging to seek for the information, there are unverifiedaffirmations,unclear nomenclature, clinical conditions which have not been standardized in the literature, clinical conditions mostly described through case reports, lack of studies on specific topics, areas of small animal reproduction that have been neglected by researchers, contradictory data or even studies that lack objectivity.

The pandemic has shown that there is still a delay in the early response to disease outbreaks and needs a method for unknown disease outbreak detection. The study's objective is to establish a new medical knowledge representation and reasoning model, and use the model to explore the feasibility of unknown disease outbreak detection. Methods: The study defined abnormal values with diagnostic significances from clinical data as the Features, and defined the Features as the antecedents of inference rules to match with knowledge bases, achieved in detecting known or emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Meanwhile, the study built a syndromic surveillance base to capture the target cases' Features to improve the reliability and fault-tolerant ability of the system. Results: The study combined the method with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and early COVID-19 outbreaks as empirical studies. The results showed that with suitable surveillance guidelines, the method proposed in this study was capable to detect outbreaks of SARS, MERS, and early COVID-19 pandemics. The quick matching accuracies of confirmed infection cases were 89.1, 26.3–98%, and 82%, and the syndromic surveillance base would capture the Features of the remaining cases to ensure the overall detection accuracies. Based on the early COVID-19 data in Wuhan, this study estimated that the median time of the early COVID-19 cases from illness onset to local authorities' responses could be reduced to 7.0–10.0 days. Conclusions: This study offers a new solution to transfer traditional medical knowledge into structured data and form diagnosis rules, enables the representation of doctors' logistic thinking and the knowledge transmission among different users. The results of empirical studies demonstrate that by constantly inputting medical knowledge into the system, the proposed method will be capable to detect unknown diseases from existing ones and perform an early response to the initial outbreaks.","Feng, Rui; Hu, Qiping; Jiang, Yingan",Front Public Health,601,1

METHODS: A literature research was conducted on respiratory viruses and nasal congestion, following a recently published review on how temperature sensitivity is important for the success of common respiratory viruses. RESULTS: The literature reported that common respiratory viruses are temperature sensitive and replicate well at the cooler temperatures of the upper airways (32°C), but replication is restricted at body temperature (37°C). The amplitude of the phases of congestion and decongestion associated with the nasal cycle was increased on infection with respiratory viruses and this caused unilateral nasal congestion and obstruction. Nasal congestion and obstruction increase nasal mucosal temperature towards 37°C and therefore restricted the replication of respiratory viruses. CONCLUSION: Nasal congestion associated with the nasal cycle may act as a mechanism of respiratory defence against infection with respiratory viruses.","Eccles, Ronald",Clin Otolaryngol,601,1

METHODS: A total of 563 chest CT scans of 380 patients (227/380 were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia) from 5 hospitals were collected to train our deep learning (DL) model. Lung regions were extracted by U-net, then transformed and fed to pre-trained ResNet-50-based IDANNet (Identification and Analysis of New covid-19 Net) to produce a diagnostic probability. Fivefold cross-validation was employed to validate the application of our model. Another 318 scans of 316 patients (243/316 were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia) from 2 other hospitals were enrolled prospectively as the RWDs to testify our DL model’s performance and compared it with that from 3 experienced radiologists. RESULTS: A three-dimensional DL model was successfully established. The diagnostic threshold to differentiate COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia was 0.685 with an AUC of 0.906 (95% CI: 0.886–0.913) in the internal validation group. In the RWD cohort, our model achieved an AUC of 0.868 (95% CI: 0.851–0.876) with the sensitivity of 0.811 and the specificity of 0.822, non-inferior to the performance of 3 experienced radiologists, suggesting promising clinical practical usage. CONCLUSIONS: The established DL model was able to achieve accurate identification of COVID-19 pneumonia from other suspected ones in the real-world situation, which could become a reliable tool in clinical routine. KEY POINTS: • In an internal validation set, our DL model achieved the best performance to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia with a sensitivity of 0.836, a specificity of 0.800, and an AUC of 0.906 (95% CI: 0.886–0.913) when the threshold was set at 0.685. • In the prospective RWD cohort, our DL diagnostic model achieved a sensitivity of 0.811, a specificity of 0.822, and AUC of 0.868 (95% CI: 0.851–0.876), non-inferior to the performance of 3 experienced radiologists. • The attention heatmaps were fully generated by the model without additional manual annotation and the attention regions were highly aligned with the ROIs acquired by human radiologists for diagnosis.

Analysis of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S) using recombinant plasmid and virus infections demonstrated that the S-precursor (proS) exists as a ∼190 kDa endoplasmic reticulum form and a ∼210 kDa Golgi-modified form. ProS is subsequently processed into two C-terminal proteins of ∼110 and ∼80 kDa. The membrane-bound proprotein convertases (PCs) furin, PC7 or PC5B enhanced the production of the ∼80 kDa protein. In agreement, proS processing, cytopathic effects, and viral titers were enhanced in recombinant Vero E6 cells overexpressing furin, PC7 or PC5B. The convertase inhibitor dec-RVKR-cmk significantly reduced proS cleavage and viral titers of SARS-CoV infected cells. In addition, inhibition of processing by dec-RVKR-cmk completely abrogated the virus-induced cellular cytopathicity. A fluorogenically quenched synthetic peptide encompassing Arg(761) of the spike glycoprotein was efficiently cleaved by furin and the cleavage was inhibited by EDTA and dec-RVKR-cmk. Taken together, our data indicate that furin or PC-mediated processing plays a critical role in SARS-CoV spread and cytopathicity, and inhibitors of the PCs represent potential therapeutic anti-SARS-CoV agents.","Bergeron, Eric; Vincent, Martin J.; Wickham, Louise; Hamelin, Josée; Basak, Ajoy; Nichol, Stuart T.; Chrétien, Michel; Seidah, Nabil G.",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,601,18

In the absence of the structural data, the current study provides the confirmatory biophysical validation of the hypothesized “two-site” binding interactions of C5a, involving (i) the N-terminus (NT) peptide (“Site1”) and (ii) the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) peptide of the extracellular surface (ECS) of the C5aR1 (“Site2”), as illustrated earlier in the reported model structural complex of C5a–C5aR1. The biophysical and computational data elaborated in the study provides an improved understanding of the C5a–C5aR1 interaction at an atomistic resolution, highlighting the energetic importance of the aspartic acids on the NT-peptide of C5aR1 toward binding of C5a.

Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) may be particularly useful for survivors of IPV for several reasons, including barriers pertaining to limited community recourses and treatment availability, safety concerns, and issues of stigma, guilt and shame, which may prevent members of this population from seeking help via face-to-face interactions. However, Internet interventions are lacking. The primary aim of the present randomized controlled pilot trial was to explore the feasibility of ICBT as guided self-help individually tailored to the predominant symptomatology of PTSD or depression in survivors of IPV. A second aim was to conduct a preliminary evaluation exploring the short- and long-term effects of the treatment in comparison to a waitlist control condition. Results showed that the treatment was feasible. Attrition rate was low (9.4%), and participants were satisfied with treatment. However, treatment adherence was moderate in terms of completed modules (62.5%). Results of the preliminary evaluation of treatment effects showed large and statistically significant between-group effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.86–1.08) on some measures of PTSD and depression at post assessment, favoring the treatment condition. However, there were no effects on other measures. At follow-up assessment, when the control condition had received delayed treatment, there were large and statistically significant within-group effect sizes (d = 0.96–1.48) on measures of PTSD, depression and anxiety, and small effects (d = 0.48) on a measure of quality of life. The results of the present pilot study are promising and warrant further research on ICBT for this population.","Andersson, Gerhard; Olsson, Elin; Ringsgård, Emma; Sandgren, Therese; Viklund, Ida; Andersson, Catja; Hesselman, Ylva; Johansson, Robert; Nordgren, Lise Bergman; Bohman, Benjamin",Internet Interv,601,14

We have used the MIQE guidelines to develop two versions of a unique five plex RT-qPCR test, termed CoV2-ID, that allows the detection of three viral target genes, a human internal control for confirming the presence of human cells in a sample and a control artificial RNA for quality assessment and potential quantification. Viral targets can be detected either individually with separate fluorophores or jointly using the same fluorophore, thus increasing the test’s reliability and sensitivity. It is robust, can consistently detect two copies of viral RNA, with a limit of detection of a single copy and can be completed in around 15 min. It was 100% sensitive and 100% specific when tested on 23 RNA samples extracted from COVID-19 positive patients and five COVID-19 negative patients.

We examined three different, commonly used approaches to stress relaxation—progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, and guided imagery—and evaluated them in a head-to-head comparison against each other and a control condition. Sixty healthy undergraduate participants were randomized to one of the four conditions and completed 20 minutes of progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, or guided imagery training that was delivered by recorded audio instruction. Baseline and follow-up assessment of psychological relaxation states were completed. Physiological relaxation was also assessed continuously using measures of electrodermal activity and heart rate. Results showed that progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, and guided imagery all increased the state of relaxation for participants in those groups, compared to participants in the control group. In each case, the increase was statistically significant and although the groups did not differ on relaxation before training, all groups were significantly higher on relaxation after training, as compared to the control group. Progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery showed an immediate linear trend toward physiological relaxation, compared to the control group, and the deep breathing group showed an immediate increase in physiological arousal followed quickly by a return to initial levels. Our results lend support to the body of research showing that stress relaxation training can be effective in improving relaxation states at both the psychological and physiological level. Future research could examine stress relaxation techniques in a similar manner using designs where multiple techniques can be compared in the same samples.","Toussaint, Loren; Nguyen, Quang Anh; Roettger, Claire; Dixon, Kiara; Offenbächer, Martin; Kohls, Niko; Hirsch, Jameson; Sirois, Fuschia",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,601,16

Chronic disease care has also changed for many patients, with uncertain downstream consequences. OBJECTIVE: Assess whether COVID-19 risk is higher among those on immunomodulating or suppressive agents and characterize pandemic-associated changes to care. DESIGN: Longitudinal registry study PARTICIPANTS: 4666 individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions followed by specialists in neurology, rheumatology, cardiology, pulmonology or gastroenterology at Johns Hopkins MEASUREMENTS: Periodic surveys querying comorbidities, disease-modifying medications, exposures, COVID-19 testing and outcomes, social behaviors, and disruptions to healthcare RESULTS: A total of 265 (5.6%) developed COVID-19 over 9 months of follow-up (April-December 2020). Patient characteristics (age, race, comorbidity, medication exposure) were associated with differences in social distancing behaviors during the pandemic. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 in multivariable models incorporating behavior and other potential confounders (OR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.08, 1.89). Other medication classes were not associated with COVID-19 risk. Diabetes (OR: 1.72; 95%CI: 1.08, 2.73), cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.24, 2.28), and chronic kidney disease (OR: 1.76; 95%CI: 1.04, 2.97) were each associated with higher odds of COVID-19.

We initiated this randomized phase III trial to determine whether a cyclophosphamide-free adjuvant chemotherapy regimen would increase the likelihood of menses resumption and improve survival outcomes. METHODS: Young women with operable estrogen receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer after definitive surgery were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant epirubicin and cyclophosphamidefollowed by weekly paclitaxel (EC-wP) or epirubicin and paclitaxel followed by weekly paclitaxel (EP-wP). All patients received at least 5-year adjuvant endocrine therapy after chemotherapy. Two coprimary endpoints were the rate of menstrual resumption at 12 months after chemotherapy and 5-year disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01026116). All statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: Between January 2011 and December 2016, 521 patients (median age = 34 years; interquartile range = 31-38 years) were enrolled, with 261 in the EC-wP group and 260 in the EP-wP group. The rate of menstrual resumption at 12 months after chemotherapy was 48.3% in EC-wP (95% confidence interval [CI] = 42.2% to 54.3%) and 63.1% in EP-wP (95% CI = 57.2% to 68.9%), with an absolute difference of 14.8% (95% CI = 6.37% to 23.2%, P < .001). The posthoc exploratory analysis by patient-reported outcome questionnaires indicated that pregnancy might occur in fewer women in the EC-wP group than in the EP-wP group. At a median follow-up of 62 months, the 5-year disease-free survival was 78.3% (95% CI = 72.2% to 83.3%) in EC-wP and 84.7% (95% CI = 79.3% to 88.8%) in EP-wP (stratified log-rank P = .07). The safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of relevant drugs.

Therefore, studying food waste utilization potentials and minimizing its negative consequences becomes imperative. This study aims to assess the technical and economic potentials of substituting corn with unconventional extruded dried Arabic Bread waste (EDABW) in broilers’ diets, in terms of broilers’ performance, carcass characteristic, economic net returns, and income over feed cost (IOFC). One hundred eighty unsexed one-day-old broiler birds of Ross breed were distributed randomly in six treatments (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% EDABW group) of isocaloric and isonitrogenous diets in a completely randomized design with six replicated (5 chicks/replicate). The investigated traits were broilers’ performance (live body weight, total feed intake, total feed conversion ratio, and total weight gain. Other traits such as carcass weight, abdominal fat, edible offal (liver, heart, and gizzard), eviscerated (breast muscles, drum and thigh muscles, and wings) were weighed and expressed based on a live body weight. Results showed that the 20 % replacement level of corn with EDABW generated the highest increase in the live body weight and the eviscerated carcass at about 4.24% g and 4.90%, respectively. On the other hand, the economic analysis showed potential reductions in the broilers’ diet cost and the total broilers' production cost as the levels of corn substitution with by unconventional EDABW increased. The reductions were estimated at 5.1%, 6.3%, 8.4%, 9.3%, and 9.9% at substitution levels of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%, respectively as compared to the control diet. The results also showed a potential increase in the net economic returns of broiler meat as the increase in substitution levels ranged between 3.5–6.8% and 4.3–8.3% as compared to the control diets using the average retail and wholesale prices of broiler meats, respectively. In addition, the maximum IOFC was estimated potentially at a 20% substitution level of corn with EDABW. Conclusively, the study results show promising technical and economic potentials for unconventional EDABW in broilers’ diets that could lead to a thriving industry of unconventional broilers’ diets with high net economic returns and maximum IOFC.","AL Sagan, Ahmed A.; Al-Abdulkader, Ahmed M.; Al-Dakhil, Abdullah I.; Shady, Khalil; Al-Khuraish, Muteb M.",Saudi J Biol Sci,601,16

Their close contacts had mild to severe symptoms and three of them died. In the SARS-CoV-2 infection different inflammatory pathways are altered where colchicine reduces cytokine levels as well as the activation of macrophages, neutrophils, and the inflammasome. The possible mechanisms that colchicine may use to prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with COVID-19 infection are also reviewed in this article.","Montealegre-Gómez, Giovanni; Garavito, Edgar; Gómez-López, Arley; Rojas-Villarraga, Adriana; Parra-Medina, Rafael",Reumatol Clin (Engl Ed),601,16

In Germany, AgeWell.de is the first large-scale initiative investigating the effectiveness of a multi-component lifestyle intervention against cognitive decline. We aimed to investigate the recruitment process and baseline characteristics of the AgeWell.de participants to gain an understanding of the at-risk population and who engages in the intervention. General practitioners across five study sites recruited participants (aged 60–77 years, Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia/CAIDE dementia risk score ≥ 9). Structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with eligible participants, including neuropsychological assessments. We analyzed group differences between (1) eligible vs. non-eligible participants, (2) participants vs. non-participants, and (3) between intervention groups. Of 1176 eligible participants, 146 (12.5%) dropped out before baseline; the study population was thus 1030 individuals. Non-participants did not differ from participants in key sociodemographic factors and dementia risk. Study participants were M = 69.0 (SD = 4.9) years old, and 52.1% were women. The average Montreal Cognitive Assessment/MoCA score was 24.5 (SD = 3.1), indicating a rather mildly cognitively impaired study population; however, 39.4% scored ≥ 26, thus being cognitively unimpaired. The bandwidth of cognitive states bears the interesting potential for differential trial outcome analyses. However, trial conduction is impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring adjustments to the study protocol with yet unclear methodological consequences.","Röhr, Susanne; Zülke, Andrea; Luppa, Melanie; Brettschneider, Christian; Weißenborn, Marina; Kühne, Flora; Zöllinger, Isabel; Samos, Franziska-Antonia Zora; Bauer, Alexander; Döhring, Juliane; Krebs-Hein, Kerstin; Oey, Anke; Czock, David; Frese, Thomas; Gensichen, Jochen; Haefeli, Walter E.; Hoffmann, Wolfgang; Kaduszkiewicz, Hanna; König, Hans-Helmut; Thyrian, Jochen René; Wiese, Birgitt; Riedel-Heller, Steffi G.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,601,32

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study in a general ICU in Brazil. A secondary analysis was performed with clinical and epidemiological data, present in the first 24 hours of unit admission. Then, a binary logistic regression, followed by cross-validation, was made to develop a novel prognostic tool. ICU mortality was the primary outcome evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 3042 patients were included over the study period between August 2015 and July 2018 with a median age of 67 ± 18.4 years. SAPS3 performed fairly in prediction of ICU mortality, particularly in the 80 years or older subset. Multivariable regression identified variables independently associated with mortality that were used to develop the Age Calibrated ICU Score (ACIS) tool that performed similarly to SAPS3 across age categories, being slightly superior in the very elderly population (AUC 0.80 vs 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: The ACIS offers a robust and simple tool to predict ICU mortality, particularly in an increasingly elderly critical care population.","Menezes, Rodrigo C.; Ferreira, Isabella B.

Activation of these cells results in the production of various mediators responsible for inflammation and RA pathogenesis. On the other hand, the depletion of macrophages using specific antibodies or chemical agents can prevent their synovial tissue infiltration and subsequently attenuates inflammation. Their plasticity is a major feature that helps the switch from a pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1) to an anti-inflammatory state (M2). Therefore, understanding the precise strategy targeting pro-inflammatory monocytes/macrophages should be a powerful way of inhibiting chronic inflammation and bone erosion. In this review, we demonstrate potential consequences of different epigenetic regulations on inflammatory cytokines production by monocytes. In addition, we present unique profiles of monocytes/macrophages contributing to identification of new biomarkers of disease activity or predicting treatment response in RA. We also outline novel approaches of tuning monocytes/macrophages by biologic drugs, small molecules or by other therapeutic modalities to reduce arthritis. Finally, the importance of cellular heterogeneity of monocytes/macrophages is highlighted by single-cell technologies, which leads to the design of cell-specific therapeutic protocols for personalized medicine in RA in the future.","Roszkowski, Leszek; Ciechomska, Marzena",Cells,601,3

We hypothesized that patient outcomes would be improved at our tertiary cardiothoracic surgery referral center with a protocolized team-approach for ECMO treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old healthy female developed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) bilateral pneumonia while vacationing in Colorado with her family. She was transferred to our facility for a higher level of care. Her respiratory status continued to deteriorate despite maximized critical care, including prone positioning ventilation and nitric oxide inhalation therapy.

In addition, a systemic prothrombotic phenotype has been reported in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 62 subjects were included in our study (n=38 patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction–confirmed COVID-19 and n=24 non–COVID-19 controls). We performed histopathologic assessment of autopsy cases, surface marker–based phenotyping of neutrophils and platelets, and functional assays for platelet, neutrophil functions, and coagulation tests, as well. RESULTS: We provide evidence that organ involvement and prothrombotic features in COVID-19 are linked by immunothrombosis. We show that, in COVID-19, inflammatory microvascular thrombi are present in the lung, kidney, and heart, containing neutrophil extracellular traps associated with platelets and fibrin. Patients with COVID-19 also present with neutrophil-platelet aggregates and a distinct neutrophil and platelet activation pattern in blood, which changes with disease severity. Whereas cases of intermediate severity show an exhausted platelet and hyporeactive neutrophil phenotype, patients severely affected with COVID-19 are characterized by excessive platelet and neutrophil activation in comparison with healthy controls and non–COVID-19 pneumonia. Dysregulated immunothrombosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 pneumonia is linked to both acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic hypercoagulability.

All three suffered from respiratory failure, were treated with veno-venous or veno-arterial-venous ECMO, and experienced RPH during ECMO treatment. Two of the COVID-19 cases were diagnosed after the patients experienced abdominal pain. The other patient exhibited decreases in the ECMO circuit flow rate and hemoglobin level. Two cases were treated by transcatheter arterial embolization, and one was treated conservatively. The hemorrhage in each of the three cases did not deteriorate. Satisfactory treatment results were achieved for the three patients because of prompt diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSION: Although the incidence of RPH during ECMO treatment is low, the risk is increased by anticoagulant use and local mechanical injury.

Multiple lifestyle factors are known to influence the immune function. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the association between NK cell activity (NKA) and multiple factors including vitamin D, physical exercise, age, and gender. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional association study using health check-up and NKA data of 2,095 subjects collected from 2016 to 2018 in a health check-up center in the Republic of Korea. NKA was measured using the interferon-γ (IFN-γ) stimulation method. The association of NKA with 25-(OH)-vitamin D (25(OH)D) and other factors was investigated by multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The average age of subjects was 48.8 ± 11.6 years (52.9% of subjects were female). Among 2,095 subjects, 1,427 had normal NKA (NKA ≥ 500 pg IFN-γ/mL), while 506 had low NKA (100 ≤ NKA < 500 pg/mL), and 162 subjects had very low NKA (NKA < 100 pg/mL). Compared to men with low 25(OH)D serum level (< 20 ng/mL), vitamin D replete men (30–39.9 ng/mL) had significantly lower risk of very low NKA (OR: 0.358; 95% CI: 0.138, 0.929; P = 0.035). In women, both low exercise (OR: 0.529; 95% CI: 0.299, 0.939; P = 0.030) and medium to high exercise (OR: 0.522; 95% CI: 0.277, 0.981; P = 0.043) decreased the risk compared to lack of physical exercise. Interestingly, in men and women older than 60 years, physical exercise significantly decreased the risk. Older-age was associated with increased risk of very low NKA in men, but not in women. CONCLUSION: Physical exercise and vitamin D were associated with NKA in a gender- and age-dependent manner. Age was a major risk factor of very low NKA in men but not in women.","Oh, Sooyeon; Chun, Sukyung; Hwang, Sena; Kim, Jongseok; Cho, Yuri; Lee, Jooho; Kwack, KyuBum; Choi, Sang-Woon",Front Immunol,601,1

Hospital systems saw a dramatic decline in patient volumes both in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Surveying our center's heart failure (HF) clinic population, we aimed to better understand our patients’ perception of COVID19, their fears, and care delivery preferences in this new era. Methods Consecutive patients with chronic HF presenting to our clinic either in person or virtually were approached to complete a ten question Likert scale survey (Table 1). Acutely decompensated patients and heart transplant recipients were excluded. The survey was anonymous and voluntary. Results 109 patients completed the survey. The average age was 62±14 years, 73 (67%) were male and 64 (59%) had a diagnosis of HF with reduced ejection fraction. Overall, our patients were afraid of contracting COVID19 and getting sicker given their underlying cardiac condition but were not hesitant to call the clinic or come to the emergency department with worsening HF symptoms. Patients responded that virtual appointments are less preferable and less effective than in-person visits. Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, female patients and those with HF with preserved ejection fraction were more concerned. Conclusion Overall, patients with HF are concerned about their increased risk of contracting COVID19. However, they are not likely to avoid healthcare contact and preferred in-person over virtual visits.","Fraser, M.; Mutschler, M.; Newman, C.; Sackman, K.; Mehdi, B.; Martin, C.

However, the development of PEDV vaccine is hampered by its low propagation titer in vitro, due to difficulty in adapting to the cells and complex culture conditions, even in the presence of trypsin. Furthermore, the frequent variation, recombination, and evolution of PEDV resulted in reemergence and vaccination failure. In this study, we established the Vero/TMPRSS2 and Vero/MSPL cell lines, constitutively expressing type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 and MSPL, in order to increase the stability and titer of PEDV culture and isolation in vitro. Our study revealed that the Vero/TMPRSS2, especially Vero/MSPL cell lines, can effectively facilitate the titer and multicycle replication of cell-adapted PEDV in the absence of exogenous trypsin, by cleaving and activating PEDV S protein. Furthermore, our results also highlighted that Vero/TMPRSS2 and Vero/MSPL cells can significantly enhance the isolation of PEDV from the clinical tissue samples as well as promote viral infection and replication by cell-cell fusion. The successful construction of the Vero/TMPRSS2 and Vero/MSPL cell lines provides a useful approach for the isolation and propagation of PEDV, simplification of virus culture, and large-scale production of industrial vaccine, and the cell lines are also an important system to research PEDV S protein cleaved by host protease.","Wang, Xiaona; Qiao, Xinyuan; Sui, Ling; Zhao, Haiyuan; Li, Fengsai; Tang, Yan-Dong; Shi, Wen; Guo, Yuyao; Jiang, Yanping; Wang, Li; Zhou, Han; Tang, Lijie; Xu, Yigang; Li, Yijing",Virulence,601,16

These disposable devices are generally not approved for routine decontamination and re-use as standard of care while this practice has widely occurred in hospitals. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allowed it “as a crisis capacity strategy.” However, limited testing was conducted on the impact of specific decontamination methods on the performance of N95 FFRs and no data was presented for surgical masks. AIM: We evaluated common surgical masks and N95 respirators with respect to the changes in their performance and integrity resulting from autoclave sterilization and a 70% ethanol treatment; these methods are frequently utilized for re-used filtering facepieces in hospitals. METHODS: The filter collection efficiency and pressure drop were determined for unused masks and N95 FFRs, and for those subjected to the treatments in a variety of ways. The collection efficiency was measured for particles of approximately 0.037–3.2 μm to represent aerosolized single viruses, their agglomerates, bacteria and larger particles carriers. FINDINGS: The initial collection efficiency and the filter breathability may be compromised by sterilization in an autoclave and ethanol treatment. The effect depends on a protective device, particle size, breathing flow rate, type of treatment and other factors. Additionally, physical damages were observed in N95 respirators after autoclaving.

However, there is a scarcity of literature that investigates the readership characteristics of open-access medical news sites and how these characteristics may have shifted during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess readership and survey data to characterize open-access medical news readership trends related to the COVID-19 pandemic and overall readership trends regarding pandemic-related information delivery. METHODS: Anonymous, aggregate readership data were obtained from 2 Minute Medicine, an open-access, physician-run medical news organization that has published over 8000 original, physician-written texts and visual summaries of new medical research since 2013. In this retrospective observational study, the average number of article views, number of actions (defined as the sum of the number of views, shares, and outbound link clicks), read times, and bounce rates (probability of leaving a page in <30 s) were compared between COVID-19 articles published from January 1 to May 31, 2020 (n=40) and non–COVID-19 articles (n=145) published in the same time period. A voluntary survey was also sent to subscribed 2 Minute Medicine readers to further characterize readership demographics and preferences, which were scored on a Likert scale. RESULTS: COVID-19 articles had a significantly higher median number of views than non–COVID-19 articles (296 vs 110; U=748.5; P<.001). There were no significant differences in average read times (P=.12) or bounce rates (P=.12). Non–COVID-19 articles had a higher median number of actions than COVID-19 articles (2.9 vs 2.5; U=2070.5; P=.02). On a Likert scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), our survey data revealed that 65.5% (78/119) of readers agreed or strongly agreed that they preferred staying up to date with emerging literature about COVID-19 by using sources such as 2 Minute Medicine instead of journals. A greater proportion of survey respondents also indicated that open-access news sources were one of their primary sources for staying informed (86/120, 71.7%) compared to the proportion who preferred direct journal article access (61/120, 50.8%). The proportion of readers indicating they were reading one or less full-length medical studies a month were lower following introduction to 2 Minute Medicine compared to prior (21/120, 17.5% vs 38/120, 31.6%; P=.005). CONCLUSIONS: The readership significantly increased for one open-access medical literature platform during the pandemic. This reinforces the idea that open-access, physician-written sources of medical news represent an important alternative to direct journal access for readers who want to stay up to date with medical literature.","Chan, Alex K; Wu, Constance; Cheung, Andrew; Succi, Marc D",J Med Internet Res,601,24

Currently, there is no consensus on whether the antibodies, if present, are protective. Our regular measurements of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, starting in July 2020, have provided us with the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the five different immunoassays. A total of 149 patients were enrolled in our study. We measured the samples using each immunoassay, then performing a virus neutralization test and comparing the results of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with this test. We observed that the production of neutralizing antibodies is age-dependent. Elderly patients have a higher proportion of high neutralizing titers than young patients. Based on our results, and in combination with the literature findings, we can conclude that the serological SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurement is a helpful tool in the fight against COVID-19. The assays can provide information about the patient’s previous contact with the virus. Anti-spike protein assays correlate well with the virus neutralization test and can be used in the screening of potential convalescent plasma donors.","Šimánek, Václav; Pecen, Ladislav; Krátká, Zuzana; Fürst, Tomáš; Řezáčková, Hana; Topolčan, Ondřej; Fajfrlík, Karel; Sedláček, Dalibor; Šín, Robin; Pazdiora, Petr; Zelená, Hana; Slouka, David; Kučera, Radek",Diagnostics (Basel),601,22

Various measures such as quarantine and social distancing have been taken to prevent the spread of this disease. These prevention measures have changed the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and introduced new challenges for epidemic modelling and prediction. In this paper, we study a novel disease spreading model with two important aspects. First, the proposed model takes the quarantine effect of confirmed cases on transmission dynamics into account, which can better resemble the real-world scenario. Second, our model incorporates two types of human mobility, where the intra-region human mobility is related to the internal transmission speed of the disease in the focal area and the inter-region human mobility reflects the scale of external infectious sources to a focal area. With the proposed model, we use the human mobility data from 24 cities in China and 8 states in the USA to analyse the disease spreading patterns. The results show that our model could well fit/predict the reported cases in both countries. The predictions and findings shed light on how to effectively control COVID-19 by managing human mobility behaviours.","Du, Bowen; Zhao, Zirong; Zhao, Jiejie; Yu, Le; Sun, Leilei; Lv, Weifeng",Int J Data Sci Anal,601,24

We retrospectively analyzed the response of 100 emergency departments regarding use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and implementation of infection control measures (ICMs) during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Taiwan. Emergency department workers in large hospitals were more severely affected by the epidemic. Large hospitals or public hospitals were more likely to use respirators. Small hospitals implemented more restrictive ICMs. Most emergency departments provided PPE (80%) and implemented ICMs (66%) at late stages of the outbreak. Instructions to use PPE or ICMs more frequently originated by emergency department administrators. The difficulty of implementing ICMs was significantly negatively correlated with their effectiveness. Because ability to prepare for and respond to emerging infectious diseases varies among hospitals, grouping infectious patients in a centralized location in an early stage of infection may reduce the extent of epidemics.","Chen, Wei-Kung; Wu, Hong-Dar Isaac; Lin, Cheng-Chieh; Cheng, Yi-Chang",Emerg Infect Dis,601,16

Results indicated that, frequency rates of these 11 variations change between 3.56%–88.44 % and these rates differ greatly depending on the continents they have been reported. Despite some variations being in low frequency rate in some continents, C14408T and A23403G variations on Nsp12 and S protein, respectively, observed to be the most prominent variations all over the world, in general, and both cause missense mutations. It is also notable that most of isolates carry C14408T and A23403 variations simultaneously and also nearly all isolates carrying the G25563T variation on ORF3a, also carry C14408T and A23403 variations, although their location distributions are not similar.

However, the immunogenic potential and efficiency of exosomes-based tumor vaccine are not satisfactory enough to achieve a curative effect in clinical trials. In this article we investigated whether IL-18 genetic modification of tumor cells can increase the efficacy of exosomes derived from IL-18 gene-modified tumor cells. We transfected carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-expressing tumor cells with a recombinant adenovirus encoding human IL-18 (AdhIL-18) and prepared the exosomes, Exo/IL-18, from IL-18 gene-modified tumor cells. We found that Exo/IL-18 naturally contain CEA and bioactive IL-18. Moreover, Exo-IL-18 are potent in chemoattracting DC and T cells, enhancing the proliferation and Th1 cytokine release of PBMC, and promoting the phenotypic and functional maturation of DC. Furthermore, Exo/IL-18-pulsed DC are quite potent to induce HLA-A*0201-restricted, CEA-specific CD8(+) CTL from the PBMC of HLA-A*0201 CEA(+) cancer patients in vitro. In almost all of these experiments, Exo/IL-18 show more potent functions than the conventionally prepared exosomes derived from parent tumor cells without IL-18 gene modification. Our findings suggest that Exo/IL-18 has more potent capability to induce specific anti-tumor immunity, and our strategy of IL-18 modification of exosomes is a feasible approach to develop exosomes-based tumor vaccines.","Dai, Shengming; Zhou, Xiangyang; Wang, Baomei; Wang, Qingqing; Fu, Yangxin; Chen, Taoyong; Wan, Tao; Yu, Yizhi; Cao, Xuetao",J Mol Med (Berl),601,16

We previously reported increased bronchial mucosa eosinophil and neutrophil inflammation in COPD experiencing naturally occurring exacerbations. But it is unclear whether virus per se induces bronchial mucosal inflammation, nor whether this relates to exacerbation severity. Objectives To determine the extent and nature of bronchial mucosal inflammation following experimental rhinovirus (RV)-16-induced COPD exacerbations and its relationship to disease severity. Methods Bronchial mucosal inflammatory cell phenotypes were determined at pre-infection baseline and following experimental RV infection in 17 GOLD stage II COPD subjects and as controls, 20 smokers and 11 non-smokers, with normal lung function. No subject had a history of asthma/allergic rhinitis: all were negative for aero-allergen skin prick tests. Results RV-infection increased the numbers of bronchial mucosal eosinophils and neutrophils only in COPD and CD8+ T-lymphocytes in COPD and non-smokers. Monocytes/macrophages, CD4+ T- and CD20+ B-lymphocytes were increased in all subjects. At baseline, compared to non-smokers, COPD subjects and smokers had increased numbers of bronchial mucosal monocytes/macrophages and CD8+ T-lymphocytes but fewer numbers of CD4+ T- and CD20+ B-lymphocytes. The virus-induced inflammatory cells in COPD were positively associated with virus load, illness severity and reductions in lung function. Conclusion Experimental rhinovirus infection induces bronchial mucosal eosinophilia and neutrophilia only in COPD and monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes in both COPD and control subjects. The virus-induced inflammatory cell phenotypes observed in COPD positively related to virus load, illness severity. Anti-viral/anti-inflammatory therapies could attenuate bronchial inflammation and ameliorate virus-induced COPD exacerbations.","Zhu, Jie; Mallia, Patrick; Footitt, Joseph; Qiu, Yusheng; Message, Simon D.; Kebadze, Tatiana; Aniscenko, Julia.; Barnes, Peter.J.; Adcock, Ian M.; Kon, Onn M.; Johnson, Malcolm; Contoli, Marco; Stanciu, Luminita A.; Papi, Alberto; Jeffery, Peter K.; Johnston, Sebastian L.",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,601,20

Highest levels of mRNA of canine STING were detected in the spleen and lungs while the lowest levels in the heart and muscle. Analysis of its cellular localization showed that STING is localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. STING overexpression induced the IFN response via the IRF3 and NF-κB pathways and up-regulated the expression of ISG15 and viperin. However, knockdown of STING did not inhibit the IFN-β response triggered by poly(dA:dT), poly(I:C), or SeV.

These proteins recognize a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within cargo proteins and import them into the nucleus through nuclear pores, in a process mediated by importin-β. Recent studies have shown that importin-α proteins specifically recognize the NLS of several cellular factors and viral proteins, thus regulating their movement. Dysregulation of importin-α is a common hallmark of many pathologies including, multiple cancers. In this study, we isolated aptamers 76 and 72, which bind specifically and efficiently to KPNA2, a member of a subfamily of importin-α1. Both of these aptamers bind to KPNA2 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) of 150 nM and discriminate between KPNA2 and other sub-family members of importin-α, such as KPNA1 and KPNA3. These aptamers specifically interfere with the nuclear transport of cargo proteins mediated by KPNA2 but neither with KPNA1 nor KPNA3, which belongs to other subfamily of importins. These results suggest that the selected aptamers (76 and 72) warrant further study to explore not only their application in cancer diagnosis but also their use as a specific reagent to potentially block KPNA2-dependent nuclear transport of macromolecules across the nuclear membrane.","Yasuhara, Noriko; Kumar, Penmetcha K.R.",J Biochem,601,18

This short paper discusses another way of looking at the spread of COVID-19, by focusing on the daily rate of infection, defined as the daily rate of increase in the number of infected persons. It is shown that the daily rate is monotonically decreasing, after a short initial period, in all countries, and that the pattern is similar in all countries.

Data of demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory tests, medications and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Sequential alterations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were monitored. RESULTS: 330 patients were included and classified into two groups with normal (n=234) or elevated ALT (n=96). There were fewer females (40.6% vs 54.7%, P=0.020) and more critical cases (30.2% vs. 19.2%, P=0.026) in patients with elevated ALT compared to the normal group. Higher levels of bacterial infection indices (e.g. white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C‐reactive protein and procalcitonin) were observed in the elevated group. Spearman correlation showed that both ALT and AST levels were positively correlated with those indices of bacterial infection. No obvious effects of medications on ALT abnormalities were found. In patients with elevated ALT, most ALT elevations were mild and transient. 59.4% of the patients had ALT concentrations of 41–100 U/L, while only a few patients (5.2%) had high serum ALT concentrations above 300 U/L. ALT elevations occurred at 13 (10–17) days and recovered at 28 (18–35) days from disease onset. For most patients, the elevation of serum ALT levels occurred at 6–20 days after disease onset and reached their peak values within a similar time frame. The recovery of serum ALT levels to normal frequently occurred at 16–20 days or 31–35 days after disease onset. CONCLUSIONS: Liver function abnormalities were observed in 29.1% of the elderly COVID‐19 patients, which were slightly and transient in most cases.

Like parental viruses, VLPs can be either non-enveloped or enveloped, and they can form following expression of one or several viral structural proteins in a recombinant heterologous system. Depending on the complexity of the VLP, it can be produced in either a prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression system using target-encoding recombinant vectors, or in some cases can be assembled in cell-free conditions. To date, a wide variety of VLP-based candidate vaccines targeting various viral, bacterial, parasitic and fungal pathogens, as well as non-infectious diseases, have been produced in different expression systems. Some VLPs have entered clinical development and a few have been licensed and commercialized. This article reviews VLP-based vaccines produced in different systems, their immunogenicity in animal models and their status in clinical development.","Kushnir, Natasha; Streatfield, Stephen J.; Yusibov, Vidadi",Vaccine,601,1

We described the results of 57 consecutive COVID-19 patients seen at FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from April to May 2020. Data about the presence of smell loss, the onset of smell loss and other COVID-19 symptoms such as ageusia and nasal congestion or rhinorrhea were recorded. All patients at the initial consultation and 34 healthy controls underwent the Q-SIT, which is a quick disposable three-item smell identification test, by a trained physician. We compared three groups: healthy controls, COVID+ patients with reported smell loss (COVID w/ SL) and COVID+ patients without smell loss (COVID+ w/o SL). The mean age of patients was 41.4 years (SD ± 10.4), and 54.4% were women. Smell loss was reported by 40.4% of COVID-19 patients. We observed a gradual effect with higher Q-SIT scores in healthy controls, followed by COVID+ w/o SL and COVID+ w/ SL (medians = 3, 2 and 0; respectively, p < 0.001). Anosmia or severe microsmia (Q-SIT≤1) was present in 11.1% (CI: 3.1%–26.1%) of controls, 32.4% (CI: 17.4%–50.5%) of COVID-19 w/o SL and 87% (CI: 66.4%–97.2%) of COVID+ w/ SL (p < 0.001).

However, interpreting estimates based on sero-surveillance requires an understanding of the duration of elevated antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the large number of people with pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. Methods: We examined >30,000 serology assays for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM assays acquired longitudinally in 11,468 adults between April and November 2020 in the COVID-19 Community Research Partnership. Findings: Among participants with serologic evidence for infection but few or no symptoms or clinical disease, roughly 50% sero-reverted in 30 days of their initial positive test. Sero-reversion occurred more quickly for IgM than IgG and for antibodies targeting nucleocapsid protein compared with spike proteins, but was not associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, or healthcare worker status. Interpretation: The short duration of antibody response suggests that the true population prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection may be significantly higher than presumed based on earlier sero-surveillance studies. The impact of the large number of minimally symptomatic COVID-19 cases with only a brief antibody response on population immunity remains to be determined.","Herrington, D.

BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 pandemic brought challenging times for nurses worldwide. In Brazil, as well as in several countries, nurses are working hard in hospital settings caring for patients infected with the virus, sometimes with unfavourable work environment conditions. METHODS: This study was a convergent embedded mixed methods research. The sample comprised 104 nurses from three Brazilian university hospitals. Data were collected in April–June 2020 from an online questionnaire with a self‐reporting Likert scale survey designed to measure the nurses' perceptions of their work environment. Qualitative data in the form of written comments were also collected through an open question. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. RESULTS: The quantitative results showed that the responses to ‘I received training on the correct use of personal protective equipment’ and ‘I am afraid of being infected’ items had the best and worst evaluations, respectively. The qualitative findings revealed five themes: feeling of insecurity, lack of personal protective equipment, lack of diagnostic tests, changes in the care flow and fear of the unknown. CONCLUSION: The study has highlighted the challenges faced by hospital nurses while caring for patients with COVID‐19. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND NURSING POLICY: The gaps identified will assist the policymakers and hospital managers in developing policies to enhance the support offered to nurses and improve the care provided to patients with COVID‐19 in university hospitals. The results also indicate the need for attention to the mental health of the professionals due to the increasing workload and treatment of an illness hitherto unknown.","dos Santos, José Luís Guedes; Balsanelli, Alexandre Pazetto; Freitas, Etiane de Oliveira; Menegon, Fernando Henrique Antunes; Carneiro, Ieda Aparecida; Lazzari, Daniele Delacanal; Menezes, Jennifer Aguilar Leocádio De; Erdmann, Alacoque Lorenzini; Camponogara, Silviamar",Int Nurs Rev,601,1

The surge mitigation is complicated and associates many factors, including the pandemic status, policy, socioeconomics and resident behaviours. Modelling and analytics with spatial-temporal big urban data are required to assist the mitigation of the pandemic. This study proposes a novel perspective to analyse the spatial-temporal potential exposure risk of residents by capturing human behaviours based on spatial-temporal car park availability data. Near real-time data from 1,904 residential car parks in Singapore, a classical megacity, are collected to analyse car mobility and its spatial-temporal heat map. The implementation of the circuit breaker, a COVID-19 measure, in Singapore has reduced the mobility and heat (daily frequency of mobility) significantly at about 30.0 %. It contributes to a 44.3 % to 55.4 % reduction in the transportation-related air emissions under two scenarios of travelling distance reductions. Urban sustainability impacts in both environment and economy are discussed. The spatial-temporal potential exposure risk mapping with space-time interactions is further investigated via an extended Bayesian spatial-temporal regression model. The maximal reduction rate of the defined potential exposure risk lowers to 37.6 % by comparison with its peak value. The big data analytics of changes in car mobility behaviour and the resultant potential exposure risks can provide insights to assist in (a) designing a flexible circuit breaker exit strategy, (b) precise management via identifying and tracing hotspots on the mobility heat map, and (c) making timely decisions by fitting curves dynamically in different phases of COVID-19 mitigation. The proposed method has the potential to be used by decision-makers worldwide with available data to make flexible regulations and planning.","Jiang, Peng; Fu, Xiuju; Van Fan, Yee; Klemeš, Jiří Jaromír; Chen, Piao; Ma, Stefan; Zhang, Wanbing",J Clean Prod,601,8

We conducted a randomized crossover trial to determine whether a 12-week modified ketogenic diet improved cognition, daily function, or quality of life in a hospital clinic of AD patients. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with clinically confirmed diagnoses of AD to a modified ketogenic diet or usual diet supplemented with low-fat healthy-eating guidelines and enrolled them in a single-phase, assessor-blinded, two-period crossover trial (two 12-week treatment periods, separated by a 10-week washout period). Primary outcomes were mean within-individual changes in the Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination - III (ACE-III) scale, AD Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) inventory, and Quality of Life in AD (QOL-AD) questionnaire over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes considered changes in cardiovascular risk factors and adverse effects. RESULTS: We randomized 26 patients, of whom 21 (81%) completed the ketogenic diet; only one withdrawal was attributed to the ketogenic diet. While on the ketogenic diet, patients achieved sustained physiological ketosis (12-week mean beta-hydroxybutyrate level: 0.95 ± 0.34 mmol/L). Compared with usual diet, patients on the ketogenic diet increased their mean within-individual ADCS-ADL (+ 3.13 ± 5.01 points, P = 0.0067) and QOL-AD (+ 3.37 ± 6.86 points, P = 0.023) scores; the ACE-III also increased, but not significantly (+ 2.12 ± 8.70 points, P = 0.24). Changes in cardiovascular risk factors were mostly favourable, and adverse effects were mild. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized trial to investigate the impact of a ketogenic diet in patients with uniform diagnoses of AD. High rates of retention, adherence, and safety appear to be achievable in applying a 12-week modified ketogenic diet to AD patients.

Automated detection of COVID-19 infection from CT images based on deep models is important for faster examination. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale training data systematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we explore the feasibility of learning deep models for lung and COVID-19 infection segmentation from a single radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological images. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called CoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given condition, i.e., the annotation mask of the lungs and infected regions. Our CoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of the single radiological image, and further synthesize high-resolution (512 × 512) and diverse radiological images that match the input conditions precisely. We evaluate the efficacy of CoSinGAN in learning lung and infection segmentation from very few radiological images by performing 5-fold cross validation on COVID-19-CT-Seg dataset (20 CT cases) and an independent testing on the MosMed dataset (50 CT cases). Both 2D U-Net and 3D U-Net, learned from four CT slices by using our CoSinGAN, have achieved notable infection segmentation performance, surpassing the COVID-19-CT-Seg-Benchmark, i.e., the counterparts trained on an average of 704 CT slices, by a large margin. Such results strongly confirm that our method has the potential to learn COVID-19 infection segmentation from few radiological images in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Pengyi; Zhong, Yunxin; Deng, Yulin; Tang, Xiaoying; Li, Xiaoqiong",Diagnostics (Basel),601,16

In this study, we analyzed available complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences using the CpG index as a signature of Zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) activity to examine population variations in innate intracellular antiviral competencies. The result suggests that differential ZAP activity may be a major determinant of the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Africa, Asia, and pools of asymptomatic patients had I_CpG signature evidence of high ZAP activity, while SARS-CoV-2 sequences from North America and Intensive Care Unit or Deceased patients had I_CpG signature of low ZAP activity. ZAP activity is linked to the interferon system. Low ZAP activity may be part of the explanation for the increased morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly and with comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. It may also provide some insight into the discrepancies between invitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of candidate therapies and performance in clinical trials.

These teaching and learning strategies were analysed in relation to their engagement with an initiative called Integrated approach to Technology in Education (ITE). ITE engagement in the pre‐CLP involved using project‐based learning (PBL) with technology and continuous, practise‐based professional development for teachers focusing on integrating constructivist use of technology in their curriculum and pedagogy. A survey and interviews of teachers revealed that teachers with higher ITE engagement in the pre‐CLP were more likely to use PBL with technology during the CLP. Students' interviews indicated that this PBL involved deep research and technical skills that were also practised during the CLP using distance technologies. Thus, the study demonstrated adaptation of ITE innovation into a distance mode; the introduction of WebQuests during the CLP improved the likelihood of teachers engaging in project‐based teaching and PBL during the CLP. Policymakers, practitioners and researchers are recommended to adopt and continue to study the sustainability of ITE approach in new contexts such as the CLP. PRACTITIONER NOTES: : Project‐based learning (PBL) with technology is related to constructivist use of technology which leads to higher order thinking skills and the learner's ability to adapt learning and knowledge in new contexts. Effective teacher professional development (TPD) is continuous, uses community of practise (CoP) groups and offers opportunities to practise new knowledge and skills in the classroom context. TPD for technology integration allows the demonstration and practise of constructivist pedagogies. Access to devices, connectivity and digital resources in the local language are major issues faced by students to connect with teaching and learning in the COVID‐lockdown period (CLP), especially students in underprivileged settings. : Prior exposure to PBL with technology and effective TPD when combined with demonstrations of this learning in a new context (COVID‐19 lockdown period, CLP required distance mode) will increase the likelihood of implementing PBL with technology in this new context. Besides increased use of technology, the CLP created a scope for adoption of teaching and learning pedagogies in the post‐CLP, such as the use of Instant Messaging Application (IMA) for a flipped classroom experience across home/social and school settings. : Standardised digital resources may not be the only solution for teaching and learning when schools have to be closed. Constructivist use of technology by students with project‐based learning (PBL), artefact creation on authentic tasks and inquiry‐based learning has the potential to transform students from passive consumers into active adapters in newer contexts like COVID‐19 lockdown period (CLP).

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 403 adult patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital, China. The antiviral drugs arbidol, interferon alpha-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir and ribavirin were distributed to the patients for treatment. The primary endpoint of this study was the time to develop severe illness. RESULTS: Of the 462 patients admitted, 403 had moderate COVID-19 symptoms at hospital admission and were included in this study. 90 of the 403 (22.3%) patients progressed to severe illness. The use of arbidol was associated with a lower severity rate 3.5% compared to control group 30.5%, p-value < 0.0001; the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.28 (95% CI: 0.084–0.90, p = 0.033). The use of interferon alpha-1b was associated with a lower severity rate 15.5% compared to control group 29.3%, with p-value < 0.0001; the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.30 (95% CI: 0.15–0.58, p = 0.0005). The use of lopinavir–itonavir and ribavirin did not show significant differences in adjusted regression models. Early use of arbidol within 7 days of symptom onset was significantly associated with a reduced recovery time of − 5.2 days (IQR − 3.0 to − 7.5, p = 4e−06) compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Treatment with arbidol and interferon alpha-1b contributes to reducing the severity of illness in patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. Early use of arbidol may reduce patients’ recovery time.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been regarded as an important target for vaccine and therapeutics development because it plays a key role in binding the human cell receptor ACE2 that is required for viral entry. However, it is not easy to detect RBD in Western blot using polyclonal antibody, suggesting that RBD may form a complicated conformation under native condition and bear rare linear epitope. So far, no linear epitope on RBD is reported. Thus, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes linear epitope on RBD will become valuable. In the present study, an RBD-specific rabbit antibody named 9E1 was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of immunized rabbit by RBD-specific single B cell sorting and mapped to a highly conserved linear epitope within twelve amino acids (480)CNGVEGFNCYFP(491) on RBD. 9E1 works well in Western blot on S protein and immunohistochemistry on the SARS-CoV-2 infected tissue sections. The results demonstrated that 9E1 can be used as a useful tool for pathological and functional studies of SARS-CoV-2.","Hong, Junping; Wang, Qian; Wu, Qian; Chen, Junyu; Wang, Xijing; Wang, Yingbin; Chen, Yixin; Xia, Ningshao",Vaccines (Basel),601,5

Patients with risk factors are vulnerable to severe morbidity and mortality. Favipiravir (FPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are considered possible COVID-19 treatments. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of FPV compared to HCQ in patients with COVID-19 as the standard of care approved by the national protocol there. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study on patients with COVID-19 who were administered either FPV or HCQ at King Faisal Medical Complex, Taif, Saudi Arabia, from June 2020 to August 2020. RESULTS: In total, 508 patients were included in the analysis. Patients were categorized into three groups by medication. Patients enrolled in this study were 244 (55.8%) on FPV, 193 (44.2%) on HCQ and 71 (13.81%) on neither medication. Patients who received FPV had higher age and greater comorbidity. Most of the patients were discharged on day 14 (n = 303, 59.6%), 26 (36.6%) in neither med, 154 (63.1%) in FPV and 123 (63.7%) in HCQ groups with significant difference between groups (P < 0.0001). Mortality rate was 8.2% (n = 20) in FPV and 7.3% (n = 14) in HCQ groups with significant difference between groups (P = 0.048). Regarding drug safety, 19.7% of patients treated with FPV vs 7.8% HCQ have adverse effects with significant difference between groups (P < 0.0001). Most of the side effects were increase ALT and AST. Meanwhile, prolonged Q-T interval was reported only in the HCQ group (2.6%). From Cox regression modeling, only mechanical ventilation due to Covid 19 was predictive for mortality (HR: 16.598, 95% CI: 7.095–38.828, P < 0.0001). Meanwhile, there was no significant difference in the prediction of discharge of FPV (vs HCQ) (HR: 0.933, 95% CI: 0.729–1.195, P = 0.5843), predictors of mortality were HCQ (vs FPV) (HR: 2.3, 95% CI: 0.994–5.487, P = 0.0518). Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed improved survival time and discharged time among patients in the HCQ versus FPV group with an insignificant difference between them (P = 0.85, P = 0.06, respectively). CONCLUSION: The present study concluded that FPV and HCQ showed comparable efficacy in decrease mortality and oxygen requirements. FPV likely has a more favorable safety profile regarding cardiac toxicity. A randomized clinical trial with large patient numbers is recommended to confirm the effectiveness of these drugs in COVID-19 patients.","Alotaibi, Musim; Ali, Ahmed; Bakhshwin, Duaa; Alatawi, Yasser; Alotaibi, Sultan; Alhifany, Abdullah; Alharthi, Badr; Alharthi, Nasser; Alyazidi, Awatef; Alharthi, Yasmeen; Alrafiah, Aziza",Int J Gen Med,601,19

Nevertheless, the home PC professionals (PCPs) faced a challenging situation due to increased number of discharged patients, reduced availability of healthcare facilities and physical/relational barriers between them and patients. This study aimed to investigate the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on burnout and psychological morbidity among home PCPs in Italy. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-eighth PC physicians and nurses working in home assistance in Italy were invited to participate. The results obtained by the investigation conducted during the Covid-19 emergency (COVID2020) were compared with data collected in 2016 in the same setting (BURNOUT2016). The questionnaires (socio-demographics, Maslach Burnout Inventory and General Health Questionnaire-12) were the same for both the surveys. The PCPs participating in COVID2020 survey (n=145) were mostly the same (70%) who participated to the BURNOUT2016 study (n=179). RESULTS: One hundred and forty-five PCPs participated in the study (response rate 73.2%). During the Covid-19 emergency, home PCPs presented a lower burnout frequency (p<.001) and higher level of personal accomplishment than in 2016 (p=.047). Conversely, the risk for psychological morbidity was significantly higher during the pandemic (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: In the age of Covid-19, the awareness of being at the forefront of containing the pandemic along with the sense of responsibility toward their high-risk patients may arouse PCPs psychological distress, but, on the other hand, this condition may improve their sense of professional satisfaction and personal accomplishment.","Varani, Silvia; Ostan, Rita; Franchini, Luca; Ercolani, Giacomo; Pannuti, Raffaella; Biasco, Guido; Bruera, Eduardo",J Pain Symptom Manage,601,21

Vitamin K deficiency was recently found to associate with clinical outcome in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Vitamin D has been hypothesized to reduce disease susceptibility by modulating inflammation, yet little is known about its role in disease severity. Considering the critical interaction between vitamin K and vitamin D in calcium and elastic fiber metabolism, we determined vitamin D status in the same cohort of 135 hospitalized COVID-19 patients by measuring blood 25(OH)D levels. We found no difference in vitamin D status between those with good and poor outcome (defined as intubation and/or death). Instead, we found vitamin D sufficient persons (25(OH)D >50 nmol/L) had accelerated elastic fiber degradation compared to those with mild deficiency (25(OH)D 25-50 nmol/L). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that vitamin D might have both favorable anti-inflammatory and unfavorable pro-calcification effects during COVID-19 and that vitamin K might compensate for the latter.","Walk, J.; Dofferhoff, A.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the results of a rigorous, large-scale COVID-19 testing and monitoring program. DESIGN: The U.S. National Football League (NFL) and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) instituted a large-scale COVID-19 monitoring program involving daily testing using 2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) platforms (Roche cobas and Thermo Fisher QuantStudio), a transcription-mediated amplification platform (Hologic Panther), and an antigen point-of-care (aPOC) test (Quidel Sofia). SETTING: 32 NFL clubs in 24 states during the 2020 NFL season. PARTICIPANTS: NFL players and staff. MEASUREMENTS: SARS-CoV-2 test results were described in the context of medically adjudicated status. Cycle threshold (Ct) values are reported when available. RESULTS: A total of 632 370 tests administered across 11 668 persons identified 270 (2.4%) COVID-19 cases from 1 August to 14 November 2020. Positive predictive values ranged from 73.0% to 82.0% across the RT-PCR platforms. High Ct values (33 to 37) often indicated early infection. For the first positive result, the median Ct value was 32.77 (interquartile range, 30.02 to 34.72) and 22% of Ct values were above 35. Among adjudicated COVID-19 cases tested with aPOC, 42.3% had a negative result. Positive concordance between aPOC test result and adjudicated case status increased as viral load increased. LIMITATIONS: Platforms varied by laboratory, and test variability may reflect procedural differences. CONCLUSION: Routine RT-PCR testing allowed early detection of infection. Cycle threshold values provided a useful guidepost for understanding results, with high values often indicating early infection. Antigen POC testing was unable to reliably rule out COVID-19 early in infection.

Evidence from previous emerging infectious disease outbreaks points to the role of perceived risk, worry, media coverage, and knowledge in shaping engagement with health-protective behaviors and vaccination intentions. The aim of the current study was to examine the role of these factors in predicting recommended health-protective behaviors early in the pandemic. A secondary aim was to assess uncertainty and misconceptions about COVID-19. An online survey of 2,174 Australian residents was completed between March 2 and 9, 2020, at an early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia. Results revealed that two-thirds of respondents were at least moderately worried about a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. Worry about the outbreak and closely following media coverage were consistent predictors of greater engagement with health-protective behaviors and higher vaccination intentions. Uncertainty and misconceptions about COVID-19 were common, including uncertainty about whether people are likely to have natural or existing immunity to the virus. There was also uncertainty around whether specific home remedies (e.g., vitamins and saline rinses) would offer protection and whether the virus was human-made and deliberately released. Such misconceptions are likely to cause concern for members of the public. The findings also highlight psychological and demographic factors associated with lower engagement with health-protective behaviors, including male gender, younger age, and low levels of worry about the outbreak. These findings offer potential pathways and targets for interventions to encourage health-protective behaviors. The results relating to uncertainty and misconceptions about COVID-19 point to areas that could be usefully targeted by public information campaigns.","Faasse, Kate; Newby, Jill",Front Psychol,601,20

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in northern India. All consecutive confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 cases aged 15 years and older from 13 Apr till 31 Aug 2020 are included. Primary end point was 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Of 1622 patients ,1536 cases were valid. Median age was 36 years, 88.3% were men and 58.1% were symptomatic. Fever (37.6%) was commonest presenting symptom. Dyspnea was reported by 15.4%. Primary hypertension (8.5%) was commonest comorbidity, followed by diabetes mellitus (6.7%). Mild, moderate, and severe hypoxemia were seen in 3.4%, 4.3%, and 0.8% respectively. Logistic regression showed greater odds of moderate/severe disease in patients with dyspnea, hypertension, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and malignancy. Seventy six patients died (4.9%).

However, its effectiveness hinges on adherence by individuals who face substantial burdens from the required behavioral restrictions. Here, we investigate sources of individual variation in adhering to social distancing guidelines. In a high-powered study (N = 895), we tested direct and indirect effects of boredom and self-control on adherence. The results showed that both traits were important predictors of adherence but the underlying mechanisms differed. Specifically, individuals high in boredom perceived social distancing as more difficult, which in turn reduced their adherence (i.e., a mediated effect). In contrast, individuals high in self-control adhered more to the guidelines without perceiving them as more or less difficult; however, self-control moderated the effect of difficulty on adherence. Our results are immediately relevant to improve the efficacy of social distancing guidelines in the COVID-19 response.","Wolff, Wanja; Martarelli, Corinna S.; Schüler, Julia; Bieleke, Maik",Int J Environ Res Public Health,601,33

He is operated on in a maximum care hospital and then transferred to the critical care unit. From then on, an anonymous, very experienced physician continuously takes care of him. Four nights before Christmas, the ghost of the famous British physiologist Ernest Henry Starling appears at the patient’s bed. The ghost involves the anonymous physician in a dialogue and is very interested in the inserted Swan-Ganz catheter, then he disappears. He repeats his visits the next 3 nights. On the first occasion he is displeased with Cratchit’s low haematocrit, the second time he dislikes the mechanical ventilator settings, and on his final visit he is concerned with Cratchit’s clinical nutrition. At first, the anonymous physician is indignant with the ghost’s criticism and indoctrinations, but then recognizes that ultimately they are the key to Cratchit’s convalescence and acts accordingly. Successfully! Following the ghost’s proposals, he changes the ventilator settings, transfuses 3 units of packed red blood cells, and starts clinical nutrition. Shortly thereafter, Cratchit’s trachea is extubated, and on New Year’s Day he is ready to be discharged from the critical care unit. In this essay, Robert Bartlett transposed Charles Dickens’ “Christmas Carol” into the world of critical care. Its intention is to encourage the intensivist to scrutinize common therapeutic measures, such as mechanical ventilation, haemodynamic interventions and transfusion of blood products. Background information and comments on the addressed problems of modern intensive care are provided subsequent to the essay.","Lewandowski, K.; Bartlett, R. H.",Anaesthesist,601,1

Taking the provincial panel dataset of China as the research sample, this paper investigates the spatial impacts of green credit on the green economy. The super slack-based measure (Sup-SBM) model with undesirable outputs is employed to calculate the level of green economy within China. On this basis, we establish spatial Durbin models to study the impact of green credit on green economy and its transmission mechanisms. The results show that green credit exhibits a local-neighborhood effect on green economy; that is, the green credit can not only improve the local green economy but also generate spatial spillover effect to promote the development of green economy in surrounding areas. The above conclusion still holds after the robustness test by replacing spatial weight matrices and alternative measurement for the explained variable. Furthermore, enhancing innovation efficiency and optimizing energy structure are important ways for green credit to promote green economy. The findings of this study not only provide a new perspective for understanding the economic consequences of green credit policy but also provide empirical evidence for the important role of green finance in achieving the win-win goals of economic growth and environmental protection.

METHODS: We included adults aged 18–45 years with type 1 diabetes, using CGM, followed by telemedicine at a Southern Italian University Hospital. Thirty-two home-quarantined subjects with SARS-CoV-2 positive swab constituted the COVID-19 group. Thirty age-matched diabetic individuals without COVID-19 formed the control group. The effects of COVID-19 on glycemic control in patients infected were assessed at different time points [2 weeks before-COVID-19 (Time 1), 2 weeks during-COVID-19 (Time 2) and 2 weeks after COVID-19 (Time 3)] and compared with those without infection. RESULTS: A significant reduction of TIR (Time 1 vs Time 2, %, 60.1 ± 16.6 vs 55.4 ± 19.2, P = 0.03), associated with a significant increase of TAR level 2 (10.1 ± 7.3 vs 16.7 ± 12.9, P < 0.001), GMI (7.1 ± 0.6 vs 7.5 ± 0.8, P < 0.001), CV (37.3 ± 7.1 vs 39.6 ± 7.0, P = 0.04), mean glucose values (mg/dL, 160.2 ± 26.5 vs 175.5 ± 32.6, P = 0.001) and standard deviation (59.2 ± 13.1 vs 68.6 ± 17.7, P = 0.001) was observed in patients with COVID-19. No significant change of glycemic metrics was found in the NO COVID-19 group across the time.

In pastoral and nomadic communities in the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs), camels play a vital role in food security, while commercial milk production and formalized export markets are rapidly emerging as camel populations expand into non-traditional areas. Until recently, little focus was placed on camels as hosts of zoonotic disease, but the emergence of Middle Eastern respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and the discovery of exposure to the virus in Kenyan camels, highlighted the need for further understanding of this area. This systematised review utilised a robust search strategy to assess the occurrence of camel-associated zoonoses in Kenya and to evaluate the quality of the published literature. Seventy-four studies were identified, covering sixteen pathogens, with an increasing number of good quality studies in recent years. Despite this, the area remains under-researched and there is a lack of robust, high-quality research. Trypanosome spp., Echinococcus granulosus and Brucella spp. appeared most frequently in the literature. Pathogens with the highest reported prevalence were MERS-CoV (0–100%), Echinococcus granulosa (7–60%) and Rift Valley fever virus (7–57%). Exposure to Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus showed higher levels in camel or camel-associated vectors than other livestock species, although brucellosis was the only disease for which there was robust evidence linking camel and human exposure. Zoonotic agents with less severe human health outcomes, such as Dermatophilosus congolensis and contagious ecthyma, were also represented in the literature. This review provides an important summary of the scope and quality of current knowledge. It demonstrates that further research, and improved adherence to robust study design and reporting are essential if the zoonotic risk from camels in Kenya, and elsewhere, is to be better understood.","Hughes, Ellen Clare; Anderson, Neil Euan",Vet Sci,601,16

CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) against PB1 and highly conserved regions of PB2 were screened in conjunction with mRNA-encoded Cas13a. Screens were designed such that only guides that decreased influenza RNA levels in a Cas13-mediated fashion, were valid. Cas13a mRNA and validated guides, delivered post-infection, simulating treatment, were tested in combination and across multiplicities of infection. Their function was also characterized over time. Similar screens were performed for guides against SARS-CoV-2, yielding multiple guides that significantly impacted cytopathic effect. Last, the approach was utilized in vivo, demonstrating the ability to degrade influenza RNA in a mouse model of infection, using polymer-formulated, nebulizer-based mRNA delivery.

In the existing research, the balance between the construction of the life circle and the needs of the people in the life circle still needs to be further fulfilled. This paper is based on the city’s multi-source large data set including 2018 AutoNavi POI (Point of Interests), OSM (OpenStreetMap) road network data and LandScan population data set, and evaluates the current status of Shanghai’s 15min-CLC through the fusion of kernel density estimation, service area analysis and other statistical models and proposes relevant optimization suggestions. The results show that there are the following shortcomings: (1) From the perspective of different types of infrastructure service facilities, the spatial construction of Shanghai’s overall life service facilities and shopping service facilities needs to be optimized. (2) From the perspective of comprehensive evaluation, the comprehensive service convenience of infrastructure service facilities in the downtown area is relatively high, while the comprehensive service convenience of urban infrastructure service facilities in the suburbs and outer suburbs is relatively low; The diversity of basic service facilities in the 15min-CLC in the downtown area is more consistent with the population distribution; However, in the peripheral areas of the urban area, too many infrastructure service facilities have been constructed. Based on the above shortcomings and the perspective of supply and demand matching, relevant optimization strategies are proposed in different regions and different types of infrastructure service facilities: (1) focus on the construction of basic service facilities in the urban fringe and urban-rural areas, improve the full coverage of the basic service facilities, and appropriately reduce the number of basic service facilities in the downtown area. (2) The development of community business models can be used to promote the development of new life service facilities and shopping service facilities. (3) Improve community medical institutions through facility function conversion, merger and reconstruction, etc. (4) Optimize the hierarchical basic service facility system and improve the population supporting facilities of basic service facilities in the 15min-CLC. This paper incorporates people’s needs and concerns on the living environment into the 15min-CLC evaluation model, and uses Shanghai as an example to conduct research, summarizes the existing shortcomings, and proposes corresponding optimization strategies based on the matching of supply and demand.

There is little guidance on how to monitor contact tracing performance, and no systematic overview of indicators to assess contact tracing systems or conceptual framework for such indicators exists to date. Methods: We conducted a rapid scoping review using a systematic literature search strategy in the peer-reviewed and grey literature as well as open source online documents. We developed a conceptual framework to map indicators by type (input, process, output, outcome, impact) and thematic area (human resources, financial resources, case investigation, contact identification, contact testing, contact follow up, case isolation, contact quarantine, transmission chain interruption, incidence reduction). Results: We identified a total of 153 contact tracing indicators from 1,555 peer-reviewed studies, 894 studies from grey literature sources, and 15 sources from internet searches. Two-thirds of indicators were process indicators (102; 67%), while 48 (31%) indicators were output indicators. Only three (2%) indicators were input indicators. Indicators covered seven out of ten conceptualized thematic areas, with more than half being related to either case investigation (37; 24%) or contact identification (44; 29%). There were no indicators for the input area 'financial resources', the outcome area 'transmission chain interruption', and the impact area 'incidence reduction'. Conclusions: Almost all identified indicators were either process or output indicators focusing on case investigation, contact identification, case isolation or contact quarantine. We identified important gaps in input, outcome and impact indicators, which constrains evidence-based assessment of contact tracing systems. A universally agreed set of indicators is needed to allow for cross-system comparisons and to improve the performance of contact tracing systems.","Vogt, F.; Kurup, K.; Mussleman, P.; Habrun, C.; Crowe, M.; Woodward, A.; Jaramillo-Gutierrez, G.; Kaldor, J.; Vong, S.; Del Rio Vilas, V.",,601,20

One drug that has shown promising results in vitro is nitazoxanide. Unlike other postulated drugs, nitazoxanide shows a high ratio of maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), after 1 day of 500 mg twice daily (BD), to the concentration required to inhibit 50% replication (EC(50)) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (C(max): EC(50)roughly equal to 14:1). As such, it is important to investigate the safety of nitazoxanide for further trials. Furthermore, treatments for COVID-19 should be cheap to promote global access, but prices of many drugs are far higher than the costs of production. We aimed to conduct a review of the safety of nitazoxanide for any prior indication and calculate its minimum costs of production. METHODS: A review of nitazoxanide clinical research was conducted using EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched for phase 2 or 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nitazoxanide with placebo or active control for 5–14 days in participants experiencing acute infections of any kind. Data extracted were grade 1–4 and serious adverse events (AEs). Data were also extracted on gastrointestinal (GI) AEs, as well as hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects. Active pharmaceutical ingredient cost data from 2016 to 2019 were extracted from the Panjiva database and adjusted for 5% loss during production, costs of excipients, formulation, a 10% profit margin and tax. Two dosages, at 500 mg BD and a higher dose of 1100 mg three times daily (TDS), were considered. Our estimated costs were compared with publicly available list prices from a selection of countries. RESULTS: Nine RCTs of nitazoxanide were identified for inclusion. These RCTs accounted for 1514 participants and an estimated 95.3 person-years-of-follow-up. No significant differences were found in any of the AE endpoints assessed, across all trials or on subgroup analyses of active- or placebo-controlled trials. Mild GI AEs increased with dose. No hepatorenal or cardiovascular concerns were raised, but few appropriate metrics were reported. There were no teratogenic concerns, but the evidence base was very limited. Based on a weighted-mean cost of US $61/kg, a 14-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide 500 mg BD would cost $1.41. The daily cost would therefore be $0.10. The same 14-day course could cost $3944 in US commercial pharmacies, and $3 per course in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. At a higher dose of 1100 mg TDS, our estimated cost was $4.08 per 14-day course, equivalent to $0.29 per day. CONCLUSION: Nitazoxanide demonstrates a good safety profile at approved doses. However, further evidence is required regarding hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects, as well as teratogenicity. We estimate that it would be possible to manufacture nitazoxanide as generic for $1.41 for a 14-day treatment course at 500 mg BD, up to $4.08 at 1100 mg TDS. Further trials in COVID-19 patients should be initiated. If efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated in clinical studies, nitazoxanide may represent a safe and affordable treatment in the ongoing pandemic.","Pepperrell, Toby; Pilkington, Victoria; Owen, Andrew; Wang, Junzheng; Hill, Andrew M.",J Virus Erad,601,1

METHODS: We reviewed the whole course of the COVID-19 in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University (from January 14, 2020 till March 12, 2020). We compared the clinical manifestation and immune profiles among different patient groups with healthy individuals. RESULTS: 42 out of 230 HD patients (18.26%) and 4 out of 33 medical staff (12.12%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. 15 HD patients (6.52%), including 10 COVID-19 diagnosed, died. Only 2 deaths of the COVID-19 HD patients were associated with pneumonia/lung failure, others were ascribed to cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases or hyperkalemia. Except for 3 patients who were admitted to ICU for severe condition (8.11%), including 2 dead, most COVID-19 diagnosed patients presented mild or non-respiratory symptoms. The flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood showed that multiple lymphocyte populations in HD patients were significantly decreased. HD patients with COVID-19 even displayed more remarkable reduction of serum inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the general population, HD patients and health care professionals are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area during the outbreak. A majority of HD Patients with COVID-19 exhibited mild clinical symptoms and did not progress to severe pneumonia likely due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm.

No studies used feasible methods of smell testing that the public would use to address the accuracy of these claims. METHODS: This is a single-center study conducted between April 2020 and June 2020. The sense of smell was tested in vitally stable suspected COVID-19 patients with no/mild upper respiratory tract infection symptoms prior to nasopharyngeal swabbing for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Patients were instructed to close their eyes. Each nostril was tested separately while the other was blocked with the patient's index finger. Patients inhaled from 2 concealed vials (coffee and strawberry essence) consecutively, kept within 30 cm of the nostril for 60 s. Patients who could not identify both odors with both nostrils were recorded as “anosmia.” RESULTS: Out of 346 eligible subjects, 43 had anosmia of which 26 (60%) tested COVID-19 positive. χ2 test showed a p value <0.001. The test showed a sensitivity of 30% (95% confidence interval [CI] 21%, 41%) and specificity 94% (95% CI 90%, 96%). Logistic regression revealed an odds ratio of 5.9 (95% CI 3.0, 12) p value <0.001. CONCLUSION: Given the low sensitivity (30%) of this method in detecting COVID-19 infection, we conclude that this method is not a useful screening tool for COVID-19 infection.

This study aims to describe the incidence of extreme QTc interval prolongation among COVID-19 patients on this experimental treatment and to identify the clinical features associated with extreme QTc prolongation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 87 COVID-19 patients, treated with triple combination including LPN/RTN, HQ and AZT, were analyzed. QT interval was obtained by the tangent method and corrected for heart rate using Bazett’s formula. Extreme QTc interval prolongation was considered an absolute QTc interval ≥ 500 ms or an increase in QTc intervals of 60 ms or greater (ΔQTc ≥ 60 ms) compared with baseline. RESULTS: Hypertension (66.7%) and diabetes (25.3%) were the most prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities. Twenty patients (23%) showed extreme QTc interval prolongation; no clinical, electrocardiographic or pharmacological characteristics have been associated to extreme QTc prolongation, except the history of ischemic stroke (P= 0,007). One torsade de pointes (TdP) in patient with QTc extreme prolongation (QTc: 560 ms) after 5 days of therapy was recorded.

The concept and definition of aerosols is also discussed, as is the concept of large droplet transmission, and airborne transmission which is meant by most authors to be synonymous with aerosol transmission, although some use the term to mean either large droplet or aerosol transmission. However, these terms are often used confusingly when discussing specific infection control interventions for individual pathogens that are accepted to be mostly transmitted by the airborne (aerosol) route (e.g. tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox). It is therefore important to clarify such terminology, where a particular intervention, like the type of personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used, is deemed adequate to intervene for this potential mode of transmission, i.e. at an N95 rather than surgical mask level requirement. With this in mind, this review considers the commonly used term of ‘aerosol transmission’ in the context of some infectious agents that are well-recognized to be transmissible via the airborne route. It also discusses other agents, like influenza virus, where the potential for airborne transmission is much more dependent on various host, viral and environmental factors, and where its potential for aerosol transmission may be underestimated.","Tellier, Raymond; Li, Yuguo; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Tang, Julian W.",BMC Infect Dis,601,20

METHODS: During two winter periods, respiratory virus real-time multiplex PCR results were evaluated from children (< 18 years) presenting to the emergency department of a tertiary referral hospital with ARTI that had been sampled within 48 hours of hospital presentation. In an attempt to identify virus-specific distinguishing clinical features, single virus infections were correlated with presenting signs and symptoms, clinical findings and outcomes using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In total, 274 children with ARTI were evaluated and most were aged < 3 years (236/274, 86%). PCR detected respiratory viruses in 224/274 (81.8%) children and included 162 (59%) single and 62 (23%) mixed virus infections. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) single virus infections were common among children aged < 3 years, but proportional differences compared to older children were only significant for RSV (95% CI 1.3–15). Clinical differentiation between viral ARTIs was not possible due to common shared presenting signs and symptoms and the high frequency of mixed viral infections. We observed virus-associated outcome differences among children aged < 3 years. Oxygen treatment was associated with RSV (OR 3.6) and inversely correlated with FLU (OR 0.05). Treatment with steroids (OR 3.4) or bronchodilators (OR 3.4) was associated with HRV. Severe respiratory complications were associated with HRV (OR 3.5) and inversely correlated with RSV (OR 0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are frequently detected in young children presenting to the hospital emergency department with ARTI and require PCR diagnosis since presenting signs and symptoms are not discriminant for a type of virus. RSV and HRV bear a high burden of morbidity in the pediatric clinical setting.","Gooskens, Jairo; van der Ploeg, Vishnu; Sukhai, Ram N; Vossen, Ann CTM; Claas, Eric CJ; Kroes, Aloys CM",BMC Pediatr,601,24

Inpatient or full-day outpatient rehabilitation are some of the standard therapies. For sustainable rehabilitation, continuation of rehabilitation after discharge from a rehabilitation centre is vital. Besides medical exercise therapy (MET), home-based physical exercise programmes are used. To monitor exercise quantity and quality, AGT-Reha, a health-enabling technology for home rehabilitation, has been developed and evaluated in a pilot study for technical feasibility and acceptance. To integrate the digital therapeutic AGT-Reha into regular healthcare processes, an efficacy evaluation is required. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: AGT-Reha-WK is a prospective, monocentric, non-randomised, unblinded non-inferiority trial. Primary objective is to investigate whether AGT-Reha enhanced home-based exercise training is non-inferior to MET as standard aftercare. Secondary objective is to compare the costs of both therapies. Efficacy as medical success (primary outcome) is examined with regard to ability to work, return to work and sustainability of training (secondary outcomes). The outcome measure for non-inferiority is shoulder function (pain and disability) assessed by the standardised Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). The non-inferiority margin is set to 10 points on SPADI score using a 95% CI. Subjects will be recruited at the Rehabilitation Center Bad Pyrmont, Germany. The total number of subjects should be 84 (42 per group). Treatment takes 6 months per patient. Subjects will be assessed at four time points: pre-baseline (admission to rehabilitation centre), baseline (discharge from rehabilitation centre), post-therapy and follow-up (3 months post-therapy). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of Hannover Medical School (ethics approval no: 7313). Results of the trial are planned to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00011596. Registered 2 June 2017.

We carried out a study to examine obstetric intervention, preterm birth, and stillbirth rates in Canada from March to August 2020. METHODS The study included all singleton hospital deliveries in Canada (excluding Québec) from March to August 2020 (and March to August for the years 2015-2019) with information obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information. Data for Ontario were examined separately because this province had the highest rates of COVID-19 in the study population. Rates and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to quantify pregnancy-related outcomes. RESULTS There were 136,445 and 717,905 singleton hospital deliveries in Canada (excluding Quebéc) in from March to August 2020 and between March and August 2015-2019, respectively. Rates of obstetric intervention declined in early gestation in 2020. Odds ratios for labour induction and cesarean delivery at <32 weeks gestation for March-August 2020 versus March-August in 2015 to 2019 were 0.84 (95% CI 0.74-0.95) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.85-1.00), respectively. Preterm birth rates increased in Canada (excluding Québec) from 6.42% in March-August 2015 to 6.74% in March-August 2019 but were unchanged in March-August 2020 (6.74%). Stillbirth rates were stable between March-August 2015 and March-August 2020. However, stillbirth rates peaked in Ontario in April 2020 due to higher rates of stillbirths at 20-27 and 37-41 weeks gestation. CONCLUSION Changes in labour induction and cesarean delivery at early gestation and other perinatal outcomes during the period of March to August 2020 highlight the need to reconsider the use and impact of obstetric services in pandemics as well as the need for timely perinatal surveillance.","Liu, Shiliang; Dzakpasu, Susie; Nelson, Chantal; Wei, Shu Qin; Little, Julian; Scott, Heather; Joseph, K S",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obstetrique et gynecologie du Canada : JOGC,601,1

Objective: To compare the clinical characteristics, treatments, and evolution of critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated in Intensive Care Units (ICU) after one year of pandemic. Methodology: Multicenter, prospective study, which included critical COVID-19 patients in 9 ICUs in northwestern Spain. The clinical characteristics, treatments, and evolution of patients admitted to the ICU during the months of March-April 2020 (period 1) were compared with patients admitted in January-February 2021 (period 2). Results: 337 patients were included (98 in period 1 and 239 in period 2). In period 2, fewer patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (65% vs 84%, p <0.001), using high-flow nasal cannulas (CNAF) more frequently (70% vs 7%, p <0.001), ventilation non-invasive mechanical (NIMV) (40% vs 14%, p <0.001), corticosteroids (100% vs 96%, p = 0.007) and prone position in both awake (42% vs 28%, p = 0.012), and intubated patients (67% vs 54%, p = 0.034). The days of IMV, ICU stay and hospital stay were lower in period 2. Mortality was similar in the two periods studied (16% vs 17%). Conclusions: After 1 year of pandemic, we observed that in patients admitted to the ICU, CNAF, NIMV, use of the prone position, and corticosteroids have been used more frequently, reducing the number of patients in IMV, and the length of stay in the ICU and hospital stay.

We examined the clinical courses of critically ill COVID-19 patients with and without pre-existing kidney disease and investigated the association between degree of underlying kidney disease and in-hospital outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTINGS & PARTICIPANTS: 4,264 critically ill COVID-19 patients (143 dialysis patients, 521 chronic kidney disease [CKD] patients, and 3,600 patients without CKD) admitted to ICUs at 68 hospitals in the United States. PREDICTOR(S): Presence (versus absence) of pre-existing kidney disease OUTCOME(S): In-hospital mortality (primary); respiratory failure, shock, ventricular arrhythmia/ cardiac arrest, thromboembolic event, major bleed, and acute liver injury (secondary) ANALYTICAL APPROACH: We used standardized differences to compare patient characteristics (values >0.10 indicate a meaningful difference between groups) and multivariable adjusted Fine and Gray survival models to examine outcome associations. RESULTS: Dialysis patients had a shorter time from symptom onset to ICU admission compared to other groups (median [quartile 1-quartile 3] days: 4 [2-9] for dialysis patients; 7 [3-10] for CKD patients; 7 [4-10] for patients without pre-existing kidney disease). More dialysis patients (25%) reported altered mental status than those with CKD (20%, standardized difference = 0.12) and no kidney disease (12%, standardized difference = 0.36). Half of dialysis and CKD patients died within 28-days of ICU admission versus 35% of patients without pre-existing kidney disease. Compared to patients without pre-existing kidney disease, dialysis patients had a higher risk of 28-day in-hospital death (adjusted HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.09, 1.81), while patients with CKD had an intermediate risk (adjusted HR 1.25; 95% CI 1.08, 1.44).

The circadian amplitude of most physiological variables is reduced, while the circadian phase becomes more labile and tends to occur earlier with advancing age. As the incidence of falls in older persons could follow circadian variations, a better understanding of conditions in which falls occur can lead to the implementation of countermeasures (such as adjusting the scheduling of hospital staff, or changing the timing of anti-hypertensive medication if falls are related to undesirable circadian patterns of blood pressure and/or heart rate). This includes knowing the times of the day, days of the week, and times of the year when falls are more likely to occur at home or in the hospital. Additionally, the links between aging processes and factors associated with an increased risk of developing autonomic dysfunction are well established. A strong association between heart rate variability indexes and aging has been shown. Circadian rhythms of autonomous nervous system activity may play important role for maintenance of orthostatic tolerance. Whether one is concerned with disease prediction and prevention or maintenance of healthy aging, the study of circadian rhythms and the broader time structure underlying physiopathology is helpful in terms of screening, early diagnosis and prognosis, as well as the timely institution of prophylactic and/or palliative/curative treatment. Timing the administration of such treatment as a function of circadian (and other) rhythms also could lead to reduction of falls in older persons. Finally, a prominent circadian rhythm characterizes melatonin, which peaks during the night. The circadian amplitude of melatonin decreases as a function of age, raising the questions whether such a decrease in the circadian amplitude of melatonin relates to a higher risk of falls and, if so, whether melatonin supplementation may be an effective countermeasure. This narrative review assesses the relationships between fall risk and the potential role circadian rhythms and melatonin play in mitigating this risk. We aim to provide healthcare workers adequate information about fall risk in older persons, including the potential role of the circadian rhythms and/or melatonin, as well as to lay foundations for future fall prevention interventional studies.","Goswami, Nandu; Abulafia, Carolina; Vigo, Daniel; Moser, Maximilian; Cornelissen, Germaine; Cardinali, Daniel",Clin Interv Aging,601,20

METHODS: A correlational study was conducted to examine the relationship between study variables. Participants were 400 Palestinian adults, involving 172 males and 228 females, living in the city of Tulkarem, Palestine, during the spread of coronavirus. Participants were selected using convenience and snowball sampling techniques. RESULTS: Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to test the relationship between positive religious coping, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress. Findings revealed a statistically significant negative correlation between positive religious coping and depressive symptoms (r = − .17, p < .01). Results also indicated a statistically significant negative correlation between positive religious coping and perceived stress (r = − .15, p < .01). The regression analysis for predicting depressive symptoms found that both positive religious coping (B = − .21, SE = .05, β = − .18) and perceived stress (B = .41, SE = .05, β = .35) were statistically significant toward explaining variance in depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: The importance of developing intervention programs that take into consideration religious/spiritual struggles and positive religious strategies may help improve resilience and well-being among affected populations. With the recent spread of COVID-19, findings of this current study have presented important practical implications for improving the mental health and well-being among Palestinians, especially since Palestinian society continues to face different types of stressors, such as illegal occupation. Further studies are recommended to test the relationship between current study variables and other related variables.","Mahamid, Fayez Azez; Bdier, Dana",J Relig Health,601,1

Subsequently, some authors showed that the risk could vary according to age, gender, comorbidities and medical history. In a nationwide retrospective cohort, we studied the association between these comorbidities and patients’ requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or their death. METHODS: All French COVID-19 adult inpatients admitted during the first epidemic wave (February to September 2020) were included. When patients were diagnosed with obesity, diabetes or hypertension for the first time in 2020, these conditions were considered as incident comorbidities, otherwise as prevalent. We compared outcomes of IMV and in-hospital death according to obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, taking age, gender and Charlson’s comorbidity index score (CCIS) into account. RESULTS: 134,209 adult inpatients with COVID-19 were included, half of them had hypertension (N=66,613, 49.6%) and one in four were diabetic (N=32,209, 24.0%) or with obesity (N=32,070, 23.9%). Among this cohort, IMV was required for 13,596 inpatients, and 19,969 patients died. IMV and death were more frequent in male patients (Adj.OR=2.0 [95%CI:1.9-2.1] and Adj.OR=1.5 [95%CI:1.4-1.5], respectively), IMV in patients with comorbidities (Adj.OR=2.1 [95%CI:2.0-2.2] for CCIS=2 and Adj.OR=3.0 [95%CI:2.8-3.1] for CCIS≥5), and death in patients aged 80 or above (Adj.OR=17.0 [95%CI:15.5-18.6]). Adjusted on age, gender and CCIS, death was more frequent among inpatients with obesity (Adj.OR=1.2 [95%CI:1.1-1.2]) and diabetes (Adj.OR=1.2 [95%CI:1.1-1.2]). IMV was more frequently necessary for inpatients with obesity (Adj.OR=1.9 [95%CI:1.8-2.0]), diabetes (Adj.OR=1.4 [95%CI:1.3-1.4]) and hypertension (Adj.OR=1.7 [95%CI:1.6-1.8]). Comparatively, IMV was more often required for patients with the following incident comorbidities: obesity (Adj.OR=3.5 [95%CI:3.3-3.7]), diabetes (Adj.OR=2.0 [95%CI:1.8-2.1]) and hypertension (Adj.OR=2.5 [95%CI:2.4-2.6]). CONCLUSIONS: Among 134,209 inpatients with COVID-19, mortality was more frequent among patients with obesity and diabetes. IMV was more frequently necessary for inpatients with obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Patients for whom these were incident comorbidities were particularly at risk. Specific medical monitoring and vaccination should be priorities for patients with these comorbidities.","Bailly, Laurent; Fabre, Roxane; Courjon, Johan; Carles, Michel; Dellamonica, Jean; Pradier, Christian",Clin Microbiol Infect,601,5

In order to protect patients and health workers, hygiene and public health measures were intensified when the coronavirus pandemic began. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the rate of surgical site infections (SSIs) after the beginning of COVID-19 hygiene measures, which was in March 2020 in Greece. Methods: A total of 173 patients who underwent elective colorectal cancer surgery were enrolled retrospectively. Patients were divided into two groups. Group A included 98 patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery between January 2019-December 2019 (pre-COVID-19 era), whereas 75 patients (group B) underwent colorectal cancer procedures between April 2020-March 2021 (after the beginning of COVID-19 hygiene measures). Statistical analyses were done using Stata13. The student’s t-test was used to compare results between groups. Results: SSI developed in 35 of the 173 patients (20.2%). According to the results of our study, there was a statistically significant difference between the total numbers of SSIs between the 2 examined periods. 25 (25.5%) wound infections occurred in group A-patients postoperatively, whereas only 10 (13.3%) SSIs were developed in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery after the beginning of COVID-19 measures (P=0.048). Conclusions: The current study demonstrates that COVID-19 hygiene and public health measures affect the rate of SSI after elective colorectal cancer surgery.

It is not known whether this is because of changes in the characteristics of patients being admitted. OBJECTIVE: To describe changing in-hospital mortality rates over time after accounting for individual patient characteristics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 20 736 adults with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who were included in the US American Heart Association COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry and admitted to 107 acute care hospitals in 31 states from March through November 2020. A multiple mixed-effects logistic regression was then used to estimate the odds of in-hospital death adjusted for patient age, sex, body mass index, and medical history as well as vital signs, use of supplemental oxygen, presence of pulmonary infiltrates at admission, and hospital site. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital death adjusted for exposures for 4 periods in 2020. RESULTS: The registry included 20 736 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March through November 2020 (9524 women [45.9%]; mean [SD] age, 61.2 [17.9] years); 3271 patients (15.8%) died in the hospital. Mortality rates were 19.1% in March and April, 11.9% in May and June, 11.0% in July and August, and 10.8% in September through November. Compared with March and April, the adjusted odds ratios for in-hospital death were significantly lower in May and June (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.58-0.76; P < .001), July and August (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.49-0.69; P < .001), and September through November (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.73). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, high rates of in-hospital COVID-19 mortality among registry patients in March and April 2020 decreased by more than one-third by June and remained near that rate through November. This difference in mortality rates between the months of March and April and later months persisted even after adjusting for age, sex, medical history, and COVID-19 disease severity and did not appear to be associated with changes in the characteristics of patients being admitted.","Roth, Gregory A.; Emmons-Bell, Sophia; Alger, Heather M.; Bradley, Steven M.; Das, Sandeep R.; de Lemos, James A.; Gakidou, Emmanuela; Elkind, Mitchell S.
