15,"Multi-faceted, multi-versatile microarray: simultaneous detection of many viruses and their expression profiles",2004-05-26,"There are hundreds of viruses that infect different human organs and cause diseases. Some fatal emerging viral infections have become serious public health issues worldwide. Early diagnosis and subsequent treatment are therefore essential for fighting viral infections. Current diagnostic techniques frequently employ polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods to quickly detect the pathogenic viruses and establish the etiology of the disease or illness. However, the fast PCR method suffers from many drawbacks such as a high false-positive rate and the ability to detect only one or a few gene targets at a time. Microarray technology solves the problems of the PCR limitations and can be effectively applied to all fields of molecular medicine. Recently, a report in Retrovirology described a multi-virus DNA array that contains more than 250 open reading frames from eight human viruses including human immunodeficiency virus type 1. This array can be used to detect multiple viral co-infections in cells and in vivo. Another benefit of this kind of multi-virus array is in studying promoter activity and viral gene expression and correlating such readouts with the progression of disease and reactivation of latent infections. Thus, the virus DNA-chip development reported in Retrovirology is an important advance in diagnostic application which could be a potent clinical tool for characterizing viral co-infections in AIDS as well as other patients.","Shieh, Biehuoy; Li, Ching",Retrovirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC420498/,15
190,Nasal Delivery of an Adenovirus-Based Vaccine Bypasses Pre-Existing Immunity to the Vaccine Carrier and Improves the Immune Response in Mice,2008-10-29,"Pre-existing immunity to human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) is common in the general population. Bypassing pre-existing immunity could maximize Ad5 vaccine efficacy. Vaccination by the intramuscular (I.M.), nasal (I.N.) or oral (P.O.) route with Ad5 expressing Ebola Zaire glycoprotein (Ad5-ZGP) fully protected naïve mice against lethal challenge with Ebola. In the presence of pre-existing immunity, only mice vaccinated I.N. survived. The frequency of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells was reduced by 80% and by 15% in animals vaccinated by the I.M. and P.O. routes respectively. Neutralizing antibodies could not be detected in serum from either treatment group. Pre-existing immunity did not compromise the frequency of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells (3.9±1% naïve vs. 3.6±1% pre-existing immunity, PEI) nor anti-Ebola neutralizing antibody (NAB, 40±10 reciprocal dilution, both groups). The number of INF-γ+ CD8+ cells detected in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) after I.N. immunization was not compromised by pre-existing immunity to Ad5 (146±14, naïve vs. 120±16 SFC/million MNCs, PEI). However, pre-existing immunity reduced NAB levels in BAL by ∼25% in this group. To improve the immune response after oral vaccination, the Ad5-based vaccine was PEGylated. Mice given the modified vaccine did not survive challenge and had reduced levels of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells 10 days after administration (0.3±0.3% PEG vs. 1.7±0.5% unmodified). PEGylation did increase NAB levels 2-fold. These results provide some insight about the degree of T and B cell mediated immunity necessary for protection against Ebola virus and suggest that modification of the virus capsid can influence the type of immune response elicited by an Ad5-based vaccine.","Croyle, Maria A.; Patel, Ami; Tran, Kaylie N.; Gray, Michael; Zhang, Yi; Strong, James E.; Feldmann, Heinz; Kobinger, Gary P.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2569416/,15
559,Insight into the Interaction of Metal Ions with TroA from Streptococcus suis,2011-05-18,"BACKGROUND: The scavenging ability of sufficient divalent metal ions is pivotal for pathogenic bacteria to survive in the host. ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type metal transporters provide a considerable amount of different transition metals for bacterial growth. TroA is a substrate binding protein for uptake of multiple metal ions. However, the function and structure of the TroA homologue from the epidemic Streptococcus suis isolates (SsTroA) have not been characterized. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we determined the crystal structure of SsTroA from a highly pathogenic streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)-causing Streptococcus suis in complex with zinc. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis revealed that apo-SsTroA binds Zn(2+) and Mn(2+). Both metals bind to SsTroA with nanomolar affinity and stabilize the protein against thermal unfolding. Zn(2+) and Mn(2+) induce distinct conformational changes in SsTroA compared with the apo form as confirmed by both circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. NMR data also revealed that Zn(2+)/Mn(2+) bind to SsTroA in either the same site or an adjacent region. Finally, we found that the folding of the metal-bound protein is more compact than the corresponding apoprotein. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings reveal a mechanism for uptake of metal ions in S. suis and this mechanism provides a reasonable explanation as to how SsTroA operates in metal transport.","Zheng, Beiwen; Zhang, Qiangmin; Gao, Jia; Han, Huiming; Li, Ming; Zhang, Jingren; Qi, Jianxun; Yan, Jinghua; Gao, George F.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3097204/,15
594,Interplay between SIN3A and STAT3 Mediates Chromatin Conformational Changes and GFAP Expression during Cellular Differentiation,2011-07-11,"BACKGROUND: Neurons and astrocytes are generated from common neural precursors, yet neurogenesis precedes astrocyte formation during embryogenesis. The mechanisms of neural development underlying suppression and de-suppression of differentiation- related genes for cell fate specifications are not well understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By using an in vitro system in which NTera-2 cells were induced to differentiate into an astrocyte-like lineage, we revealed a novel role for Sin3A in maintaining the suppression of GFAP in NTera-2 cells. Sin3A coupled with MeCP2 bound to the GFAP promoter and their occupancies were correlated with repression of GFAP transcription. The repression by Sin3A and MeCP2 may be an essential mechanism underlying the inhibition of cell differentiation. Upon commitment toward an astrocyte-like lineage, Sin3A- MeCP2 departed from the promoter and activated STAT3 simultaneously bound to the promoter and exon 1 of GFAP; meanwhile, olig2 was exported from nuclei to the cytoplasm. This suggested that a three-dimensional or higher-order structure was provoked by STAT3 binding between the promoter and proximal coding regions. STAT3 then recruited CBP/p300 to exon 1 and targeted the promoter for histone H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation. The CBP/p300-mediated histone modification further facilitates chromatin remodeling, thereby enhancing H3K4 trimethylation and recruitment of RNA polymerase II to activate GFAP gene transcription. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide evidence that exchange of repressor and activator complexes and epigenetic modifications are critical strategies for cellular differentiation and lineage-specific gene expression.","Cheng, Pei-Yi; Lin, Yu-Ping; Chen, Ya-Ling; Lee, Yi-Ching; Tai, Chia-Chen; Wang, Yi-Ting; Chen, Yu-Ju; Kao, Cheng-Fu; Yu, John",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136934/,15
724,Deconstructing host-pathogen interactions in Drosophila,2011-10-06,"Many of the cellular mechanisms underlying host responses to pathogens have been well conserved during evolution. As a result, Drosophila can be used to deconstruct many of the key events in host-pathogen interactions by using a wealth of well-developed molecular and genetic tools. In this review, we aim to emphasize the great leverage provided by the suite of genomic and classical genetic approaches available in flies for decoding details of host-pathogen interactions; these findings can then be applied to studies in higher organisms. We first briefly summarize the general strategies by which Drosophila resists and responds to pathogens. We then focus on how recently developed genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens conducted in cells and flies, combined with classical genetic methods, have provided molecular insight into host-pathogen interactions, covering examples of bacteria, fungi and viruses. Finally, we discuss novel strategies for how flies can be used as a tool to examine how specific isolated virulence factors act on an intact host.","Bier, Ethan; Guichard, Annabel",Dis Model Mech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255543/,15
874,Novel Paramyxoviruses in Free-Ranging European Bats,2012-06-21,"The zoonotic potential of paramyxoviruses is particularly demonstrated by their broad host range like the highly pathogenic Hendra and Nipah viruses originating from bats. But while so far all bat-borne paramyxoviruses have been identified in fruit bats across Africa, Australia, South America, and Asia, we describe the detection and characterization of the first paramyxoviruses in free-ranging European bats. Moreover, we examined the possible impact of paramyxovirus infection on individual animals by comparing histo-pathological findings and virological results. Organs from deceased insectivorous bats of various species were sampled in Germany and tested for paramyxovirus RNA in parallel to a histo-pathological examination. Nucleic acids of three novel paramyxoviruses were detected, two viruses in phylogenetic relationship to the recently proposed genus Jeilongvirus and one closely related to the genus Rubulavirus. Two infected animals revealed subclinical pathological changes within their kidneys, suggestive of a similar pathogenesis as the one described in fruit bats experimentally infected with Hendra virus. Our findings indicate the presence of bat-born paramyxoviruses in geographic areas free of fruit bat species and therefore emphasize a possible virus–host co-evolution in European bats. Since these novel viruses are related to the very distinct genera Rubulavirus and Jeilongvirus, a similarly broad genetic diversity among paramyxoviruses in other Microchiroptera compared to Megachiroptera can be assumed. Given that the infected bats were either found in close proximity to heavily populated human habitation or areas of intensive agricultural use, a potential risk of the emergence of zoonotic paramyxoviruses in Europe needs to be considered.","Kurth, Andreas; Kohl, Claudia; Brinkmann, Annika; Ebinger, Arnt; Harper, Jennifer A.; Wang, Lin-Fa; Mühldorfer, Kristin; Wibbelt, Gudrun",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3380927/,15
886,Deciphering Novel Host–Herpesvirus Interactions by Virion Proteomics,2012-05-28,"Over the years, a vast array of information concerning the interactions of viruses with their hosts has been collected. However, recent advances in proteomics and other system biology techniques suggest these interactions are far more complex than anticipated. One particularly interesting and novel aspect is the analysis of cellular proteins incorporated into mature virions. Though sometimes considered purification contaminants in the past, their repeated detection by different laboratories suggests that a number of these proteins are bona fide viral components, some of which likely contribute to the viral life cycles. The present mini review focuses on cellular proteins detected in herpesviruses. It highlights the common cellular functions of these proteins, their potential implications for host–pathogen interactions, discusses technical limitations, the need for complementing methods and probes potential future research avenues.","Lippé, Roger",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3390586/,15
891,"Production, Characterization and Applications for Toxoplasma gondii-Specific Polyclonal Chicken Egg Yolk Immunoglobulins",2012-07-12,"BACKGROUND: Toxoplasma gondii may cause abortions, ocular and neurological disorders in warm-blood hosts. Immunized mammals are a wide source of hyperimmune sera used in different approaches, including diagnosis and the study of host-parasite interactions. Unfortunately, mammalian antibodies present limitations for its production, such as the necessity for animal bleeding, low yield, interference with rheumatoid factor, complement activation and affinity to Fc mammalian receptors. IgY antibodies avoid those limitations; therefore they could be an alternative to be applied in T. gondii model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we immunized hens with soluble tachyzoite antigens of T. gondii (STAg) and purified egg yolk antibodies (IgY) by an inexpensive and simple method, with high yield and purity degree. IgY anti-STAg antibodies presented high avidity and were able to recognize a broad range of parasite antigens, although some marked differences were observed in reactivity profile between antibodies produced in immunized hens and mice. Interestingly, IgY antibodies against Neospora caninum and Eimeria spp. did not react to STAg. We also show that IgY antibodies were suitable to detect T. gondii forms in paraffin-embedded sections and culture cell monolayers. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Due to its cost-effectiveness, high production yield and varied range of possible applications, polyclonal IgY antibodies are useful tools for studies involving T. gondii.","Ferreira Júnior, Álvaro; Santiago, Fernanda M.; Silva, Murilo V.; Ferreira, Flávia B.; Macêdo Júnior, Arlindo G.; Mota, Caroline M.; Faria, Matheus S.; Filho, Hercílio H.

901,Molecular and Microscopic Analysis of Bacteria and Viruses in Exhaled Breath Collected Using a Simple Impaction and Condensing Method,2012-07-25,"Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is increasingly being used as a non-invasive method for disease diagnosis and environmental exposure assessment. By using hydrophobic surface, ice, and droplet scavenging, a simple impaction and condensing based collection method is reported here. Human subjects were recruited to exhale toward the device for 1, 2, 3, and 4 min. The exhaled breath quickly formed into tiny droplets on the hydrophobic surface, which were subsequently scavenged into a 10 µL rolling deionized water droplet. The collected EBC was further analyzed using culturing, DNA stain, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and colorimetry (VITEK 2) for bacteria and viruses. Experimental data revealed that bacteria and viruses in EBC can be rapidly collected using the method developed here, with an observed efficiency of 100 µL EBC within 1 min. Culturing, DNA stain, SEM, and qPCR methods all detected high bacterial concentrations up to 7000 CFU/m(3) in exhaled breath, including both viable and dead cells of various types. Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Kocuria variants were found dominant in EBC samples using VITEK 2 system. SEM images revealed that most bacteria in exhaled breath are detected in the size range of 0.5–1.0 µm, which is able to enable them to remain airborne for a longer time, thus presenting a risk for airborne transmission of potential diseases. Using qPCR, influenza A H3N2 viruses were also detected in one EBC sample. Different from other devices restricted solely to condensation, the developed method can be easily achieved both by impaction and condensation in a laboratory and could impact current practice of EBC collection. Nonetheless, the reported work is a proof-of-concept demonstration, and its performance in non-invasive disease diagnosis such as bacterimia and virus infections needs to be further validated including effects of its influencing matrix.","Xu, Zhenqiang; Shen, Fangxia; Li, Xiaoguang; Wu, Yan; Chen, Qi; Jie, Xu; Yao, Maosheng",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3405091/,15
1114,Regulation of the Epithelial Adhesion Molecule CEACAM1 Is Important for Palate Formation,2013-04-17,"Cleft palate results from a mixture of genetic and environmental factors and occurs when the bilateral palatal shelves fail to fuse. The objective of this study was to search for new genes involved in mouse palate formation. Gene expression of murine embryonic palatal tissue was analyzed at various developmental stages before, during, and after palate fusion using GeneChip® microarrays. Ceacam1 was one of the highly up-regulated genes during palate formation, and this was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CEACAM1 was present in prefusion palatal epithelium and was degraded during fusion. To investigate the developmental role of CEACAM1, function-blocking antibody was added to embryonic mouse palate in organ culture. Palatal fusion was inhibited by this function-blocking antibody. To investigate the subsequent developmental role of CEACAM1, we characterized Ceacam1-deficient (Ceacam1 (−/−)) mice. Epithelial cells persisted abnormally at the midline of the embryonic palate even on day E16.0, and palatal fusion was delayed in Ceacam1 (−/−) mice. TGFβ3 expression, apoptosis, and cell proliferation in palatal epithelium were not affected in the palate of Ceacam1(−/−)mice. However, CEACAM1 expression was retained in the remaining MEE of TGFβ-deficient mice. These results suggest that CEACAM1 has roles in the initiation of palatal fusion via epithelial cell adhesion.","Mima, Junko; Koshino, Aya; Oka, Kyoko; Uchida, Hitoshi; Hieda, Yohki; Nohara, Kanji; Kogo, Mikihiko; Chai, Yang; Sakai, Takayoshi",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3629100/,15
1146,Recombinant Vaccines against T. gondii: Comparison between Homologous and Heterologous Vaccination Protocols Using Two Viral Vectors Expressing SAG1,2013-05-15,"The use of recombinant viral vectors expressing T. gondii antigens is a safe and efficient approach to induce immune response against the parasite and a valuable tool for vaccine development. We have previously protected mice from toxoplasmosis by immunizing the animals with an adenovirus expressing the protein SAG1 (AdSAG1) of T. gondii. We are now looking for ways to improve the vaccination strategy and enhance protection. One limitation of homologous vaccinations (sequential doses of the same vector) is induction of anti-vector immune response that blocks cell transduction, restricts transgene expression and, consequently, compromises the overall outcome of vaccination. One way to avert the effects of anti-vector response is to use different viruses in prime and boost (heterologous vaccination). Bearing this in mind, we generated a modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara encoding SAG1 (MVASAG1), to be tested as boost agent after prime with AdSAG1. Although minor differences were observed in the magnitude of the anti-SAG1 immune response induced by each vaccination protocol, the heterologous immunization with AdSAG1 followed by MVASAG1 resulted in improved capacity to control brain cyst formation in a model of chronic toxoplasmosis in C57BL/6 mice.","Mendes, Érica Araújo; Fonseca, Flavio G.; Casério, Bárbara M.; Colina, Janaína P.; Gazzinelli, Ricardo Tostes; Caetano, Braulia C.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3654925/,15
1483,Silver Sucrose Octasulfate (IASOS™) as a Valid Active Ingredient into a Novel Vaginal Gel against Human Vaginal Pathogens: In Vitro Antimicrobial Activity Assessment,2014-06-04,"This in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of Sucrose Octasulfate (IASOS) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing IASOS (SilSOS Femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. In BHI and LAPT culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different pHs were tested. IASOS exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. The results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced IASOS efficacy only to a moderate extent. Whereas comparable MBCs (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) were observed for G. vaginalis (10 mg/L Ag(+)), E. coli and E. aerogenes (25 mg/L Ag(+)) in both media, higher MBCs were found for S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT cultures (50 mg/L Ag(+) versus 25 mg/L Ag(+)). No minimal concentration totally inhibiting the growth of C. albicans was found. Nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50–200 mg/L Ag(+)), a significant 34–52% drop in Candida growth was observed. pH differently affected the antimicrobial properties of IASOS against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at pH higher than the physiological pH was generally observed. It can be therefore concluded that IASOS exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against C. albicans. The antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel SilSOS Femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of IASOS. Overall, our findings support IASOS as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.","Marianelli, Cinzia; Petrucci, Paola; Comelli, Maria Cristina; Calderini, Gabriella",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4045761/,15
1577,Characterisation of novel microRNAs in the Black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) by deep sequencing,2014-08-15,"BACKGROUND: Bats are a major source of new and emerging viral diseases. Despite the fact that bats carry and shed highly pathogenic viruses including Ebola, Nipah and SARS, they rarely display clinical symptoms of infection. Host factors influencing viral replication are poorly understood in bats and are likely to include both pre- and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. MicroRNAs are a major mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation, however very little is known about them in bats. RESULTS: This study describes 399 microRNAs identified by deep sequencing of small RNA isolated from tissues of the Black flying fox, Pteropus alecto, a confirmed natural reservoir of the human pathogens Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus. Of the microRNAs identified, more than 100 are unique amongst vertebrates, including a subset containing mutations in critical seed regions. Clusters of rapidly-evolving microRNAs were identified, as well as microRNAs predicted to target genes involved in antiviral immunity, the DNA damage response, apoptosis and autophagy. Closer inspection of the predicted targets for several highly supported novel miRNA candidates suggests putative roles in host-virus interaction. CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNAs are likely to play major roles in regulating virus-host interaction in bats, via dampening of inflammatory responses (limiting the effects of immunopathology), and directly limiting the extent of viral replication, either through restricting the availability of essential factors or by controlling apoptosis. Characterisation of the bat microRNA repertoire is an essential step towards understanding transcriptional regulation during viral infection, and will assist in the identification of mechanisms that enable bats to act as natural virus reservoirs. This in turn will facilitate the development of antiviral strategies for use in humans and other species.

1617,Functional ultrastructure of the plant nucleolus,2014-04-23,"Nucleoli are nuclear domains present in almost all eukaryotic cells. They not only specialize in the production of ribosomal subunits but also play roles in many fundamental cellular activities. Concerning ribosome biosynthesis, particular stages of this process, i.e., ribosomal DNA transcription, primary RNA transcript processing, and ribosome assembly proceed in precisely defined nucleolar subdomains. Although eukaryotic nucleoli are conservative in respect of their main function, clear morphological differences between these structures can be noticed between individual kingdoms. In most cases, a plant nucleolus shows well-ordered structure in which four main ultrastructural components can be distinguished: fibrillar centers, dense fibrillar component, granular component, and nucleolar vacuoles. Nucleolar chromatin is an additional crucial structural component of this organelle. Nucleolonema, although it is not always an unequivocally distinguished nucleolar domain, has often been described as a well-grounded morphological element, especially of plant nucleoli. The ratios and morphology of particular subcompartments of a nucleolus can change depending on its metabolic activity which in turn is correlated with the physiological state of a cell, cell type, cell cycle phase, as well as with environmental influence. Precise attribution of functions to particular nucleolar subregions in the process of ribosome biosynthesis is now possible using various approaches. The presented description of plant nucleolar morphology summarizes previous knowledge regarding the function of nucleoli as well as of their particular subdomains not only in the course of ribosome biosynthesis.","Stępiński, Dariusz",Protoplasma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4209244/,15
1630,Specificity and Effector Functions of Human RSV-Specific IgG from Bovine Milk,2014-11-06,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the second most important cause of death in the first year of life, and early RSV infections are associated with the development of asthma. Breastfeeding and serum IgG have been shown to protect against RSV infection. Yet, many infants depend on bovine milk-based nutrition, which at present lacks intact immunoglobulins. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether IgG purified from bovine milk (bIgG) can modulate immune responses against human RSV. METHODS: ELISAs were performed to analyse binding of bIgG to human respiratory pathogens. bIgG or hRSV was coated to plates to assess dose-dependent binding of bIgG to human Fcγ receptors (FcγR) or bIgG-mediated binding of myeloid cells to hRSV respectively. S. Epidermidis and RSV were used to test bIgG-mediated binding and internalisation of pathogens by myeloid cells. Finally, the ability of bIgG to neutralise infection of HEp2 cells by hRSV was evaluated. RESULTS: bIgG recognised human RSV, influenza haemagglutinin and Haemophilus influenza. bIgG bound to FcγRII on neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages, but not to FcγRI and FcγRIII, and could bind simultaneously to hRSV and human FcγRII on neutrophils. In addition, human neutrophils and dendritic cells internalised pathogens that were opsonised with bIgG. Finally, bIgG could prevent infection of HEp2 cells by hRSV. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here show that bIgG binds to hRSV and other human respiratory pathogens and induces effector functions through binding to human FcγRII on phagocytes. Thus bovine IgG may contribute to immune protection against RSV.","den Hartog, Gerco; Jacobino, Shamir; Bont, Louis; Cox, Linda; Ulfman, Laurien H.; Leusen, Jeanette H. W.; van Neerven, R. J.

1690,Characterizing the Transmission Dynamics and Control of Ebola Virus Disease,2015-01-21,"Carefully calibrated transmission models have the potential to guide public health officials on the nature and scale of the interventions required to control epidemics. In the context of the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Liberia, Drake and colleagues, in this issue of PLOS Biology, employed an elegant modeling approach to capture the distributions of the number of secondary cases that arise in the community and health care settings in the context of changing population behaviors and increasing hospital capacity. Their findings underscore the role of increasing the rate of safe burials and the fractions of infectious individuals who seek hospitalization together with hospital capacity to achieve epidemic control. However, further modeling efforts of EVD transmission and control in West Africa should utilize the spatial-temporal patterns of spread in the region by incorporating spatial heterogeneity in the transmission process. Detailed datasets are urgently needed to characterize temporal changes in population behaviors, contact networks at different spatial scales, population mobility patterns, adherence to infection control measures in hospital settings, and hospitalization and reporting rates.","Chowell, Gerardo; Nishiura, Hiroshi",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4301953/,15
1856,"The venomous cocktail of the vampire snail Colubraria reticulata (Mollusca, Gastropoda)",2015-06-09,"BACKGROUND: Hematophagy arose independently multiple times during metazoan evolution, with several lineages of vampire animals particularly diversified in invertebrates. However, the biochemistry of hematophagy has been studied in a few species of direct medical interest and is still underdeveloped in most invertebrates, as in general is the study of venom toxins. In cone snails, leeches, arthropods and snakes, the strong target specificity of venom toxins uniquely aligns them to industrial and academic pursuits (pharmacological applications, pest control etc.) and provides a biochemical tool for studying biological activities including cell signalling and immunological response. Neogastropod snails (cones, oyster drills etc.) are carnivorous and include active predators, scavengers, grazers on sessile invertebrates and hematophagous parasites; most of them use venoms to efficiently feed. It has been hypothesized that trophic innovations were the main drivers of rapid radiation of Neogastropoda in the late Cretaceous. We present here the first molecular characterization of the alimentary secretion of a non-conoidean neogastropod, Colubraria reticulata. Colubrariids successfully feed on the blood of fishes, throughout the secretion into the host of a complex mixture of anaesthetics and anticoagulants. We used a NGS RNA-Seq approach, integrated with differential expression analyses and custom searches for putative secreted feeding-related proteins, to describe in detail the salivary and mid-oesophageal transcriptomes of this Mediterranean vampire snail, with functional and evolutionary insights on major families of bioactive molecules. RESULTS: A remarkably low level of overlap was observed between the gene expression in the two target tissues, which also contained a high percentage of putatively secreted proteins when compared to the whole body. At least 12 families of feeding-related proteins were identified, including: 1) anaesthetics, such as ShK Toxin-containing proteins and turripeptides (ion-channel blockers), Cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs), Adenosine Deaminase (ADA); 2) inhibitors of primary haemostasis, such as novel vWFA domain-containing proteins, the Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 5 (ENPP5) and the wasp Antigen-5; 3) anticoagulants, such as TFPI-like multiple Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, Peptidases S1 (PS1), CAP/ShKT domain-containing proteins, Astacin metalloproteases and Astacin/ShKT domain-containing proteins; 4) additional proteins, such the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE: vasopressive) and the cytolytic Porins. CONCLUSIONS: Colubraria feeding physiology seems to involve inhibitors of both primary and secondary haemostasis, anaesthetics, a vasoconstrictive enzyme to reduce feeding time and tissue-degrading proteins such as Porins and Astacins. The complexity of Colubraria venomous cocktail and the divergence from the arsenal of the few neogastropods studied to date (mostly conoideans) suggest that biochemical diversification of neogastropods might be largely underestimated and worth of extensive investigation.

1933,Inhibitory effects of magnolol and honokiol on human calcitonin aggregation,2015-09-01,"Amyloid formation is associated with multiple amyloidosis diseases. Human calcitonin (hCT) is a typical amyloidogenic peptide, its aggregation is associated with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC), and also limits its clinical application. Magnolia officinalis is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine; its two major polyphenol components, magnolol (Mag) and honokiol (Hon), have displayed multiple functions. Polyphenols like flavonoids and their derivatives have been extensively studied as amyloid inhibitors. However, the anti-amyloidogenic property of a biphenyl backbone containing polyphenols such as Mag and Hon has not been reported. In this study, these two compounds were tested for their effects on hCT aggregation. We found that Mag and Hon both inhibited the amyloid formation of hCT, whereas Mag showed a stronger inhibitory effect; moreover, they both dose-dependently disassembled preformed hCT aggregates. Further immuno-dot blot and dynamic light scattering studies suggested Mag and Hon suppressed the aggregation of hCT both at the oligomerization and the fibrillation stages, while MTT-based and dye-leakage assays demonstrated that Mag and Hon effectively reduced cytotoxicity caused by hCT aggregates. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry indicated Mag and Hon both interact with hCT. Together, our study suggested a potential anti-amyloidogenic property of these two compounds and their structure related derivatives.","Guo, Caiao; Ma, Liang; Zhao, Yudan; Peng, Anlin; Cheng, Biao; Zhou, Qiaoqiao; Zheng, Ling; Huang, Kun",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4555095/,15
1938,Targeted Collection of Plasmid DNA in Large and Growing Animal Muscles 6 Weeks after DNA Vaccination with and without Electroporation,2015-08-25,"DNA vaccination has been developed in the last two decades in human and animal species as a promising alternative to conventional vaccination. It consists in the injection, in the muscle, for example, of plasmid DNA encoding the vaccinating polypeptide. Electroporation which forces the entrance of the plasmid DNA in cells at the injection point has been described as a powerful and promising strategy to enhance DNA vaccine efficacy. Due to the fact that the vaccine is composed of DNA, close attention on the fate of the plasmid DNA upon vaccination has to be taken into account, especially at the injection point. To perform such studies, the muscle injection point has to be precisely recovered and collected several weeks after injection. This is even more difficult for large and growing animals. A technique has been developed to localize precisely and collect efficiently the muscle injection points in growing piglets 6 weeks after DNA vaccination accompanied or not by electroporation. Electroporation did not significantly increase the level of remaining plasmids compared to nonelectroporated piglets, and, in all the cases, the levels were below the limit recommended by the FDA to research integration events of plasmid DNA into the host DNA.","Dory, Daniel; Le Moigne, Vincent; Cariolet, Roland; Béven, Véronique; Keranflec'h, André; Jestin, André",J Immunol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4561992/,15
1961,A Multiple siRNA-Based Anti-HIV/SHIV Microbicide Shows Protection in Both In Vitro and In Vivo Models,2015-09-25,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) are the etiologic agents of AIDS. Most HIV-1 infected individuals worldwide are women, who acquire HIV infections during sexual contact. Blocking HIV mucosal transmission and local spread in the female lower genital tract is important in preventing infection and ultimately eliminating the pandemic. Microbicides work by destroying the microbes or preventing them from establishing an infection. Thus, a number of different types of microbicides are under investigation, however, the lack of their solubility and bioavailability, and toxicity has been major hurdles. Herein, we report the development of multifunctional chitosan-lipid nanocomplexes that can effectively deliver plasmids encoding siRNA(s) as microbicides without adverse effects and provide significant protection against HIV in both in vitro and in vivo models. Chitosan or chitosan-lipid (chlipid) was complexed with a cocktail of plasmids encoding HIV-1-specific siRNAs (psiRNAs) and evaluated for their efficacy in HEK-293 cells, PBMCs derived from nonhuman primates, 3-dimensional human vaginal ectocervical tissue (3D-VEC) model and also in non-human primate model. Moreover, prophylactic administration of the chlipid to deliver a psiRNA cocktail intravaginally with a cream formulation in a non-human primate model showed substantial reduction of SHIV (simian/human immunodeficiency virus SF162) viral titers. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the potential of chlipid-siRNA nanocomplexes as a potential genetic microbicide against HIV infections.","Boyapalle, Sandhya; Xu, Weidong; Raulji, Payal; Mohapatra, Subhra; Mohapatra, Shyam S",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4583459/,15
2066,Recent Progress towards Novel EV71 Anti-Therapeutics and Vaccines,2015-12-08,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a group of viruses that belongs to the Picornaviridae family, which also includes viruses such as polioviruses. EV71, together with coxsackieviruses, is widely known for its association with Hand Foot Mouth Disease (HFMD), which generally affects children age five and below. Besides HFMD, EV71 can also trigger more severe and life-threatening neurological conditions such as encephalitis. Considering the lack of a vaccine and antiviral drug against EV71, together with the increasing spread of these viruses, the development of such drugs and vaccines becomes the top priority in protecting our younger generations. This article, hence, reviews some of the recent progress in the formulations of anti-therapeutics and vaccine generation for EV71, covering (i) inactivated vaccines; (ii) baculovirus-expressed vaccines against EV71; (iii) human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment; and (iv) the use of monoclonal antibody therapy as a prevention and treatment for EV71 infections.","Ng, Qingyong; He, Fang; Kwang, Jimmy",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4690872/,15
2075,Lys-315 at the Interfaces of Diagonal Subunits of δ-Crystallin Plays a Critical Role in the Reversibility of Folding and Subunit Assembly,2016-01-05,"δ-Crystallin is the major structural protein in avian eye lenses and is homologous to the urea cycle enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. This protein is structurally assembled as double dimers. Lys-315 is the only residue which is arranged symmetrically at the diagonal subunit interfaces to interact with each other. This study found that wild-type protein had both dimers and monomers present in 2–4 M urea whilst only monomers of the K315A mutant were observed under the same conditions, as judged by sedimentation velocity analysis. The assembly of monomeric K315A mutant was reversible in contrast to wild-type protein. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the dissociation of primary dimers is prior to the diagonal dimers in wild-type protein. These results suggest the critical role of Lys-315 in stabilization of the diagonal dimer structure. Guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) denatured wild-type or K315A mutant protein did not fold into functional protein. However, the urea dissociated monomers of K315A mutant protein in GdmCl were reversible folding through a multiple steps mechanism as measured by tryptophan and ANS fluorescence. Two partly unfolded intermediates were detected in the pathway. Refolding of the intermediates resulted in a conformation with greater amounts of hydrophobic regions exposed which was prone to the formation of protein aggregates. The formation of aggregates was not prevented by the addition of α-crystallin. These results highlight that the conformational status of the monomers is critical for determining whether reversible oligomerization or aggregate formation occurs.","Huang, Chih-Wei; Lin, Hui-Chen; Chou, Chi-Yuan; Kao, Wei-Chuo; Chou, Wei-Yuan; Lee, Hwei-Jen",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4701392/,15
2097,Genetic diversity of Culex pipiens mosquitoes in distinct populations from Europe: contribution of Cx. quinquefasciatus in Mediterranean populations,2016-01-27,"BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes of the Culex pipiens complex are cosmopolitan, and important vectors of neglected tropical diseases, such as arbovirosis and lymphatic filariasis. Among the complex taxa, Cx. pipiens (with two forms pipiens and molestus) and Cx. quinquefasciatus are the most ubiquitous mosquitoes in temperate and tropical regions respectively. Mosquitoes of this taxa lack of morphological differences between females, but have frank behavioral and physiological differences and have different trophic preferences that influence their vectorial status. Hybridization may change the vectorial capacity of these mosquitoes, increasing vector efficiency and medical importance of resulting hybrids. METHODS: Culex pipiens s.l. from 35 distinct populations were investigated by the study of mtDNA, symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis, nuclear DNA and flanking region of microsatellite CQ11 polymorphism using PCR with diagnostic primers, RFLP analysis and sequencing. RESULTS: Six different mitochondrial haplotypes were revealed by sequencing of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and three different Wolbachia (wPip) groups were identified. A strong association was observed between COI haplotypes/groups, wPip groups and taxa; haplogroup A and infection with wPipII appear to be typical for Cx. pipiens form pipiens, haplotype D and infection with wPipIV for form molestus, while haplogroup E, characteristic of Cx. quinquefasciatus, were correlated with wPipI and found in Cx. pipiens sl. from coastal regions of Southern Europe and Mediterranean region. Analysis of microsatellite locus and nuclear DNA revealed hybrids between Cx. pipiens form pipiens and form molestus, as well as between Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus, in Mediterranean populations, as opposed to Northern Europe. Phylogenetic analysis of COI sequences yielded a tree topology that supported the RFLP analysis with significant bootstrap values for haplotype D and haplogroup E. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular identification provides the first evidence of the presence of hybrids between Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens as well as cytoplasmic introgression of Cx. quinquefasciatus into Cx. pipiens as a result of hybridization events in coastal regions of Southern Europe and Mediterranean region. Together with observed hybrids between pipiens and molestus forms, these findings point to the presence of hybrids in these areas, with consequent higher potential for disease transmission.

2194,Finite Element Analysis on Nanomechanical Detection of Small Particles: Toward Virus Detection,2016-04-14,"Detection of small particles, including viruses and particulate matter (PM), has been attracting much attention in light of increasing need for environmental monitoring. Owing to their high versatility, a nanomechanical sensor is one of the most promising sensors which can be adapted to various monitoring systems. In this study, we present an optimization strategy to efficiently detect small particles with nanomechanical sensors. Adsorption of particles on the receptor layer of nanomechanical sensors and the resultant signal are analyzed using finite element analysis (FEA). We investigate the effect of structural parameters (e.g., adsorption position and embedded depth of a particle and thickness of the receptor layer) and elastic properties of the receptor layer (e.g., Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) on the sensitivity. It is found that a membrane-type surface stress sensors (MSS) has the potential for robust detection of small particles.","Imamura, Gaku; Shiba, Kota; Yoshikawa, Genki",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4830830/,15
2345,Self-Amplifying mRNA Vaccines Expressing Multiple Conserved Influenza Antigens Confer Protection against Homologous and Heterosubtypic Viral Challenge,2016-08-15,"Current hemagglutinin (HA)-based seasonal influenza vaccines induce vaccine strain-specific neutralizing antibodies that usually fail to provide protection against mismatched circulating viruses. Inclusion in the vaccine of highly conserved internal proteins such as the nucleoprotein (NP) and the matrix protein 1 (M1) was shown previously to increase vaccine efficacy by eliciting cross-reactive T-cells. However, appropriate delivery systems are required for efficient priming of T-cell responses. In this study, we demonstrated that administration of novel self-amplifying mRNA (SAM(®)) vectors expressing influenza NP (SAM(NP)), M1 (SAM(M1)), and NP and M1 (SAM(M1-NP)) delivered with lipid nanoparticles (LNP) induced robust polyfunctional CD4 T helper 1 cells, while NP-containing SAM also induced cytotoxic CD8 T cells. Robust expansions of central memory (T(CM)) and effector memory (T(EM)) CD4 and CD8 T cells were also measured. An enhanced recruitment of NP-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells was observed in the lungs of SAM(NP)-immunized mice after influenza infection that paralleled with reduced lung viral titers and pathology, and increased survival after homologous and heterosubtypic influenza challenge. Finally, we demonstrated for the first time that the co-administration of RNA (SAM(M1-NP)) and protein (monovalent inactivated influenza vaccine (MIIV)) was feasible, induced simultaneously NP-, M1- and HA-specific T cells and HA-specific neutralizing antibodies, and enhanced MIIV efficacy against a heterologous challenge. In conclusion, systemic administration of SAM vectors expressing conserved internal influenza antigens induced protective immune responses in mice, supporting the SAM(®) platform as another promising strategy for the development of broad-spectrum universal influenza vaccines.","Magini, Diletta; Giovani, Cinzia; Mangiavacchi, Simona; Maccari, Silvia; Cecchi, Raffaella; Ulmer, Jeffrey B.; De Gregorio, Ennio; Geall, Andrew J.; Brazzoli, Michela; Bertholet, Sylvie",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4985159/,15

Because UV illumination is hazardous to humans, visible light-responsive photocatalysts (VLRPs) were discovered and are now applied to increase photocatalysis. However, fundamental questions regarding the ability of VLRPs to trigger DNA mutations and the mutation types it elicits remain elusive. Here, through plasmid transformation and β-galactosidase α-complementation analyses, we observed that visible light-responsive platinum-containing titania (TiO(2)) nanoparticle (NP)-mediated photocatalysis considerably reduces the number of Escherichia coli transformants. This suggests that such photocatalytic reactions cause DNA damage. DNA sequencing results demonstrated that the DNA damage comprises three mutation types, namely nucleotide insertion, deletion and substitution; this is the first study to report the types of mutations occurring after photocatalysis by TiO(2)-VLRPs. Our results may facilitate the development and appropriate use of new-generation TiO(2) NPs for biomedical applications.","Sun, Der-Shan; Tseng, Yao-Hsuan; Wu, Wen-Shiang; Wong, Ming-Show; Chang, Hsin-Hou",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5295192/,15
2630,The SRL peptide of Rhesus Rotavirus VP4 protein governs cholangiocyte infection and the murine model of biliary atresia,2017-01-10,"Biliary atresia (BA) is a neonatal obstructive cholangiopathy which progresses to end stage liver disease, often requiring transplantation. The murine model of BA, employing rhesus rotavirus (RRV), parallels human disease and has been used to elucidate mechanistic aspects of a virus induced biliary cholangiopathy. We previously reported that RRV VP4 gene plays an integral role in activating the immune system and induction of BA. Utilizing rotavirus binding and blocking assays, this study elucidated how RRV VP4 protein governs cholangiocyte susceptibility to infection both in vitro and in vivo in the murine model of BA. We identified the amino acid sequence on VP4 and its cholangiocyte binding protein, finding that the sequence is specific to those rotavirus strains which cause an obstructive cholangiopathy. Pretreatment of murine and human cholangiocytes with this VP4 derived peptide (TRTRVSRLY), significantly reduced RRV’s ability to bind and infect the cells. However, the peptide did not block cholangiocyte binding of TUCH and Ro1845, strains which do not induce murine BA. The SRL sequence within TRTRVSRLY is required for cholangiocyte binding and viral replication. The cholangiocyte membrane protein bound by SRL was found to be Hsc70. Inhibition of Hsc70 by siRNAs reduced RRV’s ability to infect cholangiocytes. This virus-cholangiocyte interaction is also seen in vivo in the murine model of BA, where inoculation of mice with TRTRVSRLY peptide significantly reduced symptoms and mortality in RRV-injected mice. CONCLUSION: The tri-peptide SRL on RRV VP4 binds to the cholangiocyte membrane protein Hsc70 defining a novel binding site governing VP4 attachment. Investigations are underway to determine the cellular response following this interaction to understand how it contributes to the pathogenesis of BA.","Mohanty, Sujit K.; Donnelly, Bryan; Lobeck, Inna; Walther, Ashley; Dupree, Phylicia; Coots, Abigail; Meller, Jaroslaw; McNeal, Monica; Sestak, Karol; Tiao, Greg",Hepatology,https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/hep.28947,15
2748,Prediction of lncRNA-protein interactions using HeteSim scores based on heterogeneous networks,2017-06-16,"Massive studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical for the regulation of cellular biological processes by binding with RNA-related proteins. However, only a few experimentally supported lncRNA-protein associations have been reported. Existing network-based methods are typically focused on intrinsic features of lncRNA and protein but ignore the information implicit in the topologies of biological networks associated with lncRNAs. Considering the limitations in previous methods, we propose PLPIHS, an effective computational method for Predicting lncRNA-Protein Interactions using HeteSim Scores. PLPIHS uses the HeteSim measure to calculate the relatedness score for each lncRNA-protein pair in the heterogeneous network, which consists of lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, lncRNA-protein association network and protein-protein interaction network. An SVM classifier to predict lncRNA-protein interactions is built with the HeteSim scores. The results show that PLPIHS performs significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art approaches and achieves an AUC score of 0.97 in the leave-one-out validation test. We also compare the performances of networks with different connectivity density and find that PLPIHS performs well across all the networks. Furthermore, we use the proposed method to identify the related proteins for lncRNA MALAT1. Highly-ranked proteins are verified by the biological studies and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","Xiao, Yun; Zhang, Jingpu; Deng, Lei",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473862/,15

Zika NS2B-NS3pro is essential for the proteolysis of the viral polyprotein and thereby viral replication. Thus NS2B-NS3pro represents an attractive target for anti-Zika drug discovery/design. Here, we have characterized the solution conformations and catalytic parameters of both linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes and found that the unlinked complex manifested well-dispersed NMR spectra. Subsequently with selective isotope-labeling using NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrated that C-terminal residues (R73-K100) of NS2B is highly disordered without any stable tertiary and secondary structures in the Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex in the free state. Upon binding to the well-characterized serine protease inhibitor, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), only the extreme C-terminal residues (L86-K100) remain disordered. Additionally, we have identified five flavonoids and one natural phenol rich in edible plants including fruits and vegetables, which inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro in a non-competitive mode, with Ki ranging from 770 nM for Myricetin to 34.02 μM for Apigenin. Molecular docking showed that they all bind to a pocket on the back of the active site and their structure-activity relationship was elucidated. Our study provides valuable insights into the solution conformation of Zika NS2B-NS3pro and further deciphers its susceptibility towards allosteric inhibition by natural products. As these natural product inhibitors fundamentally differ from the currently-known active site inhibitors in terms of both inhibitory mode and chemical scaffold, our finding might open a new avenue for development of better allosteric inhibitors to fight ZIKV infection.","Roy, Amrita; Lim, Liangzhong; Srivastava, Shagun; Lu, Yimei; Song, Jianxing",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5503262/,15

2942,In vivo protection against ZIKV infection and pathogenesis through passive antibody transfer and active immunisation with a prMEnv DNA vaccine,2016-11-10,"Significant concerns have been raised owing to the rapid global spread of infection and disease caused by the mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV). Recent studies suggest that ZIKV can also be transmitted sexually, further increasing the exposure risk for this virus. Associated with this spread is a dramatic increase in cases of microcephaly and additional congenital abnormalities in infants of ZIKV-infected mothers, as well as a rise in the occurrence of Guillain Barre’ syndrome in infected adults. Importantly, there are no licensed therapies or vaccines against ZIKV infection. In this study, we generate and evaluate the in vivo efficacy of a novel, synthetic, DNA vaccine targeting the pre-membrane+envelope proteins (prME) of ZIKV. Following initial in vitro development and evaluation studies of the plasmid construct, mice and non-human primates were immunised with this prME DNA-based immunogen through electroporation-mediated enhanced DNA delivery. Vaccinated animals were found to generate antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity and neutralisation activity. In mice lacking receptors for interferon (IFN)-α/β (designated IFNAR(−/−)) immunisation with this DNA vaccine induced, following in vivo viral challenge, 100% protection against infection-associated weight loss or death in addition to preventing viral pathology in brain tissue. In addition, passive transfer of non-human primate anti-ZIKV immune serum protected IFNAR(−/−) mice against subsequent viral challenge. This study in NHP and in a pathogenic mouse model supports the importance of immune responses targeting prME in ZIKV infection and suggests that additional research on this vaccine approach may have relevance for ZIKV control and disease prevention in humans.","Muthumani, Karuppiah; Griffin, Bryan D; Agarwal, Sangya; Kudchodkar, Sagar B; Reuschel, Emma L; Choi, Hyeree; Kraynyak, Kimberly A; Duperret, Elizabeth K; Keaton, Amelia Anne; Chung, Christopher; Kim, Yinho K; Booth, Stephanie A; Racine, Trina; Yan, Jian; Morrow, Matthew P; Jiang, Jingjing; Lee, Brian; Ramos, Stephanie; Broderick, Kate E; Reed, Charles C; Khan, Amir S; Humeau, Laurent; Ugen, Kenneth E; Park, Young K; Maslow, Joel N; Sardesai, Niranjan Y; Joseph Kim, J; Kobinger, Gary P; Weiner, David B",NPJ Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5707885/,15
3079,Lipid-Based Particles: Versatile Delivery Systems for Mucosal Vaccination against Infection,2018-03-07,"Vaccination is the process of administering immunogenic formulations in order to induce or harness antigen (Ag)-specific antibody and T cell responses in order to protect against infections. Important successes have been obtained in protecting individuals against many deleterious pathological situations after parenteral vaccination. However, one of the major limitations of the current vaccination strategies is the administration route that may not be optimal for the induction of immunity at the site of pathogen entry, i.e., mucosal surfaces. It is now well documented that immune responses along the genital, respiratory, or gastrointestinal tracts have to be elicited locally to ensure efficient trafficking of effector and memory B and T cells to mucosal tissues. Moreover, needle-free mucosal delivery of vaccines is advantageous in terms of safety, compliance, and ease of administration. However, the quest for mucosal vaccines is challenging due to (1) the fact that Ag sampling has to be performed across the epithelium through a relatively limited number of portals of entry; (2) the deleterious acidic and proteolytic environment of the mucosae that affect the stability, integrity, and retention time of the applied Ags; and (3) the tolerogenic environment of mucosae, which requires the addition of adjuvants to elicit efficient effector immune responses. Until now, only few mucosally applicable vaccine formulations have been developed and successfully tested. In animal models and clinical trials, the use of lipidic structures such as liposomes, virosomes, immune stimulating complexes, gas-filled microbubbles and emulsions has proven efficient for the mucosal delivery of associated Ags and the induction of local and systemic immune reponses. Such particles are suitable for mucosal delivery because they protect the associated payload from degradation and deliver concentrated amounts of Ags via specialized sampling cells (microfold cells) within the mucosal epithelium to underlying antigen-presenting cells. The review aims at summarizing recent development in the field of mucosal vaccination using lipid-based particles. The modularity ensured by tailoring the lipidic design and content of particles, and their known safety as already established in humans, make the continuing appraisal of these vaccine candidates a promising development in the field of targeted mucosal vaccination.","Corthésy, Blaise; Bioley, Gilles",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5845866/,15

This presents a unique opportunity to examine the genetics of spillover versus reservoir hosts. The dengue virus 2 (DENV2) - encoded protease cleaves human STING, reducing type I interferon production and boosting viral titers in humans. We find that both human and sylvatic (reservoir) dengue viruses universally cleave human STING, but not the STING of primates implicated as reservoir species. The special ability of dengue to cleave STING is thus specific to humans and a few closely related ape species. Conversion of residues 78/79 to the human-encoded ‘RG’ renders all primate (and mouse) STINGs sensitive to viral cleavage. Dengue viruses may have evolved to increase viral titers in the dense and vast human population, while maintaining decreased titers and pathogenicity in the more rare animals that serve as their sustaining reservoir in nature.","Stabell, Alex C; Meyerson, Nicholas R; Gullberg, Rebekah C; Gilchrist, Alison R; Webb, Kristofor J; Old, William M; Perera, Rushika; Sawyer, Sara L",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5860865/,15

3357,Using DNA metabarcoding for simultaneous inference of common vampire bat diet and population structure,2018-05-16,"Metabarcoding diet analysis has become a valuable tool in animal ecology; however, co‐amplified predator sequences are not generally used for anything other than to validate predator identity. Exemplified by the common vampire bat, we demonstrate the use of metabarcoding to infer predator population structure alongside diet assessments. Growing populations of common vampire bats impact human, livestock and wildlife health in Latin America through transmission of pathogens, such as lethal rabies viruses. Techniques to determine large‐scale variation in vampire bat diet and bat population structure would empower locality‐ and species‐specific projections of disease transmission risks. However, previously used methods are not cost‐effective and efficient for large‐scale applications. Using bloodmeal and faecal samples from common vampire bats from coastal, Andean and Amazonian regions of Peru, we showcase metabarcoding as a scalable tool to assess vampire bat population structure and feeding preferences. Dietary metabarcoding was highly effective, detecting vertebrate prey in 93.2% of the samples. Bats predominantly preyed on domestic animals, but fed on tapirs at one Amazonian site. In addition, we identified arthropods in 9.3% of samples, likely reflecting consumption of ectoparasites. Using the same data, we document mitochondrial geographic population structure in the common vampire bat in Peru. Such simultaneous inference of vampire bat diet and population structure can enable new insights into the interplay between vampire bat ecology and disease transmission risks. Importantly, the methodology can be incorporated into metabarcoding diet studies of other animals to couple information on diet and population structure.","Bohmann, Kristine; Gopalakrishnan, Shyam; Nielsen, Martin; Nielsen, Luisa dos Santos Bay; Jones, Gareth; Streicker, Daniel G.; Gilbert, M.

Recent studies of viral transmission have used genome sequence data to evaluate the number of particles transmitted between hosts, and the role of selection as it operates during the transmission process. However, the interpretation of sequence data describing transmission events is a challenging task. We here present a novel and comprehensive framework for using short-read sequence data to understand viral transmission events, designed for influenza virus, but adaptable to other viral species. Our approach solves multiple shortcomings of previous methods for this purpose; for example, we consider transmission as an event involving whole viruses, rather than sets of independent alleles. We demonstrate how selection during transmission and noisy sequence data may each affect naive inferences of the population bottleneck, accounting for these in our framework so as to achieve a correct inference. We identify circumstances in which selection for increased viral transmission may or may not be identified from data. Applying our method to experimental data in which transmission occurs in the presence of strong selection, we show that our framework grants a more quantitative insight into transmission events than previous approaches, inferring the bottleneck in a manner that accounts for selection, both for within-host virulence, and for inherent viral transmissibility. Our work provides new opportunities for studying transmission processes in influenza, and by extension, in other infectious diseases.","Lumby, Casper K.; Nene, Nuno R.; Illingworth, Christopher J.

3542,Plant-derived chimeric antibodies inhibit the invasion of human fibroblasts by Toxoplasma gondii,2018-12-11,"The parasite Toxoplasma gondii causes an opportunistic infection, that is, particularly severe in immunocompromised patients, infants, and neonates. Current antiparasitic drugs are teratogenic and cause hypersensitivity-based toxic side effects especially during prolonged treatment. Furthermore, the recent emergence of drug-resistant toxoplasmosis has reduced the therapeutic impact of such drugs. In an effort to develop recombinant antibodies as a therapeutic alternative, a panel of affinity-matured, T. gondii tachyzoite-specific single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies was selected by phage display and bioinformatic analysis. Further affinity optimization was attempted by introducing point mutations at hotspots within light chain complementarity-determining region 2. This strategy yielded four mutated scFv sequences and a parental scFv that were used to produce five mouse–human chimeric IgGs in Nicotiana benthamiana plants, with yields of 33–72 mg/kg of plant tissue. Immunological analysis confirmed the specific binding of these plant-derived antibodies to T. gondii tachyzoites, and in vitro efficacy was demonstrated by their ability to inhibit the invasion of human fibroblasts and impair parasite infectivity. These novel recombinant antibodies could therefore be suitable for the development of plant-derived immunotherapeutic interventions against toxoplasmosis.","Lim, Sherene Swee Yin; Chua, Kek Heng; Nölke, Greta; Spiegel, Holger; Goh, Wai Leong; Chow, Sek Chuen; Kee, Boon Pin; Fischer, Rainer; Schillberg, Stefan; Othman, Rofina Yasmin",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6294049/,15
3876,Protein quality control in the nucleolus safeguards recovery of epigenetic regulators after heat shock,2019-06-14,"Maintenance of epigenetic modifiers is of utmost importance to preserve the epigenome and consequently appropriate cellular functioning. Here, we analyzed Polycomb group protein (PcG) complex integrity in response to heat shock (HS). Upon HS, various Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC)1 and PRC2 subunits, including CBX proteins, but also other chromatin regulators, are found to accumulate in the nucleolus. In parallel, binding of PRC1/2 to target genes is strongly reduced, coinciding with a dramatic loss of H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 marks. Nucleolar-accumulated CBX proteins are immobile, but remarkably both CBX protein accumulation and loss of PRC1/2 epigenetic marks are reversible. This post-heat shock recovery of pan-nuclear CBX protein localization and reinstallation of epigenetic marks is HSP70 dependent. Our findings demonstrate that the nucleolus is an essential protein quality control center, which is indispensable for recovery of epigenetic regulators and maintenance of the epigenome after heat shock.","Azkanaz, Maria; Rodríguez López, Aida; de Boer, Bauke; Huiting, Wouter; Angrand, Pierre-Olivier; Vellenga, Edo; Kampinga, Harm H; Bergink, Steven; Martens, Joost HA; Schuringa, Jan Jacob; van den Boom, Vincent",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6570483/,15
3932,Biological Function and Application of Picornaviral 2B Protein: A New Target for Antiviral Drug Development,2019-06-04,"Picornaviruses are associated with acute and chronic diseases. The clinical manifestations of infections are often mild, but infections may also lead to respiratory symptoms, gastroenteritis, myocarditis, meningitis, hepatitis, and poliomyelitis, with serious impacts on human health and economic losses in animal husbandry. Thus far, research on picornaviruses has mainly focused on structural proteins such as VP1, whereas the non-structural protein 2B, which plays vital roles in the life cycle of the viruses and exhibits a viroporin or viroporin-like activity, has been overlooked. Viroporins are viral proteins containing at least one amphipathic α-helical structure, which oligomerizes to form transmembrane hydrophilic pores. In this review, we mainly summarize recent research data on the viroporin or viroporin-like activity of 2B proteins, which affects the biological function of the membrane, regulates cell death, and affects the host immune response. Considering these mechanisms, the potential application of the 2B protein as a candidate target for antiviral drug development is discussed, along with research challenges and prospects toward realizing a novel treatment strategy for picornavirus infections.","Li, Zengbin; Zou, Zixiao; Jiang, Zeju; Huang, Xiaotian; Liu, Qiong",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6630369/,15
3935,Cytolytic Perforin as an Adjuvant to Enhance the Immunogenicity of DNA Vaccines,2019-04-30,"DNA vaccines present one of the most cost-effective platforms to develop global vaccines, which have been tested for nearly three decades in preclinical and clinical settings with some success in the clinic. However, one of the major challenges for the development of DNA vaccines is their poor immunogenicity in humans, which has led to refinements in DNA delivery, dosage in prime/boost regimens and the inclusion of adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity. In this review, we focus on adjuvants that can enhance the immunogenicity of DNA encoded antigens and highlight the development of a novel cytolytic DNA platform encoding a truncated mouse perforin. The application of this innovative DNA technology has considerable potential in the development of effective vaccines.","Shrestha, Ashish C.; Wijesundara, Danushka K.; Masavuli, Makutiro G.; Mekonnen, Zelalem A.; Gowans, Eric J.; Grubor-Bauk, Branka",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6630607/,15
4042,Possible roles of monocytes/macrophages in response to elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV) infections in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus),2019-09-06,"Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus-hemorrhagic disease (EEHV-HD) is the primary cause of acute, highly fatal, hemorrhagic diseases in young Asian elephants. Although monocytopenia is frequently observed in EEHV-HD cases, the role monocytes play in EEHV-disease pathogenesis is unknown. This study seeks to explain the responses of monocytes/macrophages in the pathogenesis of EEHV-HD. Samples of blood, frozen tissues, and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from EEHV1A-HD, EEHV4-HD, co-infected EEHV1A and 4-HD, and EEHV-negative calves were analyzed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the persistent EEHV4-infected and EEHV-negative calves were also studied. The results showed increased infiltration of Iba-1-positive macrophages in the inflamed tissues of the internal organs of elephant calves with EEHV-HD. In addition, cellular apoptosis also increased in the tissues of elephants with EEHV-HD, especially in the PBMCs, compared to the EEHV-negative control. In the PBMCs of persistent EEHV4-infected elephants, cytokine mRNA expression was high, particularly up-regulation of TNF-α and IFN-γ. Moreover, viral particles were observed in the cytoplasm of the persistent EEHV4-infected elephant monocytes. Our study demonstrated for the first time that apoptosis of the PBMCs increased in cases of EEHV-HD. Furthermore, this study showed that monocytes may serve as a vehicle for viral dissemination during EEHV infection in Asian elephants.","Srivorakul, Saralee; Guntawang, Thunyamas; Kochagul, Varankpicha; Photichai, Kornravee; Sittisak, Tidaratt; Janyamethakul, Thittaya; Boonprasert, Khajohnpat; Khammesri, Siripat; Langkaphin, Warangkhana; Punyapornwithaya, Veerasak; Chuammitri, Phongsakorn; Thitaram, Chatchote; Pringproa, Kidsadagon",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6730851/,15
4102,TSEN54 missense variant in Standard Schnauzers with leukodystrophy,2019-10-04,"We report a hereditary leukodystrophy in Standard Schnauzer puppies. Clinical signs occurred shortly after birth or started at an age of under 4 weeks and included apathy, dysphoric vocalization, hypermetric ataxia, intension tremor, head tilt, circling, proprioceptive deficits, seizures and ventral strabismus consistent with a diffuse intracranial lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a diffuse white matter disease without mass effect. Macroscopically, the cerebral white matter showed a gelatinous texture in the centrum semiovale. A mild hydrocephalus internus was noted. Histopathologically, a severe multifocal reduction of myelin formation and moderate diffuse edema without inflammation was detected leading to the diagnosis of leukodystrophy. Combined linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping in two related families delineated critical intervals of approximately 29 Mb. The comparison of whole genome sequence data of one affected Standard Schnauzer to 221 control genomes revealed a single private homozygous protein changing variant in the critical intervals, TSEN54:c.371G>A or p.(Gly124Asp). TSEN54 encodes the tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit 54. In humans, several variants in TSEN54 were reported to cause different types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The genotypes at the c.371G>A variant were perfectly associated with the leukodystrophy phenotype in 12 affected Standard Schnauzers and almost 1000 control dogs from different breeds. These results suggest that TSEN54:c.371G>A causes the leukodystrophy. The identification of a candidate causative variant enables genetic testing so that the unintentional breeding of affected Standard Schnauzers can be avoided in the future. Our findings extend the known genotype-phenotype correlation for TSEN54 variants.","Störk, Theresa; Nessler, Jasmin; Anderegg, Linda; Hünerfauth, Enrice; Schmutz, Isabelle; Jagannathan, Vidhya; Kyöstilä, Kaisa; Lohi, Hannes; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang; Tipold, Andrea; Leeb, Tosso",PLoS Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6795476/,15

This study aimed to establish the reference values for selected hematology and serum clinical chemistry analyses that may contribute to research on shrew in future. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples (n=51) were collected from shrews between July and December 2015, Bangladesh, to estimate the levels of hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), total leukocyte count (TLC), total erythrocyte count (TEC), lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil, calcium, phosphorus (P), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), urea, glucose, total protein (TP), creatinine, and alanine transaminase (ALT). RESULTS: Although the values did not differ significantly among sexes, age was found to be a significant factor. Hb, PCV, TEC, glucose, and P were higher in males; eosinophil, Na, Cl, TP, and ALT were higher among females. Adults had significantly greater urea and glucose (p<0.05) while juveniles had insignificantly higher values for TLC, PCV, neutrophil, P, and TP. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first reference values for this species in Bangladesh and can be used to guide wildlife research studies.","Rahman, Md.

4199,Biological Activities of Secretory RNases: Focus on Their Oligomerization to Design Antitumor Drugs,2019-11-26,"Ribonucleases (RNases) are a large number of enzymes gathered into different bacterial or eukaryotic superfamilies. Bovine pancreatic RNase A, bovine seminal BS-RNase, human pancreatic RNase 1, angiogenin (RNase 5), and amphibian onconase belong to the pancreatic type superfamily, while binase and barnase are in the bacterial RNase N1/T1 family. In physiological conditions, most RNases secreted in the extracellular space counteract the undesired effects of extracellular RNAs and become protective against infections. Instead, if they enter the cell, RNases can digest intracellular RNAs, becoming cytotoxic and having advantageous effects against malignant cells. Their biological activities have been investigated either in vitro, toward a number of different cancer cell lines, or in some cases in vivo to test their potential therapeutic use. However, immunogenicity or other undesired effects have sometimes been associated with their action. Nevertheless, the use of RNases in therapy remains an appealing strategy against some still incurable tumors, such as mesothelioma, melanoma, or pancreatic cancer. The RNase inhibitor (RI) present inside almost all cells is the most efficacious sentry to counteract the ribonucleolytic action against intracellular RNAs because it forms a tight, irreversible and enzymatically inactive complex with many monomeric RNases. Therefore, dimerization or multimerization could represent a useful strategy for RNases to exert a remarkable cytotoxic activity by evading the interaction with RI by steric hindrance. Indeed, the majority of the mentioned RNases can hetero-dimerize with antibody derivatives, or even homo-dimerize or multimerize, spontaneously or artificially. This can occur through weak interactions or upon introducing covalent bonds. Immuno-RNases, in particular, are fusion proteins representing promising drugs by combining high target specificity with easy delivery in tumors. The results concerning the biological features of many RNases reported in the literature are described and discussed in this review. Furthermore, the activities displayed by some RNases forming oligomeric complexes, the mechanisms driving toward these supramolecular structures, and the biological rebounds connected are analyzed. These aspects are offered with the perspective to suggest possible efficacious therapeutic applications for RNases oligomeric derivatives that could contemporarily lack, or strongly reduce, immunogenicity and other undesired side-effects.","Gotte, Giovanni; Menegazzi, Marta",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6901985/,15

METHODS: We investigated the seroprevalence of three tissue-cyst-forming apicomplexan parasites (Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum and Besnoitia besnoiti) in 506 individuals of 12 wildlife species in Namibia using in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (indirect ELISAs applying purified antigens) for screening and immunoblots as confirmatory tests. We included six species of the suborder Feliformia, four species of the suborder Caniformia and two species of the suborder Ruminantia. For the two species for which we had most samples and life-history information, i.e. cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus, n = 250) and leopards (Panthera pardus, n = 58), we investigated T. gondii seroprevalence in relation to age class, sex, sociality (solitary, mother-offspring group, independent sibling group, coalition group) and site (natural habitat vs farmland). RESULTS: All but one carnivore species (bat-eared fox Otocyon megalotis, n = 4) were seropositive to T. gondii, with a seroprevalence ranging from 52.4% (131/250) in cheetahs to 93.2% (55/59) in African lions (Panthera leo). We also detected antibodies to T. gondii in 10.0% (2/20) of blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). Adult cheetahs and leopards were more likely to be seropositive to T. gondii than subadult conspecifics, whereas seroprevalence did not vary with sex, sociality and site. Furthermore, we measured antibodies to N. caninum in 15.4% (2/13) of brown hyenas (Hyaena brunnea) and 2.6% (1/39) of black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas). Antibodies to B. besnoiti were detected in 3.4% (2/59) of African lions and 20.0% (4/20) of blue wildebeest. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that Namibian wildlife species were exposed to apicomplexan parasites at different prevalences, depending on parasite and host species. In addition to serological work, molecular work is also needed to better understand the sylvatic cycle and the clear role of wildlife in the epidemiology of these parasites in southern Africa.","Seltmann, Anne; Schares, Gereon; Aschenborn, Ortwin H.

4319,Investigating a Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte invasion phenotype switch at the whole transcriptome level,2020-01-14,"The central role that erythrocyte invasion plays in Plasmodium falciparum survival and reproduction makes this process an attractive target for therapeutic or vaccine development. However, multiple invasion-related genes with complementary and overlapping functions afford the parasite the plasticity to vary ligands used for invasion, leading to phenotypic variation and immune evasion. Overcoming the challenge posed by redundant ligands requires a deeper understanding of conditions that select for variant phenotypes and the molecular mediators. While host factors including receptor heterogeneity and acquired immune responses may drive parasite phenotypic variation, we have previously shown that host-independent changes in invasion phenotype can be achieved by continuous culturing of the W2mef and Dd2 P. falciparum strains in moving suspension as opposed to static conditions. Here, we have used a highly biologically replicated whole transcriptome sequencing approach to identify the molecular signatures of variation associated with the phenotype switch. The data show increased expression of particular invasion-related genes in switched parasites, as well as a large number of genes encoding proteins that are either exported or form part of the export machinery. The genes with most markedly increased expression included members of the erythrocyte binding antigens (EBA), reticulocyte binding homologues (RH), surface associated interspersed proteins (SURFIN), exported protein family 1 (EPF1) and Plasmodium Helical Interspersed Sub-Telomeric (PHIST) gene families. The data indicate changes in expression of a repertoire of genes not previously associated with erythrocyte invasion phenotypes, suggesting the possibility that moving suspension culture may also select for other traits.","Nyarko, Prince B.; Tarr, Sarah J.; Aniweh, Yaw; Stewart, Lindsay B.; Conway, David J.; Awandare, Gordon A.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6959351/,15

This review provides an overview of the current state and the main results of clinical trials for sporozoite-targeting vaccines (i.e. the parasite stage infecting the liver) carried out by research groups in areas having variable malaria transmission rates. However, none has led to promising results regarding the effective control of the disease, thereby making it necessary to complement such efforts at finding/introducing new vaccine candidates by adopting a multi-epitope, multi-stage approach, based on minimal subunits of the main sporozoite proteins involved in the invasion of the liver.","Molina-Franky, Jessica; Cuy-Chaparro, Laura; Camargo, Anny; Reyes, César; Gómez, Marcela; Salamanca, David Ricardo; Patarroyo, Manuel Alfonso; Patarroyo, Manuel Elkin",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6998842/,15

Potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) represent a potential alternative or adjuvant to ART. In addition to suppressing viremia, bNAbs may have T cell immunomodulatory effects as seen for other forms of immunotherapy(3). However, this has not been established in individuals who are infected with HIV-1. Here, we document increased HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in the peripheral blood of all nine study participants who were infected with HIV-1 with suppressed blood viremia, while receiving bNAb therapy during ART interruption(4). Increased CD4(+) T cell responses were detected in eight individuals. The increased T cell responses were due both to newly detectable reactivity to HIV-1 Gag epitopes and the expansion of pre-existing measurable responses.

We previously reported the amino-terminal eight residues of the HIV-1-fusion peptide (FP8) – when conjugated to the carrier protein, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) – to be capable of inducing broadly neutralizing responses against HIV-1 in animal models. However, KLH is a multi-subunit particle derived from a natural source, and its manufacture as a clinical product remains a challenge. Here we report the preclinical development of recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (rTTHC) linked to FP8 (FP8-rTTHC) as a suitable FP-conjugate vaccine immunogen. We assessed 16 conjugates, made by coupling the 4 most prevalent FP8 sequences with 4 carrier proteins: the aforementioned KLH and rTTHC; the H. influenzae protein D (HiD); and the cross-reactive material from diphtheria toxin (CRM197). While each of the 16 FP8-carrier conjugates could elicit HIV-1-neutralizing responses, rTTHC conjugates induced higher FP-directed responses overall. A Sulfo-SIAB linker yielded superior results over an SM(PEG)2 linker but combinations of carriers, conjugation ratio of peptide to carrier, or choice of adjuvant (Adjuplex or Alum) did not significantly impact elicited FP-directed neutralizing responses in mice.

4629,A comprehensive and comparative phenotypic analysis of the collaborative founder strains identifies new and known phenotypes,2020-02-14,"BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requires urgent and specific antimicrobial therapy. However, the causal pathogen is typically unknown at the point when anti-infective therapeutics must be initiated. Physicians synthesize information from diverse data streams to make appropriate decisions. Artificial intelligence (AI) excels at finding complex relationships in large volumes of data. We aimed to evaluate the abilities of experienced physicians and AI to answer this question at patient admission: is it a viral or a bacterial pneumonia? METHODS: We included patients hospitalized for CAP and recorded all data available in the first 3-h period of care (clinical, biological and radiological information). For this proof-of-concept investigation, we decided to study only CAP caused by a singular and identified pathogen. We built a machine learning model prediction using all collected data. Finally, an independent validation set of samples was used to test the pathogen prediction performance of: (i) a panel of three experts and (ii) the AI algorithm. Both were blinded regarding the final microbial diagnosis. Positive likelihood ratio (LR) values > 10 and negative LR values < 0.1 were considered clinically relevant. RESULTS: We included 153 patients with CAP (70.6% men; 62 [51–73] years old; mean SAPSII, 37 [27–47]), 37% had viral pneumonia, 24% had bacterial pneumonia, 20% had a co-infection and 19% had no identified respiratory pathogen. We performed the analysis on 93 patients as co-pathogen and no-pathogen cases were excluded. The discriminant abilities of the AI approach were low to moderate (LR+ = 2.12 for viral and 6.29 for bacterial pneumonia), and the discriminant abilities of the experts were very low to low (LR+ = 3.81 for viral and 1.89 for bacterial pneumonia).

These viruses must co-opt nuclear processes for the benefit of the virus, whilst evading host processes that would otherwise attenuate viral replication. Accordingly, DNA viruses induce the formation of membraneless assemblies termed viral replication compartments (VRCs). These compartments facilitate the spatial organization of viral processes and regulate virus–host interactions. Here, we review advances in our understanding of VRCs. We cover their initiation and formation, their function as the sites of viral processes, and aspects of their composition and organization.

Sequences in coding and noncoding regions of barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) RNAs 1, 2, and 3 were compared with those of the monopartite RNA genomes of potato virus X (PVX), white clover mosaic virus (WClMV), and tobacco mosaic virus, the bipartite genome of tobacco rattle virus (TRV), the quadripartite genome of beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV), and icosahedral tricornaviruses. These plant viruses belong to a supergroup having 5′-capped genomic RNAs. The results suggest that the genomic elements in each BSMV RNA are phylogenetically related to those of different plant RNA viruses. RNA 1 resembles the corresponding RNA 1 of tricornaviruses. The putative proteins encoded in BSMV RNA 2 are related to the products of BNYVV RNA 2, PVX RNA, and WClMV RNA. Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that BSMV RNA 3 resembles TRV RNA 1. Also, it can be proposed that in the case of monopartite genomes, as a rule, every gene or block of genes retains phylogenetic relationships that are independent of adjacent genomic elements of the same RNA.

This group assignment incorporates all 36 of the public health core competencies while providing students with a real-world public health experience, and should be considered for inclusion within MPH programs across Canada. Business planning provides students the opportunity to engage in practice-based learning, applying theoretical knowledge to practice. Further, the ability to develop realistic but financially feasible public health problems is an invaluable skill for MPH graduates. As the development of programs becomes more restricted and the continuation of other programs are under constant threat, the ability to develop a sound business plan is a required skill for individuals entering the public health sector, and will ensure students are able to maximize outcomes given tight fiscal budgets and limited resources.","Papadopoulos, Andrew; Britten, Nicole; Hatcher, Meghan; Rainville, Keira",J Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087658/,15

These cells express several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognizing highly conserved microbial motifs and initiating the production of chemokines and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines acting as transmembrane or intracellular receptors. This might not only lead to acute but also to chronic inflammation which is discussed as an underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of different lung diseases.","Rohmann, Kristina; Tschernig, Thomas; Pabst, Reinhard; Goldmann, Thorsten; Drömann, Daniel",Cell Tissue Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087881/,15

Such threats represent opportunities to examine hypotheses about health anxiety. The present study investigated psychological predictors of Zika-related anxiety during the 2015–2016 outbreak. U.S. adults (N = 216) completed a battery of measures assessing Zika-related anxiety as well as psychological variables hypothesized to predict anxious responding to the threat of a domestic Zika outbreak. Contrary to hypotheses, regression analyses indicated that only contamination severity overestimates and greater Zika knowledge significantly predicted Zika-related anxiety.

The results of the existing algorithms in identifying the residue’s conservation strongly depend on the sequence alignment, making the results highly variable. Here, by introducing the amino acid similarity matrix, we propose a novel gap-treating approach by combining the evolutionary information and von Neumann entropies to compute the residue conservation scores. It is indicated through a series of tested results that the new approach is quite encouraging and promising and may become a useful tool in complementing the existing methods.","Zhang, S.-W.; Zhang, Y.-L.; Pan, Q.; Cheng, Y.-M.; Chou, K.-C.",Amino Acids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088136/,15
5262,Recent developments in therapeutic protein expression technologies in plants,2014-10-18,"Two previously identified forms of macrophage were investigated in primary cultures of cerebral cortical cells. Dynamic features were revealed through time-lapse video recording and aspects of macrophage function were assessed. The two cell forms were shown to be different pre-mitotic stages of a single cell type. The cell cycle for these cells involved an initial large, flat, quiescent cell which retracted to yield a slightly rounded form with numerous processes. This latter form lost processes and developed profuse filopodia as it became very rounded just prior to division; both resulting daughter cells then regained the initial large flat appearance. These cells possessed several properties of macrophages, including phagocytosis, nucleoside diphosphatase enzyme, and CR3 receptors. These properties were transient, expressed just before and after mitosis, but subsequently down-regulated in the flat daughter cells. Because of this feature, it was difficult to determine the exact size of this cell population; however, the observed rate of proliferation suggests it may be substantial. It is suggested that these cells correspond to non-microglial macrophages of brain tissue and, because of their significant down-regulation, they may be difficult to detect. This may be important in studies of brain accessory immune cells in tissue culture.","Booth, Paul L.; Eric Thomas, W.",Cell Tissue Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088352/,15
5318,Expression of anti-tumor recombinant IgG- and IgE-like genes in eukaryotic cells,2008-08-22,"A logistic model was employed to correlate the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) with related environmental factors and the migration of birds. Based on MODIS data of the normalized difference vegetation index, environmental factors were considered in generating a probability map with the aid of logistic regression. A Bayesian maximum entropy model was employed to explore the spatial and temporal correlations of HPAI incidence. The results show that proximity to water bodies and national highways was statistically relevant to the occurrence of HPAI. Migratory birds, mainly waterfowl, were important infection sources in HPAI transmission. In addition, the HPAI outbreaks had high spatiotemporal autocorrelation. This epidemic spatial range fluctuated 45 km owing to different distribution patterns of cities and water bodies. Furthermore, two outbreaks were likely to occur with a period of 22 d. The potential risk of occurrence of HPAI in Mainland China for the period from January 23 to February 17, 2004 was simulated based on these findings, providing a useful meta-model framework for the application of environmental factors in the prediction of HPAI risk.","Cao, ChunXiang; Xu, Min; Chang, ChaoYi; Xue, Yong; Zhong, ShaoBo; Fang, LiQun; Cao, WuChun; Zhang, Hao; Gao, MengXu; He, QiSheng; Zhao, Jian; Chen, Wei; Zheng, Sheng; Li, XiaoWen",Chin Sci Bull,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088651/,15

Novel genomic and proteomic technologies have provided opportunities for the discovery and improvement of DNA vaccines which are relatively easy as well as cheap to fabricate and stable at room temperatures. However, their main limitation is rather poor immunogenicity, which makes it necessary to couple the antigens with adjuvant molecules. This paper review recent advances in the development of DNA vaccines to some pathogenic protozoa and helminths. Numerous studies were conducted over the past 14 years of 21(st) century, employing various administration techniques, adjuvants and new immunogenic antigens to increase efficacy of DNA vaccines. Unfortunately, the results have not been rewarding. Further research is necessary using more extensive combinations of antigens; alternate delivery systems and more efficient adjuvants based on knowledge of the immunomodulatory capacities of parasitic protozoa and helminths.","Wedrychowicz, Halina",Acta Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088677/,15

Initial uptake rates were significantly greater in mouse than in rat astrocytes. Exposure of cultures to 0.25 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP for 2 weeks changed cell morphology from polygonal to stellate and stimulated ascorbate uptake, with the greatest stimulation occurring in mouse astrocytes. Uptake was specific for the vitamin since it was not diminished by the presence of other organic anions including acetate, formate, lactate, malonate, oxalate, p-aminohippurate, pyruvate and succinate. Ascorbate uptake was Na(+)-dependent but did not have a specific requirement for external Cl(−) (Cl(−) (0)). Substitution of Cl(−) (0) by Br(−) or NO(3) (−) decreased ascorbate uptake rates by 20–31%; whereas substitution by gluconate or isethionate increased uptake by 20–31%. Ascorbate transport by astroglial cultures from both animal species was rapidly (≤1 min) and reversibly inhibited by the anion transport inhibitors furosemide, 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (SITS) and 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS). The rapid and reversible effects of the impermeant inhibitors (SITS and DIDS) are consistent with direct inhibition of ascorbate transporters located in the astroglial plasma membrane.","Wilson, John X.; Jeffrey Dixon, S.",Neurochem Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089207/,15

The clinical dermatological findings (polycyclic configuration, easily bleeding ulcers) are thus especially important in patients under intensive care conditions. As examples, the cases of 3 critically ill patients (subarachnoid bleeding or head injury) developing therapy-resistant, flat sacral or perioral skin ulcers with peripheral blisters are presented. Herpes simplex virus was confirmed immunohistologically and in the smear test. All patients subsequently died. These cases emphasize that patients in the intensive care unit are in danger of developing a chronic persistent Herpes simplex infection due to latent immunosuppression.

RNA virus proteinases mediate their liberation from giant multidomain precursors in which they tend to occupy conserved positions. These proteinases possess a narrow substrate specificity, can cleave in cis and in trans, and may also have additional, nonproteolytic functions.

We were particularly interested in identifying cellular proteins that interact with fiber knob, which is the moiety within the Ad capsid responsible for high-affinity attachment of virus to cellular receptors. We used recombinant fiber knob domains from members of group C and B Ads to purify virus interacting proteins from cell membrane lysates and from human and mouse plasma. Using tandem mass spectrometry, we identified a number of candidate Ad-interacting proteins, including functional cellular receptors and previously unknown interacting partners such as complement component C4-binding protein and other blood proteins that presumably are involved in Ad infection after intravenous virus application. The ability of these proteins to bind to Ad was further confirmed using in vitro protein binding assays as well as infection competition assays. The approach of using a structural protein can be universally applied for a variety of viral and nonviral pathogens and can reveal host cell factors critical in viral infection, immune evasion, and tissue specificity.

Colostrum supplements (CS) have been developed to provide supplemental immunoglobulin when maternal colostrum is of poor quality. However, colostrum replacers (CR) that provide ≥100 g of IgG have not been formulated. Our objective was to determine the absorption of IgG in newborn calves fed CS derived from bovine serum or CR derived from bovine immunoglobulin concentrate. The CS were prepared by collecting, processing, and spray drying bovine serum and blending with other ingredients to provide 45 to 50 g of IgG per dose. The CR were prepared by further processing bovine serum to increase IgG concentration to >50% IgG and blending with other ingredients to provide 100 to 122 g of IgG per dose. Holstein calves (n = 160) were fed 90 to 244 g of IgG from CS or CR in 1 or 2 feedings in two experiments. Blood was collected from each calf by jugular venipuncture at 0 and 24 h of age and plasma IgG was determined by turbidimetric immunoassay. Apparent efficiency of IgG absorption was calculated. Plasma IgG concentrations at 24 h of age were indicative of IgG intake and averaged 5.5 to 14.1 g/L in calves fed CS and CR. Mean apparent efficiency of IgG absorption in calves fed CS was 25 and 28% in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Mean apparent efficiency of IgG absorption in calves fed CR ranged from 19 to 32% and were affected by method of processing and number of times fed. Treatment of plasma with polyethylene glycol reduced the efficiency of IgG absorption in experiment 1. The addition of animal fat to CR had no effect on IgG absorption. A second feeding of CR increased plasma IgG, but efficiency of absorption was reduced. Mean body weights at 60 d of age were not affected by treatment and ranged from 64.3 to 78.2 kg. Plasma IgG concentration in calves fed ≥122 g of IgG from Ig concentrate approached (9.9 g/L) or exceeded 10 g/L, indicating successful transfer of passive immunity.

Modules are link‐dense regions of the network where species interact more closely within the module than between modules of the network. Insufficient network resolution has meant that modules have proved difficult to identify, even though they appear important in the propagation of disturbance impacts. We applied a standardized approach across 20 farms to obtain well‐resolved food webs to characterize network structure and explore how modularity changes in response to management (organic and conventional). All networks showed significantly higher modularity than random networks. Farm management had no effect on the number of modules per farm or module richness, but there was a significant loss of links between modules on conventional farms, which may affect the long‐term stability of these networks. We found a significant association between modules and major habitat groups. If modules form as a result of interactions between species that utilize similar habitats, then ecosystem services to the crop components of the landscape, such as pest control by parasitoids originating in the non‐crop vegetation, are less likely to occur on these farms.","Macfadyen, Sarina; Gibson, Rachel H.; Symondson, William O.

Major concentrations of larvae occurred in the central portion of the lagoon, occasionally along the channels, but never at the inlets. The cycle of larva abundance was correlated with cycles of salinity and temperature. In spite of the greater number of species then, the spring and summer periods had low species diversity and evenness, due to the marked domination by larvae of Anchoa mitchilli. The number of larval fish species and individuals entering the lagoon from the adjacent offshore waters was minimal. The greatest portion of species diversity is generated within the lagoon itself. The community structure identified corresponds to the physically controlled type, as indicated by the poor diversity values obtained.","Flores‐Coto, César; Barba‐Torres, Francisco; Sánchez‐Robles, Jesús",Trans Am Fish Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169813/,15
10330,Antibodies against a short region of PfRipr inhibit Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion and PfRipr interaction with Rh5 and SEMA7A,2020-04-20,"Adenoviruses (AdVs) are DNA viruses that typically cause mild infections involving the upper or lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, or conjunctiva. Rare manifestations of AdV infections include hemorrhagic cystitis, hepatitis, hemorrhagic colitis, pancreatitis, nephritis, or meningoencephalitis. AdV infections are more common in young children, due to lack of humoral immunity. Epidemics of AdV infection may occur in healthy children or adults in closed or crowded settings (particularly military recruits). The disease is more severe and dissemination is more likely in patients with impaired immunity (e.g., organ transplant recipients, human immunodeficiency virus infection). Fatality rates for untreated severe AdV pneumonia or disseminated disease may exceed 50%. More than 50 serotypes of AdV have been identified. Different serotypes display different tissue tropisms that correlate with clinical manifestations of infection. The predominant serotypes circulating at a given time differ among countries or regions, and change over time. Transmission of novel strains between countries or across continents and replacement of dominant viruses by new strains may occur. Treatment of AdV infections is controversial, as prospective, randomized therapeutic trials have not been conducted. Cidofovir is the drug of choice for severe AdV infections, but not all patients require treatment. Live oral vaccines are highly efficacious in reducing the risk of respiratory AdV infection and are in routine use in the military in the United States, but currently are not available to civilians.","Lynch, Joseph P.; Kajon, Adriana E.",Semin Respir Crit Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171713/,15

In three pigs, a Swan-Ganz catheter was positioned in a pulmonary artery branch and hypertonic saline solution or a radiographic contrast agent were administered as boli through the distal or proximal openings of the catheter. During the administration through the proximal opening, the balloon at the tip of the catheter was either deflated or inflated. The latter case represented a perfusion defect. The series of EIT scans of the momentary distribution of electrical impedance within the chest were obtained during each saline bolus administration at a rate of 13/s. EBCT scans were acquired at a rate of 3.3/s during bolus administrations of the radiopaque contrast material under the same steady-state conditions. The EIT data were used to generate local time-impedance curves and functional EIT images showing the perfusion of a small lung region, both lungs with a perfusion defect and complete both lungs during bolus administration through the distal and proximal catheter opening with an inflated or deflated balloon, respectively. The results indicate that EIT imaging of lung perfusion is feasible when an electrical impedance contrast agent is used.","Frerichs, Inéz; Hinz, José; Herrmann, Peter; Weisser, Gerald; Hahn, Günter; Quintel, Michael; Hellige, Gerhard",IEEE Trans Med Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7186030/,15

Using a wide spectrum of large real-world networks, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional methods in a remarkable way. In particular, we find that the performance gains of our approach are particularly prominent for networks with high transitivity and assortativity, which verifies the vital role of structural holes in information diffusion on networked systems.","Li, Ping; Sun, Xian; Zhang, Kai; Zhang, Jie; Kurths, Jürgen",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217494/,15
11051,Novel vaccine technologies for the 21st century,2019-11-11,"Immunizing pregnant women to protect the mother, fetus and infant from infection has increasingly been used over the last decade. Protection against infectious diseases in neonates is mainly provided by maternal antibodies transferred from mother to infant during pregnancy through transplacental transport or after delivery via breastfeeding. Both the transplacental- and breast milk–derived maternal antibodies function as the primary source of protection against infectious diseases in neonates during the first vulnerable weeks of life. During recent infectious disease outbreaks (influenza, pertussis, Zika…) and for other infectious diseases (CMV, GBS…), pregnant women are increasingly identified as an important target for vaccination. For some of these diseases, vaccines are already on the market, and recommended during pregnancy. For others, vaccines are currently under development; furthermore, some are even specifically designed to be administered during pregnancy. Conclusion: This review article provides an overview on the rationale and main mechanism of the maternal vaccination strategy and gives a summary about the current and possible future recommendations for maternal vaccination.","Maertens, Kirsten; Orije, Marjolein Rozemarie Paulien; Van Damme, Pierre; Leuridan, Elke",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222942/,15

The present study was aimed at investigating the localization of DIM-1bm in the life-stages of B. malayi to identify the tissue target of vaccine action. METHODS: Recombinant DIM-1bm (rDIM-1bm) was prepared and antibodies were raised in BALB/c mice. Immunoblots of SDS-PAGE resolved B. malayi infective 3rd stage larvae (L(3)) and adult worm antigens and rDIM-1bm were prepared and reacted with anti-rDIM-1bm sera. Sections of adult female worms and whole-mount preparations of L(3) and microfilariae (mf) were stained by immunofluorescence using rDIM-1bm antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488 labeled secondary antibodies, and examined under a confocal microscope. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining showed that DIM-1bm is localized mainly in the subcuticular muscle layer in the L(3) and the adult worms; no fluorescent signal could be detected in mf. CONCLUSION: The localization of DIM-1bm in the parasites’ muscle layer suggests that the immunoprophylactic efficacy of DIM-1 is evidently due to immobilization of the parasite and its subsequent immune elimination.","Kushwaha, Vikas; Sahasrabuddhe, Amogh A.; Murthy, P.

RESULTS: We develop a deep learning-based method to predict tumor-specific vulnerabilities in patient samples by leveraging a wealth of in vitro screening data. Acquired dependencies of tumors are inferred in cases in which one allele is disrupted by inactivating mutations or in association with oncogenic mutations. Nucleocytoplasmic transport by Ran GTPase is identified as a common vulnerability in Her2-positive breast cancers. Vulnerability to loss of Ku70/80 is predicted for tumors that are defective in homologous recombination and rely on nonhomologous end joining for DNA repair. Our experimental validation for Ran, Ku70/80, and a proteasome subunit using patient-derived cells shows that they can be targeted specifically in particular tumors that are predicted to be dependent on them. CONCLUSION: This approach can be applied to facilitate the development of precision therapeutic targets for different tumors.","Jang, Kiwon; Park, Min Ji; Park, Jae Soon; Hwangbo, Haeun; Sung, Min Kyung; Kim, Sinae; Jung, Jaeyun; Lee, Jong Won; Ahn, Sei-Hyun; Chang, Suhwan; Choi, Jung Kyoon",Genome Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7386251/,15

Although rapid antigen detection tests for detecting these infections have been introduced recently, these are less sensitive than nucleic acid amplification tests. More recently, highly sensitive point-of-care testings (POCTs) have been developed based on nucleic acid amplification tests, which are easy to use in clinical settings. In this study, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based POCT “Simprova” to detect influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus was developed. Simprova system is fully automated and does not require skilled personnel. In addition, positive results can be achieved faster than with PCR. In this study, the accuracy of the POCT was retrospectively analyzed using 241 frozen stocked specimens. Additionally, the usability of the Simprova at clinical sites was assessed in a prospective clinical study using 380 clinical specimens and compared to those of real-time PCR and rapid antigen detection test. The novel LAMP-based POCT demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in characterizing clinical specimens from patients with influenza-like illnesses.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore perceptions and priorities of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) for physical activity and to incorporate their feedback to inform future development of a physical activity program delivered via a telemonitoring platform. SETTING: New York. METHODS: Qualitative data were collected from a purposive sample of adults with tetraplegia (N = 7). Two investigators led an audio-recorded focus group using a moderator’s guide. Data were analyzed using a six-phase thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: The discussion focused on two major areas, which resulted in multiple derived themes and subthemes. The first theme centered on the daily life of persons with tetraplegia, including changes after SCI, gain of function prioritization, and identification of psychosocial support systems that facilitate community reintegration after injury. The second theme centered on participant perceptions and recommendations for a physical activity program delivered via a telemonitoring platform. Desired design features included variations in schedule, diverse activities, or exercises included in each class, and optional two-way video to enable social interactions with classmates. CONCLUSIONS: Participants favorably viewed the concept of a physical activity program delivered via a telemonitoring platform and contributed program design ideas. Although this was a small sample size, challenges to obtaining physical activity expressed by participants were consistent with those identified previously in larger studies of persons with tetraplegia. Therefore, we expect these concepts and their recommendations to be relevant to the greater SCI community.","Pekmezaris, Renee; Kozikowski, Andrzej; Pascarelli, Briana; Handrakis, John P.; Chory, Ashley; Griffin, Doug; Bloom, Ona",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6786286/,15

Here, we compiled databases that comprise both computationally- or experimentally-derived data, and categorized them based on quiddity and origin of data, further focusing on those that present high throughput omic data or drug screens. These databases were then contextualized with genome-wide screening methods such as CRISPR/Cas9 and RNA interference, as well as state of art systems biology approaches that enable systematic characterizations of multi-omic data to find new indications for approved drugs or those that reached the latest phases of clinical trials. ABSTRACT: Modern drug discovery through de novo drug discovery entails high financial costs, low success rates, and lengthy trial periods. Drug repositioning presents a suitable approach for overcoming these issues by re-evaluating biological targets and modes of action of approved drugs. Coupling high-throughput technologies with genome-wide essentiality screens, network analysis, genome-scale metabolic modeling, and machine learning techniques enables the proposal of new drug–target signatures and uncovers unanticipated modes of action for available drugs. Here, we discuss the current issues associated with drug repositioning in light of curated high-throughput multi-omic databases, genome-wide screening technologies, and their application in systems biology/medicine approaches.","Mohammadi, Elyas; Benfeitas, Rui; Turkez, Hasan; Boren, Jan; Nielsen, Jens; Uhlen, Mathias; Mardinoglu, Adil",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7563533/,15

Therefore, the identification of new effective diagnostic and late prognostic biomarkers is of fundamental importance for the management of this tumor type. In our previous computational study, we have identified a set of microRNAs (miRNAs) significantly dysregulated in oral cancer and with a potential diagnostic and prognostic significance for oral cancer patients. Starting from our preliminary bioinformatics results, the aim of the present study was to validate the diagnostic potential of four selected miRNAs, hsa-miR-133a-3p, hsa-miR-375-3p, hsa-miR-503-5p and hsa-miR-196a-5p, in liquid biopsy samples obtained from oral cancer patients and healthy donors. For this purpose, the expression levels of the selected miRNAs were determined in plasma samples by using specific miRNA probes and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The ddPCR results showed that the hsa-miR-133a-3p and hsa-miR-375-3p were significantly down-regulated in oral cancer and their evaluation in liquid biopsy samples can predict the risk of oral cancer development with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, the computational analysis of miRNA expression and clinical-pathological features of patients allowed us to establish the functional role and prognostic significance of the two validated miRNAs. ABSTRACT: Despite the availability of screening programs, oral cancer deaths are increasing due to the lack of diagnostic biomarkers leading to late diagnosis and a poor prognosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover novel effective biomarkers for this tumor. On these bases, the aim of this study was to validate the diagnostic potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) through the analysis of liquid biopsy samples obtained from ten oral cancer patients and ten healthy controls. The expression of four selected miRNAs was evaluated by using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in a pilot cohort of ten oral cancer patients and ten healthy donors. Bioinformatics analyses were performed to assess the functional role of these miRNAs. The expression levels of the predicted down-regulated hsa-miR-133a-3p and hsa-miR-375-3p were significantly reduced in oral cancer patients compared to normal individuals while no significant results were obtained for the up-regulated hsa-miR-503-5p and hsa-miR-196a-5p. ROC analysis confirmed the high sensitivity and specificity of hsa-miR-375-3p and hsa-miR-133a-3p. Therefore, both miRNAs are significantly down-regulated in cancer patients and can be used as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of oral cancer. The analysis of circulating miRNAs in a larger series of patients is mandatory to confirm the results obtained in this pilot study.","Crimi, Salvatore; Falzone, Luca; Gattuso, Giuseppe; Grillo, Caterina Maria; Candido, Saverio; Bianchi, Alberto; Libra, Massimo",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7694750/,15

Delayed diagnosis, poor prognosis, and disease heterogeneity make its treatment ineffective. miRNAs are imposingly involved in personalized medicine such as therapeutics, due to their high sensitivity and accuracy. Our study aimed to reveal the biomarkers that may be involved in the dysregulated immune response in sepsis and lung injury using a computational approach and in vivo validation studies. A sepsis miRNA Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset based on the former analysis of blood samples was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and associated hub genes. Sepsis-associated genes from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) that overlapped with identified DEM targets were utilized for network construction. In total, 317 genes were found to be regulated by 10 DEMs (three upregulated, namely miR-4634, miR-4638-5p, and miR-4769-5p, and seven downregulated, namely miR-4299, miR-451a, miR181a-2-3p, miR-16-5p, miR-5704, miR-144-3p, and miR-1290). Overall hub genes (HIP1, GJC1, MDM4, IL6R, and ERC1) and for miR-16-5p (SYNRG, TNRC6B, and LAMTOR3) were identified based on centrality measures (degree, betweenness, and closeness). In vivo validation of miRNAs in lung tissue showed significantly downregulated expression of miR-16-5p corroborating with our computational findings, whereas expression of miR-181a-2-3p and miR-451a were found to be upregulated in contrast to the computational approach. In conclusion, the differential expression pattern of miRNAs and hub genes reported in this study may help to unravel many unexplored regulatory pathways, leading to the identification of critical molecular targets for increased prognosis, diagnosis, and drug efficacy in sepsis and associated organ injuries.","Ahmad, Shaniya; Ahmed, Mohd Murshad; Hasan, P.

This devastating occupational health hazard disproportionately affects rural farming communities in tropical countries. This is exacerbated by the distribution and densities of venomous snakes, incidence of encounters, and limited access to advanced healthcare, including antivenom. Before the development of antivenom, desperation and spiritual beliefs led patients to experiment with a wide range of traditional treatments. Many of these treatments still survive today, particularly in regions where access to healthcare is limited. Plants are a major source of bioactive molecules, including several lifesaving medications that are widely used to this day. However, much of the research into the use of traditional plant treatments for SBE are limited to preliminary analysis or have focused on techniques used to confirm antibody efficacy that are not suitable for non-antibody-containing treatments. Modern drugs are developed through a robust pharmaceutical drug discovery and development process, which applies as much to SBE as it does to any other disease. This review discusses specifically why research into ethnobotanical practices has failed to identify or develop a novel treatment for SBE and proposes specific approaches that should be considered in this area of research in the future.","Trim, Steven A.; Trim, Carol M.; Williams, Harry F.; Vaiyapuri, Sakthivel",Toxins (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762085/,15

There are few studies regarding the impact of the combined effect of multiple factors on special populations such as obese people. As obesity has become increasingly widespread in China, we studied the impact of commuting time on work stress on Chinese obese men (who exercise regularly vs. who exercise irregularly). We performed a secondary retrospective analysis of the cross-sectional data from the 2014 China Labor Force Dynamics Survey. We found that long commute times and less exercise have a positive effect on the increase in stress, but the effect is less evident for people who exercise regularly. Commuters traveling on foot are more stressed than those traveling by car. This study also found that commuting time had a significant impact on the perceived work stress of obese men who exercised irregularly. But the relationship between commuting time and work stress was different among groups with different commuting styles. For obese men who commuted on foot or motorcycle, commuting time had a significant impact on their job stress. However, for obese men who commuted by bicycle, bus, or car, commuting time had no significant effect on job stress. Additionally, active and passive commuting have different effects on stress. Active commuters tend to be more stressed, while passive commuters do not show a significant impact.","Zhu, Zhenjun; Chen, Hongsheng; Chen, Junlan; Ma, Jianxiao; He, Yudong",Am J Mens Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7739097/,15

However, estimating the risk of severe outcomes using clinical presentation or laboratory test results for rapid patient triage remains a challenge. Here, we aimed to develop prognostic models for severe dengue using machine learning, according to demographic information and clinical laboratory data of patients with dengue. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Out of 1,581 patients in the National Cheng Kung University Hospital with suspected dengue infections and subjected to NS1 antigen, IgM and IgG, and qRT-PCR tests, 798 patients including 138 severe cases were enrolled in the study. The primary target outcome was severe dengue. Machine learning models were trained and tested using the patient dataset that included demographic information and qualitative laboratory test results collected on day 1 when they sought medical advice. To develop prognostic models, we applied various machine learning methods, including logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting machine, support vector classifier, and artificial neural network, and compared the performance of the methods. The artificial neural network showed the highest average discrimination area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.8324 ± 0.0268) and balance accuracy (0.7523 ± 0.0273). According to the model explainer that analyzed the contributions/co-contributions of the different factors, patient age and dengue NS1 antigenemia were the two most important risk factors associated with severe dengue. Additionally, co-existence of anti-dengue IgM and IgG in patients with dengue increased the probability of severe dengue. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We developed prognostic models for the prediction of dengue severity in patients, using machine learning. The discriminative ability of the artificial neural network exhibited good performance for severe dengue prognosis. This model could help clinicians obtain a rapid prognosis during dengue outbreaks. However, the model requires further validation using external cohorts in future studies.","Huang, Sheng-Wen; Tsai, Huey-Pin; Hung, Su-Jhen; Ko, Wen-Chien; Wang, Jen-Ren",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7757819/,15
14729,The identification of novel immunogenic antigens as potential Shigella vaccine components,2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND: We have performed a head to head comparison of all-oral triplet combination of ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRD) versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (RD) in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) in the routine clinical practice. METHODS: A total of 344 patients treated with IRD (N = 127) or RD (N = 217) were selected for analysis from the Czech Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies (RMG). Descriptive statistics were used to assess patient’s characteristics associated with the respective therapy. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS), secondary end points included response rates and overall survival (OS). Survival endpoints were plotted using Kaplan-Meier methodology at 95% Greenwood confidence interval. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the effect of treatment regimens and the significance of uneven variables. Statistical tests were performed at significance level 0.05. RESULTS: In the whole cohort, median PFS for IRD was 17.5 and for RD was 11.5 months favoring the all-oral triplet, p = 0.005; in patients within relapse 1–3, the median PFS was 23.1 vs 11.6 months, p = 0.001. The hazard ratio for PFS was 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51–0.89, p = 0.006). The PFS advantage translated into improved OS for patients treated with IRD, median 36.6 months vs 26.0 months (p = 0.008). The overall response rate (ORR) was 73.0% in the IRD group vs 66.2% in the RD group with a complete response rate (CR) of 11.1% vs 8.8%, and very good partial response (VGPR) 22.2% vs 13.9%, IRD vs RD respectively. The IRD regimen was most beneficial in patients ≤75 years with ISS I, II, and in the first and second relapse. Patients with the presence of extramedullary disease did not benefit from IRD treatment (median PFS 6.5 months). Both regimens were well tolerated, and the incidence of total as well as grade 3/4 toxicities was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis confirms the results of the TOURMALINE-MM1 study and shows benefit of all-oral triplet IRD treatment versus RD doublet. It demonstrates that the addition of ixazomib to RD improves key survival endpoints in patients with RRMM in a routine clinical setting.","Minarik, Jiri; Pika, Tomas; Radocha, Jakub; Jungova, Alexandra; Straub, Jan; Jelinek, Tomas; Pour, Ludek; Pavlicek, Petr; Mistrik, Martin; Brozova, Lucie; Krhovska, Petra; Machalkova, Katerina; Jindra, Pavel; Spicka, Ivan; Plonkova, Hana; Stork, Martin; Bacovsky, Jaroslav; Capkova, Lenka; Sykora, Michal; Kessler, Petr; Stejskal, Lukas; Heindorfer, Adriana; Ullrychova, Jana; Skacel, Tomas; Maisnar, Vladimir; Hajek, Roman",BMC Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7810195/,15
14744,"The role of Zur-regulated lipoprotein A in bacterial morphology, antimicrobial susceptibility, and production of outer membrane vesicles in Acinetobacter baumannii",2021-01-18,"BACKGROUND: The avian haematophagous ectoparasite Dermanyssus gallinae, commonly known as the poultry red mite, causes significant economic losses to the egg-laying industry worldwide and also represents a significant welfare threat. Current acaricide-based controls are unsustainable due to the mite’s ability to rapidly develop resistance, thus developing a novel sustainable means of control for D. gallinae is a priority. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing is a valuable tool for studying gene function in non-model organisms, but is also emerging as a novel tool for parasite control. METHODS: Here we use an in silico approach to identify core RNAi pathway genes in the recently sequenced D. gallinae genome. In addition we utilise an in vitro feeding device to deliver double-stranded (ds) RNA to D. gallinae targeting the D. gallinae vATPase subunit A (Dg vATPase A) gene and monitor gene knockdown using quantitative PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: Core components of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) pathways were identified in D. gallinae, which indicates that these gene silencing pathways are likely functional. Strikingly, the P-element-induced wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway was absent in D. gallinae. In addition, feeding Dg vATPase A dsRNA to adult female D. gallinae resulted in silencing of the targeted gene compared to control mites fed non-specific lacZ dsRNA. In D. gallinae, dsRNA-mediated gene knockdown was rapid, being detectable 24 h after oral delivery of the dsRNA, and persisted for at least 120 h. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the presence of core RNAi machinery components in the D. gallinae genome. In addition, we have developed a robust RNAi methodology for targeting genes in D. gallinae that will be of value for studying genes of unknown function and validating potential control targets in D. gallinae.

14869,Detection of CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Mutations Using a Carbon Nanotube-Modified Electrochemical Genosensor,2021-01-08,"In recent years, awareness about the risk of particulate matter (PM) has increased both domestically and internationally; consequently, various policies have been implemented to reduce PM. Since citizens are both victim and cause of this risk, PM cannot be successfully decreased only through government policies. Therefore, citizens’ active participation is required to reduce PM and prevent its risks. However, a theoretical model about public behavior against PM has not been established. Therefore, we suggest the public behavior model about individuals’ response against PM, in which response actions are classified into four types based on the combinations of the public-personal domains and mitigation-adaptation actions: Personal or public adaptations, and personal or public mitigations. We analyze how risk perception, risk communication, blame attribution factors influence the four types of responses against PM. The analysis results reveal that the receiver’s ability, negative emotion, trust in government, and age influence personal mitigation behavior, personal adaptation, public mitigation, and public adaptation, respectively. As this study demonstrates the differences in the factors influencing each type of response actions against PM, evidence-based policy is needed that considers the differences in these influencing factors.","Kim, Geunsik; Kim, Seoyong; Hwang, Eunjung",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7827748/,15
15232,An Overview of the Potential Therapeutic Applications of Essential Oils,2021-01-26,"In this study, we investigated the bioactive potential (antibacterial and antioxidant), anticancer activity and detailed phytochemical analysis of Selaginella repanda (S. repanda) ethanolic crude extract for the very first time using different in vitro approaches. Furthermore, computer-aided prediction of pharmacokinetic properties and safety profile of the identified phytoconstituents were also employed in order to provide some useful insights for drug discovery. S. repanda, which is a rich source of potent natural bioactive compounds, showed promising antibacterial activity against the tested pathogenic bacteria (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. flexneri). The crude extract displayed favorable antioxidant activity against both 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (IC(50) = 231.6 μg/mL) and H(2)O(2) (IC(50) = 288.3 μg/mL) molecules. S. repanda also showed favorable and effective anticancer activity against all three malignant cancer cells in a dose/time dependent manner. Higher activity was found against lung (A549) (IC(50) = 341.1 μg/mL), followed by colon (HCT-116) (IC(50) = 378.8 μg/mL) and breast (MCF-7) (IC(50) = 428.3 μg/mL) cancer cells. High resolution-liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HR-LC–MS) data of S. repanda crude extract revealed the presence of diverse bioactive/chemical components, including fatty acids, alcohol, sugar, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, coumarins and phenolics, which can be the basis and major cause for its bioactive potential. Therefore, achieved results from this study confirmed the efficacy of S. repanda and a prospective source of naturally active biomolecules with antibacterial, antioxidant and anticancer potential. These phytocompounds alone with their favorable pharmacokinetics profile suggests good lead and efficiency of S. repanda with no toxicity risks. Finally, further in vivo experimental investigations can be promoted as probable candidates for various therapeutic functions, drug discovery and development.","Adnan, Mohd; Siddiqui, Arif Jamal; Hamadou, Walid Sabri; Patel, Mitesh; Ashraf, Syed Amir; Jamal, Arshad; Awadelkareem, Amir Mahgoub; Sachidanandan, Manojkumar; Snoussi, Mejdi; De Feo, Vincenzo",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7867377/,15
15247,A new generation needle- and adjuvant-free trivalent plague vaccine utilizing adenovirus-5 nanoparticle platform,2021-01-29,"Despite the need for safe and effective postoperative analgesia in neonates, research regarding pain management in neonatal rodents is relatively limited. Here, we investigate whether sustained release buprenorphine (Bup SR) effectively attenuates thermal hypersensitivity in a neonatal rat model of incisional pain. Male and female postnatal day 3 Sprague Dawley rat pups (n = 34) were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: 1) saline (control), 0.1 mL, once subcutaneously (SC); 2) buprenorphine HCl (Bup HCl), 0.05 mg/kg, once SC; 3) low dose Bup SR (low-SR), 0.5 mg/kg, once SC; 4) high dose Bup SR (high-SR), 1 mg/kg, once SC. Pups were anesthetized with sevoflurane and a 0.5-cm long skin incision was made over the left lateral thigh. The underlying muscle was dissected and closed using surgical glue. Thermal hypersensitivity testing was performed at 24 h prior to surgery and subsequently at 1, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h post-surgery using an infrared diode laser. Thermal hypersensitivity was attenuated at 1 h post-surgery in the Bup HCl group, while it was attenuated through the entire postoperative period in both low-SR and high-SR groups. This data suggests that a single dose of low-SR (0.5 mg/kg) or high-SR (1 mg/kg) effectively attenuates thermal hypersensitivity for at least 8 h in neonatal rat pups.","Blaney, Alexandra; Jampachaisri, Katechan; Huss, Monika K.; Pacharinsak, Cholawat",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7857552/,15
15278,High-resolution mapping of the neutralizing and binding specificities of polyclonal sera post-HIV Env trimer vaccination,2021-01-13,"OBJECTIVES: Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite, could affect numerous warm-blooded animals, such as humans. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are essential Ca(2+) signaling mediators and participate in parasite host cell egress, outer membrane motility, invasion, and cell division. RESULTS: Several bioinformatics online servers were employed to analyze and predict the important properties of CDPK4 protein. The findings revealed that CDPK4 peptide has 1158 amino acid residues with average molecular weight (MW) of 126.331 KDa. The aliphatic index and GRAVY for this protein were estimated at 66.82 and – 0.650, respectively. The findings revealed that the CDPK4 protein comprised 30.14% and 34.97% alpha-helix, 59.84% and 53.54% random coils, and 10.02% and 11.49% extended strand with SOPMA and GOR4 tools, respectively. Ramachandran plot output showed 87.87%, 8.40%, and 3.73% of amino acid residues in the favored, allowed, and outlier regions, respectively. Also, several potential B and T-cell epitopes were predicted for CDPK4 protein through different bioinformatics tools. Also, antigenicity and allergenicity evaluation demonstrated that this protein has immunogenic and non-allergenic nature. This paper presents a basis for further studies, thereby provides a fundamental basis for the development of an effective vaccine against T. gondii infection.","Foroutan, Masoud; Ghaffari, Ali Dalir; Soltani, Shahrzad; Majidiani, Hamidreza; Taghipour, Ali; Sabaghan, Mohamad",BMC Res Notes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7865105/,15
15322,High prevalence of antibiotic resistance in commensal Escherichia coli from healthy human sources in community settings,2021-02-09,"BACKGROUND: An unexpected dengue outbreak occurred in Hunan Province in 2018. This was the first dengue outbreak in this area of inland China, and 172 cases were reported. METHODS: To verify the causative agent of this outbreak and characterise the viral genes, the genes encoding the structural proteins C/prM/E of viruses isolated from local residents were sequenced followed by mutation and phylogenetic analysis. Recombination, selection pressure, potential secondary structure and three-dimensional structure analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all epidemic strains were of the cosmopolitan DENV-2 genotype and were most closely related to the Zhejiang strain (MH010629, 2017) and then the Malaysia strain (KJ806803, 2013). Compared with the sequence of DENV-2SS, 151 base substitutions were found in the sequences of 89 isolates; these substitutions resulted in 20 non-synonymous mutations, of which 17 mutations existed in all samples (two in the capsid protein, six in the prM/M proteins, and nine in the envelope proteins). Moreover, amino acid substitutions at the 602nd (E322:Q → H) and 670th (E390: N → S) amino acids may have enhanced the virulence of the epidemic strains. One new DNA binding site and five new protein binding sites were observed. Two polynucleotide binding sites and seven protein binding sites were lost in the epidemic strains compared with DENV-2SS. Meanwhile, five changes were found in helical regions. Minor changes were observed in helical transmembrane and disordered regions. The 429th amino acid of the E protein switched from a histamine (positively charged) to an asparagine (neutral) in all 89 isolated strains. No recombination events or positive selection pressure sites were observed. To our knowledge, this study is the first to analyse the genetic characteristics of epidemic strains in the first dengue outbreak in Hunan Province in inland China. CONCLUSIONS: The causative agent is likely to come from Zhejiang Province, a neighbouring province where dengue fever broke out in 2017. This study may help clarify the intrinsic geographical relatedness of DENV-2 and contribute to further research on pathogenicity and vaccine development.

When modeling complex sequences, attention mechanisms are regarded as the established approach to support deep neural networks with intrinsic interpretability. This paper focuses on the emerging trend of specifically designing diagnostic datasets for understanding the inner workings of attention mechanism based deep learning models for multivariate forecasting tasks. We design a novel benchmark of synthetically designed datasets with the transparent underlying generating process of multiple time series interactions with increasing complexity. The benchmark enables empirical evaluation of the performance of attention based deep neural networks in three different aspects: (i) prediction performance score, (ii) interpretability correctness, (iii) sensitivity analysis. Our analysis shows that although most models have satisfying and stable prediction performance results, they often fail to give correct interpretability. The only model with both a satisfying performance score and correct interpretability is IMV-LSTM, capturing both autocorrelations and crosscorrelations between multiple time series. Interestingly, while evaluating IMV-LSTM on simulated data from statistical and mechanistic models, the correctness of interpretability increases with more complex datasets.","Barić, Domjan; Fumić, Petar; Horvatić, Davor; Lipic, Tomislav",Entropy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912396/,15

A checklist was used in the simulation to evaluate practical skills of basic CPR. The learning outcomes showed statistically significant differences in the total score of the pre-test and after completing the BLS clinical simulation course (pre-test: 12.61 (2.30), post-test: 15.60 (2.06), p < 0.001). A significant increase in the mean scores was observed after completing the course in each of the four parts of the assessment protocol (p < 0.001). The increase in scores in the cardiac arrest and CPR sections were relevant (Rosenthal’s r: −0.72). The students who had prior knowledge of BLS scored higher on both the pre-test and the post-test.

Hence, increasing vaccination rates is an important policy goal within the EU and worldwide. We aim to evaluate individual and systemic parameters associated with vaccination in European Union citizens aged 55 or older, using data from the Special Eurobarometer 488. Methods: Linear probability and probit models are estimated to analyze the determinants of vaccination take-up. Further, descriptive analyses are used to explore how the reasons for not having a vaccination differ by welfare regime. Results: High knowledge about the effectiveness and safety of vaccination increases the probability of receiving a vaccination during the past five years by 26 percentage points (pp), medium knowledge increases it by 15 pp. Focusing on the specific case of the flu, official recommendations increase this probability by, on average, 6 pp; while having to pay out-of-pocket for a recommended vaccination decreases it by, on average, 10 pp. Furthermore, the differences for no vaccination differ widely across welfare systems and television is the primary source for information about vaccination. Conclusions: Reported vaccination rates in Europe fall far below targets set by official recommendations. Increasing vaccination knowledge and offering vaccinations free of charge can help to increase vaccination rates. A specific focus should be put on reaching individuals with potential difficulties of access such as those living alone and unemployed.","Anastasiou, Olympia E.; Heger, Dörte",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7922776/,15

METHODS: BCR repertoire sequencing and whole-exome sequencing were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from 12 DLBCL patients. Subsequently, a typing model was built with cluster analysis, and prognostic indicators between the two groups were compared to verify the typing model. Then, mutation and bioinformatics analyses were conducted to investigate the potential biomarkers of prognostic differences between the two groups. RESULTS: Based on BCR sequencing data, we divided patients into two clusters (cluster 1 and cluster 2); this classification differed from the traditional typing method (GCB and non-GCB), in which cluster 1 included some non-GCB patients. The progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), metastasis and Shannon diversity index of IGH V-J and survival after chemotherapy were significantly different (P < 0.05) between the two clusters, but no statistical significance was found between the GCB and non-GCB groups. The mutation status of 248 genes was significantly different between cluster 1 and cluster 2. Among them, FTSJ3, MAGED2, and ODF3L2 were the specific mutated genes in all patients in cluster 2, and these genes could be considered critical to the different prognoses of the two clusters of DLBCL patients. CONCLUSION: We constructed a new typing model of DLBCL based on BCR repertoire sequencing that can better predict the survival time after chemotherapy.

Most intracellular polyamines are associated with RNA and, subsequently, polyamines have significant effects on transcription and translation. Putrescine and spermidine are the most common polyamines in bacteria. Intracellular polyamine pools in bacteria are tightly controlled by both de novo synthesis and transport. Polyamine homeostasis is emerging as a critical parameter of multiple pathways and physiology with substantial impact on bacterial pathogenesis, including the important human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. Modulation of polyamine metabolism in pneumococci is an important regulator of central metabolism. It has broad effects on virulence factors such as capsule as well as stress responses that ultimately impact the survival of pneumococcus in a host. Polyamine transport protein as a single antigen or in combination with other pneumococcal proteins is shown to be an efficacious immunogen that protects against nasopharyngeal colonization, and invasive disease. A comprehensive description of polyamine metabolic pathways and their intersection with pneumococcal pathogenesis will undoubtedly point to novel approaches for treatment and prevention of pneumococcal disease.","Nanduri, Bindu; Swiatlo, Edwin",Pneumonia (Nathan),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990898/,15

Elevated arterial CO(2) (hypercapnia) is encountered in a range of clinical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and as a consequence of therapeutic ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome. In patients suffering from this syndrome, therapeutic hypoventilation strategy designed to reduce mechanical damage to the lungs is accompanied by systemic hypercapnia and associated acidosis, which are associated with improved patient outcome. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of hypercapnia and the relative contribution of elevated CO(2) or associated acidosis to this response remain poorly understood. Recently, a role for the non-canonical NF-κB pathway has been postulated to be important in signaling the cellular transcriptional response to CO(2). In this study, we demonstrate that in cells exposed to elevated CO(2), the NF-κB family member RelB was cleaved to a lower molecular weight form and translocated to the nucleus in both mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human pulmonary epithelial cells (A549). Furthermore, elevated nuclear RelB was observed in vivo and correlated with hypercapnia-induced protection against LPS-induced lung injury. Hypercapnia-induced RelB processing was sensitive to proteasomal inhibition by MG-132 but was independent of the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β or MALT-1, both of which have been previously shown to mediate RelB processing. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RelB is a CO(2)-sensitive NF-κB family member that may contribute to the beneficial effects of hypercapnia in inflammatory diseases of the lung.","Oliver, Kathryn M.; Lenihan, Colin R.; Bruning, Ulrike; Cheong, Alex; Laffey, John G.; McLoughlin, Paul; Taylor, Cormac T.; Cummins, Eoin P.",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3340129/,15

Sanger sequencing and genotyping was performed and one representative complete genome was generated to facilitate genome-wide comparison to other available African HEV sequences by phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 420 samples were available from cattle (n = 105), goats (n = 124), pigs (n = 89) and sheep (n = 102). HEV Viral RNA was detected only in pig samples (10.1%). The antibody detection rate in pigs was 77.5%, with positive samples from all sampling sites. Average viral load was 1 × 10(5) (range 1.02 × 10(3) to 3.17 × 10(5)) International Units per mL of serum with no statistically significant differences between age groups (≤ 6 month, > 6 months) by a T-test comparison of means (t = 1.4272, df = 7, p = 0.1966). Sequences obtained in this study form a monophyletic group within HEV genotype 3. Sequences from Cameroon, Ghana, Burkina Faso and Madagascar were found to share a most recent common ancestor; however this was not the case for other African HEV sequences. CONCLUSION: HEV genotype 3 is highly endemic in pigs in Ghana and likely poses a zoonotic risk to people exposed to pigs. HEV genotype 3 in Ghana shares a common origin with other virus strains from Sub-Saharan Africa.","El-Duah, Philip; Dei, Dickson; Binger, Tabea; Sylverken, Augustina; Wollny, Robert; Tasiame, William; Oppong, Samuel; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Emikpe, Benjamin; Folitse, Raphael; Drexler, Jan Felix; Phillips, Richard; Drosten, Christian; Corman, Victor Max",One Health Outlook,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993477/,15
16652,"Ventajas, inconvenientes y aspectos éticos del teletrabajo",2021-04-07,"Background: In China, the incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is increasing every year, but the etiology of UC remains unclear. UC is known to increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of crocin against UC and CRC in mouse models. Methods: Crocin was used to treat the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC mice for 3 weeks, and Apc(MinC)/Gpt mice with colorectal cancer for 8 weeks. Proteomics screening was used to detect changes in the protein profiles of colon tissues of UC mice. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and western blot were used to verify these changes. Results: Crocin strongly reduced the disease activity index scores of UC mice, and improved the pathological symptoms of the colonic epithelium. The anti-inflammatory effects of crocin were indicated by its regulation of the activity of various cytokines, such as interleukins, via the modulation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling. Crocin significantly suppressed tumor growth in Apc(MinC)/Gpt mice and ameliorated pathological alterations in the colon and liver, but had no effects on spleen and kidney. Additionally, crocin significantly decreased the concentrations of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor-α in the sera and colon tissues, suggesting its anti-inflammatory effects related to NF-κB signaling. Finally, 12-h incubation of SW480 cells with crocin caused cell cycle arrest, enhanced the apoptotic rate, promoted the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the over-accumulation of reactive oxygen species. From the theoretical analyses, phosphorylated residues on S536 may enhance the protein-protein interactions which may influence the conformational changes in the secondary structure of NF-κB. Conclusion: The protective effects of crocin on UC and CRC were due to its suppression of NF-κB-mediated inflammation.","Teng, Shanshan; Hao, Jie; Bi, Hui; Li, Congcong; Zhang, Yongfeng; Zhang, Yaqin; Han, Weiwei; Wang, Di",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8025585/,15

17147,The role and application of small extracellular vesicles in gastric cancer,2021-04-29,"BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) bereaved by the death of a parent or sibling from cancer report unique psychosocial needs and can have difficulty adjusting to their loss. Unaddressed, this can result in poor long-term bereavement outcomes. This paper describes the development and evaluation of Good Grief – a 3-day camp-based program focused on meeting coping, social support, and respite needs of AYAs bereaved by familial cancer. METHODS: One hundred and nine Australian AYAs (68% female; age: 12–25 years, M = 16.63) participated in the evaluation. Grief intensity (Texas Revised Inventory of Grief), meaning-making (Grief and Meaning Reconstruction Inventory), trauma coping (Perceived Ability to Cope with Trauma Scale) and unmet needs (Bereaved Cancer Needs Instrument) measures were administered pre-program and 3-months post-program. Acceptability was measured after each session and at the program’s conclusion. Appropriateness was measured at 3-month follow-up. Thirteen participants were interviewed three months post-program on their perceptions of the program. RESULTS: Participants reported high program satisfaction, engagement with psychosocial sessions, and enjoyment of recreational activities. Significant improvements were observed in trauma coping abilities and reductions in unmet needs for managing emotions, social support, respite, future planning, and accessing information and support domains. No change was evident in grief intensity or meaning-making as measured quantitatively. Interviews supported these quantitative findings but also identified evidence of personal growth, a component of meaning-making. CONCLUSIONS: Good Grief is a highly acceptable and beneficial intervention that addresses the unique needs of AYAs bereaved by familial cancer.","Patterson, Pandora; McDonald, Fiona E.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between starting smoking with e-cigarettes or conventional cigarettes and suicidal behaviors among Korean adolescents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data on adolescents in grades 7 through 12 who participated in the nationwide Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey between 2015 and 2018. EXPOSURES: Type of cigarette initially smoked: electronic or conventional. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association between initial cigarette type and suicidal behaviors, including suicidal ideation and suicide planning and attempts. All participants completed questionnaires about their history of suicidal behavior and were categorized into groups according to the type of cigarette used at initiation of smoking and any subsequent change (or lack of change) in the type of cigarette used. RESULTS: A total of 255 887 Korean adolescents (51.2% male; mean (SD) age, 15.0 [1.8] years) were included in the primary analysis. Among 131 094 male adolescents, 3310 boys (2.5%) initially used e-cigarettes and 27 368 boys (20.9%) initially used conventional cigarettes. Among 124 793 female adolescents, 952 girls (0.8%) initially used e-cigarettes and 9296 girls (7.4%) initially used conventional cigarettes. Of those who initially used e-cigarettes, 178 of 3310 boys (5.4%) and 134 of 952 girls (14.1%) attempted suicide. Of those who initially used conventional cigarettes, 946 of 27 368 boys (3.5%) and 911 of 9296 girls (9.8%) attempted suicide. Adolescents who initially used e-cigarettes had a higher risk of suicidal behaviors, including suicide planning (boys: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.63 [95% CI, 1.40-1.89]; P < .001; girls: AOR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.23-1.95]; P < .001) and suicide attempts (boys: AOR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.28-1.87]; P < .001; girls, AOR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.29-2.10]; P < .001) compared with those who initially used conventional cigarettes. Changing from e-cigarettes to conventional cigarettes was associated with a higher risk of suicide attempts among both boys (AOR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.39-2.57; P < .001) and girls (AOR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.53-3.64; P < .001) compared with changing from conventional cigarettes to e-cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the initial use of e-cigarettes vs conventional cigarettes was associated with suicidal behaviors among adolescents. In future research on the association of e-cigarette use with adolescent mental health and interventions for suicide prevention, the type of cigarette initially used and changing the cigarette type should be considered.","Kim, Seung Hoon; Jeong, Sung Hoon; Park, Eun-Cheol; Jang, Sung-In",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8087956/,15
17270,Role of Virally Encoded Circular RNAs in the Pathogenicity of Human Oncogenic Viruses,2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND: Adequate financing is a crucial function, securing that physical rehabilitation services (i.e., physiotherapy, occupational therapy, prosthetics and orthotics) are available with no financial hardship. Like many other countries, despite the adoption of various policies and strategies in recent decades, Iran enjoys no desirable physical rehabilitation financing (PRF). Accordingly, this qualitative study aimed to explore the PRF-related strategies and issues as well as their impacts on relevant policies in Iran. METHODS: An analysis of PRF-related policies was conducted in Iran using semi-structured interviews and policy documents review. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were employed to select key informants, including health-policy makers, civil society, rehabilitation-policy makers, university professors, and practitioners. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the collected data. The analysis was framed within Kingdon’s multiple streams. RESULTS: The hindering factors for desirable financing were weak insurance coverage, lack of sustainable financial resources, fragmented financing, lack of split between provider and financer, high-cost of physical rehabilitation services, low engagement of relevant experts in policy-making processes, and corrupt activities. In the policy stream, the following factors were highlighted: involvement of sustainable financial resources, the use of external revenue sources, allocated resources’ earmarking, the integration of the current funds to have better pooling, the use of incentive and timely payment mechanisms, the implementation of strategic purchasing principals, and the employment of effective rationing strategies. Moreover, parliament support, changes in administrations, international effects, pressures from interest campaigns and NGOs, and international sanctions were found as factors affecting the politics stream. CONCLUSION: The study findings revealed that a variety of national and international factors affect PRF-related issues in Iran. The recently enacted laws indicate that the PRF policies have already been on the national health political agenda. The study reflected the multifaceted nature of barriers to optimal PRF in Iran.","Shahabi, Saeed; Mojgani, Parviz; Shabaninejad, Hosein; Teymourlouy, Ahmad Ahmadi; Behzadifar, Masoud; Lankarani, Kamran Bagheri",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8094566/,15
17368,ATHB2 is a negative regulator of germination in Arabidopsis thaliana seeds,2021-05-06,"BACKGROUND: West Nile (WNV) and Usutu (USUV) are emerging vector-borne zoonotic flaviviruses. They are antigenically very similar, sharing the same life cycle with birds as amplification host, Culicidae as vector, and man/horse as dead-end host. They can co-circulate in an overlapping geographic range. In Europe, surveillance plans annually detect several outbreaks. METHODS: In Italy, a WNV/USUV surveillance plan is in place through passive and active surveillance. After a 2018 WNV outbreak, a reinforced integrated risk-based surveillance was performed in four municipalities through clinical and serological surveillance in horses, Culicidae catches, and testing on human blood-based products for transfusion. RESULTS: Eight WNV cases in eight equine holdings were detected. Twenty-three mosquitoe catches were performed and 2367 specimens of Culex pipiens caught; 17 pools were USUV positive. A total of 8889 human blood donations were tested, and two asymptomatic donors were USUV positive. CONCLUSIONS: Different surveillance components simultaneously detected WNV only in horses and USUV only in humans and mosquitoes. While in endemic areas (i.e. northern Italy) entomological surveillance is successfully used as an early detection warning, this method in central Italy seems ineffective. To achieve a high level of sensitivity, the entomological trapping effort should probably exceed a reasonable balance between cost and performance. Besides, WNV/USUV early detection can be addressed by horses and birds. Further research is needed to adapt the surveillance components in different epidemiological contexts.

Multiple studies show that ASE plays a role in hereditary diseases by modulating penetrance or phenotype severity. However, genome diagnostics is based on DNA sequencing and therefore neglects gene expression regulation such as ASE. To take advantage of ASE in absence of RNA sequencing, it must be predicted using only DNA variation. We have constructed ASE models from BIOS (n = 3432) and GTEx (n = 369) that predict ASE using DNA features. These models are highly reproducible and comprise many different feature types, highlighting the complex regulation that underlies ASE. We applied the BIOS-trained model to population variants in three genes in which ASE plays a clinically relevant role: BRCA2, RET and NF1. This resulted in predicted ASE effects for 27 variants, of which 10 were known pathogenic variants. We demonstrated that ASE can be predicted from DNA features using machine learning. Future efforts may improve sensitivity and translate these models into a new type of genome diagnostic tool that prioritizes candidate pathogenic variants or regulators thereof for follow-up validation by RNA sequencing. All used code and machine learning models are available at GitHub and Zenodo.","Zhang, Zhenhua; van Dijk, Freerk; de Klein, Niek; van Gijn, Mariëlle E; Franke, Lude H; Sinke, Richard J; Swertz, Morris A; van der Velde, K Joeri",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8134421/,15

In this study, we assessed patterns of CRMU among Canadian adults with cancer. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study using survey data. We accessed data sets from the 2015/16 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) and reviewed the records of adults (≥ 18 yr) with a history of cancer who were prescribed medication in the previous 12 months. We collected information about sociodemographic features, health behaviours and CRMU, and conducted a multivariable logistic regression analysis for factors associated with CRMU. RESULTS: A total of 8581 participants were eligible for the current study. In the weighted multivariable logistic regression analysis, the following factors were associated with CRMU: younger age (odds ratio [OR] 2.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.79–3.63), female sex (male sex v. female sex OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44–0.88), Indigenous racial background (Indigenous v.

More than 30 subtypes have been identified, five dominant and 26 recessive. The increase in the characterization of new genotypes in the family of LGMDs further adds to the heterogeneity of the disease. Meanwhile, better understanding of the phenotype led to the reconsideration of the disease definition, which resulted in eight old subtypes to be no longer recognized officially as LGMD and five new diseases to be added to the LGMD family. The unique variabilities of LGMD stem from genetic mutations, which then lead to protein and ultimately muscle dysfunction. Herein, we review the LGMD pathway, starting with the genetic mutations that encode proteins involved in muscle maintenance and repair, and including the genotype–phenotype relationship of the disease, the epidemiology, disease progression, burden of illness, and emerging treatments.","Georganopoulou, Dimitra G.; Moisiadis, Vasilis G.; Malik, Firhan A.; Mohajer, Ali; Dashevsky, Tanya M.; Wuu, Shirley T.; Hu, Chih-Kao",Protein J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8190568/,15

Nevertheless, patients develop severe syndromes associated with autonomic nervous system disturbance (ANSD) and the requirement for mechanical ventilation (MV). Understanding factors associated with worse outcome in such settings is important to direct interventions. In this study, we investigate risk factors for disease severity and long-term physical outcome in adults with tetanus admitted to a Vietnamese intensive care unit. METHODS: Clinical and demographic variables were collected prospectively from 180 adults with tetanus. Physical function component scores (PCS), calculated from Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), were assessed in 79 patients at hospital discharge, 3 and 6 months post discharge. RESULTS: Age, temperature, heart rate, lower peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and shorter time from first symptom to admission were associated with MV (OR 1.03 [ 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00, 1.05], p = 0.04; OR 2.10 [95% CI 1.03, 4.60], p = 0.04; OR 1.04 [ 95% CI 1.01, 1.07], p = 0.02); OR 0.80 [95% CI 0.66, 0.94], p = 0.02 and OR 0.65 [95% CI 0.52, 0.79, p < 0.001, respectively). Heart rate, SpO(2) and time from first symptom to admission were associated with ANSD (OR 1.03 [95% CI 1.01, 1.06], p < 0.01; OR 0.95 [95% CI 0.9, 1.00], p = 0.04 and OR 0.64 [95% CI 0.48, 0.80], p < 0.01, respectively). Median [interquartile range] PCS at hospital discharge, 3 and 6 months were 32.37 [24.95–41.57, 53.0 [41.6–56.3] and 54.8 [51.6–57.3], respectively. Age, female sex, admission systolic blood pressure, admission SpO(2), MV, ANSD, midazolam requirement, hospital-acquired infection, pressure ulcer and duration of ICU and hospital stay were associated with reduced 0.25 quantile PCS at 6 months after hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: MV and ANSD may be suitable endpoints for future research. Risk factors for reduced physical function at 3 months and 6 months post discharge suggest that modifiable features during hospital management are important determinants of long-term outcome.

The study aimed to investigate the preoperative prevalence, the associated risk factors, and the locations of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients with closed patella fracture. METHODS: Patients who sustained closed patella fracture between January 1, 2016, and April 1, 2019, were included. Blood analyses and ultrasonography of bilateral lower extremities were routinely performed. Data of demographics, comorbidities, mechanism of injury, fracture type, total hospital stay, time from injury to DVT, and laboratory indexes were prospectively collected and compared between groups with and with non-DVT. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the independent risk factors of DVT. RESULTS: Among the study cohort of 790 patients, 35 cases occurred in preoperative DVTs, indicating a prevalence of 4.4%, with 3.2% distal and 1.2% proximal DVT. Age ≥ 65 years old (OR, 3.0, 95% CI, 1.1–8.1), D-dimer > 0.5 mg/L (OR, 2.3, 95% CI, 1.1–4.8), and albumin < 35 g/L (OR, 2.5, 95% CI, 1.2–5.3) were identified to be risk factors of DVT in closed patella fracture. Among the DVTs, 30 cases (85.7%) occurred in the injured extremity, 3 cases (8.6%) in bilateral extremities, and 2 cases (5.7%) solely in the uninjured extremity. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of preoperative DVT in closed patella fracture was 4.4%, with 3.2% for distal and 1.2% for proximal DVT.

Medicinal plants are well-known sources of bioactive ingredients. This study was designed to determine the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of extracts from Platycerium stemaria. The serial exhaustive extraction method using a solvent of increasing polarity from nonpolar (hexane) to polar (water) was designed to prepare crude extracts; liquid-liquid partition was used to fractionate of active extracts. The extracts and fractions were screened for antimicrobial activity on bacteria and yeasts using the microdilution method. The antioxidant activity was done using DPPH and FRAP assays. Out of the sixteen extracts screened, four (PsHex, PsH2O(H), PsMeOH(EA), and PsMeOH) exhibited potency with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 31.25 to 500 μg/mL. Out of the four extracts, two, including PsMeOH and PsMeOH(EA), exhibited DPPH radical scavenging activity with the antiradical power of 8.94 × 10(−5) and 47.96 × 10(−5), respectively, and ferric reducing antioxidant power values ranging from 0.34 to 61.53 μg equivalent Vit C/g of extract. The phytochemical screening of the promising crude extracts revealed flavonoids, glycosides, phenols, tannins, terpenoids, saponins, and anthraquinones. This study reports the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of P. stemaria for the first time.

On the basis of the self-determination theory, self-management is identified as the mediator, and person–organization fit is recognized as the moderator in this study. We collected two waves of data from 239 Chinese employees. The results of the analysis revealed that the future work self is related to greater employee workplace wellbeing, and self-management mediates the links between them. We also found that the person–organization fit strengthens the positive relationship between future work self and self-management, and the indirect effect of future work self on employee workplace wellbeing through self-management. The results of this study extend the antecedents of employee workplace wellbeing and highlight the importance of future work self in current work-related output.","Li, Zhongqiu; Yang, Yang; Zhang, Xue; Lyu, Zhuo",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8330438/,15

Although the prevalence of anti-Toxocara spp. antibodies has been extensively studied, risk factors of pregnant women of different ages remains to be established. This study was designed to i) assess the presence of anti-Toxocara spp. antibodies in pregnant women that presented to the public health system in a city of southeastern Brazil, and ii) determine the risk factors for toxocariasis in adolescent and adult pregnant women. This cross-sectional study included 280 pregnant women (71 aged up to and including 17 years [adolescents] and 209 aged 18 years and older [adults]). Pregnant women voluntarily agreed to complete a socioeconomic questionnaire and provide serum samples. Anti-Toxocara IgG antibodies were screened by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to assess the risks for toxocariasis. Overall, 20.7% of pregnant women were seropositive (33.8% of adolescents and 16.3% of adults). Prevalence in pregnant adolescents was 2.6-fold higher than in adults (Odds ration [OR]: 2.63; 95% CI: 1.42–4.86, p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis revealed that contact with soil (p = 0.01; OR = 4.76) and being in the first trimester of pregnancy (p = 0.03; OR = 0.17) had significantly greater risk of toxocariasis for adolescents, and attainment of elementary through middle school education level (p = 0.05; OR = 8.33) was a risk factor in adult pregnant women. Toxocariasis is likely underreported and neglected in adolescent pregnant women; this age group should always be monitored for toxocariasis and correspondent clinical signs, particularly at late pregnancy.","de Oliveira Azevedo, Priscila; Lescano, Susana Zevallos; Giuffrida, Rogério; Kmetiuk, Louise Bach; dos Santos, Andrea Pires; Dangoudoubiyam, Sriveny; Biondo, Alexander Welker; Santarém, Vamilton Alvares",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8336820/,15
19808,Isolation and identification of microorganisms associated with automated teller machines on Federal Polytechnic Ede campus,2021-08-05,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by a broad molecular and genetic heterogeneity, which makes it a challenging subject in terms of the underlying mechanisms, response and resistance to treatment, and finding novel therapeutic options. Nowadays, new experimental models (3D in vitro models, in vivo mouse and non-mouse models, and computational studies) allow more detailed studies of hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis and treatment. Here, we provide insights into the current preclinical models frequently applied for the study of hepatocellular carcinoma. ABSTRACT: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most frequent form of primary liver carcinoma, is a heterogenous and complex tumor type with increased incidence, poor prognosis, and high mortality. The actual therapeutic arsenal is narrow and poorly effective, rendering this disease a global health concern. Although considerable progress has been made in terms of understanding the pathogenesis, molecular mechanisms, genetics, and therapeutical approaches, several facets of human HCC remain undiscovered. A valuable and prompt approach to acquire further knowledge about the unrevealed aspects of HCC and novel therapeutic candidates is represented by the application of experimental models. Experimental models (in vivo and in vitro 2D and 3D models) are considered reliable tools to gather data for clinical usability. This review offers an overview of the currently available preclinical models frequently applied for the study of hepatocellular carcinoma in terms of initiation, development, and progression, as well as for the discovery of efficient treatments, highlighting the advantages and the limitations of each model. Furthermore, we also focus on the role played by computational studies (in silico models and artificial intelligence-based prediction models) as promising novel tools in liver cancer research.","Blidisel, Alexandru; Marcovici, Iasmina; Coricovac, Dorina; Hut, Florin; Dehelean, Cristina Adriana; Cretu, Octavian Marius",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8344976/,15

Its practice and history have been researched in the context of experiential learning, but few studies have explicitly examined how solo experiences can affect dimensions of well-being. This study investigated a broad range of well-being pathways provided by being solo, based on data from Norway, Germany, and New Zealand. Methods: Using qualitative content analysis (QCA), the solo debrief responses of 40 participants (26 females, age: 19–64 years) were analysed, applying the PERMA-V framework (emotions, engagement, relationship, meaning, achievement, and vitality). Variations in the reports were explored as a function of the national sample, gender, age, prior solo experiences and expectations. Results: The study suggests that hedonic and eudemonic well-being pathways, represented by the six PERMA-V pillars, interrelate strongly. The experience of a range of positive emotions and connecting process during solo highlights two of the most frequent findings related to well-being pathways. The secondary findings suggest minor variations in the well-being pathways for the different national samples, gender and age. Expectations and prior experiences with solo were identified as context factors with minor impact. Further, the data-driven analysis identified specific physical activities, landscape features, sense-activation, perception of time and ‘good’ weather as relevant to the specific experience. Conclusions: Solo experiences provide for well-being-related pathways in a multitude of ways, which highlights the well-being potential of solo implementation across practical fields beyond outdoor education, such as wilderness therapy, and environmental and planetary health initiatives. Future studies should continue to explore solo’s well-being potential in different settings, especially in the context of non-Western samples.","Petersen, Evi; Bischoff, Annette; Liedtke, Gunnar; Martin, Andrew J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8345692/,15

To date, no study has examined the impact of pre-existing DENV immunity on ZIKV pathogenesis during pregnancy in a translational non-human primate model. Here we show that macaques with a prior DENV-2 exposure had a higher burden of ZIKV vRNA in maternal-fetal interface tissues as compared to DENV-naive macaques. However, pre-existing DENV immunity had no detectable impact on ZIKV replication kinetics in maternal plasma, and all pregnancies progressed to term without adverse outcomes or gross fetal abnormalities detectable at delivery. Understanding the risks of ADE to pregnant women worldwide is critical as vaccines against DENV and ZIKV are developed and licensed and as DENV and ZIKV continue to circulate.","Crooks, Chelsea M.; Weiler, Andrea M.; Rybarczyk, Sierra L.; Bliss, Mason I.; Jaeger, Anna S.; Murphy, Megan E.; Simmons, Heather A.; Mejia, Andres; Fritsch, Michael K.; Hayes, Jennifer M.; Eickhoff, Jens C.; Mitzey, Ann M.; Razo, Elaina; Braun, Katarina M.; Brown, Elizabeth A.; Yamamoto, Keisuke; Shepherd, Phoenix M.; Possell, Amber; Weaver, Kara; Antony, Kathleen M.; Morgan, Terry K.; Newman, Christina M.; Dudley, Dawn M.; Schultz-Darken, Nancy; Peterson, Eric; Katzelnick, Leah C.; Balmaseda, Angel; Harris, Eva; O’Connor, David H.; Mohr, Emma L.; Golos, Thaddeus G.; Friedrich, Thomas C.; Aliota, Matthew T.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8357128/,15

To date, a majority of studies assessing sensory-dependent plasticity have focused on effects from either early onset or long-term sensory loss and little is known how the recent sensory loss affects the human brain. With the aim of determining how recent sensory loss affects cerebral morphology and functional connectivity, we assessed differences between individuals with acquired olfactory loss (duration 7–36 months) and matched healthy controls in their grey matter volume, using multivariate pattern analyses, and functional connectivity, using dynamic connectivity analyses, within and from the olfactory cortex. Our results demonstrate that acquired olfactory loss is associated with altered grey matter volume in, among others, posterior piriform cortex, a core olfactory processing area, as well as the inferior frontal gyrus and angular gyrus. In addition, compared to controls, individuals with acquired anosmia displayed significantly stronger dynamic functional connectivity from the posterior piriform cortex to, among others, the angular gyrus, a known multisensory integration area. When assessing differences in dynamic functional connectivity from the angular gyrus, individuals with acquired anosmia had stronger connectivity from the angular gyrus to areas primary responsible for basic visual processing. These results demonstrate that recently acquired sensory loss is associated with both changed cerebral morphology within core olfactory areas and increase dynamic functional connectivity from olfactory cortex to cerebral areas processing multisensory integration.","Iravani, Behzad; Peter, Moa G.; Arshamian, Artin; Olsson, Mats J.; Hummel, Thomas; Kitzler, Hagen H.; Lundström, Johan N.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8361122/,15

To decrease late-stage drug attrition, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries need to establish biologically relevant models that use phenotypic screening to detect drug-induced toxicity in vitro. In this study, we sought to rapidly detect patterns of cardiotoxicity using high-content image analysis with deep learning and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). We screened a library of 1280 bioactive compounds and identified those with potential cardiotoxic liabilities in iPSC-CMs using a single-parameter score based on deep learning. Compounds demonstrating cardiotoxicity in iPSC-CMs included DNA intercalators, ion channel blockers, epidermal growth factor receptor, cyclin-dependent kinase, and multi-kinase inhibitors. We also screened a diverse library of molecules with unknown targets and identified chemical frameworks that show cardiotoxic signal in iPSC-CMs. By using this screening approach during target discovery and lead optimization, we can de-risk early-stage drug discovery. We show that the broad applicability of combining deep learning with iPSC technology is an effective way to interrogate cellular phenotypes and identify drugs that may protect against diseased phenotypes and deleterious mutations.","Grafton, Francis; Ho, Jaclyn; Ranjbarvaziri, Sara; Farshidfar, Farshad; Budan, Anastasiia; Steltzer, Stephanie; Maddah, Mahnaz; Loewke, Kevin E; Green, Kristina; Patel, Snahel; Hoey, Tim; Mandegar, Mohammad Ali",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8367386/,15

Models of travel are often used that assume the amount of travel to a specific destination decreases as cost of travel increases with higher travel volumes to more populated destinations. Trip duration, the length of time spent in a destination, can also impact travel patterns. We investigated the spatial patterns of travel conditioned on trip duration and find distinct differences between short and long duration trips. In short-trip duration travel networks, trips are skewed towards urban destinations, compared with long-trip duration networks where travel is more evenly spread among locations. Using gravity models to inform connectivity patterns in simulations of disease transmission, we show that pathogens with shorter generation times exhibit initial patterns of spatial propagation that are more predictable among urban locations. Further, pathogens with a longer generation time have more diffusive patterns of spatial spread reflecting more unpredictable disease dynamics.","Giles, John R.; Cummings, Derek A.

With the scientific society’s common goal of fulfilling the target of sustainable development proposed by the UN by 2030, it is necessary to combine efforts based on the scientific and technological knowledge already acquired, to apply these new systems with safety. There are thousands of publications that examine the use of NFs, their benefits and drawbacks, properties, behaviors, etc., but very little is known about the safety of some of these systems at a laboratory and industrial scale. What is the correct form of manipulating, storing, or even destroying them? What is their life cycle, and are they likely to be reused? Depending on the nanoparticles, the characteristics of the base fluid (water, propylene glycol, or even an ionic liquid) and the addition or not of additives/surfactants, the safety issue becomes complex. In this study, general data regarding the safety of NF (synthetic and natural) are discussed, for a necessary reflection leading to the elaboration of a methodology looking at the near future, intended to be sustainable at the level of existing resources, health, and environmental protection, paving the way for safer industrial and medical applications.

Little is known about the true burden of this preventable malady among university students in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systematically estimate the prevalence of burnout among university students in LMICs. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, Web of Science, African Journals Online, and Embase from the inception of each database until February 2021. Original studies were included. No study design or language restrictions were applied. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed using STATA version 16.0. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using Q-statistics and funnel plots, respectively. RESULTS: Fifty-five unique articles, including a total of 27,940 (Female: 16,215, 58.0%) university students from 24 LMICs were included. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used in 43 studies (78.2%). The pooled prevalence of burnout was 12.1% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 11.9–12.3; I(2) = 99.7%, Q = 21,464.1, p = < 0.001).

The METD refers to the least amount of training required to elicit meaningful increases in 1RM strength. A series of five studies utilising mixed methods, were conducted using PL athletes & coaches of all levels in an attempt to better understand the METD for 1RM strength. The studies of this multi-experiment paper are: an interview study with elite PL athletes and highly experienced PL coaches (n = 28), an interview and survey study with PL coaches and PL athletes of all levels (n = 137), two training intervention studies with intermediate-advanced PL athletes (n = 25) and a survey study with competitive PL athletes of different levels (n = 57). PL athletes looking to train with a METD approach can do so by performing ~3–6 working sets of 1–5 repetitions each week, with these sets spread across 1–3 sessions per week per powerlift, using loads above 80% 1RM at a Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) of 7.5–9.5 for 6–12 weeks and expect to gain strength. PL athletes who wish to further minimize their time spent training can perform autoregulated single repetition sets at an RPE of 9–9.5 though they should expect that strength gains will be less likely to be meaningful. However, the addition of 2–3 back-off sets at ~80% of the single repetitions load, may produce greater gains over 6 weeks while following a 2-3-1 squat-bench press-deadlift weekly training frequency. When utilizing accessory exercises in the context of METD, PL athletes typically utilize 1–3 accessory exercises per powerlift, at an RPE in the range of 7–9 and utilize a repetition range of ~6–10 repetitions.","Androulakis-Korakakis, Patroklos; Michalopoulos, Nick; Fisher, James P.; Keogh, Justin; Loenneke, Jeremy P.; Helms, Eric; Wolf, Milo; Nuckols, Greg; Steele, James",Front Sports Act Living,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8435792/,15

Cerium oxide (CeO(2)), which causes oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the environment of tumor cells, was synthesized on the surface of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles to produce nanoparticles that selectively kill cancer cells. In addition, hyaluronic acid (HA) was coated on the cerium’s surface to target CD44-overexpressing tumor cells, and (nat)Zr was chelated on the Fe(3)O(4)@CeO(2) surface to show the usefulness of labeling the radioisotope (89)Zr (T1/2 = 3.3 d). The synthesis of Fe(3)O(4)@CeO(2) was confirmed by Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Field Emission-Transmission Electron Microscope (FE-TEM). The coating of HA was confirmed by FT-IR, X-ray Photoelectron. Spectroscopy (XPS), FE-TEM, Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)/Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The sizes of the prepared nanoparticles were confirmed through FE-TEM and Field Emission-Scanning Electron (FE-SEM) (sizes of 15 to 30 nm), and it was confirmed that (nat)Zr was introduced onto the surface of the nanoparticles using EDS. The particle size of the dispersed material was limited through Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) to about 148 nm in aqueous solution, which was suitable for the (enhanced permeation and retention) EPR effect. It was confirmed that the HA-coated nanoparticles have good dispersibility. Finally, a cytotoxicity evaluation confirmed the ability of CeO(2) to generate ROS and target the delivery of HA. In conclusion, Fe(3)O(4)@CeO(2) can effectively inhibit cancer cells through the activity of cerium oxide in the body when synthesized in nano-sized superparamagnetic coral iron that has magnetic properties. Subsequently, by labeling the radioactive isotope (89)Zr, it is possible to create a theranostic drug delivery system that can be used for cancer diagnosis.","Lee, Chang Ryong; Kim, Gun Gyun; Park, Sung Bum; Kim, Sang Wook",Micromachines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8466504/,15

As the world seeks solutions to such pathogens, global and regional surveillance is required. The aim of the present study was to examine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and clonal relatedness of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates collected for a period of three years through pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Isolate IDs, antimicrobial assays, ESBL-production, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were examined with the Vitek 2 Compact Automated System. IDs were confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, with the resulting sequences being deposited in NCBI databases. DNA was extracted and resistance genes were detected by PCR amplification with appropriate primers. Isolates were extensive (31%) and multidrug-resistant (65%). Pulsotype clusters grouped the isolates into 22 band profiles that showed no specific pattern with phenotypes. Of the isolates, 98% were ESBL-KP, 69% were carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) strains, and 72.5% comprised the carriage of two MBLs (SIM and IMP). Integrons (ISAba1, ISAba2, and IS18) were detected in 69% of the MDR-KP. Additionally, OXA-23 was detected in 67% of the isolates. This study therefore demonstrates clonal diversity among clinical K. pneumoniae, confirming that this bacterium has access to an enormous pool of genes that confer high resistance-developing potential.","Badger-Emeka, Lorina I.; Al-Sultan, Abdulrahman A.; Bohol, Marie Fe F.; Al-Anazi, Mashael R.; Al-Qahtani, Ahmed A.",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8468815/,15

23656,Modeling Evolutionary Dynamics of HIV Infection,2006,"Microfabricated cantilever sensors have attracted much interest in recent years as devices for the fast and reliable detection of small concentrations of molecules in air and solution. In addition to application of such sensors for gas and chemical-vapor sensing, for example as an artificial nose, they have also been employed to measure physical properties of tiny amounts of materials in miniaturized versions of conventional standard techniques such as calorimetry, thermogravimetry, weighing, photothermal spectroscopy, as well as for monitoring chemical reactions such as catalysis on small surfaces. In the past few years, the cantilever-sensor concept has been extended to biochemical applications and as an analytical device for measurements of biomaterials. Because of the label-free detection principle of cantilever sensors, their small size and scalability, this kind of device is advantageous for diagnostic applications and disease monitoring, as well as for genomics or proteomics purposes. The use of microcantilever arrays enables detection of several analytes simultaneously and solves the inherent problem of thermal drift often present when using single microcantilever sensors, as some of the cantilevers can be used as sensor cantilevers for detection, and other cantilevers serve as passivated reference cantilevers that do not exhibit affinity to the molecules to be detected.","Lang, Hans Peter; Hegner, Martin; Gerber, Christoph",Springer Handbook of Nanotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115015/,15

23868,Molecular Techniques for Blood and Blood Product Screening,2006,"Programmed —1 ribosomal frameshifting is a translational recoding strategy that takes place during the elongation phase of protein biosynthesis. Frameshifting occurs in response to specific signals in the mRNA; a slippery sequence, where the ribosome changes frame, and a stimulatory RNA secondary structure, usually a pseudoknot, located immediately downstream. During the frameshift the ribosome slips backwards by a single nucleotide (in the 5′-wards/—1 direction) and continues translation in the new, overlapping reading frame, generating a fusion protein composed of the products of both the original and the —1 frame coding regions. In eukaryotes, frameshifting is largely a phenomenon of virus gene expression and associated predominantly with the expression of viral replicases. Research on frameshifting impacts upon diverse topics, including the ribosomal elongation cycle, RNA structure and function, tRNA modification, virus replication, antiviral intervention, evolution and bioinformatics. This chapter focuses on the structure and function of frameshift-stimulatory RNA pseudoknots and mechanistic aspects of ribosomal frameshifting. A variety of models of the frameshifting process are discussed in the light of recent advances in our understanding of ribosome structure and the elongation cycle.","Brierley, Ian; Gilbert, Robert J.C.; Pennell, Simon",Recoding: Expansion of Decoding Rules Enriches Gene Expression,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119991/,15

Currently, NIV is frequently started outside the intensive care unit (ICU)—not only in the emergency department but also in general wards with less-extensive monitoring facilities [2, 3]. Plant et al. [4] showed that it is possible to apply NIV to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypercapnic acute respiratory failure (ARF) in the general ward provided the respiratory failure is not severe (assessed by pH>7.30). A European survey of a European Respiratory Society Task Force [5] defined the ICU as a location with a high staff-to-patients ratio and facilities for performing invasive ventilation and monitoring. It defined a respiratory intermediate ICU (RIICU), or a high-dependency unit, as a specific clinical area that has the capability of performing continuous vital sign monitoring and a staff-to-patient ratio somewhere between those for an ICU and a general ward (usually 1:4). Clinical criteria for performing NIV in an RIICU are based on mental status and the presence (or absence) of multi-organ failure [1].","Makhabah, Dewi N.; Martino, Federica; Ambrosino, Nicolino",Noninvasive Ventilation in High-Risk Infections and Mass Casualty Events,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120433/,15

They arise from a wide spectrum of developmental, genetic, inflammatory, infectious, and reactive disorders. In the past, there has been a paucity of information and limited understanding regarding their pathogenesis, natural history, imaging findings, and histopathologic features, which often resulted in enormous diagnostic challenges and confusion. In recent years, there has been a substantial improvement in the understanding of interstitial lung disease in the pediatric patient, due to the development of a structured classification system based on etiology of the lung disease, established pathologic criteria for consistent diagnosis, and improvement of thoracoscopic techniques for lung biopsy. Imaging plays an important role in evaluating interstitial lung diseases in infants and children by confirming and characterizing the disorder, generating differential diagnoses, and providing localization for lung biopsy for pathological diagnosis. In this chapter, the authors present epidemiology, challenges and uncertainties of diagnosis, and amplify a recently developed classification system for interstitial lung disease in infants and children with clinical, imaging, and pathological correlation.","Lee, Edward Y.; Cleveland, Robert H.; Langston, Claire",Imaging in Pediatric Pulmonology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120961/,15

The first successful cancer treatments were arsenic-based therapies for leukemias, with the first reported application to cancer in the nineteenth century. However, nitrogen mustards are often accredited as the first modern chemotherapy. Originally intended as a chemical warfare agent in World War I, nitrogen mustard was stockpiled by several countries. During World War II, Axis bombers sunk a ship containing large quantities of nitrogen mustard and killed numerous Allied sailors. This observation birthed the hypothesis that nitrogen mustards might prevent the rapid division of cancer cells, one of the few properties of cancer understood at that time. Today, the hallmarks of cancer as recently redefined by Hanahan and Weinberg include several complex and connected cellular properties that allow for this phenotype: resistance to cell death, sustained angiogenesis, limitless ability to replicate, self-sufficiency in growth factor signaling, unresponsiveness to anti-growth factor signaling, genomic instability and mutation, deregulating cellular energetics, evading immune-mediated destruction, oncogenic inflammation, and invasiveness and metastasis. The identification and understanding of these hallmarks is a direct result of our molecular understanding of cancer that has surfaced relatively recently. Each of these hallmarks is determined by a host of molecules that together represent distinct therapeutic opportunities to target molecules that give rise to these defining properties of cancer.","Allen, Joshua E.; El-Deiry, Wafik S.",The Molecular Basis of Human Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120969/,15

The selection of these accounts is generous and represents a great majority of discussions on this topic, though it is not all-inclusive. It does include, among other theories, the theory that biodiversity is valuable for “unspecified moral reasons” (Sect. 6.1), that it is valuable as a resource (Sect. 6.2), as a service provider (Sect. 6.3), as a sustainer of human life (Sect. 6.4), as a key to human health, both as pharmacopoeia and as an inoculation against infection (Sect. 6.5), as the progenitor of human biophilic tendencies (Sect. 6.6), as a generator of (more) value (Sect. 6.7), as font of knowledge (Sect. 6.8), as having option (and quasi-option) value (Sect. 6.9), as transformative (Sect. 6.10), as having experiential value (Sect. 6.11), and as an expression of the natural order (Sect. 6.12). The chapter concludes (Sect. 6.13) with some proposals that are not customarily offered as self-contained theories of biodiversity value, but that are often suggested as still heavily influencing evaluation. These include what conservation biologists call “viability” and “endangerment” as well as conservation “efficiency”.

24865,Multiplex PCR for Detection and Identification of Microbial Pathogens,2018-11-10,"Mice infected with neurotropic strains of coronavirus develop acute encephalomyelitis and eliminate infectious virus. However, control of acute infection is incomplete resulting in persistence of viral RNA in the central nervous system (CNS) associated with ongoing primary demyelination. A high prevalence of virus specific CD8 and CD4 T cells within the CNS correlates with ex vivo cytolytic activity and IFN-γ secretion, which are both required for virus reduction during the acute infection. Although most infected cell types are susceptible to perforin mediated clearance, IFN-γ is required for controlling infection of oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, by enhancing class I expression and inducing class II expression within resident CNS cells IFN-γ optimizes T cell receptor dependent functions. In addition to its direct anti viral activity, these multifactorial effects make IFN-γ more essential than perforin for viral control. CD4 T cells enhance CD8 T cell expansion, survival and effectiveness. Although both CD8 and CD4 T cells are retained within the CNS during persistence, they cannot control viral recrudescence in the absence of humoral immunity. Demyelination can be mediated by either CD8 or CD4 T cells; however, although a variety of effector molecules have been excluded, a dominant common denominator remains elusive. Thus concerted efforts to control infection coincide with a variety of potential mechanisms causing chronic demyelinating disease.","Bergmann, Cornelia C; Stohlman, Stephen A; Perlman, Stanley",Experimental Models of Multiple Sclerosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121318/,15

This chapter will focus on pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), immunocompromised pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia. The pathogenesis for developing pneumonia varies; it can occur by direct inhalation of infectious particles in the air or aspiration, direct extension from the upper airways, and hematogenous spread. There are multiple levels of defense against pathogen invasion including anatomic barriers, as well as innate and adaptive immunity, which may be compromised in PICU patients. The etiologies of pediatric pneumonia vary depending on age, host condition, and environmental factors like time of year and location. Viruses remain the most common form of lower respiratory tract infection in children, especially in neonates. Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia continues to be most prevalent in younger children as well, most often affecting children less than 5 years of age who are otherwise healthy. Despite immunizations and public health initiatives, the most common bacterial causes of CAP have remained largely unchanged over the last several decades and include: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae (including non-typable strains) and Moraxella catarrhalis. Pulmonary infection in an immunocompromised host provides a much broader differential and must be aggressively treated without delay. This chapter will also address various imaging modalities and typical findings with pediatric pneumonia. Methods for pathogen identification are broad and range from non-specific markers of illness to invasive techniques for culture. The mainstay of therapy continues to be antibiotics tailored to the patient and presumed etiology; more novel therapies may include corticosteroids or macrolide antibiotics for immune modulation. In those patients with pneumonia with effusion or empyema, drainage therapies with thoracostomy tubes or a VATS procedure may be indicated.","Morgan, Carrie I.; Shah, Samir S.",Pediatric Critical Care Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121765/,15

Noroviruses (NoVs) are a group of genetically diverse RNA viruses that cause the great majority of nonbacterial gastroenteritis in humans. However, there is still no vaccine licensed for human use to prevent NoV GE. The lack of a tissue culture system and a small animal model further hinders the development of NoV vaccines. Virus-like particles (VLPs) that mimic the antigenic architecture of authentic virions, however, can be produced in insect, mammalian, and plant cells by the expression of the capsid protein. The particulate nature and high-density presentation of viral structure proteins on their surface render VLPs as a premier vaccine platform with superior safety, immunogenicity, and manufacturability. Therefore, this chapter focuses on the development of effective NoV vaccines based on VLPs of capsid proteins. The expression and structure of NoV VLPs, especially VLPs of Norwalk virus, the prototype NoV, are extensively discussed. The ability of NoV VLPs in stimulating a potent systemic and mucosal anti-NoV immunity through oral and intranasal delivery in mice is presented. The advantages of plant expression systems as a novel production platform for VLP-based NoV vaccines are discussed in light of their cost-effectiveness, production speed, and scalability. Recent achievements from the first successful demonstration of NoV VLP production in plant expression system under the current Good Manufacture Practice (cGMP) regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are detailed. Moreover, results of human clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of insect and plant-derived NoV VLPs are also presented. Due to the diversity of capsid protein among different NoV strains and its rapid antigenic drift, we speculate that vaccine development should focus on multivalent VLP vaccines derived from capsid proteins of the most prevalent strains. With the very recent approval of the first plant-made biologics by the FDA, we also speculate that plant-based production systems will play an important role in manufacturing such multivalent VLP-based NoV vaccines.","Chen, Qiang",Molecular Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122369/,15

Tissue culture techniques have been utilized extensively to investigate questions pertaining to physiology and disease. The isolation and propagation of human epithelial cells has allowed investigators to begin to characterize the interactions and reactions that occur in response to various stimuli. Moreover, the culture of other human tissue has allowed researchers to investigate pathological cascades as well as other physiological responses.

25911,Protein Microarrays for the Detection of Biothreats,2009,"When the WTO/TRIPS Agreement entered into force in 1995, around 100 countries had adopted compulsory licensing under national intellectual property law. The compulsory licensing measure can be effective in dealing with situations inhibiting access to medicines, for example when a patent holder fails to use the patent in the granting country or when he or she maintains artificially high prices for patented articles. Despite the significant international development, it remains to be seen how the flexibility margins provided by the TRIPS provisions can be used as safeguards to protect public health interests of the poor countries. Effective mechanisms are also required to support countries that are unable to make effective use of compulsory licensing due to the inefficiency of manufacturing capacity. This chapter examines the problem of using the legal mechanism of compulsory licensing by developing countries. It looks at Thailand’s experiences with the use of compulsory licensing to increase access to medicines. Since the majority of compulsory licences issued around the world are related to pharmaceutical patents, the chapter highlights the use of compulsory licensing in the context of a range of public health responses. It first discusses the use by Thailand of the compulsory government use licensing to increase access to medicines. It also examines international rules on compulsory licensing, including the provisions of the Paris Convention, the TRIPS Agreement, and the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health. Finally, the chapter discusses various legal issues under the Thai Patent Act regarding the compulsory licensing provisions. It also highlights the possible impact, in a broad sense, of the use of legal mechanisms such as compulsory licensing, which aims to effectively maintain fair market competition and dilute the monopoly power of the patent holder.","Kuanpoth, Jakkrit",Compulsory Licensing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122632/,15

Research advances exploiting SiNWs configured as FETs for biomolecule analysis have emerged as one of the most promising and powerful platforms for label-free, real-time, and sensitive electrical detection of proteins as well as many other biological species. In this chapter, we first briefly introduce the fundamental principle for semiconductor NW-FET sensors. Representative examples of semiconductor NW sensors are then summarized for sensitive chemical and biomolecule detection, including proteins, nucleic acids, viruses and small molecules. In addition, this chapter discusses several electrical and surface functionalization methods for enhancing the sensitivity of semiconductor NW sensors.","Zhang, Anqi; Zheng, Gengfeng; Lieber, Charles M.",Nanowires,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123897/,15

The enzymatic mechanism for a single turnover is reasonably well understood based on biochemical and structural studies that are consistent with divalent metal ion dependent nonspecific nicking of a phosphodiester bond in one of the strands of double stranded DNA. Recombinant human DNase I (rhDNase I, rhDNase, Pulmozyme(®), dornase alfa) has been expressed in mammalian cell culture in Chinese hamster ovary cells and developed clinically where it is aerosolized into the airways for treatment of pulmonary disease in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). rhDNase I hydrolyzes the DNA in purulent sputum of CF patients and reduces sputum viscoelasticity. Reduction of high molecular weight DNA into smaller fragments by treatment with aerosolized rhDNase I has been proposed as the mechanism to reduce the mucus viscosity and improve mucus clearability from obstructed airways in patients. The improved clearance of the purulent mucus enhances pulmonary function and reduces recurrent exacerbations of respiratory symptoms. rhDNase I was approved for clinical use in 1993 and has been widely used as a safe and effective therapy for CF patients. The use of rhDNase I has also been investigated in other diseases where exogenous DNA has been implicated in the disease pathology.","Lazarus, Robert A.; Wagener†, Jeffrey S.",Pharmaceutical Biotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124075/,15

27094,Impact Factors!,2016-12-14,"Most recommendation systems face challenges from products that change with time, such as popular or seasonal products, since traditional market basket analysis or collaborative filtering analysis are unable to recommend new products to customers due to the fact that the products are not yet purchased by customers. Although the recommendation systems can find customer groups that have similar interests as target customers, brand new products often lack ratings and comments. Similarly, products that are less often purchased, such as furniture and home appliances, have fewer records of ratings; therefore, the chances of being recommended are often lower. This research attempts to analyze customers' purchasing behaviors based on product features from transaction records and product feature databases. Customers' preferences toward particular features of products are analyzed and then rules of customer interest profiles are thus drawn in order to recommend customers products that have potential attraction with customers. The advantage of this research is its ability of recommending to customers brand new products or rarely purchased products as long as they fit customer interest profiles; a deduction which traditional market basket analysis and collaborative filtering methods are unable to do. This research uses a two-stage clustering technique to find customers that have similar interests as target customers and recommend products to fit customers' potential requirements. Customers' interest profiles can explain recommendation results and the interests on particular features of products can be referenced for product development, while a one-to-one marketing strategy can improve profitability for companies.","Weng, Sung-Shun; Liu, Mei-Ju",Expert Syst Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127642/,15

28154,Forthcoming articles,2005-05-10,"Organisations are increasingly outsourcing information systems (IS) to external service providers. These IS outsourcing decisions are driven by multiple organisational factors such as outsource vendor expertise and knowledge, process performance improvement due to better IS, and enabling the organisation’s ability to focus on its core capabilities. In order to harnass such vendor knowledge to achieve business outcomes, the importance of a shared knowledge asset base, between the client organisation and outsource vendor, is emphasised. However, outcomes from IS outsourcing remain poor despite consideration of experience and research. Therefore, the aim of this study is to design and propose a knowledge asset management implementation framework that may be applied in IS outsourcing projects. The proposed framework was evaluated by an experienced programme director and its applicability was tested against a large scale IS outsourcing project. The purpose of such a framework is to enable organisations to manage and institutionalise knowledge assets that are created during the IS outsourcing project and to ensure that the organisation may gain the benefit from such knowledge assets as an outcome of the IS outsourcing arrangement.","Smuts, Hanlie; Maramba, George","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134288/,15

28867,Progress in the synthesis of iridoids and related natural products,2007-09-02,"Searching literature for a systematic review begins with a manually constructed search strategy by an expert information specialist. The typical process of constructing search strategies is often undocumented, ad-hoc, and subject to individual expertise, which may introduce bias in the systematic review. A new method for objectively deriving search strategies has arisen from information specialists attempting to address these shortcomings. However, this proposed method still presents a number of manual, ad-hoc interventions, and trial-and-error processes, potentially still introducing bias into systematic reviews. Moreover, this method has not been rigorously evaluated on a large set of systematic review cases, thus its generalisability is unknown. In this work, we present a computational adaptation of this proposed objective method. Our adaptation removes the human-in-the-loop processes involved in the initial steps of creating a search strategy for a systematic review; reducing bias due to human factors and increasing the objectivity of the originally proposed method. Our proposed computational adaptation further enables a formal and rigorous evaluation over a large set of systematic reviews. We find that our computational adaptation of the original objective method provides an effective starting point for information specialists to continue refining. We also identify a number of avenues for extending and improving our adaptation to further promote supporting information specialists.","Scells, Harrisen; Zuccon, Guido; Koopman, Bevan; Clark, Justin",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148214/,15

This transformation is driven by the information these measurements have contributed for a better understanding of the molecular definition of disease and of the mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity for new drugs. As this information is translated into accurate genomic biomarkers of efficacy and toxicity, drug development processes supported by these measurements are becoming more efficient. This transformation is exemplified in the conversion of P450 enzyme activity measurements to gene expression in drug metabolism studies, the measurement of cytokine and chemokine genomic expression levels as clinical markers, and the identification and evaluation of genomic biomarkers of nephrotoxicity.

31339,The Continuing Search for Antiviral Drugs,2008-04-10,"Natural killer (NK) cells are cells of the nonspecific immune system lysing altered self‐cells. A noncytolytic subset of NK cells may serve a regulatory role by secreting cytokines. Bacteria translocating across the gastrointestinal mucosa are presumed to gain access to NK cells, as consumption of certain lactic acid bacteria has been shown to increase in vivo NK cytotoxicity. Here, we investigated how human gut flora‐derived lactobacilli affect NK cells in vitro, by measuring proliferation and IFN‐γ production of human NK cells upon bacterial stimulation. CD3(–)CD56(+)NK cells were isolated from buffy coats by negative isolation using non‐NK lineage‐specific antibodies and magnetic beads. NK cells were incubated with 10μg/ml UV‐inactivated bacteria or 10μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA) for 4 days. Proliferation was assessed by incorporation of radioactive thymidine into NK‐cell DNA. The IFN‐γ concentration was measured by ELISA. Incubation of NK cells with a Lactobacillus acidophilus strain increased the proliferation of the NK cells and induced IFN‐γ production, both to levels comparable to PHA stimulation. The proliferative response was further enhanced with autologous monocytes present, probably because cytokines, secreted by monocytes having engulfed bacteria, stimulated the NK cells. In contrast, a Lactobacillus paracasei strain caused the NK cells to proliferate only in the presence of monocytes. These results demonstrate that various strains of lactobacilli have the capacity to activate NK cells in vitro, in a monocyte‐dependent or ‐independent way. Hence, the encounter of NK cells with lactic acid bacteria will affect NK‐cell activation. Such activation of NK cells may potentially skew an on‐going or subsequent immune response towards a Th1 response.","Fink, L. N.; Christensen, H.

31514,Equine Viral Arteritis,2009-05-15,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), the single most important etiologic agent of common colds, are small viruses composed of an icosahedral protein shell that encapsidates a single, positive RNA strand. Multiplication of HRVs occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell. To produce infection, HRVs must first attach to specific cellular receptors embedded in the plasma membrane. Ninety percent of HRVs immunogenic variants use as receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a cell surface glycoprotein that promotes intercellular signaling in processes derived from inflammation response. As HRV receptor, ICAM-1 positions the virus to within striking distance of the membrane, and then triggers a conformational change in the virus that ultimately results in delivery of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm, across a lipid bilayer. The interaction between ICAM-1 and HRVs has been analyzed by the combination of crystal structures of HRVs and ICAM-1 fragments with electron microscopy reconstructions of the complexes. The resulting molecular models are useful to address questions about receptor recognition, binding specificity, and mechanisms by which ICAM-1 induces virus uncoating.","Bella, Jordi; Rossmann, Michael G.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172389/,15

32340,Phytochemicals as Antiviral Agents: Recent Updates,2020-05-12,"Deep neural networks usually require careful tuning of hyperparameters to show their best performance. However, with the size of state-of-the-art neural networks growing larger, the evaluation cost of the traditional Bayesian optimization has become unacceptable in most cases. Moreover, most practical problems usually require good hyperparameter configurations within a limited time budget. To speed up the hyperparameter optimization, the successive halving technique is used to stop poorly-performed configurations as early as possible. In this paper, we propose a novel hyperparameter optimization method FastHO, which combines the progressive multi-fidelity technique with successive halving under a multi-armed bandit framework. Furthermore, we employ Bayesian optimization to guide the selection of initial configurations and an efficient data subsampling based method to warm start the surrogate model of Bayesian optimization. Extensive empirical evaluation on a broad range of neural networks and datasets shows that FastHO is not only effective to speed up hyperparameter optimization but also can achieve better anytime performance and final performance than the state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization methods.","Zhu, Guanghui; Zhu, Ruancheng",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206157/,15

C6 Cells,2007-05-09,"With the explosive growth of social media on the Web, opinion mining has been extensively investigated and consists of the automatic identification and extraction of opinions, emotions, and sentiments from text and multimedia data. One of the tasks involved in opinion mining is Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) which aims at identifying aspects (attributes or characteristics) that have been explicitly evaluated in a sentence or a document. For example, in the sentence “The picture quality of this camera is amazing”, the aspect term is “picture quality”. This work proposes POS-AttWD-BLSTM-CRF, a neural network architecture using a deep learning model, and minimal feature engineering, to solve the problem of ATE in opinionated documents. The proposed architecture consists of a BLSTM-CRF classifier that uses the part-of-speech tag (POS tags) as an additional feature, along with a BLSTM encoder with an attention mechanism to allow the incorporation of another relevant feature: the grammatical relations between words. The experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves promising results with minimal feature engineering comparing to the state-of-the-art solutions.","Zschornack Rodrigues Saraiva, Felipe; Linhares Coelho da Silva, Ticiana; Fernandes de Macêdo, José Antônio",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266433/,15
33673,Blood Transfusion and Blood Substitutes,2011-06-22,"App reviews provide a rich source of user opinions that can support requirement engineering activities. Analysing them manually to find these opinions, however, is challenging due to their large quantity and noisy nature. To overcome the problem, automated approaches have been proposed for so-called opinion mining. These approaches facilitate the analysis by extracting features discussed in app reviews and identifying their associated sentiments. The effectiveness of these approaches has been evaluated using different methods and datasets. Unfortunately, replicating these studies to confirm their results and to provide benchmarks of different approaches is a challenging problem. We address the problem by extending previous evaluations and performing a comparison of these approaches. In this paper, we present an empirical study in which, we evaluated feature extraction and sentiment analysis approaches on the same dataset. The results show these approaches achieve lower effectiveness than reported originally, and raise an important question about their practical use.","Dąbrowski, Jacek; Letier, Emmanuel; Perini, Anna; Susi, Angelo",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266457/,15

The basic idea of RXA is to focus on simple ordering relationships between the expression of small sets of genes rather than their raw values. We propose a paradigm shift as we extend RXA concept to tree-based Advanced Relative Expression Analysis (ARXA). The main contribution is a decision tree with splitting nodes that consider relative fraction comparisons between multiple gene pairs. In addition, to face the enormous computational complexity of RXA, the most time-consuming part which is scoring all possible gene pairs in each splitting node is parallelized using GPU. This way the algorithm allows searching for more tailored interactions between sub-groups of genes in a reasonable time. Experiments carried out on 8 cancer-related datasets show not only significant improvement in accuracy and speed of our approach in comparison to various RXA solutions but also new interesting patterns between subgroups of genes.","Czajkowski, Marcin; Jurczuk, Krzysztof; Kretowski, Marek",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304016/,15

The algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase determines all combinations of best response strategies for each player using classical computation. The second phase finds pure Nash equilibria using a quantum annealing device by mapping the computed combinations to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization formulation based on the Set Cover problem. We empirically evaluate Q-Nash on D-Wave’s Quantum Annealer 2000Q using different graphical game topologies. The results with respect to solution quality and computing time are compared to a Brute Force algorithm and the Iterated Best Response heuristic.","Roch, Christoph; Phan, Thomy; Feld, Sebastian; Müller, Robert; Gabor, Thomas; Hahn, Carsten; Linnhoff-Popien, Claudia",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304779/,15

In this paper, we summarise some major steps in phytoplankton ecology in the context of mechanisms underlying phytoplankton diversity. Here, we provide a framework for phytoplankton community assembly and an overview of measures on taxonomic and functional diversity. We show how ecological theories on species competition together with modelling approaches and laboratory experiments helped understand species coexistence and maintenance of diversity in phytoplankton. The non-equilibrium nature of phytoplankton and the role of disturbances in shaping diversity are also discussed. Furthermore, we discuss the role of water body size, productivity of habitats and temperature on phytoplankton species richness, and how diversity may affect the functioning of lake ecosystems. At last, we give an insight into molecular tools that have emerged in the last decades and argue how it has broadened our perspective on microbial diversity. Besides historical backgrounds, some critical comments have also been made.

In certain models, some neurons receive outer input, while other neurons produce the output of the system. According to this observation, some neurons are categorized as input neurons and the others are the state neurons and output neurons. The output of the system is provided as a limit of an iteration process, which may converge to an equilibrium point, but limit cycles or chaotic behaviour may also show up. In this paper, we examine the existence and uniqueness of fixed points for two types of input-output fuzzy cognitive maps. Moreover, we use network-based measures like in-degree, out-degree and connectivity, to express conditions for the convergence of the iteration process.","Harmati, István Á.; Kóczy, László T.",Rough Sets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338157/,15

The absence of vaccine/drugs to counter COVID-19 has scrambled scientific communities to repurpose available medicines/vaccines. As the virus is known to mutate, using the whole genome sequences, the transmission dynamics and molecular evolutionary models were evaluated for South Asian countries to determine the evolutionary rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Phylogenetic analyses were done using the data available on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Different nucleotide substitution models and molecular evolutionary models were analyzed to see how SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted in the populations. Models for the viral ‘S’ and ‘N’ protein from selected strains were constructed, validated, and analyzed to determine the mutations and discover the potential therapeutics against this deadly viral disease. We found that the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) nucleotide substitution model was the best model with the lowest Bayesian information criterion (BIC) scores. Molecular clock RelTime analysis showed the evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 substitutions in the genome was at 95% confidence interval, and heterogeneity was observed. Several mutations in the viral S-protein were found with one in the receptor-binding domain concerning SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan-1/S-Protein. Nucleocapsid protein also showed mutations in the strains from India and Sri Lanka. Our analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving at a diverse rate. The mutation leading to substitution in the nucleotide sequence occurred in the genome during the transmission of COVID-19 among individuals in the South Asian countries.

Developing effective strategies for predicting the influenza outbreak which may prevent or at least get ready for a new influenza pandemic is now a top global public health priority. Owing to the complexity of influenza outbreaks that are usually involved with spatial and temporal characteristics of both biological and social systems, however, it is a challenging task to achieve the real-time monitoring of influenza outbreaks. In this study, by exploring the rich dynamical information of the city network during influenza outbreaks, we developed a computational method, the minimum-spanning-tree-based dynamical network marker (MST-DNM), to identify the tipping point or critical stage prior to the influenza outbreak. With historical records of influenza outpatients between 2009 and 2018, the MST-DNM strategy has been validated by accurate predictions of the influenza outbreaks in three Japanese cities/regions, respectively, i.e., Tokyo, Osaka, and Hokkaido. These successful applications show that the early-warning signal was detected 4 weeks on average ahead of each influenza outbreak. The results show that our method is of considerable potential in the practice of public health surveillance.","Yang, Kun; Xie, Jialiu; Xie, Rong; Pan, Yucong; Liu, Rui; Chen, Pei",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7547339/,15

The currently available avian influenza H5N1 vaccines for poultry are clade-specific. Therefore, an effective vaccine for preventing and controlling H5N1 viruses belonging to different clades needs to be developed. RESULTS: Recombinant L. lactis/pNZ8148-Spax-HA was generated, and the influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA) protein of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) was displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis). Spax was used as an anchor protein. Chickens vaccinated orally with unadjuvanted L. lactis/pNZ8148-Spax-HA could produce significant humoral and mucosal responses and neutralizing activities against H5N1 viruses belonging to different clades. Importantly, unadjuvanted L. lactis/pNZ8148-Spax-HA conferred cross-clade protection against lethal challenge with different H5N1 viruses in the chicken model. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights into the cross-clade protection conferred by unadjuvanted L. lactis/pNZ8148-Spax-HA, and the results might help the establishment of a promising platform for the development of a safe and effective H5N1 cross-clade vaccine for poultry.","Lei, Han; Gao, Tong; Cen, Qianhong; Peng, Xiaojue",Microb Cell Fact,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7557258/,15

It utilizes data from Wind Info Database (WIND) and finds that the adoption of EVA as a performance evaluation metric incentivizes public administrators to increase the overall efficiency of the public organizations under study. The study suggests that public administrators make prudent investment and operating decisions after the adoption of EVA as their performance evaluation metric, thereby increasing the overall organizational performance.

Long-term survival is limited by the development of a variety of opportunistic infections and rejection. Optimal means of differential diagnosis of infection and rejection have not been established. With these challenges in mind, we tried to use transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) rapid on-site cytological evaluation (ROSE), metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), and routine histologic examination to timely distinguish infection and rejection, and accurately detect etiologic pathogens. We reviewed the medical records of all patients diagnosed with infection or rejection by these means from December 2017 to September 2018 in our center. We identified seven recipients whose clinical course was complicated by infection or rejection. Three patients were diagnosed with acute rejection, organizing pneumonia, and acute fibrinoid organizing pneumonia, respectively. Four of the seven patients were diagnosed with infections, including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, cytomegalovirus, Aspergillus, and bacterial pneumonia. These patients recovered after proper treatment. TBLB + ROSE + mNGS might be a good method to accurately detect etiologic pathogens, which may help us to facilitate the use of targeted and precision medicine therapy in postoperative complications and avoid unnecessary potential adverse effects of drugs.","Wang, Qing; Feng, Jing; Zhang, Ji; Shi, Lingzhi; Jin, Zhixian; Liu, Dong; Wu, Bo; Chen, Jingyu",Open Med (Wars),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7706120/,15

However, clinical utility and impact on clinical outcome of ICP monitoring remain controversial. Follow-up imaging using cranial computed tomography (CCT) is commonly performed in these patients. This retrospective cohort study reports on complication rates of ICP measurement in severe TBI patients, as well as on findings and clinical consequences of follow-up CCT. METHODS: We performed a retrospective clinical chart review of severe TBI patients with invasive ICP measurement treated at an urban level I trauma center between January 2007 and September 2017. RESULTS: Clinical records of 213 patients were analyzed. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission was 6 with an intra-hospital mortality of 20.7%. Overall, complications in 12 patients (5.6%) related to the invasive ICP-measurement were recorded of which 5 necessitated surgical intervention. Follow-up CCT scans were performed in 192 patients (89.7%). Indications for follow-up CCTs included routine imaging without clinical deterioration (n = 137, 64.3%), and increased ICP values and/or clinical deterioration (n = 55, 25.8%). Follow-up imaging based on clinical deterioration and increased ICP values were associated with significantly increased likelihoods of worsening of CCT findings compared to routinely performed CCT scans with an odds ratio of 5.524 (95% CI 1.625–18.773) and 6.977 (95% CI 3.262–14.926), respectively. Readings of follow-up CCT imaging resulted in subsequent surgical intervention in six patients (3.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Invasive ICP-monitoring in severe TBI patients was safe in our study population with an acceptable complication rate. We found a high number of follow-up CCT. Our results indicate that CCT imaging in patients with invasive ICP monitoring should only be considered in patients with elevated ICP values and/or clinical deterioration.","Bumberger, Alexander; Braunsteiner, Tomas; Leitgeb, Johannes; Haider, Thomas",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7754179/,15

A hydrogel was fabricated from an aqueous solution of gelatin, sodium alginate and carboxymethylcellulose sodium by radiation-induced cross-linking at room temperature, which was aiming at the application of debridement glue paste. The swelling ratio of the debridement glue paste is 30 times to its dry weight, when the weight ratio of gelatin/sodium alginate/carboxymethylcellulose sodium was 2:2:2 and the absorbed dose was 20 kGy, with dose rate of 20 Gy/min. The extrusion and compressive assay have confirmed that it possessed stable mechanical strength, and the weight ratio had little effect on the molecular structure by FTIR and TGA. Cell culture experiments demonstrated the debridement glue pastes with the cytotoxicity of grade 0 or 1 (biosafe). The debridement glue paste group could remove the necrotic tissue within 4 days and showed complete wound healing within 18 days; comparatively, the control group without treatment removed the necrotic tissue within 10 days and showed complete wound healing within 26 days in animal experiments using rabbit scald model. Histologic analysis exhibited that more granulation tissue was observed in debridement glue paste. The result of this study suggested that debridement glue pastes had excellent biocompatibility, could selectively remove necrotic tissue, induced granulation tissue formation and accelerated the wound healing.","Song, Yana; Xu, Lin; Xu, Ling; Deng, Li",Polym Bull (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7789080/,15

This paper presents the precautions for safer use of chemicals handled by workers during quarantine and disinfection and proposes policy suggestions. The COVID-19 pandemic will have long-lasting effects on workers. Syndromic methods for monitoring illness outside of healthcare settings can be useful adjuncts to conventional disease reporting.

Judges in modern democracies should protect democracy both from terrorism and from the means the state wishes to use to fight terrorism. Judges meet their supreme test when they face situations of war and terrorism. The protection of human rights of every individual is a duty much more formidable in situations of war or terrorism than in times of peace and security. But if judges fail in their role in times of war and terrorism, they will be unable to fulfil their role in times of peace and tranquility. It is a myth to think that it is possible to maintain a sharp distinction between the status of human rights during a period of war and the status of human rights during a period of peace.

The aim of this study is to determine post-operative mortality and the risk of developing COVID-19 in a COVID-19 negative population undergoing elective surgical care in a COVID-clean facility. We also explored patient experiences and satisfaction as well patient reported post-operative COVID related symptoms through a patient satisfaction survey. METHOD: A patient satisfaction survey was built into the service which was performed by means of a telephone follow-up at 30 days from procedure. One of the aspects of the service review was to capture data on patients developing COVID-19 symptoms post-operatively but not requiring hospital admission or testing. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: Our study has shown promising results with the early outcomes of elective surgical care delivered through a COVID-clean facility with no mortality, low morbidity and high patient satisfaction across all 5 specialties (Plastic surgery, Urology, Gynaecology, General Surgery) in 455 patients operated on over 10 weeks.

METHODS: We invited 28 Canadian gastroenterology societies, 14 academic centres and 101 community hospitals and private clinics to have their gastroenterologists engage in an online mixed methods survey from December 2020 - March 2021. The survey explored the impact of pandemic-related restrictions on gastroenterologists managing IBD patients and the impact on clinical decision-making, rates of consultation, investigations and endoscopies conducted before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: 59 gastroenterologists (59.3% male) participated in our study with 40.7% having completed additional training in IBD. Respondents mean age was 43.7 years with 30.5% practising independently for a duration of less than or equal to 5 years. The majority of respondents were from Ontario (43.1%), Quebec (31%) and British Columbia (13.8%) with 62.7% practising primarily at an academic centre. 93.2% of respondents reported that their practice was affected by the pandemic. 44.6% note a reduction in the number of total consultations completed. Only 60% were able to arrange endoscopies for patients in an active IBD flare at an appropriate time interval compared to their pre-COVID practice. During the pandemic, 87.3% reported a reduction in the total endoscopies performed, with 43.8% of those individuals noting a minimum reduction of 25% of previous volumes. The following barriers attributed to the decrease in endoscopies performed during the pandemic: institutional-imposed restriction on daily allowed endoscopies (97.9%), indication for endoscopy was non-urgent (68.8%) and patient-requested cancellation due to a fear of contracting COVID-19 (87.5%). 63.6% of respondents were able to arrange outpatient laboratory investigations in less than 1-week prior to the pandemic vs. 41.8% arranging similar tests in 1–2 weeks during the pandemic. 50.9% were able to arrange diagnostic investigations in 1–2 months before the pandemic vs. 65% arranging similar tests in 3-months or more during the pandemic. When advancing drug therapy in IBD patients before versus during the pandemic, respondents reported the following factors as playing a crucial role in clinical decision making: patient symptomatology (87% vs. 79.3%), laboratory investigations (94.8% vs. 96.6%), diagnostic imaging (89.7% vs. 81%) and endoscopy findings (89.7% vs 72.4%). CONCLUSION: We illustrate that Canadian gastroenterologists have been affected by the pandemic, with decreases in endoscopy performance related to access and patient preference and less decision-making guided by endoscopy. Outpatient access to urgent investigations was reduced.","Mikail, M; Malhi, G; Wilson, A; Khanna, R",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194886/,15

One mode in which they are evaded is through the formal revision or abrogation of a constitution. Such a process accelerates a pernicious cycle in which constitutional non-compliance begets constitutional instability, which in turn begets subsequent non-compliance. Such a non-compliance cycle is a core problem in law, and one that deserves more careful examination in various domains. This essay unearths original historical evidence of term-limit provisions and executive tenure in an effort to illuminate and evaluate the phenomenon. A background concern is that of international (and domestic) approaches to term-limit evasion. One intellectual response is that of militant democracy. The logic of that approach would imply the entrenchment and protection of term limits, which would presumably disrupt the cycle of non-compliance.","Elkins, Zachary",Const Polit Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8216587/,15
55178,Nanomechanical sensor for rapid and ultrasensitive detection of tumor markers in serum using nanobody,2021-06-29,"BACKGROUND: Current reports show that people infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 do not recover completely, and even asymptomatic COVID‐19 patients may experience slight changes in their overall health, which is the basis of the new area of study termed “Long‐Haul COVID”. Our hypothesis is that even in the asymptomatic infection, exposures to the viral spike protein are enough to induce long‐lasting changes in baseline genetic expression. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to survey what type of cell biological processes would be affected in human primary bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) post‐exposure to spike protein and whether they would persist post‐recovery. METHODS: Herein, we advanced an Air Liquid Interface (ALI) cell culture technique to simulate the physiological conditions in the lung airway in vitro. Briefly, HBECs were grown and differentiated, before treatment with either a low (50 ng/mL) or high (5 ug/mL) concentration of recombinant SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein for 4 hours. After a 48‐hour recovery, cells were processed for RNA extractions and qPCR to screen genes using Qiagen RT(2) Profiler PCR Arrays; data were analyzed in GeneGlobe. RESULTS: We used the (2^ (‐Delta Delta CT)) method to analyze the gene expression data, using both ACTB and RPLP0 as reference genes for normalization. Our survey included genes related to oxidative stress, hypoxia, osmotic stress, cell death, inflammatory response, DNA damage and unfolded protein response. We found that the genes CCL2, IL1A, IL1B, and MMP9 showed fold changes greater than 2.00 in the low and high concentration treatments after recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein is enough to change the baseline protein expression in primary HBECs. After recovery, genes related to immune response retained changes in gene expression, and these may indicate relevant long‐term effects in asymptomatic patients. Additionally, the interplay between immune response and other pathways after SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein exposure should be investigated in the future.","Evans, Nicholas; Nichols, Jacob; Pruitt, Kevin; Almodovar, Sharilyn",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239499/,15

Methodology We conducted a cross-sectional study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of 184,711 POD inpatients. A binomial logistic regression model was used to evaluate the odds ratio (OR) of association for mortality risk due to comorbidities (substance use disorders (SUD) and medical complications) in POD inpatients. Results POD inpatients were majorly females (54.1%), older adults aged 51-75 years (48.5%), whites (81.5%), and from lower household income quartet (32.8%). The most prevalent comorbid SUD among POD inpatients was alcohol (15.7%), followed by cannabis (5.7%), cocaine (4.2%), and amphetamine (1.8%). Comorbid alcohol use disorders had a minimally increased association with mortality but were not statistically significant (OR = 1.036; P = 0.438). POD in patients with cardiac arrest had the highest risk of mortality (OR = 103.423; P < 0.001), followed by shock (OR = 15.367; P < 0.001), coma (OR = 13.427; P < 0.001), and respiratory failure (OR = 12.051; P < 0.001). Conclusions Our study indicates that the hospitalizations related to POD were more prevalent among females, elders between 51 and 75 years of age, whites, and those in the lower household income quartet. The prevalence of prescription opioid use and the hospitalization related to POD remains a significant public health issue. POD inpatients with medical complications were at a higher risk of mortality than with comorbid SUD.","Sejdiu, Albulena; Pereira, Kristal N; Joundi, Hajara; Patel, Yash R; Basith, Sayeda A; Ayala, Victoria; Mathialagan, Keerthika; Majumder, Pradipta",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8281797/,15

Synthesizing knowledge acquired through experience implementing GHL programs can inform future recommendations for GHL. OBJECTIVE: To describe the lessons learned, highlighting gaps, challenges and opportunities, during implementation of two GHL capacity building programs, namely the Afya Bora Consortium Fellowship in Global Health Leadership and the Sustaining Technical and Analytic Resources (STAR) fellowship and internship program for global health professionals. METHODS: A mixed methods case-comparison study was conducted, using qualitative data (expert opinion) collected from the Program Directors in order to understand the experiences of the two GHL programs. A structured response guide was used to assess the overall experience in GHL program implementation, operational challenges and reported gaps. Afya Bora and STAR have been implemented for 8 and 2.5 years respectively. Thus, the analysis reflects a snapshot of the two programs at different stages. FINDINGS: The results reflect knowledge gained through extensive experience in implementing the two GHL programs. Afya Bora has trained 188 multi-disciplinary fellows, and 100% of the African fellows are engaged in leadership positions in government departments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in their countries. STAR has placed 147 participants (89 fellows and 58 interns) in more than 25 countries globally. Both programs were successful in strengthening south-south and north-south collaborations for a common goal of improving global health. Implementation of both fellowships identified room for improvement in operational procedures and financing of the programs, and highlighted knowledge and skills gaps, as well as challenges in sustainability of the training programs. CONCLUSIONS: Afya Bora and STAR have had significant impact and have contributed to changing the leadership landscape in global health. Future GHL programs should address sustainability in terms of financing, delivery modalities and domestic integration of knowledge.","Voss, Joachim; Yasobant, Sandul; Akridge, Anike; Tarimo, Edith; Seloilwe, Esther; Hausner, David; Mashalla, Yohana",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8284509/,15

The growth forms of plants belonging to the Mimosa genus range from herbs to trees. Several species of this genus play important roles in folk medicine. In this review, we aimed to present the current knowledge of the ethnogeographical distribution, ethnotraditional uses, nutritional values, pharmaceutical potential, and toxicity of the genus Mimosa to facilitate the exploitation of its therapeutic potential for the treatment of human ailments. The present paper consists of a systematic overview of the scientific literature relating to the genus Mimosa published between 1931 and 2020, which was achieved by consulting various databases (Science Direct, Francis and Taylor, Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, SciELO, Web of Science, SciFinder, Wiley, Springer, Google, The Plant Database). More than 160 research articles were included in this review regarding the Mimosa genus. Mimosa species are nutritionally very important and several species are used as feed for different varieties of chickens. Studies regarding their biological potential have shown that species of the Mimosa genus have promising pharmacological properties, including antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic, wound-healing, hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, antinociceptive, antiepileptic, neuropharmacological, toxicological, antiallergic, antihyperurisemic, larvicidal, antiparasitic, molluscicidal, antimutagenic, genotoxic, teratogenic, antispasmolytic, antiviral, and antivenom activities. The findings regarding the genus Mimosa suggest that this genus could be the future of the medicinal industry for the treatment of various diseases, although in the future more research should be carried out to explore its ethnopharmacological, toxicological, and nutritional attributes.","Majeed, Ismat; Rizwan, Komal; Ashar, Ambreen; Rasheed, Tahir; Amarowicz, Ryszard; Kausar, Humaira; Zia-Ul-Haq, Muhammad; Marceanu, Luigi Geo",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8307580/,15

With increasing age and frailty the treatment targets shift away from prolongation of the lifespan to improvement of the quality of life. In this way the preference of home dialysis procedures, also as assisted peritoneal dialysis, can also achieve importance just as specialist nephrological treatment without renal replacement therapy with a palliative treatment target. In advanced age comorbidities, cognitive impairment, frailty and the overall prognosis determine the meaningful approach. Even with the placement of a vascular access there are other criteria for making decisions in very old people with respect to the anastomosis site and timing of access placement. Recommendations on the duration and frequency of dialysis follow the quality of life with incremental and at the end of life also with decremental treatment regimens. The demographic development is a special challenge for nephrology with an increase in older patients. Timely clarification of all renal replacement procedures and establishment of individual treatment targets with a careful selection of the dialysis modality and intensity can make a decisive contribution to improvement of the prognosis and particularly to the quality of life even in the very old.","Bechtel, Ulrike; Abu-Tair, Mariam",Nephrologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8361401/,15

58294,Expression and preliminary characterization of the potential vaccine candidate LipL32 of leptospirosis,2021-09-30,"Femininity and female gender roles in conservative religious environments are highly disputed topics both within communities of faith and in sociological discourse. In light of social transformations of gender perceptions in the past decades, conservative Christians have had to reevaluate traditional understandings of womanhood in societies that have become steeped in popular culture and thoroughly mediatized. Taking this development as a point of departure, this article examines how femininity is represented in the International Christian Fellowship, particularly on its “Ladies Lounge” webpage. Advertising an annual event geared exclusively towards women, the website’s landing page contains images and text that we examine by means of visual and textual sequence analysis. Our research results reveal that women are depicted as sensually attractive and self-confidently professional while at the same time being relegated to an exclusively female sphere within (but not beyond) which they wield authority and influence. As such, femininity is represented as self-empowering, but only within a specific, postfeminist framework. This ambivalent depiction of women’s agency challenges conservative Evangelical values at the same time as it affirms them. In this sense, the study contributes the growing body of literature on gender and Evangelicalism.","Freudenberg, Maren; Sharbat Dar, Dunja",Z Religion Ges Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475442/,15

60239,Comparative clinical study of Bactigras and Telfa AMD for skin graft donor-site dressing.,2011,"INTRODUCTION Informal waste recyclers contribute significantly to waste removal in South Africa. Waste recyclers face health hazards which are associated with handling and disposal of waste, a lack of personal protective wear and inaccessibility to occupational health care services. Consequently, accessing health care within the public health care sector is important for health outcomes in this population. This study assesses health care access of informal waste recyclers in South Africa to establish baseline information for health planning for potential inclusion of informal waste recyclers into occupational health services. METHODS A cross-sectional study of informal waste recyclers in two landfill sites in Johannesburg was conducted from March 2018. A standardized structured questionnaire was used to collect information on sociodemographic details, health care utilization, barriers to access and acceptability and affordability of health care. Factors associated with health care utilization were assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 363 informal waste recyclers were included in the study. Less than half of informal waste recyclers (41.0%) used health care facilities in the last 12 months. Those who accessed services chose to use facilities close to where they live (87.0%). Barriers to accessing health care services included long waiting periods (36.6%), being unable to take time off work (26.3%) and transport problems (13%). In the univariate analysis, factors such as gender and being treated well at the clinic and location of the health care facility were associated with health care utilization (OR: 1.97, p = 0.05, OR: 1.94, p = 0.02, OR: 0.65, p = 0.04 respectively). CONCLUSION Informal waste recyclers face numerous challenges to accessing health care. Specific to their informal trade, barriers to health care utilization are related to financial repercussions due to the informal nature of their work.","Kistan, Jesne; Ntlebi, Vusi; Made, Felix; Kootbodien, Tahira; Wilson, Kerry; Tlotleng, Nonhlanhla; Kgalamono, Spo; Mathee, Angela; Naicker, Nisha",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609735/,15

However, relapsed thrombocytopenia is often observed in patients following PSE. This study aimed to report the clinical efficiency of laparoscopic splenectomy as a salvage treatment for relapsed thrombocytopenia following PSE. METHODS From 2005 to 2009, 6 patients with prior PSE treatment underwent laparoscopic splenectomy. We reviewed the surgical method of laparoscopic splenectomy and the peri- and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS Laparoscopic splenectomy effectively provided sufficient increases in patient platelet counts. In all patients, laparoscopic splenectomy was performed safely with no significant complications despite PSE-associated dense adhesion to the diaphragm and/or retroperitoneal attachments. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic splenectomy provides a sufficient increase in patient platelet counts in relapsed thrombocytopenia following PSE. Therefore, laparoscopic splenectomy appears to be a superior supportive therapy for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in cirrhotic patients.","Hashimoto, Naotaka; Akahoshi, Tomohiko; Tomikawa, Morimasa; Kawanaka, Hirofumi; Konishi, Kozo; Uehara, Hideo; Kinjo, Nao; Korenaga, Daisuke; Takenaka, Kenji; Maehara, Yoshihiko",Digestive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1159/000320331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21196735/,15

METHODS We developed a physical model for the spread of an Ebola-like virus. The scenario involved 3 computerized mannequins. One case was a febrile patient after Ebola exposure. Four residents (group A) had only masks and gloves and were initially unaware of exposure history, whereas 4 residents (group C) had known exposure history and had full PPE present in the room. Infected mannequins and surrounding surfaces were coated with Glo Germ, a UV tracer. Fluorescence to UV light was recorded after each scenario. Both tracer groups were compared with a control group (group B) in which no tracer was used to account for background fluorescence. RESULTS There was transfer of contagion to providers, other patients, nurse and family member confederates, and other treatment rooms. Half of group C used full PPE, and half used partial PPE. There were 3 contaminations in group C with full PPE use, 15 contaminations in group C with partial PPE, and 65 contaminations in group A. CONCLUSIONS The UV tracer seems to be a useful analog of contaminated bodily fluids because it spread easily and its spread decreased with the use of barrier methods. This model could be used in future studies to measure the effectiveness of different forms of PPE and to study the effectiveness of provider education on appropriately donning and doffing PPE.","Drew, Jonathan L; Turner, Joseph; Mugele, Joshua; Hasty, Greg; Duncan, Taylor; Zaiser, Rebekah; Cooper, Dylan",Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,https://doi.org/10.1097/sih.0000000000000157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27043095/,15

METHODS We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies comparing uninterrupted vs interrupted DOAC for patients undergoing CA of AF. Primary outcome was major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included minor bleeding, stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) or thromboembolism (TE), silent cerebral ischemic events and cardiac tamponade. Meta-analysis was stratified by study design. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs were calculated using random effects model and Mantel-Haenszel method was used to pool RR. RESULTS A total of 13 studies (7 randomized, 6 observational) comprising 3595 patients were included. The RCT restricted analysis did not show any difference in terms of major bleeding (RR 0.79 [0.35-1.79]), minor bleeding (RR 0.99 [0.68-1.43]), stroke or TIA or TE (RR 0.80 [0.19-3.32]), silent cerebral ischemic events (RR 0.64 [0.32-1.28]) and cardiac tamponade (RR 0.61 [0.20-1.92]). Observational study restricted analysis showed a protective effect of uninterrupted DOAC on silent cerebral ischemic events (RR 0.45 [0.31-0.67]) and no difference in other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS There is no difference in bleeding and thromboembolic outcomes with uninterrupted vs interrupted DOAC for CA of AF and observational data suggests that uninterrupted DOACs are protective against silent cerebral ischemic lesions.

As of December 6, 2020, the United States of America and India have the highest prevalence. Each country has implemented different strategies to control and reduce the spread of disease. Here, the association between prevalence number and health policies is evaluated by comparing 2 groups of countries: (1) Italy, the United States of America, Germany, Spain, and India with a higher prevalence than a linear trend line; and (2) Singapore and China with a lower or equal prevalence than linear forecasts. A rapid overview revealed that many countries have similar strategies for controlling COVID-19, including the suspension of air travel, the lockdown on the cities with the most cases detected, active case findings, monitoring of close contacts, and raising public awareness. Also, they used a gradual and phased plan to reopen activities. So, the difference between countries in the burden of COVID-19 can be attributable to the strict mode and nonstrict mode of implementation of strategies.

61940,MHC class I A loci polymorphism and diversity in three Southeast Asian populations of cynomolgus macaque.,2009,"As impressive as the accomplishments of modern molecular biologists have been in finding genetic alterations that lengthen life in short-lived model organisms, they pale in comparison to the remarkable diversity of lifespans produced by evolution. Some animal species are now firmly documented to live for more than four centuries and even some mammals, like the bowhead whale, appear to survive 200 years or more. Another group of species may not be as absolutely long-lived, but they are remarkably long-lived for their body size and metabolic rate. These species include a number of bats, some of which live for at least 40 years in the wild, as well as the naked mole-rat, which is the same size, but lives nearly 10 times as long as the laboratory mouse. Together these exceptionally long-lived organisms have important roles to play in our future understanding of the causal mechanisms and modulation of ageing. Bats and naked mole-rats in particular have already contributed in the following ways: (1) they have contributed to the abandonment of the rate-of-living theory and weakened enthusiasm for the oxidative stress hypothesis of ageing, (2) they have helped evaluate how the tumour-suppressing role of cellular senescence is affected by the evolution of diverse body sizes as well as diverse longevities, (3) they have shed light on the relationship between specific types of DNA repair and ageing and (4) they have yielded insight into new processes, specifically the maintenance of the proteome and hypotheses concerning how evolution shapes ageing. The continuing acceleration of progress in genome sequencing and development of more and more cross-species investigatory techniques will facilitate even more contributions of these species in the near future.","Austad, S N",Journal of comparative pathology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2009.10.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19962715/,15
61943,"Is microfluidics the ""assembly line"" for CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing?",2020-11-01,"INTRODUCTION In order to properly evaluate the efficacy of orthopaedic procedures, rigorous, randomised controlled sham surgery trial designs are necessary. However, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for surgery involving a placebo are ethically debated and difficult to conduct with many failing to reach their desired sample size and power. A review of the literature on barriers and enablers to recruitment, and patient and surgeon attitudes and preferences towards sham surgery trials, will help to determine the characteristics necessary for successful recruitment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This review will scope the diverse literature surrounding sham surgery trials with the aim of informing a discrete choice experiment to empirically test patient and surgeon preferences for different sham surgery trial designs. The scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the methodological framework described in Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Protocols extension for Scoping Reviews. The review will be informed by a systematic search of Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL and EconLit databases (from database inception to 21 June 2019), a Google Scholar search, and hand searching of reference lists of relevant studies or reviews. Studies or opinion pieces that involve patient, surgeon or trial characteristics, which influence the decision to participate in a trial, will be included. Study selection will be carried out independently by two authors with discrepancies resolved by consensus among three authors. Data will be charted using a standardised form, and results tabulated and narratively summarised with reference to the research questions of the review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The findings from this review will inform the design of a discrete choice experiment around willingness to participate in surgical trials, the outcomes of which can inform decision and cost-effectiveness models of sham surgery RCTs. The qualitative information from this review will also inform patient-centred outcomes research. The review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

61944,Separation of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid by three-zone simulated moving bed chromatography.,2020-08-16,"Toll-like receptors 7 and 8 (TLR7/8) are transmembrane receptors that recognize single-stranded RNA. Activation of these receptors results in immune cell stimulation and inflammatory cytokine production which is normally a protective host response. However, aberrant activation of TLR7/8 is potentially pathogenic and linked to progression of certain autoimmune diseases such as lupus. Thus, we hypothesize that an inhibitor that blocks TLR7/8 would be an effective therapeutic treatment. Prior efforts to develop inhibitors of TLR7/8 have been largely unsuccessful due to the challenge of producing a small molecule inhibitor for these difficult targets. Here, we report the characterization of M5049 and Compound 2, molecules which were discovered in a medicinal chemistry campaign to produce dual TLR7/8 inhibitors with drug-like properties. Both compounds showed potent and selective activity in a range of cellular assays for inhibition of TLR7/8 and block molecule synthetic ligands and natural endogenous RNA ligands such as microRNA and Alu RNA. M5049 was found to be potent in vivo and TLR7/8 inhibition efficaciously treated disease in several murine lupus models and, interestingly, was efficacious in a disease context where TLR7/8 activity has not previously been considered a primary disease driver. Furthermore, M5049 had greater potency in disease models than expected based on its in vitro potency and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties. With preferential accumulation in tissues, and the ability to block multiple TLR7/8 RNA ligands, M5049 may be efficacious in treating autoimmunity and has the potential to provide benefit to a variety of patients with varying disease pathogenesis. Significance Statement We report discovery of a novel toll-like receptor 7 and 8 (TLR7/8) inhibitor (M5049), characterize its binding mode, potency/selectivity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and demonstrate its potential for treating autoimmune diseases in two mouse lupus models. TLR7/8 inhibition is unique in that it may block both innate and adaptive autoimmunity and thus we believe that M5049 has the potential to benefit patients with autoimmune diseases.","Vlach, Jaromir; Bender, Andrew T; Przetak, Melinda; Pereira, Albertina; Deshpande, Aditee; Johnson, Theresa; Reissig, Sonja; Tzvetkov, Evgeni; Musil, Djordje; Tahmassian-Morse, Noune; Haselmayer, Phillip; Favre-Zimmerli, Simone; Okitsu, Shinji L; Walsky, Robert L; Sherer, Brian",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.120.000275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33328334/,15
62059,The Mechanical Autophagy as a Part of Cellular Immunity; Facts and Features in Treating the Medical Disorders.,2020-09-29,"Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are essential fatty acids for human body, which are widely used in the field of healthy food and medicine. Meanwhile, there are some differences in their physiological functions, such as ""scavenger for blood vessel"" of EPA and ""brain protector"" of DHA. In order to make full use of EPA and DHA, it is necessary to prepare their high-purity component. In this paper, EPA and DHA were separated and purified by three-zone simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography with C18 used as stationary phase and ethanol-water as mobile phase. For the single column experiment, a separation unit of SMB, the effects of the ratio of ethanol to water, pH value and temperature on the separation were investigated. The equilibrium dispersion (ED) model was used to obtain the adsorption parameters of EPA and DHA by inverse method and genetic algorithm, and the accuracy of the adsorption parameters was verified by fitting the overloaded elution curves under different conditions. Based on the acquired nonlinear adsorption isotherms the complete separation region was found according to triangle theory. The effects of sample concentration, flow ratios of adsorption zone and rectification zone, and column distribution mode of SMB on the separation were investigated. Under the optimized SMB conditions, the experimental result was that without regard to the other components, the chromatographic purity and recovery values of EPA and DHA exceeded 99% with the productivity of 4.15 g/L/h, and the solvent consumption of 1.11 L/g.","Wei, Bofeng; Wang, Shaoyan",Journal of chromatography.

62371,Reciprocal priming between receptor tyrosine kinases at recycling endosomes orchestrates cellular signalling outputs.,2021-06-04,"We performed a cost analysis study using decision tree modeling to determine whether the use of multiplex PCR testing for respiratory viruses (xTAG RVP test) is a more or less costly strategy than the status quo testing methods used for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections in pediatric patients. The decision tree model was constructed by using four testing strategies for respiratory virus detection, viz., direct fluorescent-antibody staining (DFA) alone, DFA plus shell vial culture (SVC), the xTAG RVP test alone, or DFA plus the xTAG RVP test. A review of the charts of 661 pediatric patients was used to determine the length of hospital stay, the number of days in isolation, antibiotic usage, and all other medical procedures performed. The cost of hospitalization by diagnostic status was determined on the basis of the average cost per patient and the number of patients in each arm of the decision tree. The cost per case was the highest for DFA plus SVC at $3,914 (in Canadian dollars), and the lowest was for the xTAG RVP test alone at $3,623, while the costs of DFA alone ($3,911) and DFA plus RVP ($3,849) were intermediate. When all four diagnostic strategies were compared, the least costly strategy was the xTAG RVP test alone when the prevalence of infection was 11% or higher and DFA alone when the prevalence was under 11%. These data indicate a savings of $291 per case investigated if the strategy of using the xTAG RVP test alone was used to replace the status quo test of DFA plus SVC, resulting in a savings of $529,620 per year in direct costs for the four Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, hospitals on the basis of the testing of specimens from 1,820 pediatric inpatients. We conclude that the use of the xTAG RVP test is the least costly strategy for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections in children and would generate a significant savings for hospitals.","Mahony, James B; Blackhouse, Gord; Babwah, Jesse; Smieja, Marek; Buracond, Sonya; Chong, Sylvia; Ciccotelli, William; O'Shea, Tim; Alnakhli, Daifallah; Griffiths-Turner, May; Goeree, Ron",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00556-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19571025/,15
62488,Accepting the Torch.,2020,"BACKGROUND Shifts in treatment strategies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have made ambulatory care more labour-intensive. These developments have prompted innovative care models, including mobile health (mHealth) applications. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of mHealth-inexperienced stakeholders concerning these applications in RA care. METHODS We performed a qualitative study by focus group interviews of stakeholders including RA patients, nurses specialised in RA care and rheumatologists. The qualitative analysis guide of Leuven (QUAGOL), which is based on grounded theory principles, was used to thematically analyse the data. In addition, the Persuasive Systems Design (PSD) model was used to structure recommended app-features. RESULTS In total, 2 focus groups with nurses (total n = 16), 2 with patients (n = 17) and 2 with rheumatologists (n = 25) took place. Six overarching themes emerged from the analysis. Efficiency of care and enabling patient empowerment were the two themes considered as expected benefits of mHealth-use in practice by the stakeholders. In contrast, 4 themes emerged as possible barriers of mHealth-use: the burden of chronic app-use, motivational aspects, target group aspects, and legal and organisational requirements. Additionally, recommendations for an ideal mHealth-app could be structured into 4 domains (Primary Task Support, Dialogue Support, Social Support and System Credibility) according to the PSD-framework. Most recommended features were related to improving ease of use (Task Support) and System Credibility. CONCLUSIONS Although mHealth-apps were expected to improve care efficiency and stimulate patient empowerment, stakeholders were concerned that mHealth-app use could reinforce negative illness behaviour. For mHealth-apps to be successful in practice, challenges according to stakeholders were avoiding long-term poor compliance, finding the target audience and tailoring a legal and organisational framework. Finally, the ideal mHealth-application should above all be trustworthy and easy to use.","Doumen, Michaël; Westhovens, René; Pazmino, Sofia; Bertrand, Delphine; Stouten, Veerle; Neys, Claudia; Creten, Nelly; Van Laeken, Els; Verschueren, Patrick; De Cock, Diederik",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-021-04624-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34461875/,15

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 156 patients were diagnosed with ectopic pregnancies by ultrasonography and serum β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) levels at Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital from January 2009 through December 2013. We excluded 28 patients who only received medical treatment, 15 patients who underwent surgery by laparotomy for severe hypovolemic shock, and 30 patients who presented with less than 1 L of hemoperitoneum. Of the 83 patients with massive hemoperitoneum, 38 patients had LESS performed while the remaining 45 patients underwent conventional laparoscopic surgery. RESULTS In this study, there were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes in either surgical method except for operative time. Operative time of LESS was significantly shorter than conventional surgery for patients with more than 500 mL of hemoperitoneum. CONCLUSION LESS is a safe and feasible surgical approach in the treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy. At the same time, LESS has been shown to be more effective than conventional laparoscopic surgery in handling massive hemoperitoneum of more than 1 L, which is a common complication of ectopic pregnancy.","Yang, Juseok; Na, Yong Jin; Song, Yong Jung; Choi, Ook Hwan; Lee, Sun Kyung; Kim, Hwi Gon",Taiwanese journal of obstetrics & gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjog.2015.02.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26927245/,15

There is a major effort underway to develop antithrombotic drugs that have a smaller impact on hemostasis. The plasma contact proteins factor XI (FXI) and factor XII (FXII) have drawn considerable interest because they contribute to thrombosis but have limited roles in hemostasis. Here, we discuss results of preclinical and clinical trials supporting the hypothesis that the contact system contributes to thromboembolic disease. RECENT FINDINGS Numerous compounds targeting FXI or FXII have shown antithrombotic properties in preclinical studies. In phase 2 studies, drugs-targeting FXI or its protease form FXIa compared favorably with standard care for venous thrombosis prophylaxis in patients undergoing knee replacement. While less work has been done with FXII inhibitors, they may be particularly useful for limiting thrombosis in situations where blood comes into contact with artificial surfaces of medical devices. SUMMARY Inhibitors of contact activation, and particularly of FXI, are showing promise for prevention of thromboembolic disease. Larger studies are required to establish their efficacy, and to establish that they are safer than current therapy from a bleeding standpoint.","Srivastava, Priyanka; Gailani, David",Current opinion in hematology,https://doi.org/10.1097/moh.0000000000000603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32740037/,15

Both mechanical properties and flow reduction effects are important factors in the design of an optimal stent. OBJECTIVE We aimed to clarify the contributions of strut size and pitch to the mechanical properties (radial stiffness and longitudinal flexibility) and geometric characteristics (porosity and pore density) related to flow reduction effects. METHODS Crimping and bending behaviors of the stents were simulated with the finite element method. The relationships between the mechanical properties and geometric characteristics were investigated by changing the strut size and pitch. RESULTS Within the porosity range of 79-82%, the radial stiffness of the stent was similarly influenced by either the strut size or pitch. However, the longitudinal flexibility tended to be influenced more by strut size than by pitch. CONCLUSIONS Adjusting the strut size rather than the pitch can change the mechanical properties while minimizing the change in porosity or pore density related to flow reduction effects.","Suzuki, Takashi; Takao, Hiroyuki; Fujimura, Soichiro; Dahmani, Chihebeddine; Ishibashi, Toshihiro; Mamori, Hiroya; Fukushima, Naoya; Murayama, Yuichi; Yamamoto, Makoto",Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine,https://doi.org/10.3233/thc-160535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28506004/,15

65624,Macroglial diversity: white and grey areas and relevance to remyelination.,2020-07-09,"Recent studies have shown enhanced tumor targeting by novel somatostatin receptor (SSTR) antagonists compared with clinically widely used agonists. However, these results have been obtained mostly in neuroendocrine tumors, and only limited data are available for cancer types with lower SSTR expression, including breast cancer (BC). To date, two studies have reported higher binding of the antagonist than the agonist in BC, but in both studies only a limited number of cases were evaluated. In this preclinical study, we further investigated whether the application of an SSTR antagonist can improve SSTR-mediated BC imaging in a large panel of BC specimens. We also generated an in vivo BC mouse model and performed SPECT/MRI and biodistribution studies. Methods: Binding of 111In-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate (SSTR agonist) and 111In-DOTA-JR11 (SSTR antagonist) to 40 human BC specimens was compared using in vitro autoradiography. SSTR2 immunostaining was performed to confirm SSTR2 expression of the tumor cells. Furthermore, binding of the radiolabeled SSTR agonist and antagonist was analyzed in tissue material from 6 patient-derived xenografts. One patient-derived xenograft, the estrogen receptor-positive model T126, was chosen to generate in vivo mouse models containing orthotopic breast tumors for in vivo SPECT/MRI and biodistribution studies after injection with 177Lu-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate or 177Lu-DOTA-JR11. Results:111In-DOTA-JR11 binding to human BC tissue was significantly higher than 111In-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate binding (P < 0.001). The median ratio of antagonist binding versus agonist binding was 3.39 (interquartile range, 2-5). SSTR2 immunostaining confirmed SSTR2 expression on the tumor cells. SPECT/MRI of the mouse model found better tumor visualization with the antagonist. This result was in line with the significantly higher tumor uptake of the radiolabeled antagonist than of the agonist as measured in biodistribution studies 285 min after radiotracer injection (percentage injected dose per gram of tissue: 1.92 ± 0.43 vs. 0.90 ± 0.17; P = 0.002).

66043,Translating viral vaccines into immunity.,2021-01-29,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS In Great Britain, cannabis and tobacco are commonly used substances, both independently and together. Use of either substance is associated with mental health problems, but prevalence of co-use within these populations is unknown. We aimed to 1) estimate prevalence of cannabis use, frequency of use and routes of administration (ROA) among tobacco smokers and non-smokers and 2) investigate mental health problems amongst non-users, tobacco-only, cannabis-only and co-users of both substances. DESIGN Cross-sectional national online survey (Action on Smoking and Health) fielded in February-March 2020. SETTING Great Britain PARTICIPANTS: Adults in Great Britain aged ≥ 18 year (n = 12,809) MEASUREMENTS: Tobacco use status (smoker [daily or non-daily] or non-smoker [never or ex-smoker]), cannabis use frequency (never to daily), detailed ROAs of cannabis, self-reported treatment for mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, and any). Statistically weighted prevalence estimates were computed to ensure representativeness. Correlates were assessed using chi-squared tests and logistic regression. FINDINGS In Great Britain in 2020, 7.1% of the sample had used cannabis in the past year. Tobacco smokers had greater odds of using cannabis in the past year (21.9%) and using cannabis daily (8.7%) than non-smokers (past-year: 4.7%; aOR=10.07, [95% CI: 8.4-12.0]; daily: 0.7%; aOR=24.6, [95% CI: 17.96-35.55]). Co-administration with tobacco was common (46.2% of non-smokers, 80.8% of tobacco smokers). Co-users reported the highest prevalence of any treatment for mental health problems (54.2%) in comparison to cannabis-only (45.8%), tobacco-only (33.2%) and non-users (22.7%; all p≤0.05). CONCLUSION Approximately one in 13 adults in Great Britain reports having used cannabis in the past year, approximately four times as many among cigarette smokers as non-smokers. Co-administration of cannabis and tobacco, via smoking, appears to be common, including among self-identified non-smokers.

METHODS The authors performed a single-center retrospective case-control study. The outcome of interest was seizure associated with DBS implantation. Univariate analyses were performed using the Student t-test for parametric continuous outcomes. The authors used the Kruskal-Wallis test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for nonparametric continuous outcomes, chi-square statistics for categorical outcomes, and multivariate logistic regression for binomial variables. RESULTS A total of 814 DBS electrode implantations were performed in 645 patients (478 [58.7%] in men and 520 [63.9%] in patients with Parkinson's disease). In total, 22 (3.4%) patients who had undergone 23 (2.8%) placements experienced seizure. Of the 23 DBS implantation-related seizures, 21 were new-onset seizures (3.3% of 645 patients) and 2 were recurrence or worsening of a prior seizure disorder. Among the 23 cases with postimplantation-related seizure, epilepsy developed in 4 (17.4%) postoperatively; the risk of DBS-associated epilepsy was 0.50% per DBS electrode placement and 0.63% per patient. Nine (39.1%) implantation-related seizures had associated postoperative radiographic abnormalities. Multivariate analyses suggested that age at surgery conferred a modest increased risk for postoperative seizures (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10). Sex, primary diagnosis, electrode location and sidedness, and the number of trajectories were not significantly associated with seizures after DBS surgery. CONCLUSIONS Seizures associated with DBS electrode placement are uncommon, typically occur early within the postoperative period, and seldom lead to epilepsy. This study suggests that patient characteristics, such as age, may play a greater role than perioperative variables in determining seizure risk. Multiinstitutional studies may help better define and mitigate the risk of seizures after DBS surgery.","Atchley, Travis J; Elsayed, Galal A; Sowers, Blake; Walker, Harrison C; Chagoya, Gustavo; Davis, Matthew C; Bernstock, Joshua D; Omar, Nidal B; Patel, Daxa M; Guthrie, Barton L",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.5.jns20125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764176/,15

Tocilizumab has shown promising results in retrospective studies in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with a good safety profile. Objective To evaluate the effect of early tocilizumab administration vs standard therapy in preventing clinical worsening in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial that randomized patients hospitalized between March 31 and June 11, 2020, with COVID-19 pneumonia to receive tocilizumab or standard of care in 24 hospitals in Italy. Cases of COVID-19 were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction method with nasopharyngeal swab. Eligibility criteria included COVID-19 pneumonia documented by radiologic imaging, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (Pao2/Fio2) ratio between 200 and 300 mm Hg, and an inflammatory phenotype defined by fever and elevated C-reactive protein. Interventions Patients in the experimental arm received intravenous tocilizumab within 8 hours from randomization (8 mg/kg up to a maximum of 800 mg), followed by a second dose after 12 hours. Patients in the control arm received supportive care following the protocols of each clinical center until clinical worsening and then could receive tocilizumab as a rescue therapy. Main Outcome and Measures The primary composite outcome was defined as entry into the intensive care unit with invasive mechanical ventilation, death from all causes, or clinical aggravation documented by the finding of a Pao2/Fio2 ratio less than 150 mm Hg, whichever came first. Results A total of 126 patients were randomized (60 to the tocilizumab group; 66 to the control group). The median (interquartile range) age was 60.0 (53.0-72.0) years, and the majority of patients were male (77 of 126, 61.1%). Three patients withdrew from the study, leaving 123 patients available for the intention-to-treat analyses. Seventeen patients of 60 (28.3%) in the tocilizumab arm and 17 of 63 (27.0%) in the standard care group showed clinical worsening within 14 days since randomization (rate ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.59-1.86). Two patients in the experimental group and 1 in the control group died before 30 days from randomization, and 6 and 5 patients were intubated in the 2 groups, respectively. The trial was prematurely interrupted after an interim analysis for futility. Conclusions and Relevance In this randomized clinical trial of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and Pao2/Fio2 ratio between 200 and 300 mm Hg who received tocilizumab, no benefit on disease progression was observed compared with standard care. Further blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the results and to evaluate possible applications of tocilizumab in different stages of the disease.

69111,Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on Hysterectomy by Vaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (vNOTES) Compared to Laparoscopic Hysterectomy for Benign Indications.,2020-12-07,"Viscoelastic coagulation monitor (VCM) is a portable device developed to evaluate the viscoelastic properties of whole blood activated by contact with glass. In this study, VCM was employed to analyze the viscoelastic profiles of 36 COVID-19 intensive care patients. Full anticoagulant dose heparin (unfractionated [UFH]; low molecular weight [LMWH]) was administrated to all patients. The association between VCM and laboratory parameters was retrospectively analyzed. The administration of UFH-influenced VCM parameters prolonging clotting time (CT) and clot formation time (CFT) and reducing angle (alpha) and amplitudes of the VCM tracings (A10, A20, and maximum clot firmness [MCF]) compared with LMWH therapy. A tendency toward hypercoagulation was observed by short CT and CFT in patients receiving LMWH. Clotting time was correlated with UFH dose (Spearman's rho = 0.48, p ≤ 0.001), and no correlation was found between CT and LMWH. All VCM tracings failed to show lysis at 30 and 45 minutes, indicating the absence of fibrinolysis. A10, A20, and MCF exhibited very-good to good diagnostic accuracy for detecting platelet count and fibrinogen above the upper reference limit of the laboratory. In conclusion, VCM provided reliable results in COVID-19 patients and was easy to perform with minimal training at the bedside.","Panigada, Mauro; Meli, Andrea; Scotti, Eleonora; Properzi, Paolo; Brioni, Matteo; Kamel, Shady; Ghirardello, Stefano; Scudeller, Luigia; Dalton, Heidi J; Grasselli, Giacomo",ASAIO journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000001380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33627598/,15
69617,"Concentration and chemical form of dietary zinc shape the porcine colon microbiome, its functional capacity and antibiotic resistance gene repertoire.",2020-08-03,"Few studies focused on the effects of iron on characterizing alterations of metabolic processes in neonatal piglets. In the present study, 16 neonatal piglets were randomly assigned to two groups. In the first group piglets were given an intramuscularly injection of iron dextran at 150 mg as a positive control (CON) and the second group were not supplemented with iron as a negative control for iron deficiency (ID). At day 8, iron status, serum biochemical parameters, serum metabolome, hepatic histology, and hepatic expression of genes for the metabolism were analyzed. Results indicated that piglets without iron supplementation had significantly reduced iron values and increased blood urea nitrogen concentrations at day 8 (p < 0.05). Analysis of serum metabolome revealed that concentrations of serum lysine, leucine, tyrosine, methionine, and cholesterol were significantly decreased while concentrations of 3-Methyldioxyindole, chenodeoxycholate acid, indoleacetic acid, icosadienoic acid, phenylpyruvic acid, pantothenic acid, ursocholic acid, and cholic acid were significantly increased in iron deficient piglets (p < 0.05). Furthermore, expressions of cyp7a1 and the urea cycle enzyme (ornithinetranscarbamoylase and argininosuccinate synthetase) were significantly increased in iron deficient pigs (p < 0.05). The present experimental results indicated that neonatal piglets without iron supplementation drop to borderline anemia within 8 days after birth. Iron deficiency led to a series of metabolic changes involved in tyrosine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, bile secretion, primary bile acid biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis, and upregulated activities of the urea cycle enzymes in the liver of neonatal piglets, suggesting early effects on metabolic health of neonatal piglets.","Dong, Zhenglin; Wan, Dan; Yang, Huansheng; Li, Guanya; Zhang, Yiming; Zhou, Xihong; Wu, Xin; Yin, Yulong",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10081353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764239/,15
69679,Advances in imaging of understudied ions in signaling: A focus on magnesium.,2020-05-11,"OBJECTIVES Endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke with a large vessel occlusion was recently shown to be effective. We aimed to develop a score capable of predicting large vessel occlusion eligible for endovascular treatment in the early hospital management. DESIGN Retrospective, cohort study. SETTING Two tertiary, Swiss stroke centers. PATIENTS Consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients (1,645 patients; Acute STroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne registry), who had CT angiography within 6 and 12 hours of symptom onset, were categorized according to the occlusion site. Demographic and clinical information was used in logistic regression analysis to derive predictors of large vessel occlusion (defined as intracranial carotid, basilar, and M1 segment of middle cerebral artery occlusions). Based on logistic regression coefficients, an integer score was created and validated internally and externally (848 patients; Bernese Stroke Registry). INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Large vessel occlusions were present in 316 patients (21%) in the derivation and 566 (28%) in the external validation cohort. Five predictors added significantly to the score: National Institute of Health Stroke Scale at admission, hemineglect, female sex, atrial fibrillation, and no history of stroke and prestroke handicap (modified Rankin Scale score, < 2). Diagnostic accuracy in internal and external validation cohorts was excellent (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.84 both). The score performed slightly better than National Institute of Health Stroke Scale alone regarding prediction error (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.001) and regarding discriminatory power in derivation and pooled cohorts (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.81 vs 0.80; DeLong test, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Our score accurately predicts the presence of emergent large vessel occlusions, which are eligible for endovascular treatment. However, incorporation of additional demographic and historical information available on hospital arrival provides minimal incremental predictive value compared with the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale alone.","Vanacker, Peter; Heldner, Mirjam R; Amiguet, Michael; Faouzi, Mohamed; Cras, Patrick; Ntaios, George; Arnold, Marcel; Mattle, Heinrich P; Gralla, Jan; Fischer, Urs; Michel, Patrik",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000001630; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26958750/,15
70019,Secukinumab effective for nr-axSpA.,2020-08-25,"The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has resulted in unprecedented job losses, disrupting health insurance coverage for millions of Americans. Several models predict large increases in Medicaid enrollment among those who have lost jobs, yet the number of Americans who have gained coverage since the pandemic is unknown. We compile early Medicaid enrollment reports covering the period of March 1 through June 1, 2020 for 26 states. We find that, in these 26 states, Medicaid has covered over an additional 1.7 million Americans in roughly a three-month period. Relative changes in Medicaid enrollment differed significantly across states although enrollment growth was not systemically related to job losses. Our results point to the importance of state policy differences in the response to COVID-19.

70584,Polymeric nanostructure vaccines: applications and challenges.,2020-05-30,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Zhizhu Xiang (ZZX for short) is the root and rhizome of Valeriana jatamansi Jones, which is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) used to treat various mood disorders for more than 2,000 years, especially anxiety. However, there have been few investigations to clarify the compounds in ZZX for the treatment of anxiety. AIM OF THE STUDY Our previous study has identified five anti-anxiety components, including hesperidin, isochlorogenic acid A, isochlorogenic acid B and isochlorogenic acid C and chlorogenic acid, from extract of ZZX. In order to find the optimal combination and the underlying mechanism of these five components in the treatment of anxiety disorder, researches were designed based on uniform design method and proteomic technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS The samples with different proportion and content of the five active components were arranged by uniform design method. Then a mathematical model was formulated using partial least square method and stepwise regression analysis. Moreover, the empty bottle stress-induced anxiety rat model was established, and the anti-anxiety effect was recorded by the unconditioned reflex elevated maze test and the open field test. In addition, the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technique, along with the multidimensional liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry were applied in proteomic study. At last, the result of proteomic analysis was further confirmed by Western blot. RESULTS The optimal combination of the components from the extract of ZZX was 1.153 mg/kg hesperidin, 2.197 mg/kg Isochlorogenic acid A, 0.699 mg/kg Isochlorogenic acid B and 1.249 mg/kg Chlorogenic acid. Total 6818 proteins were identified using proteomic analysis and 80 differentially expressed proteins were used for further bioinformatic analysis. These proteins were involved in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, protein digestion and absorption, cholesterol metabolism, Chagas disease, and AGE/RAGE signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS The composition and proportion of anti-anxiety components in extract of ZZX was disclosed, and there was an anti-anxiety effect for the combined components of flavonoids and phenolic acids. Through proteomic analysis and Western blot, it was found that the effective components of extract of ZZX can exert synergistic anti-anxiety effects via the regulation of multi-signaling pathways. These findings could provide a preliminary research basis for the development of new low-toxic, efficient, stable and controllable anti-anxiety drugs.","Wang, Shao-Nan; Yao, Zi-Wei; Zhao, Cheng-Bowen; Ding, Yong-Sheng; Jing-Luo,; Bian, Li-Hua; Li, Qiu-Yu; Wang, Xiao-Mei; Shi, Jin-Li; Guo, Jian-You; Wang, Chun-Guo",Journal of ethnopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.113452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069789/,15

71985,Tunicamycin induced endoplasmic reticulum stress in the small intestine.,2020-09-23,"Importance Cognitive behavioral therapy is recommended for anxiety-related disorders, but evidence for its long-term outcome is limited. Objective This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the long-term outcomes after cognitive behavioral therapy (compared with care as usual, relaxation, psychoeducation, pill placebo, supportive therapy, or waiting list) for anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Data Sources English-language publications were identified from PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane, OpenGrey (1980 to January 2019), and recent reviews. The search strategy included a combination of terms associated with anxiety disorders (eg, panic or phobi*) and study design (eg, clinical trial or randomized controlled trial). Study Selection Randomized clinical trials on posttreatment and at least 1-month follow-up effects of cognitive behavioral therapy compared with control conditions among adults with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, PTSD, or OCD. Data Extraction and Synthesis Researchers independently screened records, extracted statistics, and assessed study quality. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Main Outcomes and Measures Hedges g was calculated for anxiety symptoms immediately after treatment and at 1 to 6 months, 6 to 12 months, and more than 12 months after treatment completion. Results Of 69 randomized clinical trials (4118 outpatients) that were mainly of low quality, cognitive behavioral therapy compared with control conditions was associated with improved outcomes after treatment completion and at 1 to 6 months and at 6 to 12 months of follow-up for a generalized anxiety disorder (Hedges g, 0.07-0.40), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (Hedges g, 0.22-0.35), social anxiety disorder (Hedges g, 0.34-0.60), specific phobia (Hedges g, 0.49-0.72), PTSD (Hedges g, 0.59-0.72), and OCD (Hedges g, 0.70-0.85). After 12-month follow-up, these associations were still significant for generalized anxiety disorder (Hedges g, 0.22; number of studies [k] = 10), social anxiety disorder (Hedges g, 0.42; k = 3), and PTSD (Hedges g, 0.84; k = 5), but not for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (k = 5) and could not be calculated for specific phobia (k = 1) and OCD (k = 0). Relapse rates after 3 to 12 months were 0% to 14% but were reported in only 6 randomized clinical trials (predominantly for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia). Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety-related disorders is associated with improved outcomes compared with control conditions until 12 months after treatment completion. After 12 months, effects were small to medium for generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder, large for PTSD, and not significant or not available for other disorders. High-quality randomized clinical trials with more than 12 months of follow-up and reported relapse rates are needed.","van Dis, Eva A M; van Veen, Suzanne C; Hagenaars, Muriel A; Batelaan, Neeltje M; Bockting, Claudi L H; van den Heuvel, Rinske M; Cuijpers, Pim; Engelhard, Iris M",JAMA psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.3986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31758858/,15

72524,Kinship analysis on single cells after whole genome amplification.,2020-09-04,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO) has become an established technique within the domain of acute care surgery. As minimally invasive management of SBO becomes more widely accepted, there is increased need for reporting of outcomes. OBJECTIVE To compare outcomes of laparoscopic versus open surgery for adhesive SBO. METHODS Patients undergoing surgery for adhesive SBO at our institution between 2005 and 2013 were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was overall complication rate, while secondary outcomes included operative time, gastrointestinal (GI) function, and postoperative length of stay (LOS). Univariable analysis compared laparoscopic (including conversions) and open groups with regard to patient baseline and perioperative characteristics as well as outcomes of interest. Multivariable analysis was performed comparing the endpoint of overall complications between groups. Sensitivity analysis excluding patients who underwent bowel resection was performed to assess effect on outcomes. Factors associated with laparoscopic success, as well as impact of conversion to open on postoperative outcomes, are reported. RESULTS A cohort of 269 patients with adhesive SBO was identified: 186 patients (69.1%) underwent open surgery, 83 (30.9%) were managed laparoscopically. Within the laparoscopy group, 32 (38.6%) underwent conversion to open. Operative time was similar between groups (P = 0.506), while laparoscopy was associated with quicker recovery of GI function indicated by removal of nasogastric tube (P = 0.031) and passage of flatus (P = 0.005). Postoperative LOS was shorter (5 vs. 7 days, P = 0.031) with laparoscopy. The overall complication rate was significantly lower in the laparoscopic group (27.7 vs. 43.6%, P = 0.014), with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for overall complications of 0.37 (P = 0.002). Following exclusion of bowel resections, secondary outcomes continued to favor laparoscopy, while reduction in overall complications trended toward significance, OR 0.47 (P = 0.050). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic surgical management of adhesive SBO was associated quicker GI recovery, shorter LOS, and reduced overall complications compared to open surgery.","Byrne, James; Saleh, Fady; Ambrosini, Luciano; Quereshy, Fayez; Jackson, Timothy D; Okrainec, Allan",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-4015-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25480627/,15

A literature search on dry eye and COVID-19 was performed. Most current studies focus on DED in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 or dry eye symptoms in random populations of students and medical staff. Real-world dry eye practices revealed a variety of responses, possibly related to local environmental factors and lifestyle. Patients recovered from COVID-19 warrant ocular surface surveillance for DED. Pandemic mitigation strategies including remote work/school/leisure and mask wearing affect dry eye practices globally. Heightened reiteration of dry eye management for environmental and behavioral modifications, visual display terminals, and mask wearing with attention to its effects on the ocular surface is increasingly important as this pandemic continues.","Koh, Shizuka; Rhee, Michelle K",Eye & contact lens,https://doi.org/10.1097/icl.0000000000000797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33990103/,15

73304,Understanding Molecular Mechanism of Biologics Drug Delivery and Stability from NMR Spectroscopy.,2021-02-17,"The relationship between bats and coronaviruses (CoVs) has received considerable attention since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like CoV was identified in the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophidae) in 2005. Since then, several bats throughout the world have been shown to shed CoV sequences, and presumably CoVs, in the feces; however, no bat CoVs have been isolated from nature. Moreover, there are very few bat cell lines or reagents available for investigating CoV replication in bat cells or for isolating bat CoVs adapted to specific bat species. Here, we show by molecular clock analysis that alphacoronavirus (α-CoV) sequences derived from the North American tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) are predicted to share common ancestry with human CoV (HCoV)-NL63, with the most recent common ancestor between these viruses occurring approximately 563 to 822 years ago. Further, we developed immortalized bat cell lines from the lungs of this bat species to determine if these cells were capable of supporting infection with HCoVs. While SARS-CoV, mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15), and chimeric SARS-CoVs bearing the spike genes of early human strains replicated inefficiently, HCoV-NL63 replicated for multiple passages in the immortalized lung cells from this bat species. These observations support the hypothesis that human CoVs are capable of establishing zoonotic-reverse zoonotic transmission cycles that may allow some CoVs to readily circulate and exchange genetic material between strains found in bats and other mammals, including humans.","Huynh, Jeremy; Li, Shimena; Yount, Boyd; Smith, Alexander; Sturges, Leslie; Olsen, John C; Nagel, Juliet; Johnson, Joshua B; Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Gates, J Edward; Frieman, Matthew B; Baric, Ralph S; Donaldson, Eric F",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00906-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22993147/,15
73776,Approaches for the discovery of new cell-penetrating peptides.,2021-05-01,"Cancer chemotherapy has been used since the early 1950s and still remains one the major therapeutic options for many malignant tumours. A major obstacle to successful cancer chemotherapy is drug resistance. Frequently resistance is intrinsic to the cancer, but as therapy becomes more effective, acquired resistance has also become more frequent. One form of resistance, named multidrug resistance (MDR), is responsible for the failure of tumours to respond to a wide spectrum of chemotherapeutic agents. The in vivo monitoring of MDR could assist in the selection of patients for therapy and can avoid ineffective and potentially toxic treatments. Therefore, methods for functionally interrogating MDR transport activity have been sought, namely single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). Cationic radiotracers originally developed as SPECT myocardial imaging agents, such as [(99m)Tc(MIBI)(6)](+) and [(99m)Tc(tetrofosmin)(2)O(2)](+), are used for both early cancer detection and non-invasive monitoring of the tumour MDR transport function. With the ultimate goal of obtaining better performing radioprobes for MDR imaging, other metal-based complexes and/or small molecules have also been synthesized and biologically evaluated. In this perspective we will report on the chemical efforts made to find metalloprobes for in vivo monitoring of MDR by nuclear imaging techniques. The current knowledge on the biological mechanisms and proteins involved in tumour MDR will be also briefly presented, as its understanding is invaluable for the rational design and biological evaluation of new radioprobes.","Mendes, Filipa; Paulo, António; Santos, Isabel",Dalton transactions,https://doi.org/10.1039/c0dt01275k; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21384018/,15

74256,Presenting porous-organic-polymers as next-generation invigorating materials for nanoreactors.,2021-08-09,"Targeting early infection in mucosal sites is one of the primary goals for mucosal vaccines so as to prevent pathogen mucosal transmission and infection. The TLR5 agonist flagellin was deemed to be a mucosal adjuvant candidate for clinical usage. However, the high antigenicity of flagellin and the possible inflammatory injury induced by flagellin might restrict its clinical usage. Here HIV-1 p24 protein was selected as an antigen model and we replaced the main antigenicity region domains D2 and D3 of non-pathogenic E.coli-derived flagellin (KF). The derived soluble protein KFD-p24 3D was then compared with KF-p24, which fused p24 directly to the C-terminal of KF. In vitro and ex vivo experiments showed that KFD-p24 3D has lower TLR5 agonist efficacy and less immunocyte-activating efficacy. Interestingly, the production of KF- specific antibody was highly reduced, and KFD-p24 3D induced IgA-biased antibody responses in mucosal sites. Moreover, KFD-p24 3D induced far fewer systemic inflammatory responses and abrogated detectable inflammatory side effects on mice, even at the high dose. The properties of enhanced IgA generation and attenuated inflammatory responses broaden the safe-dose range of KFD-p24 3D flagellin, creating a potentially promising mucosal adjuvant.","Yang, Jingyi; Zhong, Maohua; Zhang, Yan; Zhang, Ejuan; Sun, Ying; Cao, Yuan; Li, Yaoming; Zhou, Dihan; He, Benxia; Chen, Yaoqing; Yang, Yi; Yu, Jie; Yan, Huimin",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.23809; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23377752/,15

Home oximetry evaluated overnight oxygen desaturation (ODI) throughout treatment. RESULTS 16 subjects aged 57[51-61] years (median [interquartile range]) with body mass index 30[26-36] kg/m2 completed the study. Reb-oxy lowered AHI from 49[35-57] events/h at baseline to 18[13-21] events/h (59% median reduction) compared with 39[29-48] events/h (6% median reduction) on placebo (p<0.001). Response rate for reb-oxy was 81% versus 13% for placebo p<0.001). Although ESS was not significantly lowered, PVT median reaction time decreased from 250[239-312] ms on baseline to 223[172-244] ms on reb-oxy versus 264[217-284] ms on placebo (p<0.001). Home oximetry illustrated acute and sustained improvement in ODI on reb-oxy versus placebo. INTERPRETATION The administration of reboxetine-plus-oxybutynin greatly decreased OSA severity and increased vigilance. These results highlight potential possibilities for pharmacological treatment of OSA.","Perger, Elisa; Montemurro, Luigi Taranto; Rosa, Debora; Vicini, Stefano; Marconi, Mariapaola; Zanotti, Lucia; Meriggi, Paolo; Azarbarzin, Ali; Sands, Scott A; Wellman, Andrew; Lombardi, Carolina; Parati, Gianfranco",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.08.080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34543665/,15
74649,Sciatic Nerve Cut and Repair Using Fibrin Glue in Adult Mice.,2019-09-20,"Objective: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak that began in China has turned into a pandemic that threatens global health, thereby prompting the concentration of studies and clinical routines on treating and preventing the disease. However, research on the psychological effects of the pandemic on the general population, particularly pregnant women, is lacking. Accordingly, the present study investigated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression and anxiety in pregnant women.Study design: An anonymous survey for assessing depression and anxiety in pregnant women was designed, after which a link to the online questionnaire was sent to the participants, who were being treated in a private medical center. One of the researchers followed up with the respondents, among whom 260 returned their questionnaires.Results: Among the respondents, 35.4% (n = 92, case group) obtained scores higher than 13 on the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). The comparison of the groups by years of education indicated statistically significant effects of COVID-19 on psychology, social isolation, and mean scores in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). These effects were more severe in the case group than in the control group (psychology: 8.369 ± 2.003, social isolation: 8.000 ± 2.507, mean BDI and BAI scores: 20.565 ± 6.605 and 22.087 ± 8.689, respectively). A regression analysis revealed that the BDI scores and the disease's psychological effects, as well as the BAI scores and the illness's social isolation effects, exerted a statistically significant influence on the EPDS scores of the participants.Conclusion: This study illustrated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the depression and anxiety levels of pregnant women. Our results point to an urgent need to provide psychosocial support to this population during the crisis. Otherwise, adverse events may occur during pregnancy and thus affect both mother and fetus.","Durankuş, Ferit; Aksu, Erson","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1763946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419558/,15

However, the effect of metformin during ischemic brain injury is unclear. The aim of the present study is to explore the effect of metformin during ischemic brain injury. Adult male CD1 mice underwent 90min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Metformin (200mg/kg) was given at the time of reperfusion daily until sacrifice. Results showed that metformin treatment significantly reduced ischemia-induced brain atrophy volume compared to the control (p<0.05). Immunostaining results showed that the microvessel density in the peri-focal region of metformin treated mice was greatly increased compared to the control (p<0.05). Similarly, the numbers of BrdU+/DCX+ and nestin+ cells in the subventricular zone were increased in metformin treated mice compared to the control (p<0.05). Furthermore, we demonstrated that metformin treatment activated AMPK signaling pathway and promoted eNOS phosphorylation. Thus, we concluded that metformin promoted focal angiogenesis and neurogenesis and attenuated ischemia-induced brain injury in mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion, suggesting that metformin is a potential new drug for ischemic stroke therapy.","Liu, Yanqun; Tang, Guanghui; Zhang, Zhijun; Wang, Yongting; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Neuroscience letters,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2014.07.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25026071/,15

Therefore, the study aimed to compare the effect of endurance and endurance-strength training on body composition and cardiometabolic parameters in abdominally obese women. In this randomised trial, 101 subjects were included and divided into endurance (n = 52) and endurance-strength (n = 49) training. During the 12-week intervention, participants performed supervised one-hour training three times a week. Body composition, blood pressure (BP), markers of glucose and lipid homeostasis, and myoglobin levels were measured before and after the intervention. In total, 85 subjects completed the trial. Both interventions decreased fat mass and visceral adipose tissue and increased free fat mass, appendicular lean mass index and lean mass index. Neither endurance training nor endurance-strength training affected glucose and lipid metabolism. However, only endurance training significantly decreased paraoxonase and myoglobin levels. Both training programmes significantly decreased BP, with a more reduction of diastolic BP noted in the endurance group. In conclusion, both training programmes had a favourable effect on body composition but did not improve glucose and lipid homeostasis. Besides, endurance training decreased paraoxonase activity and myoglobin levels and was more effective in reducing BP.The study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) within the number: DRKS00019832 (retrospective registration), date of registration: 26/02/2020.","Jamka, Małgorzata; Mądry, Edyta; Krzyżanowska-Jankowska, Patrycja; Skrypnik, Damian; Szulińska, Monika; Mądry, Radosław; Lisowska, Aleksandra; Batyrova, Gulnara; Duś-Żuchowska, Monika; Gotz-Więckowska, Anna; Bogdański, Paweł; Walkowiak, Jarosław",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90526-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117276/,15

Using rat models of embolic and transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (eMCAO and tMCAO), we investigated the effect on stroke outcomes of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from rat cerebral endothelial cells (CEC-sEVs) in combination with tPA (CEC-sEVs/tPA) as a treatment of eMCAO and tMCAO in rat. The effect of sEVs derived from clots acquired from patients who had undergone mechanical thrombectomy on healthy human CEC permeability was also evaluated. CEC-sEVs/tPA administered 4 h after eMCAO reduced infarct volume by ∼36%, increased recanalization of the occluded MCA, enhanced cerebral blood flow (CBF), and reduced blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage. Treatment with CEC-sEVs given upon reperfusion after 2 h tMCAO significantly reduced infarct volume by ∼43%, and neurological outcomes were improved in both CEC-sEVs treated models. CEC-sEVs/tPA reduced a network of microRNAs (miRs) and proteins that mediate thrombosis, coagulation, and inflammation. Patient-clot derived sEVs increased CEC permeability, which was reduced by CEC-sEVs. CEC-sEV mediated suppression of a network of pro-thrombotic, -coagulant, and -inflammatory miRs and proteins likely contribute to therapeutic effects. Thus, CEC-sEVs have a therapeutic effect on acute ischemic stroke by reducing neurovascular damage.","Li, Chao; Wang, Chunyang; Zhang, Yi; Alsrouji, Owais K; Chebl, Alex B; Ding, Guangliang; Jiang, Quan; Mayer, Stephan A; Lu, Mei; Kole, Max K; Marin, Horia L; Zhang, Li; Chopp, Michael; Zhang, Zheng Gang",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678x21992980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33557693/,15

In this ongoing pandemic, public health concerns and the urgent need for effective therapeutic measures require a deep understanding of its epidemiology, transmissibility and pathogenesis. Here we analyzed the clinical, molecular and immunological data from 326 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shanghai. Genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 assembled from 112 quality samples together with sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) showed a stable evolution and suggested two major lineages with differential exposure history during the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan. Nevertheless, they exhibited similar virulence and clinical outcomes. Lymphocytopenia, especially the reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts upon admission, was predictive of disease progression. High levels of IL-6 and IL-8 during treatment were observed in patients with severe or critical disease and correlated with decreased lymphocyte count. The determinants of disease severity seemed to stem mostly from host factors such as age, lymphocytopenia, and its associated cytokine storm, whereas viral genetic variation did not significantly affect the outcomes.","Zhang, Xiaonan; Tan, Yun; Ling, Yun; Lu, Gang; Liu, Feng; Yi, Zhigang; Jia, Xiaofang; Wu, Min; Shi, Bisheng; Xu, Shuibao; Chen, Jun; Wang, Wei; Chen, Bing; Jiang, Lu; Yu, Shuting; Lu, Jing; Wang, Jinzeng; Xu, Mingzhu; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhang, Qin; Zhang, Xinxin; Zhao, Guoping; Wang, Shengyue; Chen, Saijuan; Lu, Hongzhou",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2355-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434211/,15

Our primary aim was to compare HRQoL of 3 illness groups of outpatient adults: those with diabetes, those who survived a hospitalization for COVID-19, and those who had a respiratory virus not COVID-19. The secondary aim was to compare the group domain summary scores to the referent general population. METHODS We identified the 3 groups from the electronic medical record and invited them to complete the SF-36 survey. Analysis of variance and post hoc testing was used for univariate analyses followed by linear regression. RESULTS One hundred thirty-two adults completed the survey. The groups differed least for physical functioning and most for emotional/mental health. The hospitalized group had the greatest limitation in role due to emotional issues. All groups had significantly lower social functioning scores than the general population. Linear regression showed lower HRQoL domain score in role limitations due to emotional issues adjusted for age, race, and gender for the hospitalized group. CONCLUSION SF-36 scores show the decrease in HRQoL that outpatient adults have suffered, mostly in the emotional domain, regardless of illness group during the COVID-19 pandemic.","O'Dwyer, Marie Claire; Meixner, Kate; Albiac, Laura Crespo; El Khoury, Christelle; Capizzano, J Nicoll; Ramakrishnan, Manasi; Salada, Cullen; Furst, Wendy; Haro, Elizabeth; Alves, Martha; Sen, Ananda; Harper, Diane M",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.03.200593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34088811/,15

When it comes to managing the under-resourced health systems of developing countries, information-based decision making is particularly important. This paper reports findings of a self-report survey that investigated perceptions of local health managers (HMs) of their own regional HIS in Sri Lanka. Data were collected through a validated, pre-tested postal questionnaire, and distributed among a selected group of HMs to elicit their perceptions of the current HIS in relation to information generation, acquisition and use, required reforms to the information system and application of information and communication technology (ICT). Results based on descriptive statistics indicated that the regional HIS was poorly organised and in need of reform; that management support for the system was unsatisfactory in terms of relevance, accuracy, timeliness and accessibility; that political pressure and community and donor requests took precedence over vital health information when management decisions were made; and use of ICT was unsatisfactory. HIS strengths included user-friendly paper formats, a centralised planning system and an efficient disease notification system; weaknesses were lack of comprehensiveness, inaccuracy, and lack of a feedback system. Responses of participants indicated that HIS would be improved by adopting an internationally accepted framework and introducing ICT applications. Perceived barriers to such improvements were high initial cost of educating staff to improve computer literacy, introduction of ICTS, and HIS restructure. We concluded that the regional HIS of Central Province, Sri Lanka had failed to provide much-needed information support to HMS. These findings are consistent with similar research in other developing countries and reinforce the need for further research to verify causes of poor performance and to design strategic reforms to improve HIS in regional Sri Lanka.","Ranasinghe, Kaduruwane Indika; Chan, Taizan; Yaralagadda, Prasad",Health information management : journal of the Health Information Management Association of Australia,https://doi.org/10.1177/183335831204100303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28683688/,15

CaW has been associated with recurrent strokes and conventionally treated with surgical excision. We report a multicenter experience of stenting in patients with symptomatic CaWs. Methods Retrospective review of consecutive patients admitted to 5 comprehensive stroke centers who were identified to have a symptomatic CaW and treated with carotid stenting. A symptomatic CaW was defined by the presence of a shelf-like/linear, smooth filling defect in the posterior aspect of the carotid bulb diagnosed by neck CT angiography (CTA) and confirmed with conventional angiography in patients with negative stroke workup. Results Twenty-four patients with stented symptomatic CaW were identified (stroke in 83% and transient ischemic attack in 17%). Their median age was 47 years (IQR 41-61), 14 (58%) were female, and were 17 (71%) black. The degree of stenosis by NASCET was 0% (range 0-11). All patients were placed on dual antiplatelets and stented at a median of 9 days (IQR 4-35) after the last event. Closed-cell stents were used in 18 (75%) of the cases. No periprocedural events occurred with the exception of 2 cases of asymptomatic hypotension/bradycardia. Clinical follow-up after stent placement occurred for a median of 12 months (IQR 3-19) with no new cerebrovascular events noted. Functional independence at 90 days was achieved in 22 (91%) patients. Follow-up vascular imaging (ultrasound n = 18/CTA n = 5) was performed at a median of 10 months (IQR 3-18) and revealed no stenosis. Conclusions Stenting for symptomatic CaW appears to be a safe and effective alternative to surgical resection.

This study sought to evaluate whether there is any difference on the long-term results of TAR and non-TAR CABG patients. METHODS The Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL/CCTR), Clinical Trials.gov, Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS), and Google Scholar databases were searched for studies published by October 2020. Randomized clinical trials and observational studies with propensity score matching comparing TAR versus non-TAR CABG were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. The current barriers to implementation of TAR in clinical practice and measures that can be used to optimize outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Fourteen publications (from 2012 to 2020) involving a total of 22,746 patients (TAR: 8,941 patients; non-TAR: 13,805 patients) were included. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) for long-term mortality (over 10 years) was lower in the TAR group than in the non-TAR group (random effect model: HR 0.676, 95% confidence interval 0.586-0.779, P<0.001). There was evidence of low heterogeneity of treatment effect among the studies for mortality, and none of the studies had a particular impact on the summary result. The result was not influenced by age, sex, or comorbidities. We identified low risk of publication bias related to this outcome. CONCLUSION This review found that TAR presents the best long-term results in patients who undergo CABG. Given that many patients are likely to benefit from TAR, its use should be encouraged.","Rayol, Sérgio C; Eynde, Jef Van den; Cavalcanti, Luiz Rafael P; Escorel, Antonio Carlos; Rad, Arian Arjomandi; Amabile, Andrea; Botelho, Wilson; Ruhparwar, Arjang; Zhigalov, Konstantin; Weymann, Alexander; Sobral, Dario Celestino; Sá, Michel Pompeu B O",Brazilian journal of cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.21470/1678-9741-2020-0653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594864/,15
77849,Evolving Role of Urologists in the Management of Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.,2020-08-01,"INTRODUCTION Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a chronic disease affecting the heart valves, secondary to group A streptococcal infection (GAS) and subsequent acute rheumatic fever (ARF). However, RHD cure and preventative measures are inextricably linked with socioeconomic development, as the disease mainly affects children and young adults living in poverty. In order to address RHD, public health officials and health policymakers require up-to-date knowledge on the epidemiology of GAS, ARF and RHD, as well as the existing enablers and gaps in delivery of evidence-based care for these conditions. We propose to conduct a systematic review to assess the literature comprehensively, synthesising all existing quantitative and qualitative data relating to RHD in Africa. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We plan to conduct a comprehensive literature search using a number of databases and reference lists of relevant articles published from January 1995 to December 2015. Two evaluators will independently review and extract data from each article. Additionally, we will assess overall study quality and risk of bias, using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria for quantitative and qualitative studies, respectively. We will meta-analyse estimates of prevalence, incidence, case fatality and mortality for each of the conditions separately for each country. Qualitative meta-analysis will be conducted for facilitators and barriers in RHD health access. Lastly, we will create a list of key stakeholders. This protocol is registered in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of systematic reviews, registration number CRD42016032852. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The information provided by this review will inform and assist relevant stakeholders in identifying key areas of intervention, and designing and implementing evidence-based programmes and policies at the local and regional level. With slight modifications (ie, to the country terms in the search strategy), this protocol can be used as part of a needs assessment in any endemic country.","Moloi, Annesinah Hlengiwe; Watkins, David; Engel, Mark E; Mall, Sumaya; Zühlke, Liesl",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27207627/,15

METHODS 28 burn patients received surgical treatment with split-thickness skin grafting, while utilizing Biobrane(®), Dressilk(®) and PolyMem(®) as a single bound donor site wound dressing in all patients. Following a standardized case report form, we monitored several parameters such as pain, transparency of the dressing, active bleeding, exudation and inflammation by using the Verbal Rating Scale 1-10 through out. RESULTS With regard to re-epithelialization, pain and acute bleeding all three dressings were equivalent. Dressilk(®) and Biobrane(®) presented clearly superior to PolyMem(®) in both wound assessment and in the reduction of mild inflammation and exudation. High subjective satisfaction rates were reported with Dressilk(®) and Biobrane(®) dressings in regard to comfort and mobility. During the continuous monitoring period Biobrane(®) outperformed Dressilk(®) by providing higher wound transparency rates and offering a better level of wound control during the entire study period. Regarding their cost efficiency, PolyMem(®) and Dressilk(®) are clearly superior to Biobrane(®). CONCLUSION The ""ideal"" wound dressing maximizes patients' comfort while reducing pain and the risk of pulling off migrating epidermal cells from the wound surface. In addition reliable wound status evaluation (minimizing complications), an increase of treatment cost value efficacy, and reduced hospitalization rates should be provided. Dressilk(®) and Biobrane(®) were favored by patients and surgeons for providing an effective and safe healing environment, with overall low complication rates with respect to infection and exudation. Regarding cost-effectiveness PolyMem(®) and Dressilk(®) presented superior to Biobrane(®).","Schulz, Alexandra; Depner, Christian; Lefering, Rolf; Kricheldorff, Julian; Kästner, Sonja; Fuchs, Paul Christian; Demir, Erhan",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.burns.2014.12.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25720659/,15

This problem emerged in Lombardy, the Italian region where the pandemic exacted the heaviest toll. Study aims were to assess mental health of HW in Lombardy after the peak of COVID-19 related hospitalizations, through the joint evaluation of PTSD and positive mental health; and to explore the potential role of positive mental health in PTSD development. METHODS HW completed an online survey including demographic and work-related information; PTSD Checklist for DSM-5; Mental Health Continuum Short-Form. Analyses comprised calculation of percentages of participants meeting a provisional PTSD and mental health diagnosis (flourishing, moderate, languishing); a binary logistic regression with demographics, work-related features, and positive mental health as predictors, and provisional PTSD diagnosis as outcome. RESULTS Out of 653 participants, 39.8% received a provisional PTSD diagnosis; 33.4% reported flourishing, 57.7% moderate, and 8.9% languishing mental health. Regression analysis highlighted that women vs. men, nurses vs. technical/rehabilitation HW, frontline vs. second-line workers and languishing vs. moderately mentally healthy HW were more likely to receive a provisional PTSD diagnosis, whereas flourishing participants were more likely not to receive it. No role emerged for job seniority. LIMITATIONS Self-reported PTSD scores, stress symptoms related to COVID-19 considered as a global stressor, cross-sectional study design.

Monitoring biomarker responses to training may inform changes in training load to optimize performance. OBJECTIVE This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify biomarkers associated with altered exercise performance following intensified training. METHODS Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus and SPORTDiscus were searched up until September 2017. Included articles were peer reviewed and reported on biomarkers collected at rest in well-trained male athletes before and after periods of intensified training. RESULTS The full text of 161 articles was reviewed, with 59 included (708 participants) and 42 (550 participants) meta-analysed. In total, 118 biomarkers were evaluated, with most being cellular communication and immunity markers (n = 54). Studies most frequently measured cortisol (n = 34), creatine kinase (n = 25) and testosterone (n = 20). Many studies reported decreased immune cell counts following intensified training, irrespective of performance. Moreover, reduced performance was associated with a decrease in neutrophils (d = - 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) - 1.07 to - 0.07) and glutamine (d = - 0.37; 95% CI - 0.43 to - 0.31) and an increase in urea concentration (d = 0.80; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.30). In contrast, increased performance was associated with an increased testosterone:cortisol ratio (d = 0.89; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.24). All remaining biomarkers showed no consistent patterns of change with performance. CONCLUSIONS Many biomarkers were altered with intensified training but not in a manner related to changes in exercise performance. Neutrophils, glutamine, urea and the testosterone:cortisol ratio exhibited some evidence of directional changes that corresponded with performance changes therefore indicating potential to track performance. Additional investigations of the potential for these markers to track altered performance are warranted.","Greenham, Grace; Buckley, Jonathan D; Garrett, Joel; Eston, Roger; Norton, Kevin",Sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-018-0969-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30141022/,15

We evaluated the psychometric properties and feasibility of using a computerized version of the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) in an epidemiological study in rural Kenya. Methods: We surveyed 1496 participants aged 13-24 years in Kilifi County, on the Kenyan coast. The MDI was administered using a computer-assisted system, available in three languages. Internal consistency was evaluated using both Cronbach's alpha and the Omega Coefficient. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to evaluate the factorial structure of the MDI. Results: Internal consistency using both Cronbach's Alpha (α= 0.83) and the Omega Coefficient (0.82; 95% confidence interval 0.81- 0.83) was above acceptable thresholds. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good fit of the data to a unidimensional model of MDI (χ 2 (33, N = 1409) = 178.52 p < 0.001, TLI = 0.947, CFI = 0.961, and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation, RMSEA = .056), and this was confirmed using Item Response Models (Loevinger's H coefficient 0.38) that proved the MDI was a unidimensional scale. Equivalence evaluation indicated invariance across sex and age groups. In our population, 3.6% of the youth presented with scores suggesting major depression using the ICD-10 scoring algorithm, and 8.7% presented with total scores indicating presence of depression (mild, moderate or severe). Females and older youth were at the highest risk of depression. Conclusions: The MDI has good psychometric properties. Given its brevity, relative ease of usage and ability to identify at-risk youth, it may be useful for epidemiological studies of depression in Africa. Studies to establish clinical thresholds for depression are recommended. The high prevalence of depressive symptoms suggests that depression may be an important public health problem in this population group.","Otiende, Mark; Abubakar, Amina; Mochamah, George; Walumbe, David; Nyundo, Christopher; Doyle, Aoife M; Ross, David A; Newton, Charles R; Bauni, Evasius",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.12620.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29862324/,15
78602,Capillary cell-type specialization in the alveolus.,2020-10-14,"The appropriate arrangement of myonuclei within skeletal muscle myofibers is of critical importance for normal muscle function, and improper myonuclear localization has been linked to a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, such as centronuclear myopathy and muscular dystrophies. However, the molecules that govern myonuclear positioning remain elusive. Here, we report that skeletal muscle-specific CIP (sk-CIP) is a regulator of nuclear positioning. Genetic deletion of sk-CIP in mice results in misalignment of myonuclei along the myofibers and at specialized structures such as neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and myotendinous junctions (MTJs) in vivo, impairing myonuclear positioning after muscle regeneration, leading to severe muscle dystrophy in mdx mice, a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. sk-CIP is localized to the centrosome in myoblasts and relocates to the outer nuclear envelope in myotubes upon differentiation. Mechanistically, we found that sk-CIP interacts with the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex and the centriole Microtubule Organizing Center (MTOC) proteins to coordinately modulate myonuclear positioning and alignment. These findings indicate that sk-CIP may function as a muscle-specific anchoring protein to regulate nuclear position in multinucleated muscle cells.","Liu, Jianming; Huang, Zhan-Peng; Nie, Mao; Wang, Gang; Silva, William J; Yang, Qiumei; Freire, Paula P; Hu, Xiaoyun; Chen, Huaqun; Deng, Zhongliang; Pu, William T; Wang, Da-Zhi",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1922911117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719146/,15

Methods A systematic literature review covering the years 1966‒2017 (February) was undertaken to capture both published and gray literature studies of OSH work environment interventions with quantitative measures of intervention effects. Studies that met specified in- and exclusion criteria went through an assessment of methodological quality. Included studies were grouped into five thematic domains: (i) introduction of OHS legislation, (ii) inspection/enforcement activity, (iii) training, such as improving knowledge, (iv), campaigns, and (v) introduction of technical device, such as mechanical lifting aids. The evidence synthesis was based on meta-analysis and a modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results The search for peer-reviewed literature identified 14 743 journal articles of which 45 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were eligible for meta-analysis. We identified 5181 articles and reports in the gray literature, of which 16 were evaluated qualitatively. There was moderately strong evidence for improvement by OHS legislation and inspections with respect to injuries and compliance. Conclusions This review indicates that legislative and regulatory policy may reduce injuries and fatalities and improve compliance with OHS regulation. A major research gap was identified with respect to the effects of OSH regulation targeting psychological and musculoskeletal disorders.","Andersen, Johan Hviid; Malmros, Per; Ebbehoej, Niels Erik; Flachs, Esben Meulengracht; Bengtsen, Elizabeth; Bonde, Jens Peter","Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",https://doi.org/10.5271/sjweh.3775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30370910/,15

The fastidious causative pathogen, Avibacterium paragallinarum, is difficult to recover and identify, resulting in delayed diagnosis and enhanced spread of the agent. Small poultry flocks are increasingly common in rural and suburban environments. We assessed the frequency of A. paragallinarum using real-time PCR and clinical conditions present in samples from such flocks submitted to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System (Davis, CA) in 2018. From the 294 samples collected for our study, 86 (30%) were PCR-positive for A. paragallinarum. Juvenile birds (≤1 y) were significantly more likely to be PCR-positive ( p = 0.017), and birds diagnosed with respiratory disease had lower Ct values ( p = 0.001) than those without. Concurrent infections were also identified, including with Mycoplasma gallisepticum (18.6%), M. synoviae (18.6%), infectious bronchitis virus (12.8%), and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (7.0%). Only 46.5% of PCR-positive chickens had antemortem respiratory signs, making endemic infections in these flocks highly likely. Our study demonstrates that A. paragallinarum is present in small-flock operations including those without respiratory disease and may present a risk for airborne pathogen transmission to commercial poultry operations.","Clothier, Kristin A; Torain, Andrea; Reinl, Steve","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638719844297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30973083/,15
79683,"Flaviviridae Replication Organelles: Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave.",2015,"OBJECTIVES To investigate the impact of the SAR-Cov-2 pandemic and lockdown on individuals with bipolar disorder in comparison to healthy controls. METHODS A longitudinal study of 560 participants including 147 healthy controls was conducted between April 30 and May 30, 2020 during a state-wide lockdown. Bi-weekly measures included the Coronavirus Impact Scale, the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, the Patient Health Questionnaire, 9-item, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, 7-item. Generalized estimating equations method was used to examine the longitudinal change of the measures within the lockdown and the change from pre-pandemic period to pandemic period. RESULTS All participants reported an impact of lockdown. Individuals with bipolar disorder reported greater impact from the stay-at-home orders with disruptions in routines, income/employment, social support and pandemic related stress. While these measures improved over time, healthy controls recovered quicker and with greater magnitude than persons with bipolar disorder. Comparing mood symptom severity measures in mid-March through May 2020 to the same time window in 2015-2019 (pre- verses post-pandemic), there were no significant differences among individuals with bipolar disorder, whereas healthy controls showed a significant, albeit transient, increase in mood symptoms. CONCLUSION Everyone was impacted by the SARs-CoV pandemic; however, those with bipolar disorder experienced more life impacting changes from the stay-at-home orders vs healthy controls. These disruptions improved over time but much more slowly than healthy controls. Pre- vs post-pandemic comparisons show a modest but significant increase in mood severity in the healthy controls which was not observed in those with bipolar disorder.","Yocum, Anastasia K; Zhai, Yuqi; McInnis, Melvin G; Han, Peisong",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33601700/,15

The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the barbed auto-locking absorbable suture for the closure of an anastomotic stapler-access enterotomy during a totally laparoscopic right colectomy. METHODS From January 2010 to April 2016, data from patients who had undergone a laparoscopic right colectomy in 2 different departments of 2 institutions (the Department of General and Minimally Invasive Surgery, San Camillo Hospital in Trento and the Department of Surgical Specialties and Nephrology, University Federico II in Naples) were retrospectively analyzed. We compared the data of patients in whom the stapler-access enterotomy was closed through a conventional absorbable suture (Group A), with the data of patients in whom a stapler-access enterotomy was closed through a V-Loc 180 suture (Group B). Biometric features and intraoperative and postoperative data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS The 2 groups (Group A: 40 patients; Group B: 40 patients) were comparable for biometric features and postoperative outcomes. The anastomosing time was lower in Group B. A statistically significant difference was noted in the mean operative time between Groups A and B (Group A = 134.92 ± 34.17; Group B = 120.92 ± 23.27, P = .035). Only one anastomotic leakage per group was recorded, each treated with an anastomosis redo. During the reoperations, we find in both groups an intact stapler-access enterotomy. CONCLUSION On retrospective analysis, barbed suture appears to be safe and efficient for closure of the stapler-access enterotomy during totally laparoscopic right colectomy.","Bracale, Umberto; Merola, Giovanni; Cabras, Francesco; Andreuccetti, Jacopo; Corcione, Francesco; Pignata, Giusto",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350618765871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29577831/,15

There is still no agreed consensus on the optimal surgical approach. Since the turn of the twenty-first century, minimally invasive techniques have gained in popularity as they combine the advantages of limited abdominal wall dissection, reduced post-operative pain and risk of complications, and shorter hospital stay. Although the added cost incurred by using sophisticated laparoscopic instruments may be quite substantial, it is precisely counterbalanced by an improved morbidity rate, faster discharge home and time to return to work. Laparoscopic abdominal wall hernia repair is often challenging, as it requires good anatomical knowledge, eye-hand coordination and diversified laparoscopic skills. The objective of this article is not to present another set of personal data and to compare it with already published results on this matter, but simply to offer comprehensive guidelines on the practical aspects of this relatively new technique. Some of these steps have already been discussed but most of the time in a scattered way in the surgical literature, while others are the fruit of a personal expertise grasped over the years.","Berney, Christophe R",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-015-0080-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26282676/,15

We assessed the impact of burnout on performing a visual task with varying memory loads, and on involuntary attention switch to distractor sounds using scalp recordings of event-related potentials (ERPs). Task performance was comparable between burnout and control groups. The distractor sounds elicited a P3a response, which was reduced in the burnout group. This suggests burnout-related deficits in processing novel and potentially important events during task performance. In the burnout group, we also observed a decrease in working-memory related P3b responses over posterior scalp and increase over frontal areas. These results suggest that burnout is associated with deficits in cognitive control needed to monitor and update information in working memory. Successful task performance in burnout might require additional recruitment of anterior regions to compensate the decrement in posterior activity.","Sokka, Laura; Leinikka, Marianne; Korpela, Jussi; Henelius, Andreas; Ahonen, Lauri; Alain, Claude; Alho, Kimmo; Huotilainen, Minna",Biological psychology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2016.02.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26926255/,15

Methods Data for all ACF influenza outbreaks in NSW in 2017 were extracted from the Notifiable Conditions Information Management System. The numbers of outbreaks, residents with influenza-like illness (ILI), hospital admissions and deaths were assessed. For each outbreak the attack rate; duration; timeliness of notification; resident and staff influenza vaccination coverage; and antiviral use for treatment or prophylaxis were analysed. Data were considered for NSW in total and separately for seven of the state's local health districts. Data completeness was assessed for all available variables. Results A total of 538 ACF outbreaks resulted in 7,613 residents with ILI, 793 hospitalisations and 338 deaths. NSW outbreaks had a median attack rate of 17% and median duration of eight days. Data completeness, which varied considerably between districts, limited the capacity to accurately consider some important epidemiological and policy issues. Discussion Influenza outbreaks impose a major burden on the residents and staff of ACFs. Accurate assessment of the year-to-year incidence and severity of influenza outbreaks in these facilities is important for monitoring the effectiveness of outbreak prevention and management strategies. Some key data were incomplete and strategies to improve the quality of these data are needed, particularly for: the number of influenza-related deaths among residents; resident and staff vaccination coverage prior to outbreaks; and recorded use of antiviral prophylaxis.","Merritt, Tony D; Dalton, Craig B; Kakar, Sheena R; Ferson, Mark J; Stanley, Priscilla; Gilmour, Robin E",Communicable diseases intelligence,https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2021.45.22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33934695/,15

The aim of this study was to investigate ACE2 gene expression in skin using a public database. METHODS A search of transcriptomic data sets from a public gene expression database to investigate ACE2 gene expression in human tissues. RESULTS Human skin keratinocytes and basal cells express more ACE2 than lung epithelial cells. In contrast, both fibroblasts and melanocytes from human skin express less ACE2 than human lung epithelial cells.

82910,Nucleic acid vaccination strategies against infectious diseases.,2015,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Globally, since the outbreak, more than seven million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported. The rapid spread and increase in the number of new cases is due to person-to-person transmission. To further control its transmission, early laboratory diagnosis of both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients is crucial. Presently, the COVID-19 diagnosis of infected individuals is dependent on computed tomography scanning and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The latter is considered more sensitive and efficient for early diagnosis. In this review, general comparisons are made (cases, fatality rate, incubation period, clinical features, and reservoirs) and diagnostic laboratory procedures (specimens, extraction methods, and positive rates by real-time PCR) are compared between SARS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and SARS-2. In total, 8982 SARS-2 suspected patients specimen data were retrieved, in which 40.9% (n = 3678) were detected as positive by real-time PCR. The specimen-wise high detection rate was observed from bronchoalveolar lavage, followed by saliva, nasal swabs, and sputum.

The underlying cause(s) remain incompletely understood. In this study, in patients with an influenza A/H1N1 virus infection, viral load and platelet count correlated inversely during the acute infection phase. We confirmed this finding in a ferret model of influenza virus infection. In these animals, platelet count decreased with the degree of virus pathogenicity varying from 0% in animals infected with the influenza A/H3N2 virus, to 22% in those with the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus, up to 62% in animals with a highly pathogenic A/H5N1 virus infection. This thrombocytopenia is associated with virus-containing platelets that circulate in the blood. Uptake of influenza virus particles by platelets requires binding to sialoglycans and results in the removal of sialic acids by the virus neuraminidase, a trigger for hepatic clearance of platelets. We propose the clearance of influenza virus by platelets as a paradigm. These insights clarify the pathophysiology of influenza virus infection and show how severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19, may propagate thrombocytopenia and/or thromboembolic complications.","Jansen, A J Gerard; Spaan, Thom; Low, Hui Zhi; Di Iorio, Daniele; van den Brand, Judith; Tieke, Malte; Barendrecht, Arjan; Rohn, Kerstin; van Amerongen, Geert; Stittelaar, Koert; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang; Osterhaus, Albert; Kuiken, Thijs; Boons, Geert-Jan; Huskens, Jurriaan; Boes, Marianne; Maas, Coen; van der Vries, Erhard",Blood advances,https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609845/,15

Three types of doubly strapped TADAPs were prepared as nickel(II) complexes using meso-N-(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)-substituted TADAP and the corresponding aliphatic diacids as precursors. Theoretical calculations revealed that regardless of their oxidation states, all strapped TADAPs had essentially flat π-planes. It was found that the alkyl-chain straps slightly affected the optical and electrochemical properties of the DAP rings, particularly in the oxidized forms. 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to evaluate the antiaromatic character of the 20π TADAPs and the aromatic character of the 18π TADAP dications, and it was observed that they displayed paratropic and diatropic ring-current effects, respectively, on the chemical shifts of methylene protons in the spatially separated alkyl chains. The degree of shielding and deshielding depended on the position of the methylene units; it decreased with increase in separation from the π-plane and central axis of the porphyrin ring. The NMR experiments also revealed that the degree of the diatropic ring currents was clearly related to the π-electron density of the porphyrin ring; the ring-current effects decreased as the charge increased from 0 to +2. These findings are also qualitatively supported by the nucleus-independent chemical shifts.","Ochiai, Hikari; Furukawa, Ko; Nakano, Haruyuki; Matano, Yoshihiro",The Journal of organic chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.0c02433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411514/,15
84656,Low RNA translation activit limits the efficacy of hydrodynamic gene transfer to pig liver in vivo.,2014,"C-Mannosyl tryptophan (C-Man-Trp) is a unique glycosylated amino acid present in various eukaryotes. The C-Man-Trp structure can be found as a monomeric form or a part of post-translational modifications within polypeptide chains in living organisms. However, the mechanism of how monomeric C-Man-Trp is produced has not been fully investigated. In this study, we assessed levels of cellular C-Man-Trp by ultra performance liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry assay system, and investigated whether the cellular C-Man-Trp is affected by autophagy induction. The intracellular C-Man-Trp level was significantly increased under serum and/or amino acid starvation in A549, HaCaT, HepG2, NIH3T3, and NRK49F cells. The increase in C-Man-Trp was also observed in NIH3T3 cells treated with rapamycin, an autophagy inducer. The up-regulation of C-Man-Trp caused by starvation was reversed by the inhibition of lysosomal enzymes. We further showed that C-Man-Trp is produced by incubating a synthetic C-mannosylated peptide (C-Man-Trp-Ser-Pro-Trp) or thrombospondin (TSP) in a lysosomal fraction that was prepared from a mouse liver, which provides supporting evidence that C-Man-Trp is a degradation product of the C-mannosylated peptide or protein following lysosome-related proteolysis. Taken together, we propose that the autophagic pathway is a novel pathway that at least partly contributes to intracellular C-Man-Trp production under certain conditions, such as nutrient starvation.","Minakata, Shiho; Inai, Yoko; Manabe, Shino; Nishitsuji, Kazuchika; Ito, Yukishige; Ihara, Yoshito",Glycoconjugate journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10719-020-09938-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803368/,15

AREAS COVERED This article addresses the Evaluation of Ertugliflozin Efficacy and Safety Cardiovascular Outcomes (VERTIS-CV) trial, its background, design, results, and implications. In patients at least 40 years of age with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the VERTIS-CV trial demonstrated ertugliflozin was non-inferior to placebo for major adverse cardiovascular events, though not superior. Ertugliflozin significantly reduced hospitalization for heart failure compared to placebo. The composite renal outcome was not significantly different between groups. Ertugliflozin was generally well tolerated with a safety profile commensurate with other sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2) inhibitors. EXPERT OPINION In patients with type 2 diabetes and ASCVD, ertugliflozin appears safe with a noted non-significant trend toward improved renal outcomes. Approximately 23.7% of patients in the VERTIS-CV trial had heart failure, the highest among SGLT-2 inhibitor CVOTs.

In this study, we utilize both physical and mathematical models to investigate the roles of soil geology heterogeneities and impermeable surface pavements in determining the attenuation of contaminant soil gas concentration. The results indicate that the attenuation of soil gas concentration with lateral diffusion is observed to be the most significant if with a low-permeability soil layer at the bottom and a high-permeability layer on top, followed by the cases with the uniform soil properties, and the lateral attenuation is the least significant in cases with a high-permeability soil layer at the bottom and a low-permeability soil layer on top, regardless of the surface coverage. Compared to soil heterogeneity, the influences of surface conditions are less significant, and the capping effect of surface cover can only play a role in determining shallow soil gas concentration profiles. At last, the physical experimental results were used to examine a previously developed analytical vapor intrusion model including the influences of layering and surface conditions.","Wang, Genfu; Xiao, Yuting; Zuo, Jianping; Wang, Yue; Man, Jun; Tang, Wei; Chen, Qiang; Ma, Shuaishuai; Yao, Yijun",Journal of contaminant hydrology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2020.103712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942141/,15

In the present study, we described the rapid implementation of the telemedicine in pediatrics during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and explored its value in response to the demand for pediatric medical services during the epidemic. Methods An Internet-based platform for multidisciplinary online medical consultation was established on February 8, 2020, by a national children's medical center in China. The medical data of the traditional hospital visits and novel online visits from the first two months (February 8 to March 31) after the establishment of the platform were collected and analyzed. The demographic features, changes in the disease spectrum and characteristics of online medical services were described. Results The total number of visits was significantly lower (by 75.3%) than that of in the same period in the previous year. The disease spectrum was different with a significant decrease of >95% in the number of patients with infectious or contagious diseases. The online visits accounted for 14.7% of all visits. Online patients came from all over the country, covering 91% of the administrative regions of China, and the largest proportion of inquiries were for infants (33.7%) (P<0.01). The response rate of experts to requests for online consultations was 100%. During the study period, 266 experts from 25 pediatric specialties completed 12,318 effective consultations, proving different degrees of online supplementation for various specialties (4.3-168.4%). Online consultations mainly addressed two types of problems: (I) accessibility of the traditional hospital visits and (II) consultations regarding an illness. Data from pediatric nephrology showed that 96% of the patients with stable chronic kidney disease successfully received follow-up medication adjustment guidance through the online platform. Conclusions The traditional hospital medical services have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The multidisciplinary online medical consultation system is a strategy to actively respond to the medical needs of children during unique periods.","Zhai, Yihui; Ge, Xiaoling; Liu, Xiaoxiong; Xie, Li; Shen, Qian; Ye, Chengjie; Shen, Zhen; Chen, Jie; Xu, Hong; Zhang, Xiaobo",Translational pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.21037/tp-20-348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33850814/,15

This case-control study included 15 intrauterine growth restricted fetuses and 20 age-matched controls. During delivery of the fetuses, cord blood and maternal blood S100 and IMA levels were studied. The fetal weight and umbilical cord pH values of IUGR fetuses were significantly lower than the control group. The mean maternal and umbilical cord blood values of S100 and IMA were similar in the two groups. IMA levels in cord blood of the IUGR group were significantly higher than maternal levels, whereas umbilical and maternal levels of IMA did not differ among control cases.

86924,Biased agonism at β-adrenergic receptors.,2020-12-29,"Poor air quality is an emerging problem in Australia primarily due to ozone pollution events and lengthening and more severe wildfire seasons. A significant deterioration in air quality was experienced in Australia's most populous cities, Melbourne and Sydney, as a result of fires during the so-called Black Summer which ran from November 2019 through to February 2020. Following this period, social, mobility and economic restrictions to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic were implemented in Australia. We quantify the air quality impact of these contrasting periods in the south-eastern states of Victoria and New South Wales (NSW) using a meteorological normalisation approach. A Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was used to compute baseline time series' of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide CO and particulate matter with diameter < 2.5 μm (PM2.5), based on a 19 year, detrended training dataset. Across Victorian sites, large increases in CO (188%), PM2.5 (322%) and ozone (22%) were observed over the RF prediction in January 2020. In NSW, smaller pollutant increases above the RF prediction were seen (CO 58%, PM2.5 80%, ozone 19%). This can be partly explained by the RF predictions being high compared to the mean of previous months, due to high temperatures and strong wind speeds, highlighting the importance of meteorological normalisation in attributing pollution changes to specific events. From the daily observation-RF prediction differences we estimated 249.8 (95% CI: 156.6-343.) excess deaths and 3490.0 (95% CI 1325.9-5653.5) additional hospitalisations were likely as a result of PM2.5 and O3 exposure in Victoria and NSW. During April 2019, when COVID-19 restrictions were in place, on average NO2 decreased by 21.5 and 8% in Victoria and NSW respectively. O3 and PM2.5 remained effectively unchanged in Victoria on average but increased by 20 and 24% in NSW respectively, supporting the suggestion that community mobility reduced more in Victoria than NSW. Overall the air quality change during the COVID-19 lockdown had a negligible impact on the calculated health outcomes.","Ryan, Robert G; Silver, Jeremy D; Schofield, Robyn",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.116498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33524649/,15

We have analyzed the growth behavior of the top 25 most affected countries by means of a local slope analysis and found three distinct patterns that individual countries follow depending on the strictness of the lockdown protocols: rise and fall, power law, or logistic. For countries showing power law growth we have determined the scaling exponents. For countries that showed a strong slowdown in the rate of infections we have extrapolated the expected saturation of the total number of infections and the expected final date. Three different extrapolation methods (logistic, parabolic, and cutoff power law) were used. All methods agree on the order of magnitude of saturation and end dates. Global infection rates are analyzed with the same methods. The relevance and accuracy of these extrapolations is discussed.","Singer, Herman M",Physical biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1478-3975/ab9bf5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32526721/,15
87674,Selective Binding and Elution of Aptamers for Pesticides Based on Sol-Gel-Coated Nanoporous Anodized Aluminum Oxide Membrane.,2020-08-05,"BACKGROUND Whole blood (WB) is optimal for resuscitation of traumatic haemorrhage. Walking Blood Banks (WBB) provide fresh whole blood (FWB) where conventional blood components or stored, tested WB are not readily available. There is an increasing interest in this as an emergency resilience measure for isolated communities and during crises including the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available evidence to inform practice. METHODS Standard systematic review methodology was used to obtain studies that reported the delivery of FWB (PROSPERO registry CRD42019153849). Studies that only reported WB from conventional blood banking were excluded. For outcomes, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random effects modelling due to high risk of heterogeneity. Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. RESULTS 27 studies published from 2006 - 2020 reported >10,000 units of FWB for >3000 patients (precise values not available for all studies). Evidence for studies was ""low"" or ""very low"" except for one study which was ""moderate"" in quality. FWB patients were more severely injured than non-FWB patients. Overall, survival was equivalent between FWB and non-FWB groups for 8 studies that compared these (OR 1.00 (95% CI 0.65, 1.55); p=0.61). However, the highest quality study (matched groups for physiological and injury characteristics) reported an adjusted OR of 0.27 (95% CI 0.13-0.58) for mortality for the FWB group; p<0.01. CONCLUSIONS Thousands of units of FWB from WBBs have been transfused in patients following life-threatening haemorrhage. Survival is equivalent for FWB resuscitation when compared to non-FWB, even when patients were more severely injured. Evidence is scarce and of relative low quality and may underestimate potential adverse events. Whereas WBB may be an attractive resilience measure, caution is still advised. WBBs should be subject to prospective evaluation to optimise care and inform policy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were collected from all patients undergoing PH repair between December 2001 and October 2011. Outcome data were compared between the acute and elective groups. RESULTS Over the study period, 268 patients underwent PH repair, of which 42 patients underwent acute repair compared with 226 elective repairs. Morbidity and mortality rates were both higher, albeit nonsignificantly, in the acute group (16.6% vs. 6.6%, P=0.058 and 4.8% vs. 0.4%, P=0.065, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Because of the poorer preoperative medical status, lower success rates of minimal access surgery, and longer inpatient stay, combined with the trends toward increased morbidity and mortality rates, of patients undergoing acute repair of PH, we would recommend routine elective laparoscopic surgery as the standard of care for individuals with symptomatic PH and minimal comorbidities.","Staerkle, Ralph F; Skipworth, Richard J E; Hansen, Ross D; Hazebroek, Eric J; Smith, Garett S; Leibman, Steven","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25222713/,15
88622,Corrigendum.,2020-12-01,"The identification of cellular proteins associated with virus replicase complexes is crucial to our understanding of virus-host interactions, influencing the host range, replication, and virulence of viruses. A previous in vitro study has demonstrated that partially purified Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) replicase complexes can be employed for the replication of both BaMV genomic and satellite BaMV (satBaMV) RNAs. In this study, we investigated the BaMV and satBaMV 3' untranslated region (UTR) binding proteins associated with these replicase complexes. Two cellular proteins with molecular masses of ∼35 and ∼55 kDa were specifically cross-linked with RNA elements, whereupon the ∼35-kDa protein was identified as the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Gel mobility shift assays confirmed the direct interaction of GAPDH with the 3' UTR sequences, and competition gel shift analysis revealed that GAPDH binds preferentially to the positive-strand BaMV and satBaMV RNAs over the negative-strand RNAs. It was observed that the GAPDH protein binds to the pseudoknot poly(A) tail of BaMV and stem-loop-C poly(A) tail of satBaMV 3' UTR RNAs. It is important to note that knockdown of GAPDH in Nicotiana benthamiana enhances the accumulation of BaMV and satBaMV RNA; conversely, transient overexpression of GAPDH reduces the accumulation of BaMV and satBaMV RNA. The recombinant GAPDH principally inhibits the synthesis of negative-strand RNA in exogenous RdRp assays. These observations support the contention that cytosolic GAPDH participates in the negative regulation of BaMV and satBaMV RNA replication.","Prasanth, K Reddisiva; Huang, Ying-Wen; Liou, Ming-Ru; Wang, Robert Yung-Liang; Hu, Chung-Chi; Tsai, Ching-Hsiu; Meng, Menghsiao; Lin, Na-Sheng; Hsu, Yau-Heiu",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00556-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21715476/,15

The aim of this study was to compare SR with RFA as first-line treatment in patients with perivascular HCC and to evaluate the long-term outcomes of both therapies. METHODS This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. The requirement for informed consent was waived. Between January 2006 and December 2010, a total of 283 consecutive patients with small perivascular HCCs (≤3 cm, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 or A) underwent SR (n = 182) or RFA (n = 101) as a first-line treatment. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were compared by propensity score matching. Subgroup analysis of these outcomes was conducted according to the type of hepatic vessels. RESULTS The median follow-up was 7.8 years. Matching yielded 62 pairs of patients. In the two matched groups, the PFS rates at 5 and 10 years were 58.0% and 17.8%, respectively, in the SR group, and 25.4% and 14.1%, respectively, in the RFA group (p <0.001). The corresponding OS rates at 5 and 10 years were 93.5% and 91.9% in the SR group and 82.3% and 74.1% in the RFA group, respectively (p <0.001). In contrast to those in patients with perivenous HCCs, subgroup analysis indicated that extrahepatic recurrence and OS were significantly different according to the treatment modality in patients with periportal HCCs (p = 0.004 and p <0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS In patients with small perivascular HCCs, SR provided better long-term tumor control and OS than RFA, particularly for periportal tumors. LAY SUMMARY Surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation are both treatment options for perivascular hepatocellular carcinoma. We compared outcomes in patients treated with either method. Surgical resection provided better long-term tumor control and overall survival than radiofrequency ablation for patients with a small perivascular hepatocellular carcinoma (≤3 cm) as a first-line treatment, particularly for periportal tumors. The location of the tumor and the type of peritumoral hepatic vessels need to be considered when choosing between surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation for small HCCs.","Lee, Sunyoung; Kang, Tae Wook; Cha, Dong Ik; Song, Kyoung Doo; Lee, Min Woo; Rhim, Hyunchul; Lim, Hyo Keun; Sinn, Dong Hyun; Kim, Jong Man; Kim, Kyunga",Journal of hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2018.02.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29524532/,15

Environmental contaminants such as heavy metals (e.g., Cd, As, Pb, and V) and organic pesticides (e.g., glyphosate) in the drinking water have been hypothesized to play a role in childhood onset and progression of this disease. However, a comprehensive analysis of chemical contaminants in the drinking water and effects of these compounds and their mixtures on kidney development and function remains unknown. Here, we conducted targeted and non-targeted chemical analyses of sediment and drinking water in CKDu affected regions in Sri Lanka, one of the most affected countries. Using zebrafish Danio rerio, a toxicology and kidney disease model, we then examined kidney developmental effects of exposure to (i) environmentally derived samples from CKDu endemic and non-endemic regions and (ii) Cd, As, V, Pb, and glyphosate as individual compounds and in mixtures. We found that drinking water is contaminated with various organic chemicals including nephrotoxic compounds as well as heavy metals, but at levels considered safe for drinking. Histological studies and gene expression analyses examining markers of kidney development (pax2a) and kidney injury (kim1) showed novel metal and glyphosate-metal mixture specific effects on kidney development. Mitochondrial dysfunction is directly linked to kidney failure, and examination of mixture specific mitochondrial toxicity showed altered mitochondrial function following treatment with environmental samples from endemic regions. Collectively, we show that metals in drinking water, even at safe levels, can impede kidney development at an early age, potentiating increased susceptibility to other agrochemicals such as glyphosate. Drinking water contaminant effects on mitochondria can further contribute to progression of kidney dysfunction and our mitochondrial assay may help identify regions at risk of CKDu.","Babich, Remy; Ulrich, Jake C; Ekanayake, E M Dilini V; Massarsky, Andrey; De Silva, P Mangala C S; Manage, Pathmalal M; Jackson, Brian P; Ferguson, P Lee; Di Giulio, Richard T; Drummond, Iain A; Jayasundara, Nishad",Environment international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.106019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818823/,15

92982,Vero cell platform in vaccine production: moving towards cell culture-based viral vaccines.,2009,"Vaping is the act of inhaling an aerosol generated by an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette), a battery-powered device that heats a reservoir of liquid, typically nicotine-containing, to deliver contents to the user. E-cigarettes were initially introduced as a means of smoking cessation, although evidence of their effectiveness is limited. There is a widespread perception that these products are a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, driven in large part by marketing efforts by e-cigarette manufacturers. Yet to achieve vaporization, temperatures are so high that components of the device hardware, such as metals, plastics, rubber and foam, are aerosolized and inhaled along with the vaporized e-liquid containing nicotine, flavoring and solvents. We do not fully understand the health consequences of such aerosol exposure, particularly long-term effects, but short-term negative cardiovascular and respiratory effects have been demonstrated. Very few studies have evaluated the reproductive effect of e-cigarette use. We do not know whether vaping during pregnancy affects birth outcomes or the lifelong health of the fetus. There has been an exponential rise in the use of e-cigarettes in the United States since their introduction, particularly among youths, while concurrently there has been a laudable reduction in conventional cigarette use. It is imperative that obstetrician-gynecologists have a basic understanding of e-cigarettes, screen all patients as is consistently done for conventional smoking, and provide resources to patients about potential negative consequences of use.","Wylie, Blair J; Hauptman, Marissa; Hacker, Michele R; Hawkins, Summer S",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000004282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33543893/,15

This article shares information about the infected children from a treatment center in Chongqing, China. Methods A retrospective analysis of the epidemiology, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest computed tomography results, treatment effect of 11 children infected by 2019-nCoV was performed. Children were diagnosed from January 25 to February 29, 2020 in Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital. Results The mean age of the 11 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 11 years and 5 months. Two cases (18%) were imported cases from Wuhan. The 9 cases (82%) were family cluster cases. There were 5 asymptomatic type cases (45%), 2 mild cases (18%), and 4 common type cases (37%). The most common symptom was fever (5 cases), cough (3 cases), sore throat (1 case) and diarrhea (1 case). There were abnormal chest CT changes in 6 cases, including 4 cases with patchy ground-glass opacities and 2 cases with thickened lung texture. Laboratory tests showed that procalcitonin increased in 4 cases (36%), and C-reactive protein (CRP) increased in 1 case (9%). In lymphocyte subgroup examination, lymphocyte count increased in 2 cases (18%) and decreased in 1 case (9%); T%, cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T%, and natural killer (NK) cell% were normal in 11 cases; CD4+ T% was increased in 2 cases (18%), and CD4+ T%/CD8+ T% was decreased in 1 case (9%); B% was increased in 1 case (9%). The interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-10, and IL-17 in 11 cases were normal; IL-6 was increased in 7 cases (64%); tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was increased in 1 case (9%); and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) was increased in 6 cases (55%). All patients had been discharged from the hospital. Conclusions Children are generally susceptible to 2019-nCoV, and the main way of infection is close contact with an infected person in the family.

An anthropomorphic lung nodule phantom was scanned with standard (120kVp, 62mAs), low (120kVp, 11mAs), and ultra-low (80kVp, 3mAs) radiation doses. A human volunteer underwent standard (120kVp, 63mAs) and low (120kVp, 11mAs) dose scans after approval by the ethics committee. HR images were reconstructed with 1024 matrix, 300mm field of view and 0.25mm slice thickness using a filtered-back projection (FBP) and two levels of iterative reconstruction (iDose 5 and 9). The conspicuity and sharpness of various lung structures (distal airways, vessels, fissures and proximal bronchial wall), image noise, and overall image quality were independently analyzed by three radiologists and compared to a previous HR lung CT examination of the same volunteer performed with a conventional CT equipped with energy integrating detectors (120kVp, 10mAs, FBP). RESULTS Ten percent MTF was measured at 22.3lp/cm with a cut-off at 31lp/cm. Up to 28lp/cm were depicted. While mixed and solid nodules were easily depicted on standard and low-dose phantom images, higher iDose levels and slice thicknesses (1mm) were needed to visualize ground-glass components on ultra-low-dose images. Standard dose SPCCT images of in vivo lung structures were of greater conspicuity and sharpness, with greater overall image quality, and similar image noise (despite a flux reduction of 23%) to conventional CT images. Low-dose SPCCT images were of greater or similar conspicuity and sharpness, similar overall image quality, and lower but acceptable image noise (despite a flux reduction of 89%). CONCLUSIONS A large field-of-view SPCCT prototype demonstrates HR technical capabilities and high image quality for high resolution lung CT in human.","Si-Mohamed, Salim; Boccalini, Sara; Rodesch, Pierre-Antoine; Dessouky, Riham; Lahoud, Elias; Broussaud, Thomas; Sigovan, Monica; Gamondes, Delphine; Coulon, Philippe; Yagil, Yoad; Boussel, Loïc; Douek, Philippe",Diagnostic and interventional imaging,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diii.2021.01.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33610503/,15

Thus, there is a need to develop and explore novel inotropic therapies that can act via calcium-independent mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to determine whether fast alpha-myosin molecular motor gene transfer can confer calcium-independent positive inotropy in slow beta-myosin-dominant rabbit and human failing ventricular myocytes. To this end, we generated a recombinant adenovirus (AdMYH6) to deliver the full-length human alpha-myosin gene to adult rabbit and human cardiac myocytes in vitro. Fast alpha-myosin motor expression was determined by Western blotting and immunocytochemical analysis and confocal imaging. In experiments using electrically stimulated myocytes from ischemic failing hearts, AdMYH6 increased the contractile amplitude of failing human [23.9+/-7.8 nm (n=10) vs. AdMYH6 amplitude 78.4+/-16.5 nm (n=6)] and rabbit myocytes. The intracellular calcium transient amplitude was not altered. Control experiments included the use of a green fluorescent protein or a beta-myosin heavy chain adenovirus. Our data provide evidence for a novel form of calcium-independent positive inotropy in failing cardiac myocytes by fast alpha-myosin motor protein gene transfer.","Herron, Todd J; Devaney, Eric; Mundada, Lakshmi; Arden, Erik; Day, Sharlene; Guerrero-Serna, Guadalupe; Turner, Immanuel; Westfall, Margaret; Metzger, Joseph M",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.09-140566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19801488/,15

96957,Know your enemy or find your friend?-Induction of IgA at mucosal surfaces.,2021-07-30,"BACKGROUND Mindfulness programmes as a potential avenue of enhancing pupil wellbeing are beginning to show great promise. However, research concerning the effectiveness of mindfulness training for primary aged school children (7-11 years of age) has been neglected. METHODS Building on methodological limitations of prior research, this study employed an active controlled design to assess the longer term wellbeing and emotion regulation outcomes after a 6 week mindfulness programme (Living Mindfully Programme, UK), for a group of school children aged between 9 and 10. The programme was delivered by class teachers as part of their normal curriculum entitlement. One hundred and eight children took part from across three schools in North East of England. Participants formed a treatment group (n = 64), active control (n = 19) and wait list control (n = 25). Self-report measures of wellbeing, mindfulness and emotion regulation were collected at pre and post training as well as at 3 months follow up. RESULTS Reliable findings, judged by medium to large effect sizes across both post intervention, follow-up and between both controls, demonstrated enhancement in a number of domains. Immediately after training and follow up, when compared with the wait list control, children who received mindfulness training showed significant improvements in mindfulness (d = .76 and .77), Positive Outlook (d = .55 and .64) and Life Satisfaction (d = .65 and 0.72). Even when compared to an active control, the effects remained although diminished reflecting the positive impact of the active control condition. Furthermore, a significant positive relationship was found between changes in mindfulness and changes in cognitive reappraisal. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, this study provides preliminary evidence that the Living Mindfully Primary Programme is feasibly delivered by school staff, enjoyed by the children and may significantly improve particular components of wellbeing. Importantly, higher levels of mindfulness as a result of training may be related to effective emotional regulatory and cognitive reappraisal strategies.","Amundsen, R; Riby, L M; Hamilton, C; Hope, M; McGann, D",BMC psychology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-020-00428-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641161/,15

The aim of the study is to evaluate the incidence of IH after robot-assisted RYGB (RA-RYGB) performed with the ""Double Loop"" technique at our Institution. METHODS Prospective cohort study of patients submitted to RA-RYGB with the ""Double Loop"" technique, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Patients with complaints of abdominal pain at clinical visits or entering the emergency department were evaluated. Primary outcome was the incidence of IH, defined as the presence of herniated bowel through a mesenteric defect, diagnosed at imaging or at surgical exploration. RESULTS A total of 129 patients were included: 65 (50.4%) were primary procedures, while 64 (49.6%) were revisional operations after primary restrictive bariatric surgery. Mean age was 47.9 ± 10.2 years, mean weight, and body mass index were, respectively, 105.3 ± 22.6 kg and 39.7 ± 9.6 kg/m2. Postoperative morbidity rate was 7.0%. Mean follow-up was 53.2 ± 22.6 (range 24-94) months. During the follow-up period, a total of 14 (10.8%) patients entered the emergency department: 1 patient had melena, 4 renal colic, 1 acute cholecystitis, 2 gynecologic pathologies, 2 anastomotic ulcers, 1 perforated gastric ulcer, 1 diverticulitis and 2 gastroenteritis. There were no diagnoses of IH. During the follow-up period, no patient experienced recurrence of symptoms.

97453,Defining human dendritic cell progenitors by multiparametric flow cytometry.,2015,"INTRODUCTION Zika virus (ZIKV) is transmitted to humans throughout bites of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) mosquitoes. ZIKV infection may be asymptomatic in most cases, but it may cause fever, headache, muscle pain, and rash. Guillain-Barré syndrome also may be associated with the infection. Furthermore, the PanAmerican Health Organization informed a total of 3,715 cases confirmed of the congenital Zika virus syndrome (CZS) in the Americas from 2015 - 2017, which may include microcephaly, eye abnormalities, craniofacial disproportion, or articular deformities. AREAS COVERED This review identifies patent documents on repositioning for ZIKV infection treatment of already approved drugs or phases II/III investigated drugs for other diseases. A total of 36 documents were found reporting compounds with anti-ZIKV activity within ranging from 2015 to 2019. EXPERT OPINION The main drugs claimed were ribavirin, sofosbuvir, and alpha-interferons. Likewise, the lopinavir-ritonavir combination, montelukast, and niclosamide were described as ZIKV inhibitors in some documents. Some investigational drugs such as emricasam, castanospermine, and flavonoids were also disclosed. Preventing the risk of CSZ is one of the most significant challenges in ZIKV infection. Therefore, repositioning sofosbuvir and niclosamide, drugs studied at least in two patents from different groups, for example, that pose no danger for pregnant women is a particular issue to be considered for clinical tests involving ZIKV disease. Given the substantial costs and developing time of new a drug, repositioning of old drugs is progressively becoming an attractive alternative, especially for diseases with neglected treatments.","G Viveiros Rosa, Sandro; Fierro, Iolanda M; Santos, Wilson C",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,https://doi.org/10.1080/13543776.2020.1811854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842803/,15

METHODS In this double-blind, phase II study (NCT01420744), 160 patients with sCAP requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were randomized (1:1) to trimodulin (42 mg IgM/kg/day) or placebo for five consecutive days. Primary endpoint was ventilator-free days (VFDs). Secondary endpoints included 28-day all-cause and pneumonia-related mortality. Safety and tolerability were monitored. Exploratory post hoc analyses were performed in subsets stratified by baseline C-reactive protein (CRP; ≥ 70 mg/L) and/or IgM (≤ 0.8 g/L). RESULTS Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in VFDs between trimodulin (mean 11.0, median 11 [n = 81]) and placebo (mean 9.6; median 8 [n = 79]; p = 0.173). Twenty-eight-day all-cause mortality was 22.2% vs. 27.8%, respectively (p = 0.465). Time to discharge from intensive care unit and mean duration of hospitalization were comparable between groups. Adverse-event incidences were comparable. Post hoc subset analyses, which included the majority of patients (58-78%), showed significant reductions in all-cause mortality (trimodulin vs. placebo) in patients with high CRP, low IgM, and high CRP/low IgM at baseline. CONCLUSIONS No significant differences were found in VFDs and mortality between trimodulin and placebo groups. Post hoc analyses supported improved outcome regarding mortality with trimodulin in subsets of patients with elevated CRP, reduced IgM, or both. These findings warrant further investigation.

98158,Superparamagnetic nanoparticle capture of prions for amplification.,2011,"IMPORTANCE Little data exist on end-of-life care practices in intensive care units (ICUs) in Asia. OBJECTIVE To describe physicians' attitudes toward withholding and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments in end-of-life care and to evaluate factors associated with observed attitudes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Self-administered structured and scenario-based survey conducted among 1465 physicians (response rate, 59.6%) who manage patients in ICUs (May-December 2012) at 466 ICUs (response rate, 59.4%) in 16 Asian countries and regions. RESULTS For patients with no real chance of recovering a meaningful life, 1029 respondents (70.2%) reported almost always or often withholding whereas 303 (20.7%) reported almost always or often withdrawing life-sustaining treatments; 1092 respondents (74.5%) deemed withholding and withdrawal ethically different. The majority of respondents reported that vasopressors, hemodialysis, and antibiotics could usually be withheld or withdrawn in end-of-life care, but not enteral feeding, intravenous fluids, and oral suctioning. For severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest, 1201 respondents (82.0% [range between countries, 48.4%-100%]) would implement do-not-resuscitate orders, but 788 (53.8% [range, 6.1%-87.2%]) would maintain mechanical ventilation and start antibiotics and vasopressors if indicated. On multivariable analysis, refusal to implement do-not-resuscitate orders was more likely with physicians who did not value families' or surrogates' requests (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.67 [95% CI, 1.16-2.40]; P = .006), who were uncomfortable discussing end-of-life care (AOR, 2.38 [95% CI, 1.62-3.51]; P < .001), who perceived greater legal risk (AOR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.26-2.94]; P = .002), and in low- to middle-income economies (AOR, 2.73 [95% CI, 1.56-4.76]; P < .001). Nonimplementation was less likely with physicians of Protestant (AOR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.16-0.80]; P = .01) and Catholic (AOR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.09-0.58]; P = .002) faiths, and when out-of-pocket health care expenditure increased (AOR, 0.98 per percentage of total health care expenditure [95% CI, 0.97-0.99]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Whereas physicians in ICUs in Asia reported that they often withheld but seldom withdrew life-sustaining treatments at the end of life, attitudes and practice varied widely across countries and regions. Multiple factors related to country or region, including economic, cultural, religious, and legal differences, as well as personal attitudes, were associated with these variations.

98311,Review: Defensins and cathelicidins in lung immunity.,2010,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed tumors among human worldwide. Angiogenesis and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment are closely associated with CRC development. Nevertheless, the mechanisms revealing CRC progression are still not fully understood. 5'-Nucleotidase domain containing 2 (NT5DC2), a member of the NT5DC family, modulates various cellular events to mediate tumor growth, and thus serves as a disgnostic biomarker. Here, we explored the potential of NT5DC2 on tumor progression in CRC. We first found that NT5DC2 expression was significantly up-regulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. CRC patients with higher NT5DC2 expression showed poor overall survival. Furthermore, CRC cell lines stably transfected with shNT5DC2 lentivirus plasmids exhibited markedly reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion compared with the negative control group. Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression levels were remarkably reduced in CRC cells with NT5DC2 deletion, along with evidently reduced tube formation in the HUVECs cultured in the collected conditional medium. The expression levels of CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and its receptor CCR2 were found to be greatly down-regulated in CRC cells transfected with shNT5DC2. Moreover, NT5DC2 knockdown markedly suppressed the activation of protein kinase-B/nuclear transcription factor κB (AKT/NF-κB) signaling in CRC cells. Furthermore, we found that NT5DC2 deletion obviously reduced the TAM recruitments through suppressing CCL2/CCR2 and AKT/NF-κB signaling pathways. Intriguingly, our in vitro experiments demonstrated that VEGF reduction was necessary for shNT5DC2-inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and TAM recruitment. In vivo studies also confirmed that NT5DC2 knockdown effectively reduced the tumor growth and VEGF expression in a xonegraft mouse model with CRC. Lung metastasis of CRC cells was also hindered by NT5DC2 deletion in vivo. Collectively, our results indicated a previously unrecognized NT5DC2/VEGF/CCL2 axis involved in CRC development and metastasis.","Zhu, Zhenyu; Hou, Qingsheng; Guo, Hongliang",Experimental cell research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2020.112311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991874/,15

RECENT FINDINGS The United Nations Convention has ushered in a new era of discourse that moves beyond a consideration of individual impairments, to focus on the social and environmental barriers that prevent full and effective social participation of people with disabilities. It provides an important social justice framework to guide and integrate disability policy within and across countries. In order to realize its potential, the mental health community must now actively develop a new disability discourse - one that moves beyond the traditional focus on negative protections, such as against forced confinement or coercive treatment, to one that examines the services and supports that are needed to allow people who have a mental illness to become fully functioning members of society. To meet the monitoring requirements of the Convention, the mental health community must actively seek population data to assess the nature of prejudice and discrimination experienced by people with a mental illness. An approach used by Statistics Canada is provided as one such example. SUMMARY The United Nations Convention is an important roadmap for change, which can be used to shift current mental health discourse from a discussion emphasizing the protection of negative rights, such as from involuntary detention or coerced treatment, to one emphasizing social rights and civic participation.","Stuart, Heather",Current opinion in psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0b013e328356b7ed; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22801359/,15
99020,Preparation of Vortex Porous Graphene Chiral Membrane for Enantioselective Separation.,2020-08-24,"BACKGROUND In stable ischaemic heart disease (SIHD), measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR) to guide selection of lesions for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) reduces death and myocardial infarction (MI) compared with angiographic guidance. However, it is unknown if the improved outcomes are due to avoidance of stenting of physiologically insignificant lesions or are a by-product of placing fewer stents. METHODS We developed a Monte Carlo simulation using the PCI strata of the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes study to investigate how random deferral of PCI impacts outcomes. To simulate deferral, a randomly selected group of patients randomised to PCI were removed and replaced by an equal number of randomly selected patients randomised to intensive medical therapy (IMT) using a random number generator in Python's NumPy module. The primary endpoint was the rate of death or non-fatal MI at 1 year. RESULTS Death/MI at 1 year occurred in 8.3% of 798 patients in the PCI group and 5.1% of 807 patients in the IMT control group (p=0.02). Following 10 000 iterations of random replacement of 10%, 20%, 30% or 40% of PCI patients with randomly selected IMT patients, the rate of death/MI at 1 year progressively declined from 8.3% to 8.0%, 7.6%, 7.3% and 7.0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In this simulation model, random deferral of PCI procedures in SIHD progressively reduced death/MI as the percentage of procedures deferred increases. FFR-guided deferral of PCI may improve outcomes as a result of placing fewer stents and be unrelated to the haemodynamic severity of lesions.","Williams, Conor; Brown, David L",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2019-316432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719096/,15

However, cell therapy activates the innate immune response, leading to the rapid elimination of transplanted cells and only short-term therapeutic delivery. Herein, we describe a new strategy to deliver sustained paracrine-mediated MSC therapy to ischemic myocardium. Using an immune evasive, small molecule modified alginate, we encapsulated rat MSC cells in a core-shell hydrogel capsule and implanted them in the pericardial sac of post-MI rats. Encapsulated cells allowed diffusion of reparative paracrine factors at levels similar to non-encapsulated cells in vitro. Encapsulation enabled sustained cell survival with localization over the heart for 2 weeks. The effect of the experimental group on ventricular function and fibrosis was compared with blank (cell free) capsules and unencapsulated MSCs injected into infarcted myocardium. MSC capsules improved post-MI ventricular function ∼2.5× greater than MSC injection. After 4 weeks, post-MI fibrosis was reduced ∼2/3 with MSC capsules, but unchanged with MSC injection. MSC encapsulation with alginate core-shell capsules sustains cell survival and potentiates efficacy of therapy.","Ghanta, Ravi K; Aghlara-Fotovat, Samira; Pugazenthi, Aarthi; Ryan, Christopher T; Singh, Vivek P; Mathison, Megumi; Jarvis, Maria I; Mukherjee, Sudip; Hernandez, Andrea; Veiseh, Omid",Biomaterials science,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0bm00855a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797143/,15

Material and methods Medical recordings of 385 consecutive patients with prostate carcinoma have been evaluated, and 70 patients who have undergone RALRP-BS were compared with 70 patients with RALRP-NBS in a matched - pairs design. Preoperative clinical parameters (age, prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, Gleason score of the prostate biopsy, and prostate volume) and operative data (operation, docking, console, posterior reconstruction (PR), anastomosis times, duration of catheter, length of hospital stay, estimated blood loss, time to perform the anastomosis and its quality) were evaluated, as well as postoperative parameters (pathological stage, Gleason score, specimen weight, follow-up duration, biochemical recurrence, complication rates, and duration of postoperative analgesic treatment). Results No statistically significant difference was found for pre-operative parameters between the two groups. Although, anastomosis time, quality of anastomosis, duration of urethral catheter and total anesthesia time were significantly less in the RALRP-BS group than in the RALRP-NBS group (P <0.01). Other peri- and postoperative parameters were not statistically significant between the two groups. Pathological data and the follow-up period and complication rates were similar between the two groups. Conclusions This study showed that, RALRP-BS is a safe, efficient and cost-effective PR and VUA during RALRP than compared with RALRP-NBS. Shorter anastomosis time, operative time and posterior reconstruction time, while it may be equivalent with regard to estimated blood loss (EBL), catheterization time and early continence rates at 4-6 weeks.","Erdogru, Tibet; Celik, Orcun; Hladun, Taras; Kazimoglu, Hatem; Micoogullari, Uygar; Akincioglu, Emir; Ulker, Volkan; Cakmak, Ozgur; Can, Ertan",Central European journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.5173/ceju.2020.0105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32782831/,15

102341,Coronaviruses as the emerging threats for human health: should we be prepared for the future outbreaks of new coronaviruses?,2020,"BACKGROUND Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) provides an excellent view of the resection margins for rectal cancer from below, but is challenging due to few anatomical landmarks. During implementation of this technique, patient safety and optimal outcomes need to be ensured. The aim of this study was to evaluate the learning curve of TaTME in patients with rectal cancer in order to optimize future training programs. METHODS All consecutive patients after TaTME for rectal cancer between February 2012 and January 2017 were included in a single-center database. Influence of surgical experience on major postoperative complications, leakage rate and operating time was evaluated using cumulative sum charts and the splitting model. Correction for potential case-mix differences was performed. RESULTS Over a period of 60 months, a total of 138 patients were included in this study. Adjusted for case-mix, improvement in postoperative outcomes was clearly seen after the first 40 patients, showing a decrease in major postoperative complications from 47.5 to 17.5% and leakage rate from 27.5 to 5%. Mean operating time (42 min) and conversion rate (from 10% to zero) was lower after transition to a two-team approach, but neither endpoint decreased with experience. Readmission and reoperation rates were not influenced by surgical experience. CONCLUSIONS The learning curve of TaTME affected major (surgical) postoperative complications for the first 40 patients. A two-team approach decreased operative time and conversion rate. When implementing this new technique, a thorough teaching and supervisory program is recommended to shorten the learning curve and improve the clinical outcomes of the first patients.","Koedam, T W A; Veltcamp Helbach, M; van de Ven, P M; Kruyt, Ph M; van Heek, N T; Bonjer, H J; Tuynman, J B; Sietses, C",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-018-1771-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29569099/,15

We aimed to synthesize evidence on interventions to increase six personal protective behaviours (e.g., hand hygiene, face mask use, maintaining physical distancing) to limit the spread of respiratory viruses. METHODS We used best practice for rapid evidence reviews. We searched Ovid MEDLINE and Scopus. Studies conducted in adults or children with active or passive comparators were included. We extracted data on study design, intervention content, mode of delivery, population, setting, mechanism(s) of action, acceptability, practicability, effectiveness, affordability, spill-over effects, and equity impact. Study quality was assessed with Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool. A narrative synthesis and random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. RESULTS We identified 39 studies conducted across 15 countries. Interventions targeted hand hygiene (n = 30) and/or face mask use (n = 12) and used two- or three-arm study designs with passive comparators. Interventions were typically delivered face-to-face and included a median of three behaviour change techniques. The quality of included studies was low. Interventions to increase hand hygiene (k = 6) had a medium, positive effect (d = .62, 95% CI = 0.43-0.80, p < .001, I2 = 81.2%). Interventions targeting face mask use (k = 4) had mixed results, with an imprecise pooled estimate (OR = 4.14, 95% CI = 1.24-13.79, p < .001, I2 = 89.67%). Between-study heterogeneity was high. CONCLUSIONS We found low-quality evidence for positive effects of interventions targeting hand hygiene, with unclear results for interventions targeting face mask use. There was a lack of evidence for most behaviours of interest within this review.","Perski, Olga; Szinay, Dorothy; Corker, Elizabeth; Shahab, Lion; West, Robert; Michie, Susan",British journal of health psychology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173697/,15

103786,The role of antibodies in HIV vaccines.,2010,"Background The best way to control hemorrhage from cardiac injuries is through digital occlusion followed by suture. However, this is difficult to accomplish in the emergency department (ED) setting. Generally, temporary control is obtained in advance of definitive treatment in the operating room. Despite safety and efficacy concerns, balloon Foley catheter insertion through the injury is still an option following ED thoracotomies. We developed a new device for temporary hemorrhage control in cardiac injuries and compared it to the Foley. Methods 6 adult swine (n=6) underwent full-thickness (1.5 cm) injury along the longitudinal axis of the right ventricle (RV). After 5 s of bleeding, hemorrhage control was attempted with either the device or the Foley, and blood loss quantified. Subsequently, the wound was sutured and mean arterial pressure was restored to baseline with lactated Ringer's infusion. Subsequently, another injury 2 cm apart in the same ventricle was managed with apparatus not employed in the first injury. The same followed in the LV totaling 4 injuries per animal, 2 in each ventricle. Intraoperative echocardiogram, laboratory test and final wound sizes assessed. Results The device resulted in less bleeding than the Foley; RV 58.7±11.3 vs 147.7±30.9 mL, LV 81.7±11.9 vs 187.5±40.3 mL (p<0.05). Percent change in tricuspid regurgitation was less with the device than FO, 66.6% vs 400%. Mitral regurgitation increased 16% with Foley, but remained unchanged with the device. Changes in stroke volume and LV ejection fraction were less with the device than with Foley; SV 2.09% vs 12.48%, left ventricular ejection fraction 0.46% vs 5.45%. Foley insertion enlarged the wounds. Platelet count, complete blood count, prothrombin time, activated prothrombin time and fibrinogen decreased, whereas troponin and lactate increased compared with baseline, underscoring the magnitude of shock. Conclusions Cardiac hemorrhage was effectively controlled with the new device. The low-profile collapsible blocking membrane interfered less with cardiac function than did the balloon of the Foley, an important asset in the context of shock.","Rezende-Neto, Joao Baptista; Leong-Poi, Howard; Rizoli, Sandro; Beckett, Andrew",Trauma surgery & acute care open,https://doi.org/10.1136/tsaco-2016-000012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29766056/,15

For urologists, it has affected and will continue to influence how we approach the care of patients pre-operatively, intra-operatively, and post-operatively. A risk-benefit assessment of each patient undergoing surgery should be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the urgency of the surgery and the risk of viral illness and transmission. Patients with advanced age and comorbidities have a higher incidence of mortality. Routine preoperative testing and symptom screening is recommended to identify those with COVID-19. Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for the surgical team is essential to protect healthcare workers and ensure an adequate workforce. For COVID-19 positive or suspected patients, the use of N95 respirators is recommended if available. The anesthesia method chosen should attempt to minimize aerosolization of the virus. Negative pressure rooms are strongly preferred for intubation/extubation and other aerosolizing procedures. Although transmission has not yet been shown during laparoscopic and robotic procedures, efforts should be made to minimize the risk of aerosolization. Ultra low particulate air filters are recommended for use during minimally invasive procedures to decrease the risk of viral transmission. Thorough cleaning and sterilization should be performed post-operatively with adequate time allowed for the operating room air to be cycled after procedures. COVID-19 patients should be separated from non-infected patients at all levels of care including recovery to decrease the risk of infection. Future directions will be guided by outcomes and infection rates as social distancing guidelines are relaxed and more surgical procedures are reintroduced. Recommendations should be adapted to the local environment and will continue to evolve as more data becomes available, the shortage of testing and PPE is resolved, and a vaccine and therapeutics for COVID-19 are developed.","Steward, James; Kitley, Weston Riley; Schmidt, C Max; Sundaram, Chandru P",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2020.0342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336150/,15

106465,A novel method for precise detection of allergen-specific IgE via immobilizing His-tagged allergens to paper-based device.,2020-07-27,"Psychological stress is an important factor in susceptibility to many diseases. Our laboratory has been investigating the impact of stress on the susceptibility to Theiler's virus-induced demyelination (TVID), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Using immunodominant viral peptides specific for identification of either CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells, stress reduced IFN-gamma-producing virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the spleen and CD8(+) T cells in the CNS. Expression of mRNA for the Th1 transcription factor T-bet and the Th2 transcription factor GATA-3 were decreased in spleen cells isolated from stressed mice. Cytokine production by cells isolated from the CNS or spleens following stimulation with virus indicated that stress decreased both type 1 and type 2 responses. The adverse effects of stress were partially reversed by concurrent RU486 administration but mimicked by dexamethasone, indicating a major role for glucocorticoids. Global stress-induced immunosuppression resulted in higher levels of virus replication and dissemination. The higher viral load subsequently led to an earlier disease onset and more severe clinical and histological signs of demyelinating disease. Our results have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of MS, and suggest that stressful events during early infection with an agent capable of inducing demyelination may result in immunosuppression and failure to eliminate the pathogen, which in turn may lead to the development of MS.","Welsh, C Jane; Steelman, Andrew J; Mi, Wentao; Young, Colin R; Dean, Dana D; Storts, Ralph; Welsh, Thomas H; Meagher, Mary W",Neuroimmunomodulation,https://doi.org/10.1159/000258715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20134194/,15
106880,Encapsulation state of messenger RNA inside lipid nanoparticles.,2021-03-24,"While controlled ventilation is most frequently used during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and passive ventilation of the lung synchronously with chest compressions and decompressions might represent a promising alternative approach. One benefit of CPAP during CPR is the reduction of peak airway pressures and therefore a potential enhancement in haemodynamics. We therefore evaluated the tidal volumes and airway pressures achieved during CPAP-CPR. During CPR with the LUCAS™ 2 compression device, a manikin model was passively ventilated at CPAP levels of 5, 10, 20 and 30 hPa with the Boussignac tracheal tube and the ventilators Evita® V500, Medumat® Transport, Oxylator® EMX, Oxylog® 2000, Oxylog® 3000, Primus® and Servo®-i as well as the Wenoll® diver rescue system. Tidal volumes and airway pressures during CPAP-CPR were recorded and analyzed. Tidal volumes during CPAP-CPR were higher than during compression-only CPR without positive airway pressure. The passively generated tidal volumes increased with increasing CPAP levels and were significantly influenced by the ventilators used. During ventilation at 20 hPa CPAP via a tracheal tube, the mean tidal volumes ranged from 125 ml (Medumat®) to 309 ml (Wenoll®) and the peak airway pressures from 23 hPa (Primus®) to 49 hPa (Oxylog® 3000). Transport ventilators generated lower tidal volumes than intensive care ventilators or closed-circuit systems. Peak airway pressures during CPAP-CPR were lower than those during controlled ventilation CPR reported in literature. High peak airway pressures are known to limit the applicability of ventilation via facemask or via supraglottic airway devices and may adversely affect haemodynamics. Hence, the application of ventilators generating high tidal volumes with low peak airway pressures appears desirable during CPAP-CPR. The limited CPAP-CPR capabilities of transport ventilators in our study might be prerequisite for future developments of transport ventilators.","Winkler, Bernd E; Muellenbach, Ralf M; Wurmb, Thomas; Struck, Manuel F; Roewer, Norbert; Kranke, Peter",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-016-9836-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26861639/,15

Then three copolymers (PBDT-Se, PBDSe-T and PBDSe-Se) were obtained by manipulating the connected types and number of selenophene on the conjugated main chains with two 2D fused-ring units and two different π-bridges, respectively. In comparison with PBDT-Se and PBDSe-Se, PBDSe-T with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b¢]diselenophene unit and thiophene π-bridge exhibits the deepest HOMO energy level and the strongest crystallinity in neat films. The PBDSe-T:Y6 blend film exhibits the best absorption complementarity, the most distinctive face-on orientation with proper phase separation, the highest carrier mobilities, and the lowest charge recombination among three blend films. Finally, the PBDSe-T:Y6-based device delivers an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.50%, which is higher than that of PBDT-Se:Y6 and PBDSe-Se:Y6. Moreover, a decent open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.89 V with a remarkable small energy loss of 0.44 eV was achieved for PBDSe-T:Y6.

109314,Laparoscopic isolated caudate lobe resection.,2021-02-22,"INTRODUCTION Uninsured trauma patients are at higher risk of mortality, limited access to postdischarge resources and catastrophic health expenditure. Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE), enacted with the 2014 Affordable Care Act, enables uninsured patients to be screened and acquired emergency Medicaid at the time of hospitalization. We sought to identify factors associated with successful acquisition of HPE insurance at the time of injury, hypothesizing that patients with higher injury severity (ISS>15) would be more likely to be approved for HPE. METHODS We identified Medicaid and uninsured patients aged 18-64 years old with a primary trauma diagnosis (ICD-10) in a large level I trauma center between 2015-2019. We combined trauma registry data with review of electronic medical records, to determine our primary outcome, HPE acquisition. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS Among 2,320 trauma patients, 1,374 (59%) were already enrolled in Medicaid at the time of hospitalization. Among those uninsured at arrival, 386 (40.8%) acquired HPE before discharge, and 560 (59.2%) remained uninsured. HPE patients had higher injury severity score (ISS > 15: 14.8% vs. 5.7%, p < .001), longer median length of stay (LOS) (2 [IQR: 0,5] vs. 0 [0,1] days, p < .001), were more frequently admitted as inpatients (64.5% vs. 33.6%, p < .001) and discharged to post-acute services (11.9% vs. 0.9%, p < .001). Patient, hospital and policy factors contributed to HPE non-approval. In adjusted analyses, Hispanic ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic whites: aOR 1.58, p = .02) and increasing ISS (p ≤ .001) were associated with increased likelihood of HPE approval. CONCLUSION The time of hospitalization due to injury is an underutilized opportunity for intervention, whereby uninsured patients can acquire sustainable insurance coverage. Opportunities to increase HPE acquisition merit further study nationally across trauma centers. As administrative and trauma registries do not capture information to compare HPE and traditional Medicaid patients, prospective insurance data collection would help to identify targets for intervention.

109721,Small changes in PDMMLA structure influence the adsorption behavior of ECM proteins and syndecan-4 on PDMMLA derivative surfaces: Experimental validation by tensiometric surface force measurements.,2020-04-29,"BACKGROUND Endotracheal intubation is commonly performed via direct laryngoscopy (DL). However, in certain patients, DL may be difficult or impossible. The Bonfils Rigid Fiberscope® (BRF) is an alternative intubation device, the design of which raises the question of whether factors that predict difficult DL also predict difficult BRF. We undertook this study to determine which demographic, morphologic, and morphometric factors predict difficult intubation with the BRF. METHODS Four hundred adult patients scheduled for elective surgery were recruited. Patients were excluded if awake intubation, rapid sequence induction, or induction without neuromuscular blocking agents was planned. Data were recorded, including age, sex, weight, height, American Society of Anesthesiologist classification, history of snoring and sleep apnea, Mallampati class, upper lip bite test score, interincisor, thyromental and sternothyroid distances, manubriomental distances in flexion and extension, neck circumference, maximal neck flexion and extension, neck skinfold thickness at the cricoid cartilage, and Cormack and Lehane grade obtained via DL after paralysis was confirmed. Quality of glottic visualization (good or poor), as well as the number of intubation attempts and time to successful intubation with the BRF, was noted. Univariate analyses were performed to evaluate the association between patient characteristics and time required for intubation. Variables that exhibited a significant correlation were included in a multivariate analysis using a standard least squares model. A P < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Glottic visualization with the BRF was good in 396 of 400 (99%) cases. On the first attempt, 390 patients were successfully intubated with the BRF; 6 patients required >1 attempt; 4 patients could not be intubated by using the BRF alone. These 4 patients were intubated by using a combination of DL and BRF (2 patients), DL and a Frova bougie (1 patient), and DL and an endotracheal tube shaped with a semirigid stylet (1 patient). Mean time for successful intubation was 26 ± 13 seconds. Multivariate analysis showed that decreased mouth opening (P = 0.008), increased body mass index (P = 0.011), and higher Cormack and Lehane grade (P = 0.038) predicted longer intubation times, whereas shorter thyromental distance predicted slightly shorter intubation times (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Mouth opening, body mass index, and high Cormack and Lehane grade predict longer intubation times, as with DL. Decreasing thyromental distance predicts slightly shorter intubation times with the BRF, possibly because of a design initially optimized for a pediatric population with receding chins. These findings, along with the high success rate of BRF in this study, and the possibility of further increasing success rates by combining BRF with DL, help define the role of BRF intubation in contemporary airway management.","Nowakowski, Michal; Williams, Stephan; Gallant, Jason; Ruel, Monique; Robitaille, Arnaud",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000001258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27028774/,15

Inflammation is increasingly considered to be a pathologic mediator of these commonly co-occurring diseases. A growing number of preclinical and clinical studies support the inflammatory hypothesis, but clinical trials to confirm the therapeutic potential to target inflammation to treat or prevent cardiometabolic conditions are still ongoing. There are multiple inflammatory signaling pathways. Regulation is complex, with substantial crosstalk across these multiple pathways. The activity of select pathways may be differentially regulated in different tissues. Pharmacologic approaches to diabetes management may have direct or indirect antiinflammatory effects, the latter potentially attributable to an improved metabolic state. Conversely, some antiinflammatory approaches may affect glucose metabolism and cardiovascular health. To date, clinical trials suggest that targeting one portion of the inflammatory cascade may differentially affect dysglycemia and atherothrombosis. Understanding the underlying biological processes may contribute to the development of safe and effective therapies, although a single approach may not be sufficient for optimal management of both metabolic and athrothrombotic disease states.","Goldfine, Allison B; Shoelson, Steven E",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci88884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28045401/,15
109944,Nanoscale Drug Delivery Systems for Glaucoma: Experimental and In Silico Advances.,2020-09-22,"PURPOSE Radiolabelled Affibody molecules have demonstrated a potential for visualization of tumour-associated molecular targets. Affibody molecules (7 kDa) are composed of three alpha-helices. Recently, a smaller two-helix variant of Affibody molecules (5.1 kDa) was developed. The aim of this study was to compare two- and three-helix HER2-targeting Affibody molecules directly in vivo. METHODS The three-helix Affibody molecule ABY-002 and the two-helix Affibody molecule PEP09239 were labelled with (111)In at the N-termini via DOTA chelator. Tumour-targeting properties were directly compared at 1 and 4 h after injection in mice bearing SKOV-3 xenografts with high HER2 expression and LS174T xenografts with low HER2 expression. RESULTS The dissociation constants (K(D)) for HER2 binding were 78 pM for the three-helix Affibody molecule and 2.1 nM for the two-helix Affibody molecule. (111)In-PEP09239 cleared more rapidly from the blood. In xenografts with high HER2 expression, the uptake of (111)In-ABY-002 was significantly higher than that of (111)In-PEP09239. The tumour-to-blood ratio was higher for (111)In-PEP09239 at 4 h after injection, while there was no significant difference in other tumour-to-organ ratios. The tumour uptake of (111)In-ABY-002 was eightfold higher than that of (111)In-PEP09239 in xenografts with low expression. Tumour-to-blood ratios were equal in this case, but other tumour-to-organ ratios were appreciably higher for the three-helix variant. CONCLUSION For tumours with high HER2 expression, two-helix HER2-targeting Affibody molecules can provide higher tumour-to-blood ratio at the cost of lower tumour uptake. In the case of low expression, both tumour uptake and tumour-to-organ ratios are appreciably higher for three-helix than for two-helix HER2-targeting Affibody molecules.","Rosik, Daniel; Orlova, Anna; Malmberg, Jennie; Altai, Mohamed; Varasteh, Zohreh; Sandström, Mattias; Karlström, Amelie Eriksson; Tolmachev, Vladimir",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-011-2016-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22170322/,15

In Brazil, Massachusetts type (Mass), used as a live vaccine, and local field Brazilian variants (genotypes; BR) predominate in the commercial poultry flocks. This study describes the development and validation of two real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) for the specific detection of Mass and BR genotypes in allantoic fluids and clinical samples. Genotype-specific primers, combined with a generic probe targeted to the S1 gene, originated Mass RT-qPCR and BR RT-qPCR-specific assays. Analytical sensitivity and linearity of these assays were determined in comparison with an IBV generic real-time RT-PCR based on the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR RT-qPCR). Mass RT-qPCR detected five Mass field isolates, three vaccine samples, and one coinfected sample (BR and Mass) while BR RT-qPCR detected 16 BR field isolates. Both assays were linear (R(2) > 0.98), reproducible, and as sensitive as the classical 5'UTR RT-qPCR used to detect IBV. In the analysis of 141 IBV clinical samples, 8 were positive for Mass RT-qPCR, 76 for BR RT-qPCR, and 2 for both assays. In the remaining 55 samples, 25 were positive only for 5'UTR RT-qPCR and 30 were negative for the three assays. In conclusion, both assays were able to detect Mass and BR genotypes, allowing rapid and easy IBV molecular typing from allantoic fluids and clinical samples.","Fraga, Aline Padilha de; Ikuta, Nilo; Fonseca, André Salvador Kazantzi; Spilki, Fernando Rosado; Balestrin, Eder; Rodrigues, Carolina Dias; Canal, Cláudio Wageck; Lunge, Vagner Ricardo",Avian diseases,https://doi.org/10.1637/11262-081815-regr.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26953939/,15

Selecting PRO-CTCAE™ items for monitoring symptomatic adverse events is hindered by the heterogeneity and complexity of IrAEs, and no standardised selection process exists. We aimed to reach expert consensus on the PRO-CTCAE™ symptom terms relevant for cancer patients receiving ICIs and to gather preliminary expert opinions about additional symptom terms reflecting ICI symptomatic toxicities. Additionally, we gathered expert consensus about a core set of priority symptom terms for prospective surveillance and monitoring. DESIGN This Delphi study involved an international panel of experts (n = 6 physicians; n = 3 nurses, n = 1 psychiatrist and n = 1 patient advocates). Experts prioritised the relevance and importance of symptom terms to monitor in patients treated with ICIs. RESULTS Experts reached a consensus on the relevance of all (n = 80) PRO-CTCAE™ Symptom Terms. Consensus on the importance of these symptom terms for prospective monitoring in patients receiving ICIs was reached for 81% (n = 65) of these terms. Additional symptoms terms (n = 56) were identified, with a consensus that 84% (47/56) of these additional symptom terms should also be considered when monitoring symptomatic IrAEs. CONCLUSION This study identified a prioritised list of symptom terms for prospective surveillance for symptomatic IrAEs in patients receiving ICI treatment. Our results indicate the need to strengthen the validity of PRO measures used to monitor patients receiving ICIs. While these results provided some support for the content validity of the PRO CTCAE™ and resulted in a preliminary set of salient symptomatic adverse events related to the use of ICIs, broader international agreement and patient involvement are needed to further validate our initial findings.","Da Silva Lopes, André Manuel; Colomer-Lahiguera, Sara; Mederos Alfonso, Nuria; Aedo-Lopez, Veronica; Spurrier-Bernard, Gilliosa; Tolstrup, Lærke Kjær; Pappot, Helle; Aspeslagh, Sandrine; Rogiers, Anne; Neyns, Bart; Haanen, John B; Mitchell, Sandra A; Addeo, Alfredo; Michielin, Olivier; Eicher, Manuela",European journal of cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2021.08.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34536946/,15

Radiology-performed ultrasound is the diagnostic study of choice but may lead to delays due to lack of availability. Point-of-care ultrasound for intussusception (POCUS-I) studies have shown excellent accuracy and reduced lengths of stay, but there are limited POCUS-I training materials for pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) providers. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study assessing PEM physicians undergoing a primarily Web-based POCUS-I curriculum. We developed the POCUS-I curriculum using Kern's six-step model. The curriculum included a Web-based module and a brief, hands-on practice that was developed with a board-certified pediatric radiologist. POCUS-I technical skill, knowledge, and confidence were determined by a direct observation checklist, multiple-choice test, and a self-reported Likert-scale survey, respectively. We assessed participants immediately pre- and postcourse as well as 3 months later to assess for retention of skill, knowledge, and confidence. Results A total of 17 of 17 eligible PEM physicians at a single institution participated in the study. For the direct observation skills test, participants scored well after the course with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) score of 20 of 22 (20-21) and maintained high scores even after 3 months (20 [20-21]). On the written knowledge test, there was significant improvement from 57.4% (95% CI = 49.8 to 65.2) to 75.3% (95% CI = 68.1 to 81.6; p < 0.001) and this improvement was maintained at 3 months at 81.2% (95% CI = 74.5 to 86.8). Physicians also demonstrated improved confidence with POCUS-I after exposure to the curriculum, with 5.9% reporting somewhat or very confident prior to the course to 76.5% both after the course and after 3 months (p < 0.001). Conclusion After a primarily Web-based curriculum for POCUS-I, PEM physicians performed well in technical skill in POCUS-I and showed improvement in knowledge and confidence, all of which were maintained over 3 months.","Lin-Martore, Margaret; Olvera, Michael P; Kornblith, Aaron E; Zapala, Matthew; Addo, Newton; Lin, Michelle; Werner, Heidi C",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34041433/,15

This exchange has profound effects on the nature and rapidity of virus and host evolution. Recombination between dsDNA viruses is common, as is genetic exchange between dsDNA viruses or retroviruses and host genomes. Recombination between RNA virus genomes is also well known. In contrast, genetic exchange across viral kingdoms, for instance between nonretroviral RNA viruses or ssDNA viruses and host genomes or between RNA and DNA viruses, was previously thought to be practically nonexistent. However, there is now growing evidence for both RNA and ssDNA viruses recombining with host dsDNA genomes and, more surprisingly, RNA virus genes recombining with ssDNA virus genomes. Mechanisms are still unclear, but this deep recombination greatly expands the breadth of virus evolution and confounds virus taxonomy.","Stedman, Kenneth M",Annual review of virology,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-virology-100114-055127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26958913/,15

However, past studies primarily targeted PSIs that are highly frequent in children's language input. In this paper, we report an experimental investigation on children's comprehension of two NPIs and two PPIs in German. Based on corpus data indicating that the four tested PSIs are present in child-directed speech but rare in young children's utterances, we conducted an auditory rating task with adults and 11- to 12-year-old children. The results demonstrate that, even at 11-12 years of age, children do not yet show a completely target-like comprehension of the investigated PSIs. While they are adult-like in their responses to one of the tested NPIs, their responses did not demonstrate a categorical distinction between licensed and unlicensed PSI uses for the other tested expressions. The effect was led by a higher acceptance of sentences containing unlicensed PSIs, indicating a lack of awareness for their distributional restrictions. The results of our study pose new questions for the developmental time scale of the acquisition of polarity items.","Schwab, Juliane; Liu, Mingya; Mueller, Jutta L",Journal of psycholinguistic research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10936-021-09801-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34424452/,15

BACKGROUND Morphine analgesia may reduce the absorption of co-prescribed P2Y12 antagonists attenuating platelet inhibition. The impact of periprocedural intravenous morphine on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing PCI for STEMI is not well defined. METHODS Analysis of the electronic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov for association of peri-PCI intravenous morphine use with in-hospital or 30-day myocardial infarction (MI) (primary outcome) and in-hospital or 30-day mortality. RESULTS A total of 11 studies were included for systematic review. One study was a randomized controlled trial, 10 were observational studies. Five studies including 3,748 patients were included in meta-analysis of in-hospital or 30-day MI. Within this group, patients were treated concurrently with ticagrelor (n = 2,239), clopidogrel (n = 1,256) and prasugrel (n = 253). There was no significant association of in-hospital or 30-day MI with intravenous morphine (odds ratio 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-4.09; I2 0%). Across seven studies and 5,800 patients, no increased risk of mortality at the same composite time endpoint was evident (odds ratio 0.70; 95% CI 0.40-1.23; I2 19%). CONCLUSIONS Periprocedural intravenous morphine administration was not associated with adverse short-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI. Further randomized trial data are needed to evaluate the pharmacologic interaction between morphine and P2Y12 antagonists with clinical outcomes.","Batchelor, Riley; Liu, David Hongwei; Bloom, Jason; Noaman, Samer; Chan, William",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.28561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654491/,15

We designed a new high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for inhibitors of infection based on envelope glycoprotein pseudotypes. The assay simulates multicycle replication and thus identifies inhibitors that target several stages of the viral life cycle, but it still can be carried out under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. These features permit a screen for antivirals for emerging viruses and select agents that otherwise would require BSL-4 HTS facilities. The screening of a small compound library identified several effective molecules, including the well-known compound chloroquine, as highly active inhibitors of pseudotyped virus infection. Chloroquine inhibited infection with live HeV and NiV at a concentration of 1 microM in vitro (50% inhibitory concentration, 2 microM), which is less than the plasma concentrations present in humans receiving chloroquine treatment for malaria. The mechanism for chloroquine's antiviral action likely is the inhibition of cathepsin L, a cellular enzyme that is essential for the processing of the viral fusion glycoprotein and the maturation of newly budding virions. Without this processing step, virions are not infectious. The identification of a compound that inhibits a known cellular target that is important for viral maturation but that had not previously been shown to have antiviral activity for henipaviruses highlights the validity of this new screening assay. Given the established safety profile and broad experience with chloroquine in humans, the results described here provide an option for treating individuals infected by these deadly viruses.","Porotto, Matteo; Orefice, Gianmarco; Yokoyama, Christine C; Mungall, Bruce A; Realubit, Ronald; Sganga, Michael L; Aljofan, Mohamad; Whitt, Michael; Glickman, Fraser; Moscona, Anne",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00164-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19264786/,15

BACKGROUND An increasing percentage of patients with complex IA occlusive disease are treated with an endovascular approach, but the outcomes of IA-ISR have not been well described. METHODS We analyzed all endovascular procedures for treatment of IA-ISR performed at our institution between July 2006-December 2010. The primary outcome was primary patency, defined as <50% stenosis as assessed by clinical examination and duplex ultrasonography (DUS). RESULTS Forty-one lesions in 24 patients who underwent repeated endovascular intervention for treatment of IA-ISR. Most lesions were unilateral and involved the common IA (66%). The mean length of ISR was 30.1 ± 14.1 mm with type I (focal) and II (diffuse) ISR occurring with the greatest frequency (34% and 39%, respectively). All patients underwent balloon angioplasty; adjunctive stenting zwas performed in 27 (66%) of the lesions. Type II ISR lesions more frequently required stenting (13/16 lesions, P = 0.02 compared with other patterns of ISR). Procedural success was 100% with a mean gain of 0.13 in the ankle-brachial index (P = 0.001). The 6- and 12-month primary patency rates were 96% and 82%, respectively. The 12-month primary-assisted patency rate was 90% with clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) in three patients. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of IA-ISR using an approach of balloon angioplasty followed by selective stenting is associated with high-patency rates and low rates of TLR at 1 year.","Javed, Usman; Balwanz, Christopher R; Armstrong, Ehrin J; Yeo, Khung-Keong; Singh, Gagan D; Singh, Satinder; Anderson, David; Westin, Gregory G; Pevec, William C; Laird, John R",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.24975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23613343/,15

MGAT1 is the GlcNAc-transferase that initiates complex and hybrid N-glycan synthesis. We show here that Drosophila MGAT1 was also inhibited by MGAT4D-L in S2 cells. In mammalian cells, expression of MGAT4D-L causes the substrate of MGAT1 (Man5GlcNAc2Asn) to accumulate on glycoproteins, a change that is detected by the lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA). Using GNA binding as an assay for the inhibition of MGAT1 in MGAT4D-L transfectants, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to determine requirements for MGAT1 inhibition. Deletion of 25 aa from the C-terminus inactivated MGAT4D-L, but deletion of 20 aa did not. Conversion of the five key amino acids (PSLFQ) to Ala, or deletion of PSLFQ in the context of full length MGAT4D-L, also inactivated MGAT1 inhibitory activity. Nevertheless, mutant, inactive MGAT4D-L interacted with MGAT1 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The PSLFQ sequence also occurs in MGAT4A and MGAT4B GlcNAc-transferases. However, neither inhibited MGAT1 in transfected CHO cells. MGAT4D-L inhibitory activity could be partially transferred by attaching PSLFQ or the 25 aa C-terminus of MGAT4D-L to the C-terminus of MGAT1. Mutation of each aa in PSLFQ to Ala identified both Leu and Phe as independently essential for MGAT4D-L activity. Thus, replacement of either Leu395 or Phe396 with Ala led to inactivation of MGAT4D-L inhibitory activity. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of inhibition of MGAT1 by MGAT4D-L, and for the development of small molecule inhibitors of MGAT1.","Akintayo, Ayodele; Mayoral, Joshua; Asada, Masahiro; Tang, Jian; Sundaram, Subha; Stanley, Pamela",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.014784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763972/,15

RESULTS Median false positive response rate for GearVision was 7% (4-12) while for HFA it was 0% (0-6, P<0.001). Median false negative response rate was similar for both tests. 84 eyes with reliable HFA and GearVision results were included in the final analysis. Median threshold sensitivity of all 52 points on HFA was 29.1▒dB (26.5, 30.7) and for GearVision was 30.6▒dB (29.1, 32.6; P<0.001). Mean difference (95% limits of agreement, LoA) in total threshold sensitivity between HFA and GearVision was -1.9▒dB (-5, 1). The 95% LoA were fairly narrow (-8 to 2▒dB) across the 6 Garway-Heath sectors. Most participants preferred to perform GearVision (68.2%) if required to repeat perimetry compared to HFA (20.6%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS There was fairly good agreement between the threshold sensitives of GearVision and HFA. GearVision was also preferred by most patients and could potentially supplement HFA as a portable or home perimeter.","Pradhan, Zia Sultan; Sircar, Tushar; Agrawal, Harshit; Rao, Harsha Laxmana; Bopardikar, Ajit; Devi, Sathi; Tiwari, Vijay N",Journal of glaucoma,https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33596021/,15

We examined the pandemic's impact on an established longitudinal cohort of TGNB individuals (N = 208) by administering an online survey between March-June 2020. We used multivariable linear regression to examine reduced LGBTQ/TGNB community support and disruptions in gender-affirming health care as predictors of psychological distress during the pandemic. We found that the pandemic exacerbated ongoing mental health disparities for TGNB individuals. Furthermore, reduced LGBTQ/TGNB support was associated with increased psychological distress during the pandemic. Interruption and/or delay in gender-affirming health care was not associated with increased psychological distress during the pandemic. Special attention is needed to address the unique ways in which TGNB individuals were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes increasing access to LGBTQ/TGNB community support and addressing long-standing health disparities.","Kidd, Jeremy D; Jackman, Kasey B; Barucco, Renato; Dworkin, Jordan D; Dolezal, Curtis; Navalta, Theresa V; Belloir, Joseph; Bockting, Walter O",Journal of homosexuality,https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2020.1868185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33502286/,15
118776,CRISPR Enzyme Kinetics for Molecular Diagnostics.,2021-05-12,"BACKGROUND Bounce rope-skip holds immense scope as an aerobic exercise in space and time constrained urban setting with additional constraints placed by pandemic situations such as Covid 19, wherein adherence to commonly performed weight-bearing, aerobic activities like walking and running is a challenge. Limited knowledge informing biomechanical demands and misconceptions about knee joint loading, confines safe application of bounce rope-skip in health promotion. Thus, present study aimed to explore kinematics and lower-extremity joint loading during rope-skipping compared to walking and running. METHODS Following ethical approval, 3D motion analysis of bounce rope-skip, walk and run was captured from 22 healthy female participants aged 18-25yr using 12-camera Vicon system and 2AMTI force plates. Three trials for bounce rope-skip were recorded with five skip-jumps on force-plates at a cadence of 105 skips/min. Mid-skip, mid-gait and mid-run data were averaged to compute kinetic and kinematic variables for hip, knee and ankle during loading/initial contact, take-off/push-off and flight/mid-swing phases of rope-skip, walk and run. RESULT Average time of one rope-skip cycle was 1.2sec; mean foot contact time was 0.55sec and flight time was 0.65sec. In one bounce rope-skip cycle, hip motion ranged between 13.4o-35.3oflexion; knee between 13.6 o-67.9° flexion and ankle between 34.5odorsiflexion to-13.40plantarflexion. Vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) during rope-skip (landing-phase) was lower compared to run; however, it was higher than walk (p < 0.001). In coronal plane, peak hip and knee adductor moment during rope-skip were lower compared to run and higher than walk (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Bounce rope-skip generated low lower extremity joint loading compared to run; supporting its prescription as a hip and knee joint-protective aerobic weight-bearing exercise for health promotion in young adults.","Mullerpatan, Rajani; Shetty, Triveni; Singh, Yuvraj; Agarwal, Bela",Journal of bodywork and movement therapies,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbmt.2020.12.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33992227/,15

In spite of this incredible success of perovskite nanocrystals (NCs), the development of perovskite NCs is still in its infancy, and the production of high-quality ultrathin perovskite nanostructures has been a hot topic in the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Herein, we demonstrate that ultrathin CsPbBr3 perovskite nanosheets (NSs) can be obtained by a simple mixing of precursor-ligand complexes under ambient conditions. It was found that the formation of NSs is ascribed to the stepwise self-assembly of the initially formed different types of ultrathin nanostructures. Due to the disappearance of grain boundaries and protection of branched ligands, these NSs exhibit enhanced optical properties compared to other types of samples. This direct synthesis method opens up a promising road for the synthesis of ultrathin NSs and guides the fabrication of other ultrathin nanostructures.","Ji, Yongqiang; Wang, Minqiang; Yang, Zhi; Qiu, Hengwei; Wang, Hui; Padhiar, Muhammad Amin; Zhou, Yun; Dang, Jialin; Gaponenko, Nikolai V; Bhatti, Arshad Saleem",Dalton transactions,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0dt04203j; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594997/,15
119644,Mapping Viral Susceptibility Loci in Mice.,2019,"INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to examine whether telehealth is as safe and effective as traditional office visits in assessing and treating patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19. METHODS In this retrospective cross-sectional study, the primary outcome was any 14-day related healthcare follow-up event(s). Secondary outcomes were the type of 14-day related follow-up event including hospital admission, emergency department visit, office visit, telehealth visit and/or multiple follow-up visits. Individual visit types were identified due to the significant difference between a hospital admission and an office visit. Logistic regressions were done using the predictors of visit type, age, gender and comorbidities and the primary outcome variable of a related follow-up visit and then by follow-up type: hospital admission, emergency department visit or office visit. RESULTS Of 1305 visits, median age was 42.3 years and 65.8% were female. Traditional office visits accounted for 741 (56.8%) of initial visits, while 564 (43.2%) visits occurred via telehealth. One hundred and forty-six (25.9%) of the telehealth visits resulted in a 14-day related healthcare follow-up visit versus 161 (21.7%) of the office visits (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% CI 0.94-1.58). DISCUSSION There was no significant difference in related follow-ups of initial telehealth visits compared to initial office visits including no significant difference in hospital admission or emergency department visits. These findings suggest that based on follow up healthcare utilization, telehealth may be a safe and effective option in assessing and treating patients with respiratory symptoms as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","Phillips, J Cole; Lord, Richard W; Davis, Stephen W; Burton, Amanda A; Kirk, Julienne K",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x21990197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33525950/,15

Its prevalence and fatality rate are rapidly increasing but the medication options are still limited for this perilous disease. The emergent outbreak of COVID-19 triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps propagating globally. The present scenario has emphasized the requirement for therapeutic opportunities to relive and overcome this latest pandemic. Despite the fact, the deteriorating developments of COVID-19, there is no drug certified to have considerable effects in the medical treatment for COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 pandemic requests for the rapid testing of new treatment approaches. Based on the evidence, hydroxychloroquine is the first medicine opted for the treatment of disease. Umifenovir, remdesivir, and fevipiravir are deemed the most hopeful antiviral agent by improving the health of infected patients. The dexamethasone is a first known steroid medicine that can save the lives of seriously ill patients, and it is shown in a randomized clinical trial by the United Kingdom that it reduced the death rate in COVID-19 patients. The current review recapitulates the existing evidence of possible therapeutic drugs, peptides, humanized antibodies, convulsant plasma, and vaccination that has revealed potential in fighting COVID-19 infections. Many randomized and controlled clinical trials are taking place to further validate these agent's safety and effectiveness in curing COVID-19.","Trivedi, N; Verma, A; Kumar, D",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202012_24057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336780/,15

The resulting electrochemical biosensor was validated towards glucose oxidation in real samples and further electrochemical measurement associated with the generated H2O2. The electrochemical biosensor showed an excellent sensitivity (42.7 μA mM-1 cm-2), limit of detection (7.6 μM), linear range (20 μM-2.3 mM), and good selectivity towards glucose determination. Furthermore, and most importantly, the detection of glucose was performed at a low potential (0.2 V vs. Ag). The high performance of the electrochemical biosensor was explained through surface exploration using field emission SEM, XPS, and impedance measurements. The electrochemical biosensor was successfully applied to glucose quantification in several real samples (commercial juices and a plant cell culture medium), exhibiting a high accuracy when compared with a classical spectrophotometric method. This electrochemical biosensor can be easily prepared and opens up a good alternative in the development of new sensitive glucose sensors.","Jiménez-Fiérrez, Francisco; González-Sánchez, María Isabel; Jiménez-Pérez, Rebeca; Iniesta, Jesús; Valero, Edelmira",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20164489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796638/,15

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the PED in a multicenter cohort. METHODS Five major academic institutions in the United States provided data on patient demographics, aneurysm features, and treatment characteristics of consecutive patients with aneurysms ≤ 7 mm treated with a PED between 2009 and 2015. Radiographic outcome was assessed with digital subtraction angiography. Clinical outcome was measured with the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS The cumulative number of aneurysms ≤ 7 mm treated with PED at the 5 institutions was 149 in 117 patients (age, 54 years [range, 29-87 years]; male to female, 1-5.9). Aneurysms were most commonly located in the paraophthalmic segment (67.1%) of the internal carotid artery. Radiographic outcome at last follow-up was available for 123 aneurysms (82.6%), with a complete occlusion rate of 87%. Thromboembolic and symptomatic procedural complications occurred in 8.7% and 6% of the aneurysms treated, respectively. There was 1 mortality (0.9%) unrelated to the PED procedure. Multivariable logistic regression identified size < 4 mm, balloon angioplasty to open the device, and simultaneous treatment of multiple aneurysms as predictors of procedural complications. Good clinical outcome was achieved in 96% of electively treated patients. CONCLUSION In the largest series on PED for small aneurysms to date, data suggest that treatment with the flow-diverting PED is safe and efficacious, with complication rates comparable to those for traditional endovascular techniques.","Griessenauer, Christoph J; Ogilvy, Christopher S; Foreman, Paul M; Chua, Michelle H; Harrigan, Mark R; He, Lucy; Fusco, Matthew R; Mocco, J D; Stapleton, Christopher J; Patel, Aman B; Sonig, Ashish; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Thomas, Ajith J",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000001377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27489165/,15

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, severity, and management of asthma in adolescents aged 13-14 years. This cross-sectional study, which was part of the Global Asthma Network (GAN) 2020 survey, was conducted in early 2020 in Yazd, Iran. A total of 48 schools in Yazd city were selected by cluster sampling. In this study, 5141 students, including 3069 (59.7%) females and 2072 (40.3%) males participated. Prevalence of ever and current wheezing was 19% and 9% respectively. The former was significantly higher in males than females (p<0.001). About 2% of the participants, which was 22.1% of students with current wheezing, had severe asthma. The prevalence of severe asthma was significantly higher in males (p=0.026). Our results showed that 4.8% of students had confirmed asthma by a doctor, significantly predominant in males (p<0.001).

121175,Resolving trained immunity with systems biology.,2021-02-11,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the use of a laparoscopic specimen retrieval pouch for removal of intact or fragmented cystic calculi from standing horses. DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 8 horses (5 geldings and 3 mares) with cystic calculi. PROCEDURES Physical examination and cystoscopic, ultrasonographic, and hematologic evaluations of urinary tract function were performed for each horse. A diagnosis of cystic calculus was made on the basis of results of cystoscopy and ultrasonography. Concurrent urolithiasis or other urinary tract abnormalities identified during preoperative evaluation were recorded. Horses were sedated and placed in standing stocks, and the perineum was aseptically prepared. Direct access to the urinary bladder was gained in geldings via perineal urethrotomy or in mares by a transurethral approach. Calculi were visualized endoscopically, manipulated into the retrieval pouch, and removed intact or fragmented (for larger calculi). RESULTS For 4 geldings and 1 mare, fragmentation was necessary to facilitate calculus removal. Mean duration of surgery was 125 minutes, and trauma to the urinary bladder and urethra was limited to areas of hyperemia and submucosal petechiation. No postoperative complications were encountered for any horse. When lithotripsy was required, the retrieval pouch provided an effective means of stabilizing calculi and containing the fragments for removal. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Use of the laparoscopic specimen retrieval pouch was an effective, minimally traumatic method for retrieving cystic calculi from standing horses. The pouch protected the urinary bladder and urethra from trauma during calculus removal and allowed for stabilization, containment, and fragmentation of calculi when necessary.","Katzman, Scott A; Vaughan, Betsy; Nieto, Jorge E; Galuppo, Larry D",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.249.3.304; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27439348/,15

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3β) is a prominent mediator of the inflammatory response, and high GSK-3 activity is associated with various heart diseases. We investigated the regulatory mechanisms of GSK-3β in activation of the nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in a rat model with successful induction of MI on days 2-28. An in vitro investigation was performed using newborn rat/human cardiomyocytes and fibroblast cultures under typical inflammasome stimulation and hypoxia treatment. GSK-3β inhibition markedly improved myocardial dysfunction and prevented remodeling, with parallel reduction in the parameters of NLRP3 inflammasome activation after MI. GSK-3β inhibition reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in cardiac fibroblasts, but not in cardiomyocytes. GSK-3β's interaction with activating signal cointegrator (ASC) as well as GSK-3β inhibition reduced ASC phosphorylation and oligomerization at the tissues and cellular levels. Taken together, these data show that GSK-3β directly mediates NLRP3 inflammasome activation, causing cardiac dysfunction in MI.","Wang, Shuhui; Su, Xueling; Xu, Lina; Chang, Cheng; Yao, Yu; Komal, Sumra; Cha, Xuexiang; Zang, Mingxi; Ouyang, Xinshou; Zhang, Lirong; Han, Shengna",Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.09.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991876/,15

The usefulness of this function is investigated in this preliminary report. METHODS The volume data of the extracted tumor with a virtual ablative margin were created on an image-processing workstation, and transported into a US unit equipped with a CT/MR-US fusion imaging system. After the positional registration of US and transported images, the extracted tumor with an ablative margin could be overlaid on US. In RFA, using this function, an electrode was inserted targeting the overlaid tumor with an ablative safety margin of 5 mm on US, and the treatment effect was evaluated by dynamic CT. Treatment results of 23 consecutive hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) that underwent RFA using this function were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Complete tumor ablation was achieved in 22 (95.7%) and 1 (4.3%) HCCs in 1 and 2 treatment sessions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Due to the visualization of an extracted tumor with an ablative safety margin on a US image, even during and after ablation, this function is useful for treatment planning and guidance of RFA.","Makino, Yuki; Imai, Yasuharu; Igura, Takumi; Kogita, Sachiyo; Sawai, Yoshiyuki; Fukuda, Kazuto; Hori, Masatoshi; Kudo, Masatoshi; Murakami, Takamichi",Digestive diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000355257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24281025/,15

123385,New Methods in Tissue Engineering: Improved Models for Viral Infection.,2014,"The recognition of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes is controlled by host immune cells, which are equipped with many innate immunity receptors, such as Toll-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and immunoglobulin-like receptors. Our studies indicate that the immune modulating properties of many herbal drugs, for instance, the medicinal fungus Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) and Cordyceps sinensis, could be attributed to their polysaccharide components. These polysaccharides specifically interact with and activate surface receptors involved in innate immunity. However, due to the complexity of polysaccharides and their various sources from medicinal fungi, quantitative analysis of medicinal polysaccharide extracts with regard to their functions represents a major challenge. To profile carbohydrate-immune receptor interactions, the extracellular domains of 17 receptors were cloned as Fc-fusion proteins, such that their interactions with immobilized polysaccharides could be probed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results show that several innate immune receptors, including Dectin-1, DC-SIGN, Langerin, Kupffer cell receptor, macrophage mannose receptor, TLR2, and TLR4, interact with the polysaccharide extracts from G. lucidum (GLPS). This analysis revealed distinct polysaccharide profiles from different sources of medicinal fungi, and the innate immune receptor-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay described here can serve as a high-throughput profiling method for the characterization and quality control of medicinal polysaccharides. It also provides a means to dissect the molecular mechanism of medicinal polysaccharide-induced immunomodulation events.","Hsu, Tsui-Ling; Cheng, Shih-Chin; Yang, Wen-Bin; Chin, See-Wen; Chen, Bo-Hua; Huang, Ming-Ting; Hsieh, Shie-Liang; Wong, Chi-Huey",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m109.065961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19837675/,15

124418,"Vaccines for neglected, emerging and re-emerging diseases.",2020-11-26,"This narrative review examines current academic literature on the mental health of Filipino seafarers working internationally, including the mental health effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Framed within a rights-based approach, it aims to identify and analyse emerging themes on Filipino seafarers' mental health literature to understand what these studies potentially mean for the improvement of seafarers' education on mental health. Based on a broad selection criteria, 28 eligible papers demonstrate collectively three key findings: firstly, there is paucity in published research on seafarers' mental health; secondly, the majority of published studies are associated with a recent piracy crisis, where a significant number of mariners were attacked, taken as hostages, or killed; thirdly, three key areas emerged under which research on Filipino seafarers' mental health can be organized: the medical repatriation of seafarers, system of care for the mental health of seafarers including the diagnostic standards used, and seafarers' experiences and conceptions of mental health including the mental health effects of COVID-19. Though the bulk of the current understanding of the mental health problems is associated with piracy, several risk factors for which the quality of quantitative and qualitative evidence are patchy. The few sources of primary data to date lack focus on mental health needs which makes it difficult to grasp the extent of the problem. Developing policies and programmes for the promotion of mental health through mental health education among seafarers is important for a couple of reasons. Seafaring remains a dangerous and socially isolating occupation where work-related accidents are likely and will be potentially traumatic to mariners. Research on occupational stressors is increasingly providing evidence of their contributions to poor mental health outcomes among seafarers. Thus, mental health education of seafarers in the context of their work is important for proactive training and development.","Abila, Sanley Salvacion; Acejo, Iris Lavalle",International maritime health,https://doi.org/10.5603/imh.2021.0035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604987/,15
125402,Cysteine modification by ebselen reduces the stability and cellular levels of 14-3-3 proteins.,2021-05-24,"INTRODUCTION Informed consent is essential to clinical research, though obtaining informed consent for participation in research for emergency conditions is challenging. Adapted consent methods include consent from a substitute-decision maker, deferral of consent and waiver of consent. A novel approach is to use advanced consent, where a potential participant provides consent in the present in the event that they become eligible for enrolment into a future study. This scoping review will map and synthesise the literature on the use of advanced consent for participation and enrolment in randomised control trials for emergency conditions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Guided by Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review methodology framework, we will search electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Register of Clinical Trials), the grey literature sources and reference lists of relevant studies. Eligible studies will include English language articles that discuss, examine or employ the use of advanced consent for enrolment in randomised control trials, specifically related to emergency conditions or emergency treatment. Diverse types of articles will be eligible for inclusion, including peer-reviewed qualitative and quantitative studies such as randomised control trials, observational studies, surveys, systematic reviews, as well as narrative reviews and ethics papers. Studies will be screened by two independent reviewers to determine eligibility for inclusion. Data on bibliographic information, study characteristics and methodology, and reported results, specifically author disposition, will be extracted and described using qualitative analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Formal ethics review is not required as primary data will not be collected. The findings of this study will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication. The findings of this study will help identify knowledge gaps that may guide areas for future research and may aid in the design of future clinical trials using advanced consent.","Niznick, Naomi; Lun, Ronda; Dewar, Brian; Dowlatshahi, Dar; Shamy, Michel",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33067291/,15

Yet, there are no prospective studies comparing weaning strategies for liberation from ECMO. RESEARCH QUESTION Is a protocolized daily assessment of readiness to liberate from VV-ECMO safe and feasible? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a prospective, single-arm, safety and feasibility study of a protocol for daily assessment of readiness to liberate from VV-ECMO among consecutive adult patients receiving VV-ECMO across four intensive care units at a single center between June 20, 2020 and November 24, 2020. The ECMO-free protocol included three-phases: 1) the safety screen, 2) non-ECMO fraction of inspired oxygen titration, and 3) the ECMO-free trial. Enrollment, interventions, and data collection were performed prospectively by trained study staff. RESULTS Twenty-six patients received the ECMO-free protocol on 385 patient-days. The safety screen was passed during a total of 59 ECMO-free daily assessments (15.3%) among 20 patients. Every passed safety screen proceeded to an ECMO-free trial. There were 28 (47.5%) passed ECMO-free trials among 16 patients (61.5%). There were no missed safety screens, protocol deviations, or adverse events. Of the 16 patients who passed an ECMO-free trial, 14 (87.5%) were decannulated. Among decannulated patients, 12 (85.7%) were decannulated on the same day as a passed ECMO-free trial, 6 (42.9%) were decannulated on the first day that they passed an ECMO-free trial, and 6 (42.9%) passed an ECMO-free trial at least twice consecutively before decannulation. The median time from first passed ECMO-free trial to decannulation was 2 days (IQR, 0 to 3 days). INTERPRETATIONS The ECMO-free protocol is feasible and may identify patients for decannulation earlier than gradual approaches to weaning.","Gannon, Whitney D; Stokes, John W; Bloom, Sarah; Sherrill, Wren; Bacchetta, Matthew; Rice, Todd W; Semler, Matthew W; Casey, Jonathan D",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.05.066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34166644/,15

Monthly data were retrospectively reviewed from January 2004 to December 2010. Use of antimicrobials and alcohol-based hand cleaner were separately regressed against the incidences of HAIs and HA-MRSA infections. Infection incidence was expressed as persons per 1000 patient days (PDs), monthly use of i.v. antibiotics was expressed as defined daily doses per 1000 PDs and monthly alcohol-based hand cleaner use was expressed as bottle per 1000 PDs. Multivariate analysis indicated that use of hand cleaner was associated with reduced incidence of HAIs (P=0.0001) and HA-MRSA infections (P<0.0001). Time-series analysis indicated that increased use of hand cleaner was significantly associated with significant decreases in the incidences of HAIs and HA-MRSA infections. Total antibiotic use had no significant effect on HAIs, but was associated with more HA-MRSA infections. In addition, the use of J01CR01 antibiotics (combinations of penicillins, including β-lactamase inhibitors) in particular was correlated with significantly increased incidence of HA-MRSA infections. Our forecasting model demonstrates the efficacy of a hand hygiene program and the need to limit the use of certain restricted antimicrobials in order to reduce the incidence of HAIs and HA-MRSA infections.","Lee, Yuan-Ti; Chen, Shiuan-Chih; Lee, Meng-Chih; Hung, Hung-Chang; Huang, Huey-Jen; Lin, Hui-Chih; Wu, Der-Jinn; Tsao, Shih-Ming",The Journal of antibiotics,https://doi.org/10.1038/ja.2012.20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22569161/,15

In immunosuppressed human xenograft recipients, infection is most likely to be due to the same pathogens seen in human allotransplantation. However, organisms derived from swine and transmitted with xenografts have the potential to cause novel infections in xenograft recipients. The specific organisms likely to cause infection or ""xenosis"" are unknown but are postulated to be like those causing infection in allograft recipients. On this basis, theoretical exclusion criteria have been developed to guide the development of source animal herds. Herds developed based on the exclusion of potential human pathogens have been termed ""designated pathogen-free"" (DPF). Lists of potential pathogens will require revision with changing epidemiology of infection in swine worldwide and clinical experience. Development of new microbiological assays is required both for animal screening and in clinical diagnosis should infections occur. Genetic modifications of swine have the potential to eliminate certain infectious agents such as the porcine endogenous retrovirus; infectious complications of such modifications have not been observed. Unexpected, off target effects of genetic modifications require further study. Monitoring for infection in asymptomatic recipients is important to define infectious risks which are unknown in the absence of clinical trials data. Advanced microbiological techniques may be applied to diagnose and prevent infection in xenograft recipients.","Fishman, Jay A",Xenotransplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/xen.12595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32495461/,15

We previously found that myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC)-derived arginase-1 (Arg-1) promoted Th17 cell differentiation in SLE. In this study, we performed RNA-chip to identify the microRNA regulation network between MDSCs and Th17 cells. miR-542-5p in humans, as the homologous gene of miR-322-5p in mice was significantly upregulated in the Th17+MDSC group compared to Th17 cells cultured alone and downregulated in the Th17+MDSC+Arg-1 inhibitor group compared to the Th17+MDSC group. We further evaluated the miR-322-5p and Th17/Treg balance in mice and found that the proportions of both Th17 cells and Tregs were elevated and that miR-322-5p overexpression activated the transforming growth factor-β pathway. Moreover, although miR-322-5p expression was higher in SLE mice, it decreased after treatment with an Arg-1 inhibitor. The proportion of Th17 cells and Th17/Treg ratio correlated with miR-322-5p levels. In conclusion, MDSC-derived Arg-1 and mmu-miR-322-5p not only promote Th17 cell and Treg differentiation, but also shift the Th17/Treg ratio in SLE. The Arg-1/miR-322-5p axis may serve as a novel treatment target for SLE.","Pang, Bo; Zhen, Yu; Hu, Cong; Ma, Zhanchuan; Lin, Shan; Yi, Huanfa",Clinical science,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20200799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32808653/,15

128863,Sesquiterpenoids with Various Carbocyclic Skeletons from the Flowers of Chrysanthemum indicum.,2017,"Background Resistant hypertension, usually defined as blood pressure remaining above goal despite the concurrent use of 3 or more antihypertensive agents of different classes, is common (about 10% prevalence) and known to be a risk factor for cardiovascular events. These patients also undergo more screening intensity for secondary hypertension. However, not all patients with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension have true resistant hypertension, with some of them being nonadherent to prescribed pharmacotherapy. The prevalence of nonadherence varies from about 5% to 80% in the published literature. However, the relative contributions of intentional and nonintentional nonadherence are not well described. Nonintentional nonadherence refers to occasional forgetfulness and/or carelessness and can sometimes be related to an inability to follow instructions, because of either cognitive or physical limitations. Intentional nonadherence refers to an active process in which a patient may choose to alter the prescribed medication regimen by discontinuing medications, skipping doses, or modifying doses or dosing intervals. Objective Our objective is to establish the overall prevalence of nonadherence in the apparent treatment-resistant hypertension population and evaluate the relative contributions of nonintentional and intentional nonadherence subtypes. Design We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis. Setting We will include observational studies and randomized controlled trials where adherence to antihypertensive medications is measured using a test of adherence, either direct or indirect. Patients We will include adult human participants aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of resistant hypertension. Measurements Data extracted from individual studies will include title, first author, design, country, publication year, funding body, method of assessing adherence to antihypertensive medication, prevalence of medication nonadherence, definition of resistant hypertension, sample size, sex, mean age, and coexistent comorbidities. Methods A librarian will search the databases Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Web of Science for studies meeting criteria for inclusion. Two reviewers will independently screen the titles and abstracts retrieved and assess the methodological quality of eligible full-text articles using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for clinical trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Summary estimates of prevalence will be generated using pooled analysis using the random-effects method. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses, and evaluation of publication bias will also be performed. Results The outcomes of interest are the pooled prevalence of nonadherence to antihypertensive medication in apparent treatment-resistant hypertension and the prevalence of nonadherence based on different methods of assessing nonadherence (indirect vs direct), which will allow us to estimate the relative proportion of unintentional and intentional nonadherence subtypes in the overall phenomenon of medication nonadherence. Limitations Possible limitations of this study include the finding of severe heterogeneity, the limitations of the literature search, publication bias, and the lack of granular data in the published studies for a study-level meta-analysis. Conclusions This systematic review will provide a synthesis of current evidence on the prevalence of medication nonadherence in apparent treatment-resistant hypertension and on the relative contributions of nonintentional and intentional nonadherence subtypes. These findings will provide clinicians with a better understanding of the factors underlying treatment-resistant hypertension and will serve as a strong research base to guide future research on interventions to address medication nonadherence as well as the nonintentional and intentional subtypes.

130217,Enhancing the Performance of Dye Sensitized Solar Cells Using Silver Nanoparticles Modified Photoanode.,2020-09-03,"BACKGROUND Avoidance of airway complications and rapid emergence from anaesthesia are indispensable for the use of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Evidence from adequately powered randomised studies with a low risk of bias for the optimal anaesthetic in this context is limited. OBJECTIVE We tested the hypothesis that when using remifentanil-based intra-operative analgesia, desflurane would be the most suitable anaesthetic: with noninferiority in the occurrence of upper airway complications and superiority in emergence times compared with sevoflurane or propofol. DESIGN A randomised, multicentre, partially double-blinded, three-arm, parallel-group study. SETTING Two university and two regional German hospitals, from February to October 2015. PATIENTS A total of 352 patients (age 18 to 75 years, ASA physical status I to III, BMI less than 35 kg m and fluent in German) were enrolled in this study. All surgery was elective with a duration of 0.5 to 2 h, and general anaesthesia with a LMA was feasible. INTERVENTION The patients were randomised to receive desflurane, sevoflurane or propofol anaesthesia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES This study was powered for the primary outcome 'time to state date of birth' and the secondary outcome 'intra-operative cough'. Time to emergence from anaesthesia and the incidence of upper airway complications were assessed on the day of surgery. RESULTS The primary outcome was analysed for 343 patients: desflurane (n=114), sevoflurane (n=111) and propofol (n=118). The desflurane group had the fastest emergence. The mean (± SD) times to state the date of birth following desflurane, sevoflurane and propofol were 8.1 ± 3.6, 10.1 ± 4.0 and 9.8 ± 5.1 min, respectively (P < 0.01). There was no difference in upper airway complications (cough and laryngospasm) across the groups, but these complications were less frequent than in previous studies. CONCLUSION When using a remifentanil infusion for intra-operative analgesia in association with a LMA, desflurane was associated with a significantly faster emergence and noninferiority in the incidence of intra-operative cough than either sevoflurane or Propofol.

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) and to investigate whether PRG can be applied for patients with advanced esophageal cancer. METHODS In this study, 89 patients (74 men and 15 women) with advanced esophageal cancer underwent PRG using computed tomography and fluoroscopic guidance. These patients were unsuitable candidates for endoscopic intervention because of esophageal stricture. Primary placement of a mushroom-retained gastrostomy catheter was intended. The end points were technical success and complications after PRG as well as clinical outcomes and survival of the patients. These end points also were compared between the pre-chemoradiotherapy (pre-CRT) and post-CRT groups using the Chi square test, Fisher's exact test, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS All the patients had a successful PRG. The mushroom-tip gastrostomy catheter was primarily inserted in 77 patients (86.5 %) and finally achieved for all the patients. Complications occurred for 14 patients (15.7 %) including Dindo-Clavien classification grade 3 (1 catheter dislodgement), grade 2 (2 gastric hemorrhages), and grade 1 (7 skin infections and 4 oozing hemorrhages) complications. During the follow-up period (median, 6 months), 60 patients (67.4 %) died, giving a 12-month survival rate of 37.7 %. Gastrostomy removal was more common in the pre-CRT group (P = 0.011). The pre-CRT group had higher survival rates than the post-CRT group (P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS Because PRG provided high technical success with limited complications, it can be used for patients with advanced esophageal cancer whose treatment plan involves multimodal therapy.","Sofue, Keitaro; Takeuchi, Yoshito; Tsurusaki, Masakatsu; Shibamoto, Kentaro; Sakamoto, Noriaki; Kitajima, Kazuhiro; Sone, Miyuki; Sugimura, Kazuro; Arai, Yasuaki",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-016-5276-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27188297/,15

Chemotherapy consisted of protracted infusion of 5-fluoracil (800 mg/m2/day) on days 1-5 and cisplatin or nedaplatin (80 mg/m2/day) on day 1. The median (range) follow-up was 47 (6-127) months. The 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 71.2% and 60.6%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate was significantly higher in patients with the SLC31A1 rs10981694 C allele compared with the rs10981694 A/A genotype (91.7% vs. 65.0%, P = 0.018). The 5-year disease-free survival rate was significantly higher in patients with the SLC31A1 rs10981694 C allele compared with the rs10981694 A/A genotype (79.2% vs. 55.0%, P = 0.043). In addition, univariate and multivariate analyses showed the SLC31A1 rs10981694 A > C polymorphism to be a significant prognostic factor affecting 5-year overall survival after neoadjuvant CRT. However, the overall and disease-free survival rates after surgery did not differ significantly among the ATP7B rs9535828 genotypes. In conclusion, only the SLC31A1 rs10981694 A/A genotype was an independent predictor of a poorer 5-year overall survival. Therefore, in neoadjuvant CRT for ESCC patients, the effect of platinum was affected by the SLC31A1 rs10981694 A > C polymorphism. The presence of this polymorphism should be considered when devising neoadjuvant CRT regimens or treatment strategies for ESCC.","Fujita, Kazuma; Motoyama, Satoru; Sato, Yusuke; Wakita, Akiyuki; Nagaki, Yushi; Minamiya, Yoshihiro; Miura, Masatomo",Medical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12032-020-01450-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411033/,15

PATIENTS AND METHODS After ethics committee approval and informed consent, 35 patients with body mass index >35 undergoing single-port sleeve gastrectomy (SPSG) were enrolled. All patients received balanced general anesthesia, followed by intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA; hydromorphone) postoperatively; all reported VAS >3 upon arrival to the recovery room. From the cohort of 35 patients having single-port laparoscopy (SPL), a sealed envelope method was used to randomly select ten patients to the TAP group and 25 patients to the control group. The ten patients in the TAP group received ultrasound-guided TAP blocks with 30 mL of 0.2% Ropivacaine injected bilaterally. The dermatomal distribution of the sensory block (by pinprick test) was recorded. VAS scores for the first 24 hours after surgery and opioid use were compared between the IV-PCA+TAP block and IV-PCA only groups. RESULTS Sensory block ranged from T5-L1. Mean VAS pain scores decreased from 8 ± 2 to 4 ± 3 (P=0.04) within 30 minutes of TAP block administration. Compared with patients given IV-PCA only, significantly fewer patients who received TAP block had moderate or severe pain (VAS 4-10) after block administration at 6 hours and 12 hours post-surgery. However, cumulative consumption of hydromorphone at 24 hours after SPSG surgery was similar for both groups. CONCLUSION Ultrasound-guided TAP blocks in morbidly obese patients are feasible and result in satisfactory analgesia following SPSG in the immediate postoperative period.","Wassef, Michael; Lee, David Y; Levine, Jun L; Ross, Ronald E; Guend, Hamza; Vandepitte, Catherine; Hadzic, Admir; Teixeira, Julio",Journal of pain research,https://doi.org/10.2147/jpr.s50561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24348067/,15
133113,Form follows function: lymphoid tissue microarchitecture in antimicrobial immune defence.,2008,"OBJECTIVE To clarify the benefit of energy devices such as ultrasonically activated device and bipolar vessel sealing device in liver surgeries. BACKGROUND Several studies have suggested the benefit of energy devices in liver transection, while a randomized trial has found no association between their use and surgical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients scheduled to undergo open liver resection were eligible for this multicenter non-blinded randomized study. They were randomized to receive an energy device (experimental group) or not (control group) during liver transection. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with intraoperative blood loss >1,000 mL. The primary aim was to show non-inferiority of hepatectomy with energy device to that without energy device. RESULTS A total of 212 patients were randomized and 211 (105 and 106 in the respective groups) were analyzed. Intraoperative blood loss >1,000 mL occurred in 15.0% patients with energy device and 20.2% patients without energy device. The experimental minus control group difference was -5.2% (95% confidence interval -13.8 to 3.3%; non-inferiority test, p = 0.0248). Hepatectomy with energy device resulted in a shorter median liver transection time (63 vs. 84 min; p < 0.001) and a lower rate of postoperative bile leakage (4 vs. 16%; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS The hypothesis that hepatectomy with energy device is not inferior to that without energy device in terms of blood loss has been demonstrated. The use of energy devices during liver surgery is clinically meaningful as it shortens the liver transection time and reduces the incidence of postoperative bile leakage.","Gotohda, Naoto; Yamanaka, Takeharu; Saiura, Akio; Uesaka, Katsuhiko; Hashimoto, Masaji; Konishi, Masaru; Shimada, Kazuaki",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-015-2967-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637271/,15
133266,A cost-benefit analysis of the physical mechanisms of membrane curvature.,2013,"PURPOSE To describe our technique for retroperitoneal laparoscopic radical nephrectomy (LRN) and to present the perioperative outcomes of our retroperitoneal LRN series for large (>7 cm) solid renal tumors and to compare them with those of the transperitoneal approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed for patients who had undergone LRN for a solid renal tumor greater than 7 cm in size on computed tomography (CT) scans between June 2008 and January 2016. Perioperative outcomes were compared between transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches. RESULTS There were 30 cases in the transperitoneal approach group and 34 cases in the retroperitoneal group. The mean tumor size was 9.0 cm in the transperitoneal approach group and 10.3 cm in the retroperitoneal group (P = .494). In the retroperitoneal approach group, the operation time was shorter, estimated blood loss (EBL) was lower, and time to start diet was shorter (P < .001, P = .037, and P = .002, respectively). The complication rate was comparable between the two approaches. CONCLUSIONS Retroperitoneal LRN for a large (>7 cm) solid renal tumor demonstrated a superior result in terms of operation time, estimated blood loss, and time to start diet than transperitoneal LRN. Other perioperative outcomes and complication rate were comparable between the two approaches. We believe that with sufficient experience, retroperitoneal LRN may be an effective and safe procedure for large (>7 cm) solid renal tumors.","Kim, Hee Youn; Lee, Dong Sup; Yoo, Je Mo; Lee, Joon Ho; Lee, Seung-Ju",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

133599,Genetics in Virology Research.,2015,"Influenza can cause acute lung injury. Because immune responses often play a role, antivirals may not ensure a successful outcome. To identify pathogenic mechanisms and potential adjunctive therapeutic options, we compared the extent to which avian influenza A/H5N1 virus and seasonal influenza A/H1N1 virus impair alveolar fluid clearance and protein permeability in an in vitro model of acute lung injury, defined the role of virus-induced soluble mediators in these injury effects, and demonstrated that the effects are prevented or reduced by bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells. We verified the in vivo relevance of these findings in mice experimentally infected with influenza A/H5N1. We found that, in vitro, the alveolar epithelium's protein permeability and fluid clearance were dysregulated by soluble immune mediators released upon infection with avian (A/Hong Kong/483/97, H5N1) but not seasonal (A/Hong Kong/54/98, H1N1) influenza virus. The reduced alveolar fluid transport associated with down-regulation of sodium and chloride transporters was prevented or reduced by coculture with mesenchymal stromal cells. In vivo, treatment of aged H5N1-infected mice with mesenchymal stromal cells increased their likelihood of survival. We conclude that mesenchymal stromal cells significantly reduce the impairment of alveolar fluid clearance induced by A/H5N1 infection in vitro and prevent or reduce A/H5N1-associated acute lung injury in vivo. This potential adjunctive therapy for severe influenza-induced lung disease warrants rapid clinical investigation.","Chan, Michael C W; Kuok, Denise I T; Leung, Connie Y H; Hui, Kenrie P Y; Valkenburg, Sophie A; Lau, Eric H Y; Nicholls, John M; Fang, Xiaohui; Guan, Yi; Lee, Jae W; Chan, Renee W Y; Webster, Robert G; Matthay, Michael A; Peiris, J S Malik",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1601911113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26976597/,15

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to summarize published data for resorbable implants in orbital reconstruction, including polymer composition, degradation characteristics, osteoconductivity, and complications such as enophthalmos, diplopia, and peri-implant inflammation. A literature search of the National Library of Medicine was performed via PubMed using the keyword resorbable orbital implant. A total of 27 studies were reviewed. Strength of data was assessed according to the Oxford Centre criteria. RESULTS Most commercially available implants provide adequate tensile strength for up to 6 months (with the exception of polydioxanone, which loses strength within 1 month, and poly(D,L-lactide) within 3 months). This is sufficient for the isolated orbital floor or medial wall (tensile strength, ~300 MPa) but insufficient for reconstruction of load-bearing areas (eg, the inferior orbital rim with tensile strength of ~1.2 GPa). Thicker products (>1 mm) have increased risk for delayed inflammation than thinner products. Postoperative complications including delayed inflammation (0%-9%), eyelid malposition (0%-5%), enophthalmos (5%-16%), diplopia (0%-16%), infection (0%-2%), and infraorbital nerve hypesthesia (2%-18%) are variably distributed across implants with several notable exceptions: poly(L-lactide) has an increased risk of delayed inflammation, and polydioxanone has a risk of delayed enophthalmos and hematoma. CONCLUSIONS Resorbable implants are suitable for isolated medial wall or floor fractures with intact bony buttresses and function as a barrier rather than a load-bearing support.","Ramesh, Sathyadeepak; Hubschman, Sasha; Goldberg, Robert",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000001504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29851726/,15

The application of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) has been suggested as a novel treatment. In this paper, we present systematic reviews of pre-clinical and clinical studies of MSC therapy for second- or third-degree thermal burn wounds. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, the PubMed and Embase databases were searched, and interventional studies of MSC therapy using rodent models (21 studies) or human burn patients (three studies) were included in the pre-clinical and clinical reviews, respectively, where both overall outcome and wound-healing-phase-specific methodologies and effects were assessed. The pre-clinical studies demonstrated a promising effect of the application of MSCs on several wound healing phases. The clinical studies also suggested that the MSC treatment was beneficial, particularly in the remodeling phase. However, the limited number of studies, their lack of homogeneity in study design, relatively high risk of bias, lack of reporting on mode of action (MOA), and discontinuity of evidence restrict the strength of these findings. This comprehensive review presents an overview of available methodologies to assess the MOA of MSC treatment for distinct wound healing phases. Furthermore, it includes a set of recommendations for the design of high-quality clinical studies that can determine the efficacy of MSCs as a therapy for burn wounds.","Henriksen, Josefine Lin; Sørensen, Nana Brandborg; Fink, Trine; Zachar, Vladimir; Porsborg, Simone Riis",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9122545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33256038/,15

We reviewed a prospectively collected database of all multiple-tract PCNL planned as overnight surgery performed by a single surgeon since 2018. A clinical pathway including the removal of nephrostomy tube and discharge on the morning after surgery was carried out. A definition for tube removal was outlined. Ability to adhere to the pathway and achieving the described parameters and whether any resulting complications occurred were determined. A total of 136 consecutive patients were enrolled with mean stone burden of 960.5 mm2 and 5.1 cm. Mean operative time was 71.7 ± 30.7 min. The average hemoglobin drop was 17.6 ± 12.2 g/L, and the incidence of drop > 25 g/L was 21.9%. Overall, 125 patients (91.9%) but 11 patients were discharge on postoperative day 1. One case required readmission. Among the 11 patients, 7 patients (5.1%) underwent a delayed tube removal (≥ 2 days) and 4 patients underwent complications after next-day nephrostomy tube removal, including renal colic (2 cases), hydrothorax (1 case), and fever (1 case). Postoperative fever or severe hematuria was the major reason for delayed nephrostomy tube removal. The total complication rate was 8.8% (n = 12). Multiple-tract PCNL as an overnight surgery can be safely performed by experienced surgeons in most patients. An early nephrostomy tube removal could be achieved in nearly 95% patients.","Zhao, Zhijian; Yin, Shanfeng; Zhu, Huacai; Cheng, Donglong; Liu, Yongda; Zeng, Guohua",Urolithiasis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00240-020-01208-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839877/,15

Portal vein rerouting with ligation of one branch of the portal vein bifurcation (PVL) or embolization (PVE) leads to a moderate liver volume increase over several weeks with a clinical dropout rate of 20-40%, mostly due to tumor progression during the waiting period. Accelerated liver regeneration by the Associating Liver Partition and Portal vein Ligation for Staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) was poised to overcome this limitation by reduction of the waiting time, but failed due increased perioperative complications. Simultaneous portal and hepatic vein embolization (PVE/HVE) is a novel minimal invasive way to induce rapid liver growth without the need of two surgeries. PURPOSE This article summarizes published results of PVE/HVE and analyzes what is known about its efficacy to achieve resection, safety, and the volume changes induced. CONCLUSIONS PVE/HVE holds promise to induce accelerated liver regeneration in a similar safety profile to PVE. The demonstrated accelerated hypertrophy may increase resectability. Randomized trials will have to compare PVE/HVE and PVE to determine if PVE/HVE is superior to PVE.","Heil, Jan; Schadde, Erik",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-020-01960-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839889/,15

Several techniques exist to transect the hepatic parenchyma laparoscopically and include transection with stapler and/or energy devices, such as ultrasonic shears, radiofrequency ablation and bipolar devices. We believe that coagulative techniques allow for superior anatomic resections and ultimately permit for the performance of more complex hepatic resections. In the stapling technique, Glisson's capsule is usually incised with an energy device until the parenchyma is thinned out and multiple firings of the staplers are then used to transect the remaining parenchyma and larger bridging segmental vessels and ducts. Besides the economic constraints of using multiple stapler firings, the remaining staples have the disadvantage of hindering and even preventing additional hemostasis of the raw liver surface with monopolar and bipolar electrocautery. The laparoscopic stapler device is, however, useful for transection of the main portal branches and hepatic veins during minimally invasive major hepatic resections. Techniques to safely perform major hepatic resection with the above techniques will be described with an emphasis on when and how laparoscopic vascular staplers should be used.","Gumbs, Andrew A; Gayet, Brice; Gagner, Michel",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,https://doi.org/10.1080/13651820802166773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18773113/,15

There is a dearth of research on epidemiology and clinical outcomes in US patients with COVID-19. Objectives To characterize patients with COVID-19 treated in US hospitals and to examine risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study was conducted using Premier Healthcare Database, a large geographically diverse all-payer hospital administrative database including 592 acute care hospitals in the United States. Inpatient and hospital-based outpatient visits with a principal or secondary discharge diagnosis of COVID-19 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code, U07.1) between April 1 and May 31, 2020, were included. Exposures Characteristics of patients were reported by inpatient/outpatient and survival status. Risk factors associated with death examined included patient characteristics, acute complications, comorbidities, and medications. Main Outcomes and Measures In-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, total hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, acute complications, and treatment patterns. Results Overall, 64 781 patients with COVID-19 (29 479 [45.5%] outpatients; 35 302 [54.5%] inpatients) were analyzed. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 46 (33-59) years for outpatients and 65 (52-77) years for inpatients; 31 968 (49.3%) were men, 25 841 (39.9%) were White US residents, and 14 340 (22.1%) were Black US residents. In-hospital mortality was 20.3% among inpatients (7164 patients). A total of 5625 inpatients (15.9%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, and 6849 (19.4%) were admitted to the ICU. Median (IQR) inpatient LOS was 6 (3-10) days. Median (IQR) ICU LOS was 5 (2-10) days. Common acute complications among inpatients included acute respiratory failure (19 706 [55.8%]), acute kidney failure (11 971 [33.9%]), and sepsis (11 910 [33.7%]). Older age was the risk factor most strongly associated with death (eg, age ≥80 years vs 18-34 years: odds ratio [OR], 16.20; 95% CI, 11.58-22.67; P < .001). Receipt of statins (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.56-0.65; P < .001), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.46-0.60; P < .001), and calcium channel blockers (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68-0.79; P < .001) was associated with decreased odds of death. Compared with patients with no hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin, patients with both azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine had increased odds of death (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11-1.31; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of patients with COVID-19 infection in US acute care hospitals, COVID-19 was associated with high ICU admission and in-hospital mortality rates.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and acceptability of a COVID-19 Health Review for Correctional Facilities. METHODS The COVID-19 Health Review survey for the Department of Corrections was developed in Qualtrics to assess the following: (1) COVID-19 testing; (2) providing PPE; (3) vaccination procedures; (4) quarantine procedures; (5) COVID-19 mortality rates for inmates; (6) COVID-19 mortality rates for correctional officers and prison staff; (7) COVID-19 infection rates for inmates; (8) COVID-19 infection rates for correctional officers and prison staff; and (9) uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. The estimated time to review the Alabama State Department of Corrections COVID-19 responses on their website and complete the survey items was 45 minutes to one hour. RESULTS Of the twenty-one participants who completed the COVID-19 Health Review for Correctional Facilities survey, 48% identified as male, 43% identified as female, and 10% percent identified as transgender. For race, 30% self-identified as Black or African American, 24% Asian, 24% White, 5% Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian, and 19% Other. In addition, five respondents self-identified as returning citizens. For COVID-19 review questions, the majority concluded that information on personal protective equipment was 'poor' and 'very poor,' information on COVID-19 testing was 'fair' and above, information on COVID-19 death rates/infection rates between inmates and staff was 'good' and 'very good,' information on vaccinations was 'good' and 'very good.' There was a significant difference observed (p=0.0256) between non-returning citizens and returning citizens regarding COVID-19 infection rates.

HLPD patients were mostly converted to open for planned reconstruction or vascular resection. With increasing experience, more TLPDs were performed, including laparoscopic anastomoses. Median operating time was 462 min (504 min for TLPD). Median length of hospital stay was 10 days. Histology showed 21 invasive malignancies, two neuroendocrine tumours, two intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and two benign lesions. Median nodal harvest was 22. Margin negative resection was achieved in 84% of patients. Twenty-two percent of patients developed a Grade 3/4 complication, including 19% clinically significant pancreatic fistula. There was one perioperative mortality (4%) due to pancreatic fistula, post-operative haemorrhage and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS LPD is a technically challenging operation with a steep learning curve. The early oncological outcomes appear satisfactory. It remains to be determined whether the minimally invasive approach to pancreaticoduodenectomy offers benefits to patients.","Patel, Bhavik; Leung, Universe; Lee, Jerry; Bryant, Richard; O'Rourke, Nicholas; Cavallucci, David",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.14020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29024280/,15

Since it was identified in 2012, approximately 2500 MERS cases with high mortality have been confirmed in 27 countries. Although most cases have occurred in the Middle East, an outbreak in South Korea in 2015 showed that MERS could be a global threat via human-to-human transmission. There is no licensed vaccine against MERS. Thus, early detection is the best way to limit the spread of this fatal disease.

137721,Multispectral intravital microscopy for simultaneous bright-field and fluorescence imaging of the microvasculature.,2021-07-24,"BACKGROUND Nurses frequently face ethically demanding situations in their work, and these may lead to stress of conscience. Working life is currently accelerating and job demands are intensifying. These intensified job demands include (1) work intensification, (2) intensified job-related planning demands, (3) intensified career-related planning demands, and (4) intensified learning demands. At the same time, many healthcare organizations are implementing major organizational changes that have an influence on personnel. AIM The aim of the study was to investigate the association between intensified job demands and stress of conscience, and whether their association is moderated by organizational change experiences among nurses. Experiences of organizational change may expose employees to stress of conscience or serve as a buffer because employees appraise, involve, and cope with changes differently. RESEARCH DESIGN Questionnaires measuring stress of conscience, intensified job demands, and organizational change experiences were completed by nurses (n = 511) in a healthcare district undergoing a major organizational change. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Throughout, the study procedures were implemented according to the guidelines of the Finnish National Board on Research Integrity and the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. According to the Finnish regulations, because participation was voluntary, informed consent was requested, and participants were advised of their right to withdraw from the study at will. No permission from an ethics committee was necessary. FINDINGS Work intensification and personal worry considering organizational change were associated with more severe stress of conscience among nurses. Nurses' experiences of managements' competent handling of organizational change buffered the association between work intensification and stress of conscience. CONCLUSIONS During organizational changes, management may alleviate nurses' stress of conscience by proper communication and support procedures.","Heikkilä, Mikko; Huhtala, Mari; Mauno, Saija; Feldt, Taru",Nursing ethics,https://doi.org/10.1177/09697330211006831; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34374305/,15

Here we present a first look at RNA sequence conservation and structural propensities in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Using sequence alignments spanning a range of betacoronaviruses, we rank genomic regions by RNA sequence conservation, identifying 79 regions of length at least 15 nucleotides as exactly conserved over SARS-related complete genome sequences available near the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. We then confirm the conservation of the majority of these genome regions across 739 SARS-CoV-2 sequences subsequently reported from the COVID-19 outbreak, and we present a curated list of 30 'SARS-related-conserved' regions. We find that known RNA structured elements curated as Rfam families and in prior literature are enriched in these conserved genome regions, and we predict additional conserved, stable secondary structures across the viral genome. We provide 106 'SARS-CoV-2-conserved-structured' regions as potential targets for antivirals that bind to structured RNA. We further provide detailed secondary structure models for the extended 5' UTR, frame-shifting element, and 3' UTR. Last, we predict regions of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome that have low propensity for RNA secondary structure and are conserved within SARS-CoV-2 strains. These 59 'SARS-CoV-2-conserved-unstructured' genomic regions may be most easily targeted in primer-based diagnostic and oligonucleotide-based therapeutic strategies.","Rangan, Ramya; Zheludev, Ivan N; Das, Rhiju",RNA,https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.076141.120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32398273/,15

A review.,2021-03-03,"Asunaprevir (ASV; BMS-650032) is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 when combined with alfa interferon and/or the NS5A replication complex inhibitor daclatasvir. ASV competitively binds to the NS3/4A protease complex, with K(i) values of 0.4 and 0.24 nM against recombinant enzymes representing genotypes 1a (H77) and 1b (J4L6S), respectively. Selectivity was demonstrated by the absence of any significant activity against the closely related GB virus-B NS3 protease and a panel of human serine or cysteine proteases. In cell culture, ASV inhibited replication of HCV replicons representing genotypes 1 and 4, with 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) ranging from 1 to 4 nM, and had weaker activity against genotypes 2 and 3 (EC(50), 67 to 1,162 nM). Selectivity was again demonstrated by the absence of activity (EC(50), >12 μM) against a panel of other RNA viruses. ASV exhibited additive or synergistic activity in combination studies with alfa interferon, ribavirin, and/or inhibitors specifically targeting NS5A or NS5B. Plasma and tissue exposures in vivo in several animal species indicated that ASV displayed a hepatotropic disposition (liver-to-plasma ratios ranging from 40- to 359-fold across species). Twenty-four hours postdose, liver exposures across all species tested were ≥110-fold above the inhibitor EC(50)s observed with HCV genotype-1 replicons. Based on these virologic and exposure properties, ASV holds promise for future utility in a combination with other anti-HCV agents in the treatment of HCV-infected patients.","McPhee, Fiona; Sheaffer, Amy K; Friborg, Jacques; Hernandez, Dennis; Falk, Paul; Zhai, Guangzhi; Levine, Steven; Chaniewski, Susan; Yu, Fei; Barry, Diana; Chen, Chaoqun; Lee, Min S; Mosure, Kathy; Sun, Li-Qiang; Sinz, Michael; Meanwell, Nicholas A; Colonno, Richard J; Knipe, Jay; Scola, Paul",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01186-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22869577/,15

Parents are one of the main sources of emotional support for their child, but their ability to provide proper care during their child's illness and treatment depends entirely on the way they manage to cope with diagnosis and its outcomes. Parents' coping pattern seems to be affected by their perception of themselves or their surroundings. Aim To investigate parents' coping strategies with childhood cancer and its relation with self-construal. Methods A total of 127 eligible parents participated in this descriptive correlational study. Results Medical, social support, and family strategies were respectively helpful for parents. The interdependent self-construal score was higher than the independent self-construal score. A significant relationship was found between interdependent self-construal and social support (P = .01).

138945,The compromise of virtual screening and its impact on drug discovery.,2019,"The automatic extraction of the vertebra's shape from dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could improve understanding of clinical conditions and their diagnosis. It is hypothesized that the shape of the sacral curve is related to the development of some gynecological conditions such as pelvic organ prolapse (POP). POP is a critical health condition for women and consists of pelvic organs dropping from their normal position. Dynamic MRI is used for assessing POP and to complement clinical examination. Studies have shown some evidence on the association between the shape of the sacral curve and the development of POP. However, the sacral curve is currently extracted manually limiting studies to small datasets and inconclusive evidence. A method composed of an adaptive shortest path algorithm that enhances edge detection and linking, and an improved curve fitting procedure is proposed to automate the identification and segmentation of the sacral curve on MRI. The proposed method uses predetermined pixels surrounding the sacral curve that are found through edge detection to decrease computation time compared to other model-based segmentation algorithms. Moreover, the proposed method is fully automatic and does not require user input or training. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately identify sacral curves for nearly 91% of dynamic MRI cases tested in this study. The proposed model is robust and can be used to effectively identify bone structures on MRI.","Onal, Sinan; Chen, Xin; Lai-Yuen, Susana; Hart, Stuart",Journal of medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1117/1.jmi.4.1.014504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28386577/,15

METHODS A total of 6635 patients were screened from the German Stroke Registry. Patients who underwent EVT for occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (M1 segment), with final TICI score of 2b/3 were included. Multivariable logistic regression was performed with functional independence (modified Rankin Scale, mRS at day 90 of 0-2) as the dependent variable. RESULTS Of 1497 patients, 586 (39.1%) met inclusion criteria with a final TICI score of 2b and 911 (60.9%) with a TICI score of 3. Patients who achieved first-pass TICI3 showed highest odds of functional independence (Odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.18-2.47). Patients who achieved TICI2b with the second pass (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31-0.89) or with three or more passes (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27-0.70) had significantly worse clinical outcomes compared to first-pass TICI2b. TICI3 at the second pass was by trend better than first-pass TICI2b (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.98-2.45), but TICI3 after 3 or more passes (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.57-1.50) was not significantly different from first-pass TICI2b. CONCLUSION First-pass TICI2b was superior to TICI2b after ≥ 2 retrievals and comparable to TICI3 at ≥ 3 retrievals. The potential benefit in outcome after achieving TICI3 following further retrieval attempts after first-pass TICI2b need to be weighed against the risks.","Flottmann, F; van Horn, N; Maros, M E; McDonough, R; Deb-Chatterji, M; Alegiani, A; Thomalla, G; Hanning, U; Fiehler, J; Brekenfeld, C",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-021-01048-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191040/,15

Because patients in these settings may be opioid-naïve, the study was conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple dose administration of fentanyl sublingual spray in an opioid-naïve population. METHODS Fentanyl sublingual spray (100 mcg, 200 mcg, and 400 mcg) and fentanyl citrate intravenous (IV; 50 mcg) were administered every 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 h for up to three doses per cohort in opioid-naïve subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02641340). Eight subjects in each cohort were randomly assigned (six subjects received fentanyl sublingual spray; two subjects received fentanyl citrate IV). Pharmacokinetic and safety-related pharmacodynamic assessments were performed through 24 h post-first dose. Safety assessments were collected through Day 7. RESULTS Ninety-six opioid-naïve subjects, aged 20-55 years, with a body mass index of 18.7-31.5 kg/m2, participated in the study. Multiple doses of fentanyl sublingual spray (100, 200, and 400 mcg) were generally well tolerated. Hypoxia, observed in the 200-mcg and 400-mcg dose groups, increased with increasing doses and higher dosing frequency, but was readily managed by nasal cannula oxygenation. Overall, nausea increased with increasing doses, and ∼52.6% (10 out of 19) cases of nausea that occurred at the highest dose of 400 mcg were treated with concomitant medication. Overall, the reported adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of fentanyl. CONCLUSION Fentanyl sublingual spray (100 mcg, 200 mg, and 400 mcg) administered every 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h was generally well tolerated in an opioid-naïve population. The results suggest that doses of 200 mcg or lower may be safe for use in an opioid-naïve population.","Rauck, Richard L; Oh, D Alexander; Singla, Neil; Koch, Christian; Parikh, Neha; Nalamachu, Srinivas; Wilson, Daniel; Yu, Jin; Vetticaden, Santosh",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2017.1371681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28942715/,15

Personal protective equipment (PPE) use is recommended in all surgeries. The authors have experienced varying degrees of field of view (FOV) loss under the surgical microscope with different PPE. Herein, they aimed to investigate the effects of different PPE on FOV while using the surgical microscope. METHODS Fifteen neurosurgeons and neurosurgery residents participated in this study. Three kinds of PPE (safety spectacles, blast goggles, and face shields) were tested while using a surgical microscope. FOV was measured using a 12 × 12-cm checkered sheet of paper on which every square had an area of 25 mm2 under the microscope. The surgical microscope was positioned perpendicular to the test paper, and the zoom was fixed. Each participant marked on the test sheet the peripheral borders of their FOV while using different PPE and without wearing any PPE. A one-way repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to determine if there was a significant difference in FOV values with the different PPE. RESULTS FOV was significantly different between each PPE (F[3, 42] = 6339.845, p < 0.0005). Post hoc analysis revealed a significant decrease in the FOV from the naked eye (9305.33 ± 406.1 mm2) to blast goggles (2501.91 ± 176.5 mm2) and face shields (92.33 ± 6.4 mm2). There were no significant FOV changes with the safety spectacles (9267.45 ± 410.5 mm2). CONCLUSIONS While operating under a surgical microscope safety spectacles provide favorable FOVs. Face shields increase the eye piece-pupil distance, which causes a severe reduction in FOV.","Celtikci, Emrah; Karaaslan, Burak; Börcek, Alp Özgün; Emmez, Omer Hakan",Neurosurgical focus,https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.9.focus20370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260123/,15

The rapid sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus facilitated identification of the receptor for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the high affinity binding site that allows virus endocytosis. Parallel evidence that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease evolution shows greater lethality in patients with antecedent cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or even obesity questioned the potential unfavorable contribution of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers as facilitators of adverse outcomes due to the ability of these therapies to augment the transcription of Ace2 with consequent increase in protein formation and enzymatic activity. We review, here, the specific studies that support a role of these agents in altering the expression and activity of ACE2 and underscore that the robustness of the experimental data is associated with weak clinical long-term studies of the existence of a similar regulation of tissue or plasma ACE2 in human subjects.","Ferrario, Carlos M; Ahmad, Sarfaraz; Groban, Leanne",Clinical science,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20200901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33063823/,15

While numerous studies have reported increased amygdala activity following traumatic stress exposure and in PTSD, the findings regarding amygdala volume have been mixed. One reason for these mixed findings may be that the amygdala has been considered as a homogenous entity, while it in fact consists of several nuclei with unique cellular and connectivity profiles. Here, we investigated amygdala nuclei volumes of the basolateral and the centrocorticomedial complex in relation to PTSD symptom severity in 47 young survivors from the 2011 Norwegian terror attack 24-36 months post-trauma. PTSD symptoms were assessed 4-5, 14-15 and 24-36 months following the trauma. We found that increased PTSD symptom severity 24-36 months post-trauma was associated with volumetric reductions of all basolateral as well as the central and the medial nuclei. However, only the lateral nucleus was associated with longitudinal symptom development, and mediated the association between 4-5 months and 24-36 months post-trauma symptoms. The results suggest that the amygdala nuclei may be differentially associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of PTSD symptom severity. As such, investigations of amygdala total volume may not provide an adequate index of the association between amygdala and stress-related mental illness.","Ousdal, Olga Therese; Milde, Anne Marita; Hafstad, Gertrud Sofie; Hodneland, Erlend; Dyb, Grete; Craven, Alexander R; Melinder, Annika; Endestad, Tor; Hugdahl, Kenneth",Translational psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-00974-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807799/,15

Yet, Palestine's response to the pandemic is outperforming many countries in the region. The early preventative lockdown measures in the West Bank found effective and not overwhelming the already over-stretched health system. While in the Gaza Strip, the response was slow. Prisoners, labours, besieged people, socioeconomic-disadvantaged classes, and refugees were put at additional high risk. Nonetheless, measures taken were unconsolidated in both regions largely due to the political factors. A little collaboration and inter-agency task forces in preparedness and response was observed, and the mechanisms and governance remain ambiguous.

Influenza has been the primary driver of rapid laboratory testing due to its morbidity and mortality across all ages, the availability of antiviral therapy, which must be given early to have an effect, and the constant threat of new pandemic strains. Over the past 30 years, there has been an evolution in viral diagnostic testing, from viral culture to rapid antigen detection, and more recently, to highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), as well as a trend to testing at the point of care (POC). Simple rapid antigen immunoassays have long been the mainstay for POC testing for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) but have been faulted for low sensitivity. In 2015, the first POC NAAT for the detection of influenza was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ushering in a new era. In 2017, the FDA reclassified rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) from class I to class II devices with new minimum performance standards and a requirement for annual reactivity testing. Consequently, many previously available RIDTs can no longer be purchased in the United States.

Bivariate analyses indicated telehealth users were more likely to score higher feelings of safety and positive work morale, as well as perceive employer expectations to be reasonable. Restricted access to technology, limitations of remote practice, funding issues and slow pace of change were identified as barriers for some respondents for use of telehealth. Facilitators included availability of supportive policy, guidelines and strategies, in addition to education and training. CONCLUSION This study advances the understanding of the current scope of occupational therapy telehealth practice in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although results suggest long-term potential for telehealth use as an adjunct to traditional service provision, important considerations were identified regarding factors influencing integration of such strategies.","Hoel, Viktoria; von Zweck, Claudia; Ledgerd, Ritchard",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-205268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33337401/,15

Studies show decreased AL with side-to-side stapled anastomosis (SSA), but none identify risk factors within SSAs. We hypothesized that stapler characteristics and closure technique of the common enterotomy affect AL rates. METHODS Retrospective review of bowel SSAs was performed. Data included stapler brand, staple line oversewing, and closure method (handsewn, HC; linear stapler [Barcelona technique], BT; transverse stapler, TX). Primary endpoint was AL. Statistical analysis included Fisher's test and logistic regression. RESULTS 463 patients were identified, 58.5% BT, 21.2% HC, and 20.3% TX. Covidien staplers comprised 74.9%, Ethicon 18.1%. There were no differences between stapler types (Covidien 5.8%, Ethicon 6.0%). However, AL rates varied by common side closure (BT 3.7% vs. TX 10.6%, p = 0.017), remaining significant on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION Closure method of the common side impacts AL rates. Barcelona technique has fewer leaks than transverse stapled closure. Further prospective evaluation is recommended.","Fleetwood, V A; Gross, K N; Alex, G C; Cortina, C S; Smolevitz, J B; Sarvepalli, S; Bakhsh, S R; Poirier, J; Myers, J A; Singer, M A; Orkin, B A",American journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2016.10.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28148456/,15

METHODOLOGY The study involved 60 prellingually deaf patients aged 10 to 23 years with oral speech skills. To assess the quality of the CI processor tuning, in addition to traditional methods, a special battery of psychoacoustic tests was used. The first block of tests assessed the perception of the basic characteristics of sound signals (duration, temporal structure, spectrum, timbre) and was used to assess the initial setting. The second block of tests, intended for patients with experience using CI, included tasks to distinguish acoustically similar and dynamically changing signals, etc. RESULTS At the end of the initial CI setup session, patients with short signal perception problems were identified. Adjusting the frequency of electrical stimulation in patients has increased their ability to distinguish between sounds. During the second tuning session of the CI processor, 6 months later, a group of patients with difficulties in perceiving acoustic information in the low-frequency range was identified - distinguishing melodic intervals, changing the pitch of sounds, highlighting the voice of the target speaker. The «problem» patients underwent additional correction of the CI processor setting and the corresponding auditory training, which improved the test performance and subjective perception of sounds. CONCLUSION The use of psychoacoustic tests expands the possibilities of fine tuning the CI processor, taking into account the individual characteristics of the patient's auditory perception at different stages of CI use, especially in «problem» patients.","Koroleva, I V; Ogorodnikova, E A; Levin, S V; Pak, S P; Kusovkov, V E; Yanov, Y K",Vestnik otorinolaringologii,https://doi.org/10.17116/otorino20218601130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720648/,15

Although many delirium screening tools exist, their utility, and validation within palliative care settings has not undergone systematic review. AIM To systematically review studies that validate delirium screening tools conducted in palliative care settings. DESIGN Systematic review with narrative synthesis (PROSPERO ID: CRD42019125481). A risk of bias assessment via Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 was performed. DATA SOURCES Five electronic databases were systematically searched (January 1, 1982-May 3, 2020). Quantitative studies validating a screening tool in adult palliative care patient populations were included. Studies involving alcohol withdrawal, critical or perioperative care were excluded. RESULTS Dual-reviewer screening of 3749 unique titles and abstracts identified 95 studies for full-text review and of these, 17 studies of 14 screening tools were included (n = 3496 patients). Data analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity in patient demographics and variability in screening and diagnostic practices that limited generalizability between study populations and care settings. A risk of bias assessment revealed methodological and reporting deficits, with only 3/17 studies at low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS The processes of selecting a delirium screening tool and determining optimal screening practices in palliative care are complex. One tool is unlikely to fit the needs of the entire palliative care population across all palliative care settings. Further research should be directed at evaluating and/or adapting screening tools and practices to fit the needs of specific palliative care settings and populations.","Watt, Christine L; Scott, Mary; Webber, Colleen; Sikora, Lindsey; Bush, Shirley H; Kabir, Monisha; Boland, Jason W; Woodhouse, Rebecca; Sands, Megan B; Lawlor, Peter G",Palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216321994730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588640/,15

The past decade has observed an explosion of interest in examining the existence of microbiota in the human body and understanding its role in various diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, neurologic diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Many studies have demonstrated differential community composition between normal tissue and cancerous tissue, paving the way for investigations focused on deciphering the cause-and-effect relationships between specific microbes and initiation and progression of various cancers. Also, evolving are the strategies to alter tumor-associated dysbiosis and move it towards eubiosis with holistic approaches to change the entire neighborhood or to neutralize pathogenic strains. In this review, we discuss important pathogenic bacteria and the underlying mechanisms by which they impact cancer progression. We summarize key microbiota alterations observed in multiple tumor niches, their association with clinical stages, and their potential use in cancer diagnosis and management.

Topological protection enables efficient and robust signal transport; mechanical topological insulators (TIs), in particular, are easy to fabricate and exhibit interfacial wave transport with minimal dissipation, even in the presence of sharp edges, defects, or disorder. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of a phononic crystal Floquet TI (FTI). Hexagonal arrays of circular piezoelectric disks bonded to a PLA substrate, shunted through negative electrical capacitance, and manipulated by external integrated circuits, provide the required spatiotemporal modulation scheme to break time-reversal symmetry and impart a synthetic angular momentum bias that can induce strong topological protection on the lattice edges. Our proposed reconfigurable FTI may find applications for robust acoustic emitters and mechanical logic circuits, with distinct advantages over electronic equivalents in harsh operating conditions.","Darabi, Amir; Ni, Xiang; Leamy, Michael; Alù, Andrea",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba8656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832631/,15

We aimed to define the risk of acute stroke in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. METHODS We performed an observational multicenter cohort study in four participating hospitals in Saxony, Germany to characterize consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who experienced acute stroke during hospitalization. Furthermore, we conducted a systematic review using PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and bibliographies of identified papers following PRISMA guidelines including data from observational studies of acute stroke in COVID-19 patients. Data was extracted by two independent reviewers and pooled with multicenter data to calculate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for acute stroke related to COVID-19 severity using random effects model. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q and I2 -statistics. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020187194. RESULTS Of 165 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (49.1% males, median age 67 [57-79], 72.1% severe or critical) included in the multicenter study, overall stroke rate was 4.2% (95%CI: 1.9-8.7). Systematic literature search identified two observational studies involving 576 patients that were eligible for meta-analysis. Among 741 pooled COVID-19 patients overall stroke rate was 2.9% (95%CI: 1.9-4.5). Risk of acute stroke was increased for patients with severe compared to non-severe COVID-19 (RR 4.18, 95%CI 1.7-10.25; p=0.002) with no evidence of heterogeneity (I2 =0%, p=0.82).

METHODS Representative videos of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) were voluntarily submitted by 20 surgeons who participated in a statewide quality improvement collaborative. The amount of time required to complete the salient steps of the operation was measured and variations in the tasks performed during each step were captured. RESULTS Twenty-two videos of LSG were submitted and 11 videos included concurrent hiatal hernia repair. Data obtained from video analysis identified variation in time to complete each step of the procedure: prestapling dissection of stomach (5-25 minutes), gastric stapling (8-20 minutes), and management of the staple line (1-25 minutes). Time required to perform a hiatal hernia repair also varied (1-26 minutes), as did the type of repair: 55% were performed with a posterior cruropexy, 27% were performed with an anterior cruropexy, and 18% were performed with both. Ten different permutations of staple heights and buttressing material were used during division of the stomach with a gastric stapler. Management of the staple line included use of buttressing (64%), fibrin sealant (36%), oversewing (9%), surgical clips (18%), imbrication of the staple line (36%), and omentoplasty (55%). CONCLUSIONS LSG technique is not uniform. Video analysis identified variation in (1) time to complete each step of the procedure, (2) hiatal hernia repair technique, (3) stapling technique, and (4) post-transection staple line management. Future efforts linking video analysis with clinical outcomes can provide objective evidence to support best practices.","Varban, Oliver A; Niemann, Adam; Stricklen, Amanda; Ross, Rachel; Ghaferi, Amir A; Finks, Jonathan F; Dimick, Justin B",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

The effectiveness of the SMUS is comparable to that of the historical gold standards--autologous fascial slings and the Burch colposuspension. Much controversy, however, has evolved regarding the safety of this type of sling. Overall, the quality of the studies with respect to assessing risks of SMUS-associated complications is currently poor. The most common risks in patients with SMUS include urethral obstruction requiring surgery (2.3% of patients with SMUS), vaginal, bladder and/or urethral erosion requiring surgery (1.8%) and refractory chronic pain (4.1%); these data likely represent the minimum risks. In addition, the failure rate of SMUS implantation surgery is probably at least 5% in patients with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Furthermore, at least one-third of patients undergoing sling excision surgery develop recurrent SUI. Considering the additional risks of refractory overactive bladder, fistulas and bowel perforations, among others, the overall risk of a negative outcome after SMUS implantation surgery is ≥15%.","Blaivas, Jerry G; Purohit, Rajveer S; Benedon, Matthew S; Mekel, Gabriel; Stern, Michael; Billah, Mubashir; Olugbade, Kola; Bendavid, Robert; Iakovlev, Vladimir",Nature reviews.

A regional investigation recommended the use of a securing safety strap. The authors evaluate the value of the strap through the experiences of the radiation therapists' who use it. A secondary aim is to explore the potential for using a securing safety strap with UK therapeutic radiographers. METHODS A two-stage design was guided by an evidence-based practice framework. Stage one used a questionnaire to capture treating radiation therapists' experiences and opinions of the strap at a single cancer centre. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively and free-text data via a content analysis. Stage two used semistructured interviews with thematic analysis to explore views of three UK therapeutic radiographers. RESULTS Twenty-five of approximately 130 eligible staff responded to the Canadian questionnaire. Of the respondents, 24% (n = 6) 'strongly disagreed', 28% (n = 7) 'agreed' and 48% (n = 12) 'neither agreed nor disagreed' that they would recommend the strap to other departments. Most of the respondents think strap use should be at the staffs' discretion, with patients with dementia/cognitive impairment ranked as the group benefiting most. Ninety-two percent (n = 23) of respondents confirmed that patients sometimes refuse the strap. Themes arising from stage two interviews are as follows: patient benefit (use for select patients only); patient safety versus control (restraint); and practical implementation issues. CONCLUSION The policy of universal use of the strap should be reviewed. Those who use it are equivocal about its value and feel it should be reserved for select patients at the treating professional's discretion. Full evaluation of the effectiveness and acceptability of the device for different patients may promote both staff enthusiasm towards the device and evidence-based practice. Adequate resources are required to evaluate implementation of such safety initiatives.","Judge, Annabelle; Feuz, Carina; Evans, David; Courtier, Nicholas",Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmir.2020.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680827/,15

While greatly emphasizing protection, most guiding documents have neglected to support and protect the psychosocial needs of frontline health care workers and patients and their families during provision of palliative and end-of-life care. Consequently, the stage has been set for increased anxiety, moral distress, and moral injury and extreme moral hazard. A family-centered approach to care has been unilaterally relinquished to a secondary and nonessential role during the current crisis. This phenomenon violates a foundational public health principle, namely, to apply the least restrictive means to achieve good for the many. Instead, there has been widespread adoption of utilitarian and paternalistic approaches. In many cases the foundational principles of palliative care have also been neglected. No circumstance, even a global public health emergency, should ever cause health care providers to deny their ethical obligations and human commitment to compassion. The lack of responsive protocols for family visitation, particularly at the end of life, is an important gap in the current recommendations for pandemic triage and contingency planning. A stepwise approach to hospital visitation using a tiered, standardized process for responding to emerging clinical circumstances and individual patients' needs should be considered, following the principle of proportionality. A contingency plan, based on epidemiological data, is the best strategy to refocus health care ethics in practice now and for the future.","Jones-Bonofiglio, Kristen; Nortjé, Nico; Webster, Laura; Garros, Daniel","American journal of critical care : an official publication, American Association of Critical-Care Nurses",https://doi.org/10.4037/ajcc2021611; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870412/,15

MATERIALS AND METHODS Only patients aged between 3 and 16 years, who had started treatment before the lockdown and had spent this periodwith both parents were included in the study. The interviews were carried out using an anonymous questionnaire that assessed school and play activities, the type of diet, the time dedicated to home oral hygiene and the activities carried out with parents. Parents' work situation during lockdown was included to correlate it with time spent at home. The Frankl Behavior Rating Scale was used to determine the degree of cooperation during dental sessions pre- and post-lockdown. Chi-square test and Fisher's Exact tests were used to identify statistical associations of improvement with each categorical variable. Student's t-test was used to highlight the differences in mean values of continuous variables between subjects considered more cooperative and unimproved subjects. Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model. Assumption of linearity of independent variables and log-odds were assessed by Box-Tidwell transformation. Final selection was carried out using the Akaike criterion and all statistical analyses were carried out using the STATA statistical software package. RESULTS The sample consisted of 212 patients (103F; 109M). The age ranged between 3 and 16 years with an average age of 9.03 years; 82.08% (95% CI 76.24-86.99) of the subjects showed an improvement in collaboration compared to pre-lockdown. Logistic analysis reveals a statistically significant increase of the odds of improvement in patients with a lower pre-lockdown collaboration (OR: 6.05, p = 0.001), in children with a parental presence at home (jobless, OR : 30.55, p <0.001; in ""smart working"", OR: 23.06, p <0.001) when compared to children whose parents work away from home. From a further exploratory analysis, time dedicated to home oral hygiene was increased if associated with an increased presence of the parents at home (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION Changes in family routines and increased parental presence at home, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, are associated with improved collaboration of children during dental sessions. A statistical association between the increase in time spent on oral hygiene and the increased presence of parents at home was found.","Brescia, A V; Bensi, C; Di Gennaro, G; Monda, M; Docimo, R",European journal of paediatric dentistry,https://doi.org/10.23804/ejpd.2021.22.02.10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34227823/,15

A comparison between the two groups was made. RESULTS The average operation time of group A was 36.00 ± 5.24 minutes, which was significantly shorter than that of group B, which was 43.89 ± 4.57 minutes (p = 0.002). The blood loss of group A was 5.08 ± 1.83 ml, which was significantly less than that of group B (9.67 ± 2.29 ml; p < 0.001). There were no differences in the degree of hearing improvement, the rate of hearing improvement, the dry ear time (when the external auditory canal and the operating cavity were dry) after operation and the success rate of tympanic membrane repair when compared between the two groups.

Increased concentrations of PS+, CD42a+, CD142+, CD45+, CD14+, and CD62P+ EVs were found in plasma from patients with RA compared to healthy controls, and the concentrations of PS+, CD42a+, CD14+, and CD62P+ EVs were positively correlated with the inflammatory parameters in RA patients. Positive correlations were also found between the levels of PS+ and CD42a+ EVs and OCP as well as between the levels of PS+, CD42a+, and CD62P+EVs and OHP. The levels of PS+, CD42a+, CD14+, CD62P+, and CD62E+ EVs were negatively correlated with OFP. Elevated levels of circulating EVs of different cell origins were found in patients with established RA, in relation to the inflammatory burden and coagulation activation in the disease.","Stojanovic, Aleksandra; Veselinovic, Mirjana; Zong, Yanan; Jakovljevic, Vladimir; Pruner, Iva; Antovic, Aleksandra",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.718845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394126/,15

Although mucosal routes of immunization, such as intranasal and oral, are being intensely explored and appear promising for eliciting protective mucosal immunity in mammals, their application in clinical practice has been limited due to technical and safety related challenges. Most of the currently approved human vaccines are administered via systemic (such as intramuscular and subcutaneous) routes. Whereas these routes are acknowledged as being capable to elicit antigen-specific systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, they are generally perceived as incapable of generating IgA responses or protective mucosal immunity. Nevertheless, currently licensed systemic vaccines do provide effective protection against mucosal pathogens such as influenza viruses and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, whether systemic immunization induces protective mucosal immunity remains a controversial topic. Here we reviewed the current literature and discussed the potential of systemic routes of immunization for the induction of mucosal immunity.","Su, Fei; Patel, Girishchandra B; Hu, Songhua; Chen, Wangxue",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2015.1114195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26752023/,15

Yet research done in pressured circumstances can lead to ethical dilemmas, especially for vulnerable research subjects. We present the case of a child with neurocognitive impairment who is diagnosed with COVID-19 infection after presenting with fever and a seizure. The child lives in a group home and is in the custody of the state; her parents lost parental rights many years ago. Some members of the health care team want to enroll her in a randomized clinical trial evaluating an experimental treatment of COVID-19. For minor patients to enroll in this clinical trial, the institutional review board requires assent of patients and consent of guardians. An ethics consult is called to help identify relevant concerns in enrollment. In the accompanying case discussion, we address historical perspectives on research involving people with disabilities; proper management of research participation for people with disabilities including consent by proxy, therapeutic misconception, and other threats to the ethical validity of clinical trials; and the potentially conflicting obligations of researchers and clinicians.","House, Samantha A; Shubkin, Catherine D; Lahey, Tim; Brosco, Jeffrey P; Lantos, John",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-010728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33028661/,15
152988,The CRISPR-Cas toolbox for analytical and diagnostic assay development.,2021-10-06,"OBJECTIVE To determine the influence of a stricter aseptic protocol on implant-associated infection (IAI) rates after tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO). STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SAMPLE POPULATION Seven hundred three dogs (811 TPLO). METHODS Medical records (2006-2014) of dogs with TPLO with a ≥18-month follow-up were reviewed. An established TPLO protocol was altered to include an iodophore-impregnated adhesive drape, cefazolin administration every 90 minutes intraoperatively and then every 4 hours until hospital discharge, orthopedic surgical gloves, triclosan-coated intradermal sutures (instead of staples), soft-padded bandage with mupirocin ointment, use of single-use gloves while handling treated dogs, and placement of an Elizabethan collar. Signalment, affected limb, protocol changes, IAI, time to explant, and culture and susceptibility results were recorded. Data were analyzed by using Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS TPLO plates were removed from 31 dogs (8.5% prechange, 1.3% postchange) because of a suspected IAI. Bacterial culture results from an explanted screw were positive in 26 dogs (7.4% prechange, 0.94% postchange). The odds ratio (OR) of IAI in the postchange cohort was decreased by 88% (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.05-0.33) compared with the prechange cohort, after controlling for variables. Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from all implants removed from IAI-positive postchange dogs, 4/5 of which were methicillin resistant. No methicillin-resistant isolates were grown from the prechange cohort implants. CONCLUSION The protocol tested here decreased IAI rates after TPLO, but most infections diagnosed after its implementation involved methicillin-resistant isolates. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The protocol reported here may be used as a guide in clinics seeking to reduce their IAI rates after TPLO. Postoperative infections after implementation of this protocol should be monitored to evaluate its potential impact on the emergence of antibiotic resistance.","Stine, Samantha L; Odum, Susan M; Mertens, W Daniel",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29878479/,15

We aim to develop and validate a concise prognostic nomogram for patients with minor stroke and TIA. METHODS A total of 994 patients with minor stroke and TIA were included. They were split into a derivation (n=746) and validation (n=248) cohort. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores 3 months after onset were used to assess the prognosis as unfavourable outcome (mRS≥2) or favourable outcome (mRS<2). RESULT The final model included seven independent predictors: gender, age, baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, white blood cell and serum uric acid. The Harrell's concordance index (C-index) of the nomogram for predicting the outcome was 0.775 (95% CI 0.735 to 0.814), which was confirmed by the validation cohort (C-index=0.787 (95% CI 0.722 to 0.853)). The calibration curve showed that the nomogram-based predictions were consistent with actual observation in both derivation cohort and validation cohort. CONCLUSION The proposed nomogram showed favourable predictive accuracy for minor stroke and TIA. This has the potential to contribute to clinical decision-making.","Lei, Zhihao; Li, Shuanglin; Feng, Hongye; Lai, Yupeng; Zhou, Yanxia; Li, Chao; Ren, Lijie",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-137680; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917776/,15

We amassed a global, spatiotemporal dataset describing parasite prevalence across 7346 wildlife populations and 2021 host-parasite combinations, compiling local weather and climate records at each location. We found that hosts from cool and warm climates experienced increased disease risk at abnormally warm and cool temperatures, respectively, as predicted by the thermal mismatch hypothesis. This effect was greatest in ectothermic hosts and similar in terrestrial and freshwater systems. Projections based on climate change models indicate that ectothermic wildlife hosts from temperate and tropical zones may experience sharp increases and moderate reductions in disease risk, respectively, though the magnitude of these changes depends on parasite identity.","Cohen, Jeremy M; Sauer, Erin L; Santiago, Olivia; Spencer, Samuel; Rohr, Jason R",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb1702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33214248/,15

155292,China Coronavirus Outbreak: All the Latest Updates.,2020-03-05,"BACKGROUND Ventral incisional hernia is a common problem after abdominal surgery. Most patients with these hernias present with greater omentum and gastrointestinal prolapse. However, hepatic herniation through a ventral incisional hernia is a rare phenomenon that has been seldom reported in the literature. We report the case of a ventral incisional hernia with hepatic herniation treated with laparoscopic repair. CASE PRESENTATION A 68-year-old Japanese women with a history of myocardial resection for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 1 year earlier was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of vomiting and epigastric pain. Physical examination showed a 4-cm epigastric mass. Abdominal computed tomography revealed left hepatic lobe herniation through the lower edge of a mid-sternal incision. We diagnosed the patient with a ventral incisional hernia with hepatic herniation. The patient underwent laparoscopic hernia repair. During an 18-month follow-up, no recurrence or symptoms have been observed. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of laparoscopic repair of ventral incisional hernias with hepatic herniation. Laparoscopic repair was useful and suitable for this rare herniation due to its minimally invasive nature and ability to achieve sufficient visibility of the surgical field. Laparoscopic repair could be a potential treatment option for elective surgery for this disease, which is often treated conservatively.","Misumi, Toshihiro; Nishihara, Masahiro; Sugino, Keizo; Kawasaki, Yukari",Journal of medical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-021-02682-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33573685/,15

This paper reviews the epidemiological situation of EIDs and RIDs of global concern in the EMR between 2001 and 2018. METHODS To do a narrative review, a complete list of studies in the field was we prepared following a systematic search approach. Studies that were purposively reviewed were identified to summarize the epidemiological situation of each targeted disease. A comprehensive search of all published studies on EIDs and RIDs between 2001 and 2018 was carried out through search engines including Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. RESULTS Leishmaniasis, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are reported from all countries in the region. Chikungunya, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), dengue fever, and H5N1 have been increasing in number, frequency, and expanding in their geographic distribution. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which was reported in this region in 2012 is still a public health concern. There are challenges to control cholera, diphtheria, leishmaniasis, measles, and poliomyelitis in some of the countries. Moreover, Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHF), and Rift Valley fever (RVF) are limited to some countries in the region. Also, there is little information about the real situation of the plague, Q fever, and tularemia. CONCLUSION EIDs and RIDs are prevalent in most countries in the region and could further spread within the region. It is crucial to improve regional capacities and capabilities in preventing and responding to disease outbreaks with adequate resources and expertise.","Mostafavi, Ehsan; Ghasemian, Abdolmajid; Abdinasir, Abubakar; Nematollahi Mahani, Seyed Alireza; Rawaf, Salman; Salehi Vaziri, Mostafa; Gouya, Mohammad Mahdi; Minh Nhu Nguyen, Tran; Al Awaidy, Salah; Al Ariqi, Lubna; Islam, Md Mazharul; Abu Baker Abd Farag, Elmoubasher; Obtel, Majdouline; Omondi Mala, Peter; Matar, Ghassan M; Asghar, Rana Jawad; Barakat, Amal; Sahak, Mohammad Nadir; Abdulmonem Mansouri, Mariam; Swaka, Alexandra",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2021.13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904695/,15

We assessed whether gbSS-28 targets Ca(2+) and/or protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent signaling cascades in inhibiting growth hormone (GH) release. gbSS-28 decreased basal GH release from primary cultures of dispersed goldfish pituitary cells and intracellular free calcium levels ([Ca(2+)](i)) in goldfish somatotropes. gbSS-28 partially reduced [Ca(2+)](i) and GH responses induced by two endogeneous gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRHs), salmon (s)GnRH and chicken (c)GnRH-II. Furthermore, gbSS-28 reduced GH increases and abolished [Ca(2+)](i) elevations elicited by two PKC activators, tetradecanoyl 4beta-phorbol-13-acetate and dioctanyl glycerol. The PKC inhibitors Gö6976 and Bis II abolished [Ca(2+)](i) responses to PKC activators, but only attenuated GnRH-induced increases in [Ca(2+)](i) and did not alter basal [Ca(2+)](i). In cells pretreated with Bis II, gbSS-28 further reduced basal [Ca(2+)](i). Our results suggest that gbSS-28 inhibits GnRH-induced GH release in part by attenuating PKC-mediated GnRH [Ca(2+)](i) signals. gbSS-28 reduces basal GH release also via reduction in [Ca(2+)](i) but PKC is not involved in this regard.","Yu, Y; Chang, J P",General and comparative endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2010.04.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20403359/,15

Its main disadvantage is its low specificity and elevated number of false positives. The aim of this study is to analyse the differences in immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) between the different groups of newborns (NB) with a positive neonatal screen depending on whether they were healthy, healthy carriers, affected by CF, or CFSPID (Cystic Fibrosis Screen Positive, Inconclusive Diagnosis). MATERIAL Retrospective analytical study of the concentrations of IRT in NB with a positive neonatal screen for CF born in a tertiary hospital during an 8-year period RESULTS: A total of 790 NB with a positive neonatal screen for CF were analysed. Of these 86.3% were term, 53% girls, and 11.8% were admitted. The mean IRT value was 79.16 ng/mL (range 60 - 367). Significantly higher concentrations of IRT were found in those affected by CF compared to the other groups (P<.001). There were higher levels in large prematures (P=.007) and admitted patients (P=.002). There were no differences as regards gender or season. There was a direct correlation of 64% (P=.001) between IRT and sweat test in those affected by CF and CFSPID. A cut-off value of IRT for the diagnosis of CF was calculated from the ROC curve (76.2 ng/mL (S=95.7%, Sp=64.5%). CONCLUSIONS NB with CF have significantly higher levels of IRT than healthy ones, or carriers and CFSPID. Prematurity and hospital admission may also have an influence. A higher IRT value is associated with a higher level in the sweat test.","Arrudi-Moreno, Marta; García-Romero, Ruth; Samper-Villagrasa, Pilar; Sánchez-Malo, María José; Martin-de-Vicente, Carlos",Anales de pediatria,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpedi.2020.04.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046410/,15
156554,SnapShot: β-Arrestin Functions.,2020-09-03,"A wireless ultrasound surgical system (WUSS) with battery modules requires efficient power consumption with appropriate cutting effects during surgical operations. Effective cutting performances of the ultrasound transducer (UT) should be produced for ultrasound surgical knives for effective hemostasis performance and efficient dissection time. Therefore, we implemented a custom-made UT with piezoelectric material and re-poling process, which is applied to enhance the battery power consumption and output amplitude performances of the WUSS. After the re-poling process of the UT, the quality factor increased from 1231.1 to 2418 to minimize the unwanted heat generation. To support this UT, we also developed a custom-made generator with a transformer and developed 2nd harmonic termination circuit, control microcontroller with an advanced reduced instruction set computer machine (ARM) controller, and battery management system modules to produce effective WUSS performances. The generator with a matching circuit in the WUSS showed a peak-to-peak output voltage and current amplitude of 166 V and 1.12 A, respectively, at the resonant frequency. The performance with non-contact optical vibrators was also measured. In the experimental data, the developed WUSS reduced power consumption by 3.6% and increased the amplitude by 20% compared to those of the commercial WUSS. Therefore, the improved WUSS performances could be beneficial for hemostatic performance and dissection time during surgical operation because of the developed UT with a piezoelectric material and re-poling process.","Kim, Jungsuk; You, Kiheum; Choe, Sun-Ho; Choi, Hojong",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20154165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726961/,15

On the other hand, necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a relatively rare, but life-threatening disease. The symptoms in cellulitis and NF are very similar. In this case report, we describe a case in which the diagnosis of NF in a lymphedematous limb was difficult. A 70-year-old woman had secondary lymphedema in bilateral legs and consulted our department. On the first day of lymphedema therapy, the patient complained of vomiting, diarrhea, and fever (37.7 °C) without local fever in the legs. She was diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis. On the next day, swelling and pain in her left leg occurred and her blood pressure was 59/44 mmHg. She was diagnosed with cellulitis accompanied by lower limb lymphedema and septic shock. On the second day, blisters appeared on the left leg, and computed tomography showed NF. We performed debridement under general anesthesia and her vital signs improved postoperatively. Streptococcus agalactiae (B) was detected in blood culture, and we administered bixillin and clindamycin. Postoperatively, necrosis in the skin and fat around the left ankle gradually spread, and it took 5 months to complete epithelialization.

We tested the hypothesis that the pandemic has disproportionately affected individuals with substance use disorder by evaluating average daily 911 ambulance calls for substance use-related issues compared with all other calls. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 911 ambulance calls before and after the start of COVID-19 in Massachusetts. We used consecutive samples of 911 ambulance calls, categorized into those which were substance-related or not. An interrupted time series analysis was performed to determine if there were changes in numbers of daily calls before a statewide declaration of emergency for COVID-19 (February 15-March 9, 2020), from the emergency declaration until a stay-at-home advisory (March 10-March 22, 2020) and following the stay-at-home advisory (March 23-May 15, 2020). Results: Compared with prior to the statewide emergency, the post-statewide emergency average of daily ambulance calls decreased from 2,453.2 to 1,969.6, a 19.7% decrease. Similarly, calls for substance-related reasons decreased by 16.4% compared with prior to the statewide emergency. However, despite an initial decrease in calls, after the stay-at-home advisory calls for substance use began increasing by 0.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4-1.1) calls/day, while calls for other reasons did not significantly change (+1.2 (95% CI -0.8 to 3.1) calls/day). Refusal of transport for substance-related calls increased from 5.0% before the statewide emergency to 7.5% after the declaration (p < 0.001). Conclusions: After an initial decline in substance-related ambulance calls following a statewide declaration of emergency, calls for substance use increased to pre-COVID-19 levels while those for other reasons remained at a lower rate. The results suggest that COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting individuals with substance use disorder.","Weiner, Scott G; Cash, Rebecca E; Hendricks, Michelle; El Ibrahimi, Sanae; Baker, Olesya; Seethala, Raghu R; Peters, Gregory; Goldberg, Scott A",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,https://doi.org/10.1080/10903127.2020.1845420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33147081/,15
158529,"Cell-penetrating peptides: design, synthesis, and applications.",2014,"OBJECTIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality worldwide, so far there is no ideal treatment method. Previous studies have shown that hydrogen (H2) is involved in the treatment of COPD as an antioxidant. In this study, the effect of H2 on M1/M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages in COPD rats was observed, and its anti-inflammatory mechanism was further elucidated. Methods: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups including the control, COPD and H2 group. A rat model of COPD was established by cigarette exposure combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction. H2 therapy was administered 2 hours per day for 14 days. Lung function and pathology were assessed. The levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and IL-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA, protein expression and immunoreactivity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase (Arg)-1 in lung were observed by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results: Compared with the control rats, there were a significant decline in lung function, a marked inflammatory infiltration and pulmonary parenchymal remodeling and the increases of IL-6, TNF-α and TGF-β1 levels in BALF and lung tissue, but a lower expression of IL-10 in COPD rats. The iNOS mRNA and protein expression, as well as its optical density (OD), were increased significantly in lung tissue, while those of Arg-1 decreased significantly. H2 treatment improved the lung function and the parenchymal inflammation, reversed the increased levels of IL-6, TNF-α and TGF-β1, and the lower IL-10. Meanwhile, H2 also down-regulated the expression of iNOS, but up-regulated expression of Arg-1 in lung tissue. Conclusion: H2 reduces inflammation in the lung of COPD, which may be related to its inhibition of M1 type polarization and activation of M2 type polarization of alveolar macrophage.","Su, Jing-Chao; Zhang, Yi; Cheng, Chen; Zhu, Yi-Nan; Ye, Yu-Meng; Sun, Yong-Kang; Xiang, Shui-Ying; Wang, Yuan; Liu, Zi-Bing; Zhang, Xin-Fang",Experimental lung research,https://doi.org/10.1080/01902148.2021.1919788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34282696/,15
158670,UnaG as a reporter in AAV-mediated gene transfer for biomedical imaging.,2020-09-07,"PURPOSE Radionuclide imaging of insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression in tumours might be used for selection of patients who would benefit from IGF-1R-targeted therapy. We have previously shown the feasibility of IGF-1R imaging using the Affibody molecule (111)In-DOTA-His(6)-Z(IGF1R:4551). The use of (99m)Tc instead of (111)In should improve sensitivity and resolution of imaging, and reduce the dose burden to patients. We hypothesized that inclusion of a HEHEHE tag instead of a His(6) tag in Z(IGF1R:4551) would permit its convenient purification using IMAC, enable labelling with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+), and improve its biodistribution. METHODS Z(IGF1R:4551) was expressed with a HEHEHE tag in the N terminus. The resulting (HE)(3)-Z(IGF1R:4551) construct was labelled with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+). Targeting of IGF-1R-expressing cells using [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+)-(HE)(3)-Z(IGF1R:4551) was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS (HE)(3)-Z(IGF1R:4551) was stably labelled with (99m)Tc with preserved specific binding to IGF-1R-expressing DU-145 prostate cancer cells in vitro. In mice, [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+)-(HE)(3)-Z(IGF1R:4551) accumulated in IGF-1R-expressing organs (pancreas, stomach, lung and salivary gland). [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+)-(HE)(3)-Z(IGF1R:4551) demonstrated 3.6-fold lower accumulation in the liver and spleen than (111)In-DOTA-Z(IGF1R:4551). In NMRI nu/nu mice with DU-145 prostate cancer xenografts, the tumour uptake was 1.32 ± 0.11 %ID/g and the tumour-to-blood ratio was 4.4 ± 0.3 at 8 h after injection. The xenografts were visualized using a gamma camera 6 h after injection. CONCLUSION (99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+)-(HE)(3)-Z(IGF1R:4551) is a promising candidate for visualization of IGF-1R expression in malignant tumours.","Orlova, Anna; Hofström, Camilla; Strand, Joanna; Varasteh, Zohreh; Sandstrom, Mattias; Andersson, Karl; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Gräslund, Torbjörn",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-012-2284-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23179942/,15

However, there is no consensus on the ideal suture material and technique. This study was conducted to compare the tensile strength, repair time, and characteristics of 4-strand cruciate, modified Kessler, and 4-strand horizontal intrafiber barbed sutures for flexor tenorrhaphy with a 12-mm suture purchase length in an animal model. METHODS The right third deep flexors of 60 adult Leghorn chicken feet were isolated and repaired with a 12-mm suture purchase length. The tendons were randomly assigned to three groups of equal number (n=20 each). Groups 1 and 2 received 4-strand cruciate and modified Kessler repair with conventional suture materials, respectively. A 4-strand horizontal intrafiber barbed suture technique was used in group 3. The repaired tendons were biomechanically tested for tensile strength, 2-mm gap resistance, and mode of failure. Repair times were also recorded. RESULTS The maximum tensile strength until failure was 44.6±4.3 N in group 1, 35.7±5.2 N in group 2, and 56.7±17.3 N in group 3. The barbed sutures were superior to the other sutures in terms of the load needed for 2-mm gap formation (P<0.05). Furthermore, the barbed sutures showed the shortest repair time (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS This study found that 4-strand horizontal intrafiber barbed suture repair with a 12-mm purchase length in a chicken flexor tendon injury model showed promising biomechanical properties and took less time to perform than other options.","Çolak, Özlem; Kankaya, Yüksel; Sungur, Nezih; Özer, Kadri; Gürsoy, Koray; Şerbetçi, Kemal; Koçer, Uğur",Archives of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.5999/aps.2018.00962; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913576/,15

Despite these robust correlations, it is unclear whether family income is the cause of differences observed between children growing up in poverty and their more fortunate peers or whether these differences are merely due to the many other aspects of family life that co-occur with poverty. Baby's First Years is the first randomized controlled trial in the United States designed to identify the causal impact of poverty reduction on children's early development. A total of 1000 low-income mothers of newborns were enrolled in the study and began receiving a monthly unconditional cash gift for the first several years of their children's lives. Mothers were randomly assigned to receive either a large monthly cash gift or a nominal monthly cash gift. All monthly gifts are administered via debit card and can be freely spent with no restrictions. Baby's First Years aims to answer whether poverty reduction in early childhood (1) improves children's developmental outcomes and promotes healthier brain functioning, and (2) improves family functioning and better enables parents to support child development.

This study is conducted to explore nurses' perceptions of the co-worker support as psychological resource in the workplace. METHOD The present study is a qualitative research. Fourteen staff nurses who were working in hospitals affiliated to the Khoy University of Medical Sciences, Iran were selected based on purposeful sampling and interviewed using un-structured in-depth interviews. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using conventional content analysis approach through constant comparative method. RESULTS Data analysis revealed four major themes with 11 sub themes. The four major themes include 'emotional support', 'effective working relationship and collaboration', 'suitable social relationships', and 'guidance and teaching'. CONCLUSION The results showed that, nurses had a positive perception of their colleagues' support in the workplace. Co-worker Support is a multidimensional phenomenon and is influenced by various factors. Perceiving support from the colleague and having a sense of support can promote the quality of care and increase dealing with stressful situations in nursing. Therefore, communication and flexibility skills should be taught to both staff and managers in this regard.","Sodeify, Roghieh; Habibpour, Zeinab",Enfermeria clinica,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.04.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680793/,15

Comorbidities of pemphigoid have not been well-described. Identification of comorbidities associated with pemphigoid is important to decrease morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE To identify the comorbid health conditions of bullous pemphigoid. METHODS This was a case-control study of 91 cases of pemphigoid verified by clinical and laboratory diagnosis and 546 age- and sex-matched controls with complete follow-up at a large metropolitan quaternary care medical center. RESULTS The average age of bullous pemphigoid patients was 76 years and 53% of patients were female. Forty-eight (53%) of the BP patients had a history of inpatient hospitalization, of which 22 (24.2%) were hospitalized for either previously undiagnosed BP or an exacerbation of BP. Bullous pemphigoid was significantly associated with hypertension [adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval)]: [2.03 (1.24-3.32)], diabetes mellitus [2.59 (1.60-4.19)], chronic kidney disease [2.29 (1.19-4.40)], end-stage renal disease [3.82 (1.48-9.85)], basal cell carcinoma of the skin [6.00 (1.94-18.6)], and obstructive sleep apnea [5.23 (2.45-11.19)]. 78% of BP patients used at least one systemic immunosuppressant. There was no significant association between treatments for pemphigoid and any of the comorbidities.

It involves adduction of the metatarsals at the Lisfranc joint. A systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the following question: What tools are used to identify and quantify metatarsus adductus and how reliable, valid and responsive are they? Methods The following electronic databases were searched for studies describing tools for the identification and quantification of metatarsus adductus in adults and children published from inception to June 2016: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science and AMED. Two researchers initially searched all articles by screening titles and abstracts. If there was any doubt as to an article's eligibility, the full text paper was retrieved. Reference lists and citations of all retained studies were examined in an attempt to locate further studies. Articles were excluded if they were not in English or described other congenital foot conditions that did not include metatarsus adductus. Studies included in the review reporting measurement properties of measurement tools were critically appraised using the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) critical appraisal tool. Results There were 282 articles screened by title and abstract and 28 articles screened from full text. Fifteen articles were included and nine had data that were extractable for appraisal using the COSMIN critical appraisal tool. Techniques to measure metatarsus adductus included the heel bisector method, photocopies, ultrasound, footprints, dynamic foot pressure and radiographs. There was a paucity of quality data reporting the reliability, validity or responsiveness for measuring metatarsus adductus. Several radiographic angles showed good reliability (intraclass correlation (ICC) - 0.84, 0.97) in adults during pre-operative planning. Conclusion There have been multiple assessment techniques proposed for quantification of metatarsus adductus, but there is paucity of reliability, validity or responsiveness to measurement data about these techniques, especially in relation to the paediatric population. Further consideration of measurement testing is required to determine if the most common non-radiographic measures of metatarsus adductus are acceptable for clinical use.","Marshall, Nicole; Ward, Emily; Williams, Cylie M",Journal of foot and ankle research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13047-018-0268-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29881466/,15
161573,Current Trends in Enzyme Inhibition and Docking Analysis in Drug Design-Part-IV.,2021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS The role of radiation therapy in the treatment of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is controversial. Randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable PDA have reported mixed results, with effects ranging from modest benefit to worse outcomes compared with control therapies. We investigated whether radiation causes inflammatory cells to acquire an immune-suppressive phenotype that limits the therapeutic effects of radiation on invasive PDAs and accelerates progression of preinvasive foci. METHODS We investigated the effects of radiation therapy in p48(Cre);LSL-Kras(G12D) (KC) and p48(Cre);LSLKras(G12D);LSL-Trp53(R172H) (KPC) mice, as well as in C57BL/6 mice with orthotopic tumors grown from FC1242 cells derived from KPC mice. Some mice were given neutralizing antibodies against macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1 or MCSF) or F4/80. Pancreata were exposed to doses of radiation ranging from 2 to 12 Gy and analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS Pancreata of KC mice exposed to radiation had a higher frequency of advanced pancreatic intraepithelial lesions and more foci of invasive cancer than pancreata of unexposed mice (controls); radiation reduced survival time by more than 6 months. A greater proportion of macrophages from radiation treated invasive and preinvasive pancreatic tumors had an immune-suppressive, M2-like phenotype compared with control mice. Pancreata from mice exposed to radiation had fewer CD8(+) T cells than controls, and greater numbers of CD4(+) T cells of T-helper 2 and T-regulatory cell phenotypes. Adoptive transfer of T cells from irradiated PDA to tumors of control mice accelerated tumor growth. Radiation induced production of MCSF by PDA cells. A neutralizing antibody against MCSF prevented radiation from altering the phenotype of macrophages in tumors, increasing the anti-tumor T-cell response and slowing tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS Radiation treatment causes macrophages murine PDA to acquire an immune-suppressive phenotype and disabled T-cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. MCSF blockade negates this effect, allowing radiation to have increased efficacy in slowing tumor growth.","Seifert, Lena; Werba, Gregor; Tiwari, Shaun; Giao Ly, Nancy Ngoc; Nguy, Susanna; Alothman, Sara; Alqunaibit, Dalia; Avanzi, Antonina; Daley, Donnele; Barilla, Rocky; Tippens, Daniel; Torres-Hernandez, Alejandro; Hundeyin, Mautin; Mani, Vishnu R; Hajdu, Cristina; Pellicciotta, Ilenia; Oh, Philmo; Du, Kevin; Miller, George",Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2016.02.070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26946344/,15

The mechanisms explaining this excess in disease burden in males are unknown. Innate immune responses are likely critical in protection against a novel virus like SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesised that innate immune responses may be deficient in males relative to females. To test this we stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from participants in a population-based birth cohort with three respiratory viruses (rhinoviruses-RV-A16 and RV-A1, and respiratory syncytial virus-RSV) and two viral mimics (R848 and CpG-A, to mimic responses to SARS-CoV-2). We measured interferon (IFN) and IFN-induced chemokine responses and investigated sex differences in virus-induced responses. IFN-, IFN-{beta} and IFN-{gamma} responses to RV-A16 were deficient in males compared to females, fold-inductions being 1.92-fold (P<0.001), 2.04-fold (P<0.001) and 1.77-fold (P=0.003) lower in males than females, respectively. Similar significant deficiencies in innate immune responses were observed in males for eleven other cytokine-stimulus pairs. Responses in males were greater than those in females in only one of 35 cytokine-stimulus pairs investigated. Review of healthcare records revealed that 12.1% of males but only 6.6% of females were admitted to hospital with respiratory infections in the first year of life (P=0.017). Impaired innate anti-viral immunity in males likely results in high morbidity and mortality from respiratory viruses including COVID-19. Males may preferentially benefit from therapies that boost innate anti-viral immune responses.","Regis, E.; Fontanella, S.; Lin, L.; Howard, R.; Haider, S.; Curtin, J. A.; Edwards, M.

Public libraries typically offer patrons free access to broadband. Libraries, particularly those in rural regions, need to be evaluated as a site for patients to connect to a health care provider over a video visit. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the technological readiness of public libraries to provide telemedicine support and to determine differences in readiness between rural and urban public libraries. Methods: We distributed a survey to members of the Virginia Library Association to evaluate technological readiness of Virginia public libraries to support telemedicine use in their facilities. The survey evaluated availability and speed of fixed broadband internet access, physical equipment, and private space for each library. Results: Respondents from 39 libraries completed the survey, approximately one-third of which were in rural or small urban areas. All respondents reported fixed broadband, at least four computers, and available staff to assist who technology in their libraries. Eighty-five percent of surveyed libraries reported sufficient broadband speed and a private room available to patrons. There were no significant differences between rural and urban status for any of the library characteristics. Discussion: Public libraries in Virginia are technologically ready to support patrons connecting to health care providers over telemedicine.

Robust correlates of severe COVID-19 include old age, male sex, poverty and co-morbidities such as obesity, diabetes or cardiovascular disease. A precise knowledge is still lacking of the molecular and biological mechanisms that may explain the association of severe disease with male sex. Here, we show that testosterone trajectories are highly accurate individual predictors (AUC of ROC = 0.928, p < 0.0001) of survival in male COVID-19 patients. Longitudinal determinations of blood levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and androstenedione suggest an early modest inhibition of the central LH-androgen biosynthesis axis in a majority of patients, followed by either full recovery in survivors or a peripheral failure in lethal cases. Moreover, failure to reinstate physiological testosterone levels was associated with evidence of impaired T helper differentiation and decrease of non-classical monocytes. The strong association of recovery or failure to reinstate testosterone levels with survival or death from COVID-19 in male patients is suggestive of a significant role of testosterone status in the immune responses to COVID-19.","Toscano-Guerra, E.; Martinez-Gallo, M.; Arrese-Munoz, I.; Gine, A.; Diaz, N.; Gabriel-Medina, P.; Riveiro-Barciela, M.; Labrador-Horrillo, M.; Martinez-Valle, F.; Hernandez-Gonzalez, M.; Rodriguez-Frias, F.; Pujol Borrell, R.; Ferrer, R.; Thomson, T.

Epidemics affect people's daily consumption activities, for example, by causing them to shop less, travel less, consume less and invest less. The reduction of a large number of economic activities leads to the suppression of social demand and the reduction of consumption level, which further affects the GDP of various countries around the world. It is necessary to investigate and analyze the impact of the epidemic on GDP in order to control and analyze the economic situation under the impact of the epidemic. In this paper, we take the impact of COVID-19 on the GDP of each country as a regression problem, and propose to forecast GDP through feature engineering combined with Aaboost model. The model was tested on more than 50, 000 data records from more than 200 countries provided by the Kaggle platform to prove the validity.

The coronavirus surface spike (S) glycoprotein is a class I fusion with a S1 domain which is attached to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and a S2 domain which enables fusion with the host cell membrane and internalization of the virus. Curcumin has been suggested as a potential drug to control inflammation and as a potential inhibitor of S protein, but its therapeutic effects are hampered by poor bioavailability. We performed a molecular docking and dynamic study using 94 curcumin analogues designed to have improved metabolic stability against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and compared their affinity with curcumin and other potential inhibitors. The docking analysis suggested that the S2 domain is the main target of these compounds and compound 2606 displayed a higher binding affinity (-9.6 kcal mol-1) than curcumin (-6.8 kcal mol-1) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug hydroxychloroquine (-6.3 kcal mol-1).

This non-contact sensing modality can drive various applications from cardiac health, sleep, and emotion management. Under the circumstance of the COVID-19 pandemic, non-contact heart monitoring receives increasingly market demands. However, existing wireless heart monitoring schemes can only detect limited heart activities, such as heart rate, fiducial points, and Seismocardiography (SCG)-like information. In this paper, we present CardiacWave to enable a non-contact high-definition heart monitoring. CardiacWave can provide a full spectrum of Electrocardiogram (ECG)-like heart activities, including the details of P-wave, T-wave, and QRS complex. Specifically, CardiacWave is built upon the Cardiac-mmWave scattering effect (CaSE), which is a variable frequency response of the cardiac electromagnetic field under the mmWave interrogation. The CardiacWave design consists of a noise-resistant sensing scheme to interrogate CaSE and a cardiac activity profiling module for extracting cardiac electrical activities from the interrogation response. Our experiments show that the CardiacWave-induced ECG measures have a high positive correlation with the heart activity ground truth (i.e., measurements from a medical-grade instrument). The timing difference of P-waves, T-waves, and QRS complex is 0.67%, 0.71%, and 0.49%, respectively, and a mean cardiac event difference is within a delay of 5.3 milliseconds. These results indicate that CaridacWave offers high-fidelity and integral heart clinical characteristics. Furthermore, we evaluate the CardiacWave system with participants under various conditions, including heart and breath rates, ages, and heart habits (e.g., tobacco use). © 2021 ACM.","Xu, C.; Li, H.; Li, Z.; Zhang, H.; Rathore, A.

We are living in the era of big data, artificial intelligence and also virtual reality which are changing the paradigm of all our living including education. As far as communication within multidisciplinary and multinational working teams is concerned, English has become a preferable language that is used worldwide including academia and research. In non-English speaking countries Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have faced very similar challenge how to foster establishing English Education Environment (EEE). Most of their students speak different language and their level of English competence differs. Likewise, disciplinary teachers’ (DTs’) English competence and readiness to teach their courses in English vary. This contribution describes the project (Visegrad+) of HEIs from Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Albania and Serbia, intended to study if Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) and close cooperation between ESP/CLIL experts and DTs can result in effective English learning-teaching environment. The main project outcome – web platform for ESP/ CLIL and DTs communities is presented.

In addition to domestic returns and foreign returns, ‘pull factors’ of COVID-19 pandemic in host country and ‘push factors’ of COVID-19 pandemic in home country were used to explain net foreign inflows. We find that ‘push factors’ of COVID-19 in home country are dominant in explaining the reduction of net foreign inflows in five out of 11 sectors, and ‘pull factors’ of domestic returns are dominant in explaining net foreign inflows in most sectors. The price impact of net foreign flows differs across sectors as well. A strong negative correlation between net foreign outflows and same-day return could be identified in the Financials sector. On the flip side, positive correlation between net foreign inflows and same-day return could be identified in seven other sectors. Finally, a pattern of flight-to-liquidity was discovered, as foreign institutional investors strategically sell illiquid stocks to conserve liquidity when market uncertainty is heightened.","Zhang, Jinhua Mao Rui Wang Jieyu Xing Mengying",Pacific-Basin Finance Journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pacfin.2021.101618,15

Method: Young adults were recruited through the College Diabetes Network community. Participants completed the validated, 4-item, short-form Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) virtually, using two recall periods: 'during the past month' and 'prior to the pandemic'. Paired-samples t-tests and Pearson's correlations were used for analyses. Results: The survey was completed by 375 participants (mean age 22.4±3.2 years, 79% female) in October 2020. Total DDS scores and individual items were significantly higher at the time of the survey compared to prior to the pandemic (all p<.001;see figure below). Additionally, 46% of participants retrospectively endorsed a score above the cutoff for high distress prior to the pandemic, while 54% endorsed a score above the cutoff in the last month. High diabetes distress in the past month was associated with higher self-reported HbA1c (r=.25, p<.001). Conclusions: Young adults report their diabetes distress has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the importance of mental health support for young adults with diabetes during this time.

168396,Emergence of evidence during disease outbreaks: lessons learnt from the Zika virus outbreak,2020-03-18,"We show that the odds of the mass-gap (secondary) object in GW190814 being a neutron star (NS) improve if one allows for a stiff high-density equation of state (EoS) or a large spin. Since its mass is $\in (2.50,2.67) M_{\odot}$, establishing its true nature will make it either the heaviest NS or the lightest black hole (BH), and can have far-reaching implications on NS EoS and compact object formation channels. When limiting oneself to the NS hypothesis, we deduce the secondary's properties by using a Bayesian framework with a hybrid EoS formulation that employs a parabolic expansion-based nuclear empirical parameterization around the nuclear saturation density augmented by a generic 3-segment piecewise polytrope (PP) model at higher densities and combining a variety of astrophysical observations. For the slow-rotation scenario, GW190814 implies a very stiff EoS and a stringent constraint on the EoS specially in the high-density region. On the other hand assuming the secondary object is a rapidly rotating NS, we constrain its rotational frequency to be $f=1170^{+389}_{-495}$ Hz, within a $90\%$ confidence interval. In this scenario, the secondary object in GW190814 would qualify as the fastest rotating NS ever observed. However, for this scenario to be viable, rotational instabilities would have to be suppressed both during formation and the subsequent evolution until merger, otherwise the secondary of GW190814 is more likely to be a BH.","Biswas, Bhaskar; Nandi, Rana; Char, Prasanta; Bose, Sukanta; Stergioulas, Nikolaos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02090v3.pdf,15

It was spread out an email for all students with a link for an online form, which includes sociodemographic questions, a screening question of the anxiety level, and the need for support level (rating scales 0-10).ResultsIt was obtained 36 answers from mostly female students (92%) with 17 to 21 years old (67%). Answers present an average anxiety level of 5.4 (Min=1;Max=9;SD=2.23), with 58% of answers with a score of anxiety level of 5 or higher. The need for support average was 3.7 (Min=1;Max=9;SD=2.23), with 33% of answers with a score of 5 or higher.ConclusionsIt is necessary to continuously monitor the anxiety level and the need for support of college students during the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. It is similarly relevant to have responses of HEI to promote mental health and to answer to the high levels of students’ anxiety and needs for support during the pandemic.","Torres, A.; Melo, R.; Príncipe, F.; Ferreira, A.; Quesado, A.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.791,15

169646,"Verification of inactivation effect of deep-ultraviolet LEDs on bacteria and viruses, and consideration of effective irradiation methods",2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the causative agent of COVID-19, now represents the sixth Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)-as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2009. Considering that SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted via the mucosal route, a therapy administered by this same route may represent a desirable approach to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is now widely accepted that genetically modified microorganisms, including probiotics, represent attractive vehicles for oral or nasal mucosal delivery of therapeutic molecules. Previous studies have shown that the mucosal administration of therapeutic molecules is able to induce an immune response mediated by specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies along with mucosal cell-mediated immune responses, which effectively concur to neutralize and eradicate infections. Therefore, advances in the modulation of mucosal immune responses, and in particular the use of probiotics as live delivery vectors, may encourage prospective studies to assess the effectiveness of genetically modified probiotics for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Emerging trends in the ever-progressing field of vaccine development re-emphasize the contribution of adjuvants, along with optimization of codon usage (when designing a synthetic gene), expression level, and inoculation dose to elicit specific and potent protective immune responses. In this review, we will highlight the existing pre-clinical and clinical information on the use of genetically modified microorganisms in control strategies against respiratory and non-respiratory viruses. In addition, we will discuss some controversial aspects of the use of genetically modified probiotics in modulating the cross-talk between mucosal delivery of therapeutics and immune system modulation.","Taghinezhad-S, S.; Mohseni, A.

169911,Molecular architecture of the human tRNA ligase complex,2021-07-11,"The role of innovation in the ongoing success of sport organizations is undeniable. Innovation, defined as new and distinct programs, services, or business practices, can help organizations compete, remain relevant to stakeholders, and/or help them achieve objectives effectively and efficiently (Hoeber, Doherty, Hoeber, & Wolfe, 2015;Naraine, 2019;Winand, Rihoux, Robinson, & Zintz, 2012). Innovation is particularly important for sport organizations that face significant competition or demands for change (Legg, Snelgrove, & Wood, 2016;Ratten, 2016), or seek to address wickedly persistent social problems (Misener & Misener, 2017;Svensson, & Hambrick, 2019). The aim of this special issue was to create a collection of case studies that challenge students to consider how to design and implement innovative practices to achieve organizational objectives and solve pressing social problems. The case studies contained in this special issue demonstrate the potential for innovation to exist in all substantive and functional areas of sport management such as marketing, sales, event management, strategic management, research methods, sport development, organizational behavior, human resources, social justice, sport-for-development, and program evaluation. Furthermore, the contexts of the cases are wide ranging and include professional sport, sport-for-development, youth sport, collegiate sport, and sport events, making them of interest to students with varying interests. The case study by Armentrout and colleagues focuses on FanStand, the maker of an app used by professional sport organizations to connect with live spectators. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the app is not being used while live games are canceled or played in front of minimal to no crowds. Although arenas and stadiums will soon reach full capacity, this case challenges students to consider different ways that sports app makers, like FanStand, can diversify revenue streams by leveraging stakeholder relationships and integrating the latest digital technology and consumer trends. Instructors teaching undergraduate courses on sport marketing or strategic management of sport organizations may be particularly interested in using this case study. McSweeney et al. introduce students to the potential use of technological innovation to transform the ways that a sport-for-development organization delivers its programming around the world. Although the need to innovate program delivery is spurred by COVID-19, the lessons that can be learned through the use of this case study extend beyond the pandemic because solutions have the potential to extend the scope of the organization’s impact given limited resources. Instructors teaching a course on undergraduate or graduate sport-for-development will especially appreciate this case study because it challenges students to consider the design of suitable solutions based on varying objectives, geographical contexts, and organizational capacities. The problem of declining ticket sales to the University of Minnesota’s men’s hockey games is presented in Warren’s case study. Students are placed into the role of a sales and marketing consultant who is challenged with the task of analyzing quantitative and qualitative data to develop consumer focused solutions using a design thinking approach. Instructors of undergraduate courses on sport marketing or sport sales will appreciate the ability to have their students make data-driven decisions using an established framework for generating innovative solutions. The challenge of selling tickets to collegiate sports games is enduring and not unique to men’s hockey at Minnesota, thereby offering instructors and students an opportunity to discuss how approaches to this issue may be similar or different across contexts. As the pool of referees continues to age and young officials do not replace them at a similar rate, many youth sport organizations are seeking to address the issue before a crisis is reached. The case authored by Pierce and colleagues present multiple problem spaces that can be implicated in the challenge of recruiting and retaining referees in youth sport using a well-described approach to design thinking. Instructors of capstone courses at the undergraduate or graduate level will appreciate the breadth of the case, whereas undergraduate course instructors of strategic management or research methods may choose to focus on one of the problem spaces. Students are challenged to go beyond the case to acquire data to be used in the design thinking process, making this case suitable for use over an extended period of time. Bodin and colleagues address another pressing issue in youth sport through their case on youth baseball set in the context of a national sport organization in Canada. The case challenges students to address the issue of declining participation in organized youth baseball through the implementation of an initiative that leverages the trend toward less organized and rule-bound forms of sport. The supplementary materials included with the case provide students with either raw data collected via surveys, interviews, and focus groups from stakeholders of a pilot project on a proposed initiative or a summary analysis of the data. This case will be particularly appealing to instructors of undergraduate courses on program evaluation, research methods, or sport development, who can task students with analyzing the data to make recommendations about the future use or modification of the initiative country wide. When a professional sport league expands, a number of management processes are needed to form and develop a new organization. One of these tasks is building a team of executives and staff who can thrive in a competitive environment through forward thinking. In their case, Zvosec and colleagues present this challenge to students who take on the role of the new President of Business Operations for the Nashville Comets of Major League Baseball. Students are tasked with building a front-office culture that is focused on innovation and long-term growth. This case is particularly suitable for undergraduate courses on organizational behavior or human resources. Finally, in the case authored by Rich and colleagues, students are presented with an opportunity to consider how the upcoming hosting of a major sport event can be leveraged to foster inclusion for LGBTQ2+ individuals in the host community. As diversity and inclusion continue to become important social issues, this case provides students with a unique approach to achieving social impact through events. Instructors of courses on event management or social justice oriented courses at the undergraduate or graduate level will be particularly interested in this case. Case studies continue to serve as an important pedagogical tool that can bring organizational and social problems to life in sport management courses and put students in the roles of key decision makers (Snelgrove, Wood, & Wigfield, 2020). Integrating innovation-focused cases into sport management courses, such as the ones found in this special issue, will encourage students to bring new ideas to pressing problems and develop the foundations of competitive sport organizations.

The information that the VIPER rover provides will help improve understanding of the composition, distribution, and accessibility of Lunar polar volatiles and will help determine how the Moon's resources can support future human space exploration. VIPER, however, represents a radical departure from the way that NASA has traditionally developed planetary robotic missions. A key consequence of these differences is that estimating the cost of VIPER's rover software is challenging and complex. For example, VIPER is being developed using management procedures typically applied to NASA research and technology projects, rather than space flight programs. In addition, key portions of the rover's software are being designed as ground software to run on mission control computers (rather than onboard the rover as flight software as with prior planetary missions) taking advantage of continuous, interactive data communications between the Moon and Earth and higher performance computing available on the ground. Moreover, the rover's software is being engineered using Agile software development practices and incorporates a significant amount of open-source code, rather than following traditional (spiral, waterfall, etc.) development methods and in-house code. In this paper, we present an innovative process to estimate the life cycle cost of VIPER's rover software. We first describe how we modeled the architecture and code counts for three software elements: Rover Flight Software (RFSW), Rover Ground Software (RGSW), and Rover Simulation Software (RSIM). We then discuss key challenges and unique aspects of our approach, such as the lack of Lunar rover analogies, the need to integrate and test large open source software, and the strategies developed to account for use of non-space flight management practices and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conclude with a summary of our results, including cumulative distribution, nearest neighbors and cluster analysis, as well as heuristics used to confirm the reasonableness of the cost estimate. © 2021 IEEE.","Stukes, S.; Allan, M.; Bajjalieh, G.; Deans, M.; Fong, T.; Hihn, J.; Utz, H.","2021 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/aero50100.2021.9438347,15

However, a unique presentation of a transient form of hepatitis in pediatric age group occurring subsequent to the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is yet to be reported in children. Presently the clinical work, temporal association and characteristics different than MIS-C of the cases of CAHC is being dealt with. Methods: As a retrospective and follow up observational study we reviewed all pediatric patients presenting with acute hepatitis during the study period from April 2021 to mid- June 2021. We observed a sudden rise of features of hepatitis in a group of pediatric patients during the second wave of SARS CoV-2 infections, where children or adolescents developing sudden onset acute hepatitis with no history of pre-existing liver disease in the absence of familiar etiology of acute hepatitis and with a recent 3-6 week history of RT-PCR positivity or a retrospectively proven Covid-19 infection with high titer SARS CoV-2 antibodies. Such patients had asymptomatic Covid-19 infection, while another very small group (n=8) patients having findings similar to MIS-C was identified with protracted and grave presentation, having multiple organ involvement along with Covid-19 diagnosis. Routine lab workup along with viral serology of acute hepatitis was performed in all such patients. These patients were negative for Hepatitis A, B, C and E but had high titer of SARS CoV-2 antibodies. Results: Among 33 patients who presented with hepatitis, 25 patients showed unique features of CAHC, they had hepatitis only. These patients did not have any typical Covid-19 symptoms, had normal to borderline inflammatory markers, with admission to general care wards, all recovered on supportive treatment without any complications or mortality. Whereas patients with MIS-C (n=8) required admission to critical care, they had high level of inflammatory markers and 3 (37.5%) had an adverse outcome. Conclusion: With emergence of newer variants of concern such as the Delta variant which caused the massive wave of Covid-19 in India, with varied presentations, CAHC is one of them. Such new entities need to be timely identified and differentiated from other types of emerging syndromes in children for appropriate management.","Rawat, S. K.; Asati, A. a.; Jain, A.; Ratho, R.

172249,Application of ultraviolet light sources for in vivo disinfection - IOPscience,2021,"Digital contact tracing applications (CTAs) have been one of the most widely discussed technical methods of controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. The effectiveness of this technology and its ethical justification depend highly on public acceptance and adoption. This study aims to describe the current knowledge about public acceptance of CTAs and identify individual perspectives, which are essential to consider concerning CTA acceptance and adoption. In this scoping review, 25 studies from four continents across the globe are compiled, and critical topics are identified and discussed. The results show that public acceptance varies across national cultures and sociodemographic strata. Lower acceptance among people who are mistrusting, socially disadvantaged, or those with low technical skills suggest a risk that CTAs may amplify existing inequities. Regarding determinants of acceptance, eight themes emerged, covering both attitudes and behavioral perspectives that can influence acceptance, including trust, privacy concerns, social responsibility, perceived health threat, experience of and access to technologies, performance expectancy and perceived benefits, and understanding. Furthermore, widespread misconceptions about the CTA function are a topic in need of immediate attention to ensure the safe use of CTAs. The intention-action gap is another topic in need of more research.","Villius Zetterholm, My Lin Yanqing Jokela Päivi",Informatics,https://doi.org/10.3390/informatics8030048,15

Variants in IFIH1, a gene coding the cytoplasmatic RNA sensor MDA5, regulate the response to viral infections. Objective: To characterize the impact of IFIH1 rs199076 variants on host response and outcomes after severe COVID-19. Methods: Patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed COVID-19 were prospectively studied and rs1990760 variants determined. Peripheral blood gene expression, cell populations and immune mediators were measured. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers were exposed to an MDA5 agonist and dexamethasone ex-vivo, and changes in gene expression assessed. ICU discharge and hospital death were modelled using rs1990760 variants and dexamethasone as factors in this cohort and in-silico clinical trials. Measurements and Main Results: 227 patients were studied. Patients with the IFIH1 rs1990760 TT variant showed a lower expression of inflammation-related pathways, an anti-inflammatory cell profile and lower concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators. Cells with TT variant exposed to a MDA5 agonist showed an increase in IL6 expression after dexamethasone treatment. All patients with the TT variant not treated with steroids (N=14) survived their ICU stay (HR 2.49, 95% confidence interval 1.29-4.79). Patients with a TT variant treated with dexamethasone (N=50) showed an increased hospital mortality (HR 2.19, 95% confidence interval 1.01-4.87) and serum IL-6. In-silico clinical trials supported these findings. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with the IFIH1 rs1990760 TT variant show an attenuated inflammatory response and better outcomes. Dexamethasone may reverse this anti-inflammatory phenotype.","Amado-Rodriguez, L.; Salgado del Riego, E.; Gomez de Ona, J.; Lopez-Alonso, I.; Gil-Pena, H.; Lopez-Martinez, C.; Martin-Vicente, P.; Lopez-Vazquez, A.; Gonzalez Lopez, A.; Cuesta-Llavona, E.; Rodriguez-Garcia, R.; Boga, J.

172526,Carbon dots for efficient siRNA delivery and gene silencing in plants,2019-08-01,"Background: The cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) associated with COVID-19 pneumonia occurs in up to 20% of the admitted patients causing high morbidity and mortality [1]. In the COVID High-intensity Immunosuppression in Cytokine storm syndrome (CHIC) study [1] we reported that CSS patients, who despite high-dose methylprednisolone (MP) treatment still showed severe respiratory deterioration, received subsequent single dose tocilizumab (TCZ) treatment. Our clinical experience with TCZ, every 4 weeks in RA, where a pre-dose serum concentration of ≥ 1 μg/ml is sufficient to block all interleukin (IL)-6 receptors and thereby induce and maintain clinical remission, prompted further investigation of TCZ pharmacokinetics in patients with COVID-19 CSS [1,2]. Objectives: In this pharmacokinetic study we investigated the clinical-pharmacokinetic rationale for a single TCZ dose in a subset of COVID19 induced CSS patients. Methods: Patients with COVID-19-associated CSS, defined as rapid respiratory deterioration plus at least two biomarker elevations (C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥100 mg/L;ferritin ≥900 μg/L;D-dimers ≥1500 μg/L), received per protocol highdose intravenous MP for 5 consecutive days. If the respiratory condition had not improved sufficiently, TCZ (8 mg/kg, max. 800 mg) single infusion was added on or after day 2[1]. TCZ serum samples were drawn at TCZ day 1, 3 and 10 to assess TCZ serum concentrations with a validated ELISA-method. A nonlinear-mixed effects model was developed based on all concentration time data to characterise TCZ pharmacokinetics (NONMEM). Subsequently individual pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-inf, Cmax, time above 1 μg/ml) were estimated and TCZ concentration-time observations were plotted against the individual predicted concentrations to visualize the complete TCZ concentration-time curve. Results: In total, 34 patients with COVID19 induced CSS still showing clinical deterioration upon MP treatment received TCZ per protocol [mean (SD) age: 62 (12) years, 22% female, baseline mean (SD) bodyweight: 87 (17) kg, CRP: 108 (833) mmol/L, ferritin: 1653 (911) μg/L, D-dimers 4462 (7272) μg/L]. TCZ clearance was described by a homogeneous population-kinetics model yielding 87 serum samples. TCZ serum concentrations followed a biphasic course [Distribution volume 5.0 L (3.3-7.3), Area Under the Curve0-∞1st dose (682 (397-913) mg/L∗days), Cmax 137 mg/L (88 -199), half-life (linear) 3.5 days (2.3-4.1)]. In all patients, TCZ serum concentrations remained above the theoretical maximum IL-6 receptor occupancy concentration of 1 μg/ml for at least 12 days, depicted in Figure 1. Conclusion: Based on our study results on the pharmacokinetics of TCZ in patients with severe COVID-19 induced CSS we conclude that the clearance of TCZ is faster compared to RA-patients at steady state. However, our observations indicate that a single dose of tocilizumab in CSS-patients is enough to cover IL-6 mediated hyperinflammation. Restricting TCZ to a single dosage can prevent overtreatment, drug shortage and saves costs, while still maintaining efficacy, as most patients will have overcome their hyperinflammatory period of the CSS after 10-14 days.","Boone, N.; Ramiro, S.; Moes, D.

The proposal was implemented in a Portuguese secondary school class and combines asynchronous classes (ASC) with synchronous classes (SC). We collected data using quantitative and qualitative methods, to characterise the learning environment, and its influence on the students' engagement. The integrated analysis of the data reveals that the proposal created an adequate learning environment, organised, and supported by a robust social presence of the teacher. The design of the ASC enhanced student-content interactions leading to high rates of commitment to the tasks, which ensured an efficient preparation of the ASC. The SC division into learning episodes allowed us to understand the influence of episode design on the interaction patterns developed. The dynamic and interactive approaches of SC allowed the development of subject contents initiated in ASC. Despite the design of some episodes it has allowed measurable improvements in the number of student-student interactions it has also conditioned the collaborative construction of knowledge based on research processes.","Ribeirinha, T.; da Silva, B.

The scheduling aims at achieving the best utilization of the available working day-time hours, which is calculated as the total consumed disinfection times minus the total loosed transportation times. The proposed problem in network optimization identifies a disinfection group who is likely to select a route to reach a subset of predetermined public places to be regularly disinfected with the most utilization of the available day-working hours. A Nonlinear Binary Model is introduced with a detailed real application case study involving improving the scheduling of Coronavirus disinfection process for some Educational Institutions as an example of crowded public places in Cairo, Egypt. The case study mathematical model is solved using a novel Discrete Binary Gaining-Sharing knowledge-based optimization algorithm (DBGSK).

The contribution of children to viral spread in schools is still under debate. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to investigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the school setting. Methods: Literature searches from April, 2021 and repeated on May, 15th 2021 yielded a total of 1088 publications: screening, contact tracing and seroprevalence studies. MOOSE guidelines were followed and data analyzed using random-effects models. Results: From screening studies involving more than 120,000 subjects, we estimated 0.31% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.05-0.81%) SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence in schools. Contact tracing studies, involving a total of 112,622 contacts of children and adults, showed that onward viral transmission was limited (2.54%; 95%CI 0.76-5.31). Young index cases were found to be 74% significantly less likely than adults to favor viral spread (Odds Ratio [OR]=0.26; 95%CI 0.11-0.63) and were less susceptible to infection (OR=0.60; 95% CI 0.25-1.47). Finally, from seroprevalence studies, with a total of 17,879 subjects involved, we estimated that children are 43% significantly less likely than adults to test positive for antibodies (OR=0.57; 95%CI: 0.49-0.68). In conclusion, testing all subjects in schools, independently of symptoms, students less likely than adults favor viral spread and SARS-CoV-2 circulation in schools was found to be limited.","Martinoli, C.; Vecchia, C.

These consequences are not only humanitarian but also financial and economic. This article raises the question of whether the state of the health system is a factor that determines the direction of changes in consumer and business sentiment during the COVID-19 or whether other factors are more significant. The goal is to find out whether there is real progress in the national health system of a particular country or a regression and on this base to answer the question: What is more important for the expectations of the population and industry during the spread of the pandemic;the dynamics of the development of the health system or other factors? To assess the dynamics of the development of the health care system in different countries, we used the annual data on individual health indicators of the OECD countries for 2006–2019. There were identified countries with dynamic development and a slowing/deteriorating health system. Based on Granger’s approach in EViews, we used the Augmented Dickey–Fuller test and admit that health care systems are not a determining factor in consumer and business sentiment during a pandemic, i.e., only economic factors.

We previously demonstrated in preclinical models and in human clinical trials that our SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein vaccine adjuvanted with AS03 (CoV2 preS dTM-AS03) elicits robust neutralizing antibody responses in naïve subjects. Here, the objective was to document the potency of various booster vaccine formulations in macaques previously vaccinated with mRNA or protein subunit vaccine candidates. We show that one booster dose of AS03-adjuvanted CoV2 preS dTM, D614 (parental) or B.1.351 (Beta), in monovalent or bivalent (D614 + B.1.351) formulations, significantly boosted pre-existing neutralizing antibodies and elicited high and stable cross-neutralizing antibodies covering the four known SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) and, unexpectedly, SARS-CoV-1, in primed macaques. Interestingly, the non-adjuvanted CoV2 preS dTM B.1.351 vaccine formulation also significantly boosted and broadened the neutralizing antibody responses. Our findings show that these vaccine candidates used as a booster have the potential to offer cross-protection against a broad spectrum of variants.

This study was conducted to assess the perception and hesitancy among the physicians of major cities of India toward the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine. Methodology: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between November 25, and December 25, 2020, among the frontline physicians, and they were asked if they would get vaccinated as soon as the vaccine is available in the market. Associations between sociodemographic characteristics and acceptance and hesitancy of an upcoming COVID-19 vaccine were analyzed. Results: Among 139 respondents who gave consent, the majority was male (121, 83.4%). Seventy-six (54.7%) respondents would like to get vaccinated as soon as the vaccine is available. Fifty-six (40.28%) participants had shown fear against the new vaccines, and self-perceived knowledge about the vaccine was found low (79, 56.83%). The majority of the physicians agreed to get vaccinated once reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction positive or recovered in the past. Self-perceived protection of the new COVID-19 vaccine was high (102, 73.4%), and most physicians thought it safe for humans (89, 64%).

By releasing these small molecular weight peptides, the source cells can influence numerous intracellular processes in the target cells, including the secretion of other cytokines downstream. However, there are no readily available bioinformatic resources that can model cytokine - cytokine interactions. In this effort, we built a communication map between major tissues and blood cells that reveals how cytokine-mediated intercellular networks form during homeostatic conditions. We collated the most prevalent cytokines from literature, and assigned the proteins and their corresponding receptors to source tissue and blood cell types based on enriched consensus RNA-Seq data from the Human Protein Atlas database. To assign more confidence to the interactions, we integrated literature information on cell - cytokine interactions from two systems immunology databases, immuneXpresso and ImmunoGlobe. From the collated information, we defined two metanetworks: a cell-cell communication network connected by cytokines; and a cytokine-cytokine interaction network depicting the potential ways in which cytokines can affect the activity of each other. Using expression data from disease states, we then applied this resource to reveal perturbations in cytokine-mediated intercellular signalling in inflammatory and infectious diseases (ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, respectively). For ulcerative colitis, with CytokineLink we demonstrated a significant rewiring of cytokine-mediated intercellular communication between non-inflamed and inflamed colonic tissues. For COVID-19, we were able to identify inactive cell types and cytokine interactions that may be important following SARS-CoV-2 infection when comparing the cytokine response with other viruses capable of initiating a cytokine storm. Such findings have potential to inform the development of novel, cytokine-targeted therapeutic strategies.

However, this has led to large numbers of missed school days. Therefore, we trialled daily testing of contacts as an alternative, to investigate if it would affect transmission in schools. Methods We performed an open-label cluster randomised controlled trial in students and staff from secondary schools and further education colleges in England (ISRCTN18100261). Schools were randomised to self-isolation of COVID-19 contacts for 10 days (control) or to voluntary daily lateral flow device (LFD) testing for school contacts with LFD-negative contacts remaining at school (intervention). Household contacts were excluded from participation. Co-primary outcomes in all students and staff were symptomatic COVID-19, adjusted for community case rates, to estimate within-school transmission (non-inferiority margin: <50% relative increase), and COVID-19-related school absence. Analyses were performed on an intention to treat (ITT) basis using quasi-Poisson regression, also estimating complier average causal effects (CACE). Secondary outcomes included participation rates, PCR results in contacts and performance characteristics of LFDs vs. PCR. Findings Of 99 control and 102 intervention schools, 76 and 86 actively participated (19-April-2021 to 27-June-2021); additional national data allowed most non-participating schools to be included in the co-primary outcomes. 2432/5763 (42.4%) intervention arm contacts participated. There were 657 symptomatic PCR-confirmed infections during 7,782,537 days-at-risk (59.1/100k/week) and 740 during 8,379,749 days-at-risk (61.8/100k/week) in the control and intervention arms respectively (ITT adjusted incidence rate ratio, aIRR=0.96 [95%CI 0.75-1.22;p=0.72]) (CACE-aIRR=0.86 [0.55-1.34]). There were 55,718 COVID-related absences during 3,092,515 person-school-days (1.8%) and 48,609 during 3,305,403 person-school-days (1.5%) in the control and intervention arms (ITT-aIRR=0.80 [95%CI 0.53-1.21;p=0.29]) (CACE-aIRR 0.61 [0.30-1.23]). 14/886(1.6%) control contacts providing an asymptomatic PCR sample tested positive compared to 44/2981(1.5%) intervention contacts (adjusted odds ratio, aOR=0.73 [95%CI 0.33-1.61;p=0.44]). Rates of symptomatic infection in contacts were 44/4665 (0.9%) and 79/5955 (1.3%), respectively (aOR=1.21 [0.82-1.79;p=0.34]). Interpretation Daily contact testing of school-based contacts was non-inferior to self-isolation for control of COVID-19 transmission.

The structure and functions of a class as a basic social group in education is being radically transformed, becoming more and more virtual especially in COVID-19/post-COVID period. In this regard, this study proposes a model that generalizes the existing trends in changing forms of education towards its digitalization, virtualization and mobility to increase the effectiveness of pedagogical practice. The model is based on Pierre Bourdieu's model of a social field, which has proven its effectiveness in pedagogy. The study considers the communicative space of the class as an integral structure aimed at the optimal academic, social and moral development of the participants. Considering a physical and communicational expanse of class as a social field that describes the field of cognitive, social, and psychological interaction between participants in the educational process, the study tries to establish its structure, stages of formation and suggests considering examples of partial successful application of similar models in other studies. The proposed model acts as a generalization, combining models and approaches previously used on the basis of the social field theory.

Over 123,000,000 individuals have been infected with the coronavirus since a worldwide pandemic was declared in March 2020. We conducted this research to confirm the potential of herbal medicine as a treatment for coronavirus. Methods We infected the A549 cell line with beta coronavirus OC43 then treated with 100 μg/mL Hyunggaeyungyo-tang (HGYGT) or distilled water with a control of HGYGT. We measured the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) to confirm the effectiveness of HGYGT upon coronavirus infection. Results We found the effects of HYGYT decrease the expression level of pPKR, peIF2α, IFI6, IFI44, IFI44L, IFI27, IRF7, OASL and ISG15 when administered to cells with coronavirus infection. The expressions of IL-1, TNF-α, COX-2, NF-κB, iNOS and IKK mRNA were also significantly decreased in the HGYGT group than in the control group. Conclusion Through the reduction of the amount of coronavirus RNA, our research indicates that HGYGT has antiviral effects. The reduction of IKK and iNOS mRNA levels indicate that HGYGT reduces coronavirus RNA expression and may inhibits the replication of coronavirus by acting on NF-kB/Rel pathways to protect oxidative injury. In addition, decreases in mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines indicate that the HGYGT may relieve the symptoms of coronavirus infections.","Won, Seo-Young; Seol, In-Chan; Yoo, Ho-Ryong; Kim, Yoon-Sik",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.02.446680,15
182505,Heat efficiently inactivates coronaviruses inside vehicles,2021-09-09,"The coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19) is a public health challenge due to its rapid global spread. Its unprecedented speed and pervasiveness have led many governments to implement a series of countermeasures, such as lock-downs, stopping/restricting travels, and mandating social distancing. To control and prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is essential to understand the latent dynamics of the disease’s evolution and the effectiveness of the intervention policies. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) capture both randomnesses in spatio-temporal dynamics and uncertainty in observations. In this paper, we apply an overall HMM that, based on multiple nations’COVID-19 data including the USA, several European countries, and countries that have strict control policies, explores different types of observations, and we use it to infer the severity state on small geographical states or regions in the USA and Italy as test cases. Further, we aggregate the severity level of each region over a fixed time period to visualize the time evolution and propagation across regions. Such an analysis and visualization provide suggestions for interventions and responses in a calibrated manner. Results from HMM modeling are consistent with what is observed in Italy and the USA and these models can serve as visualization and proactive decision support tools to policymakers.

182817,The major histocompatibility complex: the value of extended haplotypes in the analysis of associated immune diseases and disorders.,1990,"This project seeks to investigate the under addressed issue of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and the impacts these factors can have on human health. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has once again brought to the forefront the importance of maintaining a healthy indoor environment. Specifically, the improvement of indoor air flow has shown to reduce the risk of airborne virus exposure. This is extremely important in the context of hospitals, which contain high concentrations of atrisk individuals. Thus, the need to create a healthy indoor space is critical to improve public health and COVID-19 mitigation efforts. To create knowledge and provide insight on environmental qualities in the hospital setting, the authors have designed and built an interface to deploy in the University of Virginia Hospital Emergency Department (ED). The interface will display room-specific light, noise, temperature, CO2, humidity, VOC, and PM2.5 levels measured by the low-cost Awair Omni sensor. These insights will assist ED clinicians in mitigating disease-spread and improving patient health and satisfaction while reducing caregiver burden. The team addressed the problem through agile development involving localized sensor deployment and analysis, discovery interviews with hospital clinicians and data scientists throughout, and the implementation of a human-design centered Django interface application. Furthermore, a literature survey was conducted to ascertain appropriate thresholds for the different environmental factors. Together, this work demonstrates opportunities to assist and improve patient care with environmental data. © 2021 IEEE.","Rantas, J.; Wang, D.; Jarrard, W.; Sterchi, J.; Wang, A.; Varnosfaderani, M.

A quasi-experimental design has been carried out in a sample of 116 students from Spain, of the third level of Secondary Education. A questionnaire has been used to collect the research data. The results show that there is a high appreciation by students of both educational experiences, although differences in various dimensions are present. Those who have received teaching based on flipped learning show significance in the dimensions teacher-student, autonomy, deepening and classtime. On the other hand, those who have developed the experience with augmented reality show significance in the dimensions of motivation, interrelation with content and students, and resolution. In conclusion, both the application of an emerging methodology based on flipped learning and the use of educational technology with augmented reality contributes positively to the optimization of learning processes in the Mathematics classroom. © 2021 North Caucasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, State Technological University.

183558,[Purification of coronaviruses from contaminated cattle feces].,1979,"While mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are an appealing therapeutic option for a range of clinical applications, their potential to induce clotting when used systemically remains a safety concern, particularly in hypercoagulable conditions, such as in patients with severe COVID-19, trauma, or cancers. Here, we tested a novel ex vivo approach aimed at improving the safety of MSC systemic administration by use of a bioreactor. In this device, MSCs are seeded on the outside of a hollow-fiber filter, sequestering them behind a hemocompatible membrane, while still maintaining cross talk with blood cells and circulating signaling molecules. The potential for these bioreactor MSCs to induce clots in coagulable plasma was compared against “free” MSCs, as a model of systemic administration, which were directly injected into the circuit. Our results showed that physical isolation of the MSCs via a bioreactor extends the time necessary for clot formation to occur when compared to “free” MSCs. Measurement of cell surface data indicates the presence of known clot inducing factors, namely tissue factor and phosphatidylserine. Results also showed that recovering cells and flushing the bioreactor prior to use further prolonged clot formation time. Further, application of this technology in two in vivo models did not require additional heparin to maintain target ACT levels relative to the acellular device. Taken together, the use of hollow fiber filters to house MSCs, if adopted clinically, could offer a novel method to control systemic MSC exposure and prolong clot formation time.","O’Rourke, Brian; Nguyen, Sunny; Tilles, Arno W.; Bynum, James A.; Cap, Andrew P; Parekkadan, Biju; Barcia, Rita N.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.20.391631,15

The objective of this study is to analyze the school inclusion process of students with ASD by reducing discrimination and stigmatization through contact-based education sessions. This can be achieved through school projects. In the present study, discrimination and stigmatization toward children with ASD were analyzed in high school students (N = 141) through Haghighat’s standardized stigmatization questionnaire (SSQ1). In the active group, a student diagnosed with ASD also participated in the awareness activities of the problems faced by the students with ASD and the contact-based education (CBE) sessions carried out in the classroom. The results showed significant differences in reducing discrimination and stigmatization in high school students, both in the control group and especially in the active group. It was observed that the development of CBE (inclusion of the student with ASD in activities) led to the creation of a supportive school community, demonstrating that the activities carried out within the SucCESS Project achieved their purpose. The SSQ1 can be applied to high school students, and together with CBE activities, it can be used in school inclusion projects for children with ASD or mental disabilities.","Nistor, Gheorghița Cristian-Laurențiu Dumitru",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137056,15

In Great Britain (GB), this low demand combined with large renewable output at times, created conditions that were not expected until renewable capacity increases to meet emissions targets in coming years. The GB system experienced periods of very high instantaneous penetration of non-synchronous renewables, compromising system stability due to the lack of inertia in the grid. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the consequences of the lockdown on the GB electricity system is provided, focusing on the ancillary services procured to guarantee stability. Ancillary-services costs increased by {\pounds}200m in the months of May to July 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 (a threefold increase), highlighting the importance of ancillary services in low-carbon systems. Furthermore, a frequency-secured scheduling model is used in the present paper to showcase the future trends that GB is expected to experience, as penetration of renewables increases on the road to net-zero emissions by 2050.

We analyze data from phone-based surveys on disruptions to agricultural production and food security, administered with 1515 smallholder producers in the states of Haryana and Odisha. We find substantial heterogeneity in how the lockdown affected farmers in these two states, which is likely related to existing structural differences in market infrastructure and to differences in state-specific COVID-related policies. In Odisha, where mechanization is limited, farmers spent more on labor to harvest their crops, and distress selling was more prevalent due to the absence of a well-functioning procurement system for their crops. In Haryana, preexisting market infrastructure allowed the state to sustain procurement at stable prices, limiting impacts on smallholder production. As consumers, farmers in Haryana faced more disruptions than those in Odisha, due to reduced availability of foods in the markets, whereas farmers in Odisha benefited from more diverse cropping patterns and increased local supply of foods following transport restrictions.","Ceballos, Francisco; Kannan, Samyuktha; Kramer, Berber",World Dev.,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105069,15

With respect to haematopoietic cells, APN/CD13 has been considered specific for the myeloid lineage, because granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages, but not lymphocytes of peripheral blood, show a surface expression of CD13 antigen. However, we could recently show that cell-cell contact of lymphocytes with endothelial cells, monocytes, and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (SFCs) results in an increase of steady-state APN/CD13 mRNA and a rapid expression of cell-surface protein on the lymphocytes. In this study using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrate that interaction of the T-cell line Jurkat with SFCs results in a higher activity of the APN/CD13 myeloid promoter in T cells. An enhancer located between the myeloid and epithelial APN/CD13 promoter increases the response of the promoter to the cell-cell contact-induced expression of APN/CD13 in lymphocytes. Adhesion of lymphocytes to extracellular matrix did not result in increased promoter activity. The lymphocytic promoter response induced by direct cell-cell contact with SFCs is not affected by mutations of a proximal promoter element (nucleotides -48 to -35), which has a possible functional role in the basal APN/CD13 gene expression in lymphocytes. Upregulated peptidase-promoter activity via cell-cell contact shown in this study for the first time is discussed as a general mechanism in peptidase induction.","Kehlen, A; Olsen, J; Langner, J; Riemann, D",Journal of cellular biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11029758/,15

DESIGN Explorative mixed-methods study. METHOD The municipal public health services of Groningen and Fryslân invited all HCPs aged above 18 years who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 18th and April 3rd 2020 to fill out an online questionnaire (n = 109), on average one month after diagnosis. 18 HCPs participated in telephone interviews. RESULTS Almost all HCPs mentioned fatigue as a long-term symptom, less frequently mentioned were, among other things, feeling physically weak and having a cold. Nearly half of them did not have a fever, two-thirds experienced stress. HCPs with comorbidity had more symptoms. The interviews showed that stress in particular occurred in families with children and because of uncertainty about the duration of infectiousness, with lack of good (after)care. Respondents experienced many negative reactions of people in their environment that felt stigmatizing. The isolation at home was considered bearable. CONCLUSION A COVID-19 infection has a significant impact on physical and mental health, even in HCPs with mild symptoms. Persistent fatigue in particular hinders patients' functioning. The absence of fever in almost half of the respondents is remarkable, as well as the negative impact on psychological well-being. HCPs are also dissatisfied with after-care.

We evaluated two multiplex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) products coupled with microarray-based systems for simultaneous detection of common respiratory tract viral pathogens. The NGEN respiratory virus analyte-specific assay (Nanogen, San Diego, CA) detects influenza A virus (Flu-A) and Flu-B, parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV-1), PIV-2, and PIV-3, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), while the ResPlex II assay (Genaco Biomedical Products, Inc., Huntsville, AL) detects Flu-A, Flu-B, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4, RSV, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinoviruses (RhVs), enteroviruses (EnVs), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV). A total of 360 frozen respiratory specimens collected for a full year were tested, and results were compared to those obtained with a combined reference standard of cell culture and monoplex real-time TaqMan RT-PCR assays. NGEN and ResPlex II gave comparable sensitivities for Flu-A (82.8 to 86.2%), Flu-B (90.0 to 100.0%), PIV-1 (87.5 to 93.8%), PIV-3 (66.7 to 72.2%), and RSV (63.3 to 73.3%); both assays achieved excellent specificities (99.1 to 100.0%) for these five common viruses. The ResPlex II assay detected hMPV in 13 (3.6%) specimens, with a sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 99.7%. The ResPlex II assay also differentiated RSV-A and RSV-B and gave positive results for RhV and EnV in 31 (8.6%) and 19 (5.3%) specimens, respectively. PIV-2, PIV-4, and SARS CoV were not detected in the specimens tested. The two systems can process 80 (NGEN) and 96 (ResPlex II) tests per run, with a hands-on time of approximately 60 min and test turnaround times of 6 h (ResPlex II) and 9 h (NGEN). Multiple-panel testing detected an additional unsuspected 9 (3.4%) PIV-1 and 10 (3.7%) PIV-3 infections. While test sensitivities for RSV and PIV-3 need improvement, both the NGEN and ResPlex II assays provide user-friendly and high-throughput tools for simultaneous detection and identification of a panel of common respiratory viral pathogens in a single test format. The multiplex approach enhances diagnosis through detection of respiratory viral etiologic agents in cases in which the presence of the agent was not suspected and a test was not ordered by the clinicians.","Li, Haijing; McCormac, Melinda A; Estes, R Wray; Sefers, Susan E; Dare, Ryan K; Chappell, James D; Erdman, Dean D; Wright, Peter F; Tang, Yi-Wei",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507510/,15

189188,Dipyridamole is an interferon inducer.,1982,"This work aimed to measure the in vivo quantification errors obtained when ray-based iterative reconstruction is used in micro-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). This was investigated with an extensive phantom-based evaluation and two typical in vivo studies using 99mTc and 111In, measured on a commercially available cadmium zinc telluride (CZT)-based small-animal scanner. Iterative reconstruction was implemented on the GPU using ray tracing, including (1) scatter correction, (2) computed tomography-based attenuation correction, (3) resolution recovery, and (4) edge-preserving smoothing. It was validated using a National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) phantom. The in vivo quantification error was determined for two radiotracers: [99mTc]DMSA in naive mice (n = 10 kidneys) and [111In]octreotide in mice (n = 6) inoculated with a xenograft neuroendocrine tumor (NCI-H727). The measured energy resolution is 5.3% for 140.51 keV (99mTc), 4.8% for 171.30 keV, and 3.3% for 245.39 keV (111In). For 99mTc, an uncorrected quantification error of 28 ± 3% is reduced to 8 ± 3%. For 111In, the error reduces from 26 ± 14% to 6 ± 22%. The in vivo error obtained with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid ([99mTc]DMSA) is reduced from 16.2 ± 2.8% to -0.3 ± 2.1% and from 16.7 ± 10.1% to 2.2 ± 10.6% with [111In]octreotide. Absolute quantitative in vivo SPECT is possible without explicit system matrix measurements. An absolute in vivo quantification error smaller than 5% was achieved and exemplified for both [99mTc]DMSA and [111In]octreotide.","Vandeghinste, Bert; Van Holen, Roel; Vanhove, Christian; De Vos, Filip; Vandenberghe, Stefaan; Staelens, Steven",Molecular imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824961/,15

The role of health information systems is to generate, analyse and disseminate such data. In practice, health information systems rarely function systematically. The products of historical, social and economic forces, they are complex, fragmented and unresponsive to needs. International donors in health are largely responsible for the problem, having prioritized urgent needs for data over longer-term country capacity-building. The result is painfully apparent in the inability of most countries to generate the data needed to monitor progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. Solutions to the problem must be comprehensive; money alone is likely to be insufficient unless accompanied by sustained support to country systems development coupled with greater donor accountability and allocation of responsibilities. The Health Metrics Network, a global collaboration in the making, is intended to help bring such solutions to the countries most in need.","AbouZahr, Carla; Boerma, Ties",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16184276/,15

At the patient's location, a wireless PDA-based monitor is used to acquire continuously the patient's vital signs, including heart rate, three-lead electrocardiography, and SpO2. Through the WLAN, the patient's biosignals can be transmitted in real-time to a remote central management unit, and authorized medical staffs can access the data and the case history of the patient, either by the central management unit or the wireless devices. A prototype of this system has been developed and implemented. The system has been evaluated by technical verification, clinical test, and user survey. The evaluation of performance yields a high degree of satisfaction (mean = 4.64, standard deviation--SD = 0.53 in a five-point Likert scale) of users who used the PDA-based system for intrahospital transport. The results also show that the wireless PDA model is superior to the currently used monitors both in mobility and in usability, and is, therefore, better suited to patient transport.","Lin, Yuan-Hsiang; Jan, I-Chien; Ko, Patrick Chow-In; Chen, Yen-Yu; Wong, Jau-Min; Jan, Gwo-Jen",IEEE transactions on information technology in biomedicine : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615034/,15

In this study, we examined the envelopment of HCMV particles in human lung fibroblasts (HF) HL 411 and HL 19, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells at different time points after infection by electron microscopy (EM), immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy analysis. Double-immunofluorescence labeling experiments demonstrated colocalization of the HCMV glycoprotein B (gB) with the Golgi resident enzyme mannosidase II, the Golgi marker TGN (trans-Golgi network) 46, and the secretory vacuole marker Rab 3 in all cell types investigated. Final envelopment of tegumented capsids was observed at 5 days postinfection by EM, when tegumented capsids budded into subcellular compartments located in the cytoplasm, in close proximity to the Golgi apparatus. Immunogold labeling and EM analysis confirmed staining of the budding compartment with HCMV gB, Rab 3, and mannosidase II in HL 411 cells. However, the markers Rab 1, Rab 2, Rab 7, Lamp 1 (late endosomes and lysosomes), and Lamp 2 (lysosomes) neither showed specific staining of the budding compartment in the immunogold labeling experiments nor colocalized with gB in the immunofluorescent colocalization experiments in any cell type studied. Together, these results suggest that the final envelopment of HCMV particles takes place mainly into a Golgi-derived secretory vacuole destined for the plasma membrane, which may release new infectious virus particles by fusion with the plasma membrane.","Homman-Loudiyi, M; Hultenby, K; Britt, W; Söderberg-Nauclér, C",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12584343/,15
191608,"Canine viral enteritis: prevalence of parvo-, corona- and rotavirus infections in dogs in the Netherlands.",1980,"Catalase (CAT) is a well-studied enzyme that plays an important role in protecting cells against the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide. In human, it has been implicated in different physiological and pathological conditions. This review summarizes the information available on the function and role of CAT polymorphisms in pathogenesis of various pathophysiological states as well as on the regulation of CAT gene expression. Numerous studies have described the CAT polymorphisms and their link with various diseases. Changes in the CAT levels were reported in many different diseases and polymorphisms in the CAT gene were shown to be associated with different pathophysiological states, e.g. hypertension, diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, asthma, bone metabolism or vitiligo. Regulation of the CAT gene expression plays an important role in the levels of CAT. The catalase gene expression is regulated by various mechanisms involving e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), p53 protein and hypermethylation of CpG islands in the catalase promoter. Transcription of the CAT gene is mainly influenced by the -262 C/T and -844 A/G polymorphisms. A common polymorphism -262 C/T in the promoter region has been found to be associated with altered CAT activities. Apart from genetic factors, the activities of CAT may be affected by age, seasonal variations, physical activity, or a number of chemical compounds. Future investigations are necessary to elucidate the role of CAT in pathogenesis of oxidative stress-related diseases.","Kodydková, J; Vávrová, L; Kocík, M; Žák, A",Folia biologica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25152049/,15

Endocrine dysfunctions predispose to numerous pulmonary disorders, including various respiratory infections. On the other hand, pulmonary conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obstructive sleep apnoea can produce critical metabolic and endocrine derangements. Varied manifestations such as primary adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis and hypercalcaemia can result from chronic granulomatous conditions like tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. Various endocrine consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 are also getting apparent during the pandemic. Tumours of the lung can secrete different hormones that give rise to several endocrine paraneoplastic syndromes.

The facts that scFv H12 bound to the SARS-S1 protein under non-reducing conditions and that it did not bind to monomeric S1 protein under reducing conditions strongly suggest that scFv H12 recognizes a conformational epitope shared by oligomeric S1 proteins. This study should aid in the manufacture of neutralizing antibody, provide a better understanding the immunological characteristics of SARS protein and facilitate the design of a SARS vaccine.","Duan, Jinzhu; Ji, Xin; Feng, Jing; Han, Wei; Zhang, Panhe; Cao, Wuchun; Guo, Xueming; Qi, Cai; Yang, Dongling; Jin, Gang; Gao, Guangxia; Yan, Xiyun",Antiviral therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16518967/,15

In addition, umbilical eversion and umbilical herniation occasionally develop. Therefore, mini-laparoscopic surgery using 3-mm trocars can be recommended for patients who do not want the natural appearance of the navel to be altered.

DESIGN Cross-sectional study comparing body temperatures measured by remote-sensing infrared thermography (maximum for frontal, forehead, or lateral views) with core temperatures measured by aural or oral methods. SETTING Accident and Emergency Department, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS A total of 1517 patients (747 men, 770 women) with or without fever; 34 of whom entered a substudy to measure the effects of distance on recorded temperature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The proportions of subjects with fever (core temperature of 38°C or above) detected by remote-sensing infrared thermography compared with the proportion detected by conventional thermometry. RESULTS The correlations between infrared thermography temperatures and core temperature were only moderate (r=0.36-0.44), albeit statistically significant. The temperature recorded by infrared thermography was inversely proportional to the distance from the camera. There were 113 (7.4%) subjects with a core temperature of 38°C or above. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the three infrared thermography measurements were around 0.8. However, the maximum sensitivity achieved at a low cut-off temperature of 35°C was only 0.87 (for frontal and lateral infrared thermography views), resulting in 13% of febrile subjects being missed. The maximum forehead temperature in general had the poorest performance among the three infrared thermography views. CONCLUSIONS Forehead infrared thermography readings from a distance should be abandoned for fever screening. Although maximum lateral or frontal infrared thermography temperatures have reasonable correlations with core temperatures and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves, the sensitivity-specificity combination might still not be high enough for screening febrile conditions, especially at border crossings with huge numbers of passengers.","Chan, L S; Lo, Jessica L F; Kumana, Cyrus R; Cheung, Bernard M Y",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23535669/,15
193323,Novel antiviral agents: a medicinal plant perspective.,2003,"Norwalk virus (NV) is a causative agent of acute epidemic nonbacterial gastroenteritis in humans. The inability to cultivate NV has required the use of molecular techniques to examine the genome organization and functions of the viral proteins. The function of the NV protein encoded by open reading frame 3 (ORF 3) has been unknown. In this paper, we report the characterization of the NV ORF 3 protein expressed in a cell-free translation system and in insect cells and show its association with recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) and NV virions. Expression of the ORF 3 coding region in rabbit reticulocyte lysates resulted in the production of a single protein with an apparent molecular weight of 23,000 (23K protein), which is not modified by N-linked glycosylation. The ORF 3 protein was expressed in insect cells by using two different baculovirus recombinants; one recombinant contained the entire 3' end of the genome beginning with the ORF 2 coding sequences (ORFs 2+3), and the second recombinant contained ORF 3 alone. Expression from the construct containing both ORF 2 and ORF 3 resulted in the expression of a single protein (23K protein) detected by Western blot analysis with ORF 3-specific peptide antisera. However, expression from a construct containing only the ORF 3 coding sequences resulted in the production of multiple forms of the ORF 3 protein ranging in size from 23,000 to 35,000. Indirect-immunofluorescence studies using an ORF 3 peptide antiserum showed that the ORF 3 protein is localized to the cytoplasm of infected insect cells. The 23K ORF 3 protein was consistently associated with recombinant VLPs purified from the media of insect cells infected with a baculovirus recombinant containing the entire 3' end of the NV genome. Western blot analysis of NV purified from the stools of NV-infected volunteers revealed the presence of a 35K protein as well as multiple higher-molecular-weight bands specifically recognized by an ORF 3 peptide antiserum. These results indicate that the ORF 3 protein is a minor structural protein of the virion.","Glass, P J; White, L J; Ball, J M; Leparc-Goffart, I; Hardy, M E; Estes, M K",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10864672/,15

These recommendations are aimed at all breeders and users of laboratory mice, rats, Syrian hamsters, guinea pigs and rabbits as well as diagnostic laboratories. They describe essential aspects of HM, such as the choice of agents, selection of animals and tissues for testing, frequency of sampling, commonly used test methods, interpretation of results and HM reporting. Compared with previous recommendations, more emphasis is put on the role of a person with sufficient understanding of the principles of HM, opportunistic agents, the use of sentinel animals (particularly under conditions of cage-level containment) and the interpretation and reporting of HM results. Relevant agents, testing frequencies and literature references are updated.

193552,Astonishing diversity of natural surfactants: 5. Biologically active glycosides of aromatic metabolites.,2005,"The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) membrane (M) protein contains only O-linked oligosaccharides. We have used this protein as a model to study the structural requirements for O-glycosylation. We show that MHV M is modified by the addition of a single oligosaccharide side chain at the cluster of 4 hydroxylamino acids present at its extreme amino terminus and identified Thr at position 5 as the functional acceptor site. The hydroxylamino acid cluster, which is quite conserved among O-glycosylated coronavirus M proteins, is not in itself sufficient for O-glycosylation. Downstream amino acids are required to introduce a functional O-glycosylation site into a foreign protein. In a mutagenic analysis O-glycosylation was found to be sensitive to some particular changes but no unique sequence motif for O-glycosylation could be identified. Expression of mutant M proteins in cells revealed that substitution of any 1 residue was tolerated, conceivably due to the occurrence of multiple UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc transferases). Indeed, MHV M served as a substrate for GalNac-T1, -T2, and -T3, as was demonstrated using an in situ glycosylation assay based on the co-expression of endoplasmic reticulum-retained forms of the GalNAc transferases with endoplasmic reticulum-resident MHV M mutants. The GalNAc transferases were found to have largely overlapping, but distinct substrate specificities. The requirement for a threonine as acceptor rather than a serine residue and the requirement for a proline residue three positions downstream of the acceptor site were found to be distinctive features.","de Haan, C A; Roestenberg, P; de Wit, M; de Vries, A A; Nilsson, T; Vennema, H; Rottier, P J",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9792708/,15

Ty1 integrase has a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at its C terminus. Both full-length integrase and a C-terminal fragment localize to the nucleus. C-terminal deletion mutants in Ty1 integrase were used to map the putative NLS to the last 74 amino acid residues of integrase. Mutations in basic segments within this region decreased retrotransposition at least 50-fold in vivo. Furthermore, these mutant integrase proteins failed to localize to the nucleus. Production of virus-like particles, reverse transcriptase activity, and complete in vitro Ty1 integration resembled wild-type levels, consistent with failure of the mutant integrases to enter the nucleus.","Kenna, M A; Brachmann, C B; Devine, S E; Boeke, J D",Molecular and cellular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9448009/,15

In this study, we investigated the effect of MxA expression on the replication of West Nile Virus strain Kunjin (WNV(KUN)). Pretreatment of A549 cells with IFN-alpha lead to increased expression of MxA, which contributed to inhibition of WNV(KUN) replication and secretion. However, in Vero cells stably expressing the MxA protein, WNV(KUN) replication, maturation and secretion was not inhibited. Biochemical and subcellular localization studies of WNV(KUN) proteins and MxA suggest that the MxA activity was not compromised by a flavivirus-encoded antagonist. Instead, we show that characteristic membranous structures induced during WNV(KUN) replication provide partial protection from MxA, possibly by 'hiding' WNV(KUN) replication components. This distinct compartmentalization of viral replication and components of the cellular antiviral response may be an evolutionary mechanism by which flaviviruses can hide from host surveillance.","Hoenen, Antje; Liu, Wenjun; Kochs, Georg; Khromykh, Alexander A; Mackenzie, Jason M",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17947524/,15

COVID-19 outbreak spread across the world within a few months of initiation from Wuhan City of China and affected all the countries across the globe except Antarctica. From the psychopathological view, this current COVID -19 is a stressor, trauma or stigma for health care workers as well as general population. Mental health and psychosocial consequences of COVID 19 has a serious impact on various categories of people : a) those directly involved with viral overload b) health care workers c) general population who are following social media d) quarantined individuals and their family members. The aim of our study was to determine the unforeseen psychosocial impact of COVID 19 pandemic on mental status of health care workers and general population. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross sectional online survey using an anonymous questionnaire using snowball sampling strategy was done. The study included 480 respondents, out of which 197 were health care workers and 283 were general population. The participation was totally voluntary. Data collection took place over fifteen days .We included additional questions which were related to COVID-19 outbreak. The structured questionnaire used, consisted of questions that covered several areas. Anxiety level was assessed based on Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale ranging from 0-4 , consisted of 14 items. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION According to Hamilton anxiety rating scale it was seen that out of 197 health care workers, 27% had mild anxiety (<17), 18.7% had mild to moderate (18-24), 17.7% had moderate to severe (25-30), and 35.5% had very severe(>31).

196118,Pathogenesis of avian flu H5N1 and SARS.,2006,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) replication in actively growing DBT and 17Cl-1 cells resulted in the inhibition of host cellular DNA synthesis and the accumulation of infected cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle. UV-irradiated MHV failed to inhibit host cellular DNA synthesis. MHV infection in quiescent 17Cl-1 cells that had been synchronized in the G(0) phase by serum deprivation prevented infected cells from entering the S phase after serum stimulation. MHV replication inhibited hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), the event that is necessary for cell cycle progression through late G(1) and into the S phase. While the amounts of the cellular cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1), and p16(INK4a) did not change in infected cells, MHV infection in asynchronous cultures induced a clear reduction in the amounts of Cdk4 and G(1) cyclins (cyclins D1, D2, D3, and E) in both DBT and 17Cl-1 cells and a reduction in Cdk6 levels in 17Cl-1 cells. Infection also resulted in a decrease in Cdk2 activity in both cell lines. MHV infection in quiescent 17Cl-1 cells prevented normal increases in Cdk4, Cdk6, cyclin D1, and cyclin D3 levels after serum stimulation. The amounts of cyclin D2 and cyclin E were not increased significantly after serum stimulation in mock-infected cells, whereas they were decreased in MHV-infected cells, suggesting the possibility that MHV infection may induce cyclin D2 and cyclin E degradation. Our data suggested that a reduction in the amounts of G(1) cyclin-Cdk complexes in MHV-infected cells led to a reduction in Cdk activities and insufficient hyperphosphorylation of pRb, resulting in inhibition of the cell cycle in the G(0)/G(1) phase.","Chen, Chun-Jen; Makino, Shinji",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15140963/,15

Some properties of strains 229E and OC43.,1972,"Structure-based drug design (SBDD) has emerged as a valuable pharmaceutical lead discovery tool, showing potential for accelerating the discovery process,while reducing developmental costs and boosting potencies of the drug that is ultimately selected. SBDD is an iterative, rational, lead compound sculpting process that involves both the synthesis of new derivatives and the evaluation of their binding to the target structure either through computational docking or elucidation of the target structure as a complex with the lead compound. This method heavily relies on the production of high resolution(< 2 Å) 3D structures of the drug target, obtained through X-ray crystallographic analysis, in the presence or absence of the drug candidate.The lack of generalized methods for high quality crystal production is still a major bottleneck in the process of macromolecular crystallization. This review provides a brief introduction to SBDD and describes several macromolecular crystallization strategies, with an emphasis on advances and challenges facing researchers in the field today. Recent trends in the development of more universal macromolecular crystallization techniques, particularly nucleation-based techniques that are applicable to both soluble and integral membrane proteins, are also discussed.","Grey, Jessica Lynn; Thompson, David H",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21116481/,15

Inflammatory and thrombosis are its main manifestations. As an important organ of hemofiltration metabolism, the kidney is prone to blockage and destruction when filter high inflammatory and high viscous blood of COVID-19, resulting in the loss of a large amount of protein, aggravating blood concentration, and then worsening COVID-19 hypercoagulability, which may explain the phenomenon of erythrocytes aggregation blocking the capillary lumen and the main reason why the kidney has become the second largest involvement organs. Therefore, this review discusses the effects of pathophysiological mechanisms such as inflammatory storm, endothelial injury, phosphatidylserine expression, extracellular traps release on renal capillary thrombosis caused by COVID-19 infection. Meanwhile, in view of the above mechanisms, we put forward the potential targets of antithrombotic therapy, and graded management of patients, reasonable use of drugs according to the severity of the disease and the choice of time. And we support the view of prevention of thrombus before admission, continuous anticoagulation and drug choice after discharge. It is suggested that the symptomatic and supportive treatment of renal disease in critically ill patients should be combined with the concept of antithrombotic therapy. The ultimate goal is to reduce the occurrence and development of kidney disease, provide direction for the current management of COVID-19 with kidney disease, and reduce the mortality of COVID-19.","Chen, Xiaojing; Yu, Chengyuan; Jing, Haijiao; Wang, Chunxu; Zhao, Xinyi; Zhang, Jinming; Zhang, Shuoqi; Liu, Huan; Xie, Rujuan; Shi, Jialan",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437350/,15

This cleavage occurs intramolecularly between the C terminus of the L proteinases and the N terminus of the subsequent protein VP4. The foot-and-mouth disease virus enzyme has been shown, in addition, to cleave at least one cellular protein, the eukaryotic initiation factor 4G. Mechanistically, inhibitor studies and sequence analysis have been used to classify the L proteinases as papain-like cysteine proteinases. However, sequence identity within the L proteinases themselves is low (between 18% and 32%) and only 14% between the L proteinases and papain. Secondary structure predictions, sequence alignments that take into account the positions of the essential catalytic residues, and structural considerations have been used in this study to investigate more closely the relationships between the L proteinases and papain. In spite of the low sequence identities, the analyses strongly suggest that the L proteinases of foot-and-mouth disease virus and of equine rhinovirus 1 have a similar overall fold to that of papain. Regions in the L proteinases corresponding to all five alpha-helices and seven beta-sheets of papain could be identified. Further comparisons with the proteinase bleomycin hydrolase, which also displays a papain topology in spite of important differences in size and amino acid sequence, support these conclusions and suggest how a C-terminal extension, present in all three L proteinases, and predicted to be an alpha-helix, might enable C-terminal self-processing to occur.","Skern, T; Fita, I; Guarné, A",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9472614/,15

To explore the genomic signatures, we comprehensively analyzed 2,492 complete and/or near-complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains reported from across the globe to the GISAID database up to 30 March 2020. Genome-wide annotations revealed 1,516 nucleotide-level variations at different positions throughout the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, nucleotide (nt) deletion analysis found twelve deletion sites throughout the genome other than previously reported deletions at coding sequence of the ORF8 (open reading frame), spike, and ORF7a proteins, specifically in polyprotein ORF1ab (n = 9), ORF10 (n = 1), and 3´-UTR (n = 2). Evidence from the systematic gene-level mutational and protein profile analyses revealed a large number of amino acid (aa) substitutions (n = 744), demonstrating the viral proteins heterogeneous. Notably, residues of receptor-binding domain (RBD) showing crucial interactions with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and cross-reacting neutralizing antibody were found to be conserved among the analyzed virus strains, except for replacement of lysine with arginine at 378th position of the cryptic epitope of a Shanghai isolate, hCoV-19/Shanghai/SH0007/2020 (EPI_ISL_416320). Furthermore, our results of the preliminary epidemiological data on SARS-CoV-2 infections revealed that frequency of aa mutations were relatively higher in the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of Europe (43.07%) followed by Asia (38.09%), and North America (29.64%) while case fatality rates remained higher in the European temperate countries, such as Italy, Spain, Netherlands, France, England and Belgium.

This study aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on routine vaccinations by country, antigen, and sector (public or private), up to 1 June 2020, and to identify the reasons for disruption and possible solutions. Methods: Sanofi Pasteur teams from 19 countries in SEAR/WPR completed a structured questionnaire reporting on COVID-19 disruptions for 13-19 routinely delivered antigens per country, based on sales data, government reports, and regular physician interactions. Data were analysed descriptively, disruption causes ranked, and solutions evaluated using a modified public health best practices framework. Findings: 95% (18/19) of countries reported vaccination disruption. When stratified by country, a median of 91% (interquartile range 77-94) of antigens were impacted. Infancy and school-entry age vaccinations were most impacted. Both public and private sector healthcare providers experienced disruptions. Vaccination rates had not recovered for 39% of impacted antigens by 1 June 2020. Fear of infection, movement/travel restrictions, and limited healthcare access were the highest-ranked reasons for disruption. Highest-scoring solutions were separating vaccination groups from unwell patients, non-traditional vaccination venues, virtual engagement, and social media campaigns. Many of these solutions were under-utilised. Interpretation: COVID-19-induced disruption of routine vaccination was more widespread than previously reported. Adaptable solutions were identified which could be implemented in SEAR/WPR and elsewhere.

METHODS: The present was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted at the Tokyo Metropolitan Hospital from March to September, 2020. Patients who received a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 were included and categorized into the PHC referral or direct walk-in groups. The outcomes included the total number of patients undergoing PCR tests and the percentage of PCR positivity in each group. RESULTS: We identified 1680 patients (781 PHC referred and 899 direct walk-in groups). The percentage of PCR positivity did not significantly differ between the PHC referral and direct walk-in groups during the first wave (30.5% vs. 29.2%; p = 0.78).

METHOD: Using data published by NHS digital and NHS England on previous years, we have analysed and used this to produce estimates of cancellations and missed cases. We also analyse government data on waiting lists and show compliance or lack of with these. RESULTS: We show that compliance with waiting list times pre pandemic was falling year on year (83.2% in 2020 down from 87% in 2019). Every month that passes we estimate that 400 000 cases are not being performed. This may include urgent cancer care work in some trusts. CONCLUSIONS: Waiting lists have been governed by strict rules since 2004. Given falling compliance with 18-week intention to treat we believe the scale of the backlog combined with NHS capacity diminished due to Covid-19 precautions is a public health crisis waiting to occur. We identify difficulties in resuming elective work and suggest strategies that could be employed to avoid a public health crisis.","Macdonald, Nathanael; Clements, Caterina; Sobti, Anshul; Rossiter, Daniel; Unnithan, Ashwin; Bosanquet, Nicholas",J Public Health (Oxf),,15

METHODS: Cross sectional anonymous survey of pregnant women undergoing genetic counseling at a tertiary care referral center. Subjects' perceived risk of procedure related loss and fetal chromosomal problem were obtained via survey where patients rated risk from 0 (no risk) to 10 (highest risk). RESULTS: There were no differences in sociodemographic factors between women undergoing a diagnostic procedure compared to those not undergoing a procedure. As the perceived risk for having a baby with genetic problem increased by one point, the estimated odds of having the diagnostic procedure increased by 43% controlling for the perceived risk of procedure related loss (p < .0001). Similarly, as the perceived risk of miscarriage increased by one point, the odds of having the diagnostic procedure decreased by 40%, controlling for the perceived risk of having a baby with a genetic problem (p < .0001). The main reason women cited for not undergoing a procedure was fear of procedure related loss. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women that decline diagnostic testing have a higher perceived risk of procedure related loss and lower perceived risk of fetal chromosomal abnormality than those who accept.","Igel, Catherine M; Rabin-Havt, Sara; Estrada Trejo, Fatima; Doulaveris, Georgios; Eisenberg, Ruth; Fazzari, Melissa; Klugman, Susan",Prenat. diagn,,15

Hypocalcemia is a common laboratory finding in critically ill patients. Data regarding levels of calcium in SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with hypocalcemia could have a worse outcome. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and included all patients who had any serum calcium measurement in the first 72 hours since hospital admission. Main objective was to investigate the relation of low serum calcium with adverse outcome, measured by the requirement of high oxygen support - defined as high flow nasal cannula oxygen, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and/or invasive ventilation-, intensive care unit admission or death. RESULTS: A total of 316 patients were included in the study. Median age was 65 years (IQR 55-74), 65% were men. Hypocalcemia within 72 hours since hospital admission was present in 63% of patients. A higher number of patients in the hypocalcemia group required high oxygen support during hospitalization (49% vs 32%; p = 0,01) and were admitted to the ICU (42% vs 26%; p = 0,005). No differences in mortality were observed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Hypocalcemia is frequent in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and can identify patients with worse outcome. More studies are needed to understand the role of calcium metabolism in SARS-CoV-2 infection and to address the clinical implications and therapeutic interventions it might have.","Torres, Berta; Alcubilla, Pau; González-Cordón, Ana; Inciarte, Alexy; Chumbita, Mariana; Cardozo, Celia; Meira, Fernanda; Giménez, Marga; de Hollanda, Ana; Soriano, Alex",Int. j. infect. dis,,15

There are no data about parents' SM practices for their children's dental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aims to evaluate parents' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding self-medication for their children's dental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Turkey. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in the pediatric dental clinic at Ondokuz Mayis University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Pediatric Dentistry, immediately after the COVID-19 lockdown ended. A total of 389 parents who agreed to participate in the study completed the questionnaire from July 1 to October 1. A questionnaire with 18 items was designed to collect information on the parents' knowledge and attitudes regarding when, why, and how to use drugs and on their practices on medicating their children. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics (chi-square test). RESULTS: The majority of parents (n = 273; 70.2%) practiced self-medication for their children's dental problems. Self-medication with a previously prescribed medications was usually preferred by parents (n = 179; 62.2%). Analgesics (98%) were the most commonly used medicines by parents in their self-medication for their children's dental problems. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of self-medication practices for children's dental problems is high in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, new healthcare services, such as teledentistry, may be useful to overcome problems related to the self-medication of children during times when the ability to reach healthcare providers is limited, such as during pandemics.","Sen Tunc, Emine; Aksoy, Emre; Arslan, Hatice Nilden; Kaya, Zeynep",BMC Oral Health,,15

There have been extensive studies investigating the mental health of people in different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have explored the impact of COVID-19 and its association with HRQoL. To fill this research gap and provide further empirical evidence, this study examined the impact of COVID-19 on Hong Kong people and evaluated its association with HRQoL. A total of 500 participants were randomly recruited to complete an online questionnaire on their concerns related to COVID-19. This entailed responding to the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF instrument. Data were collected between 24 April and 3 May 2020. Independent t-tests and multiple linear regressions were used to examine the association between the impact of COVID-19 and HRQoL. Overall, 69.6% of participants were worried about contracting COVID-19, and 41.4% frequently suspected themselves of being infected. Furthermore, 29.0% were concerned by the lack of disinfectants. All of these findings were associated with poorer HRQoL in the physical and psychological health, social relationships, and environment domains. On the other hand, 47.4% of participants were concerned that they may lose their job because of the pandemic, while 39.4% were bothered by the insufficient supply of surgical masks. These two factors were associated with poorer HRQoL in the physical and psychological health and environment domains. The adverse impact of COVID-19 on individuals is multifactorial, affecting all aspects of HRQoL. In addition to enhancing anti-epidemic efforts, it is equally important to implement public health and social welfare measures, thereby diminishing the adverse impact of COVID-19 on overall well-being.","Choi, Edmond Pui Hang; Hui, Bryant Pui Hung; Wan, Eric Yuk Fai; Kwok, Jojo Yan Yan; Tam, Tiffany Hei Lam; Wu, Chanchan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,15

This has been a major issue for developing ML models for the coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic where data is highly imbalanced, particularly within electronic health records (EHR) research. Conventional approaches in ML use cross-entropy loss (CEL) that often suffers from poor margin classification. For the first time, we show that contrastive loss (CL) improves the performance of CEL especially for imbalanced EHR data and the related COVID-19 analyses. This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. We use EHR data from five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) to predict mortality, intubation, and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer in hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 24 and 48 hour time windows. We train two sequential architectures (RNN and RETAIN) using two loss functions (CEL and CL). Models are tested on full sample data set which contain all available data and restricted data set to emulate higher class imbalance.CL models consistently outperform CEL models with the restricted data set on these tasks with differences ranging from 0.04 to 0.15 for AUPRC and 0.05 to 0.1 for AUROC. For the restricted sample, only the CL model maintains proper clustering and is able to identify important features, such as pulse oximetry. CL outperforms CEL in instances of severe class imbalance, on three EHR outcomes with respect to three performance metrics: predictive power, clustering, and feature importance. We believe that the developed CL framework can be expanded and used for EHR ML work in general.","Wanyan, Tingyi; Honarvar, Hossein; Jaladanki, Suraj K.; Zang, Chengxi; Naik, Nidhi; Somani, Sulaiman; Freitas, Jessica K.

Diabetes (mostly type 2 diabetes mellitus, T2DM) and hyperglycemia are among the major comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 leading to poor outcomes. Reports show that patients with diabetes and COVID-19 are at an increased risk for developing severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death. Here we explore potential mechanistic links that could explain the observed higher morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Patients with T2DM have an underlying increased level of inflammation associated with obesity and insulin resistance in addition to other comorbidities including hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, and being older. We review evidence that T2DM with hyperglycemia are among factors that lead to elevated expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in lungs and other tissues; ACE2 is the cellular ""receptor"" and port of viral entry. The preexisting chronic inflammation with augmented inflammatory response to the infection and the increasing viral load leads to extreme systemic immune response (""cytokine storm"") that is strongly associated with increased severity of COVID-19. Based on the available evidence, it is recommended by a panel of experts that safe but stringent control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipids be carried out in patients with T2DM, measures that could potentially serve to decrease the severity of COVID-19 should these patients contract the viral infection. Once the infection occurs, then attention should be directed to proper glycemic control with use of insulin and frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels.","Rajpal, Aman; Rahimi, Leili; Ismail-Beigi, Faramarz",J. diabetes (Online),,15

The objective was to study the prevalence, demographic, clinical presentations among HCWs with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to compare the viral clearance in HCWs with COVID-19 and co-infection of malaria and dengue. This retrospective study was conducted at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital, BYL Nair Charitable Hospital (NH), Mumbai, India April 6th-October 31st 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs was confirmed by reverse transcription-plymerase chain reaction. Out of 491 HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2, analysis of viral clearance was carried out in 467 HCWs over seven month periods, The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs was 13% (491 out of 3711). Out of the HCWs with COVID-19, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher among security guards (25%) with 1% mortality. The co-infection of malaria or dengue was reported in 31 HCWs (6.3%). The mean duration of virus clearance was longer (12 days) in symptomatic HCWs as compared to asymptomatic (8 days, p < .005). The recovery of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs was faster (mean 8 days) with co-infection of malaria than without malaria (p < .005).

We model communication of misinformation based on a negative trust relation, supported by findings in the literature that relate the endorsement of conspiracy theories with low trust level towards institutions. We provide an agent-based simulation and consider the effects of a misinfodemic on policies related to lockdown strategies, isolation, protection and distancing measures, and overall negative impact on society during a pandemic.

Here we analyze viral genome sequences using a phylodynamic model with geographic structure to estimate the origin and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe prior to border closures. Based on SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reconstruct a partial transmission tree of the early pandemic and coinfer the geographic location of ancestral lineages as well as the number of migration events into and between European regions. We find that the predominant lineage spreading in Europe during this time has a most recent common ancestor in Italy and was probably seeded by a transmission event in either Hubei, China or Germany. We do not find evidence for preferential migration paths from Hubei into different European regions or from each European region to the others. Sustained local transmission is first evident in Italy and then shortly thereafter in the other European regions considered. Before the first border closures in Europe, we estimate that the rate of occurrence of new cases from within-country transmission was within the bounds of the estimated rate of new cases from migration. In summary, our analysis offers a view on the early state of the epidemic in Europe and on migration patterns of the virus before border closures. This information will enable further study of the necessity and timeliness of border closures.","Nadeau, Sarah A; Vaughan, Timothy G; Scire, Jérémie; Huisman, Jana S; Stadler, Tanja",Proc. Natl.

Recently, cytokine storm by the host immune system has been linked with high viral load, loss of lung function, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and subsequent fatal outcome. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify potential FDA approved drugs that can be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment using an in-silico analysis. METHODS: In this study, virtual screening of selected FDA approved drugs was performed by targeting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 and the key molecules involved in the 'Cytokine storm' in COVID-19 patients. Based on our preliminary screening supported by extensive literature search, we selected FDA approved drugs to target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and the key players of cytokine storm, TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-1ß. These compounds were examined based on systematic docking studies and further validated using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanic/generalized/Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/G/P/BSA) free energy calculations. RESULTS: Based on the findings, Rifampicin and Letermovir appeared as the most promising drug showing a very good binding affinity with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-1ß. However, it is pertinent to mention here that our findings need further validation by in vitro analysis and clinical trials. CONCLUSION: This study provides an insight into the drug repurposing approach in which several FDA approved drugs were examined to inhibit COVID-19 infection by targeting the main protease of SARS-COV-2 and the cytokine storm.","Pathak, Yamini; Mishra, Amaresh; Choudhir, Gourav; Kumar, Anuj; Tripathi, Vishwas",Pharmacol. rep,,15

Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 spread swiftly around world and infected more than 25 million people and caused more than 800,000 deaths in 188 countries. Chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD appear to be a risk factor for COVID-19; however, their prevalence remains controversial. In fact, studies in China reported lower rates of chronic respiratory conditions in patients with COVID-19 than in the general population, while the trend is reversed in the United States and Europe. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms of a possible interaction between COVID-19 and chronic respiratory diseases remain unknown, some observations can help to resolve them. Indeed, physiological changes, immune response, or medication used against SARS-CoV-2 may have greater impact on patients with chronic respiratory conditions, already debilitated by chronic inflammation, dyspnea, and the use of immunosuppressant drugs like corticosteroids. In this review, we discuss the importance and the impact of COVID-19 on asthmatics and COPD patients, the possible available treatments, and patient management during the pandemic.","Bouazza, Belaid; Hadj-Said, Dihia; Pescatore, Karen A; Chahed, Rachid",,,15

We aimed to investigate the association between tocilizumab exposure and hospital-related mortality among patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) support for COVID-19. Methods: We did a retrospective observational cohort study at 13 hospitals within the Hackensack Meridian Health network (NJ, USA). We included patients (aged &#8805;18 years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who needed support in the ICU. We obtained data from a prospective observational database and compared outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab with those who did not. We applied a multivariable Cox model with propensity score matching to reduce confounding effects. The primary endpoint was hospital-related mortality. The prospective observational database is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04347993. Findings: Between March 1 and April 22, 2020, 764 patients with COVID-19 required support in the ICU, of whom 210 (27%) received tocilizumab. Factors associated with receiving tocilizumab were patients' age, gender, renal function, and treatment location. 630 patients were included in the propensity score-matched population, of whom 210 received tocilizumab and 420 did not receive tocilizumab. 358 (57%) of 630 patients died, 102 (49%) who received tocilizumab and 256 (61%) who did not receive tocilizumab. Overall median survival from time of admission was not reached (95% CI 23 days-not reached) among patients receiving tocilizumab and was 19 days (16-26) for those who did not receive tocilizumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·56-0·89; p=0·0027). In the primary multivariable Cox regression analysis with propensity matching, an association was noted between receiving tocilizumab and decreased hospital-related mortality (HR 0·64, 95% CI 0·47-0·87; p=0·0040). Similar associations with tocilizumab were noted among subgroups requiring mechanical ventilatory support and with baseline C-reactive protein of 15 mg/dL or higher.

Till now there is no report of any clinically approved antiviral drugs or vaccines that are effective against COVID-19. It has rapidly spread around the world, posing enormous health, economic, environmental and social challenges to the entire human population. The coronavirus outbreak is severely disrupting the global economy. Almost all the nations are struggling to slow down the transmission of the disease by testing & treating patients, quarantining suspected persons through contact tracing, restricting large gatherings, maintaining complete or partial lock down etc. This paper describes the impact of COVID-19 on society and global environment, and the possible ways in which the disease can be controlled has also been discussed therein.","Chakraborty, Indranil; Maity, Prasenjit",Sci Total Environ,,15

242333,Identification of chemosensory genes from the antennal transcriptome of Semiothisa cinerearia,2020,"Background: Severe COVID-19 has a high mortality rate. Comprehensive pathological descriptions of COVID-19 are scarce and limited in scope. We aimed to describe the histopathological findings and viral tropism in patients who died of severe COVID-19. Methods: In this case series, patients were considered eligible if they were older than 18 years, with premortem diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and COVID-19 listed clinically as the direct cause of death. Between March 1 and April 30, 2020, full post-mortem examinations were done on nine patients with confirmed COVID-19, including sampling of all major organs. A limited autopsy was done on one additional patient. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were done, and histopathological findings were reported by subspecialist pathologists. Viral quantitative RT-PCR analysis was done on tissue samples from a subset of patients. Findings: The median age at death of our cohort of ten patients was 73 years (IQR 52-79). Thrombotic features were observed in at least one major organ in all full autopsies, predominantly in the lung (eight [89%] of nine patients), heart (five [56%]), and kidney (four [44%]). Diffuse alveolar damage was the most consistent lung finding (all ten patients); however, organisation was noted in patients with a longer clinical course. We documented lymphocyte depletion (particularly CD8-positive T cells) in haematological organs and haemophagocytosis. Evidence of acute tubular injury was noted in all nine patients examined. Major unexpected findings were acute pancreatitis (two [22%] of nine patients), adrenal micro-infarction (three [33%]), pericarditis (two [22%]), disseminated mucormycosis (one [10%] of ten patients), aortic dissection (one [11%] of nine patients), and marantic endocarditis (one [11%]). Viral genomes were detected outside of the respiratory tract in four of five patients. The presence of subgenomic viral RNA transcripts provided evidence of active viral replication outside the respiratory tract in three of five patients. Interpretation: Our series supports clinical data showing that the four dominant interrelated pathological processes in severe COVID-19 are diffuse alveolar damage, thrombosis, haemophagocytosis, and immune cell depletion. Additionally, we report here several novel autopsy findings including pancreatitis, pericarditis, adrenal micro-infarction, secondary disseminated mucormycosis, and brain microglial activation, which require additional investigation to understand their role in COVID-19.

242380,From micro to nano: evolution and impact of drug delivery in treating disease,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to evaluate a possible negative action of lockdown, during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, in the follow-up of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients. METHODS: We compared the number of JIA reactivations in the period March-July 2020 to the same months of 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: A total of 10 JIA reactivations have been documented on 58 patients (17%) visited in the period March-July 2018; 10 reactivations on 61 patients (16%) in the period March-July 2019; and 19 reactivations on 39 patients (49%) in the period March-July 2020, with a statistically significant increase (p <0.001). The other 19 patients who should have been visited during the same period, contacted by phone, indicated remission. Therefore, we hypothesize that the effective number of reactivations in the period March-July 2020 would be 19/58 patients (33%) which remains significantly greater than in the previous 2 years (p < 0.05). Among the 19 JIA patients reactivated in 2020, 3 spontaneously stopped the basic treatment due to parents' choice for fear of serious complications in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 4 had poor compliance with underlying treatment. In addition, 14/19 reactivated JIA patients did not perform the scheduled check according to the follow-up. In fact, the mean time interval between two follow-up visits was significantly greater in 2020 (157 ± 53 days, p < 0.0001) vs 2018 (108 ± 68 days) and 2019 (107 ± 40 days). CONCLUSIONS: We have found a significant increase in JIA reactivations in the period March-July 2020 compared to the same interval of 2018 and 2019. This increase may have been caused by poor compliance with background treatment, as documented in 7/19 JIA patients reactivated, and by a greater interval in follow-up checks. Therefore, it is necessary, in occasion of a new pandemic and lockdown, to implement greater controls using more appropriate telemedicine tools. Key Points â¢ COVID-19 pandemic lockdown had a negative effect on the follow-up of JIA patients. â¢ A significant increase in JIA reactivations was found during the lockdown. â¢ Poor therapeutic compliance and follow-up checks have been proven during the lockdown. â¢ It is necessary to improve telemedicine tools and scientific information during a pandemic and lockdown.","Conti, Giovanni; Galletta, Francesca; Carucci, Nicolina Stefania; La Mazza, Antonella; Mollica, Salvatore Antonio; Alibrandi, Angela; Visalli, Carmela",Clin. rheumatol,,15

Docking/DFT/POM structural analysis,2021,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has raised the visibility of health care workers to the level of public heroes. We study this phenomenon by exploring how nonphysician health care workers, who traditionally believed they were invisible and undervalued, perceive their newfound elevated status during the pandemic. Drawing from a qualitative study of 164 health care workers, we find that participants interpreted the sudden visibility and social valorization of their work as temporary and treated it with skepticism, incredulity, and as devoid of genuinely transformative power. We seek to contribute to the recent call to develop novel approaches to understanding the contours of the paradoxical nature of invisibility in the workplace by offering insights into what makes ""invisible"" workers accept or reject publicly driven elevation in their sudden social valorization.

Although evidence from then-classified studies of World War 2 showed that most people managed the stress of bombing, those vulnerable and exposed to substantial trauma had lasting or severe mental illness. Studies of different towns and occupational groups identified the proportion of people killed and wounded, the percentage of housing destroyed, and the loss of paid employment as risk factors for psychological breakdown. Mothers and children suffered not only with evacuation, but also from the trauma of bombing and damage to schools. A general association between civilian physical and psychological casualties suggests that population groups with high rates of infection and mortality might be susceptible to mental illness as a result of the pandemic. Lockdown and distancing measures contrast with the wartime sense of belonging and shared identity, reinforced by community networks and social activities.","Jones, Edgar",Lancet Psychiatry,,15

Alongside this pandemic, people have experienced a parallel infodemic, i.e., an overabundance of information, some of which misleading or even harmful, that has widely spread around the globe. Although Social Media are increasingly being used as information source, Web Search Engines, like Google or Yahoo!, still represent a powerful and trustworthy resource for finding information on the Web. This is due to their capability to capture the largest amount of information, helping users quickly identify the most relevant, useful, although not always the most reliable, results for their search queries. This study aims to detect potential misleading and fake contents by capturing and analysing textual information, which flow through Search Engines. By using a real-world dataset associated with recent CoViD-19 pandemic, we first apply re-sampling techniques for class imbalance, then we use existing Machine Learning algorithms for classification of not reliable news. By extracting lexical and host-based features of associated Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for news articles, we show that the proposed methods, so common in phishing and malicious URLs detection, can improve the efficiency and performance of classifiers. Based on these findings, we suggest that the use of both textual and URLs features can improve the effectiveness of fake news detection methods.","Mazzeo, V.; Rapisarda, A.; Giuffrida, G.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11804v2.pdf,15
248953,Presenting porous-organic-polymers as next-generation invigorating materials for nanoreactors,2021,"COVID-19 image analysis has mostly focused on diagnostic tasks using single timepoint scans acquired upon disease presentation or admission. We present a deep learning-based approach to predict lung infiltrate progression from serial chest radiographs (CXRs) of COVID-19 patients. Our method first utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from patches within the concerned lung zone, and also from neighboring and remote boundary regions. The framework further incorporates a multi-scale Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with a correlation module for effective predictions. The GRU accepts CNN feature vectors from three different areas as input and generates a fused representation. The correlation module attempts to minimize the correlation loss between hidden representations of concerned and neighboring area feature vectors, while maximizing the loss between the same from concerned and remote regions. Further, we employ an attention module over the output hidden states of each encoder timepoint to generate a context vector. This vector is used as an input to a decoder module to predict patch severity grades at a future timepoint. Finally, we ensemble the patch classification scores to calculate patient-wise grades. Specifically, our framework predicts zone-wise disease severity for a patient on a given day by learning representations from the previous temporal CXRs. Our novel multi-institutional dataset comprises sequential CXR scans from N=93 patients. Our approach outperforms transfer learning and radiomic feature-based baseline approaches on this dataset.","Konwer, Aishik; Bae, Joseph; Singh, Gagandeep; Gattu, Rishabh; Ali, Syed; Green, Jeremy; Phatak, Tej; Prasanna, Prateek",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.08330v1.pdf,15

METHODS: The current knowledge on COVID-19 and on treatment options for CRS was analyzed by a literature search in Medline, Pubmed, international guidelines, the Cochrane Library and the Internet. RESULTS: Based on international literature, on current recommendations by WHO and other international organizations as well as on previous experience, a panel of experts from EAACI and ARIA provided recommendations for the treatment of CRS during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Intranasal corticosteroids remain the standard treatment for CRS in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Surgical treatments should be reduced to a minimum and surgery preserved for patients with local complications and for those with no other treatment options. Systemic corticosteroids should be avoided.

Previously, remote home monitoring technology has been explored to augment in-person care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional in-person care was limited and CF centers rapidly adapted to a telehealth delivery model. The purpose of this study was to understand how people with CF (PwCF) and families of PwCF experienced the shift to telehealthcare delivery. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey-based study conducted in 11 CF Centers. Two surveys were designed (one for adult PwCF and one for parents/guardians of PwCF) by participating CF center members with patient and family partner input. Surveys were disseminated electronically via email/text to all patients who completed a telehealth visit, and data were collected on secure Google Forms. RESULTS: Respondents rated their telehealth experiences as positive. Most were highly satisfied with their telehealth visit (77% adult, 72% pediatric) and found the visits to be highly convenient (85% for all surveyed). A majority of patients reported they had adequate time during the visit and had all questions and concerns addressed. Importantly, we also identified concerns regarding lack of in-person assessments including pulmonary function testing (PFT) and throat/sputum culture. CONCLUSION: Telehealth was a feasible and well-accepted mechanism for delivering care in a chronic CF care model during the COVID-19 pandemic and may be useful in the post-pandemic era. Further work is needed to understand the impact of telehealth on patient outcomes, healthcare utilization and associated cost.","Jaclyn, Davis; Andrew, NeSmith; Ryan, Perkins; Julianna, Bailey; Christopher, Siracusa; Nauman, Chaudary; Powers, M; Gregory S, Sawicki; George M, Solomon",J Cyst Fibros,,15

As such, there is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to reduce the burden of COVID-19. Several vaccines, including mRNA, vector-based vaccines, and inactivated vaccines, have been approved for emergency use in various countries. However, the slow roll-out of vaccines and insufficient global supply remains a challenge to turn the tide of the pandemic. Moreover, vaccines are important tools for preventing the disease but therapeutic tools to treat patients are also needed. As such, since the beginning of the pandemic, repurposed FDA-approved drugs have been sought as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19 due to their known safety profiles and potential anti-viral effects. One of these drugs is ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic drug created in the 1970s. IVM later exerted antiviral activity against various viruses including SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we delineate the story of how this antiparasitic drug was eventually identified as a potential treatment option for COVID-19. We review SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle, the role of the nucleocapsid protein, the turning points in past research that provided initial 'hints' for IVM's antiviral activity and its molecular mechanism of action- and finally, we culminate with the current clinical findings.","Wehbe, Zena; Wehbe, Maya; Iratni, Rabah; Pintus, Gianfranco; Zaraket, Hassan; Yassine, Hadi M; Eid, Ali H",Front Immunol,,15

We suggest the hypothesis that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid, has the potential to limit the severity and progression of the disease for several reasons:- (a) High-cannabidiol Cannabis sativa extracts are able to down-regulate the expression of the two key receptors for SARS-CoV2 in several models of human epithelia, (b) cannabidiol exerts a wide range of immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects and it can mitigate the uncontrolled cytokine production responsible for acute lung injury, (c) being a PPARÎ³ agonist, it can display a direct antiviral activity and (d) PPARÎ³ agonists are regulators of fibroblast/myofibroblast activation and can inhibit the development of pulmonary fibrosis, thus ameliorating lung function in recovered patients. We hope our hypothesis, corroborated by preclinical evidence, will inspire further targeted studies to test cannabidiol as a support drug against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Esposito, Giuseppe; Pesce, Marcella; Seguella, Luisa; Sanseverino, Walter; Lu, Jie; Corpetti, Chiara; Sarnelli, Giovanni",Br. j. pharmacol,,15
263543,"A novel protocol to detect green fluorescent protein in unfixed, snap-frozen tissue",2020,"Most countries are suffering severely from the ongoing covid-19 pandemic despite various levels of preventive measures. A common question is if and when a country or region will reach herd immunity $h$. The classical herd immunity level $h_C$ is defined as $h_C=1-1/R_0$, where $R_0$ is the basic reproduction number, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity level $h_D$, after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than $h_C$. As an illustration we show that if $R_0=2.5$ in an age-structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is $h_D=43\%$ rather than $h_C=1-1/2.5=60\%$. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.","Britton, Tom; Ball, Frank; Trapman, Pieter",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03085v1.pdf,15

The objective of this study is to identify, among Madrid's adult population, the impact of COVID-19 on self-perceived vulnerability, infectiousness, aversion to germs, and other behaviors in the current situation regarding dental practice. This cross-sectional observational study involves 1,008 persons randomly surveyed on the streets of Madrid, Spain between March 1 and March 8, 2020. Their perceived vulnerability to disease was measured using the perceived vulnerability to disease scale. An additional questionnaire evaluated basic sociodemographic aspects, medical history, personal hygiene behavior, willingness to go to certain places and the perception of the risk of contagion when going to a dental practice. There are significant differences by sex on the germ aversion subscale (p < 0.05) and in the risk of waiting in the waiting room (p < 0.01), tooth extraction ((p < 0.05), endodontics (p < 0.05) and fillings ((p < 0.05).

Using COVID-19 daily death counts from New York City's five boroughs, we evaluate and compare the considered models through predictive model assessment. Our findings justify the elements included in the proposed model. The proposed model is further applied to time series of COVID-19 deaths from the four most populous counties in Texas.

273347,Influence of provenance origin on the early performance of two sclerophyllous Mediterranean species established in burned drylands,2021,"The lack of effective pharmaceutical interventions for SARS-CoV-2 raises the possibility of COVID-19 recurrence. We explore different post-confinement scenarios by using a stochastic modified SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model that accounts for the spread of infection during the latent period and also incorporates time-decaying effects due to potential loss of acquired immunity, people's increasing awareness of social distancing and the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our results suggest that lockdowns should remain in place for at least 60 days to prevent epidemic growth, as well as a potentially larger second wave of SARS-CoV-2 cases occurring within months. The best-case scenario should also gradually incorporate workers in a daily proportion at most 50% higher than during the confinement period. We show that decaying immunity and particularly awareness and behaviour have 99% significant effects on both the current wave of infection and on preventing COVID-19 re-emergence. Social distancing and individual non-pharmaceutical interventions could potentially remove the need for lockdowns.","López, Leonardo; Rodó, Xavier",Nat Hum Behav,,15
273505,Force of infection: a determinant of vaccine efficacy?,2021,"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome causing coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)) has recently resulted in the recent global pandemic. As convalescent plasma (CP) therapy has been used with success in several viral infections before, it has become a treatment of choice. Medical literature is reviewed for randomized controlled studies using convalescent plasma therapy.Areas covered: More than one type of neutralizing antibody against a specific microorganism may be found in both CP and hyperimmune globulins. To give a standard titer of a specific neutralizing antibody to a patient, a reliable antibody titration assay should be developed. It is challenging to test the efficacy of the CP and HIG therapies with double-blind studies. There is a difficulty in the standardization of the CP and HIG study groups, as patients use various additional therapies. Different amounts and titers of CP and HIG and different titers of CP are used in patients. This review discusses the current knowledge on CP and HIG therapies used in COVID-19 disease.Expert opinion: The immune response to COVID-19 have diverse characteristics. The antibody produced after COVID-19 disease and vaccination is short-lived. Thus, CP should be an alternative especially in patients with lymphopenia and primary/secondary antibody deficiency.","Cagdas, Deniz",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,,15

OBJECTIVE: We describe the demographic characteristics of patients who died of COVID-19, observation of frequent rapid response team/cardiac arrest (RRT/CA) calls for non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and factors that contributed to RRT/CA calls. METHODS: A team of registered nurses reviewed the medical records of inpatients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction before or on admission and who died between March 13 (first Northwell Health inpatient expiration) and April 30, 2020, at 15 Northwell Health hospitals. The findings for these patients were abstracted into a database and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Of 2634 patients who died of COVID-19, 1478 (56.1%) had oxygen saturation levels &#8805;90% on presentation and required no respiratory support. At least one RRT/CA was called on 1112/2634 patients (42.2%) at a non-ICU level of care. Before the RRT/CA call, the most recent oxygen saturation levels for 852/1112 (76.6%) of these non-ICU patients were at least 90%. At the time the RRT/CA was called, 479/1112 patients (43.1%) had an oxygen saturation of <80%. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents one of the largest reviewed cohorts of mortality that also captures data in nonstructured fields. Approximately 50% of deaths occurred at a non-ICU level of care despite admission to the appropriate care setting with normal staffing. The data imply a sudden, unexpected deterioration in respiratory status requiring RRT/CA in a large number of non-ICU patients. Patients admitted at a non-ICU level of care suffered rapid clinical deterioration, often with a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation. These patients could benefit from additional monitoring (eg, continuous central oxygenation saturation), although this approach warrants further study.","Jarrett, Mark; Schultz, Susanne; Lyall, Julie; Wang, Jason; Stier, Lori; De Geronimo, Marcella; Nelson, Karen",J Med Internet Res,,15

The early diagnosed cases were mainly imported cases, and the later diagnosed ones were mainly local cases. The most common first symptom was fever; moderate fever was commonly seen in imported cases whereas low fever was commonly seen in local cases. Lymphocyte counts in the imported group were lower than those in the local group. The imported group showed more advanced and severe abnormalities in the CT scan whereas the local group showed milder pulmonary abnormalities. The proportion of severe and critically severe patients in the imported group was higher than that in the local group.

While their transferability to one target domain held by a dataset has been widely addressed using traditional domain adaptation strategies, the question of their cross-domain transferability is still under-studied. We study here in what extent neural ranking models catastrophically forget old knowledge acquired from previously observed domains after acquiring new knowledge, leading to performance decrease on those domains. Our experiments show that the effectiveness of neuralIR ranking models is achieved at the cost of catastrophic forgetting and that a lifelong learning strategy using a cross-domain regularizer success-fully mitigates the problem. Using an explanatory approach built on a regression model, we also show the effect of domain characteristics on the rise of catastrophic forgetting.

We aimed to understand patterns of attitudes and beliefs about the COVID-19 vaccine to inform vaccination campaigns. 583 English speaking United States adults were surveyed November 18-29, 2020. Participants answered 11 questions about their attitudes and beliefs about a COVID-19 vaccine, including perceived vaccine effectiveness, likelihood of getting vaccinated, and concerns that vaccine development was rushed/influenced by politics. We conducted a latent class analysis to identify profiles of attitudes/beliefs about a COVID-19 vaccine. We identified four classes of COVID-19 vaccine beliefs. The pro-vaccine class (28.8%) was willing to get vaccinated and had broadly positive beliefs about the vaccine. The development concerns class (27.8%) was willing to get vaccinated but was concerned about the development process. The third class (22.6%) was largely unsure if they would get vaccinated and if their peer groups would be vaccinated. The forth class (anti-vaccine, 20.8%) was dominated by an unwillingness to get vaccinated, vaccine distrust, vaccine development concerns, and peers groups with negative vaccine intentions. Given the large proportion of individuals who were concerned about the COVID-19 vaccine development process, messaging about rigor and approval processes may be critical to securing this group’s commitment to vaccination.

Data evaluating agents with potential antiviral activity continue to expand, such that updated guidance is needed regarding use of these agents in children. METHODS: A panel of pediatric infectious diseases physicians and pharmacists from 20 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a set of guidance statements was developed and refined based on review of the best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: Given the typically mild course of COVID-19 in children, supportive care alone is suggested for most cases. For children with severe illness, defined as a supplemental oxygen requirement without need for non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), remdesivir is suggested, preferably as part of a clinical trial if available. Remdesivir should also be considered for critically ill children requiring invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO. A duration of 5 days is appropriate for most patients. The panel recommends against the use of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir (or other protease inhibitors) for COVID-19 in children. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 is not necessary for the great majority of pediatric patients.

Companies in all sectors have to be adaptive and flexible in order to survive in this complex and hardly unpredictable business environment. At first glance ICT sector is not so severely and visibly affected by the COVID-19 economic crisis. Due to numerous reasons companies from the sector have so far shown an enviable level of flexibility and adaptability to the rapid changes in business environment conditions. As a response to the anti-epidemiological requirements, most often used tool from ICT companies is to transform working processes from office to home, following the line of social isolation. In this regard the major objective of the current article is to reveal the specifics of home office work in ICT companies and its impact on the employees' motivation in terms of their perceptions and level of commitment to the achievement of companies goals. For this purpose we used questionnaire survey among employees working in different job positions in ICT companies in Bulgaria (n=158). Our findings reveal that majority of employees (almost 80% of responders) have positive attitude to the home office as a working measure in social isolation conditions. On the other hand, home office does not significantly impact on the level of employees' motivation and their engagement to the achievement of the company's goals. Based on analysis of collected data, we propose divers measures for improving the employees satisfaction and motivation in specific context of home office work during stress crisis situation, such the pandemic is.","Anguelov, K.; Angelova, M.",Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues,,15
298538,An application of slow feature analysis to the genetic sequences of coronaviruses and influenza viruses,2021,"BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy improves outcomes for critically ill patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Data are limited on the use and benefit of tracheostomies for intubated, critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. During the surge in COVID 19 infections in metropolitan New York/New Jersey, our hospital cared for many COVID-19 patients who required prolonged intubation. This study describes the outcomes in COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy. METHODS: We present a case series of patients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy at a single institution. Tracheostomies were performed on patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation beyond 3 wk. Patient demographics, medical comorbidities, and ventilator settings prior to tracheostomy were reviewed. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included time on mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay, and discharge disposition. RESULTS: Fifteen COVID-19 patients underwent tracheostomy at an average of 31 d post intubation. Two patients (13%) died. Half of our cohort was liberated from the ventilator (8 patients, 53%), with an average time to liberation of 14 ± 6 d after tracheostomy. Among patients off mechanical ventilation, 5 (63%) had their tracheostomies removed prior to discharge. The average intensive care length of stay was 47 ± 13 d (range 29-74 d) and the average hospital stay was 59 ± 16 d (range 34-103 d). CONCLUSIONS: This study reports promising outcomes in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure and need for prolonged ventilation who undergo tracheostomy during their hospitalization. Further research is warranted to establish appropriate indications for tracheostomy in COVID-19 and confirm outcomes.","Goldstein, Carma; Deisher, David; Gorman, Elizabeth; Sheikh, Fariha; Sifri, Ziad; Glass, Nina E",J Surg Res,,15
298618,Engineering autologous tumor cell vaccine to locally mobilize antitumor immunity in tumor surgical bed,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the premarket purchase commitments for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) vaccines from leading manufacturers to recipient countries. DESIGN: Cross sectional analysis. DATA SOURCES: World Health Organization's draft landscape of covid-19 candidate vaccines, along with company disclosures to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, company and foundation press releases, government press releases, and media reports. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND DATA ANALYSIS: Premarket purchase commitments for covid-19 vaccines, publicly announced by 15 November 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Premarket purchase commitments for covid-19 vaccine candidates and price per course, vaccine platform, and stage of research and development, as well as procurement agent and recipient country. RESULTS: As of 15 November 2020, several countries have made premarket purchase commitments totaling 7.48 billion doses, or 3.76 billion courses, of covid-19 vaccines from 13 vaccine manufacturers. Just over half (51%) of these doses will go to high income countries, which represent 14% of the world's population. The US has reserved 800 million doses but accounts for a fifth of all covid-19 cases globally (11.02 million cases), whereas Japan, Australia, and Canada have collectively reserved more than one billion doses but do not account for even 1% of current global covid-19 cases globally (0.45 million cases). If these vaccine candidates were all successfully scaled, the total projected manufacturing capacity would be 5.96 billion courses by the end of 2021. Up to 40% (or 2.34 billion) of vaccine courses from these manufacturers might potentially remain for low and middle income countries-less if high income countries exercise scale-up options and more if high income countries share what they have procured. Prices for these vaccines vary by more than 10-fold, from $6.00 (£4.50; 4.90) per course to as high as $74 per course. With broad country participation apart from the US and Russia, the COVAX Facility-the vaccines pillar of the World Health Organization's Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator-has secured at least 500 million doses, or 250 million courses, and financing for half of the targeted two billion doses by the end of 2021 in efforts to support globally coordinated access to covid-19 vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an overview of how high income countries have secured future supplies of covid-19 vaccines but that access for the rest of the world is uncertain. Governments and manufacturers might provide much needed assurances for equitable allocation of covid-19 vaccines through greater transparency and accountability over these arrangements.","So, Anthony D; Woo, Joshua",BMJ,,15

MATERIALS AND METHODS: ACGME-accredited interventional radiology residency programs were identified from the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) public database, including 91 independent and 89 integrated programs. Program Webpages were then evaluated during September and October 2020 based on the presence of 48 criteria, organized into seven main categories including visibility & communication, program information, curriculum information, faculty description, research, recruitment, and salary and benefits. Programs were also evaluated based on region and research ranking. Additionally, 166 programs with accreditation for Early Specialization in Interventional Radiology (ESIR) were assessed for the presence or absence of ESIR pathway acknowledgement on program webpages. RESULTS: The online search yielded information on all integrated programs (89/89, 100%) and 74 independent programs (74/91, 80.3%). For the ESIR programs, the online search for accreditation acknowledgement yielded 108 programs (108/166, 65%) approved for this pathway. Only seven of the 89 integrated programs met at least 75% of the criteria. Of the 91 independent programs, only one met at least 75% of the criteria. On average, integrated programs met more criteria (25, 52%) than independent programs (17, 36%). When comparing programs based on national rank, the visibility & communication category met more criteria on average than the lower ranked programs (integrated =73% vs. 64%, pâ¯=â¯0.01), (independentâ¯=â¯73% vs. 45%, pâ¯=â¯0.01). When comparing programs regionally, statistical significance was found only in the research category (pâ¯=â¯0.01). When comparing the integrated programs with the independent programs for averages in the 7 categories and the total criteria, statistical significance was found in all categories except facility description: visibility & communication (67.5% vs. 53. 7%, pâ¯=â¯0.01), program information (75.7% vs. 58%, pâ¯=â¯0.01), curriculum information (54.8% vs. 31.4, pâ¯=â¯0.01), research (42.5% vs. 27.5%, pâ¯=â¯0.01), recruitment (42.6% vs. 26.8%, pâ¯=â¯0.01), salary & benefits (47.8% vs. 26.8%, pâ¯=â¯0.01), and total criteria (52% vs. 35.8%, pâ¯=â¯0.01. CONCLUSION: IR residency programs across the country are proficient in providing curricular, and logistical information online. However, improvement is needed in providing nonacademic highlights unique to programs that can aid in maximizing applicant match and compatibility. The information provided by online resources has the potential to influence residency applicant's program ranking and chosen pathway, particularly during the COVID19 pandemic.","Makary, Mina S; Niedermeier, Marilyn; Grewal, B K; Heilala, Adam; Ahmed, Osman",Acad. radiol,,15

300867,"The challenge of intracellular antibiotic accumulation, a function of fluoroquinolone influx versus bacterial efflux",2020,"Mineral extraction has resulted in widespread stream impairment due to habitat degradation and water quality impacts from acid mine drainage (AMD). The North Fork of Clear Creek (NFCC), Colorado, USA was historically impaired by AMD from two major point-source inputs, with some stream segments devoid of aquatic life prior to remediation. In the summer of 2017, the North Clear Creek Water Treatment Plant (NCCWTP) began AMD water treatment. To predict and characterize the biological recovery of NFCC to improvements in water quality, we conducted stream mesocosm and field experiments, as well as biomonitoring of benthic communities using a Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) study design. The NFCC stream community responded rapidly to improved water quality. Benthic algal biomass increased at impacted sites and macroinvertebrate surveys showed significant increases in abundance, taxa richness, and emerging adult aquatic insects. However, the dominant taxa colonizing downstream segments of NFCC differed considerably from those predicted based on previous field and experimental results. We hypothesize that this discrepancy is the result of differences in metal exposure regimes observed between our field and mesocosm approaches (i.e., fluctuating vs stable), colonization attributes (i.e., open vs closed system), and spatiotemporal differences in metal sensitivity due to macroinvertebrate phenology. We expect continued biological recovery in NFCC, but habitat impairment and residual sources of metals will continue to impair aquatic life until those stressors abate. Applying a combination of controlled experimental and BACI field approaches to predict and evaluate AMD-remediation projects in the future will improve the ability to understand the physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms influencing stream recovery.","Kotalik, Christopher J; Cadmus, Pete; Clements, William H",Sci Total Environ,,15

However, such policies have grave social and economic costs, and so it is important to pre-assess their impacts. In this work we aim to visualize the dynamics of the pandemic in a city under different intervention policies, by simulating the behavior of the residents. We develop a very detailed agent-based model for a city, including its residents, physical and social spaces like homes, marketplaces, workplaces, schools/colleges etc. We parameterize our model for Kolkata city in India using ward-level demographic and civic data. We demonstrate that under appropriate choice of parameters, our model is able to reproduce the observed dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic in Kolkata, and also indicate the counter-factual outcomes of alternative intervention policies.","Suryawanshi, Gaurav; Madhavan, Varun; Mitra, Adway; Chakrabarti, Partha Pratim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01650v2.pdf,15

However, it remains challenging to control the generation results. Previous approaches such as prompting are far from sufficient, which limits the usage of language models. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative method, inverse prompting, to better control text generation. The core idea of inverse prompting is to use generated text to inversely predict the prompt during beam search, which enhances the relevance between the prompt and the generated text and provides better controllability. Empirically, we pre-train a large-scale Chinese language model to perform a systematic study using human evaluation on the tasks of open-domain poem generation and open-domain long-form question answering. Our results show that our proposed method substantially outperforms the baselines and that our generation quality is close to human performance on some of the tasks.

308649,Recent advances in influenza vaccines,2020,"Viral infections pose significant health challenges globally by affecting millions of people worldwide and consequently resulting in a negative impact on both socioeconomic development and health. Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a clear example of how a virus can have a global impact in the society and has demonstrated the limitations of detection and diagnostic capabilities globally. Another virus which has posed serious threats to world health is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which is a lentivirus of the retroviridae family responsible for causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Even though there has been a significant progress in the HIV biosensing over the past years, there is still a great need for the development of point of care (POC) biosensors that are affordable, robust, portable, easy to use and sensitive enough to provide accurate results to enable clinical decision making. The aim of this study was to present a proof of concept for detecting HIV-1 pseudoviruses by using anti-HIV1 gp41 antibodies as capturing antibodies. In our study, glass substrates were treated with a uniform layer of silane in order to immobilize HIV gp41 antibodies on their surfaces. Thereafter, the HIV pseudovirus was added to the treated substrates followed by addition of anti-HIV gp41 antibodies conjugated to selenium nanoparticle (SeNPs) and gold nanoclusters (AuNCs). The conjugation of SeNPs and AuNCs to anti-HIV gp41 antibodies was characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and zeta potential while the surface morphology was characterized by fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy. The UV-vis and zeta potential results showed that there was successful conjugation of SeNPs and AuNCs to anti-HIV gp41 antibodies and fluorescence microscopy showed that antibodies immobilized on glass substrates were able to capture intact HIV pseudoviruses. Furthermore, AFM also confirmed the capturing HIV pseudoviruses and we were able to differentiate between substrates with and without the HIV pseudoviruses. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of biomolecules related to HIV and therefore this system has potential in HIV biosensing applications.","Lebohang Manoto, Sello; El-Hussein, Ahmed; Malabi, Rudzani; Thobakgale, Lebogang; Ombinda-Lemboumba, Saturnin; Attia, Yasser A; Kasem, Mohamed A; Mthunzi-Kufa, Patience",,,15

The objective of this study was to measure the impact of in-situ simulation on the confidence of the surgical teams of two hospitals in assessing and managing acutely unwell surgical patients who are high-risk or confirmed to have COVID-19. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental study with a pretest-posttest design. The surgical teams at each hospital participated in multi-disciplinary simulation sessions to explore the assessment and management of a patient requiring emergency surgery who is high risk for COVID-19. The participants were surveyed before and after receiving simulation training to determine their level of confidence on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for the premise stated in each of the nine questions in the survey, which represented multiple aspects of the care of these patients. RESULTS: 27 participants responded the pre-simulation survey and 24 the one post-simulation. The level of confidence (VAS score) were statistically significantly higher for all nine questions after the simulation. Specific themes were identified for further training and changes in policy. CONCLUSION: In-situ simulation is an effective training method. Its versatility allows it to be set up quickly as rapid-response training in the face of an imminent threat.

However, this unusual fact does not end with the teaching–learning process, forcing all educational institutions, as well as the teaching community to reinvent themselves to continue with online teaching. This is the only possible way to do it. The authors must face a specific scenario to readapt the learning-teaching process. The way of teaching of the University of La Rioja is online but it will have to face some problems. The Polytechnic University of Madrid classroom education is compulsory, so there is a big gap between what teachers are used to and what they will have to face. This crisis makes us reflect on new technologies as necessary and essential tools in the new teaching–learning scenario presented.

The impact of telehealth on patient satisfaction during the current pandemic is yet to be fully understood. Objective: This study aimed to identify patient perspectives and behaviors toward virtual primary care appointments at a telehealth-naïve institution during the COVID-19 pandemic and establish the rate of missed appointments to help guide future implementation of telehealth services. Methods: Patients at a primary and specialty care clinic, seen between March and May 2020, completed a survey analyzing nine commonly used satisfaction metrics. The rate of missed appointments was recorded and compared with analogous cohorts of in-person office visits. Results: The no-show rate of telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic was 7.5% (14/186), lower than both the no-show rate of 36.1% for in-office visits (56/155) (p < 0.0001) and a pre-pandemic in-office no-show rate of 29.8% (129/433) (p < 0.0001). Surveyed patients who experienced telehealth visits (n = 65) had similar satisfaction compared with those surveyed who attended in-office visits (n = 36) in seven of nine metrics. No statistically significant differences were identified in the satisfaction metrics with telehealth visits performed on video (n = 26) versus the phone-only format (n = 38). Patients aged 65 years or over were less likely to have a video component to their virtual visit (1/12, 8.3%) than those under age 65 (25/44, 56.8%) (p = 0.0031).

Emerging data from China and Europe have consistently shown an increased incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE). We aimed to identify the VTE incidence and early predictors of VTE at our high-volume tertiary care center. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 147 patients who had been admitted to Temple University Hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from April 1, 2020 to April 27, 2020. We first identified the VTE (pulmonary embolism [PE] and deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) incidence in our cohort. The VTE and no-VTE groups were compared by univariable analysis for demographics, comorbidities, laboratory data, and treatment outcomes. Subsequently, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the early predictors of VTE. RESULTS: The 147 patients (20.9% of all admissions) admitted to a designated COVID-19 unit at Temple University Hospital with a high clinical suspicion of acute VTE had undergone testing for VTE using computed tomography pulmonary angiography and/or extremity venous duplex ultrasonography. The overall incidence of VTE was 17% (25 of 147). Of the 25 patients, 16 had had acute PE, 14 had had acute DVT, and 5 had had both PE and DVT. The need for invasive mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio, 3.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-9.55) and the admission D-dimer level &#8805;1500 ng/mL (adjusted odds ratio, 3.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-9.78) were independent markers associated with VTE. The all-cause mortality in the VTE group was greater than that in the non-VTE group (48% vs 22%; P = .007). CONCLUSION: Our study represents one of the earliest reported from the United States on the incidence rate of VTE in patients with COVID-19. Patients with a high clinical suspicion and the identified risk factors (invasive mechanical ventilation, admission D-dimer level &#8805;1500 ng/mL) should be considered for early VTE testing. We did not screen all patients admitted for VTE; therefore, the true incidence of VTE could have been underestimated. Our findings require confirmation in future prospective studies.","Rali, Parth; O039,; Corragain, Oisin; Oresanya, Lawrence; Yu, Daohai; Sheriff, Omar; Weiss, Robert; Myers, Catherine; Desai, Parag; Ali, Nadia; Stack, Anthony; Bromberg, Michael; Lubitz, Andrea L; Panaro, Joseph; Bashir, Riyaz; Lakhter, Vladimir; Caricchio, Roberto; Gupta, Rohit; Dass, Chandra; Maruti, Kumaran; Lu, Xiaoning; Rao, A Koneti; Cohen, Gary; Criner, Gerard J; Choi, Eric T",J.

Results: We determined the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells by the appearance of the cytopathic effect three days post-infection and confirmed it by the positive results in the qRT-PCR and the immunofluorescence with convalescent serum. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy images obtained from infected cells showed the presence of structures compatible with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, a complete genome sequence obtained by next-generation sequencing allowed classifying the isolate as B.1.5 lineage. Conclusion: The evidence presented in this article confirms the first isolation of SARSCoV-2 in Colombia. In addition, it shows that this strain behaves in cell culture in a similar way to that reported in the literature for other isolates and that its genetic composition is consistent with the predominant variant in the world. Finally, points out the importance of viral isolation for the detection of neutralizing antibodies, for the genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the strain and for testing compounds with antiviral potential.","Díaz, Francisco J; Aguilar-Jiménez, Wbeimar; Flórez-Álvarez, Lizdany; Valencia, Gladys; Laiton-Donato, Katherine; Franco-Muñoz, Carlos; Álvarez-Díaz, Diego; Mercado-Reyes, Marcela; Rugeles, María Teresa",Biomedica,,15

Our objective is to evaluate which complications occurring in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 require thoracic surgery and to report the early outcomes. METHODS: This study is a single-institution retrospective case series at New York University Langone Health Manhattan campus evaluating patients with confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 infection who were hospitalized and required thoracic surgery from March 13 to July 18, 2020. RESULTS: From March 13 to August 8, 2020, 1954 patients were admitted to New York University Langone Health for Coronavirus Disease 2019. Of these patients, 13 (0.7%) required thoracic surgery. Two patients (15%) required surgery for complicated pneumothoraces, 5 patients (38%) underwent pneumatocele resection, 1 patient (8%) had an empyema requiring decortication, and 5 patients (38%) developed a hemothorax that required surgery. Three patients (23%) died after surgery, 9 patients (69%) were discharged, and 1 patient (8%) remains in the hospital. No healthcare providers were positive for Coronavirus Disease 2019 after the surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: Given the 77% survival, with a majority of patients already discharged from the hospital, thoracic surgery is feasible for the small percent of patients hospitalized with Coronavirus Disease 2019 who underwent surgery for complex pneumothorax, pneumatocele, empyema, or hemothorax. Our experience also supports the safety of surgical intervention for healthcare providers who operate on patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019.","Chang, Stephanie H; Chen, David; Paone, Darien; Geraci, Travis C; Scheinerman, Joshua; Bizekis, Costas; Zervos, Michael; Cerfolio, Robert J",J. thorac. cardiovasc. sur,,15

327278,Insights into coronavirus immunity taught by the murine coronavirus,2021,"3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-methylcathinone (methylone) is a new psychoactive substance with stimulant properties and potential for abuse. Despite its popularity, limited studies have examined relationships between brain concentrations of methylone, its metabolites, and pharmacodynamic effects. The goal of the present study was 2-fold: 1) to determine pharmacokinetics of methylone and its major metabolites-4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-N-methylcathinone (HMMC), 3,4-dihydroxy-N-methylcathinone (HHMC), and 3,4-methylenedioxycathinone (MDC)-in rat brain and plasma and 2) to relate brain pharmacokinetic parameters to pharmacodynamic effects including locomotor behavior and postmortem neurochemistry. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received subcutaneous methylone (6, 12, or 24 mg/kg) or saline vehicle (n = 16/dose), and subgroups were decapitated after 40 or 120 minutes. Plasma and prefrontal cortex were analyzed for concentrations of methylone and its metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Frontal cortex and dorsal striatum were analyzed for dopamine, 5-HT, and their metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection. Brain and plasma concentrations of methylone and its metabolites rose with increasing methylone dose, but brain methylone and MDC concentrations were greater than dose-proportional. Brain-to-plasma ratios for methylone and MDC were &#8805; 3 (range 3-12), whereas those for HHMC and HMMC were &#8804; 0.2 (range 0.01-0.2). Locomotor activity score was positively correlated with brain methylone and MDC, whereas cortical 5-HT was negatively correlated with these analytes at 120 minutes. Our findings show that brain concentrations of methylone and MDC display nonlinear accumulation. Behavioral and neurochemical effects of systemically administered methylone are related to brain concentrations of methylone and MDC but not its hydroxylated metabolites, which do not effectively penetrate into the brain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Behavioral and neurochemical effects of methylone are related to brain concentrations of methylone and its metabolite MDC but not its hydroxylated metabolites, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-N-methylcathinone and 3,4-dihydroxy-N-methylcathinone, which do not effectively penetrate into the brain. Methylone and MDC display nonlinear accumulation in the brain, which could cause untoward effects on serotonin neurons in vulnerable brain regions, including the frontal cortex.","Centazzo, Nicole; Chojnacki, Michael R; Elmore, Joshua S; Rodriguez, Raider; Acosta, Teeshavi; Suzuki, Masaki; Rice, Kenner C; Baumann, Michael H; Concheiro, Marta",J Pharmacol Exp Ther,,15

335471,The Nobel Prize for discovery of HCV is a call to end hepatitis,2020,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate volatility connectedness between major cryptocurrencies by the virtue of market capitalization. In this context, this paper implements the frequency connectedness approach of Barunik and Krehlik (2018) and to measure short-, medium- and long-term connectedness between realized volatilities of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, this paper analyzes network graphs of directional TO/FROM spillovers before and after the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic by the World Health Organization. Design/methodology/approach In this study, we examine the volatility connectedness among eight major cryptocurrencies by the virtue of market capitalization by using the frequency connectedness approach over the period July 26, 2017 and October 28, 2020. To this end, this paper computes short-, medium- and long-cycle overall spillover indexes on different frequency bands. All indexes properly capture well-known events such as the 2018 cryptocurrency market crash and COVID-19 pandemic and markedly surge around these incidents. Furthermore, owing to notably increased volatilities after the official announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper concentrates on network connectedness of volatility spillovers for two distinct periods, July 26, 2017-March 10, 2020 and March 11, 2020-October 28, 2020, respectively. In line with the related studies, major cryptocurrencies stand at the epicenter of the connectedness network and directional volatility spillovers dramatically intensify based on the network analysis. Findings Overall spillover indexes have fluctuated between 54% and 92% in May 2018 and April 2020. The indexes gradually escalated till November 9, 2018 and surpassed their average values (71.92%, 73.66% and 74.23%, respectively). Overall spillover indexes dramatically plummeted till January 2019 and reached their troughs (54.04%, 57.81% and 57.81%, respectively). Etherium catalyst the highest sum of volatility spillovers to other cryptocurrencies (94.2%) and is followed by Litecoin (79.8%) and Bitcoin (76.4%) before the COVID-19 announcement, whereas Litecoin becomes the largest transmitter of total volatility (89.5%) and followed by Bitcoin (89.3%) and Etherium (88.9%). Except for Etherium, the magnitudes of total volatility spillovers from each cryptocurrency notably increase after - COVID-19 announcement period. The medium-cycle network topology of pairwise spillovers indicates that the largest transmitter of total volatility spillover is Litecoin (89.5%) and followed by Bitcoin (89.3%) and Etherium (88.9%) before the COVID-19 announcement. Etherium keeps its leading role of transmitting the highest sum of volatility spillovers (89.4%), followed by Bitcoin (88.9%) and Litecoin (88.2%) after the COVID-19 announcement. The largest transmitter of total volatility spillovers is Etherium (95.7%), followed by Litecoin (81.2%) and Binance Coin (75.5%) for the long-cycle connectedness network in the before-COVID-19 announcement period. These nodes keep their leading roles in propagating volatility spillover in the latter period with the following sum of spillovers (Etherium-89.5%, Bitcoin-88.9% and Litecoin-88.1%, respectively). Research limitations/implications The study can be extended by including more cryptocurrencies and high-frequency data. Originality/value The study is original and contributes to the extant literature threefold. First, this paper identifies connectedness between major cryptocurrencies on different frequency bands by using a novel methodology. Second, this paper estimates volatility connectedness between major cryptocurrencies before and after the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic and thereby to concentrate on its impact on the cryptocurrency market. Third, this paper plots network graphs of volatility connectedness and herewith picture the intensification of cryptocurrencies due to a major financial distress event.","Polat, O.; Gunay, E.

The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy in the management of 2019-nCoV-infected patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as an open-labeled, randomized, controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at four consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past. However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of severe respiratory disease. In this study, we hope to discover evidence either supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019.

With only one opportunity to obtain samples for identification of a causative agent, it is important to ensure that sampling regimes are optimized to provide the greatest detection, without the expense and redundancy that can arise from over-sampling. This study was performed retrospectively using data from Coronial autopsies over the period 2012-2019 from which swabs from the nasopharyngeal region, trachea and lung parenchyma, in addition to samples of lung tissue, had been submitted for multiplex PCR detection of respiratory pathogens. From 97 cases with all four samples, there were 24 with at least one positive result for viral infection. Some cases had multiple positive results and a total of 27 respiratory tract viruses were identified, of which rhinovirus, influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common. Seventeen of the 27 viral infections (63%) were identified in all four samples. However, in nearly all cases (96%) the nasopharyngeal swab detected the infective agent when the multiplex PCR panel had detected infection in any of the four sample types. A nasopharyngeal swab is considered to be an optimal sample for detection of respiratory tract viral infection. As the samples analyzed were acquired before the appearance of the COVID-19 virus, the applicability of this finding for COVID-19 screening is not established.","Gilsenan-Reed, Caitlin; Higgins, Geoff; Langlois, Neil",,,15

We present our experience in managing the patients at Government-run non-COVID-19 trauma center in Delhi in an algorithmic form. Our standard operating protocols were mainly based on recommendations of Indian Orthopaedic Association and targeted to provide healthcare at a minimum risk to the treating team as well as other patients admitted to the hospital. Methodology: We describe the inflow, in-hospital management and outflow of patients at our facility during the lockdown period and in the following unlock period (from 23 March to 8 July 2020). Those patients who had absolute indications for surgery were offered surgery, while conservative treatment was more favored in those with relative indications. We also highlight the changes incorporated in OT settings as well as in rehabilitative and follow-up period. Results: Following the described protocol helped us maintain a balance between the safety of patients and our front line workers which was evident by very low COVID-19-positive rate in admitted patients (4.22%) and health care providers (16.67%) in the above-mentioned time period. Conclusions: We need to be prepared to cohabitate with this deadly Novel Coronavirus and adapt our surgical practices according to the need of the hour by minimizing surgical indications and strengthening the training in conservative principles.","Dabas, Vineet; Bhatia, Nishant; Goel, Akash; Yadav, Vedpal; Bajaj, Vineet; Kumar, Vinod",Indian J Orthop,,15

We focused on preventive and hoarding behaviors as common reactions toward the pandemic. Participants characterized by the Dark Triad traits engaged less in prevention and more in hoarding, whereas those characterized by collective narcissism engaged in more hoarding only. Coronavirus-related health beliefs mediated patterns of prevention (fully) and hoarding (partially) in the latent Dark Triad (Dark Core) and collective narcissism. However, specific beliefs worked in opposite directions, resulting in a weak indirect effect for prevention and a null indirect effect for hoarding.

We aimed to analyse the safety of the hospital staff and the feasibility and outcomes of NRS applied to patients outside the ICU. METHODS: In this observational study, data from 670 consecutive patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 referred to pulmonology units in nine hospitals between March 1 and May 10, 2020 were analysed. Data collected included medication, mode and usage of NRS (i.e. high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), noninvasive ventilation (NIV)), length of stay in hospital, endotracheal intubation (ETI) and deaths. RESULTS: 42 (11.1%) healthcare workers tested positive for infection, but only three of them required hospitalisation. Data are reported for all patients (69.3% male), whose mean±sd age was 68±13â years. The arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory oxygen fraction ratio at baseline was 152±79, and the majority (49.3%) of patients were treated with CPAP. The overall unadjusted 30-day mortality rate was 26.9%, with 16%, 30% and 30% for HFNC, CPAP and NIV, respectively, while the total ETI rate was 27%, with 29%, 25% and 28%, respectively; the relative probability of death was not related to the NRS used after adjustment for confounders. ETI and length of stay were not different among the groups. Mortality rate increased with age and comorbidity class progression. CONCLUSIONS: The application of NRS outside the ICU is feasible and associated with favourable outcomes. Nonetheless, it was associated with a risk of staff contamination.","Franco, Cosimo; Facciolongo, Nicola; Tonelli, Roberto; Dongilli, Roberto; Vianello, Andrea; Pisani, Lara; Scala, Raffaele; Malerba, Mario; Carlucci, Annalisa; Negri, Emanuele Alberto; Spoladore, Greta; Arcaro, Giovanna; Tillio, Paolo Amedeo; Lastoria, Cinzia; Schifino, Gioachino; Tabbì, Luca; Guidelli, Luca; Guaraldi, Giovanni; Ranieri, V Marco; Clini, Enrico; Nava, Stefano",Eur. respir. j,,15

370688,Computational characterization of inhaled droplet transport to the nasopharynx,2021,"Background: The molecular interactions between viral proteins form the basis of virus production and can be used to develop strategies against virus infection. The interactions of the envelope proteins and the viral RNA-binding nucleocapsid (N) protein are essential for the assembly of coronaviruses including the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Methods: Using co-immunoprecipitation, immunostaining, and proteomics analysis, we identified a protein interacting with the spike (S) protein in the cells infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. To confirm the interaction, synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal domain of the S protein (Spike CD) were produced and their effect on the interaction was investigated in vitro. In vivo effect of the Spike CD peptides after cell penetration was further investigated using viral plaque formation assay. Phylogeographic analyses were conducted to deduce homology of Spike CDs and N proteins. Results: We identified a direct interaction between the S protein and the N protein of MERS-CoV that takes place during virus assembly in infected cells. Spike CD peptides of MERS-CoV inhibited the interaction between the S and N proteins in vitro. Furthermore, cell penetration by the synthetic Spike CD peptides inhibited viral plaque formation in MERS-CoV-infected cells. Phylogeographic analyses of Spike CDs and N proteins showed high homology among betacoronavirus lineage C strains. To determine if Spike CD peptides can inhibit the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we used the same strategy and found that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike CD peptide inhibited virus replication in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Conclusions: We suggest that the interaction between the S protein and the N protein can be targeted to design new therapeutics against emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.","Park, Byoung Kwon; Kim, Jinsoo; Park, Sangkyu; Kim, Dongbum; Kim, Minyoung; Baek, Kyeongbin; Bae, Joon-Yong; Park, Man-Seong; Kim, Won-Keun; Lee, Younghee; Kwon, Hyung-Joo",Theranostics,,15

More than one study reported a significant decrease in acute coronary syndrome admissions during that pandemic which is still due to unknown reasons. METHODS: This is a retrospective non-controlled multi-centered study of 180 patients (117 males and 63 females) with acute coronary syndrome (STEMI and NSTEMI) admitted during March/April of 2019 and March/April 2020 in Upstate New York. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients (61.9% males, 38.1% females) with a mean age of 72.3â¯±â¯14.2 presented during March/April 2019 with ACS (STEMI + NSTEMI) while only 67 (70.1% males, 29.9% females) COVID-19 negative patients with a mean age of 65.1â¯±â¯14.5 presented during the same period (March/April) in 2020. This is a drop by 40.7% (Pâ¯<â¯.05) of total ACS cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. In NSTEMI patients, 36.4% presented late (>24 hours of symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison with 2019 (27.1%, Pâ¯=â¯.033). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a substantial drop by 40.7% (Pâ¯<â¯.05) of total ACS admissions in our area. This decrease in hospital admissions and late presentations can be a worrisome sign for an increase in future complications of myocardial infarctions.","Braiteh, Nabil; Rehman, Wajeeh Ur; Alom, Md; Skovira, Vincent; Breiteh, Nour; Rehman, Ibraheem; Yarkoni, Alon; Kahsou, Hisham; Rehman, Afzal",Am Heart J,,15
375305,Recognition of potential Covid-19 drug treatments through the study of existing protein-drug and protein-protein structures: an analysis of kinetically active residues,2020-04-21,"This short commentary explores Richard Slaughter’s foresight practice – his strategies and methods for approaching futures thinking and futures doing. I concentrate on three areas where Richard has made significant strategic and methodological innovations that have carried the futures field forward. First, I discuss his foundational work to give futures studies genuine disciplinary status through the development of critical futures studies. I explore his use of critique, his advocacy of dissent and his expansion of the methodological repertoire of the field. Second, I note his valiant attempts to emancipate foresight practice through the concept of social foresight. Richard’s vision of the routine application of foresight across society, supported by institutions of foresight and a thriving critical discipline is a compelling one. While social foresight remains a vision, Richard provided guidance on how to get there that remains highly relevant. Finally, I outline Richard’s pioneering translation of Ken Wilber’s philosophy into an integral futures practice. While there have been controversies along the way, the development of Wilberian integral futures has undoubtedly supported more comprehensive futures thinking that gives due attention to interiors as well as exteriors.","Riedy, Chris",Futures,,15

The aim of this study was to compare patient-performed testing based on a morning saliva sample with the current standard testing method, healthcare worker-collected sampling via a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). METHODS: This was a prospective single center study which recruited 217 asymptomatic adult male participants in a COVID-19 quarantine center who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 8-10 days prior isolation. Paired NPS and saliva specimens were collected and processed within 5 hours of sample collection. Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting Envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes was performed and the results were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 160 of the 217 (74%) participants tested positive for Covid-19 based on saliva, NPS, or both testing methods. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher in saliva compared to NPS testing (93.1%, 149/160 vs 52.5%, 84/160, p<0.001). The concordance between the two tests was 45.6% (virus was detected in both saliva and NPS in 73/160), while 47.5% were discordant (87/160 tested positive for one while negative for the other). The Ct values for E and RdRp genes were significantly lower in saliva specimens compared to NP swab specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that saliva is a better alternative specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Taking into consideration, the simplicity of specimen collection, shortage of PPE and the transmissibility of the virus, saliva could enable self-collection for an accurate SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing.","Rao, Mohan; Rashid, Fairuz A; Sabri, Fashihah S A H; Jamil, Nur Nadia; Zain, Rozainanee; Hashim, Rohaidah; Amran, Fairuz; Kok, Huey Tean; Samad, Md Anuar Abd; Ahmad, Norazah",Clin. infect. dis,,15

The molecular hypoxia response pathway has been associated with such pathologies and our recent observations on anti-hypoxic and anti-inflammatory effects of whole aqueous extract of Adhatoda Vasica (AV) prompted us to explore its effects on relevant preclinical mouse models. METHODS: In this study, we tested the effect of whole aqueous extract of AV, in murine models of bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis, Cecum Ligation and Puncture (CLP) induced sepsis, and siRNA induced hypoxia-thrombosis phenotype. The effect on lung of AV treated naïve mice was also studied at transcriptome level. We also determined if the extract may have any effect on SARS-CoV2 replication. RESULTS: Oral administration AV extract attenuates increased airway inflammation, levels of transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGF-ß1), IL-6, HIF-1&#945; and improves the overall survival rates of mice in the models of pulmonary fibrosis and sepsis and rescues the siRNA induced inflammation and associated blood coagulation phenotypes in mice. We observed downregulation of hypoxia, inflammation, TGF-ß1, and angiogenesis genes and upregulation of adaptive immunity-related genes in the lung transcriptome. AV treatment also reduced the viral load in Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV2. CONCLUSION: Our results provide a scientific rationale for this ayurvedic herbal medicine in ameliorating the hypoxia-hyperinflammation features and highlights the repurposing potential of AV in COVID-19-like conditions.","Gheware, Atish; Dholakia, Dhwani; Kannan, Sadasivam; Panda, Lipsa; Rani, Ritu; Pattnaik, Bijay Ranjan; Jain, Vaibhav; Parekh, Yash; Enayathullah, M Ghalib; Bokara, Kiran Kumar; Subramanian, Venkatesan; Mukerji, Mitali; Agrawal, Anurag; Prasher, Bhavana",Respir Res,,15

Unfortunately it also clear that aspects of innate immunity can lead to severe morbidity or mortality from IAV, including inflammatory lung injury, bacterial superinfection, and exacerbation of reactive airways disease. We review broadly the virus and host factors that result in adverse outcomes from IAV and show evidence that inflammatory responses can become damaging even apart from changes in viral replication per se, with special focus on the positive and adverse effects of neutrophils and monocytes. We then evaluate in detail the role of soluble innate inhibitors including surfactant protein D and antimicrobial peptides that have a potential dual capacity for down-regulating viral replication and also inhibiting excessive inflammatory responses and how these innate host factors could possibly be harnessed to treat IAV infection. Where appropriate we draw comparisons and contrasts the SARS-CoV viruses and IAV in an effort to point out where the extensive knowledge existing regarding severe IAV infection could help guide research into severe COVID 19 illness or vice versa.","Hartshorn, Kevan L",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,15

METHODS: Patients were contacted via phone-call and a specific questionnaire was administered to evaluate the health status of these patients and to identify those who needed an ""in-person"" ambulatory visit due to the worsening of their condition. Secondarily, the patients' perception of a potential shift towards a ""telemedicine"" approach to the management of their condition and to indirectly evaluate their desire to return to ""in-person"" clinic visits. RESULTS: 607 were contacted by phone-call. 87.5% (531/607) of the cases showed stability of the symptoms so no clinic in-person or emergency visits were needed. 81.5% (495/607) of patients were more concerned about the risk of contagion than their urological condition. The median score for phone visit comprehensibility and ease of communication of exams was 5/5; whilst patients' perception of phone visits' usefulness was scored 4/5. 53% (322/607) of the interviewees didn't own the basic supports required to be able to perform a real telemedicine consult according to the required standards. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine approach limits the number of unnecessary accesses to medical facilities and represents an important tool for the limitation of the risk of transmission of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. However, infrastructures, health workers and patients should reach out to a computerization process to allow a wider diffusion of more advanced forms of telemedicine, such as televisit.","Checcucci, Enrico; De Luca, Stefano; Alessio, Paolo; Verri, Paolo; Granato, Stefano; De Cillis, Sabrina; Amparore, Daniele; Sica, Michele; Piramide, Federico; Piana, Alberto; Volpi, Gabriele; Manfredi, Matteo; Balestra, Gabriella; Autorino, Riccardo; Fiori, Cristian; Porpiglia, Francesco",World j. urol,,15

387671,A New Link to Primate Heart Development,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Communication networks among professionals can be pathways for accelerating the diffusion of innovations if some local health departments (LHDs) drive the spread of knowledge. Such a network could prove valuable during public health emergencies such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to determine whether LHDs in the United States were tied together in an informal network to share information and advice about innovative community health practices, programs, and policies. METHODS: In January and February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303 senior LHD leaders to ask several questions about their sources of advice. We asked respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices informed their work on new public health programs, evidence-based practices, and policies intended to improve community health. We used a social network analysis program to assess answers. RESULTS: A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network appeared to operate nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were repeatedly nominated by peers as sources of advice or examples (ie, opinion leaders), and 24 acted as relational bridges to hold these emergent networks together (ie, boundary spanners). Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we surveyed performed neither of these roles. CONCLUSION: Opinion leading and boundary spanning health departments can be accessed to increase the likelihood of affecting the rate of interest in and adoption of innovations. Decision makers involved in disseminating new public health practices, programs, or policies may find our results useful both for emergencies and for practice-as-usual.","Chung, Minwoong; Dekker, Debra; Gridley-Smith, Chelsea; Dearing, James W",Prev Chronic Dis,,15
387701,Analyzing development factors of cartographic production in Russia,2021,"We study an optimal movement strategy, for a population during an ongoing epidemic, among the ($D$) states/regions of a country having various levels of infection spreading. If a fraction of the agents in the population have a choice of staying in any two given states, we show that the total infected population in the country could be as low as that achieved with a complete stoppage of inter-state movements for a prolonged period, provided that the agents instead follow a stochastic strategy, used in the Minority Game, for their movement decisions between their two choices. Due to the random (but fixed in time) choices of the agents, the system essentially forms a set of $D/2$ coupled Minority Games, played simultaneously. The objective for an agent is to stay in the lower infected state between their two choices. We further show that it is the agents moving once between any two states, following the stochastic strategy, who are less likely to be infected than those not having (or not opting for) such a movement choice, when the risk of getting infected during the travel is not considered. This shows the incentive for the moving agents to follow the stochastic strategy. For the non-moving agents, the strategy is still helpful, as a complete random movement of the moving group results in a significantly higher total infection.","Biswas, Soumyajyoti; Mandal, Amit Kr",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08684v2.pdf,15

The relations between ""unclear accountability of events by some officials"" and age as well as ""failure to provide dissenting viewpoints and critical comments"" and age were statistically significant (p = 0.027Ø p = 0.014). Moreover the relation between coronavirus infected relative and ""persistent beliefs"" was statistically significant (p = 0.014). The Chi-square test showed that gender, degree, resident and education province did not affect questions answering. The greatest agreement with questions is as following: lack of real situation understanding; 89.7%, people's livelihoods, and lack of government planning for low-income groups support; 86.7%, lack of people's knowledge concerning the coronavirus; 80.8%, lack of communicative educations for crisis situations; 79.8%, false assurance as well as minimizes the risks; 78.3%. Conclusion: Identifying the non-compliance factors with health recommendations can guide health care providers and managers to implementation of beneficial intervention.","Nazari, Elham; Shahriari, Mohammad Hasan; Dadgarmoghaddam, Malihe; Saki, Azadeh; Nahidi, Mahsa; Mehrabian, Amin; Tabesh, Hamed",Inform Med Unlocked,,15

409829,Identification of loci controlling mineral element concentration in soybean seeds,2020,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiac indices can predict disease severity and survival in a multitude of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Herein, we hypothesized that CT-measured cardiac indices are correlated with severity of lung involvement and can predict survival in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with confirmed COVID-19 who underwent chest CT were enrolled. Cardiac indices including pulmonary artery-to-aorta ratio (PA/A), cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) thickness and EAT density, inferior vena cava diameter, and transverse-to-anteroposterior trachea ratio were measured by non-enhanced CT. Logistic regression and Cox-regression analyses evaluated the association of cardiac indices with patients' outcome (death vs discharge). Linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between the extent of lung involvement (based on CT score) and cardiac indices. RESULTS: Mean (±SD) age of patients was 54.55 (±15.3) years old; 65.5% were male. Increased CTR (>0.49) was seen in 52.9% of patients and was significantly associated with increased odds and hazard of death (odds ratio [OR] = 12.5, pâ¯=â¯0.005; hazard ratio = 11.4, pâ¯=â¯0.006). PA/A >1 was present in 20.7% of patients and displayed a nonsignificant increase in odds of death (ORâ¯=â¯1.9, pâ¯=â¯0.36). Furthermore, extensive lung involvement was positively associated with elevated CTR and increased PA/A (pâ¯=â¯0.001). CONCLUSION: CT-measured cardiac indices might have predictive value regarding survival and extent of lung involvement in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and could possibly be used for the risk stratification of these patients and for guiding therapy decision-making. In particular, increased CTR is prevalent in patients with COVID-19 and is a powerful predictor of mortality.","Eslami, Vahid; Abrishami, Alireza; Zarei, Ehsan; Khalili, Nastaran; Baharvand, Zahra; Sanei-Taheri, Morteza",Acad Radiol,,15

At presentation, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, however, SARS-CoV2 antibody testing was positive. Multiple inflammatory markers and cardiac biomarkers were elevated. Echocardiogram demonstrated mildly depressed left ventricular function and no coronary anomalies noted. The patient required mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and eventually extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for profound circulatory shock and progressive respiratory failure. During his clinical course, recovery of cardiac function was demonstrated however, a middle cerebral artery infarct and left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage was suffered which ultimately the patient succumbed to.

The effect of diallyl trisulfide (DATS) treatment was also examined. METHODS: BALB/c mice were exposed to tobacco smoke and treated with an NF-&#954;B inhibitor and DATS. Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect the changes of relevant indices. RESULTS: Phosphorylated inhibitor of kappa-B kinase alpha/beta expression and p65 and p50 nuclear transcription were increased by tobacco smoke exposure, whereas inhibitor of kappa-B expression was decreased. In addition, tobacco smoke reduced the expression of epithelial markers but increased that of mesenchymal and CSC markers. Our study further demonstrated that tobacco smoke-mediated EMT and CSC marker expression were attenuated by inhibition of the NF-&#954;B pathway. Moreover, DATS reversed tobacco smoke-induced NF-&#954;B pathway activation, EMT, and the acquisition of CSC properties in bladder tissues. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested that the NF-&#954;B pathway regulated tobacco smoke-induced bladder EMT, CSC marker expression, and the protective effects of DATS.","Geng, Hao; Guo, Wenhao; Feng, Lei; Xie, Dongdong; Bi, Liangkuan; Wang, Yi; Zhang, Tao; Liang, Zhaofeng; Yu, Dexin",J Int Med Res,,15

414809,Identification of human CD4+ T cell populations with distinct antitumor activity,2020,"3CL like protease (3CLpro or Mpro) is one of the main proteases of 2019-nCoV. The 3CLpro is a nonstructural protein of SARS-CoV and has an essential role in viral replication and transcription, thus, could be a potential target for anti-SARS drug development. The present study employed ligand- and structure-based approaches to identify the potent inhibitors of 2019-nCoV protease. The e-pharmacophore developed from 3CLpro-1 yielded virtual hits, that were subjected through drug likeliness and PAINS filters to remove interfering compounds. Further comprehensive docking studies, free energy calculations and ADMET studies resulted in two virtual leads- MolPort-000-410-348 and MolPort-002-530-156. The compounds MolPort-000-410-348 and MolPort-002-530-156 displayed good docking score of -12.09 and -13.38 Kcal/mol and free binding energy of -63.34 ± 2.03 and -61.52 ± 2.24 Kcal/mol, respectively. The compounds also exhibited satisfactory predicted ADMET profile and were subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) studies.

414926,Units for vigilance of emerging diseases based on wastewater treatment plants (WWTP-UVED),2020,"Rationale: Observational studies describe high sedative and analgesic medication (SA) requirements in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. High levels of SA have been shown to increase ICU length-of-stay, incidence of delirium, and mortality;all of which increase health system utilization. The aim of this study is to evaluate SA parameters in patients with COVID-19 ARDS undergoing tracheostomy. Methods: We enrolled 55 COVID-19 positive adult patients undergoing tracheostomy between 4/16/20 and 8/26/20. Cumulative dosage and sedation parameters, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) were collected in the 48-hour periods pre-and post-tracheostomy via chart review. Data analysis was performed with Microsoft Excel Analysis ToolPak. Results: Baseline characteristics include a mean age of 60.2, mean BMI of 30.2 kg/m2, 28 (51%) were male, and 39 (70.9%) of the tracheostomies were placed percutaneously. Fentanyl was used in 38 (69.1%), dexmedetomidine in 28 (50.9%), midazolam in 13 (23.6%), hydromorphone in 13 (23.6%), and propofol in 12 (21.8%) patients. •Total fentanyl dose (6940.3 mcg to 5382.2 mcg p=0.02) and total propofol dose (67066 mcg/kg to 24098 mcg/kg, p=0.02) were significantly lower post-tracheostomy compared to pre-tracheostomy (Figure 1). •There was a trend toward lower dexmedetomidine (27.7 mcg/kg to 27.4 mcg/kg, p=0.91), midazolam (183.4 mg to 133.8 mg, p=0.27), and hydromorphone (216.0 mg to 206.2 mg, p=0.72) total doses in the post-tracheostomy period. •Mean ordered RASS goals were similar in both groups (-1.1 to-0.9, p=0.12). Mean RASS deviations from goal were also similar in both groups (-0.3 vs-0.2, p=0.64). •Mean GCS values (8.4 to 9.1, p=0.007) were significantly higher in the post-tracheostomy group. Conclusions: In this retrospective cohort of COVID-19 ARDS patients undergoing tracheostomy, SA requirements were decreased in the post-tracheostomy period. Both fentanyl (22.4% reduction) and propofol (64.1% reduction) total doses were significantly lower post-tracheostomy. All other recorded SA trended toward reduction in the post-tracheostomy period but without statistical significance (Figure 1). Assessment of sedation scores showed that reduction in SA use were not associated with changes in ordered RASS goals or worse adherence to RASS goals, as these were similar in both groups. These findings suggest that the same RASS goal, and an increased GCS, may be equally obtained with less sedation in the post-tracheostomy period. We recognize the limitations of a retrospective, single-enter, cohort study. Early tracheostomy should be considered in appropriate patients to reduce SA administration and reduce health care utilization, particularly with ICU beds at a premium.","Latifi, A.; Kapp, C.; DeMaio, A.; Thiboutot, J.; Lee, H.

Predictably, the situation has elicited social and medical responses from the public and governments, respectively. Nigeria recorded an imported case from Italy on February 27, 2020. Hence, this paper assesses the early socio-medical response to COVID-19 in Nigeria in the first 100 days after the index case. The paper employs analytical methods and collates data from various media reports and official sources. FINDINGS: The incidence of COVID-19 grew steadily in Nigeria, moving from an imported case and elitist pattern to community transmission. The case fatality stood at 2.8%. The country recorded an upsurge (52% of total cases) in the transmission of COVID-19 during the short period the lockdown was relaxed. This paper presents a concise response framework to highlight some specific multisectoral responses to the pandemic. A combination of social and medical responses to a large extent helped Nigeria curtail the spread of the virus. CONCLUSION: The potential of overwhelming COVID-19 is still imminent in Nigeria as the country is attempting to hurriedly open the economy, which could sacrifice public health gains for temporary economic gains.","Amzat, Jimoh; Aminu, Kafayat; Kolo, Victor I; Akinyele, Ayodele A; Ogundairo, Janet A; Danjibo, Maryann C",Int J Infect Dis,,15

It is spherical and possesses proteins called spikes, which can clamp onto the human cells. Once in close interaction with the human cells, these viruses undergo structural change and can fuse with the cell membrane. The virus enters the host and starts the process of translation and transcription in the cells and uncoated genome, respectively. Due to the rapid transmittable nature of the virus, extant actions should be taken. The fatty acids administrated orally, or intravenously, could help us gear things up in providing resistance and preventing infection. Hence, the multiplication of the virus could be hindered by arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In that context, the current review highlights the role of these unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives such as lipoxins and resolvins in the inactivation of the enveloped coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Himani, Aryan Abhishek Saxena Archana Tiwari",Systems Microbiology and Biomanufacturing,,15

Methodological quality assessment was undertaken, resulting in a mean quality score of 4 out of a maximum of 5. Qualitative synthesis revealed EEG slowing and reduced functional connectivity discriminated between those with and without delirium (i.e. EEG during delirium); the opposite pattern was apparent in children, with cortical hyperexcitability. EEG appears to have utility in differentiating those with and without delirium, but delirium vulnerability and the long-term effects on brain function require further investigation.

423889,Construction of Molecular Model and Adsorption of Collectors on Bulianta Coal,2020,"Background: Routine services for tuberculosis (TB) are being disrupted by stringent lockdowns against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. We sought to estimate the potential long-term epidemiological impact of such disruptions on TB burden in high-burden countries, and how this negative impact could be mitigated. Methods: We adapted mathematical models of TB transmission in three high-burden countries (India, Kenya and Ukraine) to incorporate lockdown-associated disruptions in the TB care cascade. The anticipated level of disruption reflected consensus from a rapid expert consultation. We modelled the impact of these disruptions on TB incidence and mortality over the next five years, and also considered potential interventions to curtail this impact. Findings: Even temporary disruptions can cause long-term increases in TB incidence and mortality. If lockdown-related disruptions cause a temporary 50% reduction in TB transmission, we estimated that a 3-month suspension of TB services, followed by 10 months to restore to normal, would cause, over the next 5 years, an additional 1â 19 million TB cases (Crl 1â 06-1â 33) and 361,000 TB deaths (CrI 333-394 thousand) in India, 24,700 (16,100-44,700) TB cases and 12,500 deaths (8.8-17.8 thousand) in Kenya, and 4,350 (826-6,540) cases and 1,340 deaths (815-1,980) in Ukraine. The principal driver of these adverse impacts is the accumulation of undetected TB during a lockdown. We demonstrate how long term increases in TB burden could be averted in the short term through supplementary ""catch-up"" TB case detection and treatment, once restrictions are eased. Interpretation: Lockdown-related disruptions can cause long-lasting increases in TB burden, but these negative effects can be mitigated with rapid restoration of TB services, and targeted interventions that are implemented as soon as restrictions are lifted.

426796,Chemically Diverse and Biologically Active Secondary Metabolites from Marine Phylum chlorophyta,2020,"Prepping is a practice of anticipating and adaptating to impending conditions of calamity, ranging from low-level crises to extinction-level events. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which preppers consider a 'mid-level' event, and which many of them were well-prepared for, makes clear that scholarly attention to prepper's motivations and methods is both timely and valuable. Drawing from a three-year ethnographic research project with preppers, this paper traces the activity of a single bunker builder who has constructed a technically sophisticated private underground community. Supplemented by additional fieldwork, the paper argues that the boltholes preppers are building in closed communities built to survive the collapse of society, order, and even the environment itself, refract the seemingly irresolvable problems we are failing to address as a species. In the prepper ideology, faith in adaptation has supplanted hope of mitigation, making contemporary bunkers more speculative than reactionary and more temporal than spatial. The bunkers preppers build are an ark to cross through a likely (but often unspecified) catastrophe; they are a chrysalis from which to be reborn - potentially even into an improved milieu.","Garrett, Bradley",Geoforum,,15

These manifestations do not seem to share pathophysiological mechanisms, but clinical data on the subject is lacking. Aims/Objectives: This study aims to correlate the olfactory function (OF) and the radiological pulmonary involvement among in-hospital patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 were consecutively recruited. They had their objective OF evaluated by the Alcohol Sniff Test and underwent a chest computed tomography (cCT). Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the cCT scans were performed by a blinded radiologist. The quantitative assessment included both the grade of involved parenchyma and the CT severity score (CT-SS). Data obtained were then compared. RESULTS: 57 patients were included. There was no correlation between the OF and the grade of lung involvement (p-value: .884) or the CT-SS (Pearson's coefficient: -.111). Yet, patients with radiological findings on the cCT typical for COVID-19 did not present significantly different OF from the remaining (p-value: .193). Conclusions: Olfactory dysfunction does not correlate with the radiological lung involvement in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. SIGNIFICANCE: There is also clinical evidence that the olfactory disorder and the pulmonary disease in COVID-19 have distinct mechanisms.Supplemental data for this article is available online at here.","Mangia, Lucas Resende Lucinda; Soares, Marcelly Botelho; de Souza, Thiago Sasso Carmona; Scarabotto, Patrícia Cristina; De Masi, Roberta David João; Salvador, Gabriel Lucca de Oliveira; Hamerschmidt, Rogério",Acta Otolaryngol,,15
428523,SP-A and SP-D: Dual Functioning Immune Molecules With Antiviral and Immunomodulatory Properties,2020,"Introduction UK public health policy emphasises the need for increased influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic However, there are claims on social media that influenza vaccination increases risk of adverse outcomes in SARSCoV- 2 infection that may compromise uptake, especially in high risk groups such as those with airways disease There is also emerging evidence that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may modify this risk We therefore sought to urgently assess the risk of morbidity and mortality in individuals admitted with COVID-19, and whether this influenced by influenza vaccination, airways disease and ICS use Method We examined data in patients admitted to a large acute hospital with microbiologically proven COVID-19 infection (positive PCR) between 23/01/2020 to 21/06/2020 Demographic and outcome data was extracted from discharge summaries, death certificates and electronic patient records Multiple logistic regressions was performed using STATA version 12, and results for inpatient mortality expressed as odds ratios, and length of stay (morbidity) as coefficients with 95% CIs Results 525 patients were hospitalised with COVID-19 of whom 451 had a vaccination record available and 64% had been vaccinated 22% had airways disease (10% asthma, 12% COPD) and 17 5% were on an inhaled corticosteroid Increasing age (OR=1 04 [1 02, 1 05], p&lt;0 001) and male gender (OR=2 26 [1 5, 3 4], p&lt;0 001) were important predictors of inpatient mortality Previous influenza vaccination (OR=0 99 [0 6, 1 6], p=0 98), the presence of airways disease (Asthma OR=0 74 [0 4, 1 5], p=0 41, COPD OR= 1 1 [0 6, 2 0], p=0 68), and ICS use (OR=0 84 [0 3, 2 1], p=0 71) did not increase risk of in-hospital mortality and were not associated with an increased length of stay, after adjusting for age and gender Further sub-analysis including type of airways disease and dose of ICS did not change the risk Conclusions Advancing age and male gender increased the risk of in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 Furthermore previous influenza vaccination and the presence of airways disease and/or the use of ICS did not impact morbidity or mortality Whilst this requires replication using national data sets, it is reassuring data from a single centre that supports the current public health message","Morrison, L.; Wiffen, L.; Meredith, P.; Brown, T.; D039,; Cruz, L.; Chauhan, A.",Gut,,15

433033,Transforming vaccine development,2020,"We present two large datasets of labelled plant-images that are suited towards the training of machine learning and computer vision models. The first dataset encompasses as the day of writing over 1.2 million images of indoor-grown crops and weeds common to the Canadian Prairies and many US states. The second dataset consists of over 540,000 images of plants imaged in farmland. All indoor plant images are labelled by species and we provide rich etadata on the level of individual images. This comprehensive database allows to filter the datasets under user-defined specifications such as for example the crop-type or the age of the plant. Furthermore, the indoor dataset contains images of plants taken from a wide variety of angles, including profile shots, top-down shots, and angled perspectives. The images taken from plants in fields are all from a top-down perspective and contain usually multiple plants per image. For these images metadata is also available. In this paper we describe both datasets' characteristics with respect to plant variety, plant age, and number of images. We further introduce an open-access sample of the indoor-dataset that contains 1,000 images of each species covered in our dataset. These, in total 14,000 images, had been selected, such that they form a representative sample with respect to plant age and ndividual plants per species. This sample serves as a quick entry point for new users to the dataset, allowing them to explore the data on a small scale and find the parameters of data most useful for their application without having to deal with hundreds of thousands of individual images.","Beck, Michael A.; Liu, Chen-Yi; Bidinosti, Christopher P.; Henry, Christopher J.; Godee, Cara M.; Ajmani, Manisha",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05789v1.pdf,15
434743,Cell Penetrating Peptide Conjugated BF2-Oxasmaragdyrins as NIRF Imaging and Photo-Thermal Agents,2020,"Multicenter clinical and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) studies require a high degree of reproducibility across different sites and scanner manufacturers, as well as time points. We therefore implemented a multiparameter mapping (MPM) protocol based on vendor's product sequences and demonstrate its repeatability and reproducibility for whole-brain coverage. Within ~20 min, four MPM metrics (magnetization transfer saturation [MT], proton density [PD], longitudinal [R1], and effective transverse [R2*] relaxation rates) were measured using an optimized 1 mm isotropic resolution protocol on six 3 T MRI scanners from two different vendors. The same five healthy participants underwent two scanning sessions, on the same scanner, at each site. MPM metrics were calculated using the hMRI-toolbox. To account for different MT pulses used by each vendor, we linearly scaled the MT values to harmonize them across vendors. To determine longitudinal repeatability and inter-site comparability, the intra-site (i.e., scan-rescan experiment) coefficient of variation (CoV), inter-site CoV, and bias across sites were estimated. For MT, R1, and PD, the intra- and inter-site CoV was between 4 and 10% across sites and scan time points for intracranial gray and white matter. A higher intra-site CoV (16%) was observed in R2* maps. The inter-site bias was below 5% for all parameters. In conclusion, the MPM protocol yielded reliable quantitative maps at high resolution with a short acquisition time. The high reproducibility of MPM metrics across sites and scan time points combined with its tissue microstructure sensitivity facilitates longitudinal multicenter imaging studies targeting microstructural changes, for example, as a quantitative MRI biomarker for interventional clinical trials.","Leutritz, Tobias; Seif, Maryam; Helms, Gunther; Samson, Rebecca S; Curt, Armin; Freund, Patrick; Weiskopf, Nikolaus",Hum. brain mapp,,15

Given existing research on the effects of working from home on hours worked and wages, an increased availability of working from home may provide a chance for women to catch up with their male counterparts. Yet, the need to simultaneously care for children during the COVID-19 lockdown may also revive traditional gender roles, potentially counteracting such gains. We discuss the likely effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on gender gaps in the labour market and at home in light of recent empirical findings and novel statistics on the heterogeneous structure of work arrangements among couples. We construct a novel teleworkability index that differentiates between fully teleworkable, partly teleworkable and on-site jobs and find that in about a third of households the COVID-19 shock is likely to induce shifts in the intra-household allocation of tasks from mothers to fathers.","Arntz, Melanie; Ben Yahmed, Sarra; Berlingieri, Francesco",Inter Econ,,15

Implementation of lockdown and limited outdoor activities resulted in changes in routines of children with diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of lockdown on glycemic control, weight and body mass index (BMI) patterns of children with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) from different socio-economic (SE) classes. Methods This observational study included 77 children and youth (5-20 years) with T1DM having disease duration of &#8805;6 months. Demographic data and investigations were recorded at two time points (post lockdown when the children came for follow up, pre lockdown data from medical records). Results Glycemic control improved (pre lockdown HbA1C 79.4±19.2 vs. post lockdown Hba1C 74.5±16.9 mmol/mol, p<0.05) and there was weight gain post lockdown (pre lockdown weight z-score -0.4±0.8 vs. post lockdown weight z-score -0.2±0.8, p<0.05) without any significant change in BMI and insulin requirements. Improved glycemic was seen in the lower SE group control post lockdown (p<0.05), whereas in higher SE group, it remained unchanged. Children whose parents were at home during lockdown showed an improved glycemic control (p<0.05) as compared to children whose parents continued to work during lockdown (p>0.01) Conclusions During coronavirus lockdown, glycemic control was adequately maintained in children with T1DM, highlighting importance of stronger family support system leading to more steady daily routine.","Shah, Nikhil; Karguppikar, Madhura; Bhor, Shital; Ladkat, Dipali; Khadilkar, Vaman; Khadilkar, Anuradha",,,15

Because of this, our project focused on using mathematical models to evaluate strategies to suppress the spread of the virus on campus, specifically in dorms and in classrooms. For dorms, we show that giving students single rooms rather than double rooms can substantially reduce virus spread. For classrooms, we show that moving classes with size above some cutoff online can make the basic reproduction number $ R_0 < 1 $, preventing a wide spread epidemic.

We combined coarse-grained simulations, protein stability and dynamic fluctuation communication analysis with network-based community analysis to examine structures of the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in different functional states. Through distance fluctuations communication analysis, we probed stability and allosteric communication propensities of protein residues in the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, providing evidence that the D614G mutation can enhance long-range signaling of the allosteric spike engine. By combining functional dynamics analysis and ensemble-based alanine scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins we found that the D614G mutation can improve stability of the spike protein in both closed and open forms, but shifting thermodynamic preferences towards the open mutant form. Our results revealed that the D614G mutation can promote the increased number of stable communities and allosteric hub centers in the open form by reorganizing and enhancing the stability of the S1-S2 inter-domain interactions and restricting mobility of the S1 regions. This study provides atomistic-based view of allosteric communications in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, suggesting that the D614G mutation can exert its primary effect through allosterically induced changes on stability and communications in the residue interaction networks.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Nucleotide inhibitors have promising results in terms of its efficacy against different viral polymerases. In this study, detailed molecular docking and dynamics simulations are used to evaluate the binding affinity of a clinically approved drug, sofosbuvir, with the solved structure of the viral protein RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and compare it to the clinically approved drug, Remdesivir. These drugs are docked onto the three-dimensional structure of the nsp12 protein of SARS-CoV-2, which controls the polymerization process. Hence, it is considered one of the primary therapeutic targets for coronaviruses. Sofosbuvir is a drug that is currently used for HCV treatment; therefore, HCV RdRp is used as a positive control protein target. The protein dynamics are simulated for 100 ns, while the binding is tested during different dynamics states of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Additionally, the drug-protein complexes are further simulated for 20 ns to explore the binding mechanism. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as a target with the active form of sofosbuvir as a ligand demonstrates binding effectiveness. One of the FDA-approved antiviral drugs, such as sofosbuvir, can help us in this mission, aiming to limit the danger of COVID-19. Sofosbuvir was found to bind nsp12 with comparable binding energies to that of Remdesivir, which has been reported for its potential against COVID-19 RdRp and is currently approved by the FDA.","Elfiky, Abdo A; Azzam, Eman B; Shafaa, Medhat W",Mol. divers,,15

This pandemic emerged during the era of genomic epidemiology, a science fueled by continued advances in next-generation sequencing. Since its recent appearance, genomic epidemiology included the precise identification of new lineages or species of pathogens and the reconstruction of their genetic variability in real time, evidenced in past outbreaks of influenza H1N1, MERS, and SARS. However, the global and uncontrolled scale of this pandemic created a scenario where genomic epidemiology was put into practice en masse, from the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 to the registration of new lineages and their active surveillance throughout the world. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of genomic data on circulating pathogens in several Latin America and the Caribbean countries was scarce or nil. With the arrival of SARS-CoV-2, this scenario changed significantly, although the amount of available information remains scarce and, in countries such as Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, the genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained mainly by research groups in genomic epidemiology rather than the product of a public health surveillance policy or program. This indicates the need to establish public health policies aimed at implementing genomic epidemiology as a tool to strengthen surveillance and early warning systems against threats to public health in the region.","Álvarez-Díaz, Diego A; Laiton-Donato, Katherine; Franco-Muñoz, Carlos; Mercado-Reyes, Marcela",Biomedica,,15
457800,Phytochemicals from Plant Foods as Potential Source of Antiviral Agents: An Overview,2021,"Reduced magnesium (Mg) intake is a frequent cause of deficiency with age together with reduced absorption, renal wasting, and polypharmacotherapy. Chronic Mg deficiency may result in increased oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, which may be linked to several age-related diseases, including higher predisposition to infectious diseases. Mg might play a role in the immune response being a cofactor for immunoglobulin synthesis and other processes strictly associated with the function of T and B cells. Mg is necessary for the biosynthesis, transport, and activation of vitamin D, another key factor in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. The regulation of cytosolic free Mg in immune cells involves Mg transport systems, such as the melastatin-like transient receptor potential 7 channel, the solute carrier family, and the magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1).

457801,Phytochemicals from Plant Foods as Potential Source of Antiviral Agents: An Overview,2021,"Reduced magnesium (Mg) intake is a frequent cause of deficiency with age together with reduced absorption, renal wasting, and polypharmacotherapy. Chronic Mg deficiency may result in increased oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, which may be linked to several age-related diseases, including higher predisposition to infectious diseases. Mg might play a role in the immune response being a cofactor for immunoglobulin synthesis and other processes strictly associated with the function of T and B cells. Mg is necessary for the biosynthesis, transport, and activation of vitamin D, another key factor in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. The regulation of cytosolic free Mg in immune cells involves Mg transport systems, such as the melastatin-like transient receptor potential 7 channel, the solute carrier family, and the magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1). The functional importance of Mg transport in immunity was unknown until the description of the primary immunodeficiency XMEN (X-linked immunodeficiency with Mg defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and neoplasia) due to a genetic deficiency of MAGT1 characterized by chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection.

Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Central Database, and medRvix from inception up to July 13, 2020 on research articles that enrolled hip fracture patients who had information on COVID-19 and clinically validated definition of death. Results: A total of 984 participants from 6 studies were included in our study. The pooled prevalence of COVID-19 was 9% [95% CI: 7-11%]. The mortality rate in patients with concomitant hip fracture and COVID-19 was found to be 36% (95% CI: 26-47%), whereas the mortality rate in hip fracture without COVID-19 is 2% (95% CI: 1-3%). Meta-analysis showed that COVID-19 was associated with a seven-fold increase in risk (RR 7.45 [95% CI: 2.72, 20.43], pâ¯<â¯0.001; I2: 68.6%) of mortality in patients with hip fracture.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective single institution study. We defined palliative radiotherapy (PRT) initiated before Saturday, March 14th as pre-COVID and PRT initiated later as during-COVID (through June 30th). RESULTS: National COVID-19 recommendations led to a significant decrease in PRT with 10 or more fractions, while re-irradiation and radiotherapy during the final 30 days of life were equally common before and after these recommendations had been issued in March 2020. CONCLUSION: Rapid adoption of modified PRT regimens was feasible. However, the challenge of overtreatment in the final phase of the disease, due to inaccurate survival prediction, persisted.","Nieder, Carsten; Haukland, Ellinor C; Mannsaker, Bard; Yobuta, Rosalba",In Vivo,,15
464940,Asymmetric Dehydrative Allylation Using Soft Ruthenium and Hard Brønsted Acid Combined Catalyst,2021,"Visiting nature is positively associated with physical and mental well-being. The role of nature became more pronounced during the coronavirus outbreak in the spring of 2020. Countries all over the world implemented confinement measures to reduce the transmission of the virus. These included but were not limited to the cancelation of public events, schools, and non-essential businesses and the prohibition of non-essential travels. However, going outside to exercise was recommended by the Belgian government. During this period, we conducted an online survey to determine if people visit nature more frequently than before and to identify the factors that contribute to this. The results are based on data from 11,352 participants in Flanders, Belgium. With the use of a bivariate and multiple regression analysis, results indicate that people visit nature more frequently than before and that nature helped to maintain social relationships during the coronavirus period. Gardens were reported to be the most popular place, followed by parks. More than half of the people experienced nature in a more positive way, and the belief that nature visits are important for general health increased. In addition, we found a positive association between nature visits and home satisfaction, as well as a positive association with subjective mental and physical health. Lastly, we identified several demographic factors contributing to the frequency of nature visits such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Our findings indicate the importance of nature visits for general well-being and highlight the need for nearby green infrastructure.","Lenaerts, Aline; Heyman, Sofie; De Decker, Annelies; Lauwers, Laura; Sterckx, Ann; Remmen, Roy; Bastiaens, Hilde; Keune, Hans",Front Public Health,,15

467639,A naturalistic method to test depression: Anticipation of play,2020,"Optical biosensors are low-cost, sensitive and portable devices that are poised to revolutionize the medical industry. Healthcare monitoring has already been transformed by such devices, with notable recent applications including heart rate monitoring in smartwatches and COVID-19 lateral flow diagnostic test kits. The commercial success and impact of existing optical sensors has galvanized research in expanding its application in numerous disciplines. Drug detection and monitoring seeks to benefit from the fast-approaching wave of optical biosensors, with diverse applications ranging from illicit drug testing, clinical trials, monitoring in advanced drug delivery systems and personalized drug dosing. The latter has the potential to significantly improve patients' lives by minimizing toxicity and maximizing efficacy. To achieve this, the patient's serum drug levels must be frequently measured. Yet, the current method of obtaining such information, namely therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), is not routinely practiced as it is invasive, expensive, time-consuming and skilled labor-intensive. Certainly, optical sensors possess the capabilities to challenge this convention. This review explores the current state of optical biosensors in personalized dosing with special emphasis on TDM, and provides an appraisal on recent strategies. The strengths and challenges of optical biosensors are critically evaluated, before concluding with perspectives on the future direction of these sensors.","Ong, Jun Jie; Pollard, Thomas D; Goyanes, Alvaro; Gaisford, Simon; Elbadawi, Mohammed; Basit, Abdul W",Biosens Bioelectron,,15

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19; to determine the possible relationship between the severity of pulmonary involvement and D-dimer levels; to analyze the location of pulmonary embolisms in patients with COVID-19 and to compare it with the location in patients without COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed all CT angiograms of the pulmonary arteries done in patients with suspected pulmonary embolisms between March 15 and April 30, 2020 and compared them with studies done in the same period one year earlier. RESULTS: We included 492 pulmonary CT angiograms (342 (69.9%) in patients with COVID-19 and 147 (30.1%) in patients without COVID-19). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms was higher in patients with COVID-19 (26% vs. 16.3% in patients without COVID-19, p=0.0197; relative risk=1.6). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms in the same period in 2019 was 13.2%, similar to that of the group of COVID-19-negative patients in 2020 (p=0.43). There were no significant differences in D-dimer levels or the location of pulmonary embolisms between the two groups. CT showed moderate or severe pulmonary involvement in 78.7% of the patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 have an increased prevalence of pulmonary embolisms (26%), and most (78.7%) have moderate or severe lung involvement on CT studies. The location of pulmonary embolisms and the degree of elevation of D-dimer levels does not differ between patients with COVID-19 and those without.","Martínez Chamorro, E; Revilla Ostolaza, T Y; Pérez Núñez, M; Borruel Nacenta, S; Cruz-Conde Rodríguez-Guerra, C; Ibáñez Sanz, L",Radiologia,,15
474462,Ran participates in deltamethrin stress through regulating the nuclear import of Nrf2,2020,"Convalescent Plasma Therapy is an investigational therapeutic method recommended as a treatment strategy for COVID-19 as vaccines, and proper treatment methods were unavailable. The therapy involves transfusing antibody contained plasma from the COVID recovered individuals (donors) into critically affected patients. It can accelerate the recovery of the recipient. The effectiveness of antibodies is affected by the health and clinical history of donors, according to research. It implies the possibility of implementing Machine Learning Classification models for predicting the Eligible donors (who meet the threshold antibody level for donation) and Regression models to predict the antibody level value of a donor from the person's clinical history before conducting tests for the same. The proposed system can help the health authorities approach the most probably efficient donors for the therapy rather than wasting time and test kits on a random donor who may or may not be eligible. The results from various ML algorithms trained on a synthetic clinical history dataset are examined and assessed as significant to some degree. The system has to be validated against real data to arrive at reasonable conclusions.

Tobacco is a model plant for studying the molecular regulation of flower coloration. We investigated the mechanism underlying flower coloration in tobacco by profiling flavonoid metabolites,expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic structural genes and their regulator genes in the pink-flowered tobacco cultivar Yunyan 87 and white-flowered Yunyan 87 mutant. RESULT: Significant down-accumulation of anthocyanins, including cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, cyanin, cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside, pelargonidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside, cyanidin O-syringic acid, pelargonin, and pelargonidin 3-O-malonylhexoside (log2 fold change < - 10), endowed the flower color mutation in Yunyan 87 mutant. Transcriptome analysis showed that the coordinately down-regulated anthocyanin biosynthetic genes including chalcone isomerase, naringenin 3-dioxygenase, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase and UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase played critical roles in suppressing the formation of the aforesaid anthocyanins. Several genes encoding MYB and bHLH transcription factors were also found down-regulated, and probably the reason for the suppression of structural genes. CONCLUSION: This is the first study of tobacco flower coloration combining metabolome and transcriptome analyses, and the results shed a light on the systematic regulation mechanisms of flower coloration in tobacco. The obtained information will aid in developing strategies to modify flower color through genetic transformation.","Jiao, Fangchan; Zhao, Lu; Wu, Xingfu; Song, Zhongbang; Li, Yongping",BMC Genomics,,15

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Citation bias was investigated by assessing the degree of agreement between evidence provided by a remdesivir randomized controlled trial and its citing articles. The dissimilarity of outcomes derived from nonrandomized and randomized studies was tested by a meta-analysis of hydroxychloroquine effects on mortality. The differential influence of studies with beneficial over those with neutral results was evaluated by a bibliometric analysis. RESULTS: The articles citing the ACTT-1 remdesivir trial preferentially presented its positive outcomes in 55.83% and its negative outcomes in 6.43% of cases. The hydroxychloroquine indicated no significant effect by randomized studies, but a significant survival benefit by nonrandomized ones. Citation mapping revealed that the study reporting survival benefit from the hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination was the most influential, despite subsequent studies reporting potential harmful effects. CONCLUSION: The present study raises concerns about citation bias and a predilection of reporting beneficial over harmful effects in the Covid-19 treatment research, potentially in the context of white hat bias. Preregistration, data sharing and avoidance of selective reporting are crucial to ensure the credibility of future research.","Bellos, Ioannis",J Clin Epidemiol,,15

To estimate the critical care bed capacity that would be required to admit all critical COVID-19 cases in a setting of unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, both with and without elderly-specific protection measures.Methods. Using electronic health records of all 2432 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a large hospital in Madrid, Spain, between February 28 and April 23, 2020, we estimated the number of critical care beds needed to admit all critical care patients. To mimic a hypothetical intervention that halves SARS-CoV-2 infections among the elderly, we randomly excluded 50% of patients aged 65 years and older.Results. Critical care requirements peaked at 49 beds per 100 000 on April 1-2 weeks after the start of a national lockdown. After randomly excluding 50% of elderly patients, the estimated peak was 39 beds per 100 000.Conclusions. Under unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, peak critical care requirements in Madrid were at least fivefold higher than prepandemic capacity. Under a hypothetical intervention that halves infections among the elderly, critical care peak requirements would have exceeded the prepandemic capacity of most high-income countries.Public Health Implications.

Despite this, it has been reported that a minority of people do not comply with the governmental guidelines. When considering the reasons why some people do not comply with preventive measures, previous studies have shown that beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories negatively predict responsible pandemic-related behaviour. This, in turn, could seriously undermine success in combating the pandemic. Our aim was, therefore, to further investigate the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and adherence to official COVID-19 medical guidelines by including mediating roles of beliefs in pseudoscientific information and trust in government officials. A total of 1882 adults from Croatia provided sociodemographic information and completed several scales related to COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, beliefs in pseudoscientific information, trust in government officials, and adherence to official COVID-19 guidelines. A multiple mediation analysis revealed a direct negative effect of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs on compliance with the preventive measures. In addition, conspiracy beliefs were indirectly related to compliance via trust in government officials. The present study builds upon emerging research showing that conspiracy beliefs may have significant social consequences and pose a potential risk to public health. Practical implications of these findings are discussed further.

We conducted a survey to evaluate willingness-to-participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials in a population of HCWs at three hospitals in Uganda. METHODS: The survey was conducted between September and November 2020. Using a standardised questionnaire, data were collected on socio-demographics, previous participation in health research, COVID-19 information sources, underlying health conditions, and willingness-to-participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Data were analysed descriptively and a binomial generalised linear model with a log link function used to investigate factors associated with unwillingness to participate. RESULTS: 657 HCWs (female, 63%) were enrolled with a mean age of 33 years (Standard Deviation, 10). Overall willingness-to-participate was 70.2%. Key motivating factors for participation were: hope of being protected against COVID-19 (81.1%), altruism (73.3%), and the opportunity to get health care (26.0%). Selected hypothetical trial attributes reduced willingness-to-participate as follows: weekly-quarterly study visits over a 12-month period (70.2%-63.2%, P = 0.026); provision of approximately 50ml of blood at each study visit (70.2%-63.2%, P = 0.026); risk of mild-moderate local adverse reactions (70.2%-60.3%, P<0.001); chance of receiving candidate vaccine or placebo (70.2%-56.9%, P<0.001); and delay of pregnancy [Overall, 70.2%-57.1% P<0.001); Female, 62.8%-48.4% (P = 0.002); Male, 82.5%-71.5% (P = 0.003)]. Collectively, these attributes reduced willingness-to-participate from [70.2%-42.2% (P<0.001) overall; 82.5%-58.1% (P<0.001) in men; 62.8%-32.6% (P<0.001) in women]. Among individuals that were unwilling to participate, the commonest barriers were concerns over vaccine safety (54.6%) and fear of catching SARS-CoV-2 (31.6%). Unwillingness to participate was associated with being female (aRR 1.97, CI 1.46-2.67, P<0.001) and having university or other higher-level education (aRR 1.52, CI 1.05-2.2, P = 0.026).

However, it was this epidemic that highlighted this group of viruses and included them among the causative agents of emerging epidemic diseases. In addition, in 2012, another new CoV responsible for the Middle East respiratory syndrome was identified. Both infections were considered a threat to global health security. At present, the third epidemic caused by a CoV is being faced. This new CoV, called 2019-nCoV, was originated in the city of Wuhan, China, and has been linked to severe respiratory infections in humans. Thanks to the collaboration of experts worldwide, more information about this virus and its infection is reported each day, which allows modifying the recommendations for its prevention and treatment, without forgetting that the ultimate goal is to control this epidemic. In this review, the important aspects of this new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, and its disease, COVID-19, have been summarized with the information available up to February 2020.","Sifuentes-Rodríguez, Erika; Palacios-Reyes, Deborah",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,15

Though many approaches have been developed to generate desired structures in polymeric films, few of them can effectively and dynamically achieve periodic porous structures. Here, a facile way is proposed to introduce periodic stratified porous structures into polyelectrolyte films. A photo-crosslinkable polyelectrolyte film of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) and photoreactive poly(acrylic acid) derivative (PAA-N3 ) is prepared by layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly. Stratified crosslinking of the PEI/PAA-N3 film is generated basing on standing-wave optics. The periodic stratified porous structure is constructed by forming pores in noncrosslinked regions in the film. Thanks to the dynamic mobility of polyelectrolytes, this structural controlment can be repeated several times. The size of pores corresponding to the layer spacing of the film contributes to the structural colors. Furthermore, structural color patterns are fabricated in the film by selective photo-crosslinking using photomasks. Although the large-scale structural controlment in thick (micron-scale and above) films needs to be explored further, this work highlights the periodic structural controlment in polymeric films and thus presents an approach for application potentials in sensor, detection, and ink-free printing.","Huang, Wei-Pin; Qian, Hong-Lin; Wang, Jing; Ren, Ke-Feng; Ji, Jian",Adv Sci (Weinh),,15

The aim of this review was to identify the frequency and microbial etiologies of bacterial coinfections that are present upon admission to the hospital and that occur during hospitalization for COVID-19. We found that bacterial coinfections were present in <4% of patients upon admission and the yield of routine diagnostic tests for pneumonia was low. When bacterial coinfections did occur, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were the most common pathogens and atypical bacteria were rare. Although uncommon upon admission, bacterial infections frequently occurred in patients with prolonged hospitalization, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., and S. aureus were common pathogens. Antibacterial therapy and diagnostic testing for bacterial infections are unnecessary upon admission in most patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but clinicians should be vigilant for nosocomial bacterial infections.","Westblade, Lars F; Simon, Matthew S; Satlin, Michael J",Trends microbiol,,15

Methods: The placentas delivered from pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection which were received in the Department of Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology by February 4, 2020 were retrospectively studied. Their clinical material including placental tissue and lung CT, and laboratory results were collected, meanwhile, nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV of the placentas were performed by RT-PCR. Results: Three placentas delivered from pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, who were all in their third trimester with emergency caesarean section. All of the three patients presented with fever (one before caesarean and two in postpartum), and had no significant leukopenia and lymphopenia. Neonatal throat swabs from three newborns were tested for 2019-nCoV, and all samples were negative for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. One premature infant was transferred to Department of Neonatology due to low birth weight. By the end of February 25, 2020, none of the three patients developed severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia or died(two patients had been cured and discharged, while another one had been transferred to a square cabin hospital for isolation treatment). There were various degrees of fibrin deposition inside and around the villi with local syncytial nodule increases in all three placentas. One case of placenta showed the concomitant morphology of chorionic hemangioma and another one with massive placental infarction. No pathological change of villitis and chorioamnionitis was observed in our observation of three cases. All samples from three placentas were negative for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with 2019-nCoV infection in late pregnancy are similar to those of non-pregnant patients, and no severe adverse pregnancy outcome is found in the 3 cases of our observation. Pathological study suggests that there are no morphological changes related to infection in the three placentas. Currently no evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission of 2019-nCoV is found in the three women infected by 2019-nCoV in their late pregnancy.","Chen, S; Huang, B; Luo, D J; Li, X; Yang, F; Zhao, Y; Nie, X; Huang, B X",Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,,15

This study aimed to summarize the evidence and clarify a bundled strategy to reduce burnout of physicians and nurses. METHODS: Researches have been conducted within Cochrane Library, PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, EBSCO, and CINAHL published from inception to 2019. In addition, a manual search for relevant articles was also conducted using Google Scholar and ancestral searches through the reference lists from articles included in the final review. Two reviewers independently selected and assessed, and any disagreements were resolved through a larger team discussion. A data extraction spreadsheet was developed and initially piloted in 3 randomly selected studies. Data from each study were extracted independently using a pre-standardized data abstraction form. The the Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews and assessment of multiple systematic reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool were used to evaluate risk of bias and quality of included articles. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies published from 2014 to 2019 were eligible for analysis. Previous studies have examined burnout among physicians (nâ=â9), nurses (nâ=â6) and healthcare providers (nâ=â7). The MBI was used by majority of studies to assess burnout. The included studies evaluated a wide range of interventions, individual-focused (emotion regulation, self-care workshop, yoga, massage, mindfulness, meditation, stress management skills and communication skills training), structural or organizational (workload or schedule-rotation, stress management training program, group face-to-face delivery, teamwork/transitions, Balint training, debriefing sessions and a focus group) and combine interventions (snoezelen, stress management and resiliency training, stress management workshop and improving interaction with colleagues through personal training). Based on the Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews and AMSTAR 2 criteria, the risk of bias and methodological quality included studies was from moderate to high. CONCLUSIONS: Burnout is a complicated problem and should be dealt with by using bundled strategy. The existing overview clarified evidence to reduce burnout of physicians and nurses, which provided a basis for health policy makers or clinical managers to design simple and feasible strategies to reduce the burnout of physicians and nurses, and to ensure clinical safety.","Zhang, Xiu-Jie; Song, Yingqian; Jiang, Tongtong; Ding, Ning; Shi, Tie-Ying",Medicine (Baltimore),,15

All formulations had probiotic counts higher than 107 CFU/ml during storage and simulated gastrointestinal conditions (SGIC). The prebiotic components increased the probiotic survival to the enteric phase of the SGIC, with inulin producing the most pronounced effect. Inulin addition resulted in products with lower pH values and consistency and higher titratable acidity during storage, with negative impact on the sensory acceptance (flavor, texture, and overall impression) at the end of the storage period. Modified starch addition impacted negatively on the acceptance of the products (appearance, flavor, texture, and overall impression). Polydextrose addition resulted in products with lower consistency, but similar sensory acceptance to the full-fat yogurt. It can be concluded that it is possible to prepare potentially synbiotic Greek yogurts by desorption technique using L. casei as probiotic culture and inulin, polydextrose or modified starch as prebiotic components, with the utilization of polydextrose being advisable.","Dias, Sofia Sestito; de Souza Vergílio, Damarys; Pereira, Arthur Marroni; Klososki, Suellen Jensen; Marcolino, Vanessa Aparecida; da Cruz, Rayane Monique Sete; Costa, Giselle Nobre; Barão, Carlos Eduardo; Pimentel, Tatiana Colombo",J Dairy Res,,15
515231,Modulatory Effects of Caffeine and Pentoxifylline on Aromatic Antibiotics: A Role for Hetero-Complex Formation,2021,"Vaccination represents the best line of defense against infectious diseases and is crucial in curtailing pandemic spread of emerging pathogens to which a population has limited immunity. In recent years, mRNA vaccines have been proposed as the new frontier in vaccination, owing to their facile and rapid development while providing a safer alternative to traditional vaccine technologies such as live or attenuated viruses. Recent breakthroughs in mRNA vaccination have been through formulation with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which provide both protection and enhanced delivery of mRNA vaccines in vivo. In this review, current paradigms and state-of-the-art in mRNA-LNP vaccine development are explored through first highlighting advantages posed by mRNA vaccines, establishing LNPs as a biocompatible delivery system, and finally exploring the use of mRNA-LNP vaccines in vivo against infectious disease towards translation to the clinic. Furthermore, we highlight the progress of mRNA-LNP vaccine candidates against COVID-19 currently in clinical trials, with the current status and approval timelines, before discussing their future outlook and challenges that need to be overcome towards establishing mRNA-LNPs as next-generation vaccines. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: With the recent success of mRNA vaccines developed by Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer against COVID-19, mRNA technology and lipid nanoparticles (LNP) have never received more attention. This manuscript timely reviews the most advanced mRNA-LNP vaccines that have just been approved for emergency use and are in clinical trials, with a focus on the remarkable development of several COVID-19 vaccines, faster than any other vaccine in history. We aim to give a comprehensive introduction of mRNA and LNP technology to the field of biomaterials science and increase accessibility to readers with a new interest in mRNA-LNP vaccines. We also highlight current limitations and future outlook of the mRNA vaccine technology that need further efforts of biomaterials scientists to address.","Pilkington, Emily H; Suys, Estelle J A; Trevaskis, Natalie L; Wheatley, Adam K; Zukancic, Danijela; Algarni, Azizah; Al-Wassiti, Hareth; Davis, Thomas P; Pouton, Colin W; Kent, Stephen J; Truong, Nghia P",Acta biomater,,15

During the following weeks, at 2 Dutch teaching hospitals, 9 health care workers (HCWs) received a diagnosis of COVID-19, 8 of whom had no history of travel to China or northern Italy, raising the question of whether undetected community circulation was occurring. Objective: To determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was performed in 2 teaching hospitals in the southern part of the Netherlands in March 2020, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care workers employed in the participating hospitals who experienced fever or respiratory symptoms were asked to voluntarily participate in a screening for infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Data analysis was performed in March 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was determined by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on oropharyngeal samples. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. Results: Of 9705 HCWs employed (1722 male [18%]), 1353 (14%) reported fever or respiratory symptoms and were tested. Of those, 86 HCWs (6%) were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (median age, 49 years [range, 22-66 years]; 15 [17%] male), representing 1% of all HCWs employed. Most HCWs experienced mild disease, and only 46 (53%) reported fever. Eighty HCWs (93%) met a case definition of fever and/or coughing and/or shortness of breath. Only 3 (3%) of the HCWs identified through the screening had a history of travel to China or northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported having been exposed to an inpatient with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 before the onset of symptoms. Conclusions and Relevance: Within 2 weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, likely as a result of acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread. The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, suggests that the currently recommended case definition for suspected COVID-19 should be used less stringently.","Kluytmans-van den Bergh, Marjolein F Q; Buiting, Anton G M; Pas, Suzan D; Bentvelsen, Robbert G; van den Bijllaardt, Wouter; van Oudheusden, Anne J G; van Rijen, Miranda M L; Verweij, Jaco J; Koopmans, Marion P G; Kluytmans, Jan A J W",JAMA Netw Open,,15

518144,Animal Coronaviruses Induced Apoptosis,2021,"Timely and precise identification of COVID19 is an arduous task due to the shortage and the inefficiency of the medical test kits. As a result of which medical professionals have turned their attention towards radiological images like Computed Tomography (CT) scans. There have been continued attempts on creating deep learning models to detect COVID-19 using CT scans. This has certainly reduced the manual intervention in disease detection but the reported detection accuracy is limited. Motivated by this, in the present work, an automatic system for COVID-19 diagnosis is proposed using a concatenation of the Mobilenetv2 and ResNet50 features. Typically, the features from the last convolution layer of the transfer learned Mobilenetv2, and the last average pooling layer of the learned ResNet50 are fused to improve the classification accuracy. The fused feature vector along with the corresponding labels is used to train an SVM classifier to give the output. The proposed technique is validated on the benchmark COVID CT dataset comprising of a total of 2482 images with 1252 positive and 1230 negative cases. The experimental results reveal that the proposed feature fusion strategy achieves a validation accuracy of 98.35%, F1-score of 98.39%, the precision of 99.19%, and a recall of 97.60% for detecting COVID-19 cases with 80% training and 20% validation scheme.

In this study, we assessed the association between changes in dietary and lifestyle habits and body weight, and the benefits of receiving weight management care remotely through telemedicine during lockdown. Compared to patients not receiving obesity care via telemedicine, patients receiving this care were more likely to lose weight (OR, 2.79; p = 0.042) and also to increase participation in exercise (OR, 2.4; p = 0.022). While 40% of respondents reported consuming more sweet or salty processed snacks and 33% reported less vegetables and fruits, 65% reported more homemade foods. At the same time, 40% of respondents reported a reduction in exercise and 52% reported a decline in mood. Alterations in these eating patterns, as well as in exercise habits and mood, were significantly associated with weight changes. This study highlights that lockdown affects health behaviors associated with weight change, and advocates for the use of telemedicine to provide ongoing obesity care during future quarantines in order to promote weight loss and prevent weight gain.","Minsky, Noga C; Pachter, Dafna; Zacay, Galia; Chishlevitz, Naama; Ben-Hamo, Miriam; Weiner, Dana; Segal-Lieberman, Gabriella",Nutrients,,15

Only limited data are available on the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in France. AIMS: To investigate the characteristics, cardiovascular complications and outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in France. METHODS: The Critical COVID-19 France (CCF) study is a French nationwide study including all consecutive adults with a diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection hospitalized in 24 centres between 26 February and 20 April 2020. Patients admitted directly to intensive care were excluded. Clinical, biological and imaging parameters were systematically collected at hospital admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. RESULTS: Of 2878 patients included (mean±SD age 66.6±17.0 years, 57.8% men), 360 (12.5%) died in the hospital setting, of which 7 (20.7%) were transferred to intensive care before death.

590101,Bioavailability of Orally Administered Active Lipid Compounds from four Different Greenshell™ Mussel Formats,2020-10-23,"Background Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist, has been used in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as an anti-cytokine agent. IL-6 also plays a complex role in hemostasis and thrombosis. We observed a transient elevation of D-dimer in our patients who received tocilizumab, which triggered this study. Methods A retrospective hospital-based cohort analysis of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who received tocilizumab during the study period of March 15, 2020, to May 20, 2020, was conducted. We retrieved demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, and patients who were receiving therapeutic anticoagulation therapy prior to tocilizumab administration were excluded. Descriptive analysis was performed, and the cause of death and trends of D-dimer and inflammatory markers were studied. Results Out of the 436 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted during the study period, 24 met the inclusion criteria. Their median age was 47.5 years. They were 18 males and 6 females; 15 patients survived and nine expired. Of the group that survived, 12 received therapeutic anticoagulation. Of the seven patients who did not receive therapeutic anticoagulation, four expired (one from sepsis and three probably from thromboembolic complications) compared to five deaths in the 17 patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation (four from sepsis and one possibly from thromboembolic complications). Conclusions The interplay between IL-6, IL-6 receptor antagonist, and venous thromboembolism is complex. We observed a transient elevation of D-dimer in COVID-19 patients who received tocilizumab, and a trend toward increased death secondary to thromboembolism. This observation is novel and highlights the potential thrombophilic side effects of tocilizumab.","Chan, Kok Hoe; Patel, Bhavik; Podel, Bishnu; Szablea, Maria E; Shaaban, Hamid S; Guron, Gunwant; Slim, Jihad",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.15208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34178527/,15

591342,Immunogenic properties of immunoglobulin superfamily members within complex biological networks,2020-10-11,"Summary The cutaneous application of different doses of viable Trichophyton verrueosum to the unabraded skin of cattle of various ages resulted in clinically recognizable ringworm infection of varying extent and duration. Confluent lesions covering the whole inoculated area were produced by 107 viable units of the fungus, whereas the minimal infective dose of 103 viable units produced limited areas of infection only. The level of nutrition within the limits imposed had no effect on the extent or severity of lesions. The fungus was found to invade the keratinized portions of skin and hair of cattle of all ages at the same rate. However, both the cutaneous inflammatory response and the resolution of lesions were most rapid in older animals. The ability to eliminate infection more rapidly was associated with a marked delayed hypersensitivity response commencing 14 days after infection. Such hypersensitivity was not detectable by this means after the resolution of lesions. T. verrueosum could not be isolated in culture from skin lesions until 21 days after inoculation and could only be isolated for half the period that lesions were present. Cattle were resistant to cutaneous reinfection with viable T. verrueosum on previously infected or fresh skin sites at 2 months and at more than one year after the resolution of primary lesions. A mild delayed hypersensitivity response developed in every site within 48 hr. of reinoculation. The intravenous inoculation of previously-infected cattle with 104 viable units of T. verrueosum resulted in an immediate-type cutaneous reaction at the original site of infection.","Lepper, A.W.D.",Research in Veterinary Science,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528818340542; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528818340542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5036310/,15

We performed a retrospective review of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the ProMedica Health System in Northwest Ohio from March 25 to June 16, 2020. The study aims to identify epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and predictors of Mortality of COVID-19 patients in Northwest Ohio. Methods This study was conducted on 217 COVID-19 patients admitted to ProMedica Health System Hospitals in Northwest Ohio from March 25 to June 16, 2020. We collected data, including clinical signs, symptoms, and outcomes of the COVID-19 patients. We compared clinical signs and symptoms along with comorbidities of survivors and non-survivors. Results Of the 217 patients included in the study, the mean age of the population was 63.13 (SD 17.8), of which 194 (89.4%, mean age 61.7 years) survived while 23 (10.6%, mean age 74.6 years) died. Among them, 53% were females and 47% male. Common presenting symptoms were chest pain (91.71%), shortness of breath (79.7%), cough (71%), and fever (64%). Mortality was associated with age greater than 63 (p-value 0.0052) and hypertension (p-value: 0.0058) with marginal significance with gender (p-value: 0.0642), chest pain (p-value: 0.0944), and history of cancer (p-value: 0.0944). Conclusions Advanced age and hypertension (HTN) are independent predictors for increased mortality. History of cancer and chest pain are associated with increased mortality with marginal significance. Awareness among physicians about predictors of mortality is essential in dealing with COVID-19 patients. It is essential to educate the public about preventative strategies such as wearing masks to decrease mortality and morbidity from this pandemic.","Balla, Mamtha; Merugu, Ganesh; Nesheiwat, Zeid; Patel, Mitra; Sheikh, Taha; Fatima, Rawish; Kotturi, Vinay K; Bommana, Venugopal; Pulagam, Gautham; Kaminski, Brian",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079643/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14308,15

Although previous studies have identified various potential stressors crisis line volunteers face, as yet a comprehensive assessment is lacking with regards to the frequency and perceived stressfulness of work- and organization-related demands, and their relationship with distress and a volunteer's intention to leave. Objective: To identify the frequency and impact of particular stressful situations (demands). In addition, to examine the extent to which these demands are associated with volunteers' demographics, distress and intention to leave the crisis line service. Method: In a cross-sectional study among 543 volunteers of a Dutch crisis line service the participants filled out a questionnaire about their experience of a large number of work- and organization-related demands and their perceived stressfulness. To calculate the impact of demands, the occurrence and stressfulness were multiplied. In addition, work-related distress, intention to leave the crisis line service as well as a number of demographics and work-related characteristics were assessed. Results: Work-related demands with the highest impact on volunteers were calls from people with psychiatric problems and suicidal intentions. “Having no time for a break” was the organization-related demand with the highest impact on volunteers. Eighteen percentage of the volunteers scored moderate or high on distress and 4% had the intention to leave the crisis line service within 1 year. Most work- and organization-related demands were positively associated with volunteers' distress and intention to leave the organization. Being older, being male and spending more hours per week volunteering were significantly, positively correlated with work-related demands. The total explained variance for distress was 16% and for intention to leave 13%. Conclusion: Although most crisis line volunteers experienced low impact from work- and organization-related demands, these demands were significantly related to experienced distress and the intention to leave crisis line service. For volunteers with moderate to high distress it can be useful to implement interventions aimed at increasing personal resources to help them deal with the challenges of the work at the crisis line.","Willems, Renate C.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained data from 40 hospitals around China that employed DBS tele‐programming for their outpatients with Parkinson's disease or dystonia from January 2019 to March 2020. Data were obtained on the number and nature of patients' DBS health care service requests, reasons for their requests, the number of DBS telemedicine sessions subsequently completed, safety issues, and the patients' satisfaction with the DBS tele‐programing parameter adjustments made. RESULTS: There were 909 DBS tele‐programming health service requests (from 196 patients) completed during the study period. The results showed: 1) the number of DBS telemedicine sessions requested and the number of patients examined increased during the COVID‐19 outbreak in February and March 2020 when compared with the monthly numbers in 2019; 2) the most common reason for the patients' health service requests was poor symptom control; 3) the most common DBS tele‐programming adjustment made was voltage change; 4) overall, most (89%) DBS tele‐programming adjustment sessions were experienced by the patients as satisfactory; and 5) significant adverse events and unexpected treatment interruptions caused by connection failure or other hardware‐ or software‐related problems did not occur. CONCLUSIONS: DBS telemedicine could have a unique role to play in maintaining the delivery of DBS treatment and medical care to outpatients with movement disorders during the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Zhang, Chencheng; Zhu, Kaiwen; Lin, Zhengyu; Huang, Peng; Pan, Yixin; Sun, Bomin; Li, Dianyou",Neuromodulation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006811/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ner.13274,15

Essential Oil Using Macroporous Resin Followed by Microemulsion Encapsulation to Improve Its Safety and Antiviral Activity,2017-02-15,"Extended community testing constitutes one of the main strategic pillars in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome on nasopharyngeal swab samples is currently the reference test. While displaying excellent analytical sensitivity and specificity, this test is costly, often requires a substantial turnaround time, and, more importantly, is subject to reagent and other material shortages. To complement this technology, rapid antigen tests have been developed and made available worldwide, allowing cheap, quick, and decentralized SARS-CoV-2 testing. The main drawback of these tests is the reduced sensitivity when RT-PCR is the gold standard. In this study, we evaluate Visby an innovative, portable, easy-to-use RT-PCR point-of-care (POC) diagnostic device. Our retrospective analysis shows that overall, compared to the Cobas 6800 RT-qPCR assay (Roche), this RT-PCR POC technology detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA with 95% sensitivity (95%CI = 86.3–99%) and 100% specificity (95% CI = 80.5–100%). For samples with cycle-threshold values below 31, we observed 100% sensitivity (95% CI = 66.4–100%). While showing an analytical sensitivity slightly below that of a standard RT-qPCR system, the evaluated Visby RT-PCR POC device may prove to be an interesting diagnostic alternative in the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially combining the practical advantages of rapid antigen tests and the robust analytical performances of nucleic acid detection systems.","Renzoni, Adriana; Perez, Francisco; Ngo Nsoga, Marie Thérèse; Yerly, Sabine; Boehm, Erik; Gayet-Ageron, Angèle; Kaiser, Laurent; Schibler, Manuel",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947153/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11050813,15

Like in those illnesses, the lung injury and acute respiratory distress shown in COVID‐19 patients are the result of a disruption in the balance of pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory cytokines. This hyperinflammatory response to SARS‐CoV‐2, associated with the severity of the coronavirus disease, is called the cytokine storm. There is a growing concern regarding how patients on immunosuppressant biologic therapies might be at higher risk of being infected and whether they need to discontinue their treatment preemptively. Clinical data on COVID‐19 infected patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis are still scarce. Here, we presented seven cases of this type of patients. The patient infected with COVID‐19 on apremilast and the one on apremilast with infected spouse showed the best safety profile and mildest symptoms. One of the secukinumab patients also presented a relatively good outcome. Infliximab patients and the one with serious comorbidities showed the worst outcome.

Actual experimental therapies are trying to reduce the activation of some specific cytokines, such as IL-6, somewhat reducing the burden for the patient. However, they are often unable to block the whole storm occurring at the cytokine level. In presence of the cytokine storm, especially in severe patients, antagomiRs, already demonstrated to be efficient and secure in cardiovascular disease, could represent a useful alternative to such treatment, customizable upon the disease specificities and applicable to other coronaviruses possibly associated with such clinical manifestations, while a reliable, efficient vaccine is being distributed.","Gangemi, Sebastiano; Tonacci, Alessandro",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610120302045?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2020.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32938545/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359610120302045,15
594252,Nanoparticle-Based Peptide Vaccines,2016-10-07,"BACKGROUND: There is a strong policy impetus for the One Health cross-sectoral approach to address the complex challenge of zoonotic diseases, particularly in low/lower middle income countries (LMICs). Yet the implementation of this approach in LMIC contexts such as India has proven challenging, due partly to the relatively limited practical guidance and understanding on how to foster and sustain cross-sector collaborations. This study addresses this gap by exploring the facilitators of and barriers to successful convergence between the human, animal and environmental health sectors in India. METHODS: A mixed methods study was conducted using a detailed content review of national policy documents and in-depth semi-structured interview data on zoonotic disease management in India. In total, 29 policy documents were reviewed and 15 key informant interviews were undertaken with national and state level policymakers, disease managers and experts operating within the human-animal-environment interface of zoonotic disease control. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that there is limited policy visibility of zoonotic diseases, although global zoonoses, especially those identified to be of pandemic potential by international organisations (e.g. CDC, WHO and OIE) rather than local, high burden endemic diseases, have high recognition in the existing policy agenda setting. Despite the widespread acknowledgement of the importance of cross-sectoral collaboration, a myriad of factors operated to either constrain or facilitate the success of cross-sectoral convergence at different stages (i.e. information-sharing, undertaking common activities and merging resources and infrastructure) of cross-sectoral action. Importantly, participants identified the lack of supportive policies, conflicting departmental priorities and limited institutional capacities as major barriers that hamper effective cross-sectoral collaboration on zoonotic disease control. Building on existing informal inter-personal relationships and collaboration platforms were suggested by participants as the way forward. CONCLUSION: Our findings point to the importance of strengthening existing national policy frameworks as a first step for leveraging cross-sectoral capacity for improved disease surveillance and interventions. This requires the contextual adaptation of the One Health approach in a manner that is sensitive to the underlying socio-political, institutional and cultural context that determines and shapes outcomes of cross-sector collaborative arrangements.

595575,Emerging viruses set to soar,2003-12-15,"In order to understand the spatio-temporal structure of epidemics beyond that permitted with classical SIR (susceptible-infective-recovered)-type models, a new mathematical model for the spread of a viral disease in a population of spatially distributed hosts is described. The positions of the hosts are randomly generated in a rectangular habitat. Encounters between any pair of individuals are according to a Poisson process with a mean rate that declines exponentially as the distance between them increases. The contact rate allows the mean rates to be set at a certain number of encounters per day on average. The relevant state variables for each individual at any time are given by the solution of a pair of coupled differential equations for the viral load and the quantity of general immune system effectors which reduce the viral load. The parameters describing within-host viral-immune system dynamics are generated randomly to reflect variability across a population. Transmission is assumed to depend on the viral loads in donors and occurs with a probability [Formula: see text]. The initial conditions are such that one randomly chosen individual carries a randomly chosen amount of the virus, whereas the rest of the population is uninfected. Simulations reveal local or whole-population responses. Whole-population disease spread may be in the form of isolated or multiple occurrences, the latter often being approximately periodic. The mechanisms of this oscillatory behaviour are analyzed in terms of several parameters and the distribution of critical points in the host dynamical systems. Increased contact rate, increased probability of transmission and decreased threshold for viral transmission, decreased immune strength and increased viral growth rate all increase the probability of multiple outbreaks and the distribution of the critical points also plays a role.","Tuckwell, Henry C.; Toubiana, Laurent",Biosystems,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303264706002929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17324498/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264706002929,15

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: A study was conducted to compare an intravenous (IV) gravimetric technology–assisted workflow (TAWF) platform to an IV robotic system. In the study we reviewed both IV technology platforms using the same gravimetric quality assurance system, which allowed for direct comparison. METHODS: All oncology preparations compounded from January 2016 through December 2018 using either system were included in our retrospective analysis. Final preparation accuracy, IV system precision, and workflow throughput (analyzed using lean process methodologies) were evaluated. RESULTS: Data analysis indicated that use of the IV gravimetric TAWF system was associated with a significantly lower percentage of accuracy errors compared to the IV robotics system (1.58% vs 2.47%, P < 0.001), with no significant difference in absolute precision (1.12 vs 1.12 P = 0.952). Lean analysis demonstrated that overall completion time (17:49 minutes vs 24:45 minutes) and compound preparation time (2:39 minutes vs 6:07 minutes) were less with the IV gravimetric TAWF vs the IV robotics system. CONCLUSION: Implementation of either an IV gravimetric TAWF system or IV robotics system will result in similar compounding accuracy and precision. Preparation time was less with use of the IV gravimetric TAWF vs the IV robotic system, but the IV robotic system required less human intervention. Both systems ensure medication safety for patients, although the IV robotic system has increased safeguards in place. Therefore, the primary driver for implementing these systems is alternative factors such as cost of systems implementation and maintenance, employee safety, and drug waste.","Pang, Bob; Earl, Marc; Knoer, Scott; Yaniv, Angela; Willner, Marc; Boyd, Anthony",Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxaa366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33064792/,15

METHODS: This multicenter observational cohort study will enroll at least 600 patients <21 years old who meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition of MIS-C across multiple North American centers over 2 years. The study will collect detailed hospital and follow-up data for up to 5 years, and optional genetic testing. Cardiac imaging at specific time points includes standardized echocardiographic assessment (all participants) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in those with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <45% during the acute illness. The primary outcomes are the worst LVEF and the highest coronary artery z-score of the left anterior descending or right coronary artery. Other outcomes include occurrence and course of non-cardiac organ dysfunction, inflammation, and major medical events. Independent adjudication of cases will classify participants as definite, possible, or not MIS-C. Analysis of the outcomes will include descriptive statistics and regression analysis with stratification by definite or possible MIS-C. The MUSIC study will provide phenotypic data to support basic and translational research studies. CONCLUSIONS: The MUSIC study, with the largest cohort of MIS-C patients and the longest follow-up period to date, will make an important contribution to our understanding of the acute cardiac and non-cardiac manifestations of MIS-C and the long-term effects of this public health emergency.","Truong, Dongngan T; Trachtenberg, Felicia L; Pearson, Gail D; Dionne, Audrey; Elias, Matthew D; Friedman, Kevin; Hayes, Kerri H; Mahony, Lynn; McCrindle, Brian W; Oster, Matthew E; Pemberton, Victoria; Powell, Andrew J; Russell, Mark W; Shekerdemian, Lara S; Son, Mary Beth; Taylor, Michael; Newburger, Jane W",Am. heart j,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2021.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34418362/,15
597258,Advances in Vaccine Development,2021-09-18,"Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) is a common medical condition affecting up to 80% of the general population. Clinical manifestations can range from mild to more severe signs and symptoms that contribute to the impairment of the quality of life (QoL) of affected patients. Among treatment options, venoactive drugs such as diosmin are widely used in the symptomatic treatment in all clinical stages. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a new formulated diosmin in relieving symptoms and improving QoL in patients suffering from CVD. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical study, CVD patients with a Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification system between C2 and C4 were randomized to receive a bioavailable diosmin (as μsmin(®) Plus) 450 mg tablet once daily or a placebo for 8 weeks. Clinical symptoms and QoL were monitored using the measurement of leg circumference, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, Global Index Score (GIS) and Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). A total of 72 subjects completed the study. From week 4, leg edema was significantly decreased in the active group (p < 0.001). An improvement in the VAS score was observed in the active group compared to placebo at the end of treatment (p < 0.05). GIS and VCSS scores were significantly improved in the active group at week 8 (p < 0.001). No treatment related-side effects were recorded. The results of this study showed that the administration of low-dose μsmin(®) Plus was safe and effective in relieving symptoms and improving QoL in subjects with CVD.","Serra, Raffaele; Ielapi, Nicola; Bitonti, Andrea; Candido, Stefano; Fregola, Salvatore; Gallo, Alessandro; Loria, Antonio; Muraca, Lucia; Raimondo, Luca; Velcean, Luminița; Guadagna, Simone; Gallelli, Luca",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808784/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13030999,15
597367,Genetic code expansion strategies for vaccine development,2020-06-30,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced health-care providers to find creative ways to allow continuity of care in times of lockdown. Telemedicine enables provision of care when in-person visits are not possible. Sheba Medical Center made a rapid transition of outpatient clinics to video consultations (VC) during the first wave of COVID-19 in Israel. OBJECTIVE: Results of a survey of patient and clinician user experience with VC are reported. METHODS: Satisfaction surveys were sent by text messages to patients, clinicians who practice VC (users) and clinicians who do not practice VC (non-users). Questions referred to general satisfaction, ease of use, technical issues and medical and communication quality. Questions and scales were based on surveys used regularly in outpatient clinics of Sheba Medical Center. RESULTS: More than 1200 clinicians (physicians, psychologists, nurses, social workers, dietitians, speech therapists, genetic consultants and others) provided VC during the study period. Five hundred and forty patients, 162 clinicians who were users and 50 clinicians who were non-users completed the survey. High level of satisfaction was reported by 89.8% of patients and 37.7% of clinician users. Technical problems were experienced by 21% of patients and 80% of clinician users. Almost 70% of patients but only 23.5% of clinicians found the platform very simple to use. Over 90% of patients were very satisfied with clinician’s courtesy, expressed a high sense of trust, thought that clinician’s explanations and recommendations were clear and estimated that the clinician understood their problems and 86.5% of them would recommend VC to family and friends. Eighty-seven percent of clinician users recognize the benefit of VC for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic but only 68% supported continuation of the service after the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our study reports high levels of patient satisfaction from outpatient clinics VC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower levels of clinician satisfaction can mostly be attributed to technical and administrative challenges related to the newly implemented telemedicine platform. Our findings support the continued future use of VC as a means of providing patient-centered care. Future steps need to be taken to continuously improve the clinical and administrative application of telemedicine services.","BARKAI, Galia; GADOT, Moran; AMIR, Hadar; MENASHE, Michal; SHVIMER-ROTHSCHILD, Lilach; ZIMLICHMAN, Eyal",Int J Qual Health Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33313891/; https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzaa165,15

598826,Application of chicken egg yolk immunoglobulins in the control of terrestrial and aquatic animal diseases: A review,2011-07-20,"Introduction and objectives: COVID-19 is currently causing high mortality and morbidity worldwide. Information on cardiac injury is scarce. We aimed to evaluate cardiovascular damage in patients with COVID-19 and determine the correlation of high-sensitivity cardiac-specific troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) with the severity of COVID-19. Methods: We included 872 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 from February to April 2020. We tested 651 patients for high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and 506 for NT-proBNP on admission. Cardiac injury was defined as hs-TnT > 14ng/L, the upper 99th percentile. Levels of NT-proBNP > 300 pg/mL were considered related to some extent of cardiac injury. The primary composite endpoint was 30-day mortality or mechanical ventilation (MV). Results: Cardiac injury by hs-TnT was observed in 34.6% of our COVID-19 patients. Mortality or MV were higher in cardiac injury than noncardiac injury patients (39.1% vs 9.1%). Hs-TnT and NT-proBNP levels were independent predictors of death or MV (HR, 2.18; 95%CI, 1.23-3.83 and 1.87 (95%CI, 1.05-3.36), respectively) and of mortality alone (HR, 2.91; 95%CI, 1.211-7.04 and 5.47; 95%CI, 2.10-14.26, respectively). NT-ProBNP significantly improved the troponin model discrimination of mortality or MV (C-index 0.83 to 0.84), and of mortality alone (C-index 0.85 to 0.87). Conclusions: Myocardial injury measured at admission was a common finding in patients with COVID-19. It reliably predicted the occurrence of mortality and need of MV, the most severe complications of the disease. NT-proBNP improved the prognostic accuracy of hs-TnT.","Calvo-Fernández, Alicia; Izquierdo, Andrea; Subirana, Isaac; Farré, Nuria; Vila, Joan; Durán, Xavier; García-Guimaraes, Marcos; Valdivielso, Sandra; Cabero, Paula; Soler, Cristina; García-Ribas, Cora; Rodríguez, Clara; Llagostera, Marc; Mojón, Diana; Vicente, Miren; Solé-González, Eduard; Sánchez-Carpintero, Andrea; Tevar, Cristina; Marrugat, Jaume; Vaquerizo, Beatriz",Rev Esp Cardiol (Engl Ed),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33153955/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rec.2020.09.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S188558572030414X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S188558572030414X?v=s5,15

However, certain diseases can overstimulate its potential to self-heal and cause excessive cellular matrix and collagen buildup. Decompensation of liver fibrosis leads to cirrhosis, a buildup of fibrotic ECM that impedes the liver’s ability to efficiently exchange fluid. This review summarizes the complex immunological activities in different liver diseases, and how failure to maintain liver homeostasis leads to progressive fibrotic tissue development. We also discuss a variety of pathologies that lead to liver cirrhosis, such as alcoholic liver disease and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV). Mesenchymal stem cells are widely studied for their potential in tissue replacement and engineering. Herein, we discuss the potential of MSCs to regulate immune response and alter the disease state. Substantial efforts have been performed in preclinical animal testing, showing promising results following inhibition of host immunity.

600412,Silver Nanoparticles: Mechanism of Action and Probable Bio-Application,2020-11-26,"COVID-19 pandemic has brought uncertainty in educational response, skilling methods, and training practices among teachers and institutions. Even before the pandemic shutdowns, the incorporation of virtual laboratories within classroom education had brought transformations in teaching laboratory courses. Virtual laboratories were integrated as training platforms for complementing learning objectives in laboratory education especially during this pandemic imposed shutdown. In context of suspended face-to-face teaching, this study explores the role of virtual laboratories as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in ensuring the continuity of teaching–learning, providing alternative ways for skill training from home. As an innovative approach, the study presents push–pull mooring theory to analyze switching intention of users from offline conventional education to online education. The study explores the complements of physical experiments brought in with animations, simulations, and remote laboratory set-ups for providing skill trainings to learners. To test whether virtualization techniques have global impact in education sector, the study included a comparative analysis of student users during the academic year 2019 (before-COVID) who had a blended approach of learning and those of the year 2020 (post-COVID), with remote learning. Initial before-COVID behavioral analysis on university students (n = 1059) indicated the substantial popularity of virtual laboratories in education for skill training and instructor dependency. Usage adoption of virtual laboratories increased during the pandemic-imposed lockdowns and learners were being less instructor dependent. 24% of students accessed more 10 times a week without the instructor being present and overall, 90% contributed to a minimum of 5 usages a week. In terms of Kolb’s learning styles, most of the virtual laboratory learners were assimilators. The results suggest virtual laboratories may have a prominent role in inquiry based and self-guided education with minimum instructor dependency, which may be crucial for complementing practice skills and planning online tools to add to this post-COVID-19 teaching and learning scenarios.","Radhamani, Rakhi; Kumar, Dhanush; Nizar, Nijin; Achuthan, Krishnashree; Nair, Bipin; Diwakar, Shyam",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121909/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10583-3,15

Here, we utilize the Collaborative Cross (CC), a mouse genetic reference population, to study genetic regulation of variation in antibody response following IAV infection. CC mice show significant heritable variation in the magnitude, kinetics, and composition of IAV-specific antibody response. We map 23 genetic loci associated with this variation. Analysis of a subset of these loci finds that they broadly affect the antibody response to IAV as well as other viruses. Candidate genes are identified based on predicted variant consequences and haplotype-specific expression patterns, and several show overlap with genes identified in human mapping studies. These findings demonstrate that the host antibody response to IAV infection is under complex genetic control and highlight the utility of the CC in modeling and identifying genetic factors with translational relevance to human health and disease.","Noll, Kelsey E.; Whitmore, Alan C.; West, Ande; McCarthy, Mary K.; Morrison, Clayton R.; Plante, Kenneth S.; Hampton, Brea K.; Kollmus, Heike; Pilzner, Carolin; Leist, Sarah R.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Schäfer, Alexandra; Miller, Darla; Shaw, Ginger; Mooney, Michael; McWeeney, Shannon; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando; Schughart, Klaus; Morrison, Thomas E.; Baric, Ralph S.; Ferris, Martin T.; Heise, Mark T.",Cell Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720305362; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32348764/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124720305362,15

METHODS: A comparison (groups 1 versus 2) and subgroup analysis were performed between patients’ demographic, medical history, surgical, clinical and management characteristics. RESULTS: Two-hundred forty-six patients were included, 137 in group 1 and 109 in group 2 (p = 0.03). No significant differences were observed in the peri-operative characteristics of the two groups. A declared delay in access to hospital and preoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were 15.5% and 5.8%, respectively in group 2. The overall morbidity (OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.08–4.55, p = 0.03) and 30-day mortality (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.33–5.50, =0.68) were significantly higher in group 2. The delayed access cohort showed a close correlation with increased morbidity (OR = 3.19, 95% CI 0.89–11.44, p = 0.07), blood transfusion (OR = 5.13, 95% CI 1.05–25.15, p = 0.04) and 30-day mortality risk (OR = 8.00, 95% CI 1.01–63.23, p = 0.05). SARS-CoV-2-positive patients had higher risk of blood transfusion (20% vs 7.8%, p = 0.37) and ICU admissions (20% vs 2.6%, p = 0.17) and a longer median LOS (9 days vs 4 days, p = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: This article provides enhanced understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient access to emergency surgical care.

Early reports indicate possible neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe, highly variable prevalence rates, and uncertainty regarding causal or coincidental occurrence of symptoms. As neurological involvement of any systemic disease is frequently associated with adverse effects on morbidity and mortality, obtaining accurate and consistent global data on the extent to which COVID-19 may impact the nervous system is urgently needed. To address this need, investigators from the Neurocritical Care Society launched the Global Consortium Study of Neurological Dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID). The GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium rapidly implemented a Tier 1, pragmatic study to establish phenotypes and prevalence of neurological manifestations of COVID-19. A key component of this global collaboration is development and application of common data elements (CDEs) and definitions to facilitate rigorous and systematic data collection across resource settings. Integration of these elements is critical to reduce heterogeneity of data and allow for future high-quality meta-analyses. The GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium specifically designed these elements to be feasible for clinician investigators during a global pandemic when healthcare systems are likely overwhelmed and resources for research may be limited. Elements include pediatric components and translated versions to facilitate collaboration and data capture in Latin America, one of the epicenters of this global outbreak. In this manuscript, we share the specific data elements, definitions, and rationale for the adult and pediatric CDEs for Tier 1 of the GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium, as well as the translated versions adapted for use in Latin America. Global efforts are underway to further harmonize CDEs with other large consortia studying neurological and general aspects of COVID-19 infections.

This included problems with the length of the original genotyping protocol, unavailability of reagents, and sample degradation and storage. Despite this, three different library preparation methods for Illumina sequencing were set up, and the hands-on library preparation time was decreased from twelve to three hours, which enabled the outbreak investigation to be completed in just a few weeks. Furthermore, the new protocols increased the success rate of sequencing whole viral genomes. A simple bioinformatics workflow for the assembly of high-quality genomes in near-real time was also fine-tuned.

A subsequent increase in community prevalence of infection could delay further relaxation of lockdown if vaccine uptake and efficacy are not sufficiently high to prevent increased pressure on healthcare services. Methods The PCR self-swab arm of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission Study (REACT-1) estimates community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England based on random cross-sections of the population ages five and over. Here, we present results from the complete round 9 of REACT-1 comprising round 9a in which swabs were collected from 4th to 12th February 2021 and round 9b from 13th to 23rd February 2021. We also compare the results of REACT-1 round 9 to round 8, in which swabs were collected mainly from 6th January to 22nd January 2021. Results Out of 165,456 results for round 9 overall, 689 were positive. Overall weighted prevalence of infection in the community in England was 0.49% (0.44%, 0.55%), representing a fall of over two thirds from round 8. However the rate of decline of the epidemic has slowed from 15 (13, 17) days, estimated for the period from the end of round 8 to the start of round 9, to 31 days estimated using data from round 9 alone (lower confidence limit 17 days). When comparing round 9a to 9b there were apparent falls in four regions, no apparent change in one region and apparent rises in four regions, including London where there was a suggestion of sub-regional heterogeneity in growth and decline. Smoothed prevalence maps suggest large contiguous areas of growth and decline that do not align with administrative regions. Prevalence fell by 50% or more across all age groups in round 9 compared to round 8, with prevalence (round 9) ranging from 0.21% in those aged 65 and over to 0.71% in those aged 13 to 17 years. Round 9 prevalence was highest among Pakistani participants at 2.1% compared to white participants at 0.45% and Black participants at 0.83%. There were higher adjusted odds of infection for healthcare and care home workers, for those working in public transport and those working in education, school, nursery or childcare and lower adjusted odds for those not required to work outside the home. Conclusions Community prevalence of swab-positivity has declined markedly between January and February 2021 during lockdown in England, but remains high; the rate of decline has slowed in the most recent period, with a suggestion of pockets of growth. Continued adherence to social distancing and public health measures is required so that infection rates fall to much lower levels. This will help to ensure that the benefits of the vaccination roll-out programme in England are fully realised.","Riley, S.; Walters, C. E.; Wang, H.; Eales, O.; Haw, D.; Ainslie, K. E.

604393,Local Toxicity of Biocides after Direct and Aerosol Exposure on the Human Skin Epidermis and Airway Tissue Models,2021-02-03,"To respond to the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, this contribution deals with recently highlighted COVID-19 transmission through respiratory droplets in form of aerosols. Unlike other recent studies that focused on airborne transmission routes, this work addresses aerosol transport and deposition in a human respiratory tract. The contribution therefore conducts a computational study of aerosol deposition in digital replicas of human airways, which include the oral cavity, larynx and tracheobronchial airways down to the 12th generation of branching. Breathing through the oral cavity allows the air with aerosols to directly impact the larynx and tracheobronchial airways and can be viewed as one of the worst cases in terms of inhalation rate and aerosol load. The implemented computational model is based on Lagrangian particle tracking in Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes resolved turbulent flow. Within this framework, the effects of different flow rates, particle diameters and lung sizes are investigated to enable new insights into local particle deposition behavior and therefore virus loads among selected age groups. We identify a signicant increase of aerosol deposition in the upper airways and thus a strong reduction of virus load in the lower airways for younger individuals. Based on our findings, we propose a possible relation between the younger age related fluid mechanical protection of the lower lung regions due to the airway size and a reduced risk of developing a severe respiratory illness originating from COVID-19 airborne transmission.","Wedel, Jana; Steinmann, Paul; Štrakl, Mitja; Hriberšek, Matjaž; Ravnik, Jure",Comput Mech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758453/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00466-021-01988-5,15
604937,Lack of small animal model hinders MERS coronavirus research,2013-08-06,"A dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been involved in the genesis of lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome from different causes, including several viral infections. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of pneumocytes, the hallmark of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) involving both alveolar interstitium and capillaries, is linked to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and its functional downregulation. ACE2 is a key enzyme for the balance between the two main arms of the RAS: the ACE/angiotensin (Ang) II/Ang II type 1 receptor axis (“classic RAS”) and the ACE2/Ang(1–7)/Mas receptor (MasR) axis (“anti-RAS”). The ACE2 downregulation, as a result of SARS-coronaviruses binding, enhances the classic RAS, leading to lung damage and inflammation with leaky pulmonary blood vessels and fibrosis, when the attenuation mediated by the anti-RAS arm is reduced. ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) and Ang II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB), effective in cardiovascular diseases, were found to prevent and counteract acute lung injury in several experimental models by restoring the balance between these two opposing arms. The evidence of RAS arm disequilibrium in COVID-19 and the hypothesis of a beneficial role of RAS modulation supported by preclinical and clinical studies are the focus of the present review. Preclinical and clinical studies on drugs balancing RAS arms might be the right way to counter COVID-19.","Sarzani, Riccardo; Giulietti, Federico; Di Pentima, Chiara; Giordano, Piero; Spannella, Francesco",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32639866/; https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00189.2020,15

Real-time RT - PCR (Reverse transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) is used to amplify the viral RNA and enable its detection. Although PCR is 37 years old, it is still considered, without dispute, as the gold standard. PCR is an efficient process, but the complex engineering required for automated RNA extraction and temperature cycling makes it incompatible for use in point of care settings. In the present work, by harnessing progress made in the past two decades in DNA amplification, microfluidics and membrane technologies, we succeeded to create a portable test, in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA is extracted, amplified isothermally by RT - LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification), and detected using intercalating dyes or highly fluorescent probes. Depending on the viral load, the detection takes between twenty minutes and one hour. Using pools of naso-pharyngal clinical samples, we estimated a sensitivity comparable to RT-qPCR (up to a Cycle threshold of 39, equivalent to <0.1 TCID50 per mL) and a 100% specificity, for other human coronaviruses and eight respiratory viruses currently circulating in Europe. We designed and fabricated an easy-to-use portable device called COVIDISC to carry out the test at the point of care. The low cost of the materials along with the absence of complex equipment paves the way towards a large dissemination of this device. The perspective of a reliable SARS-CoV-2 point of care detection, highly performing, that would deliver on-site results in less than one hour opens up a new efficient approach to manage the pandemics.","Garneret, P.; Coz, E.; Martin, E.; Manuguerra, J.-C.; Brient-Litzler, E.; Enouf, V.; Gonzalez Obando, D.

605683,Lipopeptides for Vaccine Development,2021-07-06,"BACKGROUND: Immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination has been threatened by recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants. A systematic summary of the landscape of neutralizing antibodies against emerging variants is needed. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and 3 pre-print servers for studies that evaluated neutralizing antibodies titers induced by previous infection or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 variants and comprehensively collected individual data. We calculated lineage-specific GMTs across different study participants and types of neutralization assays. FINDINGS: We identified 56 studies, including 2,483 individuals and 8,590 neutralization tests, meeting the eligibility criteria. Compared with lineage B, we estimate a 1.5-fold (95% CI: 1.0–2.2) reduction in neutralization against the B.1.1.7, 8.7-fold (95% CI: 6.5–11.7) reduction against B.1.351 and 5.0-fold (95% CI: 4.0–6.2) reduction against P.1. The estimated neutralization reductions for B.1.351 compared to lineage B were 240.2-fold (95% CI: 124.0–465.6) reduction for non-replicating vector platform, 4.6-fold (95% CI: 4.0–5.2) reduction for RNA platform, and 1.6-fold (95% CI: 1.2–2.1) reduction for protein subunit platform. The neutralizing antibodies induced by administration of inactivated vaccines and mRNA vaccines against lineage P.1 were also remarkably reduced by an average of 5.9-fold (95% CI: 3.7–9.3) and 1.5-fold (95% CI: 1.2–1.9). INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that the antibody response established by natural infection or vaccination might be able to effectively neutralize B.1.1.7, but neutralizing titers against B.1.351 and P.1 suffered large reductions. Standardized protocols for neutralization assays, as well as updating immune-based prevention and treatment, are needed.

In anticipation of ventilator shortages and limited ICU bed capacity, hospital operations prioritized the development of prognostic tools to predict clinical deterioration. However, early experience from frontline physicians observed that some patients developed unanticipated deterioration after having relatively stable periods, attesting to the uncertainty of clinical trajectories among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Prediction tools that incorporate clinical variables at one time-point, usually on hospital presentation, are suboptimal for patients with dynamic changes and evolving clinical trajectories. Therefore, our study team developed a machine-learning algorithm to predict clinical deterioration among hospitalized COVID-19 patients by extracting clinically meaningful features from complex longitudinal laboratory and vital sign values during the early period of hospitalization with an emphasis on informative missing-ness. To incorporate the evolution of the disease and clinical practice over the course of the pandemic, we utilized a time-dependent cross-validation strategy for model development. Finally, we validated our prediction model on an external validation cohort of COVID-19 patients served in a demographically distinct population from the training cohort. The main finding of our study is the identification of risk profiles of early, late and no clinical deterioration during the course of hospitalization. While risk prediction models that include simple predictors at ED presentation and clinical judgement are able to identify any deterioration vs. no deterioration, our methodology is able to isolate a particular risk group that remain stable initially but deteriorate at a later stage of the course of hospitalization. We demonstrate the superior predictive performance with the utilization of laboratory and vital sign data during the early period of hospitalization compared to the utilization of data at presentation alone. Our results will allow efficient hospital resource allocation and will motivate research in understanding the late deterioration risk group.","Mauer, Elizabeth; Lee, Jihui; Choi, Justin; Zhang, Hongzhe; Hoffman, Katherine L.; Easthausen, Imaani J.; Rajan, Mangala; Weiner, Mark G.; Kaushal, Rainu; Safford, Monika M.; Steel, Peter A.D.; Banerjee, Samprit",J Biomed Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33933654/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046421001234?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046421001234; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103794,15
607871,Systemic antiviral immunization by virus-mimicking nanoparticles-decorated erythrocytes,2021-09-04,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is an acutely progressing brain dysfunction induced by systemic inflammation. The mechanism of initiation of neuroinflammation during SAE, which ultimately leads to delirium and cognitive dysfunction, remains elusive. We aimed to study the molecular events of SAE to capture its onset and progression into the central nervous system (CNS), and further identify the cellular players involved in mediating acute inflammatory signaling. Gene expression profiling on the cerebral vessels isolated from the brains of the mice treated with peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) revealed that the cerebral vasculature responds within minutes to acute systemic inflammation by upregulating the expression of immediate early response genes, followed by activation of the nuclear factor-κB pathway. To identify the earliest responding cell type, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to sort the glial and vascular cells from the brains of the mice treated with LPS at different time points, and RNA-seq was performed on microglia and cerebral endothelial cells (CECs). Bioinformatic analysis followed by further validation in all the cell types revealed that panendothelitis. i.e., the activation of CECs is the earliest event in the CNS during the inception of acute neuroinflammation. Microglial activation occurs later than that of CECs, suggesting that CECs are the most likely initial source of proinflammatory mediators, which could further initiate glial cell activation. This is then followed by the activation of apoptotic signaling in the CECs, which is known to lead to the blood–brain barrier disruption and allow peripheral cytokines to leak into the CNS, exacerbate the gliosis, and result in the vicious neuroinflammatory cascade. Together, our results model the earliest sequential events during the advancement of systemic inflammation into the CNS and facilitate to understand the interplay between the vascular and glial cells in initiating and driving acute neuroinflammation during SAE.","Kodali, Mahesh Chandra; Chen, Hao; Liao, Francesca-Fang",Mol Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-00955-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33293688/,15

Here we examine the functional and structural consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a reconstructed human bronchial epithelium model. SARS-CoV-2 replication causes a transient decrease in epithelial barrier function and disruption of tight junctions, though viral particle crossing remains limited. Rather, SARS-CoV-2 replication leads to a rapid loss of the ciliary layer, characterized at the ultrastructural level by axoneme loss and misorientation of remaining basal bodies. Downregulation of the master regulator of ciliogenesis Foxj1 occurs prior to extensive cilia loss, implicating this transcription factor in the dedifferentiation of ciliated cells. Motile cilia function is compromised by SARS-CoV-2 infection, as measured in a mucociliary clearance assay. Epithelial defense mechanisms, including basal cell mobilization and interferon-lambda induction, ramp up only after the initiation of cilia damage. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters further demonstrates the loss of motile cilia in vivo. This study identifies cilia damage as a pathogenic mechanism that could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 spread to the deeper lung parenchyma.","Robinot, Rémy; Hubert, Mathieu; de Melo, Guilherme Dias; Lazarini, Françoise; Bruel, Timothée; Smith, Nikaïa; Levallois, Sylvain; Larrous, Florence; Fernandes, Julien; Gellenoncourt, Stacy; Rigaud, Stéphane; Gorgette, Olivier; Thouvenot, Catherine; Trébeau, Céline; Mallet, Adeline; Duménil, Guillaume; Gobaa, Samy; Etournay, Raphaël; Lledo, Pierre-Marie; Lecuit, Marc; Bourhy, Hervé; Duffy, Darragh; Michel, Vincent; Schwartz, Olivier; Chakrabarti, Lisa A.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34272374/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24521-x,15

PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the impact of traditional Indian Ayurvedic treatment regime on asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection. STUDY DESIGN: It is a placebo controlled randomized double-blind pilot clinical trial. METHODS: The study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (vide Registration No. CTRI/2020/05/025273) and conducted at the Department of Medicine in National Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Jaipur, India. 1 g of Giloy Ghanvati (Tinospora cordifolia) and 2 g of Swasari Ras (traditional herbo-mineral formulation) and 0.5 g each of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) and Tulsi Ghanvati (Ocimum sanctum) were given orally to the patients in treatment group twice per day for 7 days. Medicines were given in the form of tablets and each tablet weighed 500 mg. While, Swasari Ras was administered in powdered form, 30 min before breakfasts and dinners, rest were scheduled for 30 min post-meals. Patients in the treatment group also received 4 drops of Anu taila (traditional nasal drop) in each nostril every day 1 h before breakfast. Patients in the placebo group received identical-looking tablets and drops, post randomization and double blinded assortments. RT-qPCR test was used for the detection of viral load in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of study participants during the study. Chemiluminescent immunometric assay was used to quantify serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) on day 1 and day 7 of the study. RESULTS: By day 3, 71.1 % and 50.0 % patients recovered in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment group witnessed 100% recovery by day 7, while it was 60.0 % in the placebo group. Average fold changes in serum levels of hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α in treatment group were respectively, 12.4, 2.5 and 20 times lesser than those in the placebo group at day 7. There was 40% absolute reduction in the risk of delayed recovery from infection in the treatment group.

Here, we estimate the potential number of lives saved and life years gained if this treatment were to be rolled out in the UK and globally, as well as the cost-effectiveness of implementing this intervention. Assuming SARS-CoV-2 exposure levels of 5% to 15%, we estimate that, for the UK, approximately 12,000 (4,250 - 27,000) lives could be saved between July and December 2020. Assuming that dexamethasone has a similar effect size in settings where access to oxygen therapies is limited, this would translate into approximately 650,000 (240,000 - 1,400,000) lives saved globally over the same time period. If dexamethasone acts differently in these settings, the impact could be less than half of this value. To estimate the full potential of dexamethasone in the global fight against COVID-19, it is essential to perform clinical research in settings with limited access to oxygen and/or ventilators, for example in low- and middle-income countries.","Águas, Ricardo; Mahdi, Adam; Shretta, Rima; Horby, Peter; Landray, Martin; White, Lisa",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33568665/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21134-2,15

612414,Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel quinazolinone–thiazolidine–quinoline compounds,2013-07-31,"The therapeutic utility of opioids is diminished by their ability to induce rewarding behaviors that may lead to opioid use disorder. Recently, the endogenous cannabinoid system has emerged as a hot topic in the study of opioid reward but relatively little is known about how repeated opioid exposure may affect the endogenous cannabinoid system in the mesolimbic reward circuitry. In the present study, we investigated how sustained morphine may modulate the endogenous cannabinoid system in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of Sprague Dawley rats, a critical region in the mesolimbic reward circuitry. Studies here using proteomic analysis and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) found that the VTA expresses 32 different proteins or genes related to the endogenous cannabinoid system; three of these proteins or genes (PLCγ2, ABHD6, and CB2R) were significantly affected after repeated morphine exposure (CB2R was only detected by qRT-PCR but not proteomics). We also identified that repeated morphine treatment does not alter either anandamide (AEA) or 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) levels in the VTA compared to saline treatment; however, there may be diminished levels of anandamide (AEA) production in the VTA 4 h after a single morphine injection in both chronic saline and morphine pretreated cohorts. Treating the animals with an inhibitor of 2-AG degradation significantly decreased repeated opioid rewarding behavior. Taken together, our studies reveal a potential influence of sustained opioids on the endocannabinoid system in the VTA, suggesting that the endogenous cannabinoid system may participate in the opioid-induced reward.","Zhang, Hong; Lipinski, Austin A.; Liktor-Busa, Erika; Smith, Angela F.; Moutal, Aubin; Khanna, Rajesh; Langlais, Paul R.; Largent-Milnes, Tally M.; Vanderah, Todd W.",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33953672/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.632757,15
612680,Insights and Ideas Garnered from Marine Metabolites for Development of Dual-Function Acetylcholinesterase and Amyloid-β Aggregation Inhibitors,2014-04-04,"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer who are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are more likely to develop severe illness and die compared with those without cancer. The impact of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) on the severity of COVID-19 illness is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether ICI confers an additional risk for severe COVID-19 in patients with cancer. METHODS: We analyzed data from 110 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 while on treatment with ICI without chemotherapy in 19 hospitals in North America, Europe and Australia. The primary objective was to describe the clinical course and to identify factors associated with hospital and intensive care (ICU) admission and mortality. FINDINGS: Thirty-five (32%) patients were admitted to hospital and 18 (16%) died. All patients who died had advanced cancer, and only four were admitted to ICU. COVID-19 was the primary cause of death in 8 (7%) patients. Factors independently associated with an increased risk for hospital admission were ECOG ≥2 (OR 39.25, 95% CI 4.17 to 369.2, p=0.0013), treatment with combination ICI (OR 5.68, 95% CI 1.58 to 20.36, p=0.0273) and presence of COVID-19 symptoms (OR 5.30, 95% CI 1.57 to 17.89, p=0.0073). Seventy-six (73%) patients interrupted ICI due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, 43 (57%) of whom had resumed at data cut-off. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19–related mortality in the ICI-treated population does not appear to be higher than previously published mortality rates for patients with cancer. Inpatient mortality of patients with cancer treated with ICI was high in comparison with previously reported rates for hospitalized patients with cancer and was due to COVID-19 in almost half of the cases. We identified factors associated with adverse outcomes in ICI-treated patients with COVID-19.","Rogiers, Aljosja; Pires da Silva, Ines; Tentori, Chiara; Tondini, Carlo Alberto; Grimes, Joseph M; Trager, Megan H; Nahm, Sharon; Zubiri, Leyre; Manos, Michael; Bowling, Peter; Elkrief, Arielle; Papneja, Neha; Vitale, Maria Grazia; Rose, April A N; Borgers, Jessica S W; Roy, Severine; Mangana, Joanna; Pimentel Muniz, Thiago; Cooksley, Tim; Lupu, Jeremy; Vaisman, Alon; Saibil, Samuel D; Butler, Marcus O; Menzies, Alexander M; Carlino, Matteo S; Erdmann, Michael; Berking, Carola; Zimmer, Lisa; Schadendorf, Dirk; Pala, Laura; Queirolo, Paola; Posch, Christian; Hauschild, Axel; Dummer, Reinhard; Haanen, John; Blank, Christian U; Robert, Caroline; Sullivan, Ryan J; Ascierto, Paolo Antonio; Miller Jr, Wilson H; Stephen Hodi, F; Suijkerbuijk, Karijn P M; Reynolds, Kerry L; Rahma, Osama E; Lorigan, Paul C; Carvajal, Richard D; Lo, Serigne; Mandala, Mario; Long, Georgina V",J Immunother Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2020-001931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33468556/,15
612748,Comparative study on the antiviral activity of selected monoterpenes derived from essential oils,2009-08-03,"Background: A variety of neuroimaging abnormalities in COVID-19 have been described. Objectives: In this article, we reviewed the varied neuroimaging patterns in patients with COVID-19-associated neurological complications. Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and preprint databases (medRxiv and bioRxiv). The search terms we used were ""COVID -19 and encephalitis, encephalopathy, neuroimaging or neuroradiology"" and ""SARS-CoV-2 and encephalitis, encephalopathy, neuroimaging or neuroradiology"". Results: Neuroimaging abnormalities are common in old age and patients with comorbidities. Neuroimaging abnormalities are largely vascular in origin. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy results in large vessel occlusion and cerebral venous thrombosis. COVID-19-associated intracerebral hemorrhage resembles anticoagulant associated intracerebral hemorrhage. On neuroimaging, hypoxic-ischemic damage along with hyperimmune reaction against the SARS-COV-2 virus manifests as small vessel disease. Small vessel disease appears as diffuse leukoencephalopathy and widespread microbleeds, and subcortical white matter hyperintensities. Occasionally, gray matter hyperintensity, similar to those observed seen in autoimmune encephalitis, has been noted. In many cases, white matter lesions similar to that in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis have been described. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in COVID-19 seems to be a parainfectious event and autoimmune in origin. Many cases of acute necrotizing encephalitis resulting in extensive damage to thalamus and brain stem have been described; cytokine storm has been considered a pathogenic mechanism behind this. None of the neuroimaging abnormalities can provide a clue to the possible pathogenic mechanism. Conclusions: Periventricular white-matter MR hyperintensity, microbleeds, arterial and venous infarcts, and hemorrhages are apparently distinctive neuroimaging abnormalities in patients with COVID-19.","Garg, Ravindra K; Paliwal, Vimal K; Malhotra, Hardeep S; Sharma, Praveen K",Neurol India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904434/; https://doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.314531,15

Previous work showed the presence of a viral accessory protein NS6 in PDCoV-infected cells. In this study, we detected the expression of the NS6 protein in small intestinal tissues of PDCoV-infected piglets. In addition, SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of sucrose gradient-purified virions showed the presence of a 13-kDa NS6 protein. Further evidences of the presence of NS6 in the PDCoV virions were obtained by immunogold staining of purified virions with anti-NS6 antiserum, and by immunoprecipitation of NS6 from purified virions. Finally, the anti-NS6 antibody was not able to neutralize PDCoV in cultured cells. These data establish for the first time that the accessory protein NS6 is expressed during infection in vivo and incorporated into PDCoV virions.","Qin, Pan; Luo, Wen-Ting; Su, Quan; Zhao, Pengwei; Zhang, Yuqi; Wang, Bin; Yang, Yong-Le; Huang, Yao-Wei",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2021.01.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33515858/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682221000192?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682221000192,15

614963,Of mitochondrion and COVID-19,2021-06-09,"The Rhabdoviridae is one of the most ecologically diverse families of RNA viruses with members infecting a wide range of organisms including placental mammals, marsupials, birds, reptiles, fish, insects and plants. The availability of complete nucleotide sequences for an increasing number of rhabdoviruses has revealed that their ecological diversity is reflected in the diversity and complexity of their genomes. The five canonical rhabdovirus structural protein genes (N, P, M, G and L) that are shared by all rhabdoviruses are overprinted, overlapped and interspersed with a multitude of novel and diverse accessory genes. Although not essential for replication in cell culture, several of these genes have been shown to have roles associated with pathogenesis and apoptosis in animals, and cell-to-cell movement in plants. Others appear to be secreted or have the characteristics of membrane-anchored glycoproteins or viroporins. However, most encode proteins of unknown function that are unrelated to any other known proteins. Understanding the roles of these accessory genes and the strategies by which rhabdoviruses use them to engage, divert and re-direct cellular processes will not only present opportunities to develop new anti-viral therapies but may also reveal aspects of cellar function that have broader significance in biology, agriculture and medicine.","Walker, Peter J.; Dietzgen, Ralf G.; Joubert, D.

614980,Plant tissue distribution and chemical inactivation of six carnation viruses,2006-12-11,"The infectious power of coronaviruses is dependent on cholesterol present in the membranes of their target cells. Indeed, the virus enters the infected cell either by fusion or by endocytosis, in both cases involving cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains. These membrane domains can be disorganized in-vitro by various cholesterol-altering agents, including statins that inhibit cell cholesterol biosynthesis. As a consequence, numerous cell physiology processes, such as signaling cascades, can be compromised. Also, some examples of anti-bacterial and anti-viral effects of statins have been observed for infectious agents known to be cholesterol dependent. In-vivo, besides their widely-reported hypocholesterolemic effect, statins display various pleiotropic effects mediated, at least partially, by perturbation of membrane microdomains as a consequence of the alteration of endogenous cholesterol synthesis. It should thus be worth considering a high, but clinically well-tolerated, dose of statin to treat Covid-19 patients, in the early phase of infection, to inhibit virus entry into the target cells, in order to control the viral charge and hence avoid severe clinical complications. Based on its efficacy and favorable biodisposition, an option would be considering Atorvastatin, but randomized controlled clinical trials are required to test this hypothesis. This new therapeutic proposal takes benefit from being a drug repurposing, applied to a widely-used drug presenting a high efficiency-to-toxicity ratio. Additionally, this therapeutic strategy avoids any risk of drug resistance by viral mutation since it is host-targeted. Noteworthy, the same pharmacological approach could also be proposed to address different animal coronavirus endemic infections that are responsible for heavy economic losses.","Orlowski, Stéphane; Mourad, Jean-Jacques; Gallo, Antonio; Bruckert, Eric",Biochimie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2021.06.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34153377/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300908421001516; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908421001516?v=s5,15

616004,The yin and yang of viruses and interferons,2012-02-07,"SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19 and responsible for more than 6 million cases globally, for which no vaccine or antiviral is available. Therefore, this study was planned to investigate the antiviral role of the active constituents against spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 as well as its host ACE2 receptor. Structure-based drug design approach has been used to elucidate the antiviral activity of active constituents present in traditional medicinal plants from Ayurveda. Further, parameters like drug-likeness, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity were determined to ensure the safety and efficacy of active constituents. Gene network analysis was performed to investigate the pathways altered during COVID-19. The prediction of drug–target interactions was performed to discover novel targets for active constituents. The results suggested that amarogentin, eufoliatorin, α-amyrin, caesalpinins, kutkin, β-sitosterol, and belladonnine are the top-ranked molecules have the highest affinity towards both the spike glycoprotein and ACE2. Most active constituents have passed the criteria of drug-likeness and demonstrated good pharmacokinetic profile with minimum predicted toxicity level. Gene network analysis confirmed that G-protein coupled receptor, protein kinase B signaling, protein secretion, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, nuclear transport, apoptotic pathway, tumor necrosis factor, regulation of angiotensin level, positive regulation of ion transport, and membrane protein proteolysis were altered during COVID-19. The target prediction analysis revealed that most active constituents target the same pathways which are found to be altered during COVID-19. Collectively, our data encourages the use of active constituents as a potential therapy for COVID-19. However, further studies are ongoing to confirm its efficacy against disease.","Maurya, Vimal K.; Kumar, Swatantra; Bhatt, Madan L.

Study design/Methods: We tested 13,428 residual samples retrieved from pregnant women participating in first trimester combined ultrasound and biochemical screening for fetal trisomy (CUBS) across Scotland for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over a 6-month period from November 2020-April 2021. Seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the assays and weighted to reference populations. Results Seroprevalence rates in the antenatal samples significantly increased from 5.5% (95% CI 4.7%-6.5%) in the 5-week period up to and including ISO week 51 (w/b Monday 14th December 2020) to 11.3% (95% CI 10.1%-12.6%) in the 5-week period up to and including ISO week 14 (w/b Monday 05th April 2021). Increasing seroprevalence trends across the second wave were observed among all age-groups. Conclusions By the end of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, around one in 10 women tested around the end of the first trimester of pregnancy had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that the vast majority were still susceptible to COVID-19 as they progressed to the later stages of pregnancy, when risks from infection are elevated for both mother and baby.","McAuley, Andrew; Gousias, Petros; Hassan, Taimoor; Rashid, Lorna; Richardson, Claire; Reid, Graham; Templeton, Kate; McGuire, Jacqueline; Wise, Helen; McVicar, Louise; Jenks, Sara; Gunn, Robyn; Dickson, Elizabeth; Stock, Sarah J.; Stockton, Angela; Waugh, Craig; Wood, Rachael; McMenamin, Jim; Robertson, Chris; Goldberg, David J.; Palmateer, Norah E.",Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34517289/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.08.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350621003309?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350621003309,15
616200,Droplet Cas12a Assay Enables DNA Quantification from Unamplified Samples at the Single-Molecule Level.,2021-05-26,"BACKGROUND: Public mental health (PMH) aims to improve wellbeing and prevent poor mental health at the population level. It is a global challenge and a UK priority area for action. Communities play an important role in the provision of PMH interventions. However, the evidence base concerning community-based PMH interventions is limited, meaning it is challenging to compare service provision to need. Without this, the efficient and equitable provision of services is hindered. Here, we sought to map the current range of community-based interventions for improving mental health and wellbeing currently provided in England to inform priority areas for policy and service intervention. METHOD: We adopted an established mapping exercise methodology, comparing service provision with demographic and deprivation statistics. Five local authority areas of England were selected based on differing demographics, mental health needs and wider challenging circumstances (i.e. high deprivation). Community-based interventions were identified through: 1) desk-based research 2) established professional networks 3) chain-referral sampling of individuals involved in local mental health promotion and prevention and 4) peer researchers’ insight. We included all community-based, non-clinical interventions aimed at adult residents operating between July 2019 and May 2020. RESULTS: 407 interventions were identified across the five areas addressing 16 risk/protective factors for PMH. Interventions for social isolation and loneliness were most prevalent, most commonly through social activities and/or befriending services. The most common subpopulations targeted were older adults and people from minority ethnic backgrounds. Interventions focusing on broader structural and environmental determinants were uncommon. There was some evidence of service provision being tailored to local need, though this was inconsistent, meaning some at-risk groups such as men or LGBTQ+ people from minority ethnic backgrounds were missed. Interventions were not consistently evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: There was evidence of partial responsiveness to national and local prioritising. Provision was geared mainly towards addressing social and individual determinants of PMH, suggesting more integration is needed to engage wider service providers and policy-makers in PMH strategy and delivery at the community level. The lack of comprehensive evaluation of services to improve PMH needs to be urgently addressed to determine the extent of their effectiveness in communities they serve.

616350,Genetic Manipulation of Human Intestinal Enteroids Demonstrates the Necessity of a Functional Fucosyltransferase 2 Gene for Secretor-Dependent Human Norovirus Infection,2020-03-17,"INTRODUCTION: the current worldwide outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is seriously threatening the public health. The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The time from the symptoms’ onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Spontaneous breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic COVID-19 infection will be eligible to enter the study. Patients in the treatment group will receive inhaled NO at high doses (140-180 parts per million) for 30 minutes, 2 sessions every day for 14 days in addition to the hospital care. Patient in the control group will receive only hospital care. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal intubation due to the progression of the disease in the first 28 days from enrollment in the study. Secondary outcomes include mortality at 28 days, proportion of negative test for SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days and time to clinical recovery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial protocol has been approved at the Investigation Review Boards of Xijing Hospital (Xi’an, China) and The Partners Human Research Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) is pending. Recruitment is expected to start in March 2020. Results of this study will be published in scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, and on related website or media in fighting this widespread contagious disease.","Lei, Chong; Su, Binxiao; Dong, Hailong; Fakhr, Bijan Safaee; Grassi, Luigi Giuseppe; Di Fenza, Raffaele; Gianni, Stefano; Pinciroli, Riccardo; Vassena, Emanuele; Morais, Caio Cesar Araujo; Bellavia, Andrea; Spina, Stefano; Kacmarek, Robert; Berra, Lorenzo",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511450/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033522,15

A significant factor in the workplace that is thought to influence employees’ mental health is leadership behavior. Hence, effective leadership interventions to foster employees’ (leaders’ and staff members’) mental health might be an important measure to address this pressing issue. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review according to the PRISMA statement (Liberati et al. 2009) and systematically searched the following databases: PubMed (PMC), Web of Science, PsycINFO (EBSCOhost), EconLit (EBSCOhost), and Business Source Premier (EBSCOhost). In addition, we performed a hand search of the reference lists of relevant articles. We included studies investigating leadership interventions in the health care sector that aimed to maintain/foster employees’ mental health. RESULTS: The systematic search produced 11,221 initial search hits in relevant databases. After the screening process and additional literature search, seven studies were deemed eligible according to the inclusion criteria. All studies showed at least a moderate global validity and four of the included studies showed statistically significant improvements of mental health as a result of the leadership interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings, leadership interventions with reflective and interactive parts in group settings at several seminar days seem to be the most promising strategy to address mental health in health care employees.

Hence, the purpose of the study is to set a clear treatment regimen. We report here a therapeutic course of 2 patients who underwent transplant surgery in March 2020 and got infected soon after. Since the transplant, these 2 patients have received triple maintenance immunosuppressive therapy with oral tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisone, and they have been regularly followed up at our hospital. The tacrolimus trough level was between 10 and 12 ng/mL. After the diagnosis of COVID-19, MMF was stopped and the tacrolimus dose was reduced so that blood level was between 4 and 6 ng/mL. The first patient was a 30-year-old man who, despite being treated with hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, oseltamivir, and azithromycin therapy, died because of the presence of other comorbidities. The second case was a 58-year-old man who fully recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia with treatment with methylprednisolone, MMF, azithromycin, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, and reduction in immunosuppression dosage. This reflects the importance of using glucocorticoids in the treatment of COVID-19 along with other medications and the decreased mortality rate associated with their use.","Tekin, Sabri; Özdoğan, Hatice; Demir, Mustafa Kemal; Soultan, Hagar; Zafar, Sadia",Transplant Proc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041134520328992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33451758/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041134520328992; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.10.051,15
618700,Coronaviruses in Bats: A Review for the Americas,2021-06-25,"BACKGROUND: South Africa is a very diverse middle-income country, still deeply divided by the legacy of its colonial and apartheid past. As part of a larger study, this article explored the experiences and views of representatives of hospices in the Western Cape province of South Africa on the provision of appropriate spiritual care, given local issues and constraints. METHODS: Two sets of focus group discussions, with 23 hospice participants, were conducted with 11 of the 12 Hospice Palliative Care Association registered hospices in the Western Cape, South Africa, to understand what spiritual care practices existed in their hospices against the backdrop of multifaceted diversities. The discussions were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Two prominent themes emerged: the challenges of providing relevant spiritual care services in a religiously, culturally, linguistically and racially diverse setting, and the organisational context impacting such a spiritual care service. Participants agreed that spiritual care is an important service and that it plays a significant role within the inter-disciplinary team. Participants recognised the need for spiritual care training and skills development, alongside the financial costs of employing dedicated spiritual care workers. In spite of the diversities and resource constraints, the approach of individual hospices to providing spiritual care remained robust. DISCUSSION: Given the diversities that are largely unique to South Africa, shaped essentially by past injustices, the hospices have to navigate considerable hurdles such as cultural differences, religious diversity, and language barriers to provide spiritual care services, within significant resource constraints. CONCLUSIONS: While each of the hospices have established spiritual care services to varying degrees, there was an expressed need for training in spiritual care to develop a baseline guide that was bespoke to the complexities of the South African context. Part of this training needs to focus on the complexity of providing culturally appropriate services.","Mahilall, Ronita; Swartz, Leslie",BMC Palliat Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423672/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-020-00704-z,15

ObjectiveWe explored the emergence of spatial inequities in COVID-19 testing, positivity, incidence, and mortality in New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago during the first six months of the pandemic. DesignEcological, observational study at the zip code tabulation area (ZCTA) level from March to August 2020. SettingChicago, New York City and Philadelphia. ParticipantsAll populated ZCTAs in the three cities. MeasuresOutcomes were ZCTA-level COVID-19 testing, positivity, incidence, monthly from pandemic onset through the end of August, and ZCTA-level COVID-19 mortality cumulatively through the end of August. Predictors were the CDC social vulnerability index and its four domains, obtained from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. We examined spatial clusters of COVID-19 outcomes using local Morans I and estimated associations using negative binomial models. ResultsWe found spatial clusters of high and low positivity, incidence and mortality, co-located with clusters of low and high social vulnerability. We also found evidence for the existence of spatial inequities in testing, positivity, incidence and mortality for the three cities. Specifically, neighborhoods with higher social vulnerability had lower testing rates, higher positivity ratios, incidence rates and mortality rates. Inequities in testing and incidence changed over time in the three cities, and inequities in positivity stayed consistent over time. LimitationsZCTAs are imperfect and heterogeneous geographical units of analysis. We rely on surveillance data, which may be incomplete.

619427,Pleiotropic roles of the ubiquitin-proteasome system during viral propagation,2018-08-15,"Abstract Introduction Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease, which caused by a novel coronavirus. The disease disrupts health systems and resulting in social, political, and economic crises. Health professionals are in front of this pandemic and always work in a high-risk environment. Currently, there is no vaccine or drug for the disease. Therefore, strictly practicing precautionary measures are the only option to save the life. Some studies reported health professional's practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19. Nevertheless, a few have identified factors affecting. As such, this study aimed to fill those research gaps in the study setting. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 428 health professionals were involved from the public health facilities of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. A simple random sampling method was employed, and the data collected by the interviewer-administered Open Data Kit survey tool and observational checklist. The data analyzed in Stata version 15 and a binary logistic regression model used to identify factors. In this study, a statistically significant association was declared at P<0.05. Results In this study, 35{middle dot}3% (95%CI: 30{middle dot}7%, 39{middle dot}8%) of health professionals' had a good practice on precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Use hand sanitizer or wash hands continuously with soap and water (68{middle dot}9%), cover nose and mouth with a tissue during sneezing or coughing (67{middle dot}3%), and use facemask in crowds (56{middle dot}8%) were the most common practice reported by study participants. Marital status, being married (AOR=1{middle dot}84, 95%CI: 1{middle dot}06, 3.18), good knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR=2{middle dot}02, 95%CI: 1{middle dot}02, 3{middle dot}18), and positive attitude towards precautionary measures for COVID-19 were factors showed signification association with the practice. Conclusions The magnitude of good practice of precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic among health professionals was low. As such, different interventions to improve the knowledge and attitude of health professionals in the health care system are highly needed to boost the practice and to advance service delivery.","Mersha, A.; Shibiru, S.; Girma, M.; Ayele, G.; Bante, A.; Kassa, M.; Abebe, S.; Shewangizaw, M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188805; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.05.20188805v1?rss=1,15

We also explore the role of digital technology in tackling lockdown loneliness amid the pandemic. In this regard, we highlight and discuss a number of the key relevant issues: a description of lockdown loneliness, the burden of lockdown loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic, characteristics of people who are more likely to be affected by lockdown loneliness, factors that could increase the risk of loneliness, lockdown loneliness as an important public health issue, tackling loneliness during the pandemic, digital technology tools for social connection and networking during the pandemic, assessment of digital technology tools from the end users’ perspectives, and access to and use of digital technology for tackling lockdown loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. We suggest that the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people who are more prone to lockdown loneliness are provided with access to digital technology so that they can connect socially with their loved ones and others; this could reduce loneliness resulting from social distancing and lockdowns during the COVID-19 crisis. Nonetheless, some key issues such as access to and knowledge of digital technology tools must be considered. In addition, the involvement of all key stakeholders (family and friends, social care providers, and clinicians and health allied professionals) should be ensured.","Shah, Syed Ghulam Sarwar; Nogueras, David; van Woerden, Hugo Cornelis; Kiparoglou, Vasiliki",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/22287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33108313/,15

Affinity reagents targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are of interest for the development of therapeutics and diagnostics. We used affinity selection–mass spectrometry for the rapid discovery of synthetic high-affinity peptide binders for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. From library screening with 800 million synthetic peptides, we identified three sequences with nanomolar affinities (dissociation constants K(d) = 80–970 nM) for RBD and selectivity over human serum proteins. Nanomolar RBD concentrations in a biological matrix could be detected using the biotinylated lead peptide in ELISA format. These peptides do not compete for ACE2 binding, and their site of interaction on the SARS-CoV-2-spike-RBD might be unrelated to the ACE2 binding site, making them potential orthogonal reagents for sandwich immunoassays. These findings serve as a starting point for the development of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics or conjugates for virus-directed delivery of therapeutics.","Pomplun, Sebastian; Jbara, Muhammad; Quartararo, Anthony J.; Zhang, Genwei; Brown, Joseph S.; Lee, Yen-Chun; Ye, Xiyun; Hanna, Stephanie; Pentelute, Bradley L.",ACS Cent Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527085/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.0c01309,15

Amplicon-based sequencing methods provide a sensitive, low-cost and rapid approach but suffer a high potential for contamination, which can undermine lab processes and results. This challenge will only increase with expanding global production of sequences by diverse research groups for epidemiological and clinical interpretation. We present an approach which uses synthetic DNA spike-ins (SDSIs) to track samples and detect inter-sample contamination through a sequencing workflow. Applying this approach to the ARTIC Consortium’s amplicon design, we define a series of best practices for Illumina-based sequencing and provide a detailed characterization of approaches to increase sensitivity for low-viral load samples incorporating the SDSIs.

Cadaveric shortages have also influenced the need for alternative methods of anatomical education. This study examines the current literature on the use of extended reality technologies (XR) such as Virtual reality (VR), Augmented reality (AR), and Mixed reality (MR) for anatomy teaching and explores its potential for implementation in medical education. METHODS A literature review was performed of PubMed, ProQuest, Science Direct, and Springer databases. Included studies were assessed for user satisfaction, perceived effectiveness, cost, acceptability and side effects. RESULTS The database search identified 1687 papers, of which 45 papers were included in this review. Both AR and VR had high rates of satisfaction and acceptability as a supplementary teaching aid amongst undergraduate participants. AR was found to have higher effectiveness than VR. VR is more expensive than AR. Results and comparisons were limited due to short length of study. CONCLUSIONS VR is a popular choice with undergraduates as an aid to supplement teaching, in spite of the associated cost and side effects such as nausea. AR has shown the most potential for independent study. Larger and long-term studies are required to determine true effectiveness, and consideration of the clinical relevance of these technologies.","Taylor, Lucy; Dyer, Tamsin; Al-Azzawi, Mohammed; Smith, Christian; Nzeako, Obi; Shah, Zameer",Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aanat.2021.151817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34391910/,15

We aimed to categorically test the efficacy and fit of potential N95 respirator substitutes using protocols that can be replicated in university laboratories. SETTING: Academic medical centre with occupational health-supervised fit testing along with laboratory studies. PARTICIPANTS: Seven adult volunteers who passed quantitative fit testing for small-sized (n=2) and regular-sized (n=5) commercial N95 respirators. METHODS: Five open-source potential N95 respirator substitutes were evaluated and compared with commercial National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved N95 respirators as controls. Fit testing using the 7-minute standardised Occupational Safety and Health Administration fit test was performed. In addition, protocols that can be performed in university laboratories for materials testing (filtration efficiency, air resistance and fluid resistance) were developed to evaluate alternate filtration materials. RESULTS: Among five open-source, improvised substitutes evaluated in this study, only one (which included a commercial elastomeric mask and commercial HEPA filter) passed a standard quantitative fit test. The four alternative materials evaluated for filtration efficiency (67%–89%) failed to meet the 95% threshold at a face velocity (7.6 cm/s) equivalent to that of a NIOSH particle filtration test for the control N95 FFR. In addition, for all but one material, the small surface area of two 3D-printed substitutes resulted in air resistance that was above the maximum in the NIOSH standard. CONCLUSIONS: Testing protocols such as those described here are essential to evaluate proposed improvised respiratory protection substitutes, and our testing platform could be replicated by teams with similar cross-disciplinary research capacity. Healthcare professionals should be cautious of claims associated with improvised respirators when suggested as FFR substitutes.","Ballard, David H; Dang, Audrey J; Kumfer, Benjamin M; Weisensee, Patricia B; Meacham, J Mark; Scott, Alex R; Ruppert-Stroescu, Mary; Burke, Broc A; Morris, Jason; Gan, Connie; Hu, Jesse; King, Bradley; Jammalamadaka, Udayabhanu; Sayood, Sena; Liang, Stephen; Choudhary, Shruti; Dhanraj, David; Maranhao, Bruno; Millar, Christine; Bertroche, J Tyler; Shomer, Nirah; Woodard, Pamela K; Biswas, Pratim; Axelbaum, Richard; Genin, Guy; Williams, Brent J; Meacham, Kathleen",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34475144/,15

Endothelial dysfunction is partially responsible for many of the organic dysfunctions in critical illness. Reactive hyperaemia is a vascular response of the endothelium that can be measured by peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT). We aimed to assess if reactive hyperaemia is affected by critical illness and if it correlates with outcomes. Prospective study with a cohort of consecutive patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. RH-PAT was accessed on admission and on the 7th day after admission. Early and late survivors were compared to non-survivors. The effect of RH-PAT variation on late mortality was studied by a logistic regression model. The association between RH-PAT and severity scores and biomarkers of organic dysfunction was investigated by multivariate analysis. 86 patients were enrolled. Mean ln(RHI) on admission was 0.580 and was significantly lower in patients with higher severity scores (p < 0.01) and early non-survivors (0.388; p = 0.027). The model for prediction of early-mortality estimated that each 0.1 decrease in ln(RHI) increased the odds for mortality by 13%. In 39 patients, a 2nd RH-PAT measurement was performed on the 7th day. The variation of ln(RHI) was significantly different between non-survivors and survivors (− 24.2% vs. 63.9%, p = 0.026). Ln(RHI) was significantly lower in patients with renal and cardiovascular dysfunction (p < 0.01). RH-PAT is correlated with disease severity and seems to be an independent marker of early mortality, cardiovascular and renal dysfunctions. RH-PAT variation predicts late mortality. There appears to be an RH-PAT impairment in the acute phase of severe diseases that may be reversible and associated with better outcomes.","Malheiro, Luis Filipe; Gaio, Rita; Vaz da Silva, Manuel; Martins, Sandra; Sarmento, António; Santos, Lurdes",J Clin Monit Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889643/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-020-00586-9,15

Where the ‘probe’ and ‘target’ peptide sequences exactly match, they correspond to ‘chameleon’ sequences in protein structures. We observed ∼548 heptapeptide and large chameleon sequences that included peptides in the coil conformation from 53,794 PDB files that were analyzed. However, after excluding several chameleon peptides based on the quality of protein structure data, redundancy and peptides associated with cloning artifacts, such as, histidine-tags, we observed only ten chameleon peptides in structurally different proteins and the maximum length comprised seven amino acid residues. Our analysis suggests that the quality of protein structure data is important for identifying possibly, the ‘true chameleons’ in PDB. Majority of the chameleon sequences correspond to an entire strand in one protein that is observed as part of helix sequence in another protein. The heptapeptide chameleons are characterized with a high propensity of alanine, leucine and valine amino acid residues.

In Namibia, the national prevalence of diarrhoea was 17%; it was responsible for 5% of all deaths in children under 5 years old and is the second leading cause of death. AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess the epidemiology and factors associated with acute diarrhoea amongst children less than 5 years of age in Engela district in the Ohangwena region, Namibia. SETTING: The study was conducted in Ohangwena Region in Namibia which extends east to west along the borders of the southern part of Angola. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A structured questionnaire was administered through face-to-face interviews. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the socio-demographic and epidemiological data of diarrhoea and logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with the prevalence of diarrhoea. RESULTS: The study found a prevalence of 23.8% for diarrhoea in the 2 weeks period preceding the survey amongst children aged under 5 years. The prevalence of diarrhoea was statistically significantly associated with children (p < 0.05). The strongest predictor of the prevalence of diarrhoea was the residential area ‘informal settlement’, with an odds ratio of 36.42. This implies that children living in the informal settlement are 36.42 times at risk of contracting diarrhoea as compared to those living in other residential areas.

This study investigates whether and how exactly the economic impact of government public health policies varies over time. Focusing on the leisure and recreation industry, we use data for 131 countries/regions from February to May 2020 and employ generalized difference-in-differences models to investigate the short- and longer-term effects of public health policies. We find that stricter policies lead, on average, to an immediate 9.2–percentage-point drop in leisure and recreation participation. Even so, that industry recovers in about seven weeks after a COVID-19 outbreak in countries/regions that undertake active interventions.

625973,Membrane Potential Depolarization as a Triggering Mechanism for Vpu-Mediated HIV-1 Release,2010-09-01,"INTRODUCTION: In 2020, a global pandemic impacted sleep for many people in the US, which was also experiencing an extremely contentious election season. These overlapped somewhat, as the liberal/left side of the political spectrum was more vocal about the dangers of COVID-19 and the pandemic, while the conservative/right frequently expressed less concern about COVID-related risks. Perhaps this confluence was borne out in sleep quality and dreams. METHODS: A sample of N=419 US adults completed online surveys about sleep and COVID-19 experiences. Participants rated their political affiliation on a scale of 0 (Very Conservative/Right) to 6 (Very Liberal/Left). Participants were also asked whether, since the pandemic, their sleep improved or worsened, whether their dream content has become more positive (more or less positive content, versus same) or negative (more or less negative content, versus same), the number of nightmares they recall, and whether their dreams included themes of politics and/or COVID. Regression analyses examined political affiliation as independent variable with ordinal logistic analyses for sleep improvement/worsening, multinomial logistic analyses for positive/negative content, linear regression analyses for nightmare frequency, and binary logistic analyses for presence of political/COVID themes in dreams. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Greater liberal/left affiliation was associated with a greater likelihood of worsened sleep (oOR=1.20, p=0.002), but no difference in likelihood of sleep improvement. Greater liberal/left affiliation was associated with a greater likelihood of decreased positive dream content (RRR=1.29, p=0.001) but no different in likelihood of increased positive content. In addition, greater liberal/left affiliation was associated with an increased likelihood of more negative dream content (RRR=1.33, p<0.0005) but no difference in the experience of less negative content. Liberal/left affiliation was also associated with more frequent nightmares during the pandemic (B=1.55, p=0.019), and more political dreams (OR=1.29, p=0.010) but no difference in COVID-related dreams. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, more liberal/left individuals reported a greater degree of worsening sleep and dream content that was less positive and more negative in nature. Though there was no difference in COVID-related dream content, there was a difference in political content in dreams.

626552,Alignment-free similarity analysis for protein sequences based on fuzzy integral,2019-02-26,"Satellite imagery is changing the way we understand and predict economic activity in the world. Advancements in satellite hardware and low-cost rocket launches have enabled near-real-time, high-resolution images covering the entire Earth. It is too labour-intensive, time-consuming and expensive for human annotators to analyse petabytes of satellite imagery manually. Current computer vision research exploring this problem still lack accuracy and prediction speed, both significantly important metrics for latency-sensitive automatized industrial applications. Here we address both of these challenges by proposing a set of improvements to the object recognition model design, training and complexity regularisation, applicable to a range of neural networks. Furthermore, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) architecture optimised for accurate and accelerated object recognition in multispectral satellite imagery. We show that our FCN exceeds human-level performance with state-of-the-art 97.67% accuracy over multiple sensors, it is able to generalize across dispersed scenery and outperforms other proposed methods to date. Its computationally light architecture delivers a fivefold improvement in training time and a rapid prediction, essential to real-time applications. To illustrate practical model effectiveness, we analyse it in algorithmic trading environment. Additionally, we publish a proprietary annotated satellite imagery dataset for further development in this research field. Our findings can be readily implemented for other real-time applications too.","Gudžius, Povilas; Kurasova, Olga; Darulis, Vytenis; Filatovas, Ernestas",Mach Vis Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177121/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00138-021-01209-2,15

The way the virus spreads inside hosts, and how this spread interacts with host immunity and physiology, is likely to determine variation in health outcomes. Decades of data and dynamical analyses of how other viruses spread and interact with host cells could shed light on SARS-CoV-2 within-host trajectories. We review how common axes of variation in within-host dynamics and emergent pathology (such as age and sex) might be combined with ecological principles to understand the case of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight pitfalls in application of existing theoretical frameworks relevant to the complexity of the within-host context and frame the discussion in terms of growing knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2. Viewing health outcomes for SARS-CoV-2 through the lens of ecological models underscores the value of repeated measures on individuals, especially since many lines of evidence suggest important contingence on trajectory.","Metcalf, C.

Here we use an individual based model (IBM) to study how the duration, start date and intensity of quarantine affect the height and position of the peak of the infection curve. We show that stochastic effects, inherent to the model dynamics, lead to variable outcomes for the same set of parameters, making it crucial to compute the probability of each result. To simplify the analysis we divide the outcomes in only two categories, that we call best and worst scenarios. Although long and intense quarantine is the best way to end the epidemic, it is very hard to implement in practice. Here we show that relatively short and intense quarantine periods can also be very effective in flattening the infection curve and even killing the virus, but the likelihood of such outcomes are low. Long quarantines of relatively low intensity, on the other hand, can delay the infection peak and reduce its size considerably with more than 50% probability, being a more effective policy than complete lockdown for short periods.","Marquioni, Vitor M.; de Aguiar, Marcus A.M.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920303970; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109999; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834581/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920303970,15

As the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is the main catalytic subunit of telomerase holoenzyme, we also monitored effect of ATA on telomerase activity in vivo and observed dose-dependent inhibition of telomerase activity in Chinese hamster V79 cells treated with ATA. Direct association of ATA with DNase I (K(d) = 9.019 μM)), RNase A (K(d) = 2.33 μM) reverse transcriptase (K(d) = 0.255 μM) and Taq polymerase (K(d) = 81.97 μM) was further shown by tryptophan fluorescence quenching studies. Such association altered the three-dimensional conformation of DNase I, RNase A and Taq polymerase as detected by circular dichroism. We propose ATA inhibits enzymatic activity of the four proteins through interfering with DNA or RNA binding to the respective proteins either competitively or allosterically, i.e. by perturbing three-dimensional structure of enzymes.","Ghosh, Utpal; Giri, Kalyan; Bhattacharyya, Nitai P.",Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19836295/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386142509004612; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.saa.2009.09.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386142509004612,15

The inhospital use of RASi and its effect on inflammatory sate are still poorly studied during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the impact of previous and inhospital RASi exposure on the outcome and inflammatory response of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Single-centre, ambispective analysis of hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients at Hospital de Santa Maria, Lisbon, between March and August 2020 was performed. We excluded asymptomatic patients and those admitted due to another disease. The primary outcome was inhospital all-cause mortality. Illness severity was assessed based on the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury (ARDS/ALI), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). We used C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) as surrogate markers of the inflammatory response. RESULTS: From a total of 432 patients, 279 were selected, among whom 133 (47.7%) were receiving a RASi. Chronic treatment with RASi was not associated with the risk of death (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.66–2.31, p=0.500), ARDS/ALI development (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.67–1.86, p=0.676), ICU admission (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.67–1.84, p = 0.686), and IMV need (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.58–1.84, p=0.917) in a univariable and multivariable analysis. Inhospital RASi withdrawing was associated with the risk of death (OR 4.38, 95% CI 1.11–17.21, p=0.035) and ARDS/ALI development (OR 4.33, 95% CI 1.49–12.6, p=0.007), the latter remaining significant after adjustment. Previous exposure to RASi was associated with lower CRP levels at admission (p=0.018). IL-6 levels were significantly higher in those patients whose RASi were stopped (p=0.024). CONCLUSION: Previous and inhospital exposure to RASi was not associated with mortality nor severity of COVID-19. This study supports current guidance on RASi management during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gaspar, Pedro; Parreira, Inês; Antunes Meireles, Pedro; Bessa, Filipe; Dias Silva, Virgílio; Abrantes, Ana Mafalda; Pais de Lacerda, António; Mota, Catarina",Int J Hypertens,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5517441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824762/,15

We enrolled two groups of patients hospitalized for Covid‐19, i.e., kidney transplant recipients from the French Registry of Solid Organ Transplant (n=306) and a single‐center cohort of non‐transplant patients (n=795). An analysis was performed among subgroups matched for age and risk factors for severe Covid‐19 or mortality. Severe Covid‐19 was defined as admission (or transfer) to an intensive care unit, need for mechanical ventilation, or death.Transplant recipients were younger and had more comorbidities compared to non‐transplant patients. They presented with higher creatinine levels and developed more episodes of acute kidney injury. After matching, the 30‐day cumulative incidence of severe Covid‐19 did not differ between KTR and non‐transplant patients; however, 30‐day Covid‐19‐related mortality was significantly higher in KTR (17.9% versus 11.4%, respectively, p=0.038). Age >60 years, cardiovascular disease, dyspnea, fever, lymphopenia, and C‐reactive protein (CRP) were associated with severe Covid‐19 in univariate analysis, whereas transplant status and serum creatinine levels were not. Age >60 years, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, CRP >60 mg/L, lymphopenia, kidney transplant status (HR=1.55), and creatinine level >115 µmol/L (HR=2.32) were associated with Covid‐19‐related mortality in univariate analysis. In multivariable analysis, cardiovascular disease, dyspnea, and fever were associated with severe disease, whereas age >60 years, cardiovascular disease, dyspnea, fever, and creatinine level>115 µmol/L retained their independent associations with mortality.

629065,Nanomaterial-based biosensors for detection of pathogenic virus,2017-10-13,"BACKGROUND: Regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) for the prevention of clotting of the extracorporeal blood circuit during continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) has been employed in limited fashion because of the complexity and complications associated with certain protocols. Hypertonic citrate infusion to achieve circuit anticoagulation results in variable systemic citrate- and sodium load and increases the risk of citrate accumulation and hypernatremia. The practice of “single starting calcium infusion rate for all patients” puts patients at risk for clinically significant hypocalcemia if filter effluent calcium losses exceed replacement. A fixed citrate to blood flow ratio, personalized effluent and pre-calculated calcium infusion dosing based on tables derived through kinetic analysis enable providers to use continuous veno-venous hemo-diafiltration (CVVHDF)-RCA in patients with liver citrate clearance of at least 6 L/h. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective observational study conducted in intensive care unit patients triaged to be treated with the novel pre-calculated CVVHDF-RCA “Non-shock” protocol. RCA efficacy outcomes were time to first hemofilter loss and circuit ionized calcium (iCa) levels. Safety outcomes were surrogate of citrate accumulation (TCa/iCa ratio) and the incidence of acid-base and electrolyte complications. RESULTS: Of 53 patients included in the study, 31 (59%) had acute kidney injury and 12 (22.6%) had the diagnosis of cirrhosis at the start of CVVHDF-RCA. The median first hemofilter life censored for causes other than clotting exceeded 70 h. The cumulative incidence of hypernatremia (Na > 148 mM), metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- > 30 mM), hypocalcemia (iCa < 0.9 mM) and hypercalcemia (iCa > 1.5 mM) were 1/47 (1%), 0/50 (0%), 1/53 (2%), 1/53 (2%) respectively and were not clinically significant. The median (25th–75th percentile) of the highest TCa/iCa ratio for every 24-h interval on CKRT was 1.99 (1.91–2.13). CONCLUSIONS: The fixed citrate to blood flow ratio, as opposed to a titration approach, achieves adequate circuit iCa (< 0.4 mm/L) for any hematocrit level and plasma flow. The personalized dosing approach for calcium supplementation based on pre-calculated effluent calcium losses as opposed to the practice of “one starting dose for all” reduces the risk of clinically significant hypocalcemia. The fixed flow settings achieve clinically desirable steady state systemic electrolyte levels.","Yessayan, Lenar; Sohaney, Ryann; Puri, Vidhit; Wagner, Benjamin; Riddle, Amy; Dickinson, Sharon; Napolitano, Lena; Heung, Michael; Humes, David; Szamosfalvi, Balazs",BMC Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34215201/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-021-02443-6,15

Decades of research have shown that exposure to misinformation can have significant impacts on people's thoughts, actions, and memories. During global pandemics like COVID‐19, people are likely exposed to heightened quantities of misinformation as they search for and are exposed to copious amounts of information about the disease and its effects. This media environment, with an abundance of both accurate and inaccurate information, is often called an “infodemic.” In the current essay, we discuss the consequences of exposure to misinformation during this infodemic, particularly in the domain of memory. We review existing research demonstrating how inaccurate, postevent information impacts a person's memory for a previously witnessed event. We discuss various factors that strengthen the impact of misinformation, including repetition and whether the misinformation is consistent with people's pre‐existing attitudes or beliefs. We conclude by describing how social media companies and individual users can help prevent the spread of misinformation and the ways in which cognitive science research can inform these approaches.","Greenspan, Rachel Leigh; Loftus, Elizabeth F.",Hum Behav Emerg Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33363274/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hbe2.228,15

Among 45 children who visited the ship’s childcare center, infection rate for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was higher than that for influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Disembarked passengers reported a high level of compliance with isolation and quarantine recommendations. We found 4 subsequent cases epidemiologically linked to passengers but no evidence of sustained transmission to the community or passengers on the next cruise. Among this population of generally healthy passengers, children seemed more susceptible to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 than to influenza (H3N2) viruses.

METHODS: This prospective cohort study included all international attendees. All participants required a minimum of one negative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) test prior to travelling to each tournament. High-risk contacts were isolated for 10 days. Moderate-risk contacts received education regarding enhanced medical surveillance, had daily rapid antigen testing for 5 days, with RT-PCR day 5, mandated mask use and access to outside space for work purposes only. Low-risk contacts received rapid antigen testing every 48 hours and PCR testing on day 5. RESULTS: A total of 550 persons were accredited and were required to undergo RT-PCR testing before the event. Two of these tests were positive (0.36%). Of these, case 1 had 1 high, 23 moderate and 48 low-risk contacts. Case 2 did not have any significant travel history within 2 days of positive test and had one high-risk contact. There were no further positive tests on site in the wider cohort of attendees, from a total of 872 RT-PCR and 198 rapid antigen tests.

Thus, assimilating profiles of systemic inflammatory mediators with sMAdCAM levels may provide insights into the progression of COVID-19 disease. Also, the role of these markers in governing virus specific immunity following infection remains largely unexplored. A cohort (n = 84) of SARS-C0V-2 infected individuals included a group of in-patients (n = 60) at various stages of disease progression together with convalescent individuals (n = 24) recruited between April and June 2020 from Mumbai, India. Follow-up of 35 in-patients at day 7 post diagnosis was carried out. Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines along with soluble MAdCAM (sMAdCAM) levels in plasma were measured. Also, anti-viral humoral response as measured by rapid antibody test (IgG, IgM), Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (IgG), and antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) from plasma. IL-6 and sMAdCAM levels among in-patients inversely correlated with one another.

The aim of this study was to describe lung ultrasound findings and their prognostic value in patients with COVID-19 admitted to internal medicine ward. METHOD: This prospective observational study consecutively enrolled 105 hospitalized participants with COVID-19 at 2 tertiary care centers. Ultrasound was performed in 12 lung zones within 24 hours of admission. Findings were assessed relative to 4 outcomes: intensive care unit (ICU) need, need for intensive respiratory support, length of stay, and death. RESULTS: We detected abnormalities in 92% (97/105) of participants. The common findings were confluent B-lines (92%), non-homogenous pleural lines (78%), and consolidations (54%). Large confluent B-lines, consolidations, bilateral involvement, and any abnormality in ≥ 6 areas were associated with a longer hospitalization and need for intensive respiratory support. Large confluent B-lines and bilateral involvement were also associated with ICU stay. A total lung ultrasound score <5 had a negative predictive value of 100% for the need of intensive respiratory support. A higher total lung ultrasound score was associated with ICU need (median total 18 in the ICU group vs. 11 non-ICU, p = 0.004), a hospitalization ≥ 9d (15 vs 10, p = 0.016) and need for intensive respiratory support (18 vs. 8.5, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had lung ultrasound abnormalities on admission and a higher lung ultrasound score was associated with worse clinical outcomes except death. A low total lung ultrasound score (<5) had a negative predictive value of 100% for the need of intensive respiratory support.

Telemedicine clinics (teleclinics) have been introduced for cancer patients to reduce the risk of horizontal transmission at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital and The Royal Free Hospital in London. Teleclinics have become routine in many specialities; however, inclusion in oncology care was not standard prior to the pandemic. A mixed-methods survey was designed and delivered to cancer patients (n = 106) at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital and The Royal Free Hospital who had transitioned to teleclinics in March 2020. The survey explored patients’ perceptions of this format. In total, 96 (90.5%) patients consented to take part, across a range of tumour types. Overall, respondents reacted favourably to the format of the teleclinics, with 90.6% of respondents (87/96) stating they would utilise teleclinics beyond the pandemic. Additionally, a survey was distributed to clinicians delivering these teleclinics (n = 16) to explore previous training in, perceptions of, and lessons learned from the introduction of telemedicine. Results suggest patients are accepting of teleclinic use for most clinical purposes. Teleclinic implementation affords benefits to cancer patient care both during and after COVID-19, but there is an urgent need for telemedicine education in oncology specialty training.

The current pandemic has increased pressure on healthcare systems around the world, leading to medical professionals using high-grade PPE for prolonged durations, resulting in device-induced skin injuries. This study focuses on computationally improving the interaction between skin and PPE to reduce the likelihood of discomfort and tissue damage. A finite element model is developed to simulate the movement of PPE against the face during day-to-day tasks. Due to limited available data on skin characteristics and how these vary interpersonally between sexes, races and ages, the main objective of this study was to establish the effects and trends that mask modifications have on the resulting subsurface strain energy density distribution in the skin. These modifications include the material, geometric and interfacial properties. Overall, the results show that skin injury can be reduced by using softer mask materials, whilst friction against the skin should be minimised, e.g. through use of micro-textures, humidity control and topical creams. Furthermore, the contact area between the mask and skin should be maximised, whilst the use of soft materials with incompressible behaviour (e.g. many elastomers) should be avoided.","Jobanputra, Rikeen D.; Hayes, Jack; Royyuru, Sravani; Masen, Marc A.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95861-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34376802/,15

Crystal structures of human and bacterial FAN1 bound to a DNA flap have been solved. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial FAN1 and human FAN1 (hFAN1) missing a flexible loop are monomeric, while intact hFAN1 is homo-dimeric in structure. Importantly, the monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 exhibit very different DNA binding modes. Here, we interrogate the functional differences between monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 and provide an explanation for the discrepancy in oligomeric state between the two hFAN1 structures. Specifically, we show that the flexible loop in question is needed for hFAN1 dimerization. While monomeric and dimeric bacterial or human FAN1 proteins cleave a short 5′ flap strand with similar efficiency, optimal cleavage of a long 5′ flap strand is contingent upon protein dimerization. Our study therefore furnishes biochemical evidence for a role of hFAN1 homodimerization in biological processes that involve 5′ DNA Flap cleavage.","Rao, Timsi; Longerich, Simonne; Zhao, Weixing; Aihara, Hideki; Sung, Patrick; Xiong, Yong",DNA Repair (Amst),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568786417304160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29518739/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568786417304160; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dnarep.2018.02.007,15

There are similarities in these persistent complications between SARS-CoV-2 and the Ebola, Zika, and influenza A viruses. Normal CNS neuronal mitochondrial function requires high oxygen levels for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. Recent studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can hijack mitochondrial function. Persistent changes in cognitive functioning have also been reported with other viral infections. SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in long-term effects on immune processes within the CNS by causing microglial dysfunction. This short opinion aims to discuss the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of long-term neuropsychiatric COVID-19 involves microglia, mitochondria, and persistent neuroinflammation.","Stefano, George B.; Büttiker, Pascal; Weissenberger, Simon; Martin, Anders; Ptacek, Radek; Kream, Richard M.",Med Sci Monit,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.933015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016942/,15

Apart from ARDS, clinical reports have shown noticeable cardiovascular complications among the patients of COVID-19. Infection from virus, stimulation of cytokine storm, altered immune response, and damage to myocardial tissue are some of the proposed mechanisms of cardiovascular complications in COVID-19. Areas covered: Based on the clinical reports of CVDs among COVID-19 patients, we have discussed the molecular mechanisms involved in cardiovascular pathogenesis, its prevalence, and association with COVID-19, and various available therapeutic modality for the treatment. Expert opinion: Seeing the cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients and its association with the existing drug, risk–benefit ratio of treatment paradigm, as well as the level of cardiac injury biomarkers must be monitored regularly. Additionally, a well-designed clinical trial should be conducted where head to head comparison can be made with anti-COVID-19 drugs and cardioprotective anti-inflammatory drugs. Nevertheless, vaccines are the best-suited approach, but until then, sanitization, social distancing, and active lifestyle are the best ways to beat this global pandemic situation.","Iqubal, Ashif; Iqubal, Mohammad Kashif; Hoda, Farazul; Najmi, Abul Kalam; Haque, Syed Ehtaishamul",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2021.1893692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33618607/,15

However, incidence might be affected by lower testing rates among vulnerable populations. We aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence, disease severity, and neutralising antibody activity after infection among people with and without HIV receiving care in a county hospital system over a 3-month period. METHODS: In this matched case-control observational study, remnant serum samples were collected between Aug 1 and Oct 31, 2020, from all people living with HIV who underwent routine outpatient laboratory testing in a municipal health-care system (San Francisco General Hospital, CA, USA). Samples from people living with HIV were date of collection-matched (same day) and age-matched (±5 years) to samples from randomly selected adults (aged 18 years or older) without HIV receiving care for chronic conditions at the same hospital. We compared seroprevalence by HIV status via mixed-effects logistic regression models, accounting for the matched structure of the data (random effects for the matched group), adjusting for age, sex, race or ethnicity, and clinical factors (ie, history of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, and type 2 diabetes). Severe COVID-19 was assessed in participants with past SARS-CoV-2 (IgG or PCR) infection by chart review and compared with multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex. SARS-CoV-2 IgG, neutralising antibody titres, and antibody avidity were measured in serum of participants with previous positive PCR tests and compared with multivariable mixed-effects models, adjusting for age, sex, and time since PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. FINDINGS: 1138 samples from 955 people living with HIV and 1118 samples from 1062 people without HIV were tested. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence was 3·7% (95% CI 2·4 to 5·0) among people with HIV compared with 7·4% (5·7 to 9·2) among people without HIV (adjusted odds ratio 0·50, 95% CI 0·30 to 0·83). Among 31 people with HIV and 70 people without HIV who had evidence of past infection, the odds of severe COVID-19 were 5·52 (95% CI 1·01 to 64·48) times higher among people living with HIV. Adjusting for time since PCR-confirmed infection, SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations were lower (percentage change −53%, 95% CI −4 to −76), pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres were lower (−67%, −25 to −86), and avidity was similar (7%, −73 to 87) among people living with HIV compared with those without HIV. INTERPRETATION: Although fewer infections were detected by SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing among people living with HIV than among those without HIV, people with HIV had more cases of severe COVID-19. Among people living with HIV with past SARS-CoV-2 infection, lower IgG concentrations and pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres might reflect a diminished serological response to infection, and the similar avidity could be driven by similar time since infection.

In this study, a near full-length genome sequence of a virus named RS3X (formerly classified as bovine rhinovirus type 1), isolated from infected cattle from the UK in the 1960s, was obtained and analyzed. Compared to other closely related Aphthoviruses, major differences were detected in the leader protease (L(pro)), P1, 2B, and 3A proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RS3X was a member of the species bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV). Using different codon-based and branch-site selection models for Aphthoviruses, including BRAV RS3X and foot-and-mouth disease virus, we observed no clear evidence for genomic regions undergoing positive selection. However, within each of the BRV species, multiple sites under positive selection were detected. The results also suggest that the probability (determined by Recombination Detection Program) for recombination events between BRVs and other Aphthoviruses, including foot-and-mouth disease virus was not significant. In contrast, within BRVs, the probability of recombination increases.

Understanding these indirect health effects is important in informing strategies to mitigate against them. This paper presents an analysis of the indirect health effects of the pandemic in Kenya. METHODS: We employed a mixed-methods approach, combining the analysis of secondary quantitative data obtained from the Kenya Health Information System database (from January 2019 to November 2020) and a qualitative inquiry involving key informant interviews (n = 12) and document reviews. Quantitative data were analysed using an interrupted time series analysis (using March 2020 as the intervention period). Thematic analysis approach was employed to analyse qualitative data. RESULTS: Quantitative findings show mixed findings, with statistically significant reduction in inpatient utilization, and increase in the number of sexual violence cases per OPD visit that could be attributed to COVID-19 and its mitigation measures. Key informants reported that while financing of essential health services and domestic supply chains were not affected, international supply chains, health workforce, health infrastructure, service provision, and patient access were disrupted. However, the negative effects were thought to be transient, with mitigation measures leading to a bounce back. CONCLUSION: Finding from this study provide some insights into the effects of the pandemic and its mitigation measures in Kenya. The analysis emphasizes the value of strategies to minimize these undesired effects, and the critical role that routine health system data can play in monitoring continuity of service delivery.","Barasa, Edwine; Kazungu, Jacob; Orangi, Stacey; Kabia, Evelyn; Ogero, Morris; Kasera, Kadondi",BMC Health Serv Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06726-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34311716/,15

Not only the rate and pattern of contagion that threaten our sense of healthy living but also the safety measures put in place for containing the spread of the virus may require social distancing. Three different measures to counteract this pandemic situation have emerged, namely: i) vaccination, ii) herd immunity development, and iii) lockdown. As the first measure is not ready at this stage and the second measure is largely considered unreasonable on the account of the gigantic number of fatalities, a vast majority of countries have practiced the third option despite having a potentially immense adverse economic impact. To mitigate such an impact, this paper proposes a data-driven dynamic clustering framework for moderating the adverse economic impact of COVID-19 flare-up. Through an intelligent fusion of healthcare and simulated mobility data, we model lockdown as a clustering problem and design a dynamic clustering algorithm for localized lockdown by taking into account the pandemic, economic and mobility aspects. We then validate the proposed algorithms by conducting extensive simulations using the Malaysian context as a case study. The findings signify the promises of dynamic clustering for lockdown coverage reduction, reduced economic loss, and military unit deployment reduction, as well as assess potential impact of uncooperative civilians on the contamination rate. The outcome of this work is anticipated to pave a way for significantly reducing the severe economic impact of the COVID-19 spreading.

638268,Broad-spectrum coronavirus antiviral drug discovery,2019-03-08,"Rapid and sensitive detection of human pathogens, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an urgent and challenging task for clinical laboratories. Currently, the gold standard test for SARS-CoV-2-specific ribonucleic acid (RNA) is based on reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), which relies on target amplification by Taq polymerase and uses a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based hydrolysis probe. Although this method is accurate and specific, it is also time consuming. To rapidly detect the presence of the viral RNA in clinical samples, we describe a new molecular assay that combines a highly sensitive magnetic modulation biosensing (MMB) system, rapid thermal cycling, and a modified double-quenched hydrolysis probe. Using in vitro transcribed SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets spiked in PCR-grade water, we found that the calculated limit of detection of the MMB-based molecular assay was 1.6 copies per reaction. Testing 309 RNA extracts from 170 confirmed RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals (30 of which are positive to other respiratory viruses) and 139 RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2-positive patients ([Formula: see text]) resulted in 97.8% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 0% cross-reactivity. The total turnaround time of the MMB-based assay is 30 minutes, which is 3–4 times faster than a standard RT-qPCR.

However, the use of bee venom has shown adverse effects. Therefore, there is a need for research that can remove the cytotoxicity of bee venom and enhance its efficacy. In this study, we hydrolyzed melittin, the main component of bee venom, and removed the other components to eliminate the toxicity of bee venom. To compare the efficacy of bee venom and detoxified bee venom, we examined their antioxidant effects using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. In addition, cytotoxicity was confirmed in MCF 10A and RAW 264.7 cells, using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay. Detoxified bee venom showed a strong antioxidant activity and decreased a cytotoxicity in MCF 10A and RAW 264.7 cells. The anti-inflammatory activity of detoxified bee venom and bee venom were assessed by comparison of the expression of inflammatory cytokine mRNA and phosphorylation of IκBα in RAW 264.7 cells. Degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells was analyzed through β-hexosaminidase release assay to confirm the allergenic activity of bee venom and detoxified bee venom. Treatment of the detoxified bee venom inhibited inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression, IκBα phosphorylation, and β-hexosaminidase release. Taken together, the results indicated that compared to bee venom, detoxified bee venom exhibited decreased cytotoxicity and allergenicity and increased anti-inflammatory activity. In conclusion, detoxification of bee venom efficiently decreases the adverse effects, making it suitable for medicinal applications.

The full extent of infection of MERS-CoV is not clear, nor is the extent and/or role of asymptomatic infections in transmission. We conducted a review of molecular and serological investigations through PubMed and EMBASE from September 2012 to November 15, 2018, to measure subclinical or asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection within and outside of health-care settings. We performed retrospective analysis of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections reported to the World Health Organization to November 27, 2018, to summarize what is known about asymptomatic infections identified through national surveillance systems. We identified 23 studies reporting evidence of MERS-CoV infection outside of health-care settings, mainly of camel workers, with seroprevalence ranges of 0%–67% depending on the study location. We identified 20 studies in health-care settings of health-care worker (HCW) and family contacts, of which 11 documented molecular evidence of MERS-CoV infection among asymptomatic contacts. Since 2012, 298 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported as asymptomatic to the World Health Organization, 164 of whom were HCWs. The potential to transmit MERS-CoV to others has been demonstrated in viral-shedding studies of asymptomatic MERS infections. Our results highlight the possibility for onward transmission of MERS-CoV from asymptomatic individuals. Screening of HCW contacts of patients with confirmed MERS-CoV is currently recommended, but systematic screening of non-HCW contacts outside of health-care facilities should be encouraged.","Grant, Rebecca; Malik, Mamunur Rahman; Elkholy, Amgad; Van Kerkhove, Maria D",Epidemiol Rev,https://doi.org/10.1093/epirev/mxz009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31781765/,15

The example of Seba’s short-tailed bat (Carollia perspicillata),2019-09-13,"OBJECTIVES: The rapid diagnosis of acute infections and sepsis remains a serious challenge. As a result of limitations in current diagnostics, guidelines recommend early antimicrobials for suspected sepsis patients to improve outcomes at a cost to antimicrobial stewardship. We aimed to develop and prospectively validate a new, 29-messenger RNA blood-based host-response classifier Inflammatix Bacterial Viral Non-Infected version 2 (IMX-BVN-2) to determine the likelihood of bacterial and viral infections. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Emergency Department, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charité—Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany. PATIENTS: Three hundred twelve adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute infections or sepsis with at least one vital sign change. INTERVENTIONS: None (observational study only). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gene expression levels from extracted whole blood RNA was quantified on a NanoString nCounter SPRINT (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA). Two predicted probability scores for the presence of bacterial and viral infection were calculated using the IMX-BVN-2 neural network classifier, which was trained on an independent development set. The IMX-BVN-2 bacterial score showed an area under the receiver operating curve for adjudicated bacterial versus ruled out bacterial infection of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85–0.95) compared with 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84–0.94) for procalcitonin with procalcitonin being used in the adjudication. The IMX-BVN-2 viral score area under the receiver operating curve for adjudicated versus ruled out viral infection was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.77–0.89). CONCLUSIONS: IMX-BVN-2 demonstrated accuracy for detecting both viral infections and bacterial infections. This shows the potential of host-response tests as a novel and practical approach for determining the causes of infections, which could improve patient outcomes while upholding antimicrobial stewardship.","Bauer, Wolfgang; Kappert, Kai; Galtung, Noa; Lehmann, Dana; Wacker, James; Cheng, Henry K.; Liesenfeld, Oliver; Buturovic, Ljubomir; Luethy, Roland; Sweeney, Timothy E.; Tauber, Rudolf; Somasundaram, Rajan",Crit Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34166284/,15
640775,AI-based language models powering drug discovery and development,2021,"Air pollution is a critical risk factor for the prevalence of COVID-19. However, few studies have focused on whether air pollution affects the efficacy of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. To better guide the knowledge surrounding this vaccination, we conducted a cross-section study to identify the relationships between air pollutant exposure and plasma neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero cell, CoronaVac, SINOVΛC, China). We recruited 239 healthcare workers aged 21–50 years who worked at Suining Central Hospital. Of these, 207 were included in this study, depending on vaccination date. The data regarding air pollutants were collected to calculate individual daily exposure dose (DED). The geometric mean of all six pollutant DEDs was applied to estimate the combined toxic effects (DED(complex)). Then, the participants were divided into two groups based on the mean value of DED(complex). The median plasma NAb titer was 12.81 AU/mL, with 85.99% vaccine efficacy in healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2. In exposure group, observations included lower plasma NAb titers (median: 11.13 AU/mL vs. 14.56 AU/mL), more peripheral counts of white blood cells and monocytes (mean: 6.71 × 10(9)/L vs. 6.29 × 10(9)/L and 0.49 × 10(9)/L vs. 0.40 × 10(9)/L, respectively), and a higher peripheral monocyte ratio (7.38% vs. 6.50%) as compared to the reference group. In addition, elevated air pollutant DEDs were associated with decreased plasma NAb titers. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the relationship between air pollutant exposure and plasma NAb titers of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. This suggests that long-term exposure to air pollutants may inhibit plasma NAb expression by inducing chronic inflammation. Therefore, to achieve early herd immunity and hopefully curb the COVID-19 epidemic, vaccinations should be administered promptly to those eligible, and environmental factors should be considered as well.

641027,Viral Diseases by Domestic Animal Species,2014-06-27,"PURPOSE: Health applications are employed to aid patients with chronic diseases in effective long-term disease management. This investigation aims to measure the utilization of health applications among patients diagnosed with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional investigation was conducted in the Jazan region in Saudi Arabia between October 2020 and March 2021. Data were collected during interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. The questionnaire collected items about the patients’ demographics, morbidity, and use of electronic devices and health applications developed by the Saudi MoH. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with odds of reporting use of applications. RESULTS: A total of 658 patients were recruited. The mean age of the patients was 51 years, and 59% of them were females. The most frequently reported diagnosed condition was diabetes (53.5%), followed by hypertension (42.7%). Majority of the patients reported not using any health applications developed by the Saudi MoH (68.2%). Patients with higher educational levels and younger patients were more likely to report use of the applications (ORs: 4.2, 2.6 respectively). Comorbidity history and disease duration did not seem to influence the probability of reporting use of health applications (P-values >0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients diagnosed with chronic diseases in Jazan had low utilization of health applications developed by the Saudi MoH. This indicates a need to encourage the use of these health applications, particularly among patients with chronic diseases and to consider use restriction among older patients with lower educational levels.","Alharbi, Ruwaym; Qadri, Alanood; Mahnashi, Mashael; Hakami, Alshomokh; Darraj, Bushra; Shnaimer, Jubran; Gosadi, Ibrahim",Patient Prefer Adherence,https://doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s329891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34556976/,15
641069,Clinicopathological Features of Globoid Cell Leucodystrophy in Cats,2005-05-31,"Currently, the utility of white blood cell count (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), for diagnosis of fracture-related infection (FRI), is still controversial, and potential efficiency of interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a novel cytokine in assisted diagnosis of FRI remains unclear. This study is aimed at investigating the utility and potential influencing factors of IL-6 and the common biomarkers for diagnosing FRI. Preoperative serological levels of IL-6 and the three biomarkers were compared between 407 FRI patients and 195 fracture-healed (FH) patients. Diagnostic efficiency of the indicators was evaluated using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and their potential influencing factors were also analyzed. Outcomes showed that the median levels of all of the four biomarkers were significantly higher among the FRI patients than those among the FH patients (P < 0.01). The areas below the ROC curves of ESR, CRP, and IL-6 were 76.5%, 76.4%, and 71.8%, respectively, with WBC of only 56.9%. Compared with ESR and CRP, IL-6 displayed a lower sensitivity (ESR vs. CRP vs. IL − 6 = 72.7% vs. 65.6% vs. 57.5%) but a higher specificity (ESR vs. CRP vs. IL − 6 = 70.3% vs. 75.4% vs. 83.6%). Serological IL-6 level was influenced by pathogen culture result and pathogen number; nonetheless, bacteria type appeared to have no influence on the levels of the four biomarkers. In short, this study displayed similar value of IL-6 with that of ESR and CRP in assisted diagnosis of FRI. Whether IL-6 can be regarded as a promising diagnostic indicator requires more studies.","Zhao, Xing-qi; Wan, Hao-yang; Qin, Han-jun; Jiang, Nan; Yu, Bin",J Immunol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34595243/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/1461638,15
641355,Pathogen-specific risk factors in acute outbreaks of respiratory disease in calves,2020-01-15,"BACKGROUND: Fatty liver disease (FLD) arises from the accumulation of fat in the liver and may cause liver inflammation, which, if not well controlled, may develop into liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, or even hepatocellular carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: We describe the construction of machine-learning models for current-visit prediction (CVP), which can help physicians obtain more information for accurate diagnosis, and next-visit prediction (NVP), which can help physicians provide potential high-risk patients with advice to effectively prevent FLD. METHODS: The large-scale and high-dimensional dataset used in this study comes from Taipei MJ Health Research Foundation in Taiwan. We used one-pass ranking and sequential forward selection (SFS) for feature selection in FLD prediction. For CVP, we explored multiple models, including k-nearest-neighbor classifier (KNNC), Adaboost, support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), Gaussian naïve Bayes (GNB), decision trees C4.5 (C4.5), and classification and regression trees (CART). For NVP, we used long short-term memory (LSTM) and several of its variants as sequence classifiers that use various input sets for prediction. Model performance was evaluated based on two criteria: the accuracy of the test set and the intersection over union/coverage between the features selected by one-pass ranking/SFS and by domain experts. The accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated for both CVP and NVP for males and females, respectively. RESULTS: After data cleaning, the dataset included 34,856 and 31,394 unique visits respectively for males and females for the period 2009-2016. The test accuracy of CVP using KNNC, Adaboost, SVM, LR, RF, GNB, C4.5, and CART was respectively 84.28%, 83.84%, 82.22%, 82.21%, 76.03%, 75.78%, and 75.53%. The test accuracy of NVP using LSTM, bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM), Stack-LSTM, Stack-biLSTM, and Attention-LSTM was respectively 76.54%, 76.66%, 77.23%, 76.84%, and 77.31% for fixed-interval features, and was 79.29%, 79.12%, 79.32%, 79.29%, and 78.36%, respectively, for variable-interval features. CONCLUSIONS: This study explored a large-scale FLD dataset with high dimensionality. We developed FLD prediction models for CVP and NVP. We also implemented efficient feature selection schemes for current- and next-visit prediction to compare the automatically selected features with expert-selected features. In particular, NVP emerged as more valuable from the viewpoint of preventive medicine. For NVP, we propose use of feature set 2 (with variable intervals), which is more compact and flexible. We have also tested several variants of LSTM in combination with two feature sets to identify the best match for male and female FLD prediction. More specifically, the best model for males was Stack-LSTM using feature set 2 (with 79.32% accuracy), whereas the best model for females was LSTM using feature set 1 (with 81.90% accuracy).","Wu, Cheng-Tse; Chu, Ta-Wei; Jang, Jyh-Shing Roger",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34387552/; https://doi.org/10.2196/26398,15

To address this implementation gap, we developed the ‘RESOLVE Implementation Strategy’. This protocol describes a process evaluation to explore mechanisms through which this strategy does, or does not, support the implementation of outcome measures in routine palliative care practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Multistrand, mixed-methods process evaluation. Strand one will collect routine outcomes data (palliative Phase of Illness, Integrated Palliative care Outcomes Scale, Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Status) to map the changes in use of outcome measures over 12 months (July 2021–July 2022). Strand two will collect survey data over the same 12-month period to explore how professionals’ understandings of, skills in using and ability to build organisational practices around, outcome measures change over time. Strand three will collect interview data to understand the mechanisms underpinning/affecting our implementation strategy. Thematic framework analysis and descriptive statistics will be used to analyse qualitative and quantitative data, respectively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: For strand one, ethical approval has been obtained (Cambridge REC, REF: 20/EE/0188). For strands two and three, ethical approval has been obtained from Hull York Medical School ethics committee (2105). Tailored feedback of study findings will be provided to participating sites. Abstracts and papers will be submitted to national/international conferences and peer-reviewed journals.

641538,Recent Advances in Extracellular Vesicles as Drug Delivery Systems and Their Potential in Precision Medicine,2020-10-22,"Intercellular tight junctions define epithelial apicobasal polarity and form a physical fence which protects underlying tissues from pathogen invasions. PALS1, a tight junction-associated protein, is a member of the CRUMBS3-PALS1-PATJ polarity complex, which is crucial for the establishment and maintenance of epithelial polarity in mammals. Here we report that the carboxy-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV E small envelope protein (E) binds to human PALS1. Using coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays, we show that E interacts with PALS1 in mammalian cells and further demonstrate that the last four carboxy-terminal amino acids of E form a novel PDZ-binding motif that binds to PALS1 PDZ domain. PALS1 redistributes to the ERGIC/Golgi region, where E accumulates, in SARS-CoV–infected Vero E6 cells. Ectopic expression of E in MDCKII epithelial cells significantly alters cyst morphogenesis and, furthermore, delays formation of tight junctions, affects polarity, and modifies the subcellular distribution of PALS1, in a PDZ-binding motif-dependent manner. We speculate that hijacking of PALS1 by SARS-CoV E plays a determinant role in the disruption of the lung epithelium in SARS patients.","Teoh, Kim-Tat; Siu, Yu-Lam; Chan, Wing-Lim; Schlüter, Marc A.; Liu, Chia-Jen; Peiris, J.

METHODS: The study was conducted in four PHC centers and two test sites in Mallorca, Spain. Consecutive patients older than 18 years, attending the sites for RT-PCR testing were included. Two nasopharyngeal samples were collected, one for RT-PCR and the other was processed on-site using the Panbio™ rapid antigen test kit for SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated using RT-PCR as the reference, and the predictive values using the pretest probability results for each analyzed group. FINDINGS: A total of 1369 participants were included; mean age 42.5 ± 14.9 years and 54.3% women. The overall prevalence was 10.2%. Most participants (70.6%) presented within 5 days of the onset of symptoms. The overall sensitivity was of 71.4% (95% CI: 63.1%, 78.7%), the specificity of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.4%, 99.9%), the positive predictive value of 98.0% (95% CI: 93.0%, 99.7%) and a negative predictive value of 96.8% (95% CI: 95.7%, 97.7%). The sensitivity was higher in symptomatic patients, in those arriving within 5 days since symptom onset and in those with high viral load.

DESIGN AND SETTING: This is an explanatory qualitative study exploring the institutional capacity of resilience in Myanmar’s health system. Analysis proceeded using a data-driven thematic analysis closely following the framework method. This process enabled comparisons and contrasts of key emergent themes between the participants, which later generated key results describing the foundational assets, barriers and opportunities for achieving resilience in Myanmar. PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised of 12 in-depth interviews conducted with representatives from international organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The inclusion criteria to recruiting the participants were that they had directly been a part of the Cyclone Nargis response at the time. There was a balanced distribution of participants across UN, bilateral and NGOs, and most of them were either Myanmar citizens or expatriates with extensive working experience based in Myanmar. RESULTS: Key findings elucidate the characteristics of resilience that have been salient or absent in Myanmar’s response to Cyclone Nargis. Strong social capital and motivation propelled by its deep-rooted culture and religion served as Myanmar’s greatest assets that filled major gaps in the system. Meanwhile, its postcolonial and military legacy posed barriers towards investing in building its long-term foundations towards resilience. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that resilience in the health system can be built through strategic investments towards building the foundations of resilience to better prepare for future shocks. In the case of Myanmar, social capital and motivation, which surfaced as its foundational assets, can be channelled into opportunities that can help achieve its long-term health goals, accelerating its journey towards resilience in the health system.","Grimm, Pauline Yongeun; Merten, Sonja; Wyss, Kaspar",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34551949/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050700,15

A cross-sectional study was conducted over Menoufia University academic staff members in Egypt. The participants were chosen from both practical and theoretical colleges in Menoufia University using a multistage random sample. Tarfadar technostress questionnaire was used. Cortisol blood level was measured for all participants. This study included 142 participants. The mean age of the group was 36.32±6.41 years. 52.1 percent worked in practical colleges, and 60.6% were lecturers or higher. Their mean cortisol level was 15.61±7.07mcg/dl. Participants who were females, reside in rural areas, held a lecturer or higher position, had poor work-environment WiFi, and lacked technical training had significantly higher levels of technostress subscales. Most of the technostress subscales were significantly correlated with age and blood cortisol levels. The predictors of work overload in multivariate regression were female gender and a work environment with poor WiFi. Female gender, theoretical colleges, being lecturer or higher, and poor WiFi were the predictors for invasion. Among university staff members, technostress was found to be evident.

Videoconferencing psychotherapy has become a fundamental mode of treatment for people with alcohol use disorders. However, there are still doubts about its effectiveness and the therapeutic relationship. The working alliance is considered a foundation of effective practice in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Observer measurements of the working alliance have demonstrated reliability and meaningful associations with the reduction of symptoms. However, translations of instruments to evaluate the working alliance and examine its construct have not previously been conducted for online psychotherapy for alcohol addiction. This study aimed for the cross-cultural adaptation of the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form-Observer (WAI-SR-O) for Brazil and the evaluation of its reliability and evidence of its validity in videoconferencing psychotherapy for alcoholism. The WAI-SR-O was applied by pairs of observers for the evaluation of the working alliance in 19 recorded sessions of videoconferencing psychotherapy of 10 clients with a diagnosis of alcohol addiction. The sessions were also evaluated by the therapist (WAI-T) and client (WAI-C). The WAI-SR-O shows a moderate inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC = 0.67) for the general scale, higher ICC for the goals and bond subscales, and a moderate value for the task subscale. The internal consistency was good (a = 0.86). The results show low but significant correlations among the goals and bond subscales of the WAI-SR-O and the general, goals, and bond scales of the WAI-T. No correlations were found with the WAI-C. As the literature points out, the client, therapist, and observer versions of the WAI evaluated the alliance differently, requiring further study.

However, few data exist to guide axillary surgery following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET). Therefore, we evaluated the extent and outcomes of axillary surgery in a contemporary cohort of NET patients, a treatment approach that has become particularly relevant during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified invasive breast cancer patients treated with NET between October 2008 and November 2019. Patients presenting with stage IV disease or recurrent disease were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square, Fisher’s exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. RESULTS: 194 invasive breast cancers in 186 patients (median age 66 years) were evaluated; 81 patients had breast-conserving surgery (BCS), while 113 underwent mastectomy. Eighty-four patients (43.3%) were biopsy-proven cN+ with 4/84 (4.8%) ypN0 following NET. Among cN+ patients, 14 (16.7%) had sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) only, 27 (32.1%) had SLNB + axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and 43 (51.2%) had ALND. Among 110 cN0 patients, 99 had axillary surgery with 28/99 (28.3%) ypN+: SLNB in 83 (75.5%), SLNB+ALND in 14 (12.7%), and ALND in 2 (1.8%). Among all ypN+ patients, 23/108 (21.3%) had SLNB alone: 18/43 (41.9%) of BCS and 5/65 (7.7%) mastectomy patients (p < 0.001). After median follow-up of 35 months, no regional recurrences were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Among biopsy-proven cN+ NET patients, we observed deescalation of axillary surgery in selected patients, despite a low nodal pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, without nodal recurrences. These data suggest that patients with low-volume axillary disease treated with NET may be managed similarly to patients treated with a surgery-first approach.

Therefore, the present study investigated the differences in phobic anxiety between work and leisure activities according to optimistic bias among 533 South Korean citizens. Frequency analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, t-tests, and a one-way analysis of variance were conducted to examine the data. The results showed that for leisure activities, women showed a higher perception of phobic anxiety. In addition, the group showing high optimistic bias had a higher perception of phobic anxiety in both work and leisure activity situations. Therefore, support measures to lower phobic anxiety among women are needed at the government level, while support and interest from family members are needed at home. Moreover, local governments must ensure active involvement to mitigate phobic anxiety among individuals, and measures are needed to more actively implement infectious disease prevention behaviors.","Kim, Young-Jae; Kim, E-Sack",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17228436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33202624/,15

Heparin (H) is frequently used as an anticoagulant in cancer patients but up to 5% of patients have a side effect, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) that can be life-threatening. HIT is developed due to a complex interaction among multiple components including heparin, platelet factor 4 (PF4), HIT antibodies, and platelets. However, available information regarding the effect of HIT components on cancers is limited. Here, we investigated the effect of these materials on the mechanical property of breast cancer cells using atomic force microscopy (AFM) while cell spreading was quantified by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and cell proliferation rate was determined. Over time, we found a clear effect of each component on cell elasticity and cell spreading. In the absence of platelets, HIT antibodies inhibited cell proliferation but they promoted cell proliferation in the presence of platelets. Our results indicate that HIT complexes influenced the development of breast cancer cells.","Chen, Li-Yu; Apte, Gurunath; Lindenbauer, Annerose; Frant, Marion; Nguyen, Thi-Huong",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34440575/; https://doi.org/10.3390/life11080832,15

This risk is further exacerbated by poor health behaviours. In particular, CCSs are less active than non-cancer comparators. Existing interventions aiming to improve physical activity (PA) levels in CCSs are methodologically weak. The aim of this study is to rigorously and systematically develop an evidence-based and theoretically-informed intervention to promote, support, improve and sustain PA levels in CCSs, with the long-term goal of reducing CCSs’ cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The BEing Active after ChildhOod caNcer (BEACON) study involves two workpackages at two National Health Service sites in England, UK. Participants will be CCSs and their parents, and healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in their care. Workpackage one (WP1) will use qualitative methods to explore and understand the barriers and facilitators to PA in CCSs. Two sets of semistructured interviews will be conducted with (1) CCSs (aged 10–24 years) and (2) parents of CCSs. WP2 will use co-design methods to bring together stakeholders (CCSs; their parents; HCPs; researchers) to develop a prototype intervention. Where possible, all data will be audio recorded and transcribed. Data from WP1 will be analysed using a thematic approach. Analysis of WP2 data will involve content analysis, and analysis of formative output and procedures. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by North East-Tyne & Wear South Research Ethics Committee (REC ref: 18/NE/0274). Research findings will be disseminated primarily via national and international conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals. Patient and public involvement will inform further dissemination activities.","Brown, Morven C; Araújo-Soares, Vera; Skinner, Roderick; Glaser, Adam W; Sarwar, Naseem; Saxton, John M; Montague, Kyle; Hall, Jamie; Burns, Olivia; Sharp, Linda",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33371034/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041073,15

This study examined the impact of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and subsequent control measures on gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability among transgender and non-binary people globally. METHODS: We collected global cross-sectional data from 964 transgender and non-binary adult users of the Hornet and Her apps from April to August 2020 to characterize changes in gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted Poisson regression models to assess if access to gender-affirming care and ability to live according to one’s gender were related to depressive symptoms, anxiety, and changes in suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Individuals resided in 76 countries, including Turkey (27.4%,n=264/964) and Thailand (20.6%,n=205). A majority were non-binary (66.8%,n=644) or transfeminine (29.4%,n=283). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 55.0% (n=320/582) reported reduced access to gender-affirming resources, and 38.0% (n=327/860) reported reduced time lived according to their gender. About half screened positive for depression (50.4%,442/877) and anxiety (45.8%,n=392/856). One in six (17.0%,n=112/659) expected losses of health insurance, and 77.0% (n=724/940) expected income reductions. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and increased suicidal ideation were 1.63 (95% CI: 1.36–1.97), 1.61 (95% CI: 1.31–1.97), and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.07–2.82) times higher for individuals whose access to gender-affirming resources was reduced versus not. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced access to gender-affirming resources and the ability of transgender and non-binary people to live according to their gender worldwide. These reductions may drive the increased depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal ideation reported in this sample. To improve transgender and non-binary health globally, increased access to gender-affirming resources should be achieved through policies (e.g., digital prescriptions), flexible interventions (e.g., telehealth), and support for existing transgender health initiatives.","Jarrett, Brooke A.; Peitzmeier, Sarah M.; Restar, Arjee; Adamson, Tyler; Howell, Sean; Baral, Stefan; Beckham, S.

Hence, accurate and cheap portable sensors are crucially important for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as robust synthetic molecular recognition materials with antibody-like ability to bind and discriminate between molecules can perfectly serve in building selective elements in such sensors. Herein, we report for the first time on the development of a MIP-based electrochemical sensor for detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (ncovNP). A key element of the sensor is a disposable sensor chip - thin film electrode - interfaced with a MIP-endowed selectivity for ncovNP and connected with a portable potentiostat. The resulting ncovNP sensor showed a linear response to ncovNP in the lysis buffer up to 111 fM with a detection and quantification limit of 15 fM and 50 fM, respectively. Notably, the sensor was capable of signaling ncovNP presence in nasopharyngeal swab samples of COVID-19 positive patients.

651994,Adenoviruses as vaccine vectors,2016-12-14,"INTRODUCTION: Xylometazoline hydrochloride (HCl) is a nasal decongestant that causes vasoconstriction in the nasal submucosa. It has been used for more than 50 years for the treatment of nasal congestion caused by rhinitis/sinusitis. Iota-carrageenan is effective against a broad variety of respiratory viruses, which are the most common cause of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Therefore, it is used as the active component in the antiviral nasal spray Coldamaris prophylactic (1.2 mg/mL iota-carrageenan in 0.5% NaCl) and other medical device nasal sprays that are approved and marketed in the EU. Recently, we developed a nasal spray formulation containing both xylometazoline HCl (0.05%) and iota-carrageenan (0.12%) that provides decongestion and antiviral protection of the nasal mucosa at the same time. RESULTS: A set of in vitro experiments revealed that the vasoconstrictive properties of xylometazoline HCl and the antiviral effectiveness of iota-carrageenan against human rhinovirus (hRV) 1a, hRV8 and human coronavirus OC43 were maintained in the formulation containing these two compounds. Permeation experiments using bovine nasal mucosa showed that iota-carrageenan had no significant influence on the permeation of xylometazoline HCl. Finally, in the local tolerance and toxicity study, it was shown that the formulation was well tolerated at the application site with no occurrence of erythema or edema in the nostrils of all rabbits or any signs of toxicity in any of the organs and tissues inspected. CONCLUSION: Investigations on compatibility of xylometazoline HCl and iota-carrageenan demonstrated that the substances do not influence each other, allowing both to fulfill their known specific clinical efficacy (xylometazoline HCl) and effectiveness (iota-carrageenan).","Graf, Christine; Bernkop-Schnürch, Andreas; Egyed, Alena; Koller, Christiane; Prieschl-Grassauer, Eva; Morokutti-Kurz, Martina",Int J Gen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30013382/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s167123,15

This review focuses on IL-32, -34 and -37 in the stable vs. unstable plaques from atherosclerotic patients. Dysregulation of the novel cytokines IL-32, -34 and -37 has been discovered in atherosclerotic plaques. IL-32 and -34 are pro-atherogenic and associated with an unstable plaque phenotype; whereas IL-37 is anti-atherogenic and maintains plaque stability. It is speculated that these cytokines may contribute to the explanation for the increased occurrence of atherosclerotic plaque rupture seen in patients with COVID-19 infection. Understanding the roles of these cytokines in atherogenesis may provide future therapeutic perspectives, both in the management of unstable plaque and acute coronary syndrome, and may contribute to our understanding of the COVID-19 cytokine storm.","Law, Ching Chee; Puranik, Rajesh; Fan, Jingchun; Fei, Jian; Hambly, Brett D.; Bao, Shisan",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.630767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422917/,15

For this reason, its trade is critical to many countries in order to fulfil their internal demand and strategic stocks. In this paper, we use complex network analysis tools to study the international wheat trade network and its evolving characteristics for the period 2009–2013. To understand the vulnerability of each country’s dependence on the imports of this crop we have performed different analyses, simulating shocks of varying intensities for the main wheat producers, and observed the population affected by the production drop. As a result, we conclude that globally the network is slightly more resilient than four years previously, although at the same time some developing countries have slipped into a vulnerable situation. We have also analysed the effects of a global shock affecting all major producers, assessing its impact on every country. Some comments on the COVID-19 outbreak and the political decisions taken by governments following the pandemic declaration are included, observing that given their capital-intensive characteristics, no negative effects should currently be expected in the wheat market.

This study examines the effects of COVID-19 on hospital utilisation in a sub-Saharan country, Sierra Leone. METHODS: Mixed-methods study using longitudinal nationwide hospital data (admissions, operations, deliveries and referrals) and qualitative interviews with healthcare workers and patients. Hospital data were compared across quarters (Q) in 2020, with day 1 of Q2 representing the start of the pandemic in Sierra Leone. Admissions are reported in total and disaggregated by sex, service (surgical, medical, maternity and paediatric) and hospital type (government or private non-profit). Referrals in 2020 were compared with 2019 to assess whether any changes were the result of seasonality. Comparisons were performed using Student’s t-test. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: From Q1 to Q2, weekly mean hospital admissions decreased by 14.7% (p=0.005). Larger decreases were seen in male 18.8% than female 12.5% admissions. The largest decreases were in surgical admissions, a 49.8% decrease (p<0.001) and medical admissions, a 28.7% decrease (p=0.002). Paediatric and maternity admissions did not significantly change. Total operations decreased by 13.9% (p<0.001), while caesarean sections and facility-based deliveries showed significant increases: 12.7% (p=0.014) and 7.5% (p=0.03), respectively. In Q3, total admissions remained 13.2% lower (p<0.001) than Q1. Mean weekly referrals were lower in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 compared with 2019, suggesting findings were unlikely to be seasonal. Qualitative analysis identified both supply-side factors, prioritisation of essential services, introduction of COVID-19 services and pausing elective care, and demand-side factors, fear of nosocomial infection and financial hardship. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated a decrease in hospital utilisation during COVID-19, the decrease is less than reported in other countries during COVID-19 and less than reported during the Ebola epidemic.","Sevalie, Stephen; Youkee, Daniel; van Duinen, A J; Bailey, Emma; Bangura, Thaimu; Mangipudi, Sowmya; Mansaray, Esther; Odland, Maria Lisa; Parmar, Divya; Samura, Sorie; van Delft, Diede; Wurie, Haja; Davies, Justine I; Bolkan, H A; Leather, Andrew J M",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34635552/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005988,15

Reducing inappropriately the O(3) precursors emissions can either produce no reduction or increase surface O(3) concentrations. This paper analyzes the weekend-weekday differences of O(3) at 300 rural and 808 urban background stations worldwide from 2005 to 2014, in order to investigate the O(3) weekend effect over time and assess the effectiveness of the precursors emissions control policies for reducing O(3) levels. Data were analyzed with the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen estimator. Rural sites typically did not experience a weekend-weekday effect. In all urban stations, the mean O(3) concentration on the weekend was 12% higher than on weekdays. Between 2005 and 2014, the annual mean of daily O(3) concentrations increased at 74% of urban sites worldwide (+0.41 ppb year(-1)) and decreased in the United Kingdom (- 0.18 ppb year(-1)). Over this time period, emissions of O(3) precursors declined significantly. However, a greater decline in nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) emissions caused an increase in Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) to NO(x) ratios leading to O(3) formation. In France, South Korea and the United Kingdom, most urban stations showed a significant upward trend (+1.15% per year) for O(3) weekend effect. Conversely, in Canada, Germany, Japan, Italy and the United States, the O(3) weekend effect showed a significant downward trend (- 0.26% per year). Further or inappropriate control of anthropogenic emissions in Canada, Southern Europe, Japan, South Korea and the United States might result in increased daily O(3) levels in urban areas.","Sicard, Pierre; Paoletti, Elena; Agathokleous, Evgenios; Araminienė, Valda; Proietti, Chiara; Coulibaly, Fatimatou; De Marco, Alessandra",Environ Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110193; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120310902?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32919964/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120310902,15

Sixty patients (median age 71 y, range 43–97) were identified. Median CIRS was eight (4–20). Patients had indolent CLL (n = 38), had completed (n = 12) or ongoing therapy (n = 10). Forty-six patients (77%) were hospitalized due to severe Covid-19 and 11 were admitted to ICU. Severe Covid-19 was equally distributed across subgroups irrespective of age, gender, BMI, CLL status except CIRS (p < 0.05). Fourteen patients (23%) died; age ≥75 y was the only significant risk factor (p < 0.05, multivariate analysis with limited power). Comparing month 1–6 vs 7–13 of the pandemic, deaths were numerically reduced from 32% to 18%, ICU admission from 37% to 15% whereas hospitalizations remained frequent (86% vs 71%). Seroconversion occurred in 33/40 patients (82%) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detectable at six and 12 months in 17/22 and 8/11 patients, respectively.

However, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on host-cell selenoproteins remains elusive. The present study investigated the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on expression of selenoprotein mRNAs in Vero cells. SARS-CoV-2 triggered an inflammatory response as evidenced by increased IL-6 expression. Of the 25 selenoproteins, SARS-CoV-2 significantly suppressed mRNA expression of ferroptosis-associated GPX4, DNA synthesis-related TXNRD3 and endoplasmic reticulum-resident SELENOF, SELENOK, SELENOM and SELENOS. Computational analysis has predicted an antisense interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TXNRD3 mRNA, which is translated with high efficiency in the lung. Here, we confirmed the predicted SARS-CoV-2/TXNRD3 antisense interaction in vitro using DNA oligonucleotides, providing a plausible mechanism for the observed mRNA knockdown. Inhibition of TXNRD decreases DNA synthesis which is thereby likely to increase the ribonucleotide pool for RNA synthesis and, accordingly, RNA virus production. The present findings provide evidence for a direct inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2 replication on the expression of a specific set of selenoprotein mRNAs, which merits further investigation in the light of established evidence for correlations between dietary selenium status and the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wang, Yijun; Huang, Jinbao; Sun, Yong; Stubbs, David; He, Jun; Li, Weiwei; Wang, Fuming; Liu, Zhirong; Ruzicka, Jan A.; Taylor, Ethan Will; Rayman, Margaret P.; Wan, Xiaochun; Zhang, Jinsong",Food Chem Toxicol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278691521003197; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691521003197?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2021.112286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023458/,15

To facilitate a deeper understanding of the viral biology we developed a capture sequencing methodology to generate SARS-CoV-2 genomic and transcriptome sequences from infected patients. We utilized an oligonucleotide probe-set representing the full-length genome to obtain both genomic and transcriptome (subgenomic open reading frames [ORFs]) sequences from 45 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples with varying viral titers. For samples with higher viral loads (cycle threshold value under 33, based on the CDC qPCR assay) complete genomes were generated. Analysis of junction reads revealed regions of differential transcriptional activity and provided evidence of expression of ORF10. Heterogeneous allelic frequencies along the 20kb ORF1ab gene suggested the presence of a defective interfering viral RNA species subpopulation in one sample. The associated workflow is straightforward, and hybridization-based capture offers an effective and scalable approach for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from patient samples.","Doddapaneni, Harsha; Cregeen, Sara Javornik; Sucgang, Richard; Meng, Qingchang; Qin, Xiang; Avadhanula, Vasanthi; Chao, Hsu; Menon, Vipin; Nicholson, Erin; Henke, David; Piedra, Felipe-Andres; Rajan, Anubama; Momin, Zeineen; Kottapalli, Kavya; Hoffman, Kristi L.; Sedlazeck, Fritz J.; Metcalf, Ginger; Piedra, Pedro A.; Muzny, Donna M.; Petrosino, Joseph F.; Gibbs, Richard A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.11.421057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330863/,15

Sepsis is a time-dependent disease and requires a prompt recognition and a standardized treatment. The Special Issue “New Strategies for Treatment of Sepsis” has been thought to connect the experience of physicians involved in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of sepsis at every stage of disease, from emergency departments to general and intensive wards. The focus will be pointed on new approaches to this syndrome, such as early recognition based on clinical features and biomarkers, management in non-ICUs, non-invasive treatment strategies, including non-antimicrobial agents, and, of course, invasive approaches.

We reviewed available literature to reach an evidenced-based consensus on the expected duration of viral shedding. DESIGN: We queried 4 scholarly repositories and search engines for studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding dynamics by PCR and/or culture available through September 8, 2020. We calculated the pooled median duration of viral RNA shedding from respiratory and fecal sources. RESULTS: The review included 77 studies on SARS-CoV-2. All studies reported PCR-based testing and 12 also included viral culture data. Among 28 studies, the overall pooled median duration of RNA shedding from respiratory sources was 18.4 days (95% CI, 15.5–21.3; I(2) = 98.87%; P < .01). When stratified by disease severity, the pooled median duration of viral RNA shedding from respiratory sources was 19.8 days (95% CI, 16.2–23.5; I(2) = 96.42%; P < .01) among severely ill patients and 17.2 days (95% CI, 14.0–20.5; I(2) = 95.64%; P < .01) in mild-to-moderate illness. Viral RNA was detected up to 92 days after symptom onset. Viable virus was isolated by culture from −6 to 20 days relative to symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-COV-2 RNA shedding can be prolonged, yet high heterogeneity exists. Detection of viral RNA may not correlate with infectivity since available viral culture data suggests shorter durations of shedding of viable virus. Additional data are needed to determine the duration of shedding of viable virus and the implications for risk of transmission.","Fontana, Lauren M.; Villamagna, Angela Holly; Sikka, Monica K.; McGregor, Jessina C.",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2020.1273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33077007/,15

It is found that pairwise conditional correlations among tourism demand for Jeju, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines are not constant but time-varying. Estimated conditional correlations among Jeju and the three Asian countries are negative over some time periods. This implies that the three Asian countries are substitutes for Jeju in certain specific time horizons. The VEC model is used to investigate the short-run and long-run dynamic relationships and the results reveal that Industrial Production Index and real exchange rates had the positive or negative impact on conditional correlations of tourism demand for these destinations.

Flu epidemics occur annually, and there can be pandemics every few years, such as those caused by types H1N1 or H3N2. The main clinical manifestations are respiratory symptoms associated with fever, and complications such as pneumonia can arise. Nasopharyngeal swab and RT-PCR should be performed to confirm the diagnosis, which can yield results for other viruses as well. Treatment is generally symptomatic, reserving neuraminidase inhibitors for the more serious cases. The best preventive measure is annual vaccination of the population at risk.

In this study, we examine whether actual and perceived control of collected data affects the willingness to use an IoT healthcare device. We further measure actual behavior as a result of a risk-benefit trade-off within the framework of privacy calculus theory. Our experiment with N = 209 participants demonstrates that while actual control does not affect the willingness to use IoT in healthcare, people have a higher intention to use an IoT healthcare device when they perceive to be in control of their data. Furthermore, we found that, prior to their decision, individuals weigh perceived risks and anticipated benefits of information disclosure, which demonstrates the potential to apply the privacy calculus in the context of IoT healthcare technology.

The present study examined the relationship between specific beliefs (belief in conspiracy theories, religiosity) and the susceptibility to conjunction errors (CEs) in specific domains. A total of 500 participants was presented with brief scenarios from the domains “coronavirus conspiracy,” “miraculous healing,” and a control condition. Each scenario included one statement about a separate event and a second statement about two joint events co‐occurring. The participants estimated the probability of each statement. Results showed that the number of CEs made in the coronavirus domain was only associated with the belief in conspiracy theories, while general religiosity was only associated with CEs for scenarios describing miraculous healings. The assessed beliefs were not associated with CEs made in the control condition.

IL‐35 functions as a crucial immunosuppressive factor in immune‐mediated diseases, and the predominant mechanism of suppression is its ability to suppress T cell proliferation and effector functions. The pathogenic processes of the non‐cytopathic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection‐related liver diseases are immune‐mediated, including liver damage and viral control. It has been found that IL‐35 is detectable in peripheral CD4(+) T cells in chronic HBV‐infected patients, whereas it is undetectable in healthy individuals. There is growing evidence that cytokine‐mediated immune responses play a pivotal role in determining the clinical outcome during HBV infection.

Recent estimates suggest that the dispersion parameter k for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is on the order of 0.1, which corresponds to about 10% of cases being the source of 80% of infections. To investigate how overdispersion might affect the outcome of various mitigation strategies, we developed an agent-based model with a social network that allows transmission through contact in three sectors: “close” (a small, unchanging group of mutual contacts as might be found in a household), “regular” (a larger, unchanging group as might be found in a workplace or school), and “random” (drawn from the entire model population and not repeated regularly). We assigned individual infectivity from a gamma distribution with dispersion parameter k. We found that when k was low (i.e., greater heterogeneity, more superspreading events), reducing random sector contacts had a far greater impact on the epidemic trajectory than did reducing regular contacts; when k was high (i.e., less heterogeneity, no superspreading events), that difference disappeared. These results suggest that overdispersion of COVID-19 transmission gives the virus an Achilles’ heel: Reducing contacts between people who do not regularly meet would substantially reduce the pandemic, while reducing repeated contacts in defined social groups would be less effective.","Sneppen, Kim; Nielsen, Bjarke Frost; Taylor, Robert J.; Simonsen, Lone",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2016623118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33741734/,15

The simulated wind and static stability are very similar to the observed ones (e.g., Horinouchi et al., 2018; Ando et al., 2020). The simulated thermal tides accelerate an equatorial superrotational flow with a speed of ~90 m s(−1) around the cloud-heating maximum (~65 km). The zonal-flow acceleration rates of 0.2–0.5 m s(−1) Earth day(−1) are produced by both horizontal and vertical momentum fluxes at low latitudes. In the GCM simulation, strong solar heating above the cloud top (>69 km) and infrared heating around the cloud bottom (~50 km) modify the vertical structures of thermal tides and their vertical momentum fluxes, which accelerate zonal flow at 10(3) Pa (~75 km) and 10(4) Pa (~65 km) at the equator and around 10(3) Pa at high latitudes. Below and in the cloud layer, surface topography weakens the zonal-mean zonal flow over the Aphrodite Terra and Maxwell Montes, whereas it enhances the zonal flow in the southern polar region. The high-resolution topography produces stationary fine-scale bow structures at the cloud top and locally modifies the variances in the geographical coordinates (i.e., the activity of unsteady wave components). Over the high mountains, vertical spikes of the vertical wind variance are found, indicating penetrative plumes and gravity waves. Negative momentum flux is also locally enhanced at the cloud top over the equatorial high mountains. In the solar-fixed coordinate system, the variances (i.e., the activity of waves other than thermal tides) of flow are relatively higher on the nightside than on the dayside at the cloud top. Strong dependences of the eddy heat and momentum fluxes on local time are predominant. The local-time variation of the vertical eddy momentum flux is produced by both thermal tides and solar-related, small-scale gravity waves on the nightside.","Yamamoto, Masaru; Ikeda, Kohei; Takahashi, Masaaki",Icarus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2020.114154; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103520304942?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019103520304942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052146/,15

This can involve sub-national redistribution, short-term relocations as well as international migration. In this paper, we combine detailed location data from Facebook measuring the location of approximately 6 million daily active Facebook users in 5km(2) tiles in the UK with census-derived population estimates to measure population mobility and redistribution. We provide time-varying population estimates and assess spatial population changes with respect to population density and four key reference dates in 2020 (First lockdown, End of term, Beginning of term, Christmas). We also show how the timing and magnitude of observed population changes can impact the size of epidemics using a deterministic model of COVID-19 transmission. We estimate that between March 2020 and March 2021, the total population of the UK has declined and we identify important spatial variations in this population change, showing that low-density areas have experienced lower population decreases than urban areas. We estimate that, for the top 10% highest population tiles, the population has decreased by 6.6%. Further, we provide evidence that geographic redistributions of population within the UK coincide with dates of non-pharmaceutical interventions including lockdowns and movement restrictions, as well as seasonal patterns of migration around holiday dates. The methods used in this study reveal significant changes in population distribution at high spatial and temporal resolutions that have not previously been quantified by available demographic surveys in the UK.

Hermeneutic analysis was done to interpret the shared meaning embedded within their experiences and was informed by an occupational justice perspective. Exploring the experience of the participants in using AT yielded four themes, namely, (1) engaging in occupations despite limited opportunities, (2) going to various locations amidst an inaccessible environment, (3) striving towards inclusion in spite of attitudinal barriers, and (4) securing needs in light of unfavourable life conditions. Filipinos with SCI deal with numerous structural and contextual factors in daily life. There has been partial enablement of OJ as they incorporate AT in their daily lives as occupational rights are far from being recognised and respected.

The scope of this review is to give some insight into the role of the most relevant microRNAs in cancer. We will focus on examining their biological role in tumor development while also providing a broad overview of microRNAs as therapeutics. There is a dedicated focus on the different methods available for microRNA delivery in addition to the efforts being made to increase the specificity of these delivery methods. Finally, we discuss the ongoing clinical trials that are using microRNAs for cancer treatment. ABSTRACT: In the last 20 years, the functional roles for miRNAs in gene regulation have been well established. MiRNAs act as regulators in virtually all biological pathways and thus have been implicated in numerous diseases, including cancer. They are particularly relevant in regulating the basic hallmarks of cancer, including apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and invasion. Despite the substantial progress made in identifying the molecular mechanisms driving the deregulation of miRNAs in cancer, the clinical translation of these important molecules to therapy remains in its infancy. The paucity of vehicles available for the safe and efficient delivery of miRNAs and ongoing concerns for toxicity remain major obstacles to clinical application. Novel formulations and the development of new vectors have significantly improved the stability of oligonucleotides, increasing the effectiveness of therapy. Furthermore, the use of specific moieties for delivery in target tissues or cells has increased the specificity of treatment. The use of new technologies has allowed small but important steps toward more specific therapeutic delivery in tumor tissues and cells. Although a long road remains, the path ahead holds great potential. Currently, a few miRNA drugs are under investigation in human clinical trials with promising results ahead.","Romano, Giulia; Acunzo, Mario; Nana-Sinkam, Patrick",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33810332/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13071526,15

Quarantine is overall one of the oldest and most disseminated and, despite its limits, most effective health measures elaborated by mankind. The evidence-based history of medicine and evidence-based modern epidemiology indicate that the implementation of correct quarantine procedures is today still feasible and useful provided that a proactive collaboration is operative among those concerned and that the measures are tailored according to geographical, social, and health conditions.","Conti, A.A.",International Encyclopedia of Public Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123739605003804; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123739605003804,15

In our study, 62 faecal and intestinal samples from pigs with diarrhoea were collected in Guangxi Province, China, during 2017 and 2018. Twelve samples (19.4%, 12/62) were positive for PDCoV. Five complete genomes of PDCoV were then determined, and sequence alignment revealed that the five strains had discontinuous deletions at 400–401 aa in non‐structural protein 2 (NSP2) and 758–760 aa in non‐structural protein 3 (NSP3) compared with the respective proteins in the HKU15‐44 strain. Notably, the CHN‐GX81‐2018 strain contained two insertions in the S gene and 3′‐UTR. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that four strains shared 98.2%–98.4% nucleotide identity with CHN‐AH‐2004 and were classified into a new cluster of China lineage strains, whereas the CHN‐GX81‐2018 strain shared 98.7% nucleotide identity with Vietnam/Binh21/2015 and belonged to the Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage. Recombination analyses revealed that four strains were the result of recombination between CHN‐HB‐2014 and Vietnam/Binh21/2015 strains. This study demonstrated the co‐existence of multiple lineages of PDCoV in China, and our findings will aid the reorganization and evolution of the virus.","Huang, Haixin; Yin, Yanwen; Wang, Wei; Cao, Liang; Sun, Wenchao; Shi, Kaichuang; Lu, Huijun; Jin, Ningyi",Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419393/; https://doi.org/10.1002/vms3.283,15
661607,In silico virtual screening approaches for anti-viral drug discovery,2012-08-04,"This paper introduces two novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for automated detection of COVID-19. The first model, CovidResNet, is inspired by the deep residual network (ResNet) architecture. The second model, CovidDenseNet, exploits the power of densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNet). The proposed networks are designed to provide fast and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 using computed tomography (CT) images for the multi-class and binary classification tasks. The architectures are utilized in a first experimental study on the SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset, which contains 4173 CT images for 210 subjects structured in a subject-wise manner for three different classes. First, we train and test the networks to differentiate COVID-19, non-COVID-19 viral infections, and healthy. Second, we train and test the networks on binary classification with three different scenarios: COVID-19 vs. healthy, COVID-19 vs. other non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia vs. healthy. Our proposed models achieve up to 93.96% accuracy, 99.13% precision, 94% sensitivity, 97.73% specificity, and a 95.80% F1-score for binary classification, and up to 83.89% accuracy, 80.36% precision, 82% sensitivity, 92% specificity, and a 81% F1-score for the three-class classification tasks. The experimental results reveal the validity and effectiveness of the proposed networks in automated COVID-19 detection. The proposed models also outperform the baseline ResNet and DenseNet architectures while being more efficient.","Alshazly, H.; Linse, C.; Abdalla, M.; Barth, E.; Martinetz, T.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.19.21255763; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.19.21255763v1?rss=1,15
661652,Ultrasound-responsive polymer-based drug delivery systems,2021-03-24,"BACKGROUND: Plasma fractionators have implemented many improvements over the past decade directed toward reducing the likelihood of pathogen transmission by purified blood products, yet little has been published attempting to assess the overall impact of these improvements on the probability of safety of the final product. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Safety margins for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), parvovirus B19, and variant form of Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease (vCJD) were calculated for the two fibrin sealants licensed in the United States and for thrombin. These products were selected because their use in a clinical setting is, in most cases, optional, and both were relatively recently approved for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Moreover, thrombin and fibrinogen both undergo two dedicated virus inactivation steps and/or removal steps in accord with the recommendations of regulatory agencies worldwide. Safety margins were determined by comparing the potential maximum viral loads in contaminated units to viral clearance factors, ultimately leading to the calculation of the residual risk per vial. RESULTS: The residual risk of pathogen transmission per vial was calculated to be less than 1 in 10(−15) for HIV, HCV, HBV, and HAV for both fibrinogen and thrombin. Owing to the greater quantities that can be present and its greater thermal stability, the calculated risk for parvovirus transmission was 1 in 500,000 vials for fibrinogen and less than 1 in 10(7) per vial for thrombin. Assuming that vCJD is found to be present in plasma donations, its risk of transmission by these purified and processed plasma derivatives would appear to be very low. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogen safety initiatives implemented by plasma fractionators over the past 10 to 20 years have resulted in products with excellent pathogen safety profiles. Of the agents examined, parvovirus continues to have the lowest calculated margin of safety. Despite this, parvovirus transmissions should be rare. Manufacturers are encouraged to continue exploring processes to further enlarge parvovirus safety margins and to continue exploring ways of eliminating prions.","Horowitz, Bernard; Busch, Michael",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01717.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18466171/,15

METHODS: We use time series analysis with the data from death cause surveillance database of Suzhou from January 2017 to December 2019 to estimate the expected deaths from January to June 2020 and compare these expected deaths with the reported numbers of deaths. RESULTS: After the implementation of epidemic prevention measures in Suzhou in the first 3 months, overall number of all-cause deaths declined for 5.36, 7.54 and 7.02% compared with predicted numbers. The number of deaths from respiratory causes and traffic accidents declined shapely by 30.1 and 26.9%, totally. When quarantine measures were released (April–June), however, the observed numbers of total deaths exceeded the predicted deaths. People aged over 70 accounted for 91.6% of declined death number in respiratory causes and people aged over 60 accounted for 68.0% of declined death number in traffic accidents. Women over the age of 80 benefited the most from respiratory prevention (accounts for 41% of all reductions), whereas women aged over 60 benefited the most from traffic control (44%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the whole population benefited from the epidemic prevention measures especially elderly females.

Texture-based analysis in scope of other pulmonary diseases has been used to screen, monitor, and provide valuable information for several kinds of diagnoses. To differentiate COVID-19 patients from healthy subjects and patients with other pulmonary diseases is crucial. Our goal is to quantify lung modifications in two pulmonary pathologies: COVID-19 and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). For this purpose, we propose the use of a three-dimensional multiscale fuzzy entropy (MFE3D) algorithm. The three groups tested (COVID-19 patients, IPF, and healthy subjects) were found to be statistically different for 9 scale factors ([Formula: see text]). A complexity index (CI) based on the sum of entropy values is used to classify healthy subjects and COVID-19 patients showing an accuracy of [Formula: see text] , a sensitivity of [Formula: see text] , and a specificity of [Formula: see text].

DESIGN: This prospective, observational, clinical study was conducted from February 2016 to March 2017, and follow-up was conducted until the death of dogs or their discharge from the hospital. SETTING: This study was performed at the Small Animal Teaching Hospital. ANIMALS: A total of 31 client-owned dogs (males, 20; females, 11) with ALOC and MGCS score <18 with no restrictions for age, breed, sex, and body weight were included. Dogs that received neuromuscular blocking agents before MGCS score evaluation were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: BIS values were measured using the Covidien BIS Loc 2 Channel OEM module and a pediatric 4 sensor with a bifrontal application pattern. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Minimal databases of initial neurological assessment, blood profiles, and chest and skull radiographs were developed. In addition, MGCS scores and BIS values were recorded. The mean BIS values for mild, moderate, and severe brain injuries were 89.14 ± 6.52, 77.21 ± 9.82, and 50.58 ± 27.04, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed a significantly positive relationship between BIS values and MGCS scores (r = 0.75; P < 0.001).

663579,Genetic Characteristics of Coronaviruses from Korean Bats in 2016,2017-07-19,"CASE SUMMARY: An 8-month-old neutered male domestic shorthair kitten was examined for anorexia, lethargy and palatine ulcers. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was suspected based on a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer and six manifestations of autoimmunity: fever, paronychia, oral ulcers, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Mastocytemia was observed on the blood smear. Although the clinical presentation of this case meets the classification criteria for SLE in humans, tick-borne disease and histopathology evaluation of the oral and cutaneous lesions would have been necessary to support a definite diagnosis of SLE. Baseline ANA titration was performed in two laboratories with conflicting results, which may reflect substrate differences used for the titration, but a false-positive result cannot be excluded. The cat received prednisolone and all clinical and laboratory abnormalities resolved after two months of treatment. Subsequent ANA titers remained positive and were not correlated to the patient’s clinical progression. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: This report describes new findings associated with a presumptive diagnosis of SLE in a kitten, highlighting that SLE may not be ruled out even in young cats and may be associated with mastocytemia. ANA titration is part of the initial diagnostic work-up of SLE but is a non-specific test and discrepancies can be observed between laboratories. The titration of more specific antibodies such as those used in humans would be helpful to diagnose SLE. ANA titration may not correlate with clinical activity of SLE; hence, the interest of an ANA titer follow-up to establish disease control warrants further investigation.","Huvé, Romain; Fontaine, Pascal; Blais, Marie-Claude; Conversy, Bérénice",JFMS Open Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33425372/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2055116920979271,15

Certain antimicrobials are associated with each; sulfonamides are associated with drug- or metabolite-containing calculi when taken in large doses over a long period of time. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a member of the sulfonamide family, is a rare cause of drug-induced calculi. Cases of sulfonamide urolithiasis occurring in patients with known stone disease have rarely been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a patient with a brief history of recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis requiring 2 ureteroscopic procedures whose existing 6 mm lower pole renal stone more than quadrupled in size to form a 4 cm renal staghorn after 4 months of high-dose treatment for Nocardia pneumonia with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. After ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy and basketing of fragments, the stone was found to be predominantly composed of N(4)-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole, a metabolite of sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSION: Stones composed of sulfamethoxazole or its metabolites are rare but have known associated risk factors that should be considered when prescribing this antibiotic. This case report illustrates additional risk factors for consideration, including pre-existing urinary calculi that may serve as a nidus for sulfamethoxazole deposition, and reviews treatment and prevention methods.","Roedel, Megan M.; Nakada, Stephen Y.; Penniston, Kristina L.",BMC Urol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34535099/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12894-021-00894-5,15

Although megakaryocytes are not mentioned as a characteristic histologic finding associated to pulmonary injury, a few studies reveal that their number is increased in diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). In this autopsy study, we have observed a relevant number of pulmonary megakaryocytes in COVID-19 patients dying with acute lung injury (7.61 ± 5.59 megakaryocytes per 25 high-power fields vs. 1.14 ± 0.86 for the control group, p < 0.05). We analyzed samples of 18 patients, most of whom died after prolonged disease and use of mechanical ventilation. Most patients showed advanced DAD and abnormal coagulation parameters with high levels of fibrinogen, D-dimers, and variable thrombocytopenia. For comparison, pulmonary samples from a group of 14 non-COVID-19 patients dying with DAD were reviewed. They showed similar pulmonary histopathologic findings and an increase in the number of megakaryocytes (4 ± 4.17 vs. 1.14 ± 0.86 for the control group, p < 0.05). Megakaryocyte count in the COVID-19 group was greater but did not reach statistical significance (7.61 ± 5.59 vs. 4 ± 4.17, p = 0.063). Regardless of the cause, pulmonary megakaryocytes are increased in patients with DAD. Their high number seen in COVID-19 patients suggests a relation with the thrombotic events so often seen these patients. Since the lung is considered an active site of megakaryopoiesis, a prothrombotic status leading to platelet activation, aggregation and consumption may trigger a compensatory pulmonary response.

Several clinical prediction rules (CPRs) have been developed to help reduce unnecessary prescribing for RTIs, but there is a lack of studies exploring whether or how these CPRs are being used in UK general practice. AIM: To explore UK GPs’ views and experiences with regards to RTI CPRs, and to identify barriers and facilitators to their use in practice. DESIGN & SETTING: A qualitative analysis of interviews with in-hours GPs working in the South and South West of England. METHOD: Semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews were conducted, digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Patient and public involvement representatives contributed to study design and interpretation of findings. RESULTS: Thirty-two GPs were interviewed. Some CPRs were more commonly used than others. Participants used CPRs to facilitate patient—clinician discussion, confirm and support their decision, and document the consultation. GPs also highlighted concerns including lack of time, inability of CPRs to incorporate patient complexity, a shift in focus from the patient during consultations, and limited use in remote consultation (during the COVID-19 pandemic). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need for user-friendly CPRs that are readily integrated into computer systems, and easily embedded into routine practice to complement clinical decision-making. Existing CPRs need to be validated for other populations where demographics and clinical characteristics may differ, as well different settings including remote consultations and self-assessment.","Hounkpatin, Hilda O; Woods, Catherine; Lown, Mark; Stuart, Beth; Leydon, Geraldine M",BJGP open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117015/; https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgpo.2021.0096,15

In this paper, we consider a deterministic epidemic model of four compartments classified based on the health status of the populations of a given country to capture the disease progression. A stochastic extension of the deterministic model is further considered to capture the uncertainty or variation observed in the disease transmissibility. In the case of a deterministic system, the disease-free equilibrium will be globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, otherwise, the disease persists. Using Lyapunov functional methods, we prove that the infected population of the stochastic system tends to zero exponentially almost surely if the basic reproduction number is less than unity. The stochastic system has no interior equilibrium, however, its asymptotic solution is shown to fluctuate around the endemic equilibrium of the deterministic system under some parametric restrictions, implying that the infection persists. A case study with the Covid-19 epidemic data of Spain is presented and various analytical results have been demonstrated. The epidemic curve in Spain clearly shows two waves of infection. The first wave was observed during March-April and the second wave started in the middle of July and not completed yet. A real-time basic reproduction number has been given to illustrate the epidemiological status of Spain throughout the study period.

We hypothesized that trimeric Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) proteins would be suitable candidates to study receptor binding properties of SARS-CoV-1 and -2. Here we created monomeric and trimeric fluorescent RBD proteins, derived from adherent HEK293T, as well as in GnTI-/- mutant cells, to analyze the effect of complex vs high mannose glycosylation on receptor binding. The results demonstrate that trimeric, complex glycosylated proteins are superior in receptor binding compared to monomeric and immaturely glycosylated variants. Although differences in binding to commonly used cell lines were minimal between the different RBD preparations, substantial differences were observed when respiratory tissues of experimental animals were stained. The RBD trimers demonstrated distinct ACE2 expression profiles in bronchiolar ducts and confirmed the higher binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 over SARS-CoV-1. Our results show that complex glycosylated trimeric RBD proteins are attractive to analyze sarbecovirus receptor binding and explore ACE2 expression profiles in tissues.","Bouwman, Kim M.; Tomris, Ilhan; Turner, Hannah L.; van der Woude, Roosmarijn; Shamorkina, Tatiana M.; Bosman, Gerlof P.; Rockx, Barry; Herfst, Sander; Snijder, Joost; Haagmans, Bart L.; Ward, Andrew B.; Boons, Geert-Jan; de Vries, Robert P.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33556147/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009282,15

Here, primary chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells and specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were infected with three pathogenic IBV strains, and it was observed that the TLR7-MYD88 pathway was inhibited but the TLR3-TIRF pathway was activated. After treatment with poly(I:C)-LMW, poly (I:C)-LMW/LyoVec, and Imiquimod, the replication of IBV was significantly suppressed after 24 h. However, treatment with TLR3 pathway inhibitors such as Pepinh-TRIF, celastrol, chloroquine, and BX795 resulted in increased replication of IBV after 36 h. These results also showed that chloroquine and celastrol were most effective inhibitors of the antiviral response at 48 hpi.","Zhu, Jinyan; Xu, Shuang; Li, Xueyan; Wang, Jue; Jiang, Yueqi; Hu, Weichen; Ruan, Wenke",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32524263/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-020-04690-8,15

METHODS: This is a consecutive prospective cohort of 73 patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19. We evaluated the changes in pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and PROMs between 3 and 6 months and then investigated the associations between outcomes (change in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of the lung (DLCO), dyspnea, and quality of life (QOL)) and clinical and radiological features. RESULTS: There was improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), and DLCO between 3 and 6 months by 3.25%, 3.82% and 5.69% respectively; however, there was no difference in PROMs. Reticulation and total CT scores were associated with lower DLCO %-predicted at 6 months (coefficients; −8.7 and −5.3 respectively). The association between radiological scores and DLCO were modified by time, with the degree of association between ground glass and DLCO having decreased markedly over time. There was no association between other predictors and change in dyspnea or QOL over time. CONCLUSIONS: There is improvement in pulmonary function measurements between 3 and 6 months after COVID-19 symptom onset; however, PROMs did not improve. A higher reticulation and total CT score are negatively associated with DLCO, but this association is attenuated over time. Lastly, there is a considerable proportion of patients with unexplained dyspnea at 6 months, motivating further research to identify the underlying mechanisms.","Shah, Aditi S.; Ryu, Min Hyung; Hague, Cameron J; Murphy, Darra T.; Johnston, James C.; Ryerson, Christopher J.; Carlsten, Christopher; Wong, Alyson W.",ERJ Open Res,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00243-2021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522693/,15

Aiming to enroll 3,500 participants age 65 years or older, TOPAZ is one of the largest randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials ever attempted in parkinsonism. The feasibility of TOPAZ is enhanced by its design as a U.S.- wide home-based trial without geographical limits. Participants receive information from multiple sources, including specialty practices, support groups and websites. Conducting TOPAZ in participants’ homes takes advantage of online consent technology, the capacity to confirm diagnosis using telemedicine and the availability of research nursing to provide screening and parenteral therapy in homes.

We proposed that the threat of COVID-19 will increase people’s mental health problems through their on-line aggression toward stigmatized groups accused of spreading the disease and that there might be potential gender differences in such effects. We tested our predictions among a sample of U.S. residents (Study 1) and a large sample of Chinese residents living out of Hubei province (Study 2) during a heightened period of concern about COVID-19, February 2020. Specifically, we measured U.S. residents’ on-line aggressive behaviors toward Chinese people (Study 1) and Chinese non-Hubei residents’ on-line aggressive behaviors toward Hubei residents (Study 2) as well as their neuroticism (Study 1) and mental health states (Study 2). In line with our predictions, both studies showed that perceived infection of COVID-19 can induce on-line aggression toward stigmatized groups, thereby increasing people’s mental health problems. Moreover, the relationship between COVID-19 vulnerability, on-line aggression, and psychosomatic symptoms was more prominent in men than in women.

We assess angiogenesis during early AIT development and the occurrence of the intussusceptive type. For this purpose, we studied AIT development in (a) human arteries with vasculitis in gallbladders with acute cholecystitis and urgent (n = 25) or delayed (n = 20) cholecystectomy, using immunohistochemical techniques and (b) experimentally occluded arterial segments (n = 56), using semithin and ultrathin sections and electron microscopy. The results showed transitory angiogenic phenomena, with formation of an important microvasculature, followed by vessel regression. In addition to the sequential description of angiogenic and regressive findings, we mainly contribute (a) formation of intravascular pillars (hallmarks of intussusception) during angiogenesis and vessel regression and (b) morphological interrelation between endothelial cells (ECs) in the arterial wall and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which adopt a pericytic arrangement and establish peg-and-socket junctions with ECs. In conclusion, angiogenesis and vessel regression play an important role in AIT development in the conditions studied, with participation of intussusceptive angiogenesis during the formation and regression of a provisional microvasculature and with morphologic interrelation between ECs and VSMCs.","Díaz-Flores, Lucio; Gutiérrez, Ricardo; García, Mª Pino; Gayoso, Sara; Carrasco, José Luís; Díaz-Flores, Lucio.; González-Gómez, Miriam; Madrid, Juan Francisco",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33126763/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21218049,15

Cases of H7N9 human infections emerged in eastern China in 2013 and immediately raised pandemic concerns as historically, pandemics were caused by the introduction of new subtypes into immunologically naïve human populations. Highly pathogenic H7N9 cases with severe disease were reported recently, indicating the continuing public health threat and the need for a prophylactic vaccine. Here we review the development of recombinant influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) as vaccines against H7N9 virus. Several approaches to vaccine development are reviewed including the expression of VLPs in mammalian, plant and insect cell expression systems. Although considerable progress has been achieved, including demonstration of safety and immunogenicity of H7N9 VLPs in the human clinical trials, the remaining challenges need to be addressed. These challenges include improvements to the manufacturing processes, as well as enhancements to immunogenicity in order to elicit protective immunity to multiple variants and subtypes of influenza virus.","Pushko, Peter; Tretyakova, Irina",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32397182/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12050518,15

The Trauma Screening Questionnaire, Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Posttraumatic Growth Inventory‐Short Form were utilized. Factors associated with trauma, burnout, and posttraumatic growth were analysed using logistic and multiple regressions. In total, 12 596 completed the survey, and 52.3% worked in COVID‐19 designated hospitals. At the survey’s conclusion in April, 13.3% reported trauma (Trauma ≥ 6), there were moderate degrees of emotional exhaustion, and 4,949 (39.3%) experienced posttraumatic growth. Traumatic response and emotional exhaustion were greater among (i) women (odds ratio [OR]: 1.48, 95% CI 1.12–1.97 P = 0.006; emotional exhaustion OR: 1.30, 95% CI 1.09–1.54, P = 0.003), (ii) critical care units (OR: 1.20, 95% CI 1.06–1.35, P = 0.004; emotional exhaustion OR: 1.23, 95% CI 1.12–1.33, P < 0.001) (iii) COVID‐19 designated hospital (OR: 1.24, 95% CI 1.11–1.38; P < 0.001; emotional exhaustion OR: 1.26, 95% CI 1.17–1.36; P < 0.001) and (iv) COVID‐19‐related departments (OR: 1.16, 95% CI 1.04–1.29, P = 0.006, emotional exhaustion only). To date, this is the first large‐scale study to report the rates of trauma and burnout for nurses during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The study indicates that nurses who identified as women, working in ICUs, COVID‐19 designated hospitals, and departments involved with treating COVID‐19 patients had higher scores in mental health outcomes.

The TAM receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl and MerTK) mediates the non-inflammatory removal of apoptotic cells by phagocytes through the bridging phosphatidylserine-binding molecules Gas6 or Protein S. We show that one such TAM receptor (Axl) is exclusively expressed on mouse airway macrophages, but not interstitial macrophages and other lung leukocytes, under homeostatic conditions and is constitutively ligated to Gas6. Axl expression is potently induced by GM-CSF expressed in the healthy and inflamed airway, and by type I interferon or TLR3 stimulation on human and mouse macrophages, indicating potential involvement of Axl in apoptotic cell removal under inflammatory conditions. Indeed, an absence of Axl does not cause sterile inflammation in health, but leads to exaggerated lung inflammatory disease upon influenza infection. These data imply that Axl allows specific identification of airway macrophages, and that its expression is critical for macrophage functional compartmentalisation in the airspaces or lung interstitium. We propose that this may be a critical feature to prevent excessive inflammation due to secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells that have not been cleared by efferocytosis.","Fujimori, Toshifumi; Grabiec, Aleksander M; Kaur, Manminder; Bell, Thomas J; Fujino, Naoya; Cook, Peter C; Svedberg, Freya R; MacDonald, Andrew S; Maciewicz, Rose A; Singh, Dave; Hussell, Tracy",Mucosal Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1038/mi.2014.129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25603826/,15

However, their characterization is incomplete because prevalence estimates are based on syndromic surveillance data. Here, we address this shortcoming through the analysis of infection rates among individuals tested regularly for respiratory viral infections, irrespective of their symptoms. METHODS: We carried out longitudinal sampling and analysis among 214 individuals enrolled at multiple New York City locations from fall 2016 to spring 2018. We combined personal information with weekly nasal swab collection to investigate the prevalence of 18 respiratory viruses among different age groups and to assess risk factors associated with infection susceptibility. RESULTS: 17.5% of samples were positive for respiratory viruses. Some viruses circulated predominantly during winter, whereas others were found year round. Rhinovirus and coronavirus were most frequently detected. Children registered the highest positivity rates, and adults with daily contacts with children experienced significantly more infections than their counterparts without children. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral infections are widespread among the general population with the majority of individuals presenting multiple infections per year. The observations identify children as the principal source of respiratory infections. These findings motivate further active surveillance and analysis of differences in pathogenicity among respiratory viruses.","Galanti, Marta; Birger, Ruthie; Ud‐Dean, Minhaz; Filip, Ioan; Morita, Haruka; Comito, Devon; Anthony, Simon; Freyer, Greg A.; Ibrahim, Sadiat; Lane, Benjamin; Ligon, Chanel; Rabadan, Raul; Shittu, Atinuke; Tagne, Eudosie; Shaman, Jeffrey",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770641/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12629,15

Some institutions have started to treat these patients showing encouraging results. To shorten procedure times is crucial for the comfort of symptomatic patients receiving respiratory support and to optimize institutional facilities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At our institution, LD-RT is offered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and signs of early cytokine-released syndrome on behalf of a multicenter study. We designed a coordinated process flow starting from the patient transfer to the simulation CT-scan (first-step), to the end of the LD-RT treatment (last step). The times spent on each step of the process flow were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean age of treated patients was 83 (72–91) years-old. The timing parameters of the first 10 consecutive patients were analyzed. Except for the first (dummy run), patients were managed from the first to the last step in a median of 38 min (25–58, SD 10.67). The most time-consuming sub-process was the contouring of the treatment volumes and dosimetry.

EV-D68 is often detected in patient respiratory samples but has also been detected in stool and wastewater, suggesting the potential for both respiratory and enteric routes of transmission. Here, we used a panel of EV-D68 isolates, including a historical pre-2014 isolate and multiple contemporary isolates from AFM outbreak years, to define the dynamics of viral replication and the host response to infection in primary human airway cells and stem cell-derived enteroids. We show that some recent EV-D68 isolates have decreased sensitivity to acid and temperature compared with earlier isolates and that the respiratory, but not intestinal, epithelium induces a robust type III interferon response that restricts infection. Our findings define the differential responses of the respiratory and intestinal epithelium to contemporary EV-D68 isolates and suggest that a subset of isolates have the potential to target both the human airway and gastrointestinal tracts.","Freeman, Megan Culler; Wells, Alexandra I; Ciomperlik-Patton, Jessica; Myerburg, Michael M; Yang, Liheng; Konopka-Anstadt, Jennifer; Coyne, Carolyn B",eLife,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196272/; https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.66687,15

Many health-conscious individuals practice a gluten-free diet, even if they do not have celiac disease. As it is an autoimmune disorder, it is associated with many other autoimmune diseases. We were interested in one skin condition, another autoimmune disorder lichen planus as a correlative factor for celiac disease. The following systematic review may give some clues. We searched online resources including PubMed, PubMed Central, Cochrane library, and Google scholar for systematic reviews, traditional reviews, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analysis on celiac disease and lichen planus. We included human studies published in peer-reviewed journals in the English language. After reviewing 2389 initial results of our search, we excluded 1250 duplicates, 1108 abstracts, 42 irrelevant articles. We assessed the remaining 26 articles for their quality using various quality assessment tools. After the quality assessment, we included nine final articles in our systematic review. Out of these nine studies, there were four systematic reviews, one traditional review, two case reports, and two observational studies. Only two articles had exclusively studied the specific association between celiac and lichen planus. The remaining studies included data that gave an overall association between other skin manifestations of celiac disease. From our study, we could not establish the relationship between celiac disease and lichen planus. We need more case-control studies and clinical trials with a larger population to get conclusive data. From current data, we can conclude that both immunological processes correlate but there is no causation.

673720,Seaweeds and Their Natural Products for Preventing Cardiovascular Associated Dysfunction,2021-09-07,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The emergence of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 marked the synchronization of the world to a peculiar clock that is counting infected cases and deaths instead of hours and minutes. The pandemic, highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has indeed caused considerable morbidity and mortality and drastically changed our everyday lives. As we continue to become acquainted with the seventh coronavirus known to infect our species, a number of its characteristics keep surprising us. Among those is the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations of the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which ranges from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. MAIN BODY: Data, now from patient populations, are beginning to accumulate on human genetic factors that may contribute to the observed diversified disease severity. Therefore, we deemed it prudent to review the associations between specific human genetic variants and clinical disease severity or susceptibility to infection that have been reported in the literature to date (at the time of writing this article in early August 2020 with updates in mid-September). With this work, we hope (i) to assist the fast-paced biomedical research efforts to combat the virus by critically summarizing current knowledge on the potential role of host genetics, and (ii) to help guide current genetics and genomics research towards candidate gene variants that warrant further investigation in larger studies. We found that determinants of differing severity of COVID-19 predominantly include components of the immune response to the virus, while determinants of differing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 mostly entail genes related to the initial stages of infection (i.e., binding of the cell surface receptor and entry). CONCLUSION: Elucidating the genetic determinants of COVID-19 severity and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection would allow for the stratification of individuals according to risk so that those at high risk would be prioritized for immunization, for example, if or when safe and effective vaccines are developed. Our enhanced understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms could also guide personalized therapeutics. Such knowledge is already beginning to provide clues that help explain, at least in part, current epidemiologic observations regarding the typically more severe or benign disease course in older males and children, respectively.","Anastassopoulou, Cleo; Gkizarioti, Zoi; Patrinos, George P.; Tsakris, Athanasios",Hum Genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40246-020-00290-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33092637/,15

We aimed to assess the preventive potential of regular bromhexine hydrochloride intake for COVID-19 risk reduction in medical staff actively involved in the evaluation and treatment of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In a single-center randomized open-label study medical staff managing patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and followed-up for 8 weeks. The study began at the initiation of COVID-19 management in the clinic. We enrolled 50 participants without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection: 25 were assigned to bromhexine hydrochloride treatment (8 mg 3 times per day), and 25 were controls. The composite primary endpoint was a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to SARS-CoV-2 or the signs of clinical infection within 28 days and at week 8. Secondary endpoints included the symptomatic infection rate and positive nasopharyngeal swab (PCR) tests. Results: The rate of the combined primary endpoint did not differ significantly between the active treatment group (2/25 [8%]) and control group (7/25 [28%]); P = 0.07. A fewer number of participants developed symptomatic infection (confirmed COVID-19) in the treatment group compared to controls (0/25 vs 5/25; P = 0.02). Conclusion: Bromhexine hydrochloride prophylaxis was associated with a reduced rate of symptomatic COVID-19.

The shift in the nature of products entails secular trends for the definitions of “drugs” and “target population” and for clinical use and evidence generation. We discuss that the lessons learned from evidence generation for 20th century medicines may have limited relevance for 21st century medicines. We explain why the future is not about randomized controlled trials (RCTs) vs. real‐world evidence (RWE) but RCTs and RWE—not just for the assessment of safety but also of effectiveness. Finally, we highlight that, in the era of precision medicine, we may not be able to reliably describe some small treatment effects—either by way of RCTs or RWE.","Eichler, Hans‐Georg; Pignatti, Francesco; Schwarzer‐Daum, Brigitte; Hidalgo‐Simon, Ana; Eichler, Irmgard; Arlett, Peter; Humphreys, Anthony; Vamvakas, Spiros; Brun, Nikolai; Rasi, Guido",Clin Pharmacol Ther,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.2083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33063841/,15

Individually housed calves were systematically assigned at birth to 1 of 2 feeding programs: free-access feeding (ad libitum) of acidified milk replacer (ACD, n = 249) or traditional restricted feeding (3 L fed twice daily) of milk replacer (RES, n = 249). Calves were fed milk replacer containing 24% crude protein and 18% fat. Acidified milk replacer was prepared to a target pH between 4.0 and 4.5 using formic acid. Calves were weaned off milk replacer at approximately 6 wk of age. Weaning occurred over 5 d, and during this weaning period, ACD calves had access to milk replacer for 12 h/d and RES calves were offered only one feeding of milk replacer (3 L) daily. Calves were monitored daily for signs of disease. Fecal consistency scores were assigned each week from birth until weaning. A subset of calves was systematically selected for fecal sampling at 3 time points between 7 and 27 d of age. Fecal samples were analyzed for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F5, Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus, and coronavirus. Hip width, hip height, body length, heart girth, and body weight were measured at birth and weaning. Postweaning body weight measurements were collected from the heifers at approximately 8 mo of age. Postweaning body weight and carcass grading information was collected from the veal calves at slaughter once a live weight between 300 and 350 kg had been achieved. The odds of ACD calves being treated for a preweaning disease event tended to be lower than that of the RES calves (1.2 vs. 5.2%, respectively). Preweaning mortality, postweaning disease treatment, and postweaning mortality did not differ between feeding treatments. The ACD feeding treatment supported greater preweaning average daily gain (0.59 vs. 0.43 kg/d) and structural growth than RES feeding. Postweaning average daily gain and carcass characteristics were similar for ACD and RES calves. These results indicate that free-access acidified milk replacer feeding tended to support improved health, and greater body weight gain and structural growth during the preweaning period; these effects did not persist in the postweaning period. The growth advantage observed before weaning in the ACD calves likely disappeared due to the weaning methods used.","Todd, C.G.; Leslie, K.E.; Millman, S.T.; Bielmann, V.; Anderson, N.G.; Sargeant, J.M.; DeVries, T.J.",J Dairy Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030216307445; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030216307445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27816246/; https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-11401,15

Italy installed a successful nationwide lockdown to mitigate the exponential increase of case numbers, as the basic reproduction number R0 reached 1 within 4 weeks. But is R0 really the relevant criterion as to whether or not community spreading is under control? In most parts of the world, testing largely focused on symptomatic cases, and we thus hypothesized that the true number of infected cases and relative testing capacity are better determinants to guide lockdown exit strategies. We employed the SEIR model to estimate the numbers of undocumented cases. As expected, the estimated numbers of all cases largely exceeded the reported ones in all Italian regions. Next, we used the numbers of reported and estimated cases per million of population and compared it with the respective numbers of tests. In Lombardy, as the most affected region, testing capacity per reported new case seemed between two and eight most of the time, but testing capacity per estimated new cases never reached four up to April 30. In contrast, Veneto‘s testing capacity per reported and estimated new cases were much less discrepant and were between four and 16 most of the time. As per April 30 also Marche, Lazio and other Italian regions arrived close to 16 ratio of test capacity per new estimated infection. Thus, the criterion to exit a lockdown should be decided at the level of the regions, based on the local testing capacity that should reach 16 times the estimated true number of newly infected cases as predicted.","Li, Chenyu; Romagnani, Paola; Anders, Hans-Joachim",Front Big Data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33693399/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fdata.2020.00026,15

Originally identified as a respiratory disease, similar to previously discovered SARS and MERS type viruses, concern has since been raised about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the vasculature. This viral-vascular involvement is of particular concern with regards to the small vessels present in the brain, with mounting evidence demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of crossing the blood-brain-barrier. Severe symptoms of infection, termed COVID-19, often result in neurological complications, regardless of patient age. These neurological complications range from mild to severe across all demographics, however, the long-term repercussions of neurological involvement on patient health are still unknown.","Whitmore, Hannah A.B.; Kim, Leo A.",Am J Pathol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944021002601; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2021.04.017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944021002601?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34126084/,15

This study aimed to determine the relationship between changes in temperature, humidity, rainfall, and SARS-CoV-2 contagion. Five ecologically and climatically distinct regions were considered—Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, and Gilgit-Baltistan. METHOD: Data on daily COVID-19 cases and deaths were retrieved from government officials, while meteorological information was collected from Pakistan Meteorological Department.. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20 and the Spearman rank correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between the meteorological factors and COVID-19 cases and deaths. RESULT: Positive correlation of COVID-19 incidence was observed with all the temperature ranges (maximum, minimum and average) and negative correlation was seen with humidity, DTR and rainfall. COVID-19 deaths were positively associated with temperature and were negatively associated only with humidity. Linear regression showed that for every unit increase in humidity, there was a −3.345 daily significant decrease in COVID-19 cases, while in Karachi for every unit increase in humidity, there remained a 10.104 daily significant increase in cases. In Gilgit-Baltistan, for every unit increase in average temperature and rainfall respectively, significant increases of 0.534 and 1.286 in daily cases were found. CONCLUSION: This study signifies the effect of climate factors on COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate, but climate factors are not the only variable and several other interlinked factors enhance the spread of COVID-19. Hence, effective mitigation policies, enhancing testing capacities, and developing public attitudes toward adopting precautionary measures are important to overcome this overwhelming pandemic.","Basray, Rabia; Malik, Amber; Waqar, Wajiha; Chaudhry, Ambreen; Wasif Malik, Muhammad; Ali Khan, Mumtaz; Ansari, Jamil A.; Ikram, Aamir",J Biosaf Biosecur,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2588933821000030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786420/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2588933821000030?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobb.2021.02.001,15

These cases can need the intervention of forensic pathologists in order to identify causes of death and to clarify malpractice claims. For these reasons, it would be useful to identify immunohistochemistry patterns of SARS-CoV-2 deaths. Thus, the authors described immunohistochemistry findings of two Patients: perivascular recruitment of T-cells in lung parenchyma, massive activation of cytotoxic cells (especially in spleen’s parenchyma), and diffuse platelet aggregation in medium/small vessels. In addition, they analyzed these data in the light of the scientific literature, pointing out meaningful immunohistochemistry patterns in order to better understand SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology process and to clearly identify causes/contributing factors of death in forensic routine.","Lupariello, Francesco; Godio, Laura; Di Vella, Giancarlo",Leg Med (Tokyo),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33894671/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.legalmed.2021.101894; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1344622321000584; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1344622321000584?v=s5,15

Faced with this threat and no effective treatment, in line with many other countries, the UK adopted enforced social distancing (lockdown) to reduce transmission—successfully reducing the reproductive number R below one. However, given the large pool of susceptible individuals that remain, complete relaxation of controls is likely to generate a substantial further outbreak. Vaccination remains the only foreseeable means of both containing the infection and returning to normal interactions and behaviour. Here, we consider the optimal targeting of vaccination within the UK, with the aim of minimising future deaths or quality adjusted life year (QALY) losses. We show that, for a range of assumptions on the action and efficacy of the vaccine, targeting older age groups first is optimal and may be sufficient to stem the epidemic if the vaccine prevents transmission as well as disease.","Moore, Sam; Hill, Edward M.; Dyson, Louise; Tildesley, Michael J.; Keeling, Matt J.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33956791/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008849,15

METHODS: We conducted a comparative cohort study of patients with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 (confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 PCR), compared in a 1:2 ratio with matched comparators on age, sex and date of COVID-19 diagnosis, between 1 March and 8 April 2020, at Partners HealthCare System in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area. We examined differences in demographics, clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 infection. The main outcomes were hospitalisation, intensive care admission, mechanical ventilation and mortality. RESULTS: We identified 52 rheumatic disease patients with COVID-19 (mean age, 63 years; 69% female) and matched these to 104 non-rheumatic disease comparators. The majority (39, 75%) of patients with rheumatic disease were on immunosuppressive medications. Patients with and without rheumatic disease had similar symptoms and laboratory findings. A similar proportion of patients with and without rheumatic disease were hospitalised (23 (44%) vs 42 (40%)), p=0.50) but those with rheumatic disease required intensive care admission and mechanical ventilation more often (11 (48%) vs 7 (18%), multivariable OR 3.11 (95% CI 1.07 to 9.05)). Mortality was similar between the two groups (3 (6%) vs 4 (4%), p=0.69). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 infection were more likely to require mechanical ventilation but had similar clinical features and hospitalisation rates as those without rheumatic disease. These findings have important implications for patients with rheumatic disease but require further validation.","D’Silva, Kristin M; Serling-Boyd, Naomi; Wallwork, Rachel; Hsu, Tiffany; Fu, Xiaoqing; Gravallese, Ellen M; Choi, Hyon K; Sparks, Jeffrey A; Wallace, Zachary S",Ann Rheum Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32457048/; https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-217888,15

Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have been deemed particularly vulnerable given their high rates of disability and increased susceptibility to infections. There have also been concerns regarding disease-modifying therapy (DMT) during the pandemic as many DMTs may increase the risk of infection due to some of their immunosuppressive properties. Furthermore, due to MS-related chronic inflammatory damage within the central nervous system, there have been concerns for worsening neurological injury by COVID-19. This has resulted in an alarmingly high level of anxiety and stress among the MS community leading to a lack of compliance with medications and routine check-ups, and even failure to obtain treatment for relapse. However, there is currently substantial evidence that MS and most DMT usage is not associated with increased COVID-19 severity. MS patients who suffer worse outcomes were more likely to be older and suffer from significant disabilities and comorbid conditions, which would also be expected from those in the general population. Likewise, there is little if any evidence demonstrating an increased susceptibility of MS patients to COVID-19-related neurological complications. Therefore, we aim to summarize the most recent findings related to COVID-19 and MS demonstrating that MS and most DMTs do not appear as risk factors for severe COVID-19.","Chaudhry, Farhan; Jageka, Cristina; Levy, Phillip D.; Cerghet, Mirela; Lisak, Robert P",J Cell Immunol,https://doi.org/10.33696/immunology.3.080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33959727/,15

Our results using human coronaviruses, hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43, have indicated that 277-nm UVC LED is most effective in viral inactivation, followed by 222-nm far UVC and 254-nm UVC mercury lamp. While UVC mercury lamp is more effective in degrading viral genomic content compared to 277-nm UVC LED, the latter results in a pronounced photo-degradation of spike proteins which potentially contributed to the higher efficacy of coronavirus inactivation. Hence, inactivation of coronaviruses by 277-nm UVC LED irradiation constitutes a more promising method for disinfection.","Ong, Qunxiang; Ronnie Teo, J.

The purpose of this study was to identify the focus of Korean public service advertisements (PSAs) in response to the MERS and COVID-19 outbreaks, along with the differences between them. METHODS: A total of five MERS and 17 COVID-19 TV PSAs were analyzed using Lasswell’s Sender, Message, Channel, Receiver, and Effect model and the responses of the Korean government were compared between the MERS and COVID-19 outbreaks. RESULTS: During the MERS outbreak, the Korean government failed to gain the public’s trust through its PSAs. Despite its best efforts, it provided opaque and selective information on the crisis. Conversely, in the case of COVID-19, the Korean government has successfully worked to strengthen community awareness by supporting and encouraging the public. CONCLUSION: Despite the Korean government’s improved communication in the COVID-19 crisis, there has been an insufficient response to the needs of vulnerable groups that could be placed in at-risk situations as a result of domestic violence or mental health problems during outbreaks of novel infectious diseases that require aggressive management.","Park, Dahye; Ha, Jeongmin",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33177902/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s269230,15

This study investigated depression, anxiety and stress in New Zealand (NZ) during the first 10 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated psychological and behavioural factors. It also compares the results with a similar cross-sectional study in the UK. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: NZ community cohort. PARTICIPANTS: N=681 adults (≥18 years) in NZ. The cohort was predominantly female (89%) with a mean age of 42 years (range 18–87). Most (74%) identified as NZ European and almost half (46%) were keyworkers. Most were non-smokers (95%) and 20% identified themselves as having clinical risk factors which would put them at increased or greatest risk of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, anxiety, stress, positive mood and engagement in health behaviours (smoking, exercise, alcohol consumption). RESULTS: Depression and anxiety significantly exceeded population norms (p<0.0001). Being younger (p<0.0001) and most at risk of COVID-19 (p<0.05) were associated with greater depression, anxiety and stress. Greater positive mood, lower loneliness and greater exercise were protective factors for all outcomes (p<0.0001). Smoking (p=0.037) and alcohol consumption (p<0.05) were associated with increased anxiety. Pet ownership was associated with lower depression (p=0.006) and anxiety (p=0.008). When adjusting for age and gender differences, anxiety (p=0.002) and stress (p=0.007) were significantly lower in NZ than in the UK. The NZ sample reported lower perceived risk (p<0.0001) and worry about COVID-19 (p<0.0001) than the UK sample. CONCLUSIONS: The NZ population had higher depression and anxiety compared with population norms. Younger people and those most at risk of COVID-19 reported poorer mental health.

Sufficient testing for SARS-CoV-2 remains essential for tracking and containing the rapid spread of the virus. However, due to increased global demand, kits and proprietary reagents for RNA extraction are limited, which markedly reduce SARS-CoV-2 testing capabilities in many countries. Here, we explore the use of conventional acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (AGPC)-based RNA purification as an alternative to commercial automated systems for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. 87 clinical oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens were extracted by AGPC and compared to the commercial platforms, the Maxwell(R) RSC 48 instrument for automated RNA extraction and the fully integrated diagnostic system, the Cobas(R)6800 apparatus. Our results show that RNA extracted using the AGPC method is fully comparable to modern automated systems regarding analytical sensitivity, specificity and accuracy with respect to detection of SARS-CoV-2 as evaluated by RT-qPCR. Moreover, we find that the AGPC method is easily scalable and implemented in conventional laboratories.

The uncertainties during that period had a significant impact on the provision of dental care. However the city's only dental hospital continued to function and to support the Faculty of Dentistry of the University of Hong Kong in educating dental students and other members of the dental team. At the time of writing no transmissions of the disease have been attributed to procedures associated with dental healthcare. This article chronicles the sequence of events during the outbreak from a dental perspective. It highlights information that may be useful to dental colleagues who might someday be confronted with similar outbreaks of newly emerged potentially lethal infections.","Smales, F C; Samaranyake, L P",Br Dent J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14631425/,15

It is known that cytokine release is associated with disease severity, but the relationship between the different clinical phenotypes and inflammatory endotypes is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the association between inflammatory biomarker-based endotypes and severe COVID-19 phenotypes. METHODS: Interleukin (IL) -6, C-reactive protein (CRP), C–X–C motif chemokine (CXCL) 9, IL-18, C–C motif chemokine (CCL) 3, CCL17, IL-10, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured in 57 COVID-19 patients, and their association with clinical characteristics was examined using a cluster analysis. RESULTS: Significantly higher blood levels of the eight inflammatory markers were noted in patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) than in those who did not develop ARDS (non-ARDS). Using a cluster analysis, the patient groups were classified into four clusters, of which two had patients with high IL-6 and CRP levels. In the cluster with high levels of Type 1 (T1) inflammatory markers such as CXCL9 and IL-18, 85% of the patients had ARDS, 65% of the patients developed acute kidney injury (AKI), and 78% of the patients developed pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: In the cluster with high levels of T1 inflammatory markers, the patients frequently suffered from tissue damage, manifested as ARDS and AKI. Our findings identified distinct T1 inflammatory endotypes of COVID-19 and suggest the importance of controlling inflammation by monitoring T1 biomarkers and treating accordingly to limit the severity of the disease.","Hasegawa, Takehiro; Nakagawa, Atsushi; Suzuki, Kohjin; Yamashita, Kazuto; Yamashita, Saya; Iwanaga, Niina; Tamada, Eiya; Noda, Kenta; Tomii, Keisuke",Cytokine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466621002040?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2021.155618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127355/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466621002040,15

681996,Screening for Viral Infections,2020-12-09,"Respiratory virus challenge studies involve administration of the challenge virus and sampling to assess for protection in the same anatomical locations. It can therefore be difficult to differentiate actively replicating virus from input challenge virus. For SARS-CoV-2, specific monitoring of actively replicating virus is critical for investigating the protective and therapeutic efficacy of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antiviral drugs. We adapted a SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) RT-PCR assay to differentiate productive infection from inactivated or neutralized virus. Subgenomic RNAs are generated after cell entry and are poorly incorporated into mature virions, and thus may provide a marker for actively replicating virus. We show envelope (E) sgRNA was degraded by RNase in infected cell lysates, while genomic RNA (gRNA) was protected, presumably due to packaging into virions. To investigate the capacity of the sgRNA assay to distinguish input challenge virus from actively replicating virus in vivo, we compared the E sgRNA assay to a standard nucleoprotein (N) or E total (both gRNA and sgRNA) RNA in convalescent rhesus macaques and in antibody-treated rhesus macaques after experimental SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In both studies, the E sgRNA assay was negative, suggesting protective efficacy, whereas the N and E total RNA assays remained positive. These data suggest the potential utility of sgRNA to monitor actively replicating virus in prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 studies. IMPORTANCE Developing therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a public health priority. During challenge studies, respiratory viruses are delivered and sampled from the same anatomical location. It is therefore important to distinguish actively replicating virus from input challenge virus. The most common assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) targeting nucleocapsid total RNA, cannot distinguish neutralized input virus from replicating virus. In this study, we assess SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA as a potential measure of replicating virus in rhesus macaques.","Dagotto, Gabriel; Mercado, Noe B.; Martinez, David R.; Hou, Yixuan J.; Nkolola, Joseph P.; Carnahan, Robert H.; Crowe, James E.; Baric, Ralph S.; Barouch, Dan H.",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472939/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02370-20,15
682114,Synthesis and anti‐coronavirus activity of a series of 1‐thia‐4‐azaspiro[4.5]decan‐3‐one derivatives,2019-05-09,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, the average time between a first concern of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and diagnosis is over 2 years. After referral for assessment, families often wait 6-12 months before their appointment. This can be a time of uncertainty and stress for families. For some families, other forms of assistance are not accessible and thus timely intervention opportunities are missed. There is little evidence about how to provide the best support for children or caregivers while on assessment waiting lists. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine whether use of a coaching intervention called Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC) combined with service navigation support is feasible for families waiting for ASD assessment, as a crucial first step in planning a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: A pilot and feasibility study will be conducted using recommended constructs and associated measures, which will be reported using CONSORT (Consolidated Standards or Reporting Trials) guidance. Participants will be child and caregiver dyads or triads, recruited within 4 months of their child (aged 1-7 years) being referred to one of two services for an ASD assessment in Victoria, Australia. A blinded randomization procedure will be used to allocate participants to one of three trial arms: (1) coaching and support intervention delivered face to face, (2) coaching and support intervention via videoconference, and (3) usual care. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the sample characteristics of parents and children, inclusive of service access at baseline and follow up. Recruitment rates will be reported, and retention rates will be evaluated against a predicted rate of 70%-80% in each intervention arm. Goal attainment, using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, will indicate preliminary evidence for efficacy within the intervention arms, with an increase of 2 or more points on a 10-point performance and satisfaction scale considered clinically significant. RESULTS: The study was approved by The Royal Children’s Hospital Research Ethics and Governance Department in September 2018. As of October 2020, 16 families have been recruited to the study. Data analysis is ongoing and results are expected to be published in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings will support planning for a future randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of OPC and service navigation support for caregivers of children awaiting ASD assessment.

682159,Properties of Two Enterovirus Antibodies that are Utilized in Diabetes Research,2016-04-19,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing an unprecedented global pandemic demanding the urgent development of therapeutic strategies. Microarray binding experiments using an extensive heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide library showed that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can bind HS in a length-and sequence-dependent manner. Hexa- and octa-saccharides composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units were identified as optimal ligands. Surface plasma resonance (SPR) showed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with much higher affinity to heparin (KD = 55 nM) compared to the RBD (KD = 1 μM) alone. We also found that heparin does not interfere in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding or proteolytic processing of the spike. Our data supports a model in which HS functions as the point of initial attachment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Tissue staining studies using biologically relevant tissues indicate that heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) is a critical attachment factor for the virus. Collectively, our results highlight the potential of using HS oligosaccharides as a therapeutic agent by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells.","Liu, Lin; Chopra, Pradeep; Li, Xiuru; Bouwman, Kim M.; Tompkins, S.

682276,Graphene-Based Strategies in Liquid Biopsy and in Viral Diseases Diagnosis,2020-05-26,"BACKGROUND: : Distinctive genotypes of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged that are or may be associated with increased transmission, pathogenicity, and/or antibody escape. In many countries, clinical and diagnostic laboratories are under mandate to identify and report these so-called variants of concern (VOC). OBJECTIVES: : We used an external quality assessment scheme to determine the scope, accuracy, and reliability of laboratories using various molecular diagnostic assays to identify current VOC (03 March 2021). STUDY DESIGN: : Participant laboratories were sent the same five patient-derived samples and were asked to provide their variant detection methods, variant detection results and interpretation of results. RESULTS: : Twenty-five laboratories reported a range of RT-qPCR-based assays to identify specific variations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are characteristic of three VOC lineages. Laboratories that detected VOC-associated nucleotide mutations at four specific sites had the highest ratio of correct classification. Low template copy number and additional variation in target regions resulted in loss of confidence and accuracy in sample classification. CONCLUSIONS: : Melting-curve-based assays to identify genomic variants are less time-consuming and require less bioinformatic analysis compared to partial or whole genome sequencing. However, our results suggest that correct classification of a given genotype/lineage (e.g., a VOC) relies on the ability to detect more than one variant site, adequate template in the sample (i.e., relatively high viral load/copy number) and results may be unclear in certain samples with additional genetic variations. These initial results suggest that some diagnostic laboratories may require additional training to interpret and report complex genetic information about a dynamic emerging virus.","Camp, Jeremy V.; Buchta, Christoph; Jovanovic, Jovana; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth; Benka, Bernhard; Griesmacher, Andrea; Aberle, Stephan W.; Görzer, Irene",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653221001724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34273859/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104905; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653221001724?v=s5,15
683332,"Coronaviridae: 100,000 Years of Emergence and Reemergence",2019-09-20,"An alarming increase in emergence of antibiotic resistance among pathogens worldwide has become a serious threat to our ability to treat infectious diseases according to the World Health Organization. Extensive use of antibiotics by livestock producers promotes the spread of new resistant strains, some of zoonotic concern, which increases food-borne illness in humans and causes significant economic burden on healthcare systems. Furthermore, consumer preferences for meat/poultry/fish produced without the use of antibiotics shape today’s market demand. So, it is viewed as inevitable by the One Health Initiative that humans need to reduce the use of antibiotics and turn to alternative, improved means to control disease: vaccination and prophylactics. Besides the intense research focused on novel therapeutic molecules, both these strategies rely heavily on the availability of cost-effective, efficient and scalable production platforms which will allow large-volume manufacturing for vaccines, antibodies and other biopharmaceuticals. Within this context, plant-based platforms for production of recombinant therapeutic proteins offer significant advantages over conventional expression systems, including lack of animal pathogens, low production costs, fast turnaround and response times and rapid, nearly-unlimited scalability. Also, because dried leaves and seeds can be stored at room temperature for lengthy periods without loss of recombinant proteins, plant expression systems have the potential to offer lucrative benefits from the development of edible vaccines and prophylactics, as these would not require “cold chain” storage and transportation, and could be administered in mass volumes with minimal processing. Several biotechnology companies currently have developed and adopted plant-based platforms for commercial production of recombinant protein therapeutics. In this manuscript, we outline the challenges in the process of livestock immunization as well as the current plant biotechnology developments aimed to address these challenges.","Kolotilin, Igor; Topp, Ed; Cox, Eric; Devriendt, Bert; Conrad, Udo; Joensuu, Jussi; Stöger, Eva; Warzecha, Heribert; McAllister, Tim; Potter, Andrew; McLean, Michael D; Hall, J Christopher; Menassa, Rima",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25559098/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-014-0117-4,15

However, the results were not consistent on the association between air pollution and the spread of COVID-19. In the study, air pollution data and the confirmed cases of COVID-19 were both gathered from five severe cities across three countries in South America. Daily real-time population regeneration (R(t)) was calculated to assess the spread of COVID-19. Two frequently used models, generalized additive models (GAM) and multiple linear regression, were both used to explore the impact of environmental pollutants on the epidemic. Wide ranges of all six air pollutants were detected across the five cities. Spearman’s correlation analysis confirmed the positive correlation within six pollutants. Rt value showed a gradual decline in all the five cities. Further analysis showed that the association between air pollution and COVID-19 varied across five cities. According to our research results, even for the same region, varied models gave inconsistent results. For example, in Sao Paulo, both models show SO(2) and O(3) are significant independent variables, however, the GAM model shows that PM(10) has a nonlinear negative correlation with R(t), while PM(10) has no significant correlation in the multiple linear model. Moreover, in the case of multiple regions, currently used models should be selected according to local conditions. Our results indicate that there is a significant relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 infection, which will help states, health practitioners, and policy makers in combating the COVID-19 pandemic in South America.

The optimal management of patients infected with COVID-19 is still unclear, although the consensus is moving toward the need of a biphasic approach. During the first phase of the disease (from onset of the symptoms up to 7–10 days) viral-induced effects are prominent, with the opportunity to institute antiviral therapy. In the second inflammatory phase of the disease, immunosuppressive strategies (for example with glucocorticoids or anticytokine drugs) may be considered. This latter stage is characterized by the development of progressive lung involvement with increasing oxygen requirements and occasionally signs of the hemophagocytic syndrome. The management of the disease in patients with kidney disease is even more challenging, especially in those who are immunosuppressed or with severe comorbidities. Here we present the therapeutic approach used in Brescia (Italy) for managing patients infected with COVID-19 who underwent kidney transplantation and are receiving hemodialysis.

Their genomes carry single nucleotide polymorphisms and deletions that are characteristic of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern, but lack the full complement of lineage-defining mutations. Instead, the remainder of their genomes share contiguous genetic variation with non-B.1.1.7 viruses circulating in the same geographic area at the same time as the recombinants. In four instances there was evidence for onward transmission of a recombinant-origin virus, including one transmission cluster of 45 sequenced cases over the course of two months. The inferred genomic locations of recombination breakpoints suggest that every community-transmitted recombinant virus inherited its spike region from a B.1.1.7 parental virus, consistent with a transmission advantage for B.1.1.7's set of mutations.","Jackson, B.; Boni, M.

At present, ACKR3 is considered a target for cancer and cardiovascular disorders, but less is known about the potential of ACKR3 as a target for brain disease. Further, mouse lines have been created to identify cells expressing the receptor, but there is no tool to visualize and study the receptor itself under physiological conditions. Here, we engineered a knock-in (KI) mouse expressing a functional ACKR3-Venus fusion protein to directly detect the receptor, particularly in the adult brain. In HEK-293 cells, native and fused receptors showed similar membrane expression, ligand induced trafficking and signaling profiles, indicating that the Venus fusion does not alter receptor signaling. We also found that ACKR3-Venus enables direct real-time monitoring of receptor trafficking using resonance energy transfer. In ACKR3-Venus knock-in mice, we found normal ACKR3 mRNA levels in the brain, suggesting intact gene transcription. We fully mapped receptor expression across 14 peripheral organs and 112 brain areas and found that ACKR3 is primarily localized to the vasculature in these tissues. In the periphery, receptor distribution aligns with previous reports. In the brain there is notable ACKR3 expression in endothelial vascular cells, hippocampal GABAergic interneurons and neuroblast neighboring cells.

Problem-solving skills were needed to continue the level of WOC nursing services expected by patients, families, and professional colleagues, while reducing the hours we were physically present at our clinical facility. In order to respond to these demands, our team realized it must create an innovative approach to provide efficient, cost-effective consultations during this global crisis. This Challenges in Practice article summarizes our experience with use of telemedicine technologies to perform remote consultations within the acute care setting. CASES: Case 1 was a 52-year-old woman with a history of paraplegia. She had several pressure injuries but had not received topical care for these wounds prior to admission. A consultation for the WOC nurse was requested and performed via telehealth services on a day our team was working off-site. This case illustrates the process our team used to perform a virtual consultation and demonstrates how the use of images placed in the electronic medical record aided in developing an effective plan of care. Case 2 was a 48-year-old man who tested positive for COVID-19. He developed bilateral unstageable pressure injuries on his cheeks after being placed in the prone position for a prolonged period while critically ill. This case describes multiple technologic platforms used for telemedicine consults in a patient with COVID-19 requiring isolation. CONCLUSIONS: Remote consultation by WOC nurses was possible in our healthcare system because of previous experience using telemedicine technology and well-established collaborative relationships with providers and bedside nurses.

This situation can generate sudden illness and work accidents where the need to have knowledge in emergency first response (EFR) is necessary for all. Unfortunately, workshops and courses to certify EFR individuals are usually taught only to healthcare professionals. Therefore, to address this need a EFR project has been developed at the Tecnológico de Monterrey (TEC) which consists of a multidisciplinary challenge to train, certify, and evaluate students’ competency as “emergency first responders” in medical emergencies and healthcare awareness. This EFR project has been performed for one week, every year since 2015, and constitutes a joint venture among academic departments, faculty, and industrial/government institutions, which work together in multidisciplinary projects, providing a source of innovative proposals.

The purpose of present study is to develop and apply a computational tool for predicting evolution of different epidemiological variables for COVID-19 in India. We propose a dynamic SIRD (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead) and SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead) model for this purpose. In the dynamic model, time dependent infection rate is assumed for estimating evolution of different variables of the model. Parameter estimation of the model is the first step of the analysis which is performed by least square optimization of priori data. In the second step of the analysis, simulation is carried out by using evaluated parameters for prediction of the outbreak. The computational model has been validated against real data for COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Time to reach peak, peak infected cases and total reported cases were compared with actual data and found to be in very good agreement. Next the model is applied for the case of India and various Indian states to predict different epidemiological parameters.

Methods: This prospective cohort study of the correlates of the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was conducted at the Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care units of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy. The clinical characteristics of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the early days of the epidemic (21 February -19 March 2020) were recorded upon admission, and the time-dependent probability of death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method (censored as of 20 April 2020). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the factors independently associated with the risk of death. Results: Forty-eight (20.6%) of the 233 patients followed up for a median of 40 days (interquartile range 33-47) died during the follow-up. Most were males (69.1%) and their median age was 61 years (IQR 50-72). The time-dependent probability of death was 19.7% (95% CI 14.6-24.9%) 30 days after hospital admission. Age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.08, 95% CI 1.48-2.92 per ten years more) and obesity (aHR 3.04, 95% CI 1.42-6.49) were independently associated with an increased risk of death, which was also associated with critical disease (aHR 8.26, 95% CI 1.41-48.29), C-reactive protein levels (aHR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02-1.35 per 50 mg/L more) and creatinine kinase levels above 185 U/L (aHR 2.58, 95% CI 1.37-4.87) upon admission. Conclusions: Case-fatality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the early days of the Italian epidemic was about 20%. Our study adds evidence to the notion that older age, obesity and more advanced illness are factors associated to an increased risk of death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Giacomelli, A.; Ridolfo, A.

He had visited a hospital for fever and cough and been treated with antibiotics for pneumonia in the right upper lobe. However, he gradually progressed to dyspnea and consulted our hospital. His chest radiographs showed bilateral pneumonia shadows and his CT showed ground glass opacities and consolidation. Although we treated him with broad-spectrum antibiotics, the pneumonia shadow rapidly progressed and mechanical ventilation was administered. We collected sputum from the bronchus using bronchoscopy to detect microorganisms, and RT-PCR tests confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. He was transferred to a designated hospital. In order to prevent the occurrence of nosocomial infections, close contacts within the hospital and medical staff were suspended from their work for two weeks. No secondary infection with COVID-19 appeared. This was the first case of COVID-19 occurring as community-acquired pneumonia in Hokkaido, Japan.","Yokoo, Keiki; Sugaya, Fumiko; Matsuzaka, Suguru; Ueda, Kentaro; Kamimura, Ryosuke; Yokoyama, Takeshi; Ambo, Yoshiyasu; Yamada, Gen; Narita, Yoshiaki",Respir Med Case Rep,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221300712030188X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32391243/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221300712030188X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmcr.2020.101078,15

In the case of the Coronaviridae this family is now recognized as including potent human pathogens causing upper and lower respiratory tract infections as well as nosocomial ones. Within the purpose of developing new antiseptics molecules, the antiseptic virucidal activity of two calix[4]arene derivatives, the tetra-para-sulfonato-calix[4]arene (C[4]S) and the 1,3-bis(bithiazolyl)-tetra-para-sulfonato-calix[4]arene (C[4]S-BTZ) were evaluated toward the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E). Comparing these results with some obtained previously with chlorhexidine and hexamidine, (i) these two calixarenes did not show any cytotoxicity contrary to chlorhexidine and hexamidine, (ii) C[4]S showed as did hexamidine, a very weak activity against HCoV 229E, and (iii) the C[4]S-BTZ showed a stronger activity than chlorhexidine, i.e. 2.7 and 1.4 log(10) reduction in viral titer after 5 min of contact with 10(−3) mol L(−1) solutions of C[4]S-BTZ and chlorhexidine, respectively.

With the ongoing and possible evolving use of face coverings as a public health protection measure against the transmission of COVID‐19, this is likely to be an ongoing challenge for those who find their use challenging. The wearing of face coverings following trauma is likely to be of ongoing relevance, making this an area that would benefit from further research. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE? The authors present their personal and professional experiences as a means of highlighting the difficulties that can be faced as a result of the use of face coverings. The window of tolerance helps to understand the difficulties that can be caused by wearing face coverings and provides a visual means of conceptualizing the cognitive, behavioural, physiological and emotional reactions that can occur as a result of their use. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE? This paper provides an awareness of the link between trauma and the wearing of face coverings, and how their use could be re‐traumatizing for those accessing services. This topic is relevant across all sectors where it is only just beginning to be acknowledged that for many, particularly those with experiences of interpersonal trauma, difficulties can arise due to the use of face coverings. The sharing of grounding techniques and an introduction to the window of tolerance provides a means of collaboratively developing skills and developing a shared understanding of the difficulties associated with the use of face coverings.","Welfare‐Wilson, Alison; Adley, Lenna; Bell, Zoe; Luby, Rachel",J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33587790/,15

Peer-reviewed studies estimate ICT's current share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 1.8%–2.8% of global GHG emissions; adjusting for truncation of supply chain pathways, we find that this share could actually be between 2.1% and 3.9%. For ICT's future emissions, we explore assumptions underlying analysts' projections to understand the reasons for their variability. All analysts agree that ICT emissions will not reduce without major concerted efforts involving broad political and industrial action. We provide three reasons to believe ICT emissions are going to increase barring intervention and find that not all carbon pledges in the ICT sector are ambitious enough to meet climate targets. We explore the underdevelopment of policy mechanisms for enforcing sector-wide compliance, and contend that, without a global carbon constraint, a new regulatory framework is required to keep the ICT sector's footprint aligned with the Paris Agreement.","Freitag, Charlotte; Berners-Lee, Mike; Widdicks, Kelly; Knowles, Bran; Blair, Gordon S.; Friday, Adrian",Patterns (N Y),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34553177/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100340,15
689681,Human Viruses: Emergence and Evolution,2019-09-20,"Which is the origin of genes is a fundamental question in Biology, indeed a question older than the discovery of genes itself. For more than a century, it was uneven to think in origins other than duplication and divergence from a previous gene. In recent years, however, the intersection of genetics, embryonic development, and bioinformatics, has brought to light that de novo generation from non-genic DNA, horizontal gene transfer and, noticeably, virus and transposon invasions, have shaped current genomes, by integrating those newcomers into old gene networks, helping to shape morphological and physiological innovations. We here summarized some of the recent research in the field, mostly in the vertebrate lineage with a focus on protein-coding novelties, showing that the placenta, the adaptative immune system, or the highly developed neocortex, among other innovations, are linked to de novo gene creation or domestication of virus and transposons. We provocatively suggest that the high tolerance to virus infections by bats may also be related to previous virus and transposon invasions in the bat lineage.","Herrera-Úbeda, Carlos; Garcia-Fernàndez, Jordi",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34295903/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.713918,15

Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations in 82 patients with COVID-19, including 31 patients with a critical course of the disease. In COVID-19 patients who required hospitalization we analyzed T cell subsets, including Treg cells, as well as TCRα/β and γ/δ, NK cells, and B cells, during the first two weeks after admission to hospital due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, with marked reductions in leukocytes subpopulations, especially in critically ill COVID-19 patients. We showed decreased levels of Th, Ts cells, Treg cells (both naïve and induced), TCRα/β and γ/δ cells, as well as CD16+CD56+NK cells in ICU compared to non-ICU COVID-19 patients. We observed impaired function of T and NK cells in critically ill COVID-19 patients with extremely low levels of secreted cytokines. We found that the IL-2/INFγ ratio was the strongest indicator of a critical course of COVID-19, and was associated with fatal outcomes. Our findings showed markedly impaired innate and adaptive responses in critically ill COVID-19 patients, and suggest that the immunosuppressive state in the case of a critical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection might reflect subsequent clinical deterioration and predict a fatal outcome.","Kalicińska, Elżbieta; Szymczak, Donata; Zińczuk, Aleksander; Adamik, Barbara; Smiechowicz, Jakub; Skalec, Tomasz; Nowicka-Suszko, Danuta; Biernat, Monika; Bogucka-Fedorczuk, Aleksandra; Rybka, Justyna; Martuszewski, Adrian; Gozdzik, Waldemar; Simon, Krzysztof; Wróbel, Tomasz",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071149/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10061293,15

However, the availability of validated nomograms and the machine-learning model to predict severity risk and triage of affected patients is limited. OBJECTIVE To develop and validate nomograms and machine-learning models for severity risk assessment and triage for COVID-19 patients at hospital admission. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort of 299 consecutively hospitalized COVID-19 patients at The Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from December 23, 2019, to February 13, 2020, was used to train and validate the models. Six cohorts with 426 patients from eight centers in China, Italy, and Belgium, from February 20, 2020, to March 21, 2020, were used to prospectively validate the models. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES The main outcome was the onset of severe or critical illness during hospitalization. Model performances were quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS Of the 299 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the retrospective cohort, the median age was 50 years ((interquartile range, 35.5-63.0; range, 20-94 years) and 137 (45.8%) were men. Of the 426 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the prospective cohorts, the median age was 62.0 years ((interquartile range, 50.0-72.0; range, 19-94 years) and 236 (55.4%) were men. The model was prospectively validated on six cohorts yielding AUCs ranging from 0.816 to 0.976, with accuracies ranging from 70.8% to 93.8%, sensitivities ranging from 83.7% to 100%, and specificities ranging from 41.0% to 95.7%. The cut-off values of the low, medium, and high-risk probabilities were 0.072 and 0.244. The developed online calculators can be found at www.predict19risk.ai. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE The machine learning models, nomograms, and online calculators might be useful for the prediction of onset of severe and critical illness among COVID-19 patients and triage at hospital admission. Further prospective research and clinical feedback are necessary to evaluate the clinical usefulness of this model and to determine whether these models can help optimize medical resources and reduce mortality rates compared with current clinical practices.","Wu, G.; Yang, P.; Woodruff, H.

Due to its high contagious nature, it spreads from one human to another very quickly. Now it becomes a global public health threat with no approved treatments. In silico techniques can accelerate the drug development process. Our research aimed to identify the novel drugs for inhibition of Main protease (Mpro) enzyme of COVID-19 by performing in silico approach. In this context, a library consisting of 3180 FDA-approved drugs from ‘the ZINC database’ was used to identify novel drug candidates against ‘the Mpro’ of SARS-CoV-2. Initially, the top 10 drugs out of 3180 drugs were selected by molecular docking according to their binding score. Among 10 selected drugs; seven drugs that showed binding with Mpro enzyme residue Glu166 were subjected to100 ns Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Out of seven compounds, four namely, ZINC03831201, ZINC08101052, ZINC01482077, and ZINC03830817 were found significant based on MD simulation results. Furthermore, RMSD, RMSF, RG, SASA, PCA, MMPBSA (for last 40 ns) were calculated for the 100 ns trajectory period. Currently, the world needs potent drugs in a short period and this work suggests that these four drugs could be used as novel drugs against COVID-19 and it also provides new lead compounds for further in vitro, in vivo, and ongoing clinical studies against SARS-CoV-2.

The common methods to monitor and quantitate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cell culture are so far time-consuming and labor-intensive. Using the Sleeping Beauty transposase system, we generated a robust and versatile cellular infection model that allows SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments compatible for high-throughput and live cell imaging. The model is based on lung derived A549 cells, which show a profound interferon response and convenient cell culture characteristics. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were introduced for constitutive expression (A549-AT). Subclones with varying levels of ACE2/TMPRSS2 were screened for optimal SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Furthermore, extensive evaluation demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infected A549-AT cells were distinguishable from mock-infected cells and already showed approximately 12 h post infection a clear signal to noise ratio in terms of cell roughness, fluorescence and a profound visible cytopathic effect. Moreover, due to the high transfection efficiency and proliferation capacity, Sleeping Beauty transposase-based overexpression cell lines with a second inducible fluorescence reporter cassette (eGFP) can be generated in a very short time, enabling the investigation of host and restriction factors in a doxycycline-inducible manner. Thus, the novel model cell line allows rapid and sensitive monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the screening for host factors essential for viral replication.","Widera, Marek; Wilhelm, Alexander; Toptan, Tuna; Raffel, Johanna M.; Kowarz, Eric; Roesmann, Fabian; Grözinger, Finn; Siemund, Anna Lena; Luciano, Vanessa; Külp, Marius; Reis, Jennifer; Bracharz, Silvia; Pallas, Christiane; Ciesek, Sandra; Marschalek, Rolf",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394046/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.701198,15

690418,High-Resolution Imaging of Human Viruses in Liquid Droplets,2021,"The two axes of the renin–angiotensin system include the classical ACE/Ang II/AT1 axis and the counter-regulatory ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas1 axis. ACE2 is a multifunctional monocarboxypeptidase responsible for generating Ang-(1-7) from Ang II. ACE2 is important in the vascular system where it is found in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in many vascular beds. Among the best characterized functions of ACE2 is its role in regulating vascular tone. ACE2 through its effector peptide Ang-(1-7) and receptor Mas1 induces vasodilation and attenuates Ang II-induced vasoconstriction. In endothelial cells activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas1 axis increases production of the vasodilator’s nitric oxide and prostacyclin’s and in vascular smooth muscle cells it inhibits pro-contractile and pro-inflammatory signaling. Endothelial ACE2 is cleaved by proteases, shed into the circulation and measured as soluble ACE2. Plasma ACE2 activity is increased in cardiovascular disease and may have prognostic significance in disease severity. In addition to its enzymatic function, ACE2 is the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) and SARS-Cov-2, which cause SARS and coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) respectively. ACE-2 is thus a double-edged sword: it promotes cardiovascular health while also facilitating the devastations caused by coronaviruses. COVID-19 is associated with cardiovascular disease as a risk factor and as a complication. Mechanisms linking COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease are unclear, but vascular ACE2 may be important. This review focuses on the vascular biology and (patho)physiology of ACE2 in cardiovascular health and disease and briefly discusses the role of vascular ACE2 as a potential mediator of vascular injury in COVID-19.","Kuriakose, Jithin; Montezano, Augusto C.; Touyz, Rhian M.",Clin Sci (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20200480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33511992/,15
