Intracranial infection of Balb/c mice at postnatal day 5 induced a lethal encephalitis in all animals. Of Wistar rats infected at day 2 or 5 after birth, 30 to 70%, respectively, survived. The distribution of viral antigen was studied in frozen brain sections of animals that died after infection; astrocytes were found to be the major virus‐infected cell type throughout the central nervous system. More than 75% of the surviving rat pups developed paralysis, but viral antigen was detected in only few brain cells and not in astrocytes. The cell tropism of MHV‐JHM was examined further in virus‐infected glial cell cultures derived from brains of rats or mice. In the glial cultures derived from Wistar rats, only oligodendrocytes were infected, whereas in cultures derived from mouse or Lewis rat brain viral antigen was detected in both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Infection of astrocytes led to the formation of syncytia and degradation of the cytoskeleton. Infected rat oligodendrocytes gradually disappeared from the cultures because of cell death. These phenomena indicate that, besides an indirect autoimmune response triggered by infected astrocytes, direct virus‐induced injury to astrocytes or to oligodendrocytes can have a dominant role in the neuropathogenicity of mouse hepatitis virus. The present results underscore the importance of species and developmental stage of experimental animals in the neurotropism and pathogenicity of MHV‐JHM.","van Berlo, M.F.; Warringa, R.; Wolswijk, G.; Lopes‐Cardozo, M.",Glia,748,8
28584,28584,28584,CLEF eHealth Evaluation Lab 2020,11.914441,0.47814155,2020-03-24,"In December 2013, a two-year-old child died from viral haemorrhagic fever in Méliandou village in the South-East of Guinea, and constituted the likely index case of a major epidemic. When the virus was formally identified as Ebola, epidemiologists started to investigate the chains of transmission, while local people were trying to make sense out of these deaths. The epidemic control measures taken by national and international health agencies were soon faced by strong reluctance and a sometimes aggressive attitude of the affected communities. Based on ethnographic work in Macenta (Forest region) in the autumn of 2014 for the Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network (GOARN) of the World Health Organization, this chapter shows that while epidemiologists involved in the outbreak response attributed the first Ebola deaths in the Forest region to the transmission of a virus from an unknown animal reservoir, local citizens believed these deaths were caused by the breach of a taboo. Epidemiological and popular explanations, mainly evolving in parallel, but sometimes overlapping, were driven by different explanatory models: a biomedical model embodying nature in the guise of an animal disease reservoir, which in turn poses as threat to humanity, and a traditional-religious model wherein nature and culture are not dichotomized. The chapter will argue that epidemic responses must be flexible and need to systematically document popular discourse(s), rumours, codes, practices, knowledge and opinions related to the outbreak event. This precious information must be used not only to shape and adapt control interventions and health promotion messages, but also to trace the complex biosocial dynamics of such zoonotic disease beyond the usual narrow focus on wild animals as the sources of infection.","Thys, Séverine",Framing Animals as Epidemic Villains,748,1

Bedeutet das aber, dass sie lediglich eine Ansammlung kettenartig aneinandergefügter Gene sind? Aus allen cytologischen Beobachtungen schließen wir, dass die Chromosomen, und damit die Gene, in Mitose und Meiose gleichmäßig auf die Tochterzellen verteilt werden. Dazu werden die Centromerenbereiche der Chromosomen benutzt, die als Ansatzpunkte für die Mikrotubuli des Spindelapparates dienen. So werden die Chromosomen oder deren Untereinheiten, die Chromatiden, bei der Zellteilung auf die Tochterzellen aufgeteilt. Auch bei der DNA-Replikation haben Chromosomen eine wichtige Aufgabe zu erfüllen. Der normale Replikationsmechanismus linearer DNA-Moleküle führt in jedem Replikationszyklus zu einer Verkürzung der DNADoppelhelix von den Enden her, da die RNA-Primer am Ende der DNA zwar entfernt, aber nicht durch DNASequenzen ersetzt werden können. Außerdem muss eine spezielle Struktur sicherstellen, dass die freien Enden der DNA im Chromosom nicht von Exonukleasen abgebaut werden oder durch Reparaturenzyme mit den freien Enden der DNA eines anderen Chromosoms verschmelzen. Das wird durch besondere terminale Domänen, die Telomere, gewährleistet. Bei der weiteren Untersuchung der molekularen Struktur des Genoms machte man die unerwartete Entdeckung, dass das eukaryotische Genom zum größten Teil nicht aus Protein-kodierenden DNA-Sequenzen besteht. Ein großer Teil der DNA-Sequenzen gehört zur repetitiven DNA, die, wie der Name schon sagt, in vielen, teils identischen, teils voneinander strukturell abweichenden, aber ähnlichen Kopien im Genom vorhanden ist. Ein Teil dieser DNA, vor allem hochrepetitive Sequenzen, ist in heterochromatischen Chromosomenabschnitten lokalisiert. Andere sind in Einzelkopien über das gesamte Genom verstreut. Die erstaunlich großen Unterschiede im DNA-Gehalt der Genome höherer Organismen müssen hauptsächlich Unterschieden in der Menge repetitiver DNA zugeschrieben werden. Sie beruhen also nicht auf wesentlichen Unterschieden in der Zahl Protein-kodierender Gene. Chromosomen sind dynamische Strukturen, die strukturell und funktionell eng mit dem Stoffwechsel und dem Differenzierungsgrad der jeweiligen Zelle verbunden sind. Ihre Bedeutung geht weit über das hinaus, was man von einem reinen „Gen-Depot“ erwarten würde. So hat die unterschiedliche Konstitution der Geschlechtschromosomen in den beiden Geschlechtern zur Folge, dass die Anzahl der Kopien der auf diesen Chromosomen gelegenen Gene im männlichen und weiblichen Geschlecht unterschiedlich ist. Solche quantitativ unbalancierten Genkonstitutionen werden in der Regel vom Organismus nicht toleriert. Verschiedene Organismengruppen haben daher spezifische Mechanismen entwickelt, um für einen funktionellen Ausgleich (Dosiskompensation) der verschiedenen Genkopienzahlen zu sorgen. In Säugetieren wird eines der beiden X-Chromosomen des weiblichen Geschlechts inaktiviert, so dass ein der hemizygoten X-Chromosomenkonstitution des männlichen Geschlechts funktionell gleichwertiger Zustand zustande kommt. In Drosophila erfolgt der Ausgleich in der Genaktivität durch erhöhte Aktivität der X-chromosomalen Gene im Männchen. Die Inaktivierung des Säuger-X-Chromosoms lässt verschiedene wesentliche biologische Mechanismen erkennen. Abgesehen von der Feststellung, dass ganze Chromosomen innerhalb eines Genoms gerichtet funktionell inaktiviert oder hyperaktiviert werden können, ist es von grundlegender Bedeutung, dass eine einmal erfolgte Inaktivierung innerhalb eines Organismus im Allgemeinen erhalten bleibt. Das Chromosom muss mithin eine Information aufnehmen, die dafür sorgt, dass es in allen folgenden Zellgenerationen inaktiv bleibt. Man bezeichnet eine solche Information als chromosomale Prägung (Imprinting). Eine weitere Konsequenz der X-Chromosomeninaktivierung ist, dass verschiedene Zellen von Säugerweibchen eine unterschiedliche Konstitution hinsichtlich der aktiven X-chromosomalen Gene besitzen können. Säugerweibchen sind daher funktionelle Mosaike in Bezug auf die Ausprägung geschlechtsgebundener Gene. Wir wissen, dass die chromosomale DNA in einer ersten Verpackungsstufe in der Form von kompakten Nukleosomen organisiert wird. Sie windet sich hierzu zweimal um einen Komplex aus Histonproteinen. Eine Kette derartiger DNA-Histonpartikel formt eine Chromatinfibrille von 10 nm Durchmesser. Diese Fibrille wird jedoch zusätzlich in Fibrillen höherer Ordnung organisiert. Aktives und inaktives Chromatin unterscheiden sich dabei in dem Ausmaß der Kondensation; Insulator-Elemente sind an der Ausbildung offener Chromatinstrukturen und an der Anheftung der Chromatiden an der Kernmembran beteiligt. Die Kompartimentierung des Zellkerns in chromosomale Territorien und Interchromatindomänen erlaubt die räumliche Trennung verschiedener funktioneller Abläufe im Zellkern, wie Transkription und Reifung der RNA.",,Genetik,748,1

Evolution of pathogens within the lifetime of a host individual is implicated as a strong selective force in the evolution of sex and aging in the host. However, this assumption or its testable predictions have not been examined empirically. We classified infectious bacteria and viruses into those that can have continued long-term existence on the host body (group 1) versus those that have only a short-term interaction during an active infection (group 2). We surveyed the literature for age-specific incidence data about infections from both the groups. The age trends of the two groups show contrasting patterns. The incidence of infections by all group 1 pathogens showed a 2.28- to 28-fold increase in older ages. In group 2, 6 out of the 9 pathogens showed a significant declining trend in incidence with age. In both groups, there was greater mortality or morbidity among the infected in the old-age classes. These patterns are better explained by pathogen evolution than by age-related decline in immunity.

Few data have been published on unselected populations. The main aim of this study was to analyse symptomatic and asymptomatic respiratory viral infections during the first year of life in a cohort of infants, recruited at birth, and the development of recurrent wheezing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 302 newborns were recruited. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was taken when the patients had a respiratory infection, as well as in the visits for vaccination at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. RT-nested PCR assays were performed to detect 16 viruses. RESULTS: A total of 1293 samples were analysed (1005 healthy controls and 288 respiratory infections). Samples taken during routine check-ups were positive in 30.8% of cases, while those with respiratory infection were positive in 77.8%, P < .001 (OR: 3, 95% CI: 2.4–3.8). A total of 239 (79%) infants had at least 1 positive respiratory viral infection detected. The most frequent virus (71%) was rhinovirus (RV). Recurrent wheezing was found in 27 (11%) children during their first year of life (1.2 episodes, SD 2.9). Recurrent wheezing was present in 58.3% of patients admitted to hospital during their first viral infection, vs. 8.6% of infants when the first infection was mild or who had asymptomatic viral detection, P < .001 (OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.05–4.5). CONCLUSIONS: In our series, severe respiratory infections leading to hospitalisation in the first months of life are risk factors for developing wheezing, but not in the case of mild RV infections.","Calvo, Cristina; Aguado, Isabel; García-García, María Luz; Ruiz-Chercoles, Esther; Díaz-Martinez, Eloisa; Albañil, Rosa María; Campelo, Olga; Olivas, Antonio; Muñóz-Gonzalez, Luisa; Pozo, Francisco; Fernandez-Arroyo, Rosa; Fernandez-Rincón, Adelaida; Calderon, Ana; Casas, Inmaculada",An Pediatr (Engl Ed),748,1

The patients had severe burn injuries and were considered to be at high-risk of both the carriage and acquisition of multi-resistant organisms (MROs). Whilst seeking to protect the Bali patients with a comprehensive infection control response, we also sought to protect other high-risk patients from nosocomial acquisition of MROs. MROs were detected from 25 (82%) of the 29 Bali patients admitted to RPH. Bali patients were colonised, or infected, with one or more of the following MROs: multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) (19 patients), extended-spectrum ß-lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram-negative bacteria (15 patients), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (nine patients), multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MRPA) (six patients), multi-resistant Chryseobacterium sp. (four patients), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (three patients). Five Bali patients developed a total of eight bacteraemic episodes, with MRPA sepsis contributing to death in two patients. Since the Bali bombings horizontal transmission of Bali MROs has occurred in 41 non-Bali patients in RPH. MRPA has had the greatest clinical impact. Eight non-Bali patients developed a total of 11 bacteraemic episodes, with MRPA sepsis contributing to death in four patients. However, apart from MRPA, we have now controlled transmission of the other MROs in RPH. The emergency response to the Bali disaster required strong leadership, good communication and multi-disciplinary teamwork. The infection control strategy contributed to good outcomes for most Bali bombing patients. However, many patients within the Bali cohort were heavily colonised with MROs, and some developed invasive infection. Subsequent nosocomial transmission of these MROs to non-Bali patients has been a legacy of the Bali tragedy.","Heath, Christopher H; Orrell, C Terri; Lee, Rosie CE; Pearman, John W; McCullough, Cheryll; Christiansen, Keryn J",Aust Infect Control,748,1

It concentrates on the interaction of the hydrophobic segment with the target cell membrane lipid bilayer and suggests the entrance of the segment into the lipid bilayer hydrophobic core as a key step in fusion. The envelope is a lipid bilayer membrane with the virus specific glycoproteins spanning it. The bilayer originates from the host cell membrane and has a lipid composition and transbilayer distribution quite similar to the host's. The viral glycoproteins have the functions of binding to the target cell surface and fusion with the cell membranes. The two functions are carried by a single glycoprotein in influenza virus (HA), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein, and Semliki Forest virus SFV E glycoprotein. In Sendai virus (HVJ), the functions are carried by separate glycoproteins, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) for binding and fusion glycoprotein (F) for fusion. When viruses encounter target cells, they first bind to the cell surface through an interaction of the viral glycoprotein with receptors.","Ohnishi, Shun-Ichi",Curr Top Membr Transp,748,1

Although enveloped viruses of different major groups vary in size and shape, as well as in the molecular weight of their structural polypeptides, there are general similarities in the types of polypeptide components present in virions. The types of structural components found in viral membranes are summarized briefly in the chapter. All the enveloped viruses studied to date possess one or more glycoprotein species and lipid as a major structural component. The presence of carbohydrate covalently linked to proteins is demonstrated by the incorporation of a radioactive precursor, such as glucosamine or fucose, into viral polypeptides, which is resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Enveloped viruses share many common features in the organization of their structural components, as indicated by several approaches, including electron microscopy, surface-labeling, and proteolytic digestion experiments, and the isolation of subviral components. The chapter summarizes the detailed structure of the glycoproteins of four virus groups: (1) influenza virus glycoproteins, (2) rhabdovirus G protein, (3) togavirus glycoprotein, and (4) paramyxovirus glycoproteins The information obtained includes the size and shape of viral glycoproteins, the number of polypeptide chains in the complete glycoprotein structure, and compositional data on the polypeptide and oligosaccharide portions of the molecules.","Compans, Richard W.; Kemp, Maurice C.",Curr Top Membr Transp,748,1

From an evolutionary standpoint, such infections are characterized at most times by low levels of the infectious agent in the systemic domain, except when multiplication has just taken place. Hence the ability for transmission of the pathogens from animals to Man will be determined by the availability of microbes to be transferred by a vector (e.g. in trypanosomiasis), or the amount of infective forms of the microbes shed into an environment (e.g. in toxoplasmosis). Using African trypanosomes, toxoplasma,Listeria and influenza A virus as examples, mechanisms by which microbes can spread and be targeted to and within the brain to cause various types of nervous system dysfunctions is reviewed. Newly revealed potentials of certain cytokines to stimulate neurons to control the growth, and even kill, microbes in their cell bodies is also described.","Kristensson, Krister",,748,1

A large number of new technologies and approaches in vaccine development are currently being investigated with the goal of providing the basis for the next generation of prophylactics against an ever-expanding list of emerging and reemerging pathogens. In this chapter, we will focus on the role of lipids and lipid self-assembling vesicles in new and promising vaccination approaches. We will start by describing how lipids can induce activation of the innate immune system and focus on some lipid-derived vaccine adjuvants. Next, we will review current lipid-based self-assembling particles used as vaccine platforms, specifically liposomes and virus-like particles, and how virus-like particles have facilitated research of highly pathogenic viruses such as Ebola.","Martinez-Gil, Luis; Goff, Peter H.; Tan, Gene S.",,748,1

The chapter focuses on virus-encoded proteinases. It gives an overall view of the use of proteolytic processing by different plant virus groups for the expression of their genomes. It also discusses that the development of full-length cDNA clones from which infectious transcripts can be produced either in vitro or in vivo, has facilitated the functional analysis of the plant virus proteinases. In spite of the high specificity of the viral proteinases, cellular substrates for animal virus proteinases have been described in this chapter. The activity of the viral proteinases can interfere with important cellular processes to favor virus replication. The recent use of proteinase inhibitors in AIDS therapy has emphasized the convenience of virus-encoded proteinases as targets of antiviral action. A mutant protein able to inhibit the activity of the TEV proteinase by manipulation of the α(2)-macroglobulin bait region was designed by Van Rompaey.","García, Juan Antonio; Fernández-Fernández, María Rosario; López-Moya, Juan José",Proteases of Infectious Agents,748,1

In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics stopped recommending IP for otherwise healthy 29–34 wGA infants, stating that their risk of RSV hospitalization (RSVH) was similar to term infants. Recent studies have demonstrated a significant decline in IP use after 2014 that was accompanied by an increased risk of RSVH in 29–34 wGA infants vs term infants. Severity and healthcare utilization of RSVH were high among 29–34 wGA infants. In 2018, the National Perinatal Association developed guidelines advocating IP use in all ≤32 wGA infants and 32–35 wGA infants with additional risk factors. Risk factor predictive models can identify infants who are at risk for RSVH and promote cost-effective use of palivizumab until new methods of RSV prevention become available.","Krilov, Leonard R.; Anderson, Evan J.",J Perinatol,748,13

The agriculture industry is one of the most challenging areas for these changes, especially in Northern Ireland, as agriculture is one of the larger industries. Research has been carried out across the island of Ireland into methods of improving farm efficiency in multiple areas of farming, including livestock health, machinery improvements, and crop growth. Research has been carried out in this study into grass growth in the dairy farming sector, specifically within Northern Ireland. Grass growth prediction aims to inform farmers and policy makers in their decision-making process regarding sustainable land management in agriculture. The present work focuses on analysing and evaluating how data-driven classifiers can be used for grass growth prediction using the data related to soil content, weather, grass quality components etc. Four classifiers, namely Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and Neural Networks, are chosen for this purpose. Classification results based on a real-world data set are analysed and compared to evaluate and illustrate the performance and robustness of the classifiers. The results indicate that it is difficult to declare a single classifier with the highest performance and robustness. Nevertheless, it indicates that tree classification methods are better suited to the data to be studied, as opposed to probabilistic methods and weighted methods, e.g., the naïve Bayes classifier obtained a predictive performance of 78% when classifying spring seasonal grass growth data.","McHugh, Orla; Liu, Jun; Browne, Fiona; Jordan, Philip; McConnell, Deborah",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,748,1

In ARDS lungs without MV support, the mechanisms and evolution of lung tissue deformation remain understudied. In this work, we quantify the progression and heterogeneity of regional strain in injured lungs under spontaneous breathing and under MV. METHODS: Lung injury was induced by lung lavage in murine subjects, followed by 3 h of spontaneous breathing (SB-group) or 3 h of low V(t) mechanical ventilation (MV-group). Micro-CT images were acquired in all subjects at the beginning and at the end of the ventilation stage following induction of lung injury. Regional strain, strain progression and strain heterogeneity were computed from image-based biomechanical analysis. Three-dimensional regional strain maps were constructed, from which a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was performed for the regional strain, the strain progression, and the strain heterogeneity. RESULTS: After 3 h of ventilation, regional strain levels were significantly higher in 43.7% of the ROIs in the SB-group. Significant increase in regional strain was found in 1.2% of the ROIs in the MV-group. Progression of regional strain was found in 100% of the ROIs in the SB-group, whereas the MV-group displayed strain progression in 1.2% of the ROIs. Progression in regional strain heterogeneity was found in 23.4% of the ROIs in the SB-group, while the MV-group resulted in 4.7% of the ROIs showing significant changes. Deformation progression is concurrent with an increase of non-aerated compartment in SB-group (from 13.3% ± 1.6% to 37.5% ± 3.1%), being higher in ventral regions of the lung. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous breathing in lung injury promotes regional strain and strain heterogeneity progression. In contrast, low V(t) MV prevents regional strain and heterogeneity progression in injured lungs.","Hurtado, Daniel E.; Erranz, Benjamín; Lillo, Felipe; Sarabia-Vallejos, Mauricio; Iturrieta, Pablo; Morales, Felipe; Blaha, Katherine; Medina, Tania; Diaz, Franco; Cruces, Pablo",Ann Intensive Care,748,1

Increased incidence of concurrent bacteremia in patients with dengue infection is a recognized complication. However, Staphylococcal endocarditis following dengue fever is uncommon. Quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) is a rare congenital anomaly and few cases of infective endocarditis have been reported in QAV. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old Sri Lankan male presented to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka with recurrence of fever and acute left hemiplegia following an uncomplicated recovery of dengue fever. He was diagnosed to have Staphylococcal infective endocarditis of quadricuspid aortic valve, with septic emboli to brain and spleen. He was managed with intravenous vancomycin initially, however, due to inadequate response, intravenous linezolid was added. He developed rhabdomyolysis with very high creatine phosphokinase leading to acute kidney injury, which settled with the cessation of linezolid. The patient succumbed to his illness despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy and maximum supportive care while being assessed for aortic valve replacement. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates three clinical issues that a clinician should be aware of. Firstly, the possibility of a serious secondary bacterial infection as a cause for recurrence of fever following dengue infection. Secondly, this case highlights the importance of identifying QAV as a cause for complicated infective endocarditis of increased severity. The report also denotes the value of being vigilant of linezolid induced rhabdomyolysis which had a causal relationship with the commencement of the drug and its cessation.","Weerasooriya, Nilusha; Fernando, Tharanga; Serasinghe, Pasan; Alahakoon, Buddhika; Madurapperuma, Chirath; Jayanaga, Ananda",BMC Infect Dis,748,1

The main problems connected with the organization of distance learning, such as the availability and accessibility of electricity and stable communications, were described. The main questions connected with the support of e-learning such as unequal access to distance education platforms and tools and readiness of teachers of public and private schools were described. Key social and demographic challenges and threats to sustainable e-learning, such as critical overload of teachers, child mobilization for domestic tasks, age, ethnic and gender-based harassment and violence were analyzed. It was found that the main risks are the rapid and uncontrolled commercialization of education and the decline of public schools, which leads to a decrease in the quality of education and increasing inequality. It was concluded that pandemic-induced risks in education are non-linear and heterogeneously spatially, temporally, and socially distributed.

To fill this gap, a novel time-delayed fractional grey model is developed to forecast the natural gas consumption concerning time-delayed effect. Theoretical analysis shows it has more general formulation, unbiasedness and higher flexibility than the existing similar model. Being optimized by the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, the proposed model presents higher accuracy in four validation cases.

A total of ten highly referenced and experimentally validated epitopes were selected from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), followed by their conservancy analysis using weblogos. The consensus sequences and variants derived from these sequences were examined, for their binding affinities, with prevalent HLA alleles of Pakistan. Moreover, the antigenic and allergenic natures of these peptides were also evaluated via Vaxijen and AllerTOP, respectively. Consequently, all potentially allergenic and non-antigenic, peptide fragments, were excluded from the analysis. Among all putative epitopes, three CD8 + T-cell epitopes were selected, as ideal vaccine candidates and, population coverage analysis revealed that the combination of these three peptides was covering, 67.28% Pakistani Asian and 57.15% mixed Pakistani populations. Likewise, eleven linear and six conformational or discontinuous B-cell epitopes were also marked as potential vaccine candidates based on their prediction score, non-allergenic nature, and antigenic properties. These epitopes, however, need the final validation via wet-lab studies. After their approval, these epitopes would be effective candidates for the future designing of epitope-based vaccines against Mtb infections in Pakistan.

However, being sensitive in nature, there are stringent legal requirements related to the sharing and processing of personal health data. There is a growing trend of using Personal Information Management System (PIMS) to gather, store, manage, and provide secure and privacy-aware access to personal data. Recently, blockchain technology has emerged as a lucrative option for personal health information management. In this chapter, we propose a layered architecture for a blockchain-based PIMS for managing data originating from medical IoT devices. The proposed architecture has four layers as follows: (1) A blockchain layer that provides functionality to implement and host blockchain database; (2) An IoT device layer that consists of electronic data devices such as health watch, weighing scale, and blood pressure measurement sensors; (3) An application layer that collects data from the health devices and displays consolidated data view to the user; and (4) An adapter layer that has a responsibility of interfacing an application layer with the blockchain layer. The proposed architecture is extensible to accommodate additional electronic devices and services and it is also language and platform agnostic. We are currently building a Proof of Concept (PoC) prototype for validating proposed architecture using Hyperledger Fabric platform.","Pawar, Pravin; Edoh, Thierry Oscar; Singh, Madhusudan; Parolia, Neeraj",Blockchain Technology for IoT Applications,748,1

Therefore, a book recommendation system that suits their behavior habits is required. In order to provide accurate and effective book sets for users, we propose an algorithm based on fusing their preferences. For intelligently ranking the candidate book sets and help users find the right book quickly, we propose a context-aware algorithm based on users’ attention. Meanwhile, we introduce an improved calculation method for users’ attention to solving the problem of inaccurate prediction on users’ current attention when their action history is cluttered. We use the self-attention to preserve the users’ reading tendencies during the reading process, analyze users’ personal features and book content features, and improve the accuracy of the recommendation by merging the feature space.

Jet impingement is widely implemented, since it ensures high average heat transfer coefficients and the uniformity of the temperature over the target surface. However, the flow generated depends on several parameters related to the jet flow, such as jet velocity and temperature, and the target plate geometry. Complex impinging surfaces are identified in the majority of the applications, such as reflow soldering and cooling of turbines or solar systems. To increase the process efficiency, it is important to fully understand the interactions between the jet and the target surface. Considering the interest of this field, the present study is conducted to investigate the influence of the target surface on heat transfer in a single jet impingement process. To minimize the number of experiments, decreasing time and costs, the implementation of numerical tools is fundamental. In that sense, the impingement of the hot air jet over a flat and non-flat plate was predicted numerically using the ANSYS FLUENT software. The velocity and temperature profile were analyzed and the Nusselt number were compared for both cases. The results show the complexity of the flow generated in the vicinity of the step and the changes of the jet flow structure when it impinges a complex surface.","Barbosa, Flávia V.; Teixeira, Senhorinha F.

Non-deterministic or incompletely known causal laws may only determine conditional probabilities or occurrence rates for consequences from known conditions (Spirtes 2010). For example, different exposure concentrations of air pollution might cause different mortality incidence rates or age-specific hazard rates for people with different values of causally relevant covariates. A defining characteristic of sound science is that causal laws and their predictions are formulated and expressed unambiguously, using clear operational definitions, so that they can be independently tested and verified by others and empirically confirmed, refuted, or refined as needed using new data as it becomes available. Comparing unambiguous predictions to observations (using statistics if the predictions are probabilistic) determines the extent to which they are empirically supported. The authority of valid scientific conclusions rests on their testability, potential falsifiability, and empirically demonstrated predictive validity when tested. Using new data to constantly question, test, verify, and if necessary correct and refine previous predictive generalizations, and wider theories and networks of assumptions into which they may fit, is a hallmark of sound science. Its practical benefit in risk analysis is better understanding of what truly protects people, and what does not—for example, the unexpected discovery that administering retinol and beta carotene to subjects at risk of lung cancer increased risk instead of decreasing it (Omenn et al. 1996; Goodman et al. 2004).","Cox Jr., Louis Anthony",Quantitative Risk Analysis of Air Pollution Health Effects,748,1

However, the role of hormone therapy as a prognostic factor of suicide risk is largely unknown. OBJECTIVES To examine associations between menopausal hormone therapy, suicide attempts, and suicide among midlife and older women Veterans. RESEARCH DESIGN In this longitudinal analysis of national Veterans Health Administration data from women Veterans aged 50 years and above, we used Fine-Gray proportional hazards models to examine associations between menopausal hormone therapy (prescribed in 2012-2013) and incident suicide attempts and suicide (index date-2016). MEASURES Menopausal hormone therapy and psychoactive medications from pharmacy records; suicide attempts and suicide from national suicide data repositories; demographic variables, medical and psychiatric diagnoses, and substance use disorders from electronic medical record data and International Classification Diagnoses-9-CM codes. RESULTS In this national sample of 291,709 women Veterans (mean age 60.47, SD 9.81), 6% were prescribed menopausal hormone therapy at baseline. Over an average of 4.5 years, 2673 had an incident suicide attempt (93%) or death by suicide (7%). Adjusting for age, race, and medical diagnoses, menopausal hormone therapy was associated with increased risk of suicide attempt (hazard ratio 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-1.64) and over 2-fold increased risk of death by suicide (hazard ratio 2.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.58-3.87). Associations with death by suicide remained significant after accounting for psychiatric comorbidity and psychoactive medications. CONCLUSIONS Menopausal hormone therapy may be an important indicator of suicide risk among midlife and older women.","Gibson, Carolyn J; Li, Yixia; Jasuja, Guneet K; Self, Kyle J; Seal, Karen H; Byers, Amy L",Medical care,748,1

Teleworkers were also asked to provide information about their current work routine, home environment and clinical history.ResultsAt the DASS-21, 30% of the participants presented pathological levels of depression, 20.8% of anxiety and 30.7% of stress. At the ISI, 5% appeared to suffer from insomnia. Respondents with psychological and physical frailties, greater social isolation or inadequate working spaces manifested higher levels of psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, we also find a correlation of these symptoms with occupations in education. Telework was broadly appreciated and 87% of respondents expressed a willingness to maintain access to this arrangement.ConclusionsOur results document that about a third of our sample manifested psychopathological symptoms while teleworking during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. However, telework itself does not seem to be directly associated with increased psychiatric symptoms, which were instead exacerbated by COVID-19-related stressful circumstances, as well as by constitutional and social determinants of health.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey targeting OTO-HNS program directors (PD) was created and disseminated via email to PDs on May 28th 2020. Descriptive analyses of the 19-question survey was performed, and free text responses for certain suitable questions were thematically categorized into groups determined to be relevant during analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of 123 solicited PDs (23.6%) completed the survey. Nineteen (65.5%) respondents indicated they would not host away rotations (AR) in 2020, and 9 (31.0%) reported that they would consider away rotators without home programs. Regarding the historical importance of AR, 21 (72.4%) PDs stated they were either ""extremely"" or ""very"" important in evaluating candidates. Sixteen (55.2%) PDs stated that virtual interviews would impact their ability to properly gauge candidates and 12 (41.4%) were unsure. Eight PDs (27.6%) stated their evaluation of candidates will likely change, with a shift toward an increased reliance on letters of recommendation, research involvement, and clerkship grades. The large majority of PDs-25 (86.2%)-were not worried that the COVID-19 pandemic would affect the abilities of new interns beginning in 2021. CONCLUSION: Virtual interviews and engagement activities will mostly supplant sub-Is and AR for the 2020-2021 OTO-HNS application cycle. Surveyed PDs largely believe these will be insufficient in providing a comprehensive assessment of candidates, and will similarly limit applicants' ability to gauge residency programs.

Non-critical patients (nâ¯=â¯186) with varying degrees of COVID-19 severity reported persistent symptoms using a standardized questionnaire and underwent pulmonary function and 6-minute walk testing between 30 and 90 days following the onset of acute COVID-19 symptoms. Patients were divided into those with (nâ¯=â¯70) and without (nâ¯=â¯116) persistent dyspnoea. Patients with persistent dyspnoea had significantly lower FVC (pâ¯=â¯0.03), FEV1 (pâ¯=â¯0.04), DLCO (pâ¯=â¯0.01), 6-minute walk distance (% predicted, pâ¯=â¯0.03), and end-exercise oxygen saturation (pâ¯<â¯0.001), and higher Borg 0-10 ratings of dyspnoea and fatigue (both pâ¯<â¯0.001) compared to patients without persistent dyspnoea. We have shown that dyspnoea is a common persistent symptom across varying degrees of initial COVID-19 severity. Patients with persistent dyspnoea had greater restriction on spirometry, lower DLCO, reduced functional capacity, and increased exertional desaturation and symptoms. This suggests that there is a true physiological mechanism that may explain persistent dyspnoea after COVID-19.","Cortés-Telles, Arturo; López-Romero, Stephanie; Figueroa-Hurtado, Esperanza; Pou-Aguilar, Yuri Noemi; Wong, Alyson W; Milne, Kathryn M; Ryerson, Christopher J; Guenette, Jordan A",Respir Physiol Neurobiol,748,16

It is an infectious disease (R0: 2.2 to 3.3) with confirmed human-to-human transmission. The high morbidity and mortality attributed to viral infection has overwhelmed the health systems of most countries across the globe. As of now, there is no confirmed treatment or vaccine against COVID-19. The current pharmacological management relies only on supportive care. Therefore, only non-pharmacological approaches are left to protect people from infection. Established preventive methods against infection include dodging the exposure from the virus, which will break the chain of transmission and prevent further human-to-human spread.

Obesity affects lung volume, with a decrease in expiratory reserve volume, which is associated with a decrease in lung and chest wall compliance, an increase in airway resistance, and an increase in work of breathing. Obesity affects cardiac structure and hemodynamics. Obesity is a risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular disorders. Moreover, obesity is associated with a low-grade inflammatory state, endothelial dysfunction, hyperinsulinemia, and metabolic disorders. Obesity is associated with severe COVID-19 and invasive mechanical ventilation. These previous cardiopulmonary pathological aspects may explain the clinical severity in obese patients with COVID-19.

Understanding current patterns of the pandemic spread and forecasting its long-term trajectory is essential in guiding policies aimed at curtailing the pandemic. This is particularly important in regions with weak economies and fragile health care systems such as West Africa. We formulate and use a deterministic compartmental model to (i) assess the current patterns of COVID-19 spread in West Africa, (ii) evaluate the impact of currently implemented control measures, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in West Africa. An analytical expression for the threshold level of control measures (involving a reduction in the effective contact rate) required to curtail the pandemic is computed. Considering currently applied health control measures, numerical simulations of the model using baseline parameter values estimated from West African COVID-19 data project a 67% reduction in the daily number of cases when the epidemic attains its peak. More reduction in the number of cases will be achieved if additional public health control measures that result in a reduction in the effective contact rate are implemented. We found out that disease elimination is difficult when more asymptomatic individuals contribute in transmission or are not identified and isolated in a timely manner. However, maintaining a baseline level of asymptomatic isolation and a low transmission rate will lead to a significant reduction in the number of daily cases when the pandemic peaks. For example, at the baseline level of asymptomatic isolation, at least a 46% reduction in the transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Additionally, disease elimination is possible if asymptomatic individuals are identified and isolated within 5 days (after the incubation period). Combining two or more measures is better for disease control, e.g., if asymptomatic cases are contact traced or identified and isolated in less than 8 days, only about 29% reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Furthermore, we showed that the currently implemented measures triggered a 33% reduction in the time-dependent effective reproduction number between February 28 and June 26, 2020. We conclude that curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic burden significantly in West Africa requires more control measures than those that have already been implemented, as well as more mass testing and contact tracing in order to identify and isolate asymptomatic individuals early.","Taboe, Hémaho B; Salako, Kolawolé V; Tison, James M; Ngonghala, Calistus N; Glèlè Kakaï, Romain",Math Biosci,748,0

As a special group, pregnant and lying-in women must pay close attention to their physical and mental health, as both have consequences for the mother and the fetus. However, knowledge regarding the status of depression, anxiety and insomnia among these women is limited. AIM: This study aimed to examine insomnia and psychological factors among pregnant and lying-in women during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide theoretical support for intervention research. METHODS: In total, 2235 pregnant and lying-in women from 12 provinces in China were surveyed; their average age was 30.25 years (SD = 3.99, range = 19-47 years). PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The participants completed electronic questionnaires designed to collect demographic information and assess levels of depression, anxiety and insomnia. RESULTS: The prevalence of insomnia in the sample was 18.9%. Depression and anxiety were significant predictors of insomnia. Participants in high-risk areas, those with a disease history, those with economic losses due to the outbreak, and those in the postpartum period had significantly higher insomnia scores. DISCUSSION: The incidence of insomnia among pregnant and lying-in women is not serious in the context of the epidemic, which may be related to the sociocultural background and current epidemic situation in China. CONCLUSION: Depression and anxiety are more indicative of insomnia than demographic variables.","Wang, Jiazhou; Zhou, Yongjie; Qian, Wei; Zhou, Yueyue; Han, Ru; Liu, Zhengkui",Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol,748,16

In particular, we compare countries that imposed a nationwide lockdown (Treatment group); Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom (UK), and the US, to Sweden (Control group) that did not impose national lockdown using a changes-in-changes (CIC) estimation model. The key advantage of the CIC model as compared to the standard difference-in-difference model is that CIC allows for mean and variance of the outcomes to change over time in the absence of any policy intervention, and CIC accounts for endogeneity in the choice of policy intervention. Our results indicate that in contrast to Sweden, which did not impose a national lockdown, Germany, and to some extent, the US were the two countries where nationwide lockdown had a significant impact on the reduction in COVID-19 related total and daily deaths per million people. In Norway and Denmark, there was no significant impact on total and daily deaths per million people relative to Sweden. Whereas in other countries; Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK, the effect of the lockdown was in the opposite direction, that is, they experienced significantly higher COVID-19 related total and daily deaths per million people, post the lockdown as compared to Sweden. Our results suggest that the impact of nationwide lockdown on COVID-19 related total and daily deaths per million people varied from one country to another.","Kapoor, Mudit; Ravi, Shamika",,748,1

Virus entry into cells depends on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S). Although there is no vaccine, it is likely that antibodies will be essential for protection. However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-21-5. Here we report on 149 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. Plasmas collected an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal pseudovirus neutralizing titres: less than 1:50 in 33% and below 1:1,000 in 79%, while only 1% showed titres above 1:5,000. Antibody sequencing revealed expanded clones of RBD-specific memory B cells expressing closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titres, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on RBD neutralized at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) as low as single digit nanograms per millitre. Thus, most convalescent plasmas obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective.","Robbiani, Davide F; Gaebler, Christian; Muecksch, Frauke; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Wang, Zijun; Cho, Alice; Agudelo, Marianna; Barnes, Christopher O; Gazumyan, Anna; Finkin, Shlomo; Hägglöf, Thomas; Oliveira, Thiago Y; Viant, Charlotte; Hurley, Arlene; Hoffmann, Hans-Heinrich; Millard, Katrina G; Kost, Rhonda G; Cipolla, Melissa; Gordon, Kristie; Bianchini, Filippo; Chen, Spencer T; Ramos, Victor; Patel, Roshni; Dizon, Juan; Shimeliovich, Irina; Mendoza, Pilar; Hartweger, Harald; Nogueira, Lilian; Pack, Maggi; Horowitz, Jill; Schmidt, Fabian; Weisblum, Yiska; Michailidis, Eleftherios; Ashbrook, Alison W; Waltari, Eric; Pak, John E; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E; Koranda, Nicholas; Hoffman, Pauline R; West, Anthony P; Rice, Charles M; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bjorkman, Pamela J; Bieniasz, Paul D; Caskey, Marina; Nussenzweig, Michel C",Nature (Lond.),748,30

The lockdown or quarantine measures adopted to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has caused the interruption in ongoing care and access to medical care including to patients with existing neurological conditions. Besides the passivity, isolation, and withdrawal, patients with neurodegenerative diseases experience difficulties in communication due to a limited access to leisure opportunities and interaction with friends and relatives. The communication difficulties may exacerbate the burden on the caregivers. Therefore, assistive-technologies may be a useful strategy in mitigating challenges associated with remote communication. The current paper presents an overview of the use of assistive technologies using virtual reality and virtual body ownership in providing communication opportunities to isolated patients, during COVID-19, with neurological diseases and moderate-to-severe communication difficulties. We postulate that the assistive technologies-based intervention may improve social interactions in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and acquired brain injury-thereby reducing isolation and improving their quality of life and mental well-being.","Stasolla, Fabrizio; Matamala-Gomez, Marta; Bernini, Sara; Caffò, Alessandro O; Bottiroli, Sara",Front Public Health,748,12

This included scheduled outpatient cardiac surgical and interventional procedures that required the use of intensive care units, ventilators, and skilled critical care personnel, given that these procedures would draw from the same pool of resources required for critically ill COVID-19 patients. We adapted the COVID-19 Resource Estimator (CORE) decision analytic model by adding a cardiac component to determine the impact of various policy decisions on the incremental waitlist growth and estimated waitlist mortality for three key groups of cardiovascular disease patients; coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmias. We provided predictions based on COVID-19 epidemiology available in real-time, in 3 phases. First, in the initial crisis phase, in a worst case scenario, we showed that the potential number of waitlist related cardiac deaths would be orders of magnitude less than those who would die of COVID-19 if critical cardiac care resources were diverted to the care of COVID-19 patients. Second, with better local epidemiology data, we predicted that across five regions of Ontario, there may be insufficient resources to resume all elective outpatient cardiac procedures. Finally in the recovery phase, we showed that the estimated incremental growth in waitlist for all cardiac procedures is likely substantial. These outputs informed timely, data-driven decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the provision of cardiovascular care.","Tam, Derrick Y; Naimark, David; Natarajan, Madhu K; Woodward, Graham; Oakes, Garth; Rahal, Mirna; Barrett, Kali; Khan, Yasin A; Ximenes, Raphael; Mac MBiotech, Stephen; Sander, Beate; Wijeysundera, Harindra C",Can. j. cardiol,748,12

We evaluated the feasibility of performing nanofiltration of platelet lysates and determined the impact on expansion of bone marrow-derived MSCs. METHODS: Platelet lysates were prepared by freeze-thawing of pathogen-reduced (Intercept) PCs suspended in 65% storage solution (SPP+) and 35% plasma, and by serum-conversion of PCs suspended in 100% plasma. Lysates were added to the MSC growth media at 10% (v/v), filtered and subjected to cascade nanofiltration on 35- and 19-nm Planova filters. Media supplemented with 10% starting platelet lysates or FBS were used as the controls. Impacts of nanofiltration on the growth media composition, removal of platelet extracellular vesicles (PEVs) and MSC expansion were evaluated. RESULTS: Nanofiltration did not detrimentally affect contents of total protein and growth factors or the biochemical composition. The clearance factor of PEVs was >3 log values. Expansion, proliferation, membrane markers, differentiation potential and immunosuppressive properties of cells in nanofiltered media were consistently better than those expanded in FBS-supplemented media. Compared with FBS, chondrogenesis and osteogenesis genes were expressed more in nanofiltered media, and there were fewer senescent cells over six passages. CONCLUSIONS: Nanofiltration of growth media supplemented with two types of platelet lysates, including one prepared from pathogen-reduced PCs, is technically feasible. These data support the possibility of developing pathogen-reduced xeno-free growth media for clinical-grade propagation of human cells.","Barro, Lassina; Nebie, Ouada; Chen, Ming-Sheng; Wu, Yu-Wen; Koh, Mickey Bc; Knutson, Folke; Watanabe, Naoto; Takahara, Masayasu; Burnouf, Thierry",Cytotherapy,748,26

The influence of such formulaic disease modelling has pervaded public health policy and practice during the Covid-19 pandemic. The critical vocabulary of epidemiology, and now popular debate, thus includes R0, the basic reproduction number of the virus, 'flattening the curve', and epidemic 'waves'. How did this happen? What are the consequences of framing and foreseeing the pandemic in these modes? Focusing on historical and contemporary disease responses, primarily in Britain, I explore the emergence of statistical modelling as a 'crisis technology', a reductive mechanism for making rapid decisions or judgments under uncertain biological constraint. I consider how Covid-19 might be configured or assembled otherwise, constituted as a more heterogeneous object of knowledge, a different and more encompassing moment of truth - not simply as a measured telos directing us to a new normal. Drawing on earlier critical engagements with the AIDS pandemic, inquiries into how to have 'theory' and 'promiscuity' in a crisis, I seek to open up a space for greater ecological, sociological, and cultural complexity in the biopolitics of modelling, thereby attempting to validate a role for critique in the Covid-19 crisis.","Anderson, Warwick",Soc Stud Sci,748,1

Here we investigated the associations between pandemic-related income loss with financial strain and mental health trajectories over a 1-month course, in two independent cohorts. METHODS: Two independent studies were conducted in the U.S and in Israel at the beginning of the outbreak (March-April 2020, T1; study I: N = 2904, study II: N = 1267) and at a 1-month follow-up (T2; study I: N = 1318, study II: N = 241). Mixed-effects models were applied to assess associations among COVID-19-related income loss, financial strain, and pandemic-related worries about health, with anxiety and depression, controlling for multiple covariates including pre-COVID-19 income. RESULTS: In both studies, income loss and financial strain were associated with greater depressive symptoms at T1, above and beyond T1 anxiety, worries about health, and pre-COVID-19 income. Worsening of income loss was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in both studies. Worsening of subjective financial strain was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in one study (US). CONCLUSIONS: Income loss and financial strain were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms and their exacerbation over time, above and beyond pandemic-related anxiety.

We observe formation of supramolecular clusters or nuclei preceding growth into phase-separated droplets. Short hexanucleotide NA forms compact 2:2 N-protein/NA complexes with reduced disorder. Longer oligonucleotides expose additional N-protein interactions and multi-valent protein-NA interactions, which generate higher-order mixed oligomers and simultaneously promote growth of droplets. Phase separation is accompanied by a significant change in protein secondary structure, different from that caused by initial NA binding, which may contribute to the assembly of ribonucleoprotein particles within macromolecular condensates.","Zhao, Huaying; Wu, Di; Nguyen, Ai; Li, Yan; Adão, Regina C; Valkov, Eugene; Patterson, George H; Piszczek, Grzegorz; Schuck, Peter",iScience,748,24

The attached oligosaccharide chain is subjected to stepwise trimming by the actions of specific glucosidases and mannosidases. In these processes, the transiently expressed N-glycans, as processing intermediates, function as signals for the determination of glycoprotein fates, i.e., folding, transport, or degradation through interactions of a series of intracellular lectins. The monoglucosylated glycoforms are hallmarks of incompletely folded states of glycoproteins in this system, whereas the outer mannose trimming leads to ER-associated glycoprotein degradation. This review outlines the recently emerging evidence regarding the molecular and structural basis of this glycoprotein quality control system, which is regulated through dynamic interplay among intracellular lectins, glycosidases, and glycosyltransferase. Structural snapshots of carbohydrate-lectin interactions have been provided at the atomic level using X-ray crystallographic analyses. Conformational ensembles of uncomplexed triantennary high-mannose-type oligosaccharides have been characterized in a quantitative manner using molecular dynamics simulation in conjunction with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Part of the coronavirus challenges is the various spiritual undertones attributed to it in many quarters. Hence, this study seeks to understand the various spiritual undertones attributed to the coronavirus incidence in southwest Nigeria. METHODOLOGY: This paper examined the coronavirus pandemic and spirituality sociologically in southwest Nigeria, using secondary and primary data. Secondary data includes a review of literature, social media comments, official records, and newspaper reports. Primary data entails using google form (questionnaire) circulated via social media with 221 responses retrieved and analyzed using the frequency distribution tables and bar charts. Also, a one-sample t-test was used for further statistical analysis. RESULTS: Findings show that rather than attributing coronavirus incidence to spirituality alone, most of the respondents also see it as a public health concern, and precautionary measures should adhere. They see the government ban on social gathering, which affected the religious houses as the right thing to do and not solely targeted as religious houses. However, most believe that religious houses provide 'essential' emotional and spiritual support to the people. Respondents also believe they can get their healing from their place of worship even if infected with the coronavirus. CONCLUSION: Based on the findings it was recommended that religious organizations should source valid data so that policy-makers can make informed decisions. Also, there is a need to have an accurate record of the number of infected persons and death rates to know the right time to ease lockdown and lift the social gathering measures. There should also be a place for easy and free testing for people. This will help the government ascertain the number of infected persons, reduce the associated fear with the pandemic, and lessen the people's economic, social, and religious effects.","Olonade, Olawale Y.; Adetunde, Christiana O.; Iwelumor, Oluwakemi S.; Ozoya, Mercy I.; George, Tayo O.",Heliyon,748,16
