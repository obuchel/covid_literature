Due to hesitation toward the vaccine, it is crucial to explore the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine to the public and healthcare workers. In this cross-sectional survey, we invited 2251 pediatricians and 506 (22%) of them responded survey and 424 (84%) gave either nasopharyngeal swap or antibody assay for COVID-19 and 71 (14%) of them got diagnosis of COVID-19. If the effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine was launched on market, 420 (83%) of pediatrician accepted to get vaccine shot, 422 (83%) of them recommended vaccination to their family members, 380 (75%) of them accepted to vaccine their children and 445 (85%) of them offered vaccination to their pediatric patients. Among the participated pediatricians 304 (60%) of them thought COVID-19 vaccine should be mandatory. We found that there are high COVID-19 vaccine willingness rates for pediatricians for themselves, their own children, family members and their pediatric patients. We also found that being a pediatric subspecialist, believing in achieving an effective vaccine, willingness to participate in the phase 1-2 clinical vaccine trial, willingness to get an influenza shot this season, believing a vaccine and vaccine passport should be mandatory were significant factors in accepting the vaccine. It is important to share all information about COVID-19 vaccines, especially effectiveness and safety, with the public in a clear communication and transparency. The opposite will contribute to vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccine movement.","Gönüllü, Erdem; Soysal, Ahmet; Atıcı, Serkan; Engin, Mesut; Yeşilbaş, Osman; Kasap, Tuba; Fedakar, Atiye; Bilgiç, Emre; Tavil, Emine Betül; Tutak, Ercan; Yıldız, İsmail; Akçay, Teoman; Ağladıoğlu, Sebahat Yılmaz; Tunç, Turan; Can, İlkay; Karaböcüoğlu, Metin; Karabayır, Nalan",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1896319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861165/,761

Often it leads to hemodynamic disturbances, which may have a significant effect in patients with limited cardiopulmonary reserve as well as with cerebrovascular diseases. Aims The aim of the study was to evaluate whether there is a clinically relevant difference between the circulatory responses to oral and nasal fiberoptic intubation. Settings and Design This was a prospective, randomized, and comparative study. Materials and Methods In this study, a total of 90 patients with the American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status I and II of either sex in the age group of 18-60 years and having anticipated difficult airway (DA) posted for elective surgery under general anesthesia were randomly allocated into two groups. Patients underwent fiberoptic intubation via either oral or nasal route under sevoflurane anesthesia with bispectral index guidance. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), time taken to intubation, and need of maneuver were measured. Statistical Analysis Used All the analyses were carried out on SPSS 16.0 version (Inc., Chicago, USA). Mean and standard deviation were calculated. The test of analysis between two groups was done by unpaired t-test. Results Demographic and DA characteristics were similar in both the groups. Significantly (P < 0.01) lesser alteration in HR, SBP, DBP, and MAP was seen in oral fiberoptic intubation when compared to nasal fiberoptic intubation in the early phase of postintubation. Time taken to intubation was also significantly (P < 0.01) lesser in the oral route compared to the nasal route. Conclusions Oral fiberoptic intubation causes less hemodynamic alteration and takes less time in comparison to nasal fiberoptic intubation.","Chahar, Jitendra Singh; Das, Pravin Kumar; Dubey, Rakesh K; Malviya, Deepak; Harjai, Mamta; Rastogi, Shivani","Anesthesia, essays and researches",https://doi.org/10.4103/aer.aer_6_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32843798/,761

83214,Magnetic Resonance for Noninvasive Detection of Microcirculatory Disease Associated With Allograft Vasculopathy: Intracoronary Measurement Validation.,2015,"BACKGROUND The contribution of increasing numbers of deaths from suicide, alcohol-related and drug-related causes to changes in overall mortality rates has been highlighted in various countries. In Scotland, particular vulnerable cohorts have been shown to be most at risk; however, it is unclear to what extent this applies elsewhere in Britain. The aim here was to compare mortality rates for different birth cohorts between Scotland and England and Wales (E&W), including key cities. METHODS Mortality and population data (1981-2017) for Scotland, E&W and 10 cities were obtained from national statistical agencies. Ten-year birth cohorts and cohort-specific mortality rates (by age of death, sex, cause) were derived and compared between countries and cities. RESULTS Similarities were observed between countries and cities in terms of peak ages of death, and the cohorts with the highest death rates. However, cohort-specific rates were notably higher in Scotland, particularly for alcohol-related and drug-related deaths. Across countries and cities, those born in 1965-1974 and 1975-1984 had the highest drug-related mortality rates (peak age at death: 30-34 years); the 1965-1974 birth cohort also had the highest male suicide rate (peak age: 40-44 years). For alcohol-related causes, the highest rates were among earlier cohorts (1935-1944, 1945-1954, 1955-1964)-peak age 60-64 years. CONCLUSIONS The overall similarities suggest common underlying influences across Britain; however, their effects have been greatest in Scotland, confirming greater vulnerability among that population. In addressing the socioeconomic drivers of deaths from these causes, the cohorts identified here as being at greatest risk require particular attention.","Walsh, David; McCartney, Gerry; Minton, Jon; Parkinson, Jane; Shipton, Deborah; Whyte, Bruce",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-216220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045325/,761
84042,Detection of Pulmonary Shunts by Transcranial Doppler in Hospitalized Non-mechanically Ventilated Coronavirus Disease-19 Patients.,2021-01-11,"Older adults have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many outbreaks occurring in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs). We discuss this vulnerability among LTCF residents using an ecological framework, on levels spanning from the individual to families and caregivers, institutions, health services and systems, communities, and contextual government policies. Challenges abound for fully understanding the burden of COVID-19 in LTCF, including differences in nomenclature, data collection systems, cultural differences, varied social welfare models, and (often) under-resourcing of the LTC sector. Registration of cases and deaths may be limited by testing capacity and policy, record-keeping and reporting procedures. Hospitalization and death rates may be inaccurate depending on atypical presentations and whether or not residents' goals of care include escalation of care and transfer to hospital. Given the important contribution of frailty, use of the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is discussed as a readily implementable measure, as are lessons learned from the study of frailty in relation to influenza. Biomarkers hold emerging promise in helping to predict disease severity and address the puzzle of why some frail LTCF residents are resilient to COVID-19, either remaining test-negative despite exposure or having asymptomatic infection, while others experience the full range of illness severity including critical illness and death. Strong and coordinated surveillance and research focused on LTCFs and their frail residents is required. These efforts should include widespread assessment of frailty using feasible and readily implementable tools such as the CFS, and rigorous reporting of morbidity and mortality in LTCFs.","Andrew, Melissa; Searle, Samuel D; McElhaney, Janet E; McNeil, Shelly A; Clarke, Barry; Rockwood, Kenneth; Kelvin, David J",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32525825/,761
85349,[Dr. Tomisaku Kawasaki (1925-2020) and his legacy in Latin America].,2020-08-01,"S. epidermidis is responsible for biofilm-related nonunions. This study compares the response to S. epidermidis-infected fractures in rats systemically or locally injected with vancomycin or bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in preventing the nonunion establishment. The 50% of rats receiving BMSCs intravenously (s-rBMSCs) died after treatment. A higher cytokine trend was measured in BMSCs locally injected rats (l-rBMSCs) at day 3 and in vancomycin systemically injected rats (l-VANC) at day 7 compared to the other groups. At day 14, the highest cytokine values were measured in l-VANC and in l-rBMSCs for IL-10. µCT showed a good bony bridging in s-VANC and excellent both in l-VANC and in l-rBMSCs. The bacterial growth was lower in s-VANC and l-VANC than in l-rBMSCs. Histology demonstrated the presence of new woven bone in s-VANC and a more mature bony bridging was found in l-VANC. The l-rBMSCs showed a poor bony bridging of fibrovascular tissue. Our results could suggest the synergic use of systemic and local injection of vancomycin as an effective treatment to prevent septic nonunions. This study cannot sustain the systemic injection of BMSCs due to high risks, while a deeper insight into local BMSCs immunomodulatory effects is mandatory before developing cell therapies in clinics.","Lovati, Arianna B; Drago, Lorenzo; Bottagisio, Marta; Bongio, Matilde; Ferrario, Marzia; Perego, Silvia; Sansoni, Veronica; De Vecchi, Elena; Romanò, Carlo L",Mediators of inflammation,https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/9595706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27478310/,761
88877,Views of patients with inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: ACCU survey results.,2020-12-29,"The aim of this study was to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in neurosyphilis (NS), analyze the differences between asymptomatic NS (ANS) and symptomatic NS (SNS), and explore the diagnostic value of these cytokines. We enrolled 45 patients with a diagnosis of NS, including 18 patients with ANS and 27 patients with SNS, whose cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected before penicillin therapy. Twelve patients with syphilis but non-NS (NNS) were also included. We measured the CSF levels of interleukin- (IL-) 1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-21, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) α; the CSF levels of the microglial activation marker soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2); and the CSF levels of the neuronal injury marker neurofilament light proteins (NFL) using the human cytokine multiplex assay or ELISA. Of the measured cytokines in the CSF, only IL-10 levels were significantly increased in NS patients compared to NNS patients (p < 0.001). In a subgroup analysis, the CSF levels of IL-10 were significantly elevated in SNS patients compared to ANS and NNS patients (p = 0.024 and p < 0.001, respectively). The CSF IL-10 levels had a significant correlation with the markers of microglial activation and neuronal injury, and they also correlated with CSF rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer, CSF white blood cell (WBC) count, and CSF protein concentration. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of CSF IL-10 in the diagnosis of NS and ANS were 0.920 and 0.891, respectively. The corresponding sensitivities/specificities were 86.7%/91.7% and 83.3%/91.7%, respectively. Therefore, the excessive production of IL-10 might facilitate bacterial persistent infection, play an important role in the pathogenesis of NS, and associate with the progression of the disease. CSF IL-10 concentration had a useful value in the diagnosis of NS, especially in ANS.","Li, Wurong; Wu, Wenqing; Chang, Haoxiao; Jiang, Meijuan; Gao, Junhua; Xu, Yun; Xu, Dongmei; Yin, Linlin; Zhang, Xinghu",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3812671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083463/,761

At two centers, 42 patients underwent RAPN. Radius, Exo/Endophytic, Nearness, Anterior/Posterior, Location (R.E.N.A.L.) nephrometry and PADUA scores of patients were calculated by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Intra- and perioperative (0-30 days) complications were evaluated using modified Clavien classification. A four-arm da Vinci-S robotic surgical system was used and outcomes were evaluated retrospectively. Mean age of the patients was 52.3 ± 6.5 years. Mean tumor size was 3.1 ± 1.0 (1.4-6.6) cm. R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry and PADUA scores were 6.0 ± 1.5 and 7.5 ± 0.9, respectively. Mean surgical time was 127.7 ± 18.7 minutes and estimated blood loss was 100 ± 18.1 cc. Mean warm ischemia time was 16.0 ± 8.9 (0-30) minutes. Intraoperative complications did not develop in any patient. Median hospital stay was 3.0 (2-6) days. Except for 17 patients, hilar clamping was performed in 25 patients. Histopathology results included 34 renal cell carcinoma (22 clear cell, 7 chromophobe cell, 4 papillary cell, and 1 clear papillary cell). Oncocytoma (n = 4), adenoma (n = 1), fibroadipose tissue (n = 1), papillary epithelial hyperplasia (n = 1), and chronic pyelonephritis (n = 1) were present. Surgical margins were negative in all patients. During a median follow-up period of 15.5 ± 10.9 (3-46) months, neither local recurrence nor distant metastasis was detected. In conclusion, RAPN is a safe, minimally invasive surgical approach, with excellent surgical and oncological outcomes in T1 kidney tumors. Zero ischemia off-clamp RAPN is also safe in selected masses with the advantage of avoiding complete renal ischemia.","Ener, Kemal; Canda, Abdullah Erdem; Altinova, Serkan; Atmaca, Ali Fuat; Alkan, Erdal; Asil, Erem; Ozcan, Muhammet Fuat; Akbulut, Ziya; Balbay, Mevlana Derya",The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kjms.2015.09.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26853170/,761

Despite the widespread use of metformin, there is considerable variation in treatment response; with approximately one-third of patients failing to achieve adequate glycemic control. Studies have reported the involvement of single nucleotide polymorphisms and their interactions in genetic pathways i.e., pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. This study aims to investigate the association between 19 pharmacogenetics biomarkers and response to metformin treatment. Methods MassARRAY panels were designed and optimized by Inqaba Biotechnical Industries, to genotype 19 biomarkers for 140 type 2 diabetic outpatients. Results The CT genotype of the rs12752688 polymorphism was significantly associated with increased response to metformin therapy after correction (OR=0.33, 95% CI [0.16-0.68], p-value=0.006). An association was also found between the GA genotype of SLC47A2 rs12943590 and a decreased response to metformin therapy after correction (OR=2.29, 95% CI [1.01-5.21], p-value=0.01). Conclusions This is the first study investigating the association between genetic variants and responsiveness to medication for diabetic patients from the indigenous Nguni population in South Africa. It is suggested that rs12752688 and rs12943590 be included in pharmacogenomics profiling systems to individualize metformin therapy for diabetic patients from African populations.","Xhakaza, Lettilia; Abrahams-October, Zainonesa; Pearce, Brendon; Masilela, Charity Mandisa; Adeniyi, Oladele Vincent; Johnson, Rabia; Ongole, Joven Jebio; Benjeddou, Mongi",Drug metabolism and personalized therapy,https://doi.org/10.1515/dmdi-2020-0111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609649/,761

Misinformation dissemination under the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic can be considered a cause of health-related anxieties and severe harm to the countries. The present study aims to explain factors related to the dissemination and acceptance of coronavirus misinformation in Iran. MATERIAL AND METHODS This qualitative study was carried out through content analysis in the year 2020. The population included Iranian experts in Information and Communication Sciences, among whom 19 experts were selected through the purposive sampling method. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed through Continuous Thematic Analysis. Such criteria authenticated data trustworthiness as credibility, confirmability, dependability, and transferability proposed by Guba and Lincoln. FINDINGS Based on the experiences of participants, six major categories and 18 subcategories were identified regarding the major theme. The major categories included the official news and informing system, misinformation nature, users, media, misinformation source, and social determinants. CONCLUSION Concurrent with the Covid-19 outbreak, a sort of information tsunami occurs. Unavoidably, a significant amount of misinformation regarding the various aspects of the virus, such as its origin, transmission methods, control, and treatment, are published. In many cases, the spreading information is not checked and verified in terms of accuracy and authenticity. The spread and acceptance of Covid-19 related misinformation happen under the impact of various factors.

Overall, a total of 14 structurally diverse minor constituents were isolated and identified from the petroleum ether fraction of Nephthea sp. The characterised compounds were screened and compared for their inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) using Autodock Vina and MOE software. Interestingly, most compounds were able to bind effectively to the active site of Mpro, of which nephthoside monoacetate (1); an acylated tetraprenyltoluquinol glycoside, exhibited the highest binding capacity in both software with comparable interaction energies to the ligand N3 and moderately acceptable drug-likeness properties, which drew attention to the relevance of marine-derived metabolites from Nephthea sp., particularly compound (1), to develop potential SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors.","Abdelhafez, Omnia Hesham; Fahim, John Refaat; Mustafa, Muhamad; AboulMagd, Asmaa M; Desoukey, Samar Yehia; Hayallah, Alaa M; Kamel, Mohamed Salah; Abdelmohsen, Usama Ramadan",Natural product research,https://doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2021.1925892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027770/,761
107021,"[Invasive liver abscess syndrome caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, case series].",2020-11-01,"INTRODUCTION Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers are trained to place endotracheal tubes (ETTs) in the prehospital setting when indicated. Endotracheal tube cuffs are traditionally inflated with 10cc of air to provide adequate seal against the tracheal lumen. There is literature suggesting that many ETTs are inflated well beyond the accepted safe pressures of 20-30cmH2O, leading to potential complications including ischemia, necrosis, scarring, and stenosis of the tracheal wall. Currently, EMS providers do not routinely check ETT cuff pressures. It was hypothesized that the average ETT cuff pressure of patients arriving at the study site who were intubated by EMS exceeds the safe pressure range of 20-30cmH2O. OBJECTIVES While ETT cuff inflation is necessary to close the respiratory system, thus preventing air leaks and aspiration, there is evidence to suggest that over-inflated ETT cuffs can cause long-term complications. The purpose of this study is to characterize the cuff pressures of ETTs placed by EMS providers. METHODS This project was a single center, prospective observational study. Endotracheal tube cuff pressures were measured and recorded for adult patients intubated by EMS providers prior to arrival at a large, urban, tertiary care center over a nine-month period. All data were collected by respiratory therapists utilizing a cuff pressure measurement device which had a detectable range of 0-100cmH2O and was designed as a syringe. Results including basic patient demographics, cuff pressure, tube size, and EMS service were recorded. RESULTS In total, 45 measurements from six EMS services were included with ETT sizes ranging from 6.5-8.0mm. Mean patient age was 52.2 years (67.7% male). Mean cuff pressure was 81.8cmH2O with a range of 15 to 100 and a median of 100. The mode was 100cmH2O; 40 out of 45 (88.9%) cuff pressures were above 30cmH2O. Linear regression showed no correlation between age and ETT cuff pressure or between ETT size and cuff pressure. Two-tailed T tests did not show a significant difference in the mean cuff pressure between female versus male patients. CONCLUSION An overwhelming majority of prehospital intubations are associated with elevated cuff pressures, and cuff pressure monitoring education is indicated to address this phenomenon.","Chen, Ruo S; O'Connor, Laurel; Rebesco, Matthew R; LaBarge, Kara L; Remotti, Edgar J; Tennyson, Joseph C",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x21000297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818359/,761

Magnetic fields may potentially interfere with the function of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. In this study, we evaluated the potential magnetic interference of magnetic drapes on pacemaker function. A magnetic drape with 70 magnets was placed with its approximate center over the pacemaker of 50 patients during their visit to the cardiology clinic. In those pacemakers that demonstrated magnetic interference, the drape was pulled caudally in 3-cm increments until the interference ceased. If there was no interference, the drape was folded in 2 over the pacemaker. The number of magnets necessary to maintain magnetic interference with the pacemaker was also tested. Magnetic interference was observed in the pacemakers of 47 (94%) patients: 35 with the unfolded drape and another 12 with the folded drape. Patients whose pacemakers had interference with the unfolded drape weighed less (68 ± 15 kg vs 81 ± 19 kg; P = 0.016) than those who had no interference. In 54% of patients, magnetic interference ceased when the drape was pulled 3 cm caudally and at 15 cm, no pacemaker had magnetic interference. Magnetic drapes may cause magnetic interference with cardiac pacemakers, and this interference ceases at a caudal distance of 15 cm. Magnetic interference seems more likely in patients with lower body weight. Careful monitoring of the pulse and electrocardiogram for asynchronous pacing activity should be considered when magnetic drapes are used in patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices.","Zaphiratos, Valerie; Donati, Francois; Drolet, Pierre; Bianchi, Andrea; Benzaquen, Bruno; Lapointe, Jacques; Fortier, Louis-Philippe",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e31827ab470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23400981/,761

Currently, BP is measured using cuff-based methods, which are obtrusive and not suitable for continuous monitoring. Estimation of BP using pulse transit time (PTT) is a prominent method that eliminates the need for a cuff. In this paper, we present a new method to estimate BP based on PTT measurements from an array of 2×2 bio-impedance sensors placed on the wrist, which can be integrated into a small wearable device such as a smart watch for continuous BP monitoring. Diastolic and systolic BP were estimated using AdaBoost regression model based on PTT features extracted from the wrist bio-impedance signals. Data was collected from three participants using our custom bio-impedance sensors. Our method can estimate BP accurately with correlation coefficient, mean absolute error (MAE) and standard deviation (STD) of 0.92, 1.71 and 2.46 mmHg for the diastolic BP and 0.94, 2.57 and 4.35 mmHg for the systolic BP.","Ibrahim, Bassem; Jafari, Roozbeh",IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference : healthcare technology : [proceedings].

Understanding cavernous internal carotid artery (cICA) tortuosity may help to predict procedural complexities of deploying flow diverters. METHODS Pipeline embolization device (PED) neurointerventions for ICA aneurysms proximal to the ICA termination were reviewed. Cavernous ICA tortuosity was measured as a ratio D/AP, where D=height difference of the anterior and posterior genus, AP=sum of the angles of the anterior (A) and posterior (P) genus. Four types of cICA tortuosity were proposed. An analysis of variance regression and Fisher's exact test were performed to analyze differences among the types. RESULTS Cavernous ICA tortuosity was categorized into minimal (type I, n=28), moderate (type II-III, n=29), and severe (type IV, n=26). The groups were comparable for patient age (mean ± SEM years, type I: 55.6±10.4, II-III: 56.4±14.4, IV: 55±12.8) and aneurysm size (mean±SEM mm, type I: 6.25±3.5, II-III: 7.6±4.9, IV: 9.11±4.9). Analysis of variance demonstrated significant differences in procedural fluoroscopy time (mean ± SEM min, type I: 29.8±8.4, II-III: 44.9±34.1, IV: 52.6±17.2, p<0.005) and mean ± SEM D/AP (type I: 0.008±0.0008, II-III: 0.141±0.07, IV: 0.482±0.365, p<0.0001). Procedural complexity was also statistically significant (p<0.005) with 4%, 28%, and 35% of cases in types I, II-III, and IV, respectively, requiring intraprocedural PED removal or balloon post-processing of the implanted PED. CONCLUSIONS We propose a classification system for cICA tortuosity based on measurements of the anterior and posterior genu geometry. This classification correlates strongly with markers of PED procedural complexity and may be helpful in pre-procedure prognostication.","Lin, Li-Mei; Colby, Geoffrey P; Jiang, Bowen; Uwandu, Chiedozie; Huang, Judy; Tamargo, Rafael J; Coon, Alexander L",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24996435/,761

A note for the debate.,2020-10-20,"Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of primary aldosteronism, the most frequent cause of secondary hypertension, are crucial to prevent deleterious cardiovascular outcomes. In the past decade, the discovery of genetic abnormalities responsible for sporadic and familial forms of primary aldosteronism has improved the knowledge of the pathogenesis of this disorder. Mutations in genes encoding ion channels and pumps lead to increased cytosolic concentrations of calcium in zona glomerulosa cells, which triggers CYP11B2 expression and autonomous aldosterone production. Improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying the disease is key to improving diagnostics and to developing and implementing targeted treatments. This Review provides an update on the genetic abnormalities associated with sporadic and familial forms of primary aldosteronism, their frequency among different populations and the mechanisms explaining excessive aldosterone production and adrenal nodule development. The possible effects and uses of these findings for improving the diagnostics for primary aldosteronism are discussed. Furthermore, current treatment options of primary aldosteronism are reviewed, with particular attention to the latest studies on blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes following medical or surgical treatment.

One potential approach to address myopia and its complications is early detection and treatment. However, current healthcare systems may not be able to cope with the growing burden. Digital technological solutions such as artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as a potential adjunct for myopia management. RECENT FINDINGS There are currently four significant domains of AI in myopia, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), genetics and natural language processing (NLP). ML has been demonstrated to be a useful adjunctive for myopia prediction and biometry for cataract surgery in highly myopic individuals. DL techniques, particularly convoluted neural networks, have been applied to various image-related diagnostic and predictive solutions. Applications of AI in genomics and NLP appear to be at a nascent stage. SUMMARY Current AI research is mainly focused on disease classification and prediction in myopia. Through greater collaborative research, we envision AI will play an increasingly critical role in big data analysis by aggregating a greater variety of parameters including genomics and environmental factors. This may enable the development of generalizable adjunctive DL systems that could help realize predictive and individualized precision medicine for myopic patients.","Foo, Li Lian; Ng, Wei Yan; Lim, Gilbert Yong San; Tan, Tien-En; Ang, Marcus; Ting, Daniel Shu Wei",Current opinion in ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34310401/,761

Following its introduction in Senegal, in 1957, ASF steadily progressed through West Africa, reaching Burkina Faso in 2003, and later Mali in 2016. Despite the heavy burden of disease on pig production, little information is available on the genetic diversity of Africa swine fever virus (ASFV) in Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal. Here, we used real-time PCR ASFV to detect the ASFV genome in samples collected between 1989 and 2016, in Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal, and conventional approaches for isolate characterization. The C-terminal end of the p72 protein gene, the full E183L gene and the central variable region (CVR) within the B602L gene in ASFV genome were sequenced and compared to publicly available sequences. ASFV genome was found in 27 samples, 19 from Burkina Faso, three from Mali and five from Senegal. The phylogenetic analyses showed that all viruses belong to genotype I, with the ASFVs from Burkina Faso and Mali grouping with genotype Ia and ASFV serogroup 4, and those from Senegal with genotype Ib and the ASFV serogroup 1. The analysis of the CVR tetrameric tandem repeat sequences (TRS) showed four TRS variants in Burkina Faso, two in Senegal and one in Mali. The three countries did not share any common TRS, and all CVRs of this study differed from previously reported CVRs in West Africa, except for Senegal. Three of the five isolates from Senegal fully matched with the CVR, p72 and p54 sequences from ASFV IC96 collected during the 1996 ASF outbreak in Ivory Coast. This study shows the spread of the same ASFV strains across countries, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring of ASFV isolates. It also calls for an urgent need to establish a regional plan for the control and eradication of ASF in West Africa.","Minoungou, Germaine L; Diop, Mariame; Dakouo, Marthin; Ouattara, Abdoul Karim; Settypalli, Tirumala Bharani K; Lo, Modou M; Sidibe, Satigui; Kanyala, Estelle; Kone, Yaya Sidi; Diallo, Moctar Sidi; Ouedraogo, Anne; Coulibaly, Kadiatou; Ouedraogo, Victorine; Sow, Ibrahim; Niang, Mamadou; Achenbach, Jenna Elizabeth; Wade, Abel; Unger, Hermann; Diallo, Adama; Cattoli, Giovanni; Lamien, Charles Euloge; Simpore, Jacques",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.14240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323385/,761

In some countries, these surges during the initial outbreak of the disease have resulted in hospitals suffering from significant resource strain, leading to excess patient mortality and negatively impacting staff wellbeing. As experience builds in managing these surges, it has become evident that agile, tailored planning tools are required. The comprehensive hospital agile preparedness (CHAPs) tool provides clinical planners with six key domains to consider that frequently create resource strain during COVID-19; it also allows local planners to identify issues unique to their hospital, system or region. Although this tool has been developed from COVID-19 experiences, it has potential to be modified for a variety of pandemic scenarios according to transmission modes, rates and critical care resource requirements.","Adelaja, Ini; Sayma, Meelad; Walton, Henry; McLachlan, Greta; de Boisanger, James; Bartlett-Pestell, Sam; Roche, Emma; Gandhi, Vanita; Wilson, Gavin J; Brookes, Zara; Yeen Fung, Chee; Macfarlane, Heather; Navaratnam, Annakan; James, Christopher; Scolding, Peter; Sara, Hurley",Future healthcare journal,https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2020-0030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32550286/,761

METHOD All patients who underwent LDP or RDP from 2011 to 2017 and with a minimum postoperative follow-up of 12 months were included in the study. To minimize bias, a propensity score-matched analysis (1:2) was performed. Two different questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D) were completed by the patients. The mean differential cost and mean differential Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) were calculated and plotted on a cost-utility plane. RESULTS The study population consisted of 152 patients. After having applied the propensity score matching, the final population included 103 patients divided into RDP group (n = 37, 36%) and LDP (n = 66, 64%). No differences were found between groups regarding the baseline, intraoperative, postoperative, and pathological variables (p > 0.05). The QoL analysis showed a significant improvement in the RDP group on the postoperative social function, nausea, vomiting, and financial status (p = 0.010, p = 0.050, and p = 0.030, respectively). As expected, the crude costs analysis confirmed that RDP was more expensive than LDP (12,053 Euros vs. 5519 Euros, p < 0.001). However, the robotic approach had a higher probability of being more cost-effective than the laparoscopic procedure when a willingness to pay of more than 4800 Euros/QALY was accepted. CONCLUSION RDP was associated with QoL improvement in specific domains. Crude costs were higher relative to LDP. Cost-effectiveness threshold resulted to be 4800 euros/QALY. The increasing worldwide diffusion of the robotic technology, with easier access and possible cost reduction, could increase the sustainability of this procedure.","De Pastena, Matteo; Esposito, Alessandro; Paiella, Salvatore; Surci, Niccolò; Montagnini, Greta; Marchegiani, Giovanni; Malleo, Giuseppe; Secchettin, Erica; Casetti, Luca; Ricci, Claudio; Landoni, Luca; Bovo, Chiara; Bassi, Claudio; Salvia, Roberto",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07528-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240383/,761

A quality improvement (QI) project that included streamlining the stroke care pathway and simulation-based training was followed by a significant reduction in median door-to-needle time (27 to 13 min) and improved patient outcomes after stroke thrombolysis at our centre. Here, we present a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis of the QI project. METHODS Costs for implementing and sustaining QI were assessed using recognised frameworks for economic evaluations. Effectiveness was calculated from previously published outcome measures. Cost-effectiveness was presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios including costs per minute door-to-needle time reduction per patient, and costs per averted death in the 13-month post-intervention period. We also estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for a projected 5-year post-intervention period and for varying numbers of patients treated with thrombolysis. Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis including and excluding costs of unpaid time. RESULTS All costs including fixed costs for implementing the QI project totalled US$44 802, while monthly costs were US$2141. We calculated a mean reduction in door-to-needle time of 13.1 min per patient and 6.36 annual averted deaths. Across different scenarios, the estimated costs per minute reduction in door-to-needle time per patient ranged from US$13 to US$29, and the estimated costs per averted death ranged from US$4679 to US$10 543. CONCLUSIONS We have shown that a QI project aiming to improve stroke thrombolysis treatment at our centre can be implemented and sustained at a relatively low cost with increasing cost-effectiveness over time. Our work builds on the emerging theory and practice for economic evaluations in QI projects and simulation-based training. The presented cost-effectiveness data might help guide healthcare leaders planning similar interventions.","Ajmi, Soffien Chadli; Kurz, Martin W; Ersdal, Hege; Lindner, Thomas; Goyal, Mayank; Issenberg, S Barry; Vossius, Corinna",BMJ quality & safety,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2021-013398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34599087/,761

Preceded by over a century-long subjugation to the U.S. government, a recent financial crisis, the devastating hurricanes of 2017, and a string of earthquakes at the end of 2019 and early 2020, the current COVID-19 pandemic is only the most recent disaster to disrupt the local health care system in Puerto Rico. However, the effects of the current emergency and imposed social distancing measures have only exacerbated the underlying vulnerabilities of the transgender and gender non-conforming (GNC) population made bare during these other recent disasters. Clinics and providers who treat patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in Puerto Rico have had to develop their own safety protocols to limit the spread of the virus while trying to optimize current treatment protocols to maintain the stability of their patients. Despite these measures, we have observed a reduction in the ability of local organizations to outreach to already disconnected transgender and GNC individuals with OUD. For example, due to the government-imposed curfew that began March 15, 2020, some providers engaged in outreach with transgender and GNC sex workers have eliminated nighttime outreach completely. Additionally, a research project surveying all buprenorphine prescribers in Puerto Rico has found that few have received training in treating this vulnerable population, and even fewer report that they are currently providing treatment for transgender or GNC individuals. If Puerto Rico is to address this problem of gross under-representation of a population known to be disproportionately affected by substance use disorders, Puerto Rico must address structural factors to prevent this disparity from widening further during the inevitable future disasters our health care system will face.","Melin, Kyle; Santiago Quiñones, Darlene; Rodríguez-Díaz, Carlos E",Journal of substance abuse treatment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33279333/,761

It is male predominant and for reasons that are unknown also associated with significantly worse outcomes in men2. Here we compared gene co-expression networks in affected and unaffected pulmonary tissue derived from 126 patients with Stage IA-IV lung cancer. We observed marked degradation of a sex-associated gene co-expression network in tumour tissue. The disturbance was linked to fractional loss of the Y chromosome and was detected in 28% of male tumours in the discovery dataset and 27% of male tumours in a 123 sample replication dataset. Depression of Y chromosome expression was accompanied by extensive autosomal DNA hypomethylation. The male specific H3K4 demethylase, KDM5D, was identified as an apex hub within this co-expression network. Male patients exhibiting relative tumour KDM5D deficiency had an increased risk of death in the discovery dataset (Hazard Ratio [HR] 3.80, 95% CI 1.40 - 10.3, P=0.009) and in an independent sample of 1,100 male lung tumours (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.4-2.0, P=1.2x10-10).

However, such data are lacking for both asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients. We share our single center experience on duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral presence in the upper respiratory tract of cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (asymptomatic and symptomatic) detected by viral PCR. Methods: This is retrospective review of cancer patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and measurement of viral shedding at Levine Cancer Institute. Testing indications were COVID-19 symptomatic illness, pre-procedural and pre-chemo testing. Prolonged shedding was defined as presence of viral RNA beyond 30 days after first positive test. To document viral clearance, patients required 2 negative SARSCoV-2 PCR test separated by at least 24 hours and maximum 3 weeks apart either by nasopharyngeal or nasal PCR swab. Differences in distributions were identified between patients shedding virus more than 30 days and less than 30 days using uni- and multivariable logistic regression models. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.10 to enter the multivariable model, and p &lt; 0.05 to remain. Results: Demographic data: median age 62 (range 20-93);58.5% females;70% White, 21% Black, and 7.4% Hispanics. Comorbidities included hypertension 43.2%, diabetes 16.7% and chronic lung disease 3.7%. Underlying malignancies were breast cancer 25%, hematologic cancer 22%, lung cancer 16% and genitourinary 11%. Chemotherapy was received by 26.5% patients within 4 weeks prior to testing. 162 patients were identified median duration of 18 days (range 4-90 days). Of these, 76% patients were tested for non-symptomatic indication with median duration of shedding 17 days (range 6-80) and 23% were tested for clinical symptoms with median duration of shedding 29 days (range 4-90) (p = &lt; 0.001);50% of patients never developed symptoms, whereas 35% patients with non-symptomatic testing indication, subsequently developed symptoms. Viral clearance by day 30, day 45, day 60 and day 90 was 78%, 93%, 97% and 100% respectively. Univariate analysis did not show difference between patients with prolonged shedding vs those shedding less than 30 days for age, gender, race, ethnicity, underlying malignancy, co-morbidities including body mass index, diabetes, chronic lung conditions, hypertension, or receipt of cytotoxic chemo. Multivariable analysis showed that presence of symptoms at any point during SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 5.9, 95% CI 2.4-14.5, p &lt; 0.001) was associated with prolonged shedding. Conclusions: Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with prolonged viral shedding in cancer patients. Cancer patients can have asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Using different approaches we have demonstrated that the spike (S) protein and the membrane (M) protein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) associate to form large complexes. Newly synthesized M was found in these complexes almost immediately after its synthesis, whereas the S protein started to appear in heterocomplexes after 10-20 min. This is consistent with the slow rate of folding of S and with the observation that folding of S preceeds its association with M. While the folding of S involves the formation of multiple disulfide bonds, folding of M is disulfide-independent. This contrast was reflected by the differential sensitivity of the two proteins to reduction with dithiothreitol (DTT). Addition of DTT to the culture medium of MHV-infected cells drastically impaired the folding of S, but not of M. Consequently, the S protein was unable to interact with M. Under these conditions, S stayed in the ER while M was transported efficiently beyond the site of budding to the Golgi complex. We conclude that the association of S with M is an essential step in the formation of the viral envelope and in the accumulation of both proteins at the site of virus assembly.","Opstelten, D J; de Groote, P; Horzinek, M C; Rottier, P J",Archives of virology.

RECENT FINDINGS In the acute-care setting, critical illness polyneuropathy and critical illness myopathy are important causes of acute paralysis in critically ill comatose patients, and may cause inappropriately pessimistic prognoses. Duration of weaning from artificial ventilation is 2 to 7 times greater in patients with critical illness polyneuropathy than in patients without critical illness polyneuropathy. After intensive care unit and hospital discharge, many patients diagnosed with critical illness polyneuropathy or critical illness myopathy are reported to complain of profound muscle weakness. Chronic disability was a common finding among them. Complete functional recovery with patients regaining the ability to breathe spontaneously and to walk independently was reported in 180 of 263 patients (68.4%); severe disability with tetraparesis, tetraplegia, or paraplegia was reported in 74 patients (28.1%). Persisting milder disabilities were common even in patients with complete functional recovery, and included reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes, stocking and glove sensory loss, muscle atrophy, painful hyperesthesia, and foot drop. An association of critical illness polyneuropathy and critical illness myopathy with increased intensive care unit and hospital mortality has been demonstrated only in selected intensive care unit populations; data are insufficient to demonstrate any association with long-term mortality. SUMMARY Intensive care unit-acquired critical illness polyneuropathy and critical illness myopathy influence the evaluation of acutely ill comatose patients and may instigate unreasonably pessimistic prognosis. Critical illness polyneuropathy and critical illness myopathy are an important cause of difficult weaning of patients from the ventilator and of persisting muscle weakness and disability after intensive care unit discharge.","Latronico, Nicola; Shehu, Indrit; Seghelini, Elisa",Current opinion in critical care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16015120/,761

In September 2007, a cluster of seven additional infections with PFGE pattern 1 was identified in North Dakota; all seven patients had been exposed to baby chicks obtained from hatchery A. A subsequent nationwide investigation identified a total of 65 S. Montevideo isolates with PFGE pattern 1 during 2007 and a likely association with exposure to live poultry purchased at feed stores or by mail order from hatchery A or seven other hatcheries in four states. Meanwhile, throughout 2007, a separate outbreak was occurring that involved infections with a different S. Montevideo strain (PFGE pattern 2). A total of 64 of those isolates were identified in 23 states during 2007. Exposure to live poultry from a hatchery in New Mexico (hatchery B) and a hatchery in Ohio (hatchery C) was associated with those infections. This report describes two distinct and unrelated outbreaks, which demonstrate the ongoing risk for Salmonella infection from live poultry purchased from agricultural feed stores or directly from mail order hatcheries. The mail order hatchery industry is a source of bird-associated human pathogens, such as Salmonella, and comprehensive infection-control strategies are needed to prevent additional illnesses resulting from live poultry contact.",,MMWR.

When administered systemically, however, their role in liver tropism is limited because CAR-permissive and mutated viruses show similar biodistribution, a finding recently attributed to blood coagulation factor (F) IX or complement protein C4BP binding to the adenovirus fiber and ""bridging"" to either low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein or heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Here, we show that hepatocyte transduction in vitro can be enhanced by the vitamin K-dependent factors FX, protein C, and FVII in addition to FIX but not by prothrombin (FII), FXI, and FXII. This phenomenon was not dependent on proteolytic activation or cell signaling activity and for FX was mediated by direct virus-factor binding. Human FX substantially enhanced hepatocyte transduction by CAR-permissive and mutated viruses in an ex vivo liver perfusion model. In vivo, global down-regulation of vitamin K-dependent zymogens by warfarin significantly diminished liver uptake of CAR-deleted Ads; however, this phenomenon was fully rescued by acute infusion of human FX. Our results indicate a common and pivotal role for distinct vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors in mediating hepatocyte transduction by adenoviruses in vitro and in vivo.","Parker, Alan L; Waddington, Simon N; Nicol, Campbell G; Shayakhmetov, Dmitry M; Buckley, Suzanne M; Denby, Laura; Kemball-Cook, Geoffrey; Ni, Shaoheng; Lieber, Andre; McVey, John H; Nicklin, Stuart A; Baker, Andrew H",Blood,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16788098/,761

This has raised many questions, with an important one being whether the widely disseminated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is transmissible to other animal species. SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted person to person. K9-to-human transmission, although theoretically possible via fomites, is considered minimal, if at all, and there have been no reported cases of K9-to-human transmission. Human-to-K9 transmission, although rare, seems more likely; however, in only one case has a K9 been suspected to have displayed symptoms of COVID-19. Preparation, decontamination, hand hygiene, and distancing remain the key factors in reducing transmission of the virus.

Sixty three patients suspected of COVID-19 infection, were admitted to our hospital during March 2020. Twenty six of these subjects were diagnosed positive by the RT-PCR for SARS Cov-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. We recorded data about epidemiological characteristics, clinical signs and symptoms, in addition to comorbidities, laboratory and radiological studies were done. The median age was 40 years (SD ± 15 years); there was an equal number of men and women; all the patients but one were coming from abroad; the most common symptom was fever (24/26 cases) and lymphopenia (n = 8). We found that there were patients in whom fever disappeared within the first 72h (n = 17) and another group in which the fever lasted six or more days (n = 7). One patient out of 26 died. The population of our study was young and almost all were imported cases, in alinement with the stage of the epidemic at the time when the study was conducted.

194202,[Response of the Catalonia neonatal screening laboratory to the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.],2020-12-16,"The molecular mechanisms involved in the hepatic tropism of hepatitis C virus (HCV) have not been identified. We have shown previously that liver-expressed C-type lectins L-SIGN and DC-SIGN bind the HCV E2 glycoprotein with high affinity (Lozach, P. Y., Lortat-Jacob, H., de Lacroix de Lavalette, A., Staropoli, I., Foung, S., Amara, A., Houles, C., Fieschi, F., Schwartz, O., Virelizier, J. L., Arenzana-Seisdedos, F., and Altmeyer, R. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 20358-20366). To analyze the functional relevance of this interaction, we generated pseudotyped lentivirus particles presenting HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2 at the virion surface (HCV-pp). High mannose N-glycans are present on E1 and, to a lesser extent, on E2 proteins of mature infectious HCV-pp. Such particles bind to both L-SIGN and DC-SIGN, but they cannot use these receptors for entry into cells. However, infectious virus is transmitted efficiently when permissive Huh-7 cells are cocultured with HCV-pp bound to L-SIGN or to DC-SIGN-positive cell lines. HCV-pp transmission via L-SIGN or DC-SIGN is inhibited by characteristic inhibitors such as the calcium chelator EGTA and monoclonal antibodies directed against lectin carbohydrate recognition domains of both lectins. In support of the biological relevance of this phenomenon, dendritic cells expressing endogenous DC-SIGN transmitted HCV-pp with high efficiency in a DC-SIGN-dependent manner. Our results support the hypothesis that C-type lectins such as the liver sinusoidal endothelial cell-expressed L-SIGN could act as a capture receptor for HCV in the liver and transmit infectious virions to neighboring hepatocytes.","Lozach, Pierre-Yves; Amara, Ali; Bartosch, Birke; Virelizier, Jean-Louis; Arenzana-Seisdedos, Fernando; Cosset, François-Loïc; Altmeyer, Ralf",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15166245/,761

First cases of SARS, induced by a new strain of coronavirus, were described in China in 2002 and by May 2003 8360 cases and 764 deaths were reported by the World Health Organization. The disease can be transmitted from person to person and at the onset is characterized by nonspecific symptoms such as a fever of > 38 degrees C, dry cough, myalgia, and dyspnea. Adults can develop severe hypoxemia requiring intubation, whereas the course of the disease is generally benign in children. Avian influenza A H5N1 is another emerging infectious disease transmitted from avian species to humans, without clear evidence of transmission from human to human. The widespread outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in 2003-2004 have caused major problems for the poultry industry in many Asian countries. On January 2004 the disease crossed over to humans, for the first time in Vietnam, causing 74 deaths to date (mortality rate of 50%) in southeastern countries. Unlike SARS, the avian flu occurs in rural areas, where people live in intimate contact with birds, and many of the victims are children < 5 years of age. As for SARS, the World Health Organization has adopted a global action plan to control avian influenza among chickens and ducks and at the same time to limit the threat of a human flu pandemic.","Spicuzza, Lucia; Spicuzza, Alessandro; La Rosa, Mario; Polosa, Riccardo; Di Maria, Giuseppe",Allergy and asthma proceedings,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17390754/,761

As the world's population grows to more than 6 billion, it might seem ridiculous to suggest that any real threat exists to the human species. Diseases have long ravaged populations, as have wars, poverty, and malnutrition. Life today is no different with new and emerging diseases such as SARS and Mad Cow Disease leaving a trail of concern around the planet. All that being said, the AIDS crisis is threatening humans like no other. In countries such as Botswana, close to half the population of pregnant women is infected. Of great concern, the disease is now prevalent among women and teenage girls, threatening not only their lives but those of their offspring. Efforts to control this spread are quite abysmal, albeit well intentioned. Likewise, the death of a child every 15 seconds from diarrheal disease is not being addressed with the same vigor as SARS, even though the risk of dying from the latter for most people is similar to being struck by lightning. In the end, it is the economy and politics that dictate health spending. Image and perception are everything. While deaths mount among women and children from AIDS and other infections, the potential to intervene with a low-risk natural concept of probiotics seemed all too distant. As evidence mounts of the attributes of certain probiotic strains to treat diarrhea and reduce the risk of urogenital and other diseases, the developing world has failed to embrace it, support its evaluation and implementation, and take it to where it is needed the most. In this review, the case for and against probiotics for urogenital and intestinal infections is presented based on current literature. The story is far from complete, but the potential for improving the health of the mother and child is significant. United Nations and World Health Organization guidelines have now been developed to vanquish the unproved marketing hype products that have given probiotics a bad name. It is now up to science to deliver the remedies, and to society to make sure that only proven products reach the marketplace and the people in most need.","Reid, Gregor; Devillard, Estelle",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15220669/,761

This involves nontechnical skills including decision making, task allocation, team working and situation awareness, all of which are underpinned by communication, cooperation and coordination. The use of integrated simulators to create realistic patient scenarios with structured debriefing is an excellent method for teaching in these domains. There has been a huge increase in the delivery of training and education using an expanding variety of clinical simulators. SUMMARY This review summarises the evidence and opinion about how simulation tools can be optimally used. In addition, we propose an educational strategy to optimise the impact on clinical practice by embedding simulation training in a multidisciplinary teaching programme based upon a specifically developed curriculum focusing on the teaching of crisis resource management and patient safety.","Fox-Robichaud, Alison E; Nimmo, Graham R",Current opinion in critical care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17975400/,761

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among informal caregivers during the COVID-19 epidemic in Serbia. Physical and mental quality of life was measured by the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Additional data included sociodemographic characteristics, caregiver and care recipient characteristics, and COVID-19 related concerns. The qualitative component was performed using focus groups and individual in-depth interviews. Results: Out of 112 informal caregivers enrolled, most were female (80%), and the average age was 51.1 ± 12.3 years. The majority was delivering care to one person, who was a family member, on a daily basis (86.4%, 92%, and 91.1%, respectively). In multiple regression models, significant predictors of caregivers' physical health were delivering care to a family member and a higher level of care complexity, while significant predictors of caregivers' mental health were a higher level of care complexity and increased concerns about self-health and the health of the person being cared for due to the COVID-19 epidemic.

Methods: this was a 4-month (12th March to 12th July 2020) cross sectional study carried out in the intensive care unit of the COVID treatment center of Donka National Hospital, the only hospital with a COVID intensive care unit in Guinea. Results: during our period of study 140 patients were hospitalized in the COVID intensive care unit and 35 patients died (25%). In univariate analysis, the occurrence of death was associated with: confusional syndrome (p<0.001), time to admission (p<0.001), use of an inotropic or vasopressor (p<0.001), Brescia score &#8805; 2 (p=0.004), non-invasive ventilation (p=0.011), stroke (p=0.014), Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (p=0.015), male (p=0.021), provenance (p=0.021), acute renal failure (p=0.022), pulmonary embolism (p=0.022), invasive ventilation (p=0.022), and age > 60 years (p=0.047). In multivariate analysis, the factors predictive of mortality were: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (OR= 6.33, 95% CI [1.66-29]; p=0.007), a Brescia score &#8805; 2 (OR =5.8, 95% CI [1.7-19.2]; p=0.004) and admission delay (OR =5.6, 95% CI [1.8-17.5]; p=0.003). Conclusion: our study shows that the acute respiratory distress syndrome, then the Brescia score &#8805; 2, and finally the time to admission to intensive care were all associated with an increased risk of death for patients. These results are different from those reported in Asia, Europe and North America.","Donamou, Joseph; Touré, Abdoulaye; Camara, Amadou Yalla; Camara, Djiki; Camara, M039; Lamine, mah; Traoré, Abdourhamane Dine; Camara, Mariame Mohamed; Bangoura, Almamy; Dramé, Boubacar Atigou; Sossa, Luc Kouessi; Abékan, Jean-Marc Roméo; Edemessi, Axel Irvin; Saliou, Sow Mamadou",Pan Afr Med J,,761

Law and Medical Protocols,2020,"Although the African continent is, for the moment, less impacted than the rest of the world, it still faces the risk of a spread of COVID-19. In this study, we have conducted a systematic review of the information available in the literature in order to provide an overview of the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 pandemic in West Africa and of the impact of risk factors such as comorbidities, climatic conditions and demography on the pandemic. Burkina Faso is used as a case study to better describe the situation in West Africa. The epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in West Africa is marked by a continuous increase in the numbers of confirmed cases. This geographic area had on 29 July 2020, 131 049 confirmed cases by polymerase chain reaction, 88 305 recoveries and 2102 deaths. Several factors may influence the SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Africa: (i) comorbidities: diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure could lead to an increase in the number of severe cases of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) climatic factors: the high temperatures could be a factor contributing to slow the spread of the virus and (iii) demography: the West Africa population is very young and this could be a factor limiting the occurrence of severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in West Africa is relatively slow compared to European countries, vigilance must remain. Difficulties in access to diagnostic tests, lack of hospital equipment, but also the large number of people working in the informal sector (such as trading, businesses, transport and restoration) makes it difficult to apply preventive measures, namely physical distancing and containment.","Tinto, B; Salinas, S; Dicko, A; Kagone, T S; Traore, I; de Rekeneire, N; Bicaba, B W; Hien, H; Meda, N; van de Perre, P; Kania, D; Simonin, Y",Epidemiol Infect,,761

293389,Maybe there is an alternative after all?,2020,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised concerns about altered sensitivity to antibody-mediated immunity. The relative resistance of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to antibody neutralization has been recently investigated. We report that another emergent variant from Brazil, P.1, is not only refractory to multiple neutralizing monoclonal antibodies but also more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma and vaccinee sera. The magnitude of resistance is greater for monoclonal antibodies than vaccinee sera and evident with both pseudovirus and authentic P.1 virus. The cryoelectron microscopy structure of a soluble prefusion-stabilized spike reveals that the P.1 trimer adopts exclusively a conformation in which one of the receptor-binding domains is in the ""up"" position, which is known to facilitate binding to entry receptor ACE2. The functional impact of P.1 mutations thus appears to arise from local changes instead of global conformational alterations. The P.1 variant threatens current antibody therapies but less so protective vaccine efficacy.","Wang, Pengfei; Casner, Ryan G; Nair, Manoj S; Wang, Maple; Yu, Jian; Cerutti, Gabriele; Liu, Lihong; Kwong, Peter D; Huang, Yaoxing; Shapiro, Lawrence; Ho, David D",Cell Host Microbe,,761

We hypothesized that combining drugs with independent mechanisms of action could result in synergy against SARS-CoV-2, thus generating better antiviral efficacy. Using in silico approaches, we prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and then tested them in vitro. Sixteen synergistic and eight antagonistic combinations were identified; among 16 synergistic cases, combinations of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug nitazoxanide with remdesivir, amodiaquine, or umifenovir were most notable, all exhibiting significant synergy against SARS-CoV-2 in a cell model. However, the combination of remdesivir and lysosomotropic drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, demonstrated strong antagonism. Overall, these results highlight the utility of drug repurposing and preclinical testing of drug combinations for discovering potential therapies to treat COVID-19.","Bobrowski, Tesia; Chen, Lu; Eastman, Richard T; Itkin, Zina; Shinn, Paul; Chen, Catherine Z; Guo, Hui; Zheng, Wei; Michael, Sam; Simeonov, Anton; Hall, Matthew D; Zakharov, Alexey V; Muratov, Eugene N",Mol Ther,,761

We explored the use of a remote patient monitoring (RPM) program to care for such outpatients. METHODS: Consecutive patients who were tested for COVID-19 because of symptom onset but were clinically stable were offered enrollment into a pilot RPM program. Patients were provided equipment for vital sign measurements and a computer tablet to enter results three times per day. The results were monitored centrally by clinical staff. The goal was to closely monitor patients and escalate care as warranted. RESULTS: Between March and June of 2020, 29 patients were approached and 26 were enrolled. The mean age was 57 years old (range, 30-88), 14 were women, and patients remained in the program for an average of 16 days (range, 2-63). Twenty-four patients (83%) were on active anticancer therapy. During that time period, only one patient was admitted to the hospital for worsening respiratory symptoms. The percentage of days during which at least one set of data and all three sets of data were entered was 97.2% and 65.7%, respectively. There was no association between the demographic factors of age, sex, or the reason for being monitored with the level of engagement (P > .05). CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, patients with cancer were readily enrolled in a remote home monitoring program. Monitoring was feasible, and there was a high rate of engagement with the program. The role of RPM should be further tested as the COVID pandemic continues.","Steimer, Mary; Leabo, Jessica; Wang, Hongkun; Heyer, David; Addison, Nancy; Bowles, Nancy; Cannon, Timothy L; Cuevo, Raymund; Ershler, William B; Shafer, Danielle; Jang, Sekwon; Pennisi, Angela; Al-Hussain, Amjaad; Farrell, Kirby; Deeken, John F",JCO Oncol Pract,,761

328684,Native food systems impacted by COVID,2020,"Dysfunctional megakaryopoiesis hampers platelet production, which is closely associated with thrombocytopenia (PT). Macrophages (MÐ¤s) are crucial cellular components in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. However, the specific effects of M1 MÐ¤s or M2 MÐ¤s on regulating megakaryocytes (MKs) are largely unknown. In the current study, aberrant BM-M1/M2 MÐ¤ polarization, characterized by increased M1 MÐ¤s and decreased M2 MÐ¤s and accompanied by impaired megakaryopoiesis-supporting abilities, was found in patients with PT post-allotransplant. RNA-seq and western blot analysis showed that the PI3K-AKT pathway was downregulated in the BM MÐ¤s of PT patients. Moreover, in vitro treatment with PI3K-AKT activators restored the impaired megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability of MÐ¤s from PT patients. Furthermore, we found M1 MÐ¤s suppress, whereas M2 MÐ¤s support MK maturation and platelet formation in humans. Chemical inhibition of PI3K-AKT pathway reduced megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability of M2 MÐ¤s, as indicated by decreased MK count, colony-forming unit number, high-ploidy distribution, and platelet count. Importantly, genetic knockdown of the PI3K-AKT pathway impaired the megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability of MÐ¤s both in vitro and in a MÐ¤-specific PI3K-knockdown murine model, indicating a critical role of PI3K-AKT pathway in regulating the megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability of M2 MÐ¤s. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicated that TGF-ß released by M2 MÐ¤s may facilitate megakaryopoiesis through upregulation of the JAK2/STAT5 and MAPK/ERK pathways in MKs. Taken together, our data reveal that M1 and M2 MÐ¤s have opposing effects on MKs in a PI3K-AKT pathway-dependent manner, which may lead to new insights into the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia and provide a potential therapeutic strategy to promote megakaryopoiesis.","Zhao, Hong-Yan; Zhang, Yuan-Yuan; Xing, Tong; Tang, Shu-Qian; Wen, Qi; Lyu, Zhong-Shi; Lv, Meng; Wang, Yu; Xu, Lan-Ping; Zhang, Xiao-Hui; Kong, Yuan; Huang, Xiao-Jun",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,761
329554,An ethical Response in the Care of Nursing Homes in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread uncontrollably worldwide while it remains unknown how vulnerable populations, such as Down syndrome (DS) individuals are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with DS have more risk of infections with respiratory complications and present signs of auto-inflammation. They also present with multiple comorbidities that are associated with poorer COVID-19 prognosis in the general population. All this might place DS individuals at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or poorer clinical outcomes. In order to get insight into the interplay between DS genes and SARS-cov2 infection and pathogenesis we identified the genes associated with the molecular pathways involved in COVID-19 and the host proteins interacting with viral proteins from SARS-CoV-2. We then analyzed the overlaps of these genes with HSA21 genes, HSA21 interactors and other genes consistently differentially expressed in DS (using public transcriptomic datasets) and created a DS-SARS-CoV-2 network. We detected COVID-19 protective and risk factors among HSA21 genes and interactors and/or DS deregulated genes that might affect the susceptibility of individuals with DS both at the infection stage and in the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Our analysis suggests that at the infection stage DS individuals might be more susceptible to infection due to triplication of TMPRSS2, that primes the viral S protein for entry in the host cells. However, as the anti-viral interferon I signaling is also upregulated in DS, this might increase the initial anti-viral response, inhibiting viral genome release, viral replication and viral assembly. In the second pro-inflammatory immunopathogenic phase of the infection, the prognosis for DS patients might worsen due to upregulation of inflammatory genes that might favor the typical cytokine storm of COVID-19. We also detected strong downregulation of the NLRP3 gene, critical for maintenance of homeostasis against pathogenic infections, possibly leading to bacterial infection complications.","De Toma, Ilario; Dierssen, Mara",Sci Rep,,761

We undertook a systematic literature review of the articles indexed in PubMed on olfactory disorders in viral respiratory tract conditions, with special emphasis on COVID-19. The main objective was to find evidence of clinical interest to support the relationship between anosmia and COVID-19. Olfactory disorders in upper respiratory tract infections are frequent, most caused by obstruction due to oedema of the nasal mucosa. Occasionally, post-viral sensorineural olfactory dysfunction occurs, with a variable prognosis. The evidence on anosmia in COVID-19 patients is extremely limited, corresponding to a level 5 or D of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. According to the available evidence, it seems reasonable to apply isolation, hygiene and social distancing measures in patients with recent olfactory disorders as the only symptom, although the usefulness of diagnostic tests for this type of patient should be studied.","Lop Gros, Joan; Iglesias Coma, Mar; González Farré, Mónica; Serra Pujadas, Consol",Acta otorrinolaringol. esp,,761

There are several criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma to be eligible for liver transplantation, and it depends on main transplantation centers worldwide. Locoregional treatments and downstaging protocols are used for either to achieve these criteria or to prevent drop outs on the transplant waiting lists. But who can benefit from these bridging therapies effectively for the main purpose of curative treatment? Main contraindications are known for locoregional treatments like cirrhosis or low hepatic function, total main portal vein occlusion, and extrahepatic metastasis. HCCs, which are confined to liver but have high tumor burden, remains the main controversial issue. AIM: On this aspect, we reviewed the literature for downstaging protocols for hepatocellular carcinoma with their effect on survival and recurrence rates after liver transplantation. CONCLUSION: Although candidates for downstaging is still controversial, with the absence of main contraindications, LRT can be applied to selected HCCs, which have a certain degree of tumor burden.","Dirican, Abuzer; Karakas, Serdar",,,761

During the pandemic, affordable healthcare was widely available in Japan and the medical system did not suffer a collapse, making accurate comparisons between prefectures possible. For the 16 prefectures included in this study that had daily maximum confirmed cases exceeding ten, the number of daily confirmed cases follow bell-shape or log-normal distribution in most prefectures. A good correlation was observed between the spread and decay durations. However, some exceptions were observed in areas where travelers returned from foreign countries, which were defined as the origins of infection clusters. Excluding these prefectures, the population density was shown to be a major factor, affecting the spread and decay patterns, with R2 = 0.39 (p < 0.05) and 0.42 (p < 0.05), respectively, approximately corresponding to social distancing. The maximum absolute humidity was found to affect the decay duration normalized by the population density (R2 > 0.36, p < 0.05). Our findings indicate that the estimated pandemic spread duration, based on the multivariate analysis of maximum absolute humidity, ambient temperature, and population density (adjusted R2 = 0.53, p-value < 0.05), could prove useful for intervention planning during potential future pandemics, including a second COVID-19 outbreak.","Rashed, Essam A; Kodera, Sachiko; Gomez-Tames, Jose; Hirata, Akimasa",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,761

Specifically, Statistical Neural Networks ( Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN)), and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are applied to develop the COVID-19 Mortality Rate Prediction (MRP) model for India. For that purpose, there are two types of dataset used in this study: One is COVID-19 Death cases, a Time Series Data and the other is COVID-19 Confirmed Case and Death Cases where Death case is dependent variable and the Confirmed case is an independent variable. Hyperparameter optimization or tuning is used in these regression models, which is the process of identifying a set of optimal hyperparameters for any learning process with minimal error. Here, sigma (σ) is a hyperparameter whose value is used to constrain the learning process of the above models with minimum Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The performance of the models is evaluated using the RMSE and 'R2 values, which shows that the GRP model performs better than the GRNN and RBFNN. © 2021 Dhamodharavadhani S et al.","Dhamodharavadhani, S.; Rathipriya, R.",African Health Sciences,,761

An Assessment of Resources Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of lockdown during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic on daily all-cause admissions, and by age and diagnosis subgroups, and the odds of all-cause mortality in a hospital in rural KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). DESIGN: Observational cohort. SETTING: Referral hospital for 17 primary care clinics in uMkhanyakude District. PARTICIPANTS: Data collected by the Africa Health Research Institute on all admissions from 1 January to 20 October: 5848 patients contributed to 6173 admissions. EXPOSURE: Five levels of national lockdown in South Africa from 27 March 2020, with restrictions decreasing from levels 5 to 1, respectively. OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes and trends in daily all-cause admissions and risk of in-hospital mortality before and at each stage of lockdown, estimated by Poisson and logistic interrupted time series regression, with stratification for age, sex and diagnosis. RESULTS: Daily admissions decreased during level 5 lockdown for infants (incidence rate ratio (IRR) compared with prelockdown 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.90), children aged 1-5 years old (IRR 0.43, 95% CI 028 to 0.65) and respiratory diagnoses (IRR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.90). From level 4 to level 3, total admissions increased (IRR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.28), as well as for men >19 years (IRR 1.50, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.92) and respiratory diagnoses (IRR 4.26, 95% CI 2.36 to 7.70). Among patients admitted to hospital, the odds of death decreased during level 5 compared with prelockdown (adjusted OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.83) and then increased in later stages. CONCLUSIONS: Level 5 lockdown is likely to have prevented the most vulnerable population, children under 5 years and those more severely ill from accessing hospital care in rural KZN, as reflected by the drop in admissions and odds of mortality. Subsequent increases in admissions and in odds of death in the hospital could be due to improved and delayed access to hospital as restrictions were eased.","McIntosh, Amy; Bachmann, Max; Siedner, Mark J; Gareta, Dickman; Seeley, Janet; Herbst, Kobus",BMJ Open,,761

Thus, 600 MHz (1)H solvent-suppressed single-pulse, spin-echo, and 2D J-resolved spectra were collected on plasma recorded from SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR-positive patients (n = 15, with multiple sampling timepoints) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 34, confirmed rRT-PCR negative), together with patients with COVID-19/influenza-like clinical symptoms who tested SARS-CoV-2 negative (n = 35). We compared the single-pulse NMR spectral data with in vitro diagnostic research (IVDr) information on quantitative lipoprotein profiles (112 parameters) extracted from the raw 1D NMR data. All NMR methods gave highly significant discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from controls and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with individual NMR methods, giving different diagnostic information windows on disease-induced phenoconversion. Longitudinal trajectory analysis in selected patients indicated that metabolic recovery was incomplete in individuals without detectable virus in the recovery phase. We observed four plasma cytokine clusters that expressed complex differential statistical relationships with multiple lipoproteins and metabolites. These included the following: cluster 1, comprising MIP-1β, SDF-1α, IL-22, and IL-1α, which correlated with multiple increased LDL and VLDL subfractions; cluster 2, including IL-10 and IL-17A, which was only weakly linked to the lipoprotein profile; cluster 3, which included IL-8 and MCP-1 and were inversely correlated with multiple lipoproteins. IL-18, IL-6, and IFN-γ together with IP-10 and RANTES exhibited strong positive correlations with LDL1–4 subfractions and negative correlations with multiple HDL subfractions. Collectively, these data show a distinct pattern indicative of a multilevel cellular immune response to SARS CoV-2 infection interacting with the plasma lipoproteome giving a strong and characteristic immunometabolic phenotype of the disease. We observed that some patients in the respiratory recovery phase and testing virus-free were still metabolically highly abnormal, which indicates a new role for these technologies in assessing full systemic recovery.","Lodge, Samantha; Nitschke, Philipp; Kimhofer, Torben; Coudert, Jerome D.; Begum, Sofina; Bong, Sze-How; Richards, Toby; Edgar, Dale; Raby, Edward; Spraul, Manfred; Schaefer, Hartmut; Lindon, John C.; Loo, Ruey Leng; Holmes, Elaine; Nicholson, Jeremy K.",J Proteome Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33426894/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00876,761

Our paper aims to compare the clinical sensitivity of different commercial RT-qPCR (Genesig, 1copy, DNA-Techonolgy and Charité primer-probe sets), isothermal PCR (Ustar Isothermal Amplification-Real Time Fluorescent Assay) and immunochromatographic antigen detection (BOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag) assays developed to use in laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. A total of 119 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from symptomatic patients. A subset of samples, positive with two RT-qPCR assays were then tested with isothermal PCR and rapid antigen tests. Of the 119 specimens, 65 were positive by at least two PCR assays. All PCR assays showed substantial or perfect match, although some variations in the clinical performance was observed. Of the 37 and 32 remnant nasopharyngeal samples positive by RT-qPCR, respectively, three were positive by the BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag and 14 were detected by the isothermal amplification assay. In conclusion, in the clinical settings we recorded that each of the RT-qPCR assays was superior to other test formats, in particular, the routine use of the DNA-technology assay is recommended. Although alternative recommendations exist, we belive that the use of isothermal amplifiaction assays and antigen rapid tests for COVID-19 diagnosis can only serve as adjuncts while awaiting the PCR result because of their high false-negative rate.","Kenyeres, Bence; Ánosi, Noel; Bányai, Krisztián; Mátyus, Mária; Orosz, László; Kiss, Andrea; Kele, Beatrix; Burián, Katalin; Lengyel, György",J Virol Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.114165; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609342100104X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609342100104X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872650/,761

RESULTS: There were a total of 316 emergency referrals across the three time periods. The number of referrals fell by 15% between the pre-COVID-19 period and the first wave. Comparing the first and second waves, the number of referrals was increased by 58%. Comparing the second wave to the pre-COVID-19 period, referrals were 34% greater in the second wave (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: We highlight an increase in referrals to our spinal service during the secondary wave, having fallen during the first wave. We hypothesise that the increase in referrals, despite similar restrictions to the first wave, is a result of changing patterns of behaviour due to the fear of contracting COVID during the first wave and difficulty in accessing primary care services in the second wave.","Naskar, Rajib; Baryeh, Kwaku W; Pavuluri, Sindhu; Rajagopal, Trichy",Musculoskeletal Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34516029/; https://doi.org/10.1002/msc.1589,761
616510,Maybe there is an alternative after all?,2020-05-23,"Objective The impact of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) conditions is not clearly understood. To explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and survival in this patient group, we conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Design We interrogated linked electronic health records for patients diagnosed with HPB diseases in East London since 2008 (n=15 586), and identified 212 confirmed COVID-19 cases between February 12 and June 12, 2020. We conducted risk analyses to identify the effect of demographics, comorbidities and associated medication use, and lifestyle factors and with appropriate adjustment for gender, ethnicity, age group and HPB diagnoses on COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Results We observed an increased risk of COVID-19 for men (Relative Risk, RR=1.59; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.09) and Black ethnicity (RR=2.2; 95% CI 1.5 to 3.18). Substance mis-users were at more risk of infection, so were patients on Vitamin D treatment. The higher risks associated with South Asian ethnicity, patients with pre-existing non-malignant pancreatic or liver conditions, age>70, and past smokers were due to co-existing comorbidities; surprisingly current smokers were associated with a lower risk. Increased mortality risk was observed for Black ethnicity (RR=2.4; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.48), and patients with a pre-existing kidney condition (RR=2.13; 95% CI 1.16 to 3.55) - particularly when accompanied with an acute episode of renal complications (RR=2.74; 95% CI 1.32 to 5.13). Conclusions This large multi-ethnic population-based study of HPB patients shows a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 for male gender, Black ethnicity, medical co-morbidities, and substance mis-users. Particular attention should be paid to patients with a pre-existing kidney disease for further renal insult to prevent fatality.","Dayem Ullah, A. Z. M.; Sivapalan, L.; Chelala, C.; Kocher, H.

However, among many treatment interventions being tested globally, beneficial effects and clinical improvements have been reported when convalescent plasma is used for treating COVID-19 patients. We prepared a guiding protocol for treating early to moderate COVID-19 patients with plasma transfusion from convalescent COVID-19 patients. This protocol was deduced based on previously published reports and studies that evaluated and tested convalescent plasma as a prospective therapy for COVID-19 patients. The protocol covers instructions on patient and donor selection criteria, plasma harvesting, plasma product specifications, dosage and precautions for convalescent plasma collection and transfusion process. Altogether, we prepared a treatment protocol that is tailored to the context of Sudan to be adopted by Sudan's health authority. Moreover, it will also provide reference for researchers to design open label clinical trials for convalescent plasma transfusion.","Hassan, Mozan Osman; Osman, Asma Ahmed; Elbasit, Hana Elsir Abd; Hassan, Hanan Elsamani; Rufai, Hala; Satti, Maria M.M.; Elnegoumi, Musab; Idris, Roaa; Musa, Ashraf; Ali, Abdelhakam H.; Zroog, Susan Ali; Khairy, Amna; Allam, Mushal; Abdelhalim, Asaad Tageldein Idris",Transfus Apher Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900597/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473050220302329; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transci.2020.102918; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473050220302329?v=s5,761

While prophylactic anticoagulation is now widely recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with COVID-19 has not been established. STUDY DESIGN: : PREVENT-HD is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic, event-driven phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in symptomatic outpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at risk for thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death. Several challenges posed by the pandemic have necessitated innovative approaches to clinical trial design, start-up, and conduct. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by time from COVID-19 confirmation, to either rivaroxaban 10mg once daily or placebo for 35 days. The primary efficacy endpoint is a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non-central nervous systemic embolization, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. The primary safety endpoint is fatal and critical site bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition. Enrollment began in August 2020 and is expected to enroll approximately 4000 participants to yield the required number of endpoint events. CONCLUSIONS: : PREVENT-HD is a pragmatic trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban in the outpatient setting to reduce major venous and arterial thrombotic events, hospitalization, and mortality associated with COVID-19.","Capell, Warren H.; Barnathan, Elliot S.; Piazza, Gregory; Spyropoulos, Alex C.; Hsia, Judith; Bull, Scott; Lipardi, Concetta; Sugarmann, Chiara; Suh, Eunyoung; Rao, Jaya Prakash; Hiatt, William R.; Bonaca, Marc P.",Am Heart J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577800/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2021.02.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002870321000338; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870321000338?v=s5,761

646149,Influenza vaccination in the COVID-19 era,2020-06-18,"Although previous studies have demonstrated an association between vaccine attitudes and cognitive biases, often resulting in vaccination hesitancy, the exact contribution of rationality has not been fully clarified. We tested two hypotheses regarding the impact of rationality on vaccine attitudes stemming from bounded and expressive rationality. We focused on parental vaccine attitudes operationalized by the affective, behavioral, and cognitive attitude components and investigated how these are influenced by disillusionment toward authorities and ability to engage in rational thinking operationalized using cognitive reflection and heuristics and biases tasks. The study was of a cross‐sectional correlational design with a non‐probabilistic sample of 823 volunteer participants surveyed online in April and May 2018 in Croatia. The results identified disillusionment toward authorities as a predictor of all components. Furthermore, performance on heuristics and biases tasks also predicted the affective and cognitive, but not the behavioral component, whereas cognitive reflection had no impact on vaccine attitudes. Next, a moderation effect of disillusionment toward authorities on the association between the omission bias task and all attitude components was identified. Parents with low disillusionment demonstrated positive vaccine attitudes regardless of their rationality, whereas for parents with high disillusionment a significant positive correlation between performance on the omission bias task as assessed with a vaccination vignette and attitudes was identified. This suggests that the ability to resist vaccine specific omission bias, that is, higher rationality, can decrease the negative effects of disillusionment, which supports the bounded rationality hypothesis.","Tomljenovic, Helena; Bubic, Andreja; Erceg, Nikola",J Behav Decis Mak,https://doi.org/10.1002/bdm.2260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518738/,761

653988,Re-orienting policy for growing food to nourish communities,2020-05-18,"We surveyed three well-established store-and-forward telemedicine networks to identify any changes during the first half of 2020, which might have been due to the effect of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic on their telemedicine operations. The three networks all used the Collegium Telemedicus system. Various quantitative performance indicators, which included the numbers of referrals and the case-mix, were compared with their values in previous years. Two of the three networks surveyed (A and B) provided telemedicine services for any type of medical or surgical case, while the third (network C) handled only pediatric radiology cases. All networks operated in Africa, but networks A and C also provided services in other resource-constrained regions. Two of the networks (networks B and C) used local staff to submit referrals, while network A relied mainly on its expatriate staff. During the first half of 2020, the numbers of referrals received on network B increased substantially, while in contrast, the numbers of referrals on network A declined. All three networks had relatively stable referral rates during 2018 and 2019. All three networks delivered a service that was rated highly by the referrers. One network operated at relatively high efficiency compared to the other two, although it is not known if this is sustainable. The networks which were more reliant on local referrers saw little reduction—or even an increase—in submitted cases, while the network that had the most dependence on international staff saw a big fall in submitted cases. This was probably due to the effect of international travel restrictions on the deployment of its staff. We conclude that organizations wanting to build or expand their telemedicine services should consider deliberately empowering local providers as their referrers.","Wootton, Richard; Otero, Hansel; Moretti, Meghan",Int J Telemed Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34093705/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6644648,761

Copanlisib is a highly selective and potent intravenous pan-class I PI3K inhibitor that has demonstrated durable objective responses and a manageable safety profile in heavily pre-treated patients with indolent lymphomas. As a result, copanlisib monotherapy received accelerated approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with relapsed follicular lymphoma who have received at least two systemic therapies, and breakthrough designation for patients with pre-treated relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma. Hyperglycemia and hypertension are among the most frequently reported adverse events with copanlisib monotherapy, and are infusion-related, transient, and manageable with standard therapies. Mild diarrhea is also a common adverse event with copanlisib monotherapy; there is no evidence of worsening severity of diarrhea, or serious gastrointestinal toxicities such as colitis or severe liver enzyme elevations, which have been reported with orally administered PI3K inhibitors. The intravenous route of administration and intermittent dosing schedule of copanlisib may support a favorable tolerability profile over continually administered oral alternatives. Ongoing studies of copanlisib in combination with rituximab and standard-of-care chemotherapy in patients with relapsed indolent lymphoma have the potential to support the use of copanlisib in the second-line setting, providing a much-needed additional therapeutic option in this underserved patient population.","Munoz, Javier; Follows, George A.; Nastoupil, Loretta J.",Target Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33687623/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11523-021-00802-9,761

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 67 collected cases was conducted and included approximately 67 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to the Suzhou Fifth People’s Hospital from January 1, 2020 to February 8, 2020. The epidemiological, clinical and imaging characteristics as well as laboratory data of the 67 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: The study found that fibrinogen (FIB) was increased in 45 (65.2%) patients, and when FIB reached a critical value of 4.805 g/L, the sensitivity and specificity、DA, helping to distinguish general and severe cases, were 100 and 14%、92.9%, respectively, which were significantly better than those for lymphocyte count and myoglobin. Chest CT images indicated that the cumulative number of lung lobes with lesions in severe patients was significantly higher than that in general patients (P < 0.05), and the cumulative number of lung lobes with lesions was negatively correlated with lymphocyte count and positively correlated with myoglobin and FIB. Our study also found that there was no obvious effect of hormone therapy in patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the retrospective analysis, FIB was found to be increased in severe patients and was better than lymphocyte count and myoglobin in distinguishing general and severe patients. The study also suggested that hormone treatment has no significant effect on COVID-19.","Wang, Yi; Yao, Lin; Zhang, Jian-Ping; Tang, Pei-Jun; Ye, Zhi-Jian; Shen, Xing-Hua; Xu, Jun-Chi; Wu, Mei-Ying; Yu, Xin",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05468-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046047/,761

The use of anti-androgen drugs, like 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs), could protect from severe pulmonary disease. Objective: To determine whether men who received 5ARIs for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) have a lower risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. Design: This is a case-control study on patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (cases), matched to beneficiaries of the Lombardy Regional Health Service (controls). Setting: Data were collected by two high-volume COVID-19 regional centres of Lombardy (Italy) from 1st March to 24th April 2020. Participants: Consecutive patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus according to the WHO guidance, who required hospitalization. Exposure: BPH treatment with 5ARIs (finasteride/dutasteride) in the last six months . Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary outcome was to compare the prevalence of male patients chronically exposed to 5ARIs, who required hospitalization for COVID-19, with the one of age-matched males in Lombardy. Results: Overall, 1,432 COVID-19 patients were included. Among the 943 males, 45 (4.77%) patients were exposed to chronic 5ARI therapy. COVID-19 patients aged >55 years under 5ARI treatment were significantly less than expected on the basis of the prevalence of 5ARI treatment among age-matched controls (5.57 vs. 8.14%; p=0.0083, 95%CI=0.75-3.97%). This disproportion was even higher for men aged >65 (7.14 vs. 12.31%; p=0.0001, 95%CI=2.83-6.97%). Eighteen 5ARIs-patients died; the mean age of men who died was higher than those who did not: 75.98{+/-}9.29 vs. 64.78{+/-}13.57 (p<0.001). Cox regression and multivariable models did not show any correlation between the exposure to 5ARIs and protection against ICU admission or death: HR=0.79 (95%CI=0.54-1.15; p=0.22) and OR=1.23 (95%CI=0.81-1.87; p=0.33), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case-control study the use of 5ARIs was less frequent among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 than among controls, suggesting that men exposed to 5ARIs might be less vulnerable to severe COVID-19. This observation further supports the idea to test in randomized clinical trials whether anti-androgen therapies can prevent the transition from paucisymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection to overt pulmonary disease.","Lazzeri, Massimo; Duga, Stefano; Azzolini, Elena; Fasulo, Vittorio; Buffi, Nicolo; Saita, Alberto; Force, - The Humanitas COVID-19 Task; Force, - The Humanitas Gavazzeni COVID-19 Task; Hurle, Rodolfo; Nobili, Alessandro; Cecconi, Maurizio; Casale, Paolo; Asselta, Rosanna",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.20068056; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20068056v1?rss=1,761

Conversely, many diseases (such as atherosclerosis, arthritis, bacterial infections (tuberculosis), viral infections (COVID-19), and cancer), cholesterol-lowering drugs (such as statins), and tetracycline-class antibiotics (such as doxycycline) alter MMP activity through transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms. In this review, we summarize evidence that the aforementioned diseases and drugs exert significant epigenetic pressure on genes encoding MMPs, tissue inhibitors of MMPs, and factors that transcriptionally regulate the expression of MMPs. Our understanding of human pathologies associated with alterations in the proteolytic activity of MMPs must consider that these pathologies and their medicinal treatments may impose epigenetic pressure on the expression of MMP genes. Whether the epigenetic mechanisms affecting the activity of MMPs can be therapeutically targeted warrants further research.","Sarker, Hassan; Haimour, Ayman; Toor, Ravneet; Fernandez-Patron, Carlos",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33920915/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11040578,761
